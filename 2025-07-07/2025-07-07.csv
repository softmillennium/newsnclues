            Former Russian Transport Minister Roman Starovoit died by suicide on Monday, just hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin fired him from the job, officials said.
    


            Starovoit was dismissed by Putin on Monday morning. The decree announcing his dismissal was published on the official Kremlin website, with his deputy Andrey Nikitin appointed acting minister.
    


            Asked by reporters for the reasons behind Starovoit's dismissal, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied this was due to a “lack of trust,” but he did not give any alternative reason.
    


            The Investigative Committee of Russia said in a statement that Starovoit's body was found inside a car in Odintsovo, a suburb of Moscow. He was found with a gunshot wound, the committee said. It said the circumstances of his death were being investigated but the “main theory is suicide.”
    


            Before he became a minister in May 2024, Starovoit was the governor of the southern Russian Kursk region. While he left the post before Ukraine's surprise incursion, he was partially blamed for security failures in the Russian region.
    


            Russian media reported on Monday that Starovoit has been implicated in an investigation into the embezzlement of state funds allocated for building fortifications in the region. Vesti, a state TV program, as well as RBC, a Russian independent business media outlet, and the Russian business daily newspaper Kommersant reported that he was being investigated. Kommersant said Starovoit was facing an arrest.
    


            Alexei Smirnov, Starovoit's predecessor in the Kursk governor role who was previously his deputy, was arrested in the same case in April this year, according to court in Moscow.
    


            The dismissal came amid a multi-day disruption to air travel in Russia. Russian Federal Agency for Air Transport said 485 flights were canceled, 88 were diverted and 1,900 were delayed over the weekend and into Monday.
    


            The agency said the cancellations were down to “external interference,” without giving any specifics. But the Russian Defense Ministry said more than 400 Ukrainian long-range strikes were intercepted during the same period of time.
    


            The Ukrainian military said it also struck a chemical plant in Krasnozavodsk, north of Moscow early on Monday. It said the plant manufactures “pyrotechnic devices and ammunition, including thermobaric warheads for Shahed-type” drones.
    


            At least 12 civilians were killed and more than 90 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine in the 24 hours to mid-morning on Monday, according to Ukrainian authorities.
    


            At least 29 people, including three children aged 3, 7 and 11, were injured when Russian drones hit a residential building, a kindergarten and a commercial area at 6 a.m. local time Monday (11 p.m. ET on Sunday) in Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine.
    


            At least 17 more people, including a teenage boy, were injured when the same city was struck with drones again just five hours later, according to Kharkiv mayor Ihor Terekhov.
    


            The Ukrainian Air Force said Russia fired four surface-to-air missiles and 101 Shahed-type drones at Ukraine in the past 24 hours, adding that it downed 75 of the drones either by shooting them down or by jamming.
    


            The Land Forces of Ukraine said on Monday that two of its recruitment offices were hit by Russian drones on Monday, the latest in a string of similar incidents.
    


            Six draft offices across the country have been attacked by Russian drones in just over a week, the Land Forces said in a statement, adding that they believed Russia was attacking the offices in an attempt to disrupt the Ukrainian military's enlistment process.
    


            At least two people have been killed and more than a dozen injured in these attacks, the statement said.

            “Something can be born out of everything – if you want it to,” said Iris Haim, whose hostage son Yotam was killed in Gaza. Those words are helping her find hope.
    


            The new beginning that Haim now longs for is a grandchild, created from sperm she had harvested from Yotam's body upon its return home in December 2023.
    


            “Yes, a disaster happened,” Haim, 59, told CNN of her son's killing from the Israeli town of Mevaseret Zion, a few miles west of Jerusalem. “But it doesn't control me.”
    


            Yotam, 28, was kidnapped by Hamas-led militants from kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7, 2023. After spending 65 days in captivity, he was mistakenly shot by Israeli troops on December 15, 2023 along with two other hostages, Alon Shamriz and Samer Talalka, as they attempted to flee their captors in northern Gaza.
    


            Yotam is the only Israeli hostage whose sperm is known to have been retrieved posthumously, and whose family is lobbying to use it to have a child.
    


            Haim says Yotam, a single man at the time of his death, always wanted children. “Yotam really wanted that – he talked about it a lot,” she said.

What we know about how 3 Israeli hostages were killed by the IDF



﻿A total of 205 hostages have so far been returned, 148 of whom were released alive, and 57 returned dead, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. Most had been dead for weeks, if not months, making the men's sperm no longer viable for use – except for Yotam's. That's where his mother saw an unexpected opportunity to have what would be her first grandchild.
    


            Chances of successful sperm retrieval are highest in the first 24 hours after death, with the cut-off time being 72 hours, according to the Israeli government.
    


            There are currently 50 Israeli hostages held in Gaza, of whom at least 20 are believed to be alive. Both Hamas and Israel have accepted a new ceasefire proposal and indirect negotiations on a deal have restarted, raising hopes that more could return home soon.
    


            Haim remembers with painful clarity the moment Israeli authorities came to her home and told her about her son's death. “Yotam was killed. By friendly fire. While escaping Hamas captivity. He was mistakenly identified as a terrorist,” Haim recalled the officers saying.
    


            “Four sentences I will never forget,” she told CNN.
    


            Half an hour after they broke the news of Yotam's death, one officer approached Haim and whispered, “you can request sperm retrieval,” Haim said. The process “immediately got started, immediately,” she said.
    


            Yotam's sperm was retrieved within the necessary window of time. Ten samples were extracted, “enough for five children,” Haim recalled being told by the doctor who performed the procedure.
    


            Haim now faces an uphill battle to get approval to use his sperm to produce a grandchild. If she succeeds, her next challenge would be to find a woman to carry the child and raise it.
    


Sperm lives on briefly after death, which is why it's possible for doctors to retrieve it from testicular tissue. Any live sperm cells found are transferred and frozen in liquid nitrogen.
    


            None, however, can be used without approval from a family court, where Haim now faces an uphill battle to continue her son's lineage.

‘We owe it to them': Families of Israelis killed in war find new hope through sperm extraction



            In Israel, extracting sperm from a dead body is permitted, but there is no law that clearly defines the process of using the sperm for the purpose of producing offspring.
    


            “In Israeli law, we don't have a law for this procedure,” Nily Shatz, Haim's lawyer, said, adding that family courts have only approved posthumous use of sperm by parents of the deceased to produce a child twice in the past; however, the second case was later overturned after an appeal brought by the state. “All the other cases were rejected.”
    


            The first case was that of a woman who after years of court battles was able to have a grandchild after proving that her son, who was killed in Gaza in 2002, wanted children, according to Shatz. The court, however, declared that the ruling should not be perceived as a precedent, saying legislators must decide on the matter in the future. The second case was that of a couple who are still fighting in court to have a grandchild with retrieved sperm of their late son, who died in 2012.
    


            Last week, after CNN spoke with Shatz, an Eilat court gave permission in principle for Sharon Eisenkot to use sperm retrieved from her son Maor – a soldier killed in Gaza in 2023 – to have a grandchild through surrogacy. “Should a specific request be submitted regarding the identity of the woman chosen to carry the embryo fertilized with M.'s sperm, it will require the court's approval,” the ruling Thursday said. In keeping with usual practice in family court, the full names of those involved in the case were not given but the court directed CNN to this ruling.
    


            Meirav Ben-Ari, a lawmaker in Israel's parliament, the Knesset, is pushing for a bill that formally allows family members to use retrieved sperm even if the deceased had not specifically stated his wish to have a child posthumously, as long as they can prove the deceased would have wanted a child.
    


            Ben-Ari told CNN the bill “is not moving forward now, because the (governing) coalition objects (to) it, mainly the religious parties.”
    


            Netanyahu's coalition is made up of some of the most religiously conservative parties ever to hold power in Israel, including ultra-Orthodox and far-right religious Zionist factions whose agendas are reshaping the country's legal and social fabric.
    


            Shatz, Haim's lawyer, said that after the horrors of October 7, it was past time for parliament to pass a law on the issue, especially as families of hundreds of fallen soldiers retrieve the sperm of their dead.
    


            But while Haim longs to be a grandmother, the issue of using the sperm of deceased men remains controversial. It raises ethical, religious and legal questions that lawmakers are yet to address.
    


            For now, cases are assessed individually by the family courts, Shatz said. And since there are varying opinions in government about the practice, each case is viewed with extreme caution, she said.
    


            At the moment, for families to use the sperm of their deceased, they must prove to the courts that the person who died wanted children, even after his death.
    


            Yotam's family is working to prove that he wanted children by providing testimony from relatives, friends and his therapist, but such intangible proof is likely to be harder for many others to present.
    


            “There's no logical way (where) usually people say that I want a child, even if I'm going from the world,” Shatz said, noting this isn't something ordinary men think about, especially when young.
    


            Posthumous sperm retrieval (PSR) in Israel was previously open only to partners – provided other relatives did not object – while parents of the deceased had to apply for legal permission. Following the October 7 attacks, the Ministry of Health loosened the rules.
    


            Sperm retrievals have soared since. There have been at least 224 sperm retrievals from fallen soldiers and security personnel, the ministry told CNN, as well as 17 from deceased civilians.
    


            “In previous years, approximately 15–20 such retrievals were performed annually,” the ministry said.
    


            Medical professionals, bereaved families and legal experts have told CNN that the atrocities of October 7 have made questions around how sperm is preserved and used more urgent than ever, as Israeli society grapples with the perceived threat to the Jewish people's existence. Israeli officials have repeatedly compared Hamas' October 7 attacks to Nazi atrocities during World War II, homing in on the narrative that the conflict in Gaza is a war of survival.
    


            For Haim, having a grandchild is a way to prove that Israel will keep growing despite the massacre.
    


            “Every mother whose child was killed wants to have something from that child, not just photos. She wants something tangible,” Haim said, her eyes briefly filling with tears. “As the people of Israel, we need to understand today that, after October 7, we need to keep growing – to show our enemies that our way, this continuity of our lives here in this country, and in general, is through the creation of new life.”

Israel is facing unprecedented pressure from allies over its war on Gaza. Can they force it to change its ways?



            Prof. Hagai Levine, a public health physician and head of the health team at the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, told CNN that Israel's recent wars have driven many in the country to “think about your death, to think about your destiny, about what is most important for you.”
    


            “That forces you to be in this situation. That's what war is doing to us,” he said.
    


            Levine advocates for soldiers to decide early whether they'd like to have children, and for them to preserve their sperm while they are still alive.
    


            Some have also called for soldiers to leave a “biological will,” a testament that lays out an individual's wishes when it comes to posthumous use of eggs or sperm, whether they are retrieved after death or frozen while the person is still alive.
    


            Bella Savitsky, whose son Jonathan died in combat on October 7, opted to retrieve his sperm and got approval for it, but it came too late.
    


            Savitsky, a senior lecturer in the School of Health Sciences at Ashkelon Academic College, said studies show a maximum of 36 hours since time of death is the only time that retrieved sperm can be usable, a shorter timeframe than that cited by the Israeli government. This window is narrower in Israel because the hot weather can affect the sperm's quality in dead bodies, she said.
    


            On October 9, 2023, Savitsky received “the knock on the door” from authorities, telling her that her 21-year-old son had been killed in heavy fighting at an army outpost near Gaza.
    


            Jonathan never wanted to be a soldier, she told CNN. He simply wanted to carry out his mandatory military service and return to civilian life.
    


            “He wanted to get married, to have children, a dog, and a home in the countryside.”
    


            It took many hours for Savitsky to obtain a court order allowing the harvesting of her son's sperm.
    


            “Altogether, it took 70 hours,” she said. “So, when the posthumous sperm retrieval was done, it was not intact. There was no live sperm.”
    


            Sperm retrieval after death undoubtedly raises complex moral, ethical, judicial and religious questions. While technology has advanced, critics say the law has not kept up.
    


            Experts say the controversy stems from the lack of clear consent from the father and the idea of bringing a child into the world who is fatherless from the outset.
    


            “Even if the deceased wanted to be a parent when he was alive, who says he wanted to have a child after his death? It's not the same thing,” Prof. Gil Siegal, head of the Center for Medical Law, Bioethics and Health Policy at Ono Academic College, told CNN.
    


            “You are bringing into the world a child whose parent is known, named and deceased. This has a significant psychological impact and is different from a single-parent family,” Siegal said.
    


            Some may also object to having children that effectively serve as a monument to the deceased father.
    


            In that case, “the grandparents are seeking a ‘memorial' – a form of commemoration – or trying to recreate something that cannot be recreated,” Siegal said. There are also religious considerations, as “retrieving sperm is an intrusive act, and in Judaism, there is a critical prohibition against desecrating the dead,” he said.
    


            To mitigate these issues, Savitsky believes that young men should be asked whether they would want their sperm to be posthumously retrieved before they enter army service, but said the ministry of defense may be wary of implementing this as it could dent troop morale.
    


            For Haim, despite the difficulties, the battle to have a grandchild gives her strength in the face of the tragedy she faces after October 7, as well as hope for the future.
    


            In May, the State Attorney's Office gave a green light in principle for Haim to use Yotam's sperm. That was a first step towards what may be a long journey for her to have a grandchild. The family still needs to present evidence to prove that Yotam would have wanted a child, Shatz, Haim's lawyer said.
    


            “In the end, the reality did happen to us on October 7. So now – what will we do with that reality? Cry, wail, say, why did this happen to us?” she asked.
    


            “Yes, a disaster happened. Period. But what else happened? A lot of amazing things also happened. That's where I'm aiming (for).”

            Shares in Tesla tanked by as much as 7.6% in premarket trading Monday after its CEO Elon Musk said he is forming a new American political party, provoking an irate response from US President Donald Trump.
    


            Tesla stock (TSLA) later recovered some of its earlier losses but then opened down 7.6% at the start of regular trading at 9:30 a.m. ET.
    


            “I'm saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely ‘off the rails,' essentially becoming a TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform late Sunday, also mentioning Musk's Saturday announcement that he is forming a political party to rival the main Republican and Democratic parties.
    


            Ahead of boarding Air Force One in New Jersey Sunday, Trump also called Musk's announcement “ridiculous” and said it would sow confusion.

Musk says he is forming new political party after fallout with Trump



            Neil Wilson, a strategist at UK trading platform Saxo Markets, said Monday that Tesla investors were concerned on two fronts: firstly, that further friction between Musk and Trump would lead to additional cuts to US government EV subsidies and, secondly, that Musk appeared “distracted.”
    


            “Investors had cheered Musk stepping back from frontline politics but are now worried he's going to (be) sucked back in and take his eye off Tesla,” Wilson wrote in a note.
    


            Trump and Musk began trading barbs in early June after the Tesla CEO criticized Trump's so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill” — a massive tax and domestic policy bill, which the president signed into law last week. Musk has argued that the policies will add trillions of dollars to the federal budget deficit.
    


            “When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk said on his social media platform, X, Saturday. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
    


            Trump, in his Sunday post, said third political parties “have never succeeded in the United States” and that “the one thing (they) are good for is the creation of Complete and Total DISRUPTION & CHAOS.”
    


            Tesla stock on Monday was on track for its biggest single-day loss since June 5, when Musk and Trump traded barbs on social media.
    


            Tesla's fortunes have taken a turn in recent months as it has grappled with intensifying competition from rival EV makers and the fallout from Musk's foray into US politics.
    


            Last week, the company reported a record fall in second-quarter sales, selling 13.5% fewer vehicles compared with the same period in 2024. For that year, Tesla has also reported its first-ever annual decline in sales as a public company. The drop was small — around 1% — though it marks a striking turnaround for an automaker historically accustomed to robust sales growth.
    


            Notably, Tesla is poised to lose its title as the world's largest EV maker, based on annual sales, to Chinese automaker BYD, even though BYD has not entered the US market.
    


            Meanwhile, Musk's recent involvement at the wheel of the US government, helming the Department of Government Efficiency and spearheading mass layoffs of federal workers, has, among other controversies, sparked protests outside Tesla's showrooms worldwide.
    


            In May, Musk announced he would step down from his government position, raising hopes among investors that he will now have more time to work on his companies, which include SpaceX and X. But the billionaire's feud with Trump, and likely upcoming attempts to woo voters to his new party, have thrust him back into the political arena.
    


            Shares of Tesla nearly doubled after election day, setting a record high in mid-December thanks to investor expectations that an alliance between Trump and Musk would be beneficial for Tesla. But the controversy and blowback caused by Musk's political activities sent shares tumbling, and they've lost more than a third of their value from since.

EU officials are concerned that Washington could one day stop providing critical software updates for US-made military equipment, according to a New York Times report. The fear stems from uncertainty over the future of NATO and the policies of US President Donald Trump.  

The EU has committed nearly €14 trillion ($16.4 trillion) to defense investments over the next decade. Last month, the European Commission authorized the use of around €335 billion in pandemic recovery funds for military purposes. In May, it introduced a €150 billion debt facility to support defense efforts. Ukraine has been granted access to these funds alongside EU member states. Russia has denounced the steps as evidence of continued hostility by the bloc.  

However, the EU is embarking on the unprecedented military spending spree without the technology base to match its ambitions, the outlet said on Sunday. The bloc lacks viable alternatives to advanced US-made military systems, including the F-35 stealth fighter, which costs around $80 million per jet. The absence of such capabilities raises doubts about the EU's ability to achieve strategic autonomy, according to the report.  

The bloc remains deeply dependent on American platforms – from missile-defense systems and rocket launchers to cyber warfare tools – all of which rely on regular software updates from the US.    

Some officials fear that Washington could ultimately withhold essential software updates – a concern heightened by Donald Trump's renewed outreach to Russia and his skepticism toward NATO commitments, the NYT said.   

NATO members have since agreed to spend 3.5% on core military budgets and another 1.5% earmarked for areas such as cyber defenses and the preparation of civilian infrastructure.  

Concerns over tech dependency have become more urgent since the Trump administration suspended shipments of certain weapons to Ukraine, leaving EU nations to fill the gap, the NYT noted. Moscow has welcomed the move, suggesting that the freeze could speed up the end of the conflict.  

Discussions continue in the EU over whether to build its own military industry or remain reliant on US technology, the report said. The mixed approach suggests that the bloc may continue to depend on key American technologies, even as it seeks greater defense independence.  

The debate comes amid speculation in the Western media and among some officials that Russia is preparing to eventually attack NATO countries in Europe. Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed such notions as “nonsense,” saying Moscow has no intention of invading NATO and that the US-led bloc is fueling an arms race and fabricating threats to justify higher spending.

Germany's Green Party has called on ice cream vendors in Berlin to offer scoops at a reduced price to children and teenagers from low-income families, local tabloid B.Z. has reported. The move comes as a recent survey indicated that nearly two-thirds (64%) of people in Germany believe ice cream prices are too high, with some respondents adjusting their consumption due to increased costs. Three Berlin state parliamentarians from the Greens – Benedikt Lux, Tuba Bozkurt, and Marianne Burkert-Eulitz – appealed to the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga), proposing that at least one flavor per shop be offered for just 50 cents ($0.60), B.Z. reported on Friday, citing a letter reviewed by the outlet. “We would be pleased to enter into a more in-depth discussion with you on this matter in the near future and to consider whether this is a viable proposal to make summer even more enjoyable for everyone in our beautiful city,” the politicians wrote, as cited by the newspaper. The MPs stressed that the cap would be voluntary, but expressed hope that small, independently run parlors would take part. “A more affordable offer could increase demand,” the letter stated. Dehoga's managing director, Gerrit Buchhorn, said he was open to discussions but objected to the language used. “The term ‘price cap' is rather an unfortunate choice of words. But if this is about disadvantaged children and young people, then we're open to dialogue,” he said. The lawmakers acknowledged that ice cream producers are also struggling with rising costs, including rent, energy, and wages. In Berlin, a single scoop can cost up to €2.90 (about $3.13). The national average stands at €1.81 (around $1.95), according to tz.de. An estimated 17.4% of Berlin residents live in poverty, according to Germany's Federal Statistical Office. Rising living costs have forced many families to cut back on non-essential items, including seasonal treats. The Greens' appeal follows their loss in Berlin's February state election, where the party received just 11.6% of the vote and exited the ruling coalition. Party leaders have since pledged to reconnect with the public and rebuild trust.

Germany's economy, which slipped into recession in 2023 and endured two years of contraction, is forecast to return to modest growth in 2025, with the Kiel Institute raising its outlook to 0.3% and projecting 1.6% expansion in 2026. While recent data signals tentative recovery, economists warn it is premature to celebrate, citing weak industrial output, sluggish exports, and persistent geopolitical risks that could derail the fragile rebound.

Elon Musk has said his new “America Party” will focus on disrupting the two-party system in the US Congress, declaring that he aims to challenge the dominance of both Republicans and Democrats ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. 

The remarks follow the tech billionaire's announcement over the weekend that he is moving forward with plans to launch a new political party. Musk has positioned the America Party as an alternative to what he called the “Republican/Democrat Uniparty,” accusing both groups of mismanaging the country's finances and stifling voter choice.

“Backing a candidate for president is not out of the question, but the focus for the next 12 months is on the House and the Senate,” Musk wrote on X on Sunday, outlining his priority to target the US midterm elections in November 2026, when 33 of the 100 Senate seats and all 435 House seats will be up for grabs.

“The way we're going to crack the uniparty system is by using a variant of how Epaminondas shattered the myth of Spartan invincibility at Leuctra: extremely concentrated force at a precise location on the battlefield,” Musk previously stated.

The entrepreneur also doubled down on his criticism of President Donald Trump's fiscal policy, questioning the value of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a temporary agency Trump appointed him to lead.

“What the heck was the point of @DOGE if he's just going to increase the debt by $5 trillion??” Musk wrote.

In a post on Truth Social earlier on Sunday, Trump criticized Musk for what he described as erratic behavior in recent weeks, calling the entrepreneur a “train wreck” and accusing him of promoting “disruption and chaos” that undermines the stability of the American political system.

“I am saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely ‘off the rails,' essentially becoming a TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks,” Trump wrote. “He even wants to start a Third Political Party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States – the system seems not designed for them.”

Musk, who supported Trump during his election victory last year, stepped down from his role in DOGE last month after clashing with the administration over a sweeping tax and spending package known as the “Big Beautiful Bill.” The legislation, signed into law on July 4, includes trillions of dollars in new expenditures, cuts to social programs, and a sharp increase to the federal debt ceiling.

WASHINGTON, July 7. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump described as ridiculous Elon Musk's plans to establish a third party in his country.

""I think it's ridiculous to start a third party. We have a tremendous success with the Republican Party,"" Trump said when asked to comment on Musk's idea adding that ""it's always been a two-party system"" in the United States. ""I think starting a third party just adds to confusion,"" he argued. Even as Musk can ""have fun with it,"" ""third parties have never worked,"" the US leader shared with reporters before boarding Air Force One en route from New Jersey.

Earlier, Musk, the wealthiest person on the planet, announced establishing the America Party based on the results of a vote on his page on X.

On June 30, the US billionaire entrepreneur called for the creation of a third US political party as he renewed criticism of Trump's signature bill to slash federal spending. On July, Trump signed the tax and spending bill into law after the Senate approved the legislation.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

WASHINGTON, July 7. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose an additional 10% tariff on countries supporting policies being pursued by the BRICS grouping.

""Any country aligning themselves with the anti-American policies of BRICS, will be charged an additional 10% tariff. There will be no exceptions to this policy,"" the US leader warned on his Truth Social media platform.

In June, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov, who also serves as Russia's BRICS Sherpa, told the TASS Analytical Center in an interview that the developments at BRICS have not only caused dissatisfaction among the US leader but they also expose the problem of egotism, in the context of external policies, facing the West.

Henry Patten, 29, says he is appealing against decision ‘due to inaccuracies and procedural failures'

The defending Wimbledon men's doubles champion has been handed the largest fine so far at this year's championships after allegedly verbally abusing a member of staff.
  Essex-born Henry Patten, 29, is appealing against the $12,500 (£9,200) penalty that was dished out on 29 June owing to an incident at an off-site training ground.
  Wimbledon has handed out fines totalling $50,000 to 12 players so far this year, more than double the $20,000 dished out during the same period at last year's championships. The fines for both years include the qualifying period and the first week of Wimbledon.
  This year's second highest fine went to the French player Adrian Mannarino, who displayed unsportsmanlike conduct during his second round win over Valentin Royer. Other players this year were fined for audible obscenities, abuse of rackets and equipment, and also unsportsmanlike conduct.

Over the years, some of the sport's biggest stars including Serena Williams and Nick Kyrgios have been fined for rocking the genteel atmosphere of the tournament.

Williams was fined $10,000 (£7,345) in 2016 for smashing her racket into the grass court five times in her match against Christina McHale. Kyrgios, known for his volatile behaviour on the tennis circuit, told a podcast last week that he has been fined more than $800,000 (£587,650) in his career.

Patten said he was disappointed that he was having to address the fines issue rather than concentrating on his Wimbledon run. Patten and his teammate, Harri Heliövaara of Finland, who won the Australian Open men's doubles title this year as well, are through to Wimbledon's quarter-finals after their opponents, France's Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Australia's Jordan Thompson, had to withdraw on Monday.

In a statement, Patten, the world No 3 in doubles, said he had spoken to the tournament referee and tournament director regarding last Sunday's incident.
 “On 2 July, I received a letter informing me that I had been fined and on the same day I responded appealing [against] the decision due to inaccuracies and procedural failures in the process,” he said.
 “Despite this decision being under appeal, I am disappointed that Wimbledon sought it appropriate to disclose this fine to the media without indicating my appeal, which creates an unfair and inaccurate perception of the incident.
 “At this stage I will merely say that I do not believe that there has been a full or proper investigation, nor has Wimbledon acted reasonably or fairly with due process.”
 Wimbledon has been asked for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Joint attack on Iran puts Israeli PM in powerful position as he dangles prospect of Trump-brokered ceasefire deal

Donald Trump will host Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington DC on Monday as the US president seeks again to broker a peace deal in Gaza and the Israeli prime minister takes a victory lap through the Oval Office after a joint military campaign against Iran and a series of successful strikes against Tehran and its proxies in the Middle East.

Netanyahu and Trump have a complex personal relationship – and Trump openly vented frustration at him last month during efforts to negotiate a truce with Iran – but the two have appeared in lockstep since the US launched a bombing run against Iran's nuclear programme, fulfilling a key goal for Israeli war planners.

Netanyahu arrives in Washington in a strong political position, observers have said, potentially giving him the diplomatic cover he would need to end the war in Gaza without facing a revolt from his rightwing supporters that could lead to the collapse of his government.

Hamas this week responded “positively” to a 60-day Israeli ceasefire proposal. But its negotiators have sought for Israel to guarantee a permanent end to the war and to manage the distribution of aid in Gaza through the UN, rather than the US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has had a tumultuous rollout marred by near-daily incidents of Israeli soldiers opening fire on civilians gathering near its distribution sites, killing hundreds of people.

Israel has said the proposed changes to a ceasefire proposal are unacceptable, but Netanyahu has said he will nonetheless send negotiators to Qatar for indirect talks with Hamas. Before boarding his flight to the US on Sunday, Netanyahu said Israel had an opportunity “to expand the circle of peace far beyond what we could have imagined”.

Netanyahu also said Israeli negotiators heading to ceasefire talks in Qatar had clear instructions to achieve a ceasefire agreement under conditions Israel had accepted, Reuters reported, and added that Trump could help achieve those goals.

“We have already transformed the Middle East beyond recognition, and we now have a chance to bring a great future to the people of Israel and the Middle East,” he said.

Those will be the first talks in six weeks and Trump has told reporters he is very optimistic about the potential for a ceasefire. “There could be a Gaza deal next week,” Trump told reporters onboard Air Force One on Friday.

Before the meetings, Netanyahu's top strategic adviser, Ron Dermer, huddled with the US vice-president, JD Vance, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the US envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, for consultations in Washington. During those meetings, the Guardian has been told, the two sides discussed postwar conditions that would allow Israel to banish Hamas from the Gaza Strip and task the international community with responsibility for its rebuilding.

“We have no interest to stay in Gaza,” Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Damon, said in response to a question from the Guardian. “I think we will make sure that in terms of security, we have the ability to act in Gaza, very similar to what's happening today in Judea and Samaria,” territories known internationally as the occupied West Bank.

Hamas has pushed for guarantees from the US that Israel will end the war permanently. Damon, however, said an initial 60-day ceasefire was “not a commitment for ending the war”, and that further discussions on a permanent ceasefire would take place in that period.

“We're going to have to think about the mechanism which will allow Israel to declare that the war is over, will allow international organisations and other players to step in and we make sure that Hamas is not there,” he said.

US and Israeli officials have said they believe the military campaign in Gaza – which has killed more than 57,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians – has allowed Netanyahu to effectively dictate terms to Hamas and that the group has very little leverage in negotiations.

The latest version of the deal would have Hamas release 28 Israeli hostages – 10 alive and 18 bodies – over the course of the 60-day ceasefire. The UN and Palestine Red Crescent Society would be given additional licence to expand aid operations in Gaza. The Israeli army would withdraw first from parts of northern Gaza, and one week later would pull out from parts of the south.

The deal would leave approximately 22 hostages, 10 of them alive, still held in Gaza.

Netanyahu has boasted that his expected meetings in Washington with Trump and other senior officials, including Vance, the secretary of defence, Pete Hegseth, and Rubio, were in part achieved by Israel's readiness to confront Iran.

“These come in the wake of the great victory that we achieved,” Netanyahu said in remarks to the Israeli government. “Taking advantage of the success is no less an important part of achieving the success.”

A key question is whether Trump's patience with Netanyahu will last. He has at times been frustrated with the slow pace of negotiations over the Gaza ceasefire. “MAKE THE DEAL IN GAZA. GET THE HOSTAGES BACK!!! DJT,” he wrote on social media a week ago.

And as he sought to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Iran last week, he had what looked like a minor meltdown as he complained on the White House lawn: “[Iran] violated [the ceasefire] but Israel violated it, too ... I'm not happy with Israel,” he said. “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing.”

As Netanyahu comes to Washington on Monday for the third time since Trump's inauguration, he appears to know exactly what he is doing. And while Trump has touted his bona fides as a dealmaker, the decision for when and how a ceasefire is implemented in Gaza appears ultimately out of his hands.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The 10 current BRICS+ members, more than most countries, can empathize with the economic and political injustices that Africans have experienced over the years. Many of them, including the continent's three members — South Africa, Egypt and Ethiopia — are all too familiar with the disastrous effects of colonialism and exploitation, the difficulty of creating prosperity for millions of people while shouldering an unsustainable debt burden, and the inequality built into the global financial system.

These links have helped foster a closer relationship between BRICS+ members and African countries over the past two decades. For the past 15 years, China has been Africa's largest trading partner, with annual turnover now estimated at US$295 billion. The continent's trade with other BRICS+ members has also increased, reaching US$83 billion with India last year, and more than US$21 billion with Brazil in 2023.

These relationships have pushed many African countries toward industrialization, but only South Africa, Egypt and Morocco have developed any significant amount of industrial power. For the rest of the continent, three major obstacles stand in the way: a huge energy gap, unsustainable debt burdens and worsening climate change. To overcome these barriers, Africa must develop a strategic partnership with the BRICS+. This partnership would yield other mutually beneficial results, including economic growth and shared prosperity.

The timing is right. More than ever before, Africa is facing growth pressures, as evidenced by its exploding working-age population. The BRICS+ bloc is also at a crucial point as it seeks to assert itself on the world stage, develop a new form of multilateralism based on mutualism, expand the New Development Bank and admit more members. The group is attempting to do all this while navigating delicate relations with the US.

A strategic partnership with Africa would allow the BRICS+ bloc to advance its vision for a world where all countries are respected and work together to solve common problems and pursue green development. But to drive growth, its members would need to become coinvestors, rather than merely creditors. They must also help African countries address the obstacles to their development, particularly the energy and debt crises.

To that end, China, one of the most powerful BRICS+ members and the world's clean-energy leader, could help Africa harness its abundant renewable-energy potential. The continent is home to 60 percent of the best solar resources globally, but only 1 percent of installed solar capacity. By contrast, 64 percent of all renewable-energy capacity added last year was installed in China, which accounts for 60 percent of the world's production capacity in green-tech sectors and dominates solar supply chains. As part of a strategic partnership with Africa, China and other BRICS+ countries could coestablish clean-tech manufacturing and assembly plants on the continent. This would create new markets for renewables while also lowering energy costs for Africans.

There is also the question of debt relief. Sovereign-debt restructurings have been inefficient and ineffective, because powerful bilateral and multilateral creditors cannot agree on how to handle them. Improving these processes requires political goodwill. China has shown that this is possible by forgiving US$3.4 billion in African debt, as well as 23 interest-free loans for 17 African countries.

Moreover, BRICS+ countries could oversee the creation of a multilateral framework, tailored to low-income countries, that would aim to convene all creditor classes, including private bondholders and multilateral development banks. This would also facilitate market creation and foster geopolitical ties between the bloc's members and African countries — the foundations of a prosperous future for all.

With the right strategic partners, Africa could become very wealthy in a short period of time. The BRICS+ bloc must begin laying the groundwork for this geopolitical and economic alliance with the continent at its upcoming summit in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil, as the current president, and South Africa, as the group's first African member, must ensure that an African partnership is at the top of the agenda.

From a practical point of view, deepening cooperation with African countries would create future economic benefits for BRICS+ members, but perhaps more importantly, it would signal the group's willingness to provide equitable opportunities to the broader global south.

Department store executives admit that business is tough, but they also stress that the root cause is not a drop in Taiwan's spending power or a surge in outbound travel. Instead, a

U.S. President Donald Trump said on July 6 that his administration will impose an additional 10% tariff on countries aligning themselves with what he described as the BRICS group's ""anti-American policy.""

""There will be no exceptions to this policy,"" Trump wrote on the social network Truth Social.

The announcement coincided with the BRICS summit in Brazil, where member states, including Russia, China, and India, adopted a declaration condemning strikes on Iran and Israel's operations in Gaza. 

The document did not explicitly name the U.S. but criticized actions perceived as destabilizing. On June 21, the country carried out strikes on three major Iranian nuclear sites: Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan.

Trump's latest trade threat escalates tensions with the BRICS group, which has increasingly sought to reduce dependence on the U.S. dollar and shift toward a multipolar world order.

Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, described the summit as the start of a new ""Global South"" era, highlighting the group's aim to reshape the global order.

Though Russian President Vladimir Putin said in October 2024 that there are no immediate plans to create a BRICS currency, he highlighted the group's goal of financial sovereignty.

In January, Trump warned of 100% tariffs on BRICS members if they attempt to adopt a new or existing currency to replace the U.S. dollar in international trade.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov attended the BRICS summit in person, while Putin participated via video due to an outstanding International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant. Brazil, the summit's host, is an ICC member and obligated to arrest Putin if he enters the country.

The declaration also condemned incidents on Russian railway infrastructure and called for a negotiated settlement in the war against Ukraine. However, it avoided urging Russia to halt its full-scale invasion.

BRICS expanded in 2024, admitting Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates as new members. In October 2024, Putin hosted a BRICS forum in Kazan, attended by 36 world leaders.

BRICS summit participants condemned recent attacks on Russia's railway infrastructure, according to a joint declaration on July 6 from Rio de Janeiro.

""We condemn in the strongest possible terms the attacks on bridges and railway infrastructure deliberately targeting civilians in the Bryansk, Kursk and Voronezh regions of the Russian Federation on May 31, and June 1 and 5 2025, which resulted in the deaths of several civilians, including children,"" the document says.

Bryansk, Kursk, and Voronezh oblasts are all located near Ukraine's northeastern border and have played a central role in Russia's war effort, serving as key logistical hubs and launch sites for missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities–often targeting civilian infrastructure and causing casualties.

In their declaration, BRICS leaders also called for a negotiated peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine.

“We recall our national positions concerning the conflict in Ukraine as expressed in the appropriate forum, including the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly,” the document said. “We expect that current efforts will lead to a sustainable peace settlement.”

The statement comes a few days after a phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on July 3, in which Putin said ""Russia will continue to pursue its goals"" in the war against Ukraine, Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov attended the summit in person, while Russian President Vladimir Putin participated via video link.

Brazil is a member of the ICC and a signatory to the Rome Statute, meaning it is obliged to arrest Putin if he enters the country.

The ICC issued a warrant for the Russian leader's arrest in March 2023 over the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children during Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

The BRICS declaration also condemned recent U.S. and Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities as violations of international law and criticized the presence of foreign forces in Syria and Gaza, calling for Israeli withdrawal from Syrian territory.

BRICS, originally composed of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has expanded in recent years to include Iran, Egypt, the UAE, Ethiopia, and Indonesia.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on July 6 that his administration is ""helping a lot"" when it comes to Ukraine, defending his approach to the ongoing war.

""I am helping Ukraine. I'm helping it a lot,"" Trump told reporters when asked in Washington why the U.S. does not support Ukraine as strongly as it supports Israel.

The comment follows a growing outcry in Kyiv over the U.S. Defense Department's decision to pause deliveries of key weapons, including Patriot air defense missiles and precision-guided munitions. 

Ukrainian officials have warned that the delay leaves the country more vulnerable to intensified Russian missile and drone attacks, which have killed and injured hundreds of civilians in recent weeks.

While Trump has repeatedly said he wants to end the war and support Ukraine, his administration has not imposed new sanctions on Russia since he took office in January and has yet to approve additional military assistance packages.

Instead, the Trump administration has prioritized military action in the Middle East. The U.S. launched air strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran on June 21, a move critics say stands in contrast to Washington's cautious posture toward Moscow.

Speaking on Air Force One on July 5, Trump expressed frustration over his July 3 phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

""It just seems like he wants to go all the way and just keep killing people,"" Trump said.

Trump also spoke with President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 4 in what the U.S. president later described as a ""very strategic"" call. Trump said the two discussed Ukraine's urgent need for air defenses.

""They're going to need something because they're being hit pretty hard,"" Trump said, adding that supplying Patriot systems was a possibility.

Despite those comments, there have been no new authorizations for weapons deliveries, and Trump's administration has continued to avoid direct economic pressure on Moscow.

Two rounds of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine held in Istanbul in May and June led only to prisoner exchanges, with no breakthrough on ending hostilities. Moscow has maintained maximalist conditions while rejecting calls for an unconditional ceasefire.

U.S. Special Envoy for Syria Thomas Barrack with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun in Baabda, Lebanon, on Monday. In the hours before Barrack's visit, Israel carried out a wave of air strikes on Lebanon.Lebanese Presidency Press Office/Reuters

A U.S. envoy said on Monday he was “unbelievably satisfied” with Lebanon's reply to a U.S. proposal on disarming Hezbollah, following meetings in Beirut held hours after Israel launched new air strikes and a cross-border incursion.

Envoy Thomas Barrack's proposal, delivered to Lebanese officials during his last visit on June 19, would see Hezbollah fully disarmed within four months in exchange for Israel halting air strikes and withdrawing troops from posts in south Lebanon they still occupy following a war last year.

Speaking to reporters after meeting Lebanon's president on Monday, Barrack said he had received a seven-page reply, although he gave no details of its contents.

“What the government gave us was something spectacular in a very short period of time,” Barrack said. “I'm unbelievably satisfied with the response.”

A U.S. envoy to Lebanon said Monday he was satisfied with the Lebanese government's response to a proposal to disarm the militant Hezbollah group adding that the Washington is ready to help the small crisis-hit nation come out of its historic political and economic crisis.

The Associated Press

Barrack, a longtime adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump who also serves as U.S. ambassador to Turkey and special envoy for Syria, said he believed “the Israelis do not want war with Lebanon”.

“Both countries are trying to give the same thing – the notion of a stand-down agreement, of the cessation of hostilities, and a road to peace,” he said.

Israel crushed the leadership of Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group in a bombing campaign last year, one of many fronts on which it has inflicted severe blows against Iran and its allies since the start of the war in Gaza in 2023.

Hezbollah has already relinquished some weapons and withdrawn from southern areas under a ceasefire agreed last year. Israel has kept troops at five posts in southern Lebanon and continued targeting Hezbollah fighters with air strikes, saying it wants the group to pose no threat to Israel.

An Israeli official, who asked not to be named, said Israel would only withdraw once Hezbollah completely disarmed – and that Israel would keep reinforcing the posts as long as it saw Hezbollah trying to rebuild its forces in south Lebanon.

Hezbollah has not publicly responded to the U.S. disarmament proposal, but its leader said on Sunday the group needed to keep some weapons to defend Lebanon from Israel. Sources have told Reuters that the group is considering shrinking its arsenal, without disarming in full.

Barrack also met with Lebanon's prime minister and its parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, who is an ally of Hezbollah.

Berri's office released a statement saying the meeting was “good and constructive, taking into account Lebanon's interests and sovereignty, the concerns of all Lebanese, and the demands of Hezbollah”.

In the hours before Barrack's visit, Israel carried out a wave of air strikes on Lebanon's south and east as well as a cross-border ground assault on a Lebanese border village. The Israeli escalation was seen by Lebanese officials and diplomats as an attempt to ratchet up pressure on Hezbollah.

Western countries have long said changes in the region could provide a chance for Lebanon to strengthen state institutions that have remained weak for decades in the shadow of powerful sectarian groups.

Barrack said Hezbollah needed reassurance that it would still have a future in Lebanon as a major political party.

Regional changes provided an opportunity for Lebanon, he said, noting that Syria's new government, which took power last year after the fall of Iranian ally Bashar al-Assad, was now opening dialogue with Israel.

“The dialogue has started between Syria and Israel, just as the dialogue needs to be reinvented by Lebanon,” he said. “If you don't want change, it's no problem. The rest of the region is moving at Mach speed and you will be left behind.”

So why don't they feel rich?","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/personal-finance/retirement/article-canadians-millionaires-feeling-rich-retirement-planning/","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Illustration by The Globe and Mail/Getty Images

Martin Alderwick is a millionaire. But he doesn't feel like one.

The 76-year-old retiree lives modestly in Guelph, Ont., with his wife. The couple bring in about $7,500 a month in retirement income and own a townhouse that makes up nearly 40 per cent of their total assets. Their net worth crosses the seven-figure threshold.

But Mr. Alderwick doesn't identify with the millionaire title. “I live comfortably,” he said. “But I still look for bargains and where I can save.”

His unease reflects a growing reality in Canada: A rising number of people technically qualify as millionaires, but don't feel, or function, like it.

According to the UBS 2025 Global Wealth Report, the number of so-called “everyday millionaires,” those with wealth between US$1-million and US$5-million, has quadrupled globally since 2000, reaching nearly 52 million people. 

In Canada, and around the world, much of that growth is tied to real estate, according to the UBS report. As home values surged in major cities and even mid-sized markets, many middle-class homeowners became millionaires without doing anything beyond staying put.

But with that wealth locked into their primary residences, many of these individuals are likely confronting an uncomfortable truth that having a million-dollar net worth doesn't necessarily mean you are financially ready for retirement.

“We still have this notion of a millionaire as someone on a yacht or a private jet,” said Brenda O'Connor Juanas, a financial adviser at UBS. “The makeup of what this millionaire looks like is quite different.”

In 2024, the average Canadian household net worth reached $1,026,205, a 30 per cent jump from 2019, according to Statistics Canada. Generation X has the greatest average real-estate wealth, at $666,146 per household, followed by baby boomers at $550,994 per household.

“The tension is that a lot of that net worth happens to be in things that they can't access on a day-to-day basis, mainly their home equity,” Ms. O'Connor Juanas, who is Canadian and living in the U.S., said. “You see a lot of net worth in terms of a paper number but not necessarily what an everyday millionaire Canadian would feel.”

Laid off with $2.5-million in savings, should Jake and Wanda retire permanently?

Opinion: The bitter truth is that cheaper housing means a retirement crisis for homeowners

For Mr. Alderwick, he sees his house as “somewhat irrelevant” when it comes to his current financial situation and living in the moment. “It may help my dependants or offspring, but it's no help to me. You can't live on that.”

Unlike pensions or RRSPs, a home doesn't generate monthly income in retirement. It doesn't pay for groceries or cover medical bills. And converting it into cash, whether through downsizing, borrowing or reverse mortgages, comes with financial and emotional trade-offs.

The disconnect becomes even more striking when compared to the amount of money Canadians say they think they need to comfortably retire.

According to Fidelity Canada's 2025 Retirement Report, pre-retirees believe they'll need about $1.02-million to retire comfortably, a figure that does not include home equity. That's more than double what Canadians thought they needed in 2005.

In other words, if your $1-million net worth includes a $900,000 house and just $100,000 in liquid savings, you're likely well short of the mark of what you may feel like you need in order to comfortably retire.

Do you need $1.54-million to retire, or is it $2.1-million?

Retire Rich: The family ties of a financial plan

Longer lives, rising costs and uncertainty about the future are some reasons why Canadians feel they need to save more to live a comfortable retirement, said Michelle Munro, director of tax and retirement research at Fidelity.

Although prices are not rising as fast as previous years, costs for key essentials, such as groceries and gas, still remain much higher than prepandemic levels.

“What we fail to acknowledge is that consumers like you and me don't necessarily care about the rate of change in inflation. They care about the change of price levels,” Ms. O'Connor Juanas said.

While $1-million may be enough for someone living in a lower-cost region, it's far from a magic, one-size-fits-all number, Ms. Munro said. For a person living in a high-cost city, such as Vancouver or Toronto, Ms. Munro finds that million figure “very limiting.”

That's why having a plan, not just a number, is key, Ms. Munro said. According to the Fidelity report, 90 per cent of Canadians with a written financial plan feel prepared for retirement, compared to just 55 per cent of those without one.

It's also important to diversify how you grow your nest egg, Ms. Munro said. While the sale of a home in retirement can be a way to fund long-term care, it's a good idea to also have assets that are more easily accessible. That can be done by having a portion of liquid assets in accounts such as a high-interest savings account for short-term goals. For long-term goals, investing in the stock market can offer growth over a longer period.

“When somebody has a goal that they're working towards saving, towards investing, they're really setting themselves up for success,” Ms. Munro said. 

For Ms. O'Connor Juanas, the takeaway is clear: “Many Canadians are paper millionaires, but that doesn't necessarily give them a lot of comfort that they'll be okay in retirement, which actually is an incentive to plan earlier.”

President Ramaphosa called the accusation against his police minister a ""grave national security concern"" after a top cop alleged interference in a political assassination probe.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa's focus at the BRICS summit in Brazil was jolted back home Sunday after a top police officer made allegations implicating the country's police minister.

Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi accused Police Minister Senzo Mchunu and other senior officials of interfering in investigations into political assassinations to shield politically connected people.

Mkhwanazi, who oversees police operations in KwaZulu-Natal province and previously served as acting national police commissioner, also accused other officials of obstructing police work against organized crime.

Mchunu has denied the allegations as ""insinuations made without evidence or due processes,"" the AFP news agency reported.

Ramaphosa described the matter as one of ""grave national security concern"" and said it was ""receiving the highest priority attention.""

""It is vital that the integrity of the country's security services is safeguarded and that the rule of law is affirmed,"" the president said in a statement late Sunday.

Politicians across the political spectrum have called on the president to take action.

The Democratic Alliance (DA), the second-largest party in Ramaphosa's governing coalition, has called for an urgent debate in Parliament on corruption in the South African Police Service (SAPS).

""Our country will never win against violent crime, and our streets will never be safe, until the SAPS has robust integrity management inside and out,"" said the DA's Ian Cameron, who also chairs Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Police.

Another lawmaker on the committee, David Skosana of the uMkhonto weSizwe party, urged Mkhwanazi to lay charges against Mchunu within 24 hours.

The Economic Freedom Fighters called for the immediate suspension of Mchunu and Deputy National Police Commissioner for Crime Detection Lt. Gen. Shadrack Sibiya, who has also been implicated.

The Inkatha Freedom Party, whose deputy chief whip in Parliament, Khethamabala Sithole, was shot dead in what appeared to be a political killing in May, wants the president to appoint an independent commission of inquiry.

""The collective integrity of the SAPS has been alleged to be wholly compromised, and the country has every reason to be worried,"" the party said.

South Africa has one of the highest crime rates in the world.

A report released last year by the Switzerland-based Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime documented a 108% increase in targeted killings, particularly political killings at the local municipal level, over the past decade.

In 2018, SAPS formed a task team to focus on political killings. The team has investigated more than 600 cases, arrested 436 suspects, and recovered 156 firearms, at least 55 of which were linked to political crimes, according to the Daily Maverick, a local media outlet.

At the end of last year, Mchunu requested that the unit be disbanded. When that did not happen, the unit's dockets containing information on political killings were seized, effectively freezing investigations.

Mkhwanazi said Mchunu shut down the task team because it had uncovered links between drug cartels, politicians, police, and prosecutors, the Mail&Guardian newspaper reported.

""All these statements made by him in public require an urgent, thorough and transparent investigation, on a proper platform,"" Mchunu said.

A German startup is looking into how communications were lost with a memorial spaceflight capsule on its return to Earth. The Nyx craft was due to return ashes to bereaved families after the extraterrestrial trip.

Bavaria-based startup The Exploration Company (TEC) says it is investigating the loss of a space capsule that was carrying the ashes of 166 people back to their families.

The ""Nyx Mission Possible"" craft had been due to return the ashes to Earth — and the bereaved — after orbiting the planet twice in late June. However, an anomaly occurred and the capsule was lost during its planned re-entry.

In a statement posted on professional networking site LinkedIn, TEC said it had re-established communication with the capsule upon reentry — after a standard blackout because of the heat — before losing it again.

""From an orbital altitude of 550 kilometers [about 340 miles], the capsule re-entered successfully in a controlled manner, with communication established post maximum heat. Communications were, however, lost at 26 km altitude, just before the transonic phase preceding the opening of the parachutes.""

""To better understand the outcomes, we have established an independent investigation team. Their findings will be shared with our clients, investors, and internal teams.""

In an earlier statement, TEC apologized ""to all our clients who entrusted us with their payloads.""

Charles Chafer, co-founder and CEO of the Texas-based ""memorial spaceflight"" company Celestis, who hired TEC, said it was the first time that such a reentry had been attempted.

""As a result of this unforeseen event, we believe that we will not be able to recover or return the flight capsules aboard. We share in the disappointment of our families, and we offer our sincerest gratitude for their trust.""

""Though we currently believe that we cannot return the flight capsules, we hope families will find some peace in knowing their loved ones were part of a historic journey, launched into space, orbited Earth, and are now resting in the vastness of the Pacific, akin to a traditional and honored sea scattering.""

As well as the human remains, the Nyx capsule had been carrying cannabis plant material and seeds for a citizen science project to study the viability of growing cannabis on Mars.

In 2024, Celestis sent the remains of several people connected with the cult series ""Star Trek"" on a final journey into space, including the series' creator, Gene Roddenberry and his wife, Majel Barret Roddenberry, who was one of the actors.

Protecting donkeys helps protect the people who depend on them to survive the ongoing crisis, says a Gaza veterinarian.

Israel's genocide in Gaza has transformed donkeys from an outdated mode of transportation — once seen mostly in impoverished or agricultural areas — into the only remaining means of transportation for many. With most vehicles destroyed and fuel prices soaring, people have been left with no choice but to rely on donkeys to access basic services and transport their belongings when Israeli forces issue new evacuation orders.

Ranya Hammoda, 44, said she was initially embarrassed to ride in a donkey cart, but it has now become part of her daily routine. “I have asthma, and I can't walk long distances because I start to feel short of breath and my chest tightens,” she said. “The donkeys have made it easier for me to get my necessities and visit the clinic which is three kilometers away from my area for my asthma medication.”

Yaser Alyazori, 48, described donkeys as lifesavers. “Each time we receive an evacuation order, I rely on a donkey cart to transport my family and the essential items we desperately need — food, water gallons, clothes, and blankets,” he said. “It's incredibly difficult to walk for long distances under heavy bombardment while carrying heavy loads and caring for my children. Without donkeys, I can't even imagine what our lives would be like.”

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

The use of donkeys in Gaza has expanded to cover nearly every aspect of our lives. They have become makeshift ambulances, transporting the injured, the dead, and even pregnant women to hospitals — especially in areas so severely destroyed that ambulance vehicles cannot pass through bombed and rubble-filled streets. Their ability to navigate these devastated zones has helped save precious time and countless lives.

Yasen Nassar, 20, said that during the Israeli invasion of the al-Shujayya neighborhood in December 2023, he used his donkey cart to carry dozens of injured people to the hospital. He explained that artillery shelling targeted a school used as a shelter for displaced families, resulting in many deaths and injuries. “People repeatedly called for ambulances, but they kept saying they couldn't reach the area. Every passing minute meant losing lives,” he said. “We could not wait any longer. I carried the injured in my donkey cart and rushed them to the hospital, where they received medical care, and some of them survived.”

In addition to their role in emergencies, donkey carts became vital in clearing debris from homes and streets. They also assist in transporting goods and produce still grown in Gaza's remaining agricultural lands, carrying them from the south to the north — and vice versa — to reach markets and families in need across the Strip.

However, the intense demands and the harsh conditions of working in a war zone have taken a heavy toll on these animals. They work more than nine hours a day, walking through rubble-filled and destroyed streets while carrying loads that can weigh up to a ton. In addition, the severe shortage of proper fodder and veterinary medicine has left these donkeys emaciated and sick.

Mohamed Ali, a 24-year-old veterinarian, explained that donkeys require proper nutrition to carry out their work effectively. Their diet should contain protein and ingredients such as barley, bran, yellow corn, and compressed fodder rich in minerals and vitamins. However, the Israeli blockade has blocked the entry of these essential supplies into Gaza. As a result, donkey owners now struggle to feed their animals and are forced to rely on poor substitutes like rotten bread, expired flour, and lentils.

Ali added that this type of food harms the donkeys' health, causing weight loss and leaving them weak and frail. It also leads to muscle tissue wasting and prevents the donkey from working for long hours. In addition, this food is difficult for the donkeys to digest, resulting in intestinal distress, bloating, and pressure on the diaphragm, along with gas buildup in the bladder — issues that can ultimately lead to the donkey's death.

Ali explained that donkeys typically receive vaccinations and antibiotics such as Ivomec to protect them from intestinal worms and skin diseases like mange. However, none of these medications are currently available. He added that one of the most common skin conditions now affecting donkeys is caused by flies, mosquitoes, and the heavily polluted environment. Constant biting forces the animals to scratch themselves against any hard surface to relieve the irritation, leading to skin damage, hair loss, and the development of black patches.

Ali noted that this condition requires specialized ointments and medications, but due to the blockade, they are no longer accessible. As a result, donkey owners have been forced to resort to primitive methods, such as rubbing the donkey's body with kerosene to repel flies or covering it with cloth for protection.

In addition, Ali mentioned that most of the donkeys in Gaza are suffering from wounds and injuries, either due to the war or from being beaten with sticks and plastic pipes. He added that the lack of antibiotics, disinfectants, and iodine — along with poor nutrition — prevents the wounds from healing, often leading to infections, wound decay, and tissue damage.

“If this situation continues, more and more donkeys will die, adding to many that have already perished because of the Israeli war,” said Ali. “The conditions they endure are unbearable. They work for hours under harsh circumstances and receive nothing in return — no proper food, no veterinary care. These animals have become the last lifeline for people in Gaza. They ease our suffering and help us access essential services. Protecting them is, in fact, protecting the people who depend on them to survive amid this ongoing crisis.”

The war between Russia and Ukraine began with an unprovoked combined air and ground assault, then settled into a mid-twentieth-century-style artillery standoff, and has now evolved into the world's first conflict waged largely by drones.Last year, Ukraine launched a series of successful long-range drone strikes against ammunition depots hundreds of miles inside Russian territory. Such strikes have been ongoing ever since. Every day, the Ukrainian military deploys thousands of shorter-range drones to defend against Russian ground assaults, largely replacing the Howitzer shells that were previously the lifeblood of the conflict. Kyiv is locked in a technological and production arms race to ensure that its drones are both sophisticated enough and plentiful enough to overcome Russian jamming and other countermeasures. Ukraine's innovators are still reaching new heights: in June, Ukrainian drones caused billions of dollars in damage to advanced military aircraft in remote parts of Russia.The United States has played an important role in this Ukrainian success, seeding the expansion in this key area of the country's defense industrial base and financing the most promising Ukrainian drone manufacturers, to help Ukraine reach a level of production once unimaginable—millions of autonomous systems per year. Today, the remarkable pace of this innovation, forged by necessity under battlefield conditions found nowhere else on the planet, presents an opportunity for the United States. To seize it, the Department of Defense and U.S. industry must learn from Ukraine's drones and other defense technology. The war between Russia and Ukraine is not perfectly analogous to contingencies that the United States may face in the future, and not every lesson in Ukraine is applicable to U.S. military planning, but this war is nonetheless full of instructive technological innovations and breakthroughs. Over the past three and a half years, Ukraine has developed a cutting-edge defense industry. The Ukrainian military still depends on the United States for high-end conventional capabilities such as Patriot air defense missiles, as well as certain staples, including rockets and associated launchers. But within its own borders, Ukraine is now producing novel and inexpensive short- and long-range drones, counterdrone systems, robotics, and tactical air defenses. While serving in the Biden administration, we toured Ukraine's drone facilities, met with their manufacturers, and watched Ukrainian businesses, frontline forces, and pilots work together to upgrade those systems, hour by hour, in response to battlefield feedback. Having never experienced this form of combat, most countries in the world, including the United States, are now far behind the Ukrainians in this regard. Neither the U.S. military nor any European military can produce mass quantities of such low-cost and adaptable capabilities. Nor is it clear that the U.S. military is moving rapidly enough to incorporate battlefield lessons into its own doctrine. Meanwhile, Ukraine and Russia are innovating further as they gradually integrate AI into their drone and other defense technologies. AI promises to remake modern warfare, just as it will remake so many other aspects of society—but unlike with large language models, Kyiv, not San Francisco, is where cutting-edge systems are being developed and deployed first.This opportunity to learn from Ukraine provides, among other things, a powerful counterargument to those who question the merits of continuing to support Ukraine: the United States can benefit from Ukraine's unique technological capabilities and knowledge of U.S. adversaries. President Donald Trump's recent decision to pause critical security assistance deliveries to Ukraine should be reversed for many reasons, including because a sustained pause will make it more challenging to deepen U.S.-Ukrainian technological cooperation.

To its credit, the Trump administration has said it is committed to defense innovation. Ukraine is perhaps the leading laboratory for such innovation today. Russia's key backers—China, Iran, and North Korea—are surely drawing their own lessons from this war, and from their contributions to Russia's military campaign. Iran is learning how its drones and missiles perform; North Korea is doing the same with its munitions and soldiers; and China is assessing the efficacy of its inputs into Russia's defense industrial base. To stay ahead and enhance its readiness for potential conflicts in the Indo-Pacific, the Middle East, and elsewhere, the United States must expand its technological partnership with Ukraine. That means continuing Washington's support for Ukraine's military, with the understanding that Ukraine will, in turn, share its technological know-how and expertise, including the designs for its most effective drones, its strategy for upgrading those designs in response to Russian countermeasures, and data on the strengths and weaknesses of Russia's defensive and offensive weapons systems. This approach would be mutually beneficial: Ukraine would help the United States build world-class drones and other cutting-edge capabilities, and the United States would continue to help Ukraine defend itself. But the inverse is also true—less support for Ukraine will mean it will be less inclined to share its expertise and data with the United States.

Ukraine developed its drone industry as part of a national struggle to survive. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, the Ukrainian military repelled the Russian assault on Kyiv and went on to retake more than half the territory that Russian forces initially seized. At the same time, in factories and labs far from the frontlines, Ukrainian entrepreneurs and engineers began to pursue another critical mission: to build drones that could be deployed against Russian forces.These innovators had the same fervor as their countrymen on the battlefield, but they needed financing and materiel. The U.S. government quietly provided this assistance. In the fall of 2022, the Biden administration began efforts to improve Ukraine's drone manufacturing, which at that time was nascent. A turning point came in the summer of 2023, when Ukraine's counteroffensive failed to break through Russian lines and exposed the limitations of conventional capabilities in this conflict. Ukraine's brigades were unable to overcome Russia's rudimentary but effective minefields and other physical barriers, while Russian drones wreaked havoc on Ukraine's armored vehicles. In response, the United States decided to turbocharge support for Ukraine's drone industry. The White House worked with Congress to secure additional funding in the April 2024 national security supplemental for this effort, which was used both to finance select Ukrainian drone manufacturers directly and to provide Ukraine with key components needed for drone production. In all, as we briefed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a visit to Kyiv last fall, the United States directed more than $1.5 billion into Ukraine's drone industry, and other countries followed suit in supporting Ukraine's defense industrial base. Ukrainian partners generated an enormous return on this investment: Ukrainian production of both short- and long-range drones increased exponentially in 2024. According to the Ukrainian government, the Ukrainian military's monthly supply of drones rose from 20,000 at the start of 2024 to 200,000 a year later, a tenfold increase. As Russia improved its counterdrone capabilities, Ukrainian manufacturers learned to update their software and designs to defeat Russian jamming and other countermeasures. By January 2025, Ukraine had scaled its ability to use long-range drones against military targets deep inside Russia and to use shorter-range drones against Russian units across the frontlines. Ukraine was also producing impressive counterdrone, missile, robotic, and tactical air defense systems. 

The opportunity to learn from Ukraine's cutting-edge capabilities still exists today, although the window is closing. Ukraine's drones have proved both effective and affordable. Ukraine is building millions of short-range FPV drones this year at a cost of roughly $400 per unit and tens of thousands of long-range drones at a cost of roughly $200,000 per unit. By contrast, shorter-range U.S. drones such as the Switchblade 600 are estimated to cost more than $100,000 per unit, and longer-range U.S. drones can cost millions. Ukrainian drone operators report that U.S.-made drones have been less effective, reliable, and rapidly adaptable to Russian countermeasures than those produced inside Ukraine.These differences are in part a matter of circumstance. Ukraine is fighting for its survival with limited resources against a larger adversary, while the Pentagon has historically been cautious about investing in emerging technologies and startups, preferring instead to partner with established contractors on legacy systems. Part of the problem is that these contractors have incentives to build more limited numbers of expensive, higher-margin weapons. But the Ukraine conflict has also addressed a legitimate concern for the Pentagon—uncertainty about which technologies will prove effective in the real world—by providing billions of dollars in R & D and weapons testing under unprecedented battlefield conditions. Although there will remain a role for more advanced and expensive autonomous systems in which the United States retains an edge, the sheer scale of Ukraine's mass production yields an important and complementary advantage. Ukraine can iterate rapidly—and discard older models with such frequency—precisely because companies are closer to the action and its systems are cheap and disposable. As Ukraine and Russia deploy AI-enabled drone technology, China, Iran, and North Korea will be watching, and learning. As AI-driven swarming technology develops, the advantage of sheer numbers will only deepen. U.S. allies and partners threatened by stronger adversaries are particularly in need of the kinds of asymmetric capabilities Ukraine is developing. Consider Taiwan, which could use scalable and cheap drones to help defend itself if Beijing were to escalate. Washington should provide such partners with similar capabilities and help them develop their own domestic production. But for the United States, this opportunity is about more than just helping friends. Ukraine's offensive success against Russia, such as the recent drone attack conducted from trucks positioned deep inside Russian territory, reveals potential shortcomings in U.S. defenses, as well, including in the homeland. Ukrainian expertise could help close the gap.

Learning the right lessons from Ukraine to strengthen U.S. capabilities should involve a few key steps. As a starting point, the U.S. Defense Department should work with Ukrainian companies to manufacture drones in the United States, with the understanding that those drones would then be provided to both the Ukrainian and the U.S. militaries. This type of partnership, known as coproduction, would be a win-win: the United States would learn from Ukrainian manufacturers firsthand, and both Ukraine and the United States would receive these drones. The Pentagon should also strike a deal with the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense to license drone technology and designs to the United States. With this intellectual property, the U.S. military could independently build inexpensive and battlefield-tested drones and develop the domestic infrastructure needed to scale production.The United States could take the same approach with additional Ukrainian technologies, including counterdrone systems, by coproducing these capabilities with Ukraine and acquiring the associated intellectual property. Ukraine's defense industry has succeeded in part because its manufacturers can engage in rapid iteration based on real-world results. The United States should also take advantage of the opportunity to provide Ukraine with experimental U.S. technologies, assess their performance on the ground, and then make updates accordingly. The primary risk of this approach is that the United States could become dependent on a foreign partner for some of its defense production, akin to Russian dependency on Iranian drones in the current conflict. But the alternative is worse given Ukraine's current knowledge and production advantage, and the focus should be on closing this gap. The United States should view its collaboration with Ukraine as a short-term technology accelerator rather than a long-term solution. The Department of Defense, working with U.S. industry, should aim to learn from Ukrainian expertise rapidly, begin to produce these cutting-edge systems, and then transition away from licensed models and toward their own independent designs. Should the United States instead back away from supporting Ukraine, it would risk losing access to proven defense technology, battlefield expertise, and data on Russia's military performance. Europe, meanwhile, should look to the United States and Ukraine as complementary models for defense production. As European leaders invest in their own defense industries, the United States can offer guidance on how to build higher-end autonomous systems, as well as conventional capabilities such as artillery, rockets, and strategic air defense at scale. Ukraine can do the same for mass-produced drones and associated technologies. Ukraine's fight represents a watershed in modern warfare. Kyiv has shown that it is possible to hold a stronger adversary at bay with advanced, affordable, and adaptable drones and other defense technologies. The United States must continue to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression, and as the Trump administration seeks more in return, Ukraine should help the United States turbocharge its own innovation. Both countries will be better and stronger for it.

 Yasmin Green and Gillian Tett

When experts worry about young people's relationship with information online, they typically assume that young people are not as media literate as their elders. But ethnographic research conducted by Jigsaw—Google's technology incubator—reveals a more complex and subtle reality: members of Gen Z, typically understood to be people born after 1997 and before 2012, have developed distinctly different strategies for evaluating information online, ones that would bewilder anyone over 30. They do not consume news as their elders would—namely, by first reading a headline and then the story. They do typically read the headlines first, but then they jump to the online comments associated with the article, and only afterward delve into the body of the news story. That peculiar tendency is revealing. Young people do not trust that a story is credible simply because an expert, editorial gatekeeper, or other authority figure endorses it; they prefer to consult a crowd of peers to assess its trustworthiness. Even as young people mistrust institutions and figures of authority, the era of the social web allows them to repose their trust in the anonymous crowd.

A subsequent Jigsaw study in the summer of 2023, following the release of the artificial intelligence program ChatGPT, explored how members of Gen Z in India and the United States use AI chatbots. The study found that young people were quick to consult the chatbots for medical advice, relationship counseling, and stock tips, since they thought that AI was easy to access, would not judge them, and was responsive to their personal needs—and that, in many of these respects, AI advice was better than advice they received from humans. In another study, the consulting firm Oliver Wyman found a similar pattern: as many as 39 percent of Gen Z employees around the world would prefer to have an AI colleague or manager instead of a human one; for Gen Z workers in the United States, that figure is 36 percent. A quarter of all employees in the United States feel the same way, suggesting that these attitudes are not only the province of the young.

Such findings challenge conventional notions about the importance and sanctity of interpersonal interactions. Many older observers lament the rise of chatbots, seeing the new technology as guilty of atomizing people and alienating them from larger society, encouraging a growing distance between individuals and a loss of respect for authority. But seen another way, the behavior and preferences of Gen Z also point to something else: a reconfiguration of trust that carries some seeds of hope.

Analysts are thinking about trust incorrectly. The prevailing view holds that trust in societal institutions is crumbling in Western countries today, a mere two percent of Americans say they trust Congress, for example, compared with 77 percent six decades ago; although 55 percent of Americans trusted the media in 1999, only 32 percent do so today. Indeed, earlier this year, the pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson concluded that “what unites us [Americans], increasingly, is what we distrust.”

But such data tells only half the tale. The picture does seem dire if viewed through the twentieth-century lens of traditional polling that asks people how they feel about institutions and authority figures. But look through an anthropological or ethnographic lens—tracking what people do rather than what they simply tell pollsters—and a very different picture emerges. Trust is not necessarily disappearing in the modern world; it's migrating. With each new technological innovation, people are turning away from traditional structures of authority and toward the crowd, the amorphous but very real world of people and information just a few taps away.

This shift poses dangers that nobody should minimize. The risks of overdependence and reality distortion from AI companions are already evident: studies show that their intensive use is associated with decreased well-being and emotional dependency in socially isolated users. But the shift could also deliver benefits. Although people who are not digital natives might consider it risky to trust a bot, the fact is that many in Gen Z seem to think that it is as risky (if not riskier) to trust human authority figures. If AI tools are designed carefully, they might potentially help—not harm—interpersonal interactions: they can serve as mediators, helping polarized groups communicate better with one another; they can potentially counter conspiracy theories more effectively than human authority figures; they can also provide a sense of agency to people who are suspicious of human experts. The challenge for policymakers, citizens, and tech companies alike is to recognize how the nature of trust is evolving and then design AI tools and policies in response to this transformation. Younger generations will not act like their elders, and it is unwise to ignore the tremendous change they are ushering in.

Trust is a basic human need: it glues people and groups together and is the foundation for democracy, markets, and most aspects of social life today. It operates in several forms. The first and simplest type of trust is that between individuals, the face-to-face knowledge that often binds small groups together through direct personal links. Call this “eye-contact trust.” It is found in most nonindustrialized settings (of the sort often studied by anthropologists) and also in the industrialized world (among groups of friends, colleagues, schoolmates, and family members).

When groups grow big, however, face-to-face interactions become insufficient. As Robin Dunbar, an evolutionary biologist, has noted, the number of people a human brain can genuinely know is limited; Dunbar reckoned the number was around 150. “Vertical trust” was the great innovation of the last few millennia, allowing larger societies to function through institutions such as governments, capital markets, the academy, and organized religion. These rules-based, collective, norm-enforcing, resource-allocating systems shape how and where people direct their trust.

The digitization of society over the past two decades has enabled a new paradigm shift beyond eye-contact and vertical trust to what the social scientist Rachel Botsman calls “distributed trust,” or large-scale, peer-to-peer interactions. That is because the Internet enables interactions between groups without eye contact. For the first time, complete strangers can coordinate with one another for travel through an app such as Airbnb, trade through eBay, entertain one another by playing multiplayer video games such as Fortnite, and even find love through sites such as Match.com.

To some, these connections might seem untrustworthy, since it is easy to create fake digital personas, and no single authority exists to impose and enforce rules online. But many people nevertheless act as if they do trust the crowd, partly because mechanisms have arisen that bolster trust, such as social media profiles, “friending,” crowd affirmation tools, and online peer reviews that provide some version of oversight. Consider the ride-sharing app Uber. Two decades ago, it would have seemed inconceivable to build a taxi service that encourages strangers to get into one another's private cars; people did not trust strangers in that way. But today, millions do that, not just because people trust Uber, as an institution, but because a peer-to-peer ratings system—the surveillance of the crowd—reassures both passengers and drivers. Over time and with the impetus of new technology, trust patterns can shift.

AI offers a new twist in this tale, one that could be understood as a novel form of trust. The technology has long been quietly embedded in daily lives, in tools such as spell checkers and spam filters. But the recent emergence of generative AI marks a distinct shift. AI systems now boast sophisticated reasoning and can act as agents, executing complex tasks autonomously. This sounds terrifying to some; indeed, an opinion poll from Pew suggests that only 24 percent of Americans think that AI will benefit them, and 43 percent expect to see it “harm” them.

But American attitudes toward AI are not universally shared. A 2024 Ipsos poll found that although around two-thirds of adults in Australia, Canada, India, the United Kingdom, and the United States agreed that AI “makes them nervous,” a mere 29 percent of Japanese adults shared that view, as did only around 40 percent of adults in Indonesia, Poland, and South Korea. And although only about a third of people in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States agreed that they were excited about AI, almost half of people in Japan and three-quarters in South Korea and Indonesia did.

Meanwhile, although people in Europe and North America tell pollsters that they fear AI, they constantly use it for complex tasks in their lives, such as getting directions with maps, identifying items while shopping, and fine-tuning writing. Convenience is one reason: getting hold of a human doctor can take a long time, but AI bots are always available. Customization is another. In earlier generations, consumers tended to accept “one size fits all” services. But in the twenty-first century, digitization has enabled people to make more personalized choices in the consumer world, whether with music, media, or food. AI bots respond to and encourage this growing desire for customization.

Another, more counterintuitive factor is privacy and neutrality. In recent years, there has been widespread concern in the West that AI tools will “steal” personal data or perform with bias. This may sometimes be justified. Ethnographic research suggests, however, that a cohort of users prefer AI tools precisely because they seem more “neutral,” less controlling, and less intrusive than humans. One of the Gen Zers interviewed by Jigsaw explained her affinity for talking to AI in blunt terms: “The chatbot can't ‘cancel' me!”

Another recent study of people who believe conspiracy theories found that they were far more willing to discuss their beliefs with a bot than with family members or traditional authority figures, even when the bots challenged their ideas, which suggests one way that human-machine interactions can trump eye-contact and vertical trust mechanisms. As one person told the researchers: “Now this is the very first time I have gotten a response that made real, logical, sense.” For people who feel marginalized, powerless, or cut off from the elite—like much of Gen Z—bots seem less judgmental than humans and thus give their users more agency. Perhaps perversely, that makes them easier to trust.

This pattern might yet shift again, given the speed of technological change and the rise of “agentic intelligence,” the more sophisticated and autonomous successor to today's generative AI tools. The major AI developers, including Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI, are all advancing toward new “universal assistants” capable of seeing, hearing, chatting, reasoning, remembering, and taking action across devices. This means that AI tools will be able to make complex decisions without direct human supervision, which will allow them to bolster customer support (with chatbots that can meet customer needs) and coding (with agents who can help engineers with software development tasks).

New generations of AI tools are also gaining stronger persuasive capabilities, and in some contexts they seem to be as persuasive as humans. This invites obvious dangers if these tools are deliberately created and used to manipulate people—or if they simply misfire or hallucinate. Nobody should downplay those risks. Thoughtful design, however, can potentially mitigate this: for example, researchers at Google have shown that it is possible to develop tools and prompts that train the AI to identify and avoid manipulative language. And as with existing apps and digital tools, agentic AI allows users to exercise control. Consider wearable technology, such as a Fitbit or an Apple Watch, that can monitor vital signs, detect concerning patterns, recommend behavioral changes, and even alert health-care providers if necessary. In all these cases, it is the user, not the bot, who decides whether to respond to such prompts and which data will be used in the AI programs; your Fitbit cannot force you to go jogging. So, too, with financial planning bots or those used for dating: technology is not acting like a dictator but like a member of an online crowd of friends, offering tips that can be rejected or accepted.

Having an AI tool act in this way can obviously make people more efficient and also help them better organize their lives. But what is less evident is that these tools can potentially also improve peer-to-peer interaction within and between groups. As trust in authority figures has faded and people have tried to customize their information sources and online “crowd” to their individual tastes, societies have become more polarized, trapped in echo chambers that do not interact or understand each other. Human authority figures cannot easily remedy that, given widespread distrust. But just as AI tools can translate between languages, they are also starting to have the potential to translate between “social languages”: that is, between worldviews. A bot can scan online conversations between different groups and find patterns and points of common interest that can be turned into prompts that potentially enable one “crowd” of people to “hear” and even “understand” others' worldviews better. For instance, researchers from Google DeepMind and the University of Oxford have developed an AI tool called the “Habermas Machine” (an homage to the German philosopher Jürgen Habermas) that aspires to mediate disputes between groups with opposing political perspectives. It generates statements that reflect both the majority and the minority viewpoints in a group that relate to a political issue and then proposes areas of common ground. In studies involving over 5,000 participants, the AI-generated statements were preferred over those created by human mediators, and using them led to greater agreement about paths forward on divisive issues.



So how can societies reap the benefits of AI without falling prey to its dangers? First, they need to recognize that trust is a multifaceted phenomenon that has shifted before (and will keep shifting) and that technological change is occurring amid (and exacerbating) social flux. That means AI developers need to proceed very cautiously and humbly, discussing and mitigating the risks of the tools they develop. Google, for its part, has tried to do this by publishing an ambitious 300-page collection of recommendations about the ethical labyrinth of advanced AI assistants, exploring how to maintain safeguards that prevent AI from emotionally manipulating users, and what it means to measure human well-being. Other firms, such as Anthropic, are doing the same. But much more attention from the private sector is needed to tackle these uncertainties.

Consumers also need real choice among developers, so that they can select the platforms that offer the most privacy, transparency, and user control. Governments can encourage this by using public policy to promote responsible AI development, as well as open science and open software. This approach can create some safety risks. But it also creates more checks and balances by injecting competition between different systems. Just as customers can “shop around” for banks or telecom services if they dislike how one system treats them, they should be able to switch between AI agents to determine which platform offers them the most control.

Increasing human agency should be the goal when thinking about how people interact with AI platforms. Instead of viewing AI as a despotic, robotic overlord, developers need to present it more as a superintelligent member of people's existing online crowds. That does not mean people place blind faith in AI or use it to displace human-to-human interactions; that would be disastrous. But it would be equally foolish to reject AI simply because it seems alien. AI, like humans, has the potential to do good and bad and to act in trustworthy and untrustworthy ways. If we want to unlock the full benefits of AI, we need to recognize that we live in a world where trust in leaders is crumbling, even as we put more faith in the wisdom of crowds—and ourselves. The challenge, then, is to use this digital boost to the wisdom of crowds to make us all wiser.

            The Department of Homeland Security has moved to terminate a form of humanitarian relief for migrants from Nicaragua and Honduras residing in the United States, according to an announcement from the department and draft notices published in the Federal Register.
    


            The Trump administration has stripped protections from multiple nationalities in the US who were protected from deportation and allowed to temporarily live in the country, arguing that conditions at home no longer justified those protections. The termination of the relief, known as Temporary Protected Status, has prompted legal challenges nationwide — and has been blocked by federal judges in some instances.
    


            The latest move would affect approximately 72,000 migrants from Honduras and 4,000 from Nicaragua, according to government estimates.
    


            Honduras was initially designated for TPS in 1999 based on an environmental disaster, according to a draft notice in the Federal Register. Nicaragua was similarly designated for TPS in 1999 because of an environmental disaster.
    


            “Temporary Protected Status was designed to be just that — temporary,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. “It is clear that the Government of Honduras has taken all of the necessary steps to overcome the impacts of Hurricane Mitch, almost 27 years ago.”
    


            TPS applies to people who would face extreme hardship if forced to return to homelands devastated by armed conflict or natural disasters, therefore the protections are limited to people already in the United States. Past Republican and Democratic administrations have designated the protections, though some Republicans have argued the relief shouldn't have been extended multiple times.

    Editor's Note: Brett McGurk is a CNN global affairs analyst who served in senior national security positions under Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden.



            Two weeks after America's unprecedented military strikes into Iran, the situation in the Middle East has stabilized and focus is turning to diplomacy.
    


            So, what's on the global agenda? Over the coming weeks, I'd concentrate on a few areas.
    


            Prime Minister Netanyahu visits Washington early this week, and his top aides have been in town for days preparing. Top of mind is Gaza, where a ceasefire could be closer than it's been in months.
    


            The situation in Gaza is horrific. This is a war that must end, and end soon. But ending a war is far harder than starting one — a lesson Hamas has learned. Israel also has failed to define a future for Gaza without Hamas, still its core demand in ongoing talks.
    


            It is impossible to responsibly answer how this war ends without fully grappling with October 7, 2023, and Hamas' decision to invade Israel, slaughter 1,200 innocent people, and take more than 250 hostages (living and dead) back to its tunnels in Gaza.

            Since then, Hamas has had one consistent demand in exchange for the release of the hostages: Israel must guarantee a “permanent ceasefire” against Hamas while the group still controls Gaza and rearms, effectively returning to the status quo before the attack. Israel has rejected that demand, and in return, demands that a permanent ceasefire means Hamas must relinquish control of Gaza for good.
    


            That is the intractable crux, and it's remained so during nearly two years of this terrible war.
    


            In the Biden administration, I helped lead talks with Israel and Hamas on a ceasefire and hostage release deal. Unable to resolve this fundamental gap in positions, we developed a phased process whereby Hamas would release the most vulnerable hostages — children, women, elderly and wounded — in exchange for temporary ceasefires and the release by Israel of an agreed set of Palestinian prisoners.
    


            The ceasefire would continue so long as talks were ongoing in good faith over post-conflict arrangements in Gaza.
    


            These phased deals have resulted in the release of nearly 150 living hostages from Gaza. There are now believed to be 20 live hostages left there. This past January, after months of painstaking talks and after Hamas' ally Hezbollah in Lebanon had cut its own deal and left Hamas isolated, both Hamas and Israel agreed to a three-stage roadmap to end the war for good.
    

More than 80 Palestinians were killed in Gaza on Thursday, according to health officials, as Israel intensified its strikes, hitting a school-turned-displacement facility. CNN's Paula Hancocks looks at the damage and humanitarian toll.

            That deal had earlier been endorsed by the UN Security Council, and it required that “conditions” be set for a permanent end to the war in later stages. That was understood to mean Hamas would need to relinquish its authority to allow Gaza to be rehabilitated with international support, as few are likely to support the reconstruction of Gaza with Hamas still in control.
    


            Unfortunately, Hamas used the promising ceasefire earlier this year to come out of its tunnels in a show of force. After six weeks of calm without a shot fired, during which more than 10,000 trucks of humanitarian aid reached those in desperate need, the ceasefire broke down after its first 42-day phase.
    


            The war has since escalated, even as efforts to secure the release of hostages through a deal have continued.
    


            Today, there is new momentum toward a deal, structured along the same lines as the Biden framework. Under this proposal, Hamas would release 10 living hostages in exchange for a 60-day ceasefire and parallel release of Palestinian prisoners. If talks are ongoing at the end of that period for the final set of hostages, as well as conditions necessary for a final settlement, the ceasefire would continue.
    


            On July 1, Trump announced that Israel accepted this proposal. Hamas spent the week studying it, while also coming under tremendous pressure from Egypt and Qatar to give an unqualified yes. On July 4, Hamas gave its response, which appears to be a “yes, but,” with an offer of further talks to clarify where Israeli forces will deploy during the 60-day ceasefire, the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released in the deal, and modes of humanitarian aid delivery.

            Unfortunately, this means a war that could have stopped last week will now continue as Hamas' remaining leaders — living either underground in Gaza or in comfort outside of it — insist on haggling over details as the people they purport to represent live in the most horrific conditions imaginable.
    


            Talks over these final details are now set to resume this week in Doha, Qatar. We should all hope these talks succeed, because they offer the only way to free the remaining hostages and to end the war in Gaza anytime soon.
    


            In fact, unlike the January deal, where the ceasefire broke down after a first phase, now conditions are set to continue the ceasefire after 60 days and perhaps end the war for good.
    


            That is because most of Hamas' militant leaders are dead, and Israel is in a remarkably strong position following its successful military operation in Iran last month.
    


            This allows Israel to wind down the war from a position of strength and with no serious risk of another October 7. Trump will no doubt press Netanyahu to make reasonable compromises, while also pushing the emir of Qatar to deliver Hamas, which as of right now — and consistently throughout this conflict — is the main obstacle to a deal that will stop the war.
    


            Even as the assessments are ongoing about the extent of damage to Iran's nuclear program, a long-term solution will demand some form of a diplomatic arrangement.
    


            This is primarily for two reasons:
    


            First, as a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, or NPT, Iran has an obligation to account for and “safeguard” all its nuclear material. That includes the stockpiles of highly enriched uranium that may or may not be buried in the caverns of the bombed Fordow facility.
    


            While Iran's parliament has passed a law to sever ties with the International Atomic Energy Agency, its government has made clear it remains a member of the NPT and will continue to deal with the international agency through its Supreme Council for National Security, a rough equivalent to the National Security Council in the US.
    


            Should Iran refuse such cooperation, then France and the UK have authority to “snap back” all UN and international sanctions between now and October. That is something Iran's fledgling economy cannot afford.
    


            Second, if Iran wants to avoid the risk of further Israeli or American strikes, it will need to reach an agreement on whatever remains of its enrichment program. Before Israel's 12-day conflict with Iran, the US was prepared to accept enrichment by Tehran below 5% and aboveground pending the establishment of a regional fuel bank consortium where Iran would be a member with access to nuclear fuel for a civilian program, but unable to enrich entirely on its own.
    


            Iran did not accept that deal, and today the terms will surely be less favorable: no enrichment even for a temporary period or else face the risk of further strikes and international sanctions.

            Despite predictions that American strikes would render diplomacy impossible, Iran in fact is saying it's prepared to engage the American side once again, and I'd expect those talks to start soon.
    


            Given Iran's leadership losses, it may have a difficult time reaching decisions that will be necessary to forge an agreement of any kind. With the threat of the snapback procedure, however, which I've explained in this earlier essay, the table is being set for negotiations with a deadline later this year.
    


            The aim between now and then will be deal that permanently forecloses the possibility of Iran developing nuclear arms.
    


            Before October 7, 2023, the trend line in the Middle East was toward broader regional integration, economic cooperation and peace. In fact, on the day prior, an official Saudi delegation was in my office at the White House discussing parameters for an agreement to recognize Israel.
    


            That agreement promised to build on the Abraham Accords, and set the conditions for a longer-term regional peace, including between Israelis and Palestinians.
    


            The Palestinians (separate from Hamas and other terrorist groups) were part of this process and poised to reap significant gains from a Saudi pact. A senior Saudi official had just visited Ramallah, the administrative capital of the Palestinian Authority, for the first time since 1967. And on September 9, less than one month before October 7, the G20 nations endorsed an integrated trade, energy and technology ship-to-rail corridor known as IMEC — connecting India through the Gulf, Jordan, Israel (with future linkages into the West Bank), and from there into Europe.
    


            Hamas and its Iranian-backed allies derailed this promising agenda, but they did not reverse it. Ties between Israel and Abraham Accord countries such as the United Arab Emirates remain strong, and there is broad desire to return to an affirmative agenda once the war in Gaza subsides and a lasting ceasefire is in place. Israel's impressive military and intelligence successes make this trend more probable over time, as countries look to gain from its defense and technology sectors to further their own defense and economic growth.
    


            In a sign of how much has changed since October 7, and not in the manner Hamas and Iran intended, two new candidates for peace with Israel include Lebanon and Syria.
    


            Lebanon is formally in a state of war with Israel, but following Hezbollah's defeat last year, the country is setting a different trajectory. The new government in Beirut, led by the former Chief of Defense Joseph Aoun, aims to keep Hezbollah from re-arming and to finally resolving through negotiations demarcation of Lebanon's land border with Israel.
    


            That might pave the way toward diplomatic relations between the two countries, effectively ending a conflict that has lasted over 75 years.
    


            In Syria, the situation is more head-spinning.
    


            Last fall, after the defeat of Hezbollah and a US-mediated ceasefire in Lebanon, the long-standing Iranian ally Bashar al Assad fled to Moscow as his regime collapsed. The new president of Syria is Ahmed al-Sharaa, once the head of an extremist rebel group with ties to al Qaeda.
    


            I was the White House's Middle East lead when that happened, and pushed to engage with Sharaa, as our paramount interest was to give this new Syria a chance, albeit with our eyes wide open as to the risks

            Since then, Sharaa has said and, for the most part, done what is needed to return Syria into a broader regional fold without threatening any of its neighbors, including Israel. He has forged deals with the Kurdish-led forces in the northeast, embraced ties with Arab capitals, and assured the United States of his intentions enough to secure needed relief from crippling sanctions.
    


            Today, Israel is in backchannel talks with Syria, and there may be an opening for more formal talks leading to a possible nonaggression pact. No doubt, such an arrangement will be difficult given decades of mistrust, tensions between Israel and Turkey, and the need for Syria to compromise on Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.
    


            But even the possibility shows the new potential in the region. Whereas Syria and Lebanon were once the main corridors for Iranian arms and militias to reach and threaten Israel, now both countries are in talks with Israel to forge a border rational peace.
    


            For Israel, if it wishes to truly translate military success into lasting strategic gains, there is nothing more important than this regional agenda of integration, including with Saudi Arabia, which is still possible to achieve within Trump's second term.
    


            This will require a lasting ceasefire in Gaza and a political horizon on the Israeli-Palestinian issue, both of which will demand American diplomacy and facilitation with all parties.
    


            So, if there is one longer-term item on the agenda when Trump meets Netanyahu, it's this one.
    


            When Netanyahu visits the White House this week, there may be an inclination to score a victory lap following the combined US and Israeli operation last month in Iran. While an impressive feat of arms, declaring victory would be premature and without a focus on the agenda outlined above could even prove fleeting.
    


            Military success has set the stage for feats of diplomacy, and with creativity and compromise, it's now possible to see an end to the cataclysmic chain of events that Hamas unleashed on October 7.
    


            That should be the primary focus for both leaders this week.

            At least 10 people have died and 29 people have been injured in anti-government protests across Kenya on Monday, according to the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights.
    


            Kenyan police used tear gas and water cannon on protesters marking the 35th anniversary of a pro-democracy rally that has stirred anti-government resentment among Kenyan youths, who were already enraged over allegations of corruption, police brutality and abductions of government critics.
    


            The East African country has been hit by a wave of bloody protests that began last year over an unpopular finance bill that raised taxes amid a cost-of-living crisis.
    


            Kenya's government withdrew the tax bill in June last year in the wake of the demonstrations, but outrage has intensified over the recent death of a teacher in police custody and the shooting of an unarmed street vendor by police.
    


            At least 16 people were killed and hundreds injured during anti-government protests last month. Dozens more died during the anti-tax demonstrations in 2024.
    


            On Monday, several parts of Kenya saw gatherings as people marked the anniversary of the July 7, 1990, pro-democracy march known as Saba Saba. At least 37 people were arrested across 17 of Kenya's counties, according to the KNCHR.
    


            In the capital Nairobi, Kenyan security forces repelled protesters with tear gas and water cannon hours after blocking major roads leading into the city. Roads leading to the Kenyan Parliament building, as well as the president's office and residence, were also barricaded ahead of the demonstrations.
    


            There were reports on Monday afternoon of police opening fire on protesters. CNN has not confirmed the reports, but has reached out to Kenya's National Police Service for comment. Earlier in the day, police spokesperson Muchiri Nyaga told CNN he was unaware of any deaths.
    


            CNN affiliate Citizen TV reported that at least five people were shot dead in protests across the country, including two people who were shot dead in the Kangemi neighborhood of Nairobi. Another man was shot in the area and was “seen lying on the road” unconscious, it added.
    


            Video circulating on social media and geolocated by CNN shows a civilian in Kenya's Kiambu County stepping out of a car surrounded by armed officers, and then being whipped repeatedly by one of them. The civilian covers their head to protect themself, but does not appear to be threatening the officer in any way.
    


            In other parts of the country, some protesters have remained defiant despite the chaotic scenes.
    


            “We are not ready to go back (home) because who will fight for our rights then? We will be here till evening,” protester Francis Waswa told Reuters.
    


            The clampdown comes after individuals described by the Kenyan Human Rights Commission as “hired goons” who were “sent by the state to silence dissent” stormed the NGO's office.

            In a statement on Sunday night, the human rights body said those who entered the building “violently disrupted a press conference by Kenyan mothers calling for an end to arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings targeting protesters ahead of Saba Saba demonstrations.”
    


            Kenyan government spokesperson Isaac Mwaura told CNN to “contact the police spokesman” for comment when asked about the allegation.
    


            Police spokesman Nyaga said: “The National Police Service is looking into the incident and shall take appropriate steps after reviewing the unacceptable clip,” referring to CCTV footage shared by the NGO.
    


            Earlier on Sunday, Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen said security agencies were “on high alert to deal decisively with criminals and other elements of ill intent who may seek to infiltrate peaceful processions to cause havoc, mayhem, or destruction of property.”
    


            Murkomen previously described last month's demonstrations as “terrorism disguised as dissent,” in a statement that further reignited outrage.

            Mexico defeated the United States Men's National Team by a score of 2-1 on Sunday to win the nation's 10th CONCACAF Gold Cup trophy as champions of North America, Central America and the Caribbean.
    


            The match was the most important match for either team until next year's FIFA World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the two fierce rivals, along with Canada.
    


            The intensity of the occasion was evident from the opening kickoff in front of more than 70,000 screaming fans at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas.
    


            The Americans seemed to catch Mexico off guard as Chris Richards scored the game's first goal with a scintillating header that ricocheted in off the crossbar on a set piece free kick from Sebastian Berhalter just four minutes into the match to give the USA an instant advantage.
    


            Mexico took command after the USMNT's fast start and dominated for long stretches of a first half in which Mexico enjoyed nearly double the time of possession of the Americans.

            El Tri finally found its equalizer in the 27th minute when Raúl Jiménez turned on a pass from Marcel Ruíz and sent it past American goalie Matthew Freese and into the roof of the netting from point blank range to tie the game 1-1.
    


            After his heroics, Jiménez celebrated by mimicking the trademark celebration of recently deceased Portuguese star Diogo Jota, who was previously a teammate of Jiménez on the English professional team Wolverhampton Wanderers, while the Mexican striker held a Jota jersey across his lap.
    


            As the second half got underway, the two teams exchanged near goals in the early minutes as the momentum of the match teetered on a knife's edge.
    


            The tension continued to build until Mexico released the pressure with a set piece goal to break the deadlock in the 77th minute.
    


            The free kick deflected off the head of Johan Vásquez and a diving Edson Álvarez headed the ball into the corner of the USA goal to give El Tri a 2-1 lead.
    


            The goal was initially flagged as offside, but a Video Assistant Referee review determined that it was a good goal to put Mexico in front for the first time in the game.
    


            In the second minute of stoppage time, the USMNT came agonizingly close to tying the game, but Mexican keeper Ángel Malagón was able to do just enough to keep Patrick Agyemang's shot out of the goal, and the Mexico defense cleared the ball away.
    


            The Americans were unable to generate another good scoring opportunity before referee Mario Escobar blew the final whistle.
    


            Sunday night's game marked the eighth time that the two neighboring countries have met in the final of this tournament, with Mexico now holding the 6-2 advantage in those games.
    


            Mexico's second consecutive victory in the tournament extends its CONCACAF-leading tally to 10 Gold Cup crowns all-time, three more than the USMNT's second-place total of seven.
    


            For first-year USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino, there's less than a year until the 2026 World Cup, and the former Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea boss will be hoping that the return of some of the top US players will help his squad turn its fortunes.
    


            Christian Pulisic, arguably the best player in the team, drew the ire of Pochettino after he opted to sit out the Gold Cup to rest following a grueling season with Italian Serie A club AC Milan.
    


            Meanwhile, Weston McKennie and Tim Weah both missed the Gold Cup while playing in the Club World Cup with Juventus, while PSV defender Sergiño Dest pulled out of the squad to focus on fully recovering from an ACL injury.
    


            The USMNT will launch its World Cup campaign on June 12 at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, while Mexico will play in the first match of the tournament a day earlier at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Fifteen police officers have been taken into custody and are being investigated for their alleged role in the abductions and feared killings of at least 34 cockfighters, the Philippine police chief said Monday.

The missing people were accused of cheating in the hugely popular sport, with their bodies reportedly dumped in a scenic lake with a restive volcano.

The victims went missing around 2021 and 2022 mostly while on their way to or from cockfighting arenas dotting the main northern Philippine region of Luzon, including in the metropolitan Manila capital region. 

The unresolved disappearances again drew public attention after a key witness recently surfaced and accused his former employer, a gambling tycoon, of masterminding the killings, with bodies reportedly dumped in Taal Lake south of Manila or burned elsewhere.

National police chief Gen. Nicolas Torre III said in a news conference that a key witness, who used the alias “Totoy,” provided crucial details. The cockfighting aficionados and workers were strangled and mutilated before being dumped.

Police investigators have corroborated the details and evidence provided by the witness which will be used in criminal complaints to be filed by the Department of Justice against the suspects, he said.

The witness has told local TV networks that he decided to speak out because his former employer was allegedly threatening to have him killed. He said he wanted to help ease the agony of families of the victims who had been demanding justice for their missing kin.

“I was very shocked,” Torre said when asked how he felt over the disclosures made by the witness, who is under police guard. “It firmed up our resolve to really solve this because what happened was savage and not acceptable by any standard.”




Criminal complaints will be filed against the influential businessman, who owns cockfighting arenas and other gambling businesses, and other suspects, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said. The businessman has denied the allegations.

Remulla said he would ask Japan to help provide technology to help look for traces of the remains of the victims, which could still be retrieved from the bottom of Taal Lake about four years after the killings.

While banned in the United States and other Western countries largely due to animal cruelty concerns, cockfighting has been a popular pastime and gambling sport in many parts of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, Latin America and some parts of Europe.

Cockfighting arenas are found prominently in far-flung rural towns and major cities across the Philippines and draw large numbers of aficionados in an industry that has become a vibrant part of the local culture and a regulated gambling business that generates state revenues and thousands of jobs. The game involves pitting two roosters — with razor-sharp gaffs or steel blades attached to their legs — in a battle often to the death amid the roar of the crowd.

The missing cockfighting aficionados and workers were accused of cheating by discreetly taking steps to weaken one rooster or diminishing its chances of winning, including by slightly injuring it, then betting on the other rooster.

HOUSTON (AP) — Edson Álvarez scored a tiebreaking goal in the 77th minute after a video review reversed an offside call, and Mexico beat the United States 2-1 on Sunday night for its record 10th CONCACAF Gold Cup title.

Chris Richards put the U.S. ahead in the fourth minute, heading in a Sebastian Berhalter free kick for the second time in the tournament, but Raúl Jiménez tied the score in the 27th with his third goal of this Gold Cup.

Mexico was awarded the free kick when Diego Luna fouled Alexis Vega on a flank. Johan Vásquez flicked the restart across the goal mouth and Álvarez burst past the defense, redirecting the ball from 3 yards just inside Matt Freese's far post. While the play was initially called offside, the goal was awarded by the VAR, and Mexico defended its title from 2023 while improving to 6-2 in Gold Cup finals against the U.S.

Patrick Agyemang had a chance two minutes into stoppage time but he didn't make good contact on his short-range shot that was blocked by goalkeeper Luis Malagón.

“We're disappointed obviously to not come away with a win,” U.S. captain Tim Ream said.

A sellout crowd of 70,925 at NRG Stadium was about 70% pro-Mexico and booed U.S. players when they walked out for pregame warmups. Mexico dominated with 60% possession and had 12 corner kicks to none for the Americans.

This was the last competitive match for the U.S. and Mexico before co-hosting next year's World Cup with Canada.




The U.S., which has seven Gold Cup titles but none since 2021, used a starting lineup with only a handful of players currently projected as World Cup starters, missing regulars due to vacation, injuries and the Club World Cup.

Coach Mauricio Pochettino used their absence to evaluate players who could push for starting jobs during the friendlies this fall and next spring, and Luna, Agyemang and Freese emerged as contenders for World Cup roster spots.

Richards out the U.S. in front when he headed Berhalter's free kick from about 40 yards off the crossbar. The ball bounced straight down and just crossed the goal line.

Jiménez scored his 42nd international goal, third-most in Mexican history. He burst past the defense and one-timed the pass from Marcel Ruiz, beating Freese from about 10 yards on a shot that might have nicked Ream.

Jiménez celebrated by grabbing a Mexico No. 20 jersey with “DIOGO J” in honor of Diogo Jota, his former Wolverhampton teammate who died in a car crash Thursday in Spain. Jiménez ran to a corner, sat down with the jersey and mimicked playing a video game.

NEW YORK (AP) — Sean “Diddy” Combs got a standing ovation from fellow inmates when the music mogul returned to jail after winning acquittals on potential life-in-prison charges, providing what his lawyer says might have been the best thing he could do for incarcerated Black men in America.

“They all said: ‘We never get to see anyone who beats the government,'” attorney Marc Agnifilo told The Associated Press in a weekend interview days after a jury acquitted Combs of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges.

Combs, 55, remains jailed at a federal lockup in Brooklyn after his conviction Wednesday on prostitution-related charges, which could put him in prison for several more years. Any sentence will include credit for time already served. So far that's almost 10 months.

After federal agents raided Combs' homes in Los Angeles and the Miami area in March 2024, Agnifilo said he told the “I'll Be Missing You” singer to expect to be arrested on sex trafficking charges.

“I said: ‘Maybe it's your fate in life to be the guy who wins,'” he recalled during a telephone interview briefly interrupted by a jailhouse call from Combs. “They need to see that someone can win. I think he took that to heart.”




The verdict in Manhattan federal court came after a veteran team of eight defense lawyers led by Agnifilo executed a trial strategy that resonated with jurors. Combs passed lawyers notes during effective cross-examinations of nearly three dozen witnesses over two months, including Combs' ex-employees.

The lawyers told jurors Combs was a jealous domestic abuser with a drug problem who participated in the swinger lifestyle through threesomes involving Combs, his girlfriends and another man.

“You may think to yourself, wow, he is a really bad boyfriend,” Combs' lawyer Teny Geragos told jurors in her May opening statement. But that, she said, “is simply not sex trafficking.”

Agnifilo said the blunt talk was a “no brainer.”

“The violence was so clear and up front and we knew the government was going to try to confuse the jury into thinking it was part of a sex trafficking effort. So we had to tell the jury what it was so they wouldn't think it was something it wasn't,” he said.

Combs and his lawyers seemed deflated Tuesday when jurors said they were deadlocked on the racketeering count but had reached a verdict on sex trafficking and lesser prostitution-related charges. A judge ordered them back to deliberate Wednesday.

“No one knows what to think,” Agnifilo said. Then he slept on it.

“I wake up at three in the morning and I text Teny and say: ”We have to get a bail application together,” he recalled. “It's going to be a good verdict for us but I think he went down on the prostitution counts so let's try to get him out.”

He said he “kind of whipped everybody into feeling better” after concluding jurors would have convicted him of racketeering if they had convicted him of sex trafficking because trafficking was an alleged component of racketeering.

Agnifilo met with Combs before court and Combs entered the courtroom rejuvenated. Smiling, the onetime Catholic schoolboy prayed with family. In less than an hour, the jury matched Agnifilo's prediction.

The seemingly chastened Combs mouthed “thank you” to jurors and smiled as family and supporters applauded. After he was escorted from the room, spectators cheered the defense team, a few chanting: “Dream Team! Dream Team!” Several lawyers, including Geragos, cried.

“This was a major victory for the defense and a major loss for the prosecution,” said Mitchell Epner, a lawyer who worked with Agnifilo as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey over two decades ago. He credited “a dream team of defense lawyers” against prosecutors who almost always win.

Agnifilo showcased what would become his trial strategy — belittling the charges and mocking the investigation that led to them — last September in arguing unsuccessfully for bail. The case against Combs was what happens when the “federal government comes into our bedrooms,” he said.

During an eight-week trial, Combs' lawyers picked apart the prosecution case with mostly gentle but firm cross-examinations. Combs never testified and his lawyers called no witnesses.

Sarah Krissoff, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan from 2008 to 2021, said Combs' defense team “had a narrative from the beginning and they did all of it without putting on any witnesses. That's masterful.”

Ironically, Agnifilo expanded the use of racketeering laws as a federal prosecutor on an organized crime task force in New Jersey two decades ago, using them often to indict street gangs in violence-torn cities.

“I knew the weak points in the statute,” he said. “The statute is very mechanical. If you know how the car works, you know where the fail points are.”

He said prosecutors had “dozens of fail points.”

“They didn't have a conspiracy, they just didn't,” he said. “They basically had Combs' personal life and tried to build racketeering around personal assistants.”

Some personal assistants, even after viewing videos of Combs beating his longtime girlfriend, Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, had glowing things to say about Combs on cross examination.

For Combs, Agnifilo sees a long road ahead once he is freed and resumes work on personal demons, likely reentering a program for domestic batterers that he had just started before his arrest.

“He's doing OK,” said Agnifilo, who speaks with him four or five times daily.

He said Combs genuinely desires improvement and “realizes he has flaws like everyone else that he never worked on.”

“He burns hot in all matters. I think what he has come to see is that he has these flaws and there's no amount of fame and no amount of fortune” that can erase them,” he said. “You can't cover them up.”

For Agnifilo, a final surprise awaited him after Combs' bail was rejected when a man collapsed into violent seizures at the elevators outside the courtroom.

“I'm like: ‘What the hell?'” recalled the lawyer, who has experience in treating seizures.

Agnifilo straddled him, pulling him onto his side and using a foot to prevent him from rolling backward while a law partner, Jacob Kaplan, put a backpack under the man's head and Agnifilo's daughter took his pulse.

“We made sure he didn't choke on vomit. It was crazy. I was worried about him,” he said.

The man was eventually taken away conscious by rescue workers, leaving Agnifilo to ponder a tumultuous day.

“It was like I was getting punked by God,” he said.

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Typhoon Danas brought heavy winds and torrential rains to parts of Taiwan early Monday, killing two people and injuring more than 300 on the island's densely populated west coast.

The typhoon lost intensity and was downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved into the Taiwan Strait on a forecast path to China.

Danas knocked out power for more than 580,000 households, and schools and offices were closed across southern and central parts of Taiwan. 

The typhoon made landfall on the west coast late Sunday with maximum sustained winds of 144 kph (89 mph). It dumped more than 60 centimeters (24 inches) of rain in places, causing landslides and flooding.

Two deaths were reported in the southwestern city of Tainan, according to the National Fire Agency. One person died when their vehicle was struck by a falling tree, while another died after his respirator malfunctioned due to losing power.

At least 334 people suffered injuries, while more than 3,400 people were forced to evacuate – mostly from mountainous areas around the southern port city of Kaohsiung.

Thousands of tourists were stranded on Taiwan's outlying islands of Penghu, Matsu and Green due to the cancellations of ferry services and flights. 

Areas of southern and eastern China made preparations ahead of the storm, which is expected to reach the mainland Tuesday afternoon. Authorities in southern Guangdong province called hundreds of vessels to port and evacuated more than 2,000 people from offshore facilities. Two cities in the eastern Zhejiang province suspended ferry services and construction work.

Danas earlier intensified seasonal monsoon rains in the Philippines' northern mountains, flooding low-lying villages and forcing more than 3,000 people to flee to emergency shelters.




Taiwan routinely sees tropical storms between July and October, but they are more common on its sparsely populated eastern coast facing the Pacific.

MIAMI (AP) — Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a depression Sunday but raised concerns of possible flash flooding as it makes its way through central North Carolina toward south-central Virginia. 

Chantal made landfall near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, at about 4 a.m. EDT Sunday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. At 5 p.m., it was located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) south-southwest of Raleigh, North Carolina, and was moving north-northeast at 10 mph (17 kph) with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph (45 kph). 




The system was expected to turn more to the northeast late Sunday as it weakens over North Carolina but may strengthen slightly as it approaches the Virginia Capes on Monday. Flood watches were issued for central North Carolina and south-central Virginia through Monday, with total rainfall of 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) and local amounts up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) that could lead to flash flooding, the hurricane center said.

Forecasters said dangerous surf and rip currents at beaches from northeastern Florida to the mid-Atlantic states are expected to last for the next couple of days.

The Department of Homeland Security is moving to end temporary protected status (TPS) for Honduran and Nicaraguan migrants living in the U.S. today as the Trump administration continues to ramp up deportations across the country.

The decision to end TPS for the two nations comes weeks after DHS terminated the same status for Haiti and months after terminating TPS for Venezuelans. A federal judge has since blocked that termination amid an ongoing legal battle.

""Temporary Protected Status was designed to be just that—temporary,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told Fox News Digital. ""It is clear that the Government of Honduras has taken all of the necessary steps to overcome the impacts of Hurricane Mitch, almost 27 years ago.""

""Honduran citizens can safely return home, and DHS is here to help facilitate their voluntary return,"" Noem said. ""Honduras has been a wonderful partner of the Trump Administration, helping us deliver on key promises to the American people.  We look forward to continuing our work with them.""

A source at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) told Fox News Digital that revoking TPS will affect roughly 76,000 migrants currently living in the U.S., with 72,000 from Honduras and 4,000 from Nicaragua.

""The impacts of a natural disaster impacting Nicaragua in 1999 no longer exist,"" a DHS spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""The environmental situation has improved enough that it is safe enough for Nicaraguan citizens to return home. This decision restores integrity in our immigration system and ensures that TPS remains temporary.""

OBAMA-APPOINTED JUDGE TO RULE ON MOTION TO DISMISS IN HIGH-STAKES ABREGO GARCIA CASE HEARING

In May, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with the Trump administration in a ruling that lifted a San Francisco District Court Judge's injunction that temporarily blocked the termination of TPS for Venezuelans, paving the way for the administration to legally revoke TPS for subsequent nations.

DHS sources have informed Fox that Nicaraguans and Hondurans in the U.S. with TPS are being encouraged to use the CBP One app to facilitate a secure departure, including a complimentary plane ticket and a $1,000 exit bonus.

SWAMP GAMES: INSIDE NOEM'S CONTROVERSIAL 'ALLIGATOR ALCATRAZ' DETENTION STRATEGY

Created by Congress through the Immigration Act of 1990, TPS allows individuals from countries affected by natural disasters, war, or other dangerous, unusual circumstances to seek refuge in the U.S. This program can be renewed in 18-month increments.

Fox News national correspondent Jeff Paul has the latest on a drive-by shooting outside a Chicago nightclub that left multiple casualties and injuries on ‘The Faulkner Focus.' 

During a bloody Fourth of July weekend, more than 50 people were shot and six killed in Chicago, a notorious hot spot for violent crime. 

Several mass shootings and drive-by shootings accounted for the violence that occurred between midnight on Thursday, July 3, and Sunday night, according to ABC 7, which tracked the violence. 

On Saturday morning alone, a mass shooter injured four, three critically, in a drive-by attack in the city's Little Village neighborhood. Several suspects inside an SUV opened fire on the victims while they sat in their own vehicle, according to the report.

CHICAGO DRIVE-BY SHOOTING LEAVES AT LEAST 4 DEAD, 14 WOUNDED

Hours later, two men were reportedly shot dead in separate instances. 

The first was a 46-year-old man who was shot dead while sitting in his vehicle in the city's Lake View neighborhood. Police have a suspect in custody in that incident, the report said. 

A 30-year-old man was then found dead with a gunshot wound to the head on the city's West Side. Detectives are investigating, according to the report.

Within the span of minutes on Friday night, police reportedly responded to a spate of shootings, all on Chicago's South Side.

A 36-year-old man identified as Marco A. Velasquez-Sierra was found dead with a gunshot wound to the head, according to the report, and nobody is in custody following that shooting. 

Around the same time, two unidentified male suspects opened fire on a crowd of people, injuring seven, two critically. 

Then, another male suspect shot a 16-year-old girl and a 35-year-old man. The girl, identified as Meeyah Smith, died from a gunshot wound to the throat, according to ABC 7. No one is in custody following that shooting. 

Early Thursday morning, two women were shot, one fatally, also in the city's South Side. Both women were inside a home when an unidentified male suspect allegedly attempted to rob them. After a struggle, shots rang out. The deceased woman was 29.

CHICAGO, MY HOMETOWN, KEEPS WINNING IN ONE SHAMEFUL WAY

On the same morning, a 21-year-old man was reportedly shot dead in a drive-by shooting in South Side Chicago. 

Thursday morning's deadly shootings were accompanied by two separate mass shootings, one that injured four, and another that injured three, according to ABC 7. 

According to city data, there have been 205 homicides in Chicago this year, including 170 fatal shootings. 

Over Memorial Day weekend at the end of May, 22 people were shot, two fatally, in the city. 

The Chicago Police Department and Mayor Brandon Johnson's office did not immediately return comment requests.

The FBI and Department of Justice have concluded that Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex trafficker who died in jail nearly six years ago, committed suicide and had no “client list,” according to a report.

An Axios report detailed a memo from the federal law enforcement agencies that found no evidence Epstein blackmailed powerful figures, kept a “client list,” or was murdered in his Manhattan jail cell.

FBI officials, including Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino, have previously insisted that Epstein committed suicide while in prison, which the memo indicates is backed up by video footage, but had not previously commented on the other findings.

The FBI and DOJ's memo follows a lackluster release of some of the Epstein files to the public, a process that top officials vowed on the campaign trail would happen quickly.

In February, Attorney General Pam Bondi released a “first phase” of files related to Epstein but which contained little new information. When thousands of Epstein documents went unreleased in that batch, Bondi called on Patel to release “the full and complete Epstein files.” The FBI director later said in May that he was not “going to rush” the release, pointing out that it was taking longer than expected because of the many redactions related to the victims.

The slow release of the files had prompted backlash from figures on the Right, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA). Greene previously expressed interest in any evidence on how Epstein may have “gathered evidence on powerful people in order to blackmail them,” which the FBI and DOJ found “no credible evidence” for.

The agencies signaled in the memo that no more files will be released following these conclusions.

“It is the determination of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted,” the memo said, citing sensitive information related to the victims and the spreading of “unfounded theories” about Epstein.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

EXCLUSIVE — The Justice Department‘s Civil Rights Division is undergoing a complete internal transformation under President Donald Trump's second term — not just of enforcement strategy but of personnel, institutional practices, and long-held assumptions about how federal civil rights laws should be applied.

“When my memos went out, that culture changed,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, head of the division, told the Washington Examiner in an exclusive interview. “There's literally been lawyers there who spent their entire careers — over 40 years — doing the same thing, no matter who the president is.”

More than half of the division's attorneys left during the first quarter of this year, Dhillon said, clearing the way to rebuild the division from the ground up on the promise of sweeping changes under Trump. New hiring of career lawyers and political appointees is underway to align the department's civil rights enforcement with what Dhillon elucidated as the plain text of the law and the trajectory set by the Supreme Court.

Dhillon explained to the Washington Examiner that many of the attorneys who left had worked under previous Democratic administrations and were not receptive to Trump's directives.

“People are very upset with that — a lot of the career staff,” Dhillon said. “We're talking [former Presidents Joe] Biden era, [Barack] Obama era, [Bill] Clinton era, Jimmy Carter era, and probably even a few before that — Lyndon B. Johnson era, even — there may have been some lurking around.”

She said she delivered clear guidance to the division's more than 400 attorneys and support staff within weeks of taking office about new enforcement priorities aligned with Trump administration directives.

“We all know what the laws are, but within those laws, prosecutors and government lawyers have discretion as to their goals and their priorities,” Dhillon said. “Since we're an executive branch agency, our priorities are the president's priorities.”

The legal trajectory that has paved the way for changes at the DOJ's Civil Rights Division traces back to the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, which struck down race-based affirmative action policies in higher education. Dhillon said the decision has had sweeping implications for how the federal government oversees civil rights compliance across education, employment, and federal contracting.

That decision “made clear it is illegal to discriminate against anybody, not just minorities, in hiring,” she said. “We're just enforcing the law.”

Her office is investigating the University of California system's “UC 2030 Capacity Plan,” which includes diversity-based faculty recruitment goals. While her division has not made any final determinations about UC, she suggested that other institutions may soon face scrutiny.

“Just about every one of the 6,000 institutions of higher education that receives federal funds is probably out of compliance,” she said. Some have responded cooperatively. Others, such as Harvard, remain “recalcitrant” and are suing the United States, she said. However, Trump told pool reporters Friday that the administration was close to settling with the college but declined to comment on specifics.

The shift in the division's posture isn't limited to universities. In late May, Dhillon's office announced it was pulling out of proposed consent decrees with police departments in Minneapolis and Louisville — two cities that had been under federal investigation following the high-profile police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, which led to a summer of riots and unrest in 2020 during the Black Lives Matter demonstrations.

Those consent decrees, initiated during the Biden administration, were intended to impose federal oversight over local law enforcement, including mandatory reforms to training, discipline, and officer recruitment. But Dhillon said the department reviewed the facts and found that the agreements lacked sufficient legal justification to proceed.

“These were based on cherry-picked statistics and flawed legal theories,” she said. “In all the decades of doing consent decrees, the DOJ never actually won one of these cases at trial. They were imposed through pressure, not litigation.”

The division also moved to end investigations into police departments in Phoenix, Memphis, and Oklahoma City, calling the Biden-era proposals a form of “federal micromanagement” that would cost local governments hundreds of millions of dollars without meeting the burden of proof required under federal law.

Dhillon said the federal government's focus in past consent decree cases had ignored the interests of average citizens, especially in liberal bastions such as Seattle, where anarchists formed an autonomous zone during the 2020 riots. “Who's getting cut out in that equation? All the taxpayers, all the normal people living in those cities,” she said. “That culture may change when people begin to realize we didn't have to be under that consent decree — [that] our leadership sold us out.”

Asked how she plans to ensure the administration's changes stick beyond 2028, Dhillon pointed to the courts, not political messaging, as the stabilizing force.

It's not just “according to me,” she said. It's “according to the Supreme Court.”

She cited the high court's recent decision in the United States v. Skrmetti, which upheld Tennessee's ban on transgender procedures for minors under rational basis review.

“There's a rational basis for protecting children from irreversible harm,” she said. “That's the standard now.”

Despite the limited holding in Skrmetti, which applies mainly to states seeking to fortify laws protecting children from gender alteration procedures, she also suggested the decision's reasoning could likely influence other areas of law.

“So, can people claim that they're entitled to special treatment or a heightened level of scrutiny because they identify themselves as trans? I think the Supreme Court has answered that in at least one context, and I think that context is going to be easily translatable into other areas.”

Meanwhile, Dhillon vowed to course correct on a separate issue of law that many religious and anti-abortion conservatives accused of weaponization under the Biden administration — using the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act on peaceful protesters.

Trump himself chose to pardon 23 people convicted of violating the FACE Act, a law that has come under intense scrutiny from the Right due to allegations of its uneven application against anti-abortion advocates' First Amendment protections to protest outside clinics.

Still, Dhillon contended that FACE Act prosecutions have occurred — even under Biden — against perpetrators who attack faith-based pregnancy centers, underscoring that an important pillar going forward is that the FACE Act can and should be utilized against “houses of worship.”

“It's an important law as well, and so we aren't going to be criminalizing speech that doesn't rise to the level of interference. OK, so that's my promise,” she said, adding, “There is a cultural shift that has to happen outside the building, but inside the building, we're not going to be abusing those laws now.”

One day after Dhillon's interview, the Supreme Court announced it would hear two more cases that could define the next chapter in civil rights law: Little v. Hecox and B.P.J. v. West Virginia State Board of Education, both of which ask whether state laws banning biological male athletes in female sports violate the Constitution or Title IX.

“That's an issue that's part of our role in Title IX,” Dhillon said. “Several of these schools that you're going to see on the wrong side of the ‘v' in a lawsuit from the United States, they had that opportunity, and they fumbled the ball.”

The eventual rulings in the girls' sports cases next term could clarify whether gender identity is covered under federal education law, a key question for DOJ oversight.

‘FORK IN THE ROAD': HARMEET DHILLON CALLS ON CONSERVATIVE LAWYERS TO TAKE ON MORE CIVIL RIGHTS CASES

Not only is the Supreme Court working quickly to resolve these thorny culture war battles, but Dhillon's team has also moved quickly in the short three months she has been at one of the peak mantles for what she's described as the “largest law firm in the United States.”

“For the DOJ, what we do is we follow the law and where the law takes us,” she added.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Georgia Republicans are sounding alarms over Derek Dooley's floated Senate bid, calling the former football coach's potential run a risky distraction in what many see as the GOP's top pickup opportunity of 2026.

Dooley, a former Tennessee football coach and son of University of Georgia legend Vince Dooley, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in early June that he plans to decide in the coming weeks whether to enter the Republican primary.

Several GOP operatives, lawmakers, and strategists interviewed by the Washington Examiner questioned Dooley's political experience, name recognition, and fundraising ability, warning that another untested candidate could risk a top-tier pickup and complicate the party's efforts to grow its narrow Senate majority.

The seat is currently held by Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA), whose 2021 win helped cement Democratic control of the Senate at the time. With Republicans now controlling the upper chamber and eyeing expansion in 2026, Georgia has emerged as one of the party's top offensive targets. But insiders caution that the stakes are too high to risk nominating a political newcomer in what's expected to be one of the cycle's most expensive and competitive races.

The GOP field remains unsettled. So far, three candidates have officially entered the race: Rep. Buddy Carter (R-GA), state Insurance Commissioner John King, and activist Reagan Box. Several others are weighing bids, including Reps. Mike Collins (R-GA) and Rich McCormick (R-GA), Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, and state Sen. Greg Dolezal.

One conservative activist argued the current lineup has failed to inspire confidence.

“Everyone I talk with at the state Capitol to county GOP meetings thinks the current two candidates are total minor league operations that are not ready for the big game,” the person said. “And whoever thought up the Derek Dooley idea must be trying to pull a prank.”

Though he's never run for office, Dooley's appeal stems more from his family legacy than his coaching résumé. He's the son of Vince Dooley, the legendary University of Georgia football coach. He has deep personal ties to GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, who recently took himself out of the running for Senate. While Dooley hasn't been politically active in recent years, his family has previously aligned with Trump, including a 2016 endorsement from his father and a joint appearance at a campaign rally.

Kemp and Dooley's brother, Daniel, were college roommates, and the governor was a regular guest at the Dooley home growing up. Should Kemp publicly back him, Kemp's support could instantly boost Dooley's credibility in a crowded field.

A Georgia GOP operative, speaking anonymously, dismissed a potential Dooley bid as “one of the dumbest political moves” he's seen in two decades.

“He's a guy whose fame was being fired by Georgia's biggest rival 14 years ago,” the operative said.

The person questioned the viability of a Dooley candidacy, citing a lack of political engagement and absence of a clear campaign message.

“He's never been around. He hasn't supported Georgia Republican candidates or causes and has not been politically engaged,” the operative said. “On its surface, I have no concept of what the narrative would be.”

Many Republicans are eager to avoid repeating the internal fractures and missteps that cost them both of Georgia's Senate seats in the 2020 cycle. That year, GOP leaders backed Kelly Loeffler over Trump's preferred pick, then-Rep. Doug Collins. She lost to Democrat Raphael Warnock in a runoff, while Jon Ossoff defeated David Perdue, giving Democrats control of the chamber.

Two years later, Trump's handpicked candidate, Herschel Walker, also lost in a runoff despite Kemp belatedly stepping in to help. With Trump back in the White House and Republicans aiming to protect and expand their Senate majority, party strategists say they can't afford another mistake. 

“All a Dooley candidacy does, in my mind at this point, is make it more confusing,” said Jay Morgan, a veteran of Georgia GOP politics. “It doesn't bring any clarity to how Republicans get this seat and thereby make it more likely we keep the Senate majority in January 2027.”

Despite Kemp's support, Morgan argued that Dooley lacks the grassroots base and broad appeal needed to break through a crowded primary. Georgia's runoff system adds another layer of complexity, making it a “Herculean effort” just to make it into the top two.

Unlike Herschel Walker, who entered with star power, Dooley starts from “ground zero.” After two bruising Senate losses, Morgan warned, Republicans shouldn't take chances.

“If you were making this list a year ago, of the top ten people you would want to be the Senate nominee, Derek Dooley wouldn't have been on the list,” Morgan said. “So, why now?”

He added that Dooley likely wouldn't be in the mix if Brian Kemp weren't governor and questioned, “How much of the governor's political capital is he willing to loan him?”

Dooley, 56, began his football career as a walk-on wide receiver at the University of Virginia, eventually earning a scholarship. He later received a law degree from the University of Georgia and briefly practiced law in Atlanta before turning to coaching. He went on to lead programs at Louisiana Tech and Tennessee, where he was fired in 2012 after three losing seasons, including a loss to rival Vanderbilt. Since then, he's held assistant coaching roles with the Miami Dolphins, Dallas Cowboys, University of Missouri, New York Giants, and most recently served as an offensive analyst at the University of Alabama.

Should Dooley choose to enter the race, he wouldn't be venturing into uncharted territory. In Alabama, former Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville parlayed his football career into a successful Senate bid in 2020 and is now pursuing the governorship. Ohio's lieutenant governor, Jim Tressel, made his name at Ohio State. And in Nebraska, Tom Osborne served three terms in Congress after decades on the sidelines.

Now, as talk of a Senate run swirls, Dooley's backers are framing him as the kind of outsider who could defy expectations, much like others who've shaken up Georgia politics before.

“It shouldn't surprise anyone that political consultants and politicians hate the idea of an outsider shaking up the race for U.S. Senate and are already attacking someone who hasn't even announced their candidacy,” said Cody Hall, a senior adviser to Gov. Kemp and an operative close to Dooley. “The problem for the establishment is that voters will have the final say, just like they did with Gov. Kemp and President Trump.”

Dooley's team says he has held meetings with the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) and engaged with “many people and organizations” as he explores a potential Senate bid. 

While some Georgia Republicans remain deeply skeptical, others are urging caution, pointing to Kemp's long record of defying expectations.

A Capitol Hill Republican with ties to Georgia, granted anonymity to speak candidly, said the attention Dooley is receiving, even before announcing, suggests there may be more there than critics are willing to admit.

“It's telling that the person so many are worried about hasn't even announced yet,” the operative said, pointing to past conservative outsiders, including Kemp himself, who gained traction by hitting the trail and meeting voters face-to-face.

The operative added, “It would be a mistake for anybody looking at Georgia politics to not trust Gov. Kemp. His support would be incredibly beneficial and invaluable to anybody in a race like this.”

Others see Dooley's emergence as a necessary spark in an otherwise sluggish contest.

“This race is absolutely, like, lethargic,” said Ryan Mahoney, a Georgia Republican strategist. “No one's talking about it, no one's excited about it.” 

Mahoney noted that despite months on the trail and millions of dollars spent on ads, candidates such as Carter and King haven't generated much excitement.

“When the [Dooley] trial balloon was floated … people had questions and thoughts and opinions, but no one was saying, ‘Nope, I'm on Team Carter. I'm on Team King.' Everyone's still on the sidelines, going, who are the candidates?”

He argued that concerns about Dooley's outsider status are typical of political gatekeeping.

“Everyone loves being the outsider, until they're the insider, and then they're upset that outsiders want to come in and disrupt their game.”

GEORGIA REPUBLICANS BRACE FOR BRUISING SENATE PRIMARY WITH ‘PLAN B' HOPEFULS

Still, the possibility of another high-profile misstep has some Republicans nervous, especially those thinking beyond the primary.

One Georgia State GOP lawmaker warned, “At the end of the day, we need a governing partner in Washington.” The lawmaker added, “We've seen what happens when we lose focus and nominate someone who can't win a general election.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump is starring himself as the savior and New York City mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani as the devil in the political drama unfolding across the Big Apple.

A Democratic state assemblyman noted for his decisive primary win as a socialist candidate over former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Mamdani has emerged as the new darling of the national progressive movement, joining Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in calling for policies designed to appeal to working-class voters. 

As Mamdani rises within the progressive movement, he has become the favored bogeyman of Republicans, led by Queens native Trump, who called the mayoral hopeful a “Communist lunatic” on Wednesday morning. 

“I think it's very bad for New York. I don't know that he's gonna get in. It's inconceivable … he's a communist,” the president said last week. “I can't imagine it.” 

In a rare boost for Republicans, some Democrats have joined the criticism, warning that it could be a grave political miscalculation to mistake enthusiasm within certain circles for Mamdani's proposals, including raising taxes on the rich, providing free public buses and child care, freezing rent in subsidized units, and creating government-run grocery stores, with broader support for such ideas. 

“His solutions to those problems are not ones that will be roundly embraced in New York City, and I don't think they will be roundly embraced in the larger Democratic diaspora,” former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot told Politico. “Leading with ‘Let's tax the rich'? … It definitely appeals to a certain populace — people who believe there are people not paying their fair share of taxes. But I don't know if that's a winning formula.” 

Experts say there's another problem for Mamdani beyond alienating capitalist proponents or New York billionaires. Despite his campaign being grounded in pitches to voters disillusioned with New York's affordability crisis, Mamdani lost the working-class vote by a significant margin. 

“It was the millennials, overwhelmingly college-educated, white millennials, who successfully brought Mamdani to winning the Democratic primary,” Ivan Pongracic, an economics professor at Hillsdale College, told the Washington Examiner.

The working class, on the other hand, “is not interested in those ideas at all,” he continued. 

“I mean, it's ironic, because the whole idea of of socialism, from a Marxist perspective, is that it was an ideology that was supposed to appeal to the working classes … because they got the rawest deal under capitalism, and that is not what we are seeing these days at all,” the professor continued. “So it's a very strange thing, but the Democrat Party is not appealing with these ideas to the working classes at all at this point.” 

Mamdani built an impressive coalition to fend off Cuomo last month, crafting a grassroots campaign that spurred critical surges of support from young voters and made inroads into the Asian community. 

Mamdani's base believes in the socialist idea, Pongracic said, “of an omnipotent government that's going to be capable of controlling the economy.” The centralized system will “usher in perfect social justice, right? Because they see so many problems,” he said. 

But working-class voters, who form a critical voting bloc that could prove essential to winning the Big Apple's mayoral race, haven't embraced the movement, Pongracic warned. Nationally, such voters have long lined the Democrats' base, although Trump shocked pundits last year when they flocked to his campaign. In liberal New York, the demographic still seems stubbornly opposed to falling in line with Mamdani's socialist version of the party. 

Election results show that New York City's lower-income voters, including significant numbers of working-class black people, remained solidly in Cuomo's camp, a coalition that will likely transfer to Mayor Eric Adams ahead of the general election should the former governor pull his campaign. 

Where Cuomo won lower-income voters in areas such as southeast Queens and central Brooklyn by a margin of 13 points, Mamdani took middle- and higher-income voters in areas such as western Queens and northern Brooklyn by margins of 10 and 13 points, respectively, according to the New York Times. 

Cuomo won heavily among black or lower-income working-class populations in areas such as Springfield Gardens, Canarsie, East Flatbush, and St. Albans, by respective margins of 43, 41, 37, and 35 points.

Mamdani won areas that tended to be whiter, younger, and more affluent and secured by margins of 66 points in Bushwick, 43 points in Bedford-Stuyvesant, 39 points in Fort Greene, 39 points in Long Island City, 32 points in Park Slope, 27 points in Astoria, 27 points in Williamsburg, and 26 points in Jackson Heights. 

“What we are finding is that there's an enormous level of enthusiasm and support for socialist ideas among the millennials, in particular,” Pongracic said, pointing to “massive audiences” Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders encountered during their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour this spring. 

“So that is where the enthusiasm and where the real strength of the Democrat Party is right now,” he continued. “It's a huge liability for the Democrat Party because outside of the millennial group, these ideas are not popular. And if you look at, you know, Gen X or boomers, or even Gen Z, they, in general, are not drawn to these ideas. So for the Democrat Party, enthusiasm for Democrat socialism probably spells electoral defeat.”

One aspect of Mamdani's candidacy that Republicans hope will lead to his defeat involves the candidate's past support for ideas like “seizing the means of production,” a communist policy birthed in Marxist theory, which they have used to brand him as an extreme candidate deeply out of touch with mainstream consciousness. 

“At the heart of all socialist economic systems is that the government is in control of at least the major means of production, and sometimes all means of production,” Pongracic said, later adding that “a lot of Democrats” find enthusiasm for such ideas “alarming.” 

“They don't think that that's the traditional Democrat message. [But] this is where the Democrat Party is heading. It is heading further left,” he said. 

Ahead of the general election, Trump has gladly rallied the charge against Mamdani, portraying himself as New York City's savior who will not let “this Communist Lunatic destroy” his birthplace. 

“Rest assured, I hold all the levers, and have all the cards. I'll save New York City, and make it ‘Hot' and ‘Great' again, just like I did with the Good Ol' USA!” the president said Wednesday morning. 

Still, while Trump believes Republicans will have the last word, the debate about socialism is likely one that is here to stay, as millennials will soon be the largest voting bloc in the country. And enthusiasm for such policies has only grown in recent decades, posing a looming challenge to traditionalists in both the Democratic and Republican camps. 

HOUSE HANDS TRUMP HIS JULY 4 VICTORY WITH PASSAGE OF ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'

As New York City emerges as the latest testing ground for progressive Democrats, pollsters say Mamdani could face a tough path to victory ahead of the general election, saying the race will likely hinge on voter turnout. 

“In theory, Zohran could be vulnerable,” pollster Nate Silver wrote in an analysis of the race last Tuesday. “Whether you count his [primary] victory margin as 7 percent or 12 percent, that's extremely impressive for a candidate who started out polling as low as 1 percent in some surveys. But it's also not an insurmountable margin. While slightly over a million votes were cast in the Democratic primary, New York City has 5.1 million registered voters.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

It was November 2024, and Democrats had just suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of President Donald Trump. 

Democratic lawmakers and strategists quickly acknowledged that their party had drifted far afield from the working-class voters who once made up their base, and they began to discuss the need to pivot away from some of the unpopular messaging that had fueled that shift.

But several months into Trump's presidency, their recalibration has seemingly stalled. Fighting the Trump agenda on every front, many Democrats have found themselves fiercely defending positions that were just recently at the heart of the party's soul-searching efforts, solely because Trump has taken the other side.

“Democrats willingly took the least popular position on those issues – perhaps the most popular among their activist base, but the least popular among independents and the general public – and then Trump brilliantly locked them into those positions by strenuously opposing them,” Charles Lipson, political science professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, told the Washington Examiner. “That [would otherwise] put Democrats in the untenable position of agreeing with Trump in a party that has no leaders and no real agenda.”

“Its only unifying theme is opposition to Trump,”  Lipson added. “And it is just political death, in a Democratic primary in most states, to endorse Trump's position on virtually any issue.”

On immigration, Democrats have retreated from their nascent recognition that the party's embrace of illegal migration without limits during the first three years of the Biden administration had cost them. Many are now openly opposed to deportations of any kind, including of convicted murderers who were in the U.S. illegally.

On transgender issues, Democrats have gone from acknowledging that their absolutist positions alienated millions of voters to defending the most radical among them, such as allowing children to undergo medical treatments that can have permanent effects on their development and fertility.

And in a litany of fights Trump has picked with elite institutions, such as universities and the legacy media, Democrats have sided almost unanimously with Trump's targets, even though the public's trust in those institutions has plummeted and even when the institutions themselves admit the need for the kinds of changes Trump has demanded. 

Some Democrats and left-leaning commentators conceded that images of an out-of-control border and city facilities overflowing with migrants had driven away voters ahead of the 2024 election.

“[I]f you look at the polling, there's just no evidence that that is ever what Americans wanted,” David Leonhardt, editorial director at the left-leaning New York Times opinion desk, told the New Yorker in an interview in March. “It was part of this broader shift to the left of the Democratic Party between roughly 2015 and 2020 to follow the wishes of very progressive, largely affluent members.” 

Ruy Teixiera, a longtime Democratic political scientist now affiliated with the American Enterprise Institute, noted in January that the Democrats' problems on immigration went beyond the political problems associated with bad campaign messaging and instead spoke to the deeper issues that arise when voters perceive one party as being bad at actually governing. 

“Democrats have developed a philosophy about immigration that prizes ideological commitments over the mundane realities of a secure border, public order and enforcement of the law,” Teixeira wrote on his Substack days after Trump's inauguration. “Until Democrats decisively reject that philosophy and show by their actions that they are committed to stopping illegal immigration with every tool at government's disposal and restoring order to the immigration system, voters will continue to regard Democratic governance in this area as very poor indeed.”

A handful of vulnerable Democrats won their races on the night that then-Vice President Kamala Harris lost hers by running to the right of their party on immigration, and they attempted to convince others at the start of Trump's presidency that moving toward the center on the issue was necessary.

“When the Democrats basically dropped the ball on the chaos on the border for many years, we essentially lost the debate on immigration reform for years, because the everyday voter doesn't trust us. For years they saw that chaos on the border, and we did nothing,” Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) told the New York Times in February.

“[S]​​omehow we decided that we were going to essentially just give the issue to the Republicans,” Gallego said. “We could have had a very sane position on this.”

But Democrats have, in the months since, struggled to find that sane position. 

Democrats have fought virtually every attempt by Trump to deliver on his promise to lock down the border and conduct mass deportations, including the ones that appear to have broad support.

Some Democrats have even embraced public spectacles meant to demonstrate their commitment to illegal immigrants. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) sparked international headlines when he traveled to El Salvador to visit a suspected MS-13 gang member, accused domestic abuser, and alleged human smuggler who had lived illegally in Maryland after the Trump administration deported him to his home country in violation of a judge's order allowing for his deportation anywhere but El Salvador. Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-NJ) faces criminal charges for allegedly shoving federal law enforcement officers outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center amid a protest over deportations.

“I think Democrats have sought to duck any conversation about immigration,”  Jeff Hauser, a Democratic strategist and the founder and executive director of the Revolving Door Project, told the Washington Examiner. “But the extremism of the Trump agenda has kind of compelled them to react.”

SUPREME COURT MAKES TRUMP WAIT ON KEY DECISIONS

Democrats have more recently focused their messaging around the idea that the Trump administration is violating the due process rights of essentially all the illegal immigrants it has sought to remove. They have amplified the rulings of judges who found ways to block various deportation efforts, even when higher courts have overturned them.

That has allowed Democrats to place their support for allowing illegal immigrants to stay in the country at a rhetorical remove, giving them the ability to appear more centrist by arguing that their concern is with the means of Trump's deportation agenda without having to articulate their position on the ends.

But without a clear answer to the question of how the party should change its immigration proposals in response to its 2024 defeat, Democrats risk letting Trump drag them into fights they can't easily win.

“I think that they are probably going to end up back on some version of comprehensive immigration reform, because that's been their position for the last couple of decades,” Hauser said. “What's changed is how they've emphasized whether they try to talk about it or not.”

After Harris's past positions on transgender issues, such as her support for providing taxpayer-funded sex change surgeries to prison inmates who request them, came back to haunt her during the 2024 race, Democrats publicly and privately began reconsidering their party's transgender advocacy.

Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA), for example, made waves in November when he said in an interview that he did not want his two daughters to have to play sports with male athletes while acknowledging that “as a Democrat, I'm supposed to be afraid to say that.” The backlash he received from his own party quickly illustrated why. 

California Gov. Gavin Newsom became the highest-profile Democrat to test a more centrist message on transgender issues when, in March, he said on a podcast that he views biological boys competing on girls' sports teams as “deeply unfair.”

And Rep. Sarah McBride (D-DE), the country's first transgender member of Congress, recognized that the transgender movement's maximalist demands had cost it public support.

“I think some of the cultural mores and norms that started to develop around inclusion of trans people were probably premature for a lot of people,” McBride said in an interview last month. “We became absolutist — not just on trans rights but across the progressive movement — and we forgot that in a democracy we have to grapple with where the public authentically is and actually engage with it.”

But the Trump administration's efforts to use some of the same laws Democrats had relied upon as the basis for their transgender policies, such as Title IX, to enforce its anti-transgender agenda has seemingly stunted the party's soul-searching on the issue. A significant loss for transgender activists at the Supreme Court last month drew many Democrats into defending a position — that children should have access to irreversible gender-related medical treatments — some in the party recognize as deeply unpopular.

“I think that Democrats have never really wanted to talk about trans issues,” Hauser said. “I think that Democrats believe that passivity is a political strategy and I don't think it actually is. Democrats are kind of scared of putting forth a vision on issues.”

“I think the 2024 election reveals that if you don't put out your own vision, one is going to be ascribed to you,” he added.

Some Democrats have rallied around the idea of allowing transgender athletes to compete on the teams that align with their gender identity since Trump set out to ban it. Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a relatively unknown Democrat, attracted national attention in February when she vowed to fight the Trump administration in court over its pledge to interpret Title IX as precluding transgender inclusivity in sports, rather than allowing it. 

However, if, as McBride suggested, the goal of Democrats should be to tether their positions on transgender issues to public perception, the party has so far failed.

Only a quarter of U.S. adults believe doctors should legally be allowed to prescribe medical treatments to children for gender transitions; even fewer believe transgender athletes should be allowed to compete on the sports teams that align with their gender identity, according to the Pew Research Center.

“I think this is the first time in decades when the Democrats have lost the messaging war on cultural issues, and I think that they've lost it because they refuse to be ‘out progressived' on any issue,” said Lipson, the political science professor. “That's put them in the position of wanting elementary school children to see drag shows, and they want biological men who identify as women to play sports against women.” 

Democrats' inability to stake out their own ground on transgender issues has, like in other areas, largely let Trump dictate where they stand. They know opposing Trump is popular with their voters, but many struggle to move beyond the resistance into what might come next.

Hauser said Democrats should stop being afraid to say things that are unpopular. 

“I think that Democrats have an authenticity problem,” Hauser said. “The Democratic Party in general is characterized by people who sound like they talked to pollsters before they talked to people.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) sent a letter to Department of Commerce acting Inspector General Roderick Anderson, asking him to investigate whether cuts at the National Weather Service affected the response to the tragic Texas floods.

There have been questions about whether NWS staff cuts due to the Trump administration's cost-saving mission could have led to a slower response to the floods, though the Department of Homeland Security has strongly rejected those claims. DHS outlined the various warnings sent out from the NWS, dating back to the morning of July 3. At least 82 people are dead from a deluge that hit central Texas over the Fourth of July weekend.

Among the 82 dead are nearly two dozen children, most from Camp Mystic, a summer camp near the Guadalupe River. The mass casualty event is one of the deadliest for children in United States history. Twenty children were killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012.

“Following the disastrous and deeply devastating flash flooding in Texas this weekend, I urge you to immediately open an investigation into the scope, breadth, and ramifications of whether staffing shortages at key local National Weather Service (NWS) stations contributed to the catastrophic loss of life and property during the deadly flooding,” Schumer wrote in the Monday letter.

The NWS is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Experts previously warned that cutting staff or funds to NOAA could lead to more weather-related deaths because of slower warnings and less accurate forecasts.

Schumer cited the New York Times's reporting that the NWS offices in San Angelo and San Antonio had critical vacancies during the floods. They explained that positions such as warning coordination meteorologist, science officer, hydrologist, and other vital forecasting, meteorology, and coordination roles were vacant.

The vacancy rate across the NWS offices has roughly doubled since January, the New York Times reported.

“The roles left unfilled are not marginal, they're critical. These are the experts responsible for modeling storm impacts, monitoring rising water levels, issuing flood warnings, and coordinating directly with local emergency managers about when to warn the public and issue evacuation orders. To put it plainly: they help save lives,” Schumer wrote.

However, the same outlet also reported that the failure to adopt a new local warning system, or “last mile” efforts, also contributed to residents not seeing the many alerts from NWS. 

Schumer is asking Anderson, who has been deputy inspector general of the Commerce Department since 2019 before taking over the head position at the start of the Trump administration, whether the cuts affected the flooding event, delayed flood warnings, or had an impact on their coordination with emergency officials.

He is also asking about specific vacancies across the United States and in the San Angelo and San Antonio offices, whether risk assessments have been performed for the shortage of staff, whether restoring staffing levels would help, and whether the two offices were operationally equipped for the floods.

A Commerce Department spokesperson told the New York Times that the “timely and accurate forecasts and alerts for Texas this weekend prove that the NWS remains fully capable of carrying out its critical mission.”Independent experts denied that the forecasting or warnings were insufficient.

“The forecasting was good. The warnings were good. It's always about getting people to receive the message,” Chris Vagasky, a meteorologist based in Wisconsin, told NBC News. “It appears that is one of the biggest contributors — that last mile.”

Nevertheless, Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, seemed to blame the NWS for inaccurate rainfall forecasts.

“The amount of rain that fell in this specific location was never in any of those forecasts,” he said.

As a result of all the rain, dangerous flash floods occurred. Flash floods can overwhelm places with water very quickly. Camp Mystic was one of the most affected sites, and its director, Dick Eastland, reportedly gave his life while trying to save children from the flooding.

Photos showed the camp in disarray as the world, including several world leaders and President Donald Trump, mourned the tragedy at Camp Mystic. Trump said he will visit Texas on Friday to survey the flood damage.

TEXAS DEMOCRAT SEEKS ANSWERS ON ‘MISSING KEY' WEATHER PERSONNEL AS FLOOD DEATHS RISE

Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX) remarked on Sunday that the cuts at the NWS should be investigated as they pertain to the floods. Castro said he did not want to say “conclusively” whether the cuts did affect the response.

“I don't think it's helpful to have missing key personnel from the National Weather Service not in place to help prevent these tragedies. When I say we ought to do everything possible to help prevent a tragedy. … That's part of what I mean,” Castro said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The federal government should prohibit the wearing of masks by ICE agents and require them to properly identify themselves.

From 2011 to 2013, I commanded the New York City Police Department's 6th Precinct, which covers Greenwich Village. We had a team of plainclothes officers who went out looking for serious crimes in progress. Sometimes they worked out of a dilapidated unmarked van that looked like the one driven by the villain in The Silence of the Lambs. When things were slow, the team would arrest people who had slunk off from Bleecker Street to smoke weed on Minetta Lane. The sergeant who led these officers had come down from the Bronx, and he thought there was a certain justice in holding the Village's nightlife crowd to the same standard we held Black teenagers in Kingsbridge Heights.

One evening in 2012, the team noticed a woman smoking in the shadows and decided to make an arrest. The officers placed her in handcuffs, led her to the van, and opened its back doors. At the other end of the cargo bay, a burly man sat on a milk crate in the dark, waiting. The woman went weak in the knees, her eyes filled with panic, and she groaned. At that point the sergeant realized that the prisoner had no idea who these officers were. She was helpless and she was terrified.

Something like this scene has been playing out across America lately. Under orders from Donald Trump's White House, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is aiming to deport 1 million immigrants a year, and to make 3,000 arrests a day. Agents have detained farmhands and meat processors; garment and construction workers; graduate students; the mayor of Newark, New Jersey; and people who turn out to be completely innocent. But if immigration enforcement is more aggressive and visible than in the past, it is also more anonymous: ICE allows its agents to conduct operations in plain clothes and to cover their faces. Social media is flooded with images of masked men forcing people into unmarked cars.

This approach looks scary. It is scary. And it's a grave mistake. In keeping with the values of the local police, the federal government should prohibit the wearing of masks by its officers and require them to properly identify themselves. These are the minimal requirements of policing a free state—regardless of how you feel about the administration's stance on immigration. You can support ambitious deportation targets without sanctioning anonymous policing.

The main reason federal agents give for wearing masks is their fear of doxxing: the practice of sharing a person's identity and contact information with the malicious intent of targeting them for harassment, threats, and possibly violence. Federal agents and their families deserve privacy and safety, but the government already has a means of protecting them: It can enforce the laws against harassment and threats, online or in person. Or Congress could pass an existing bill that explicitly makes doxxing federal law-enforcement agents illegal.

At any rate, everyone in government today is vulnerable to doxxing, including countless public servants who have no option to hide their identity as they work. Should a pool of judges issue anonymous verdicts? Should legislators pass bills by secret ballot? The answers are obvious. Wearing a badge is thought to require, and should require, more bravery than serving on a state assembly. Our police should be the (literal) face of the nation's courage, unafraid to show the public who they are.

Nick Miroff: The terrible optics of ICE enforcement are fueling a Trump immigration backlash

Perhaps most important, wearing masks could expose federal agents, local police, and the public to physical dangers that make the risks of doxxing seem minor in comparison. Armed, masked men appear sinister, even predatory. Beyond obscuring the facial expressions we use for cues about whether a person is a threat, masks are a marker of criminals looking to intimidate their prey while avoiding identification. This is why the ski mask is a cultural trope of the armed robber or terrorist. It is also why masked protesters undermine their own causes; the masks arouse deep suspicion, as bystanders may assume the protesters are just waiting for an opportune moment to break the law. Nor is that a baseless assumption: In my experience, masked protesters sometimes are opportunistic lawbreakers.

As ICE agents rack up arrests on the road to 1 million deportations, someone will inevitably, instinctively fight back against the masked men forcing them into a car, not because they want to escape law enforcement but because they don't know whom they are trying to escape from in the first place, and they legitimately fear for their safety. As a former police officer, I can tell you that my first reaction to unidentified men in masks converging on me or someone nearby would be to take cover and prepare to fight.

Another possible hazard is that masked, unidentified ICE agents could be mistaken by local police for armed felons committing a robbery or an abduction. Misidentified police officers taking enforcement action in plain clothes or off duty have been killed by fellow officers with a tragic regularity. Perhaps most dangerous of all, as ICE normalizes mask wearing, it creates the conditions for violent criminals to pass as police while escaping identification. In fact, criminals have already started to impersonate ICE agents.

Many people on the left, perennially skeptical of how our nation is policed, think masking by federal agents is wrong. But so does the right-libertarian CATO Institute, which recently published an argument critical of mask wearing. It asked, “At what point will we as a nation find ourselves with a secret police?” A former FBI agent and a former Department of Homeland Security attorney have also spoken up against masking.

Police departments throughout the country understand these risks and require their officers to be clearly identifiable by face, name, and agency. Until earlier this century, the NYPD restricted its officers' winter headwear to an archaic mouton hat and earmuffs. In a nod to modernity, the NYPD relaxed this rule, allowing officers to wear a balaclava on patrol if the temperature was expected to drop below freezing. But the accompanying regulations clearly state that the balaclava must fully expose the officer's face; with exceptions for the protective equipment worn by emergency-service officers during tactical operations, as well as for the use of gas masks, the NYPD has never permitted officers to obscure their face. In the same vein, except during undercover operations, all NYPD officers are required to “courteously and clearly” provide their name, rank, and shield number to anyone who requests it, either verbally or via a preprinted card with the information.

Anne Applebaum: This is what Trump does when his revolution sputters

The driving principle here is obvious: In a free society, people should know who is policing them. To codify this sentiment in the law, New York legislators have proposed a ban on mask wearing by ICE agents, and California legislators have put forward a bill that would ban federal, state, and local police from wearing masks when interacting with the public. (The California bill exempts members of SWAT teams conducting tactical operations if a mask could reduce exposure to heat, fire, chemicals, and contaminants.) The legislation addresses a crucial issue, but it exemplifies the overkill of our times: We shouldn't need a law to ensure a basic feature of transparent policing. Federal agencies should adopt this policy as a matter of course.

As a person who served as a police officer for 23 years, I never doubted that I practiced a noble profession. It is noble work in part because officers willingly take real risks for the sake of the greater good. When my boys were young, I used to tell them that I couldn't guarantee that I would come home safe at the end of a shift—only that, if I were injured, it would be for a reason they could forever be proud of.

Hiding your face from the public as a federal agent undermines the legitimacy of our nation's police, and can be mistaken for cowardice. Although the risks of showing your face as you police America's streets are not negligible, they're worth taking, because the consequences of concealment are more dire. This is why the hazards of policing are morally different from those of being, say, a lumberjack, even though felling trees is statistically more dangerous than making arrests. In policing a free society, some of the risks arise from protecting freedom itself, so even if you can reduce those risks, you often shouldn't.



Descending on a person in public, laying hands on them, and taking them to a distant prison is a naked expression of state power. For it to be tolerated in a democracy committed to an inalienable right to liberty, it must be just that: naked. It cannot be done by shadowy, masked agents. That evening in Greenwich Village, in the quest for a weed arrest, my plainclothes sergeant would have been within his rights to haul off his prisoner in an unmarked van. But he also knew that much more was at issue than his prerogative to enforce the law. “We're the NYPD,” he told the woman in handcuffs. “We'll wait here until I call a marked car to the scene. Uniformed officers will explain who we are, and what's going to happen. You're safe with us.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Political violence poses an existential threat to our nation and our freedoms—but it's not too late.

You would be forgiven for not knowing which lesson, exactly, Americans ought to take from the bloody morning of September 13, 1859. On that day, in the mouth of a clearing by Lake Merced, in the hills of San Francisco, two men decided to settle an argument the old-fashioned way: with a pair of handcrafted .58-caliber pistols and a mutual death wish.

Theirs wasn't the most famous duel in American history. But David Terry's murder of his friend turned rival David Broderick that California morning is, I would argue, America's second-most-famous duel, and possibly its most consequential.

Broderick and Terry had originally traveled westward in search of gold—Broderick from his hometown of Washington, D.C., and Terry by way of Russellville, Kentucky. Instead they found careers in public service, which is how they crossed paths: Broderick as a U.S. senator, Terry as the chief justice of the California Supreme Court. They were both Democrats, but very different kinds of Democrats, at a moment when those differences were matters of life and death. Over the years, their friendship had been badly strained by the question of slavery—Terry was for it, Broderick against. This disagreement hardened into disgust. Their relationship fell apart publicly and spectacularly. Locals were so seized by the drama that on that fateful Tuesday in September, a caravan of spectators rode out in carriages to the lake to watch the ritual unfold.

The duel ended as duels often did, quickly and irreversibly. Ten paces, wheel around, fire. Broderick had a reputation as a superior marksman. He was also given first dibs on his position at the dueling grounds. But neither advantage did him any good. The hair trigger on his pistol—the guns, with their smooth walnut handles, had been provided by a Terry ally—meant that Broderick accidentally fired too early, the bullet disappearing into the sandy soil at his feet. Terry knew he could take his time. He aimed his pistol carefully. He shot. Broderick crumpled. He died three days later.

Duels were still common in those days, and although they were not exactly popular with the public, they were tolerated. (At the time, the U.S. Navy lost two-thirds as many men to duels as to combat.) Duels were a matter of honor, and an established political rite.

Broderick's murder changed all of that. He was the first—and still the only—sitting U.S. senator to be killed in a duel. His death made headlines nationwide, as newspapers recounted the face-off obsessively. The public was mesmerized by the coverage but also repulsed by the violence. After that, Americans still dueled here and there, but not as they had before. Today, many consider the Broderick-Terry duel to have been the last real American duel—the one that turned the nation against dueling once and for all.

I was thinking about Broderick and Terry recently after a gunman disguised as a police officer assassinated the lawmaker Melissa Hortman, along with her husband, Mark, in their Minnesota home last month. For many years I have been preoccupied by questions about political violence in America—most of all with the question of how to interrupt a cycle of political violence before more people are killed. Those who study political violence have told me that it frequently takes a catastrophe to shake a numbed citizenry to its senses about the violence all around them. Ending any cycle of political violence requires a strong collective rejection—including the imposition of a political and social cost for those who would choose or cheer on violence to get their way.

When I wrote about this subject at length for this magazine, in an April 2023 story, William Bernstein, the author of The Delusions of Crowds, told me he was not optimistic that anything other than a violent shock to the system would work against the current spasm of political violence in America. By that point it had become clear that any hope that January 6, 2021, would prompt a course correction—that it could be the event that forced Americans into a shared mass rejection of political violence—had long since evaporated. “The answer is—and it's not going to be a pleasant answer—the answer is that the violence ends if it boils over into a containable cataclysm,” Bernstein told me at the time. What if, he went on—“I almost hesitate to say this”—but what if they actually had hanged Mike Pence or Nancy Pelosi on January 6? “I don't think it ends without some sort of cathartic cataclysm,” he said. “I think, absent that, it just boils along for a generation or two generations.”

I have heard echoes of that bleak projection from many experts in the intervening years. Given that the violence in our nation is not only tolerated but often celebrated, I worry more now than I did even two years ago about how bad it will have to get for this particular fever to break.

In addition to the recent assassinations in Minnesota, Americans have in the past year alone witnessed two assasination attempts against Donald Trump; the Midtown Manhattan murder of the UnitedHealthcare CEO; an arson attack at the home of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro; the murder of a young couple leaving the Capital Jewish Museum, in Washington; the murder of an 82-year-old woman in a firebombing attack in Colorado; and the attempted kidnapping of the mayor of Memphis. With startling frequency, Americans are attempting to resolve political disagreement through violence. And all the while, leaders at the highest levels of American government are aggressively stoking this national bloodlust, and demonstrating a willingness to carry out violence against citizens.

The president of the United States has repeatedly fantasized about violently hurting and even killing Americans. He describes those who disagree with him politically as “vermin” and has said that “the threat from outside forces is far less sinister, dangerous, and grave than the threat from within.” Trump infamously mused about executing General Mark Milley, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and proceeded to take away Milley's security detail. (His anger was prompted by a profile of Milley by The Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, who detailed the numerous ways that Milley had defended the U.S. Constitution from Trump during his first presidency.)

Trump has repeatedly described, in bizarre detail, his desire to see American journalists suffer—he is specifically preoccupied with fantasies of journalists being beaten and raped in prison. According to Trump's former defense secretary Mark Esper, Trump implored Esper to have troops shoot into a crowd of protesters. (Trump has denied this.) And on January 6, as Trump's supporters ransacked the U.S. Capitol, he angrily pushed back against those in his administration who expressed alarm, saying, “I don't fucking care that they have weapons. They're not here to hurt me,” as his former aide Cassidy Hutchinson has testified. Trump promised he would act as a dictator on the first day of his second term. And on that day, he pardoned more than 1,500 people who had been convicted for their actions in the 2021 insurrection, including those with ties to various extremist groups and those who had violently attacked law enforcement at the Capitol.

One of the most chilling aspects of living through any period of intense political violence is not knowing, while you are in it, how long it will last or how bad it will get. That is in part because, somewhat counterintuitively, you can't properly account for political violence simply by tallying attacks. As Erin Miller, the longtime program manager at the University of Maryland's Global Terrorism Database, once told me, “There are a lot of people who are out for a protest, who are advocating for violence,” but who will never actually take violent action. “Then there's a smaller number at the tip of the iceberg that are willing to carry out violent attacks.”

We're not yet at the level of violence that plagued the nation during the Civil War, nor even at the level of violence that ripped through American cities in the years before and after World War I, when dynamite attacks were common. Scholars lately have been debating whether things are officially as bad as they were in the 1960s and '70s. And many point out that America's political-violence problem could just as easily be described as a gun-violence problem. As the legendary columnist Henry Fairlie wrote in The Washington Post shortly after the attempt on then-President Ronald Reagan's life, in 1981: “Nothing links Lee Harvey Oswald to Sirhan Sirhan to Arthur Bremmer to Sarah Jane Moore to Lynette Fromme to John Warnock Hinckley Jr., except guns.” No matter where you fall on the spectrum of these debates, political violence in America is clearly worsening across several key measures.

Vigilante violence is on the rise—mostly in the form of lone-wolf attacks, or what the FBI sometimes calls “salad-bar extremism.” At the same time, organized violence may be poised to resurge—not only because so many leaders of violent extremist groups recently waltzed out of prison with their golden-ticket Trump pardons, but also because of the ever more extreme tenor of political debate in America. In a recent report from a nonpartisan group at Princeton University about the biggest threats we face in 2025, researchers found that immigrant groups are at an especially high risk of political violence this year and for the foreseeable future. “Proposed bounty bills, in particular, could embolden private citizens to engage in self-styled enforcement actions targeting immigrants and their allies,” the report said.

At the same time, trust in law enforcement is down. Police killings of citizens are back up. Death threats and violent attacks against public servants are way, way, way up. And although many Americans are highly concerned about domestic political violence, many people are also moving toward violence rather than away from it. A 2024 poll shows that as many as one in five Americans believes they may have to resort to violence to get what they want. A more recent poll shows that even more Americans—one in three—believes that “because things have gotten so far off track, Americans may have to resort to violence in order to save our country.”

One of the challenges of addressing political violence in America lies in navigating the many intellectual cul-de-sacs—all worthy in their own right—that can distract from the task of preventing further violence. There are debates over what counts as political violence in the first place. (I favor a simple, classic definition: Political violence is violence that is intended to prevent or provoke change.) There are arguments over how bad political violence actually is. (My colleague Graeme Wood makes a persuasive argument that everyone in America should actually just calm down about all this.) And, of course, there are legitimate disagreements over when and whether resorting to violence is ever morally permissible, or even necessary (a people's uprising against an oppressive dictator, for example). And some violence is already seen as permissible by law—acting, for instance, in self-defense.

Political violence is of course fundamentally at odds with the philosophy of democratic self-governance. This is because violence poses an existential threat to the conditions—republican independence and freedom from government interference chief among them—that allow for the people to hold power. Or as Sarah Birch, the author of Electoral Violence, Corruption, and Political Order, has put it: “A community that will tolerate violence will get violence. A community that does not tolerate violence is much less likely to have violence.” Birch has argued that it is up to “every single citizen to condemn violence and to talk in such a way that makes it unacceptable.”

She's right that the communities that tolerate violence will get it. They'll get it from vigilantes, from organized extremist groups, and—most concerning of all—from the state itself. Throughout history and around the world, periods of political violence have been met with the enthusiastic opportunism of those who seek to quash democracy and seize power for themselves. Even in instances where resorting to violence gains broad public support—as when, for example, workers facing deadly conditions demand basic protections on moral grounds—the crackdown on civil liberties that often comes in response is a terrible threat to American values and freedoms, and has left many stains on our history. I don't have to tell you that Trump seems particularly eager for such opportunities to come his way. His record speaks for itself. (See also his deployment of thousands of National Guard troops and some 700 Marines to Los Angeles in a show of force against protesters there.)

Back in Broderick and Terry's day, public revulsion over the duel ended Terry's political career—but not just that. His eagerness, and that of other defenders of slavery, to resort to violence doomed their cause. And so, among the several lessons that one might take from the bloody events of September 13, 1859, there is this: Nothing good can happen between two furious men pointing pistols at each other before dawn.

Also: If you believe in settling arguments with violence against those who disagree with you, you should expect to die that way.

And: If you look away while others resolve their differences violently, if you believe you can comfortably compartmentalize certain kinds of violence from a safe distance, you should expect to die for what you believe, too, because political violence does not stay contained or ideologically pure. Political violence has a way of perpetuating itself—feeding on itself, spilling ever more blood—until enough people are willing to say, “No more.”

Politicians often react to political violence by insisting that it is alien to our character, that it is not who we are. They are wrong. In just the three decades leading up to the Civil War, there were at least 70 violent skirmishes among members of Congress, according to Joanne Freeman, a scholar of political violence at Yale and the author of The Field of Blood: Violence in Congress and the Road to Civil War. That included the time when, in 1841, a brawl broke out in the U.S. House of Representatives; several members of Congress piled on top of one another, and others stood on tables. (One journalist who observed the fight described having seen several canes above the melee, “raised up as if in the act of striking.”) In 1850, Senator Henry Foote of Mississippi pulled a pistol on Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri on the Senate floor. (Benton was not one for de-escalation. He reportedly ripped open his shirt and shouted, “Let the assassin fire!” before onlookers successfully grabbed the pistol out of Foote's hands.)

The congressional pile-on of 1841, with all of those canes hoisted as weapons, calls to mind another infamous tremor of political violence that I've been thinking about lately. This particular incident happened three years before Broderick's death, on May 22, 1856. That day, Preston Brooks, a congressman from South Carolina, confronted Charles Sumner, a congressman from Massachusetts, over (once again) their differing views on slavery. Brooks owned slaves and wanted to keep it that way. Sumner was an abolitionist. So right there on the Senate floor, Brooks lifted his thick, metal-topped cane and beat Sumner until blood ran into his eyes and he slipped into unconsciousness. Brooks didn't stop beating him until the cane had broken apart into bloody pieces.

Today, people remember Brooks's attack for its terrible brutality and sheer pettiness. But in retrospect, one of its most terrifying aspects is not the violence itself—as horrible as it was—but what came next.

Sumner was permanently injured, and would spend years trying to regain basic functions. Brooks never apologized for what he did. He only doubled down. Yet after the attack, Brooks's many supporters in Congress took to wearing fragments of the broken cane, fashioned into rings that they strung around their necks, in a gruesome showing of solidarity. And then the people of South Carolina reelected him. They began to send him new canes, more than he could ever use, bearing inscriptions such as Hit Him Again and Good Job. This wasn't just tolerance of political violence, or forgiveness of it, but full-throated support.

Often, it is only when events recede into history that a society can see clearly what it has endured—and how close it has come to disaster. For generations, a portrait of Charles Sumner that hangs in the Capitol went mostly unnoticed. But on January 6, 2021, there it was in the background of photos showing the unthinkable: insurrectionists stalking the halls of the Capitol, 150 years after the end of the Civil War, waving the Confederate flag under Sumner's nose. The mass pardoning of those who attacked the U.S. Capitol is a clear message: Good job. Hit him again. 

Those pardons are also a signal to society that violence is in fact the way that we settle political differences in America. The president of the United States has made clear to the American people that when you want to get your way, you can do it however you want—whether with a Belgian pistol, or a cane, or the blunt end of a flagpole, or an AK-47 and a rubber mask on your neighbor's doorstep in the middle of the night.

It need not be this way. It should not be this way. But right now, it is. And it will get worse until Americans demand otherwise—from one another, from our elected officials, from ourselves. A society in which people resign to resolve their differences through bloodshed will eventually carry that logic to every possible argument, every small town, and every last household.

This is our national paradox. Political violence is deeply, inescapably American. It has been this way since the very beginning. The first recorded duel in the New World took place in 1621, not long after the landing at Plymouth. Our nation was born in a swirl of revolution and musket smoke, and episodes of political violence can be found in every decade since we declared our independence.

Yet for us to build the country we have promised ourselves, and that we have promised our children—for the guarantee of the very freedoms our fellow citizens have fought and died for—we must find a way for America to be America without killing one another over what we want this nation to be. We must insist on resolving political differences passionately but peacefully. We must return to power only those who believe in decency, honor, and dignity—not only for their political allies but for all Americans. Two centuries ago, Americans defended their honor through acts of violence against one another. Today, Americans should defend their honor through the courage to show restraint. It is too late for David Broderick, and for Bobby Kennedy, and for Martin Luther King Jr., and for Melissa Hortman, and for every other American who was ever lynched, executed, tortured, or killed for their beliefs. But it is not too late for this nation and its citizens to choose peace.

The health secretary has no plan for addressing the country's sleep problem.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

The MAHA diet is full of fussy advice: swap the seed oils for beef tallow, cut out the ultra-processed snacks and synthetic food dyes, slap on a continuous glucose monitor to track how your blood sugar fluctuates with each bite. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his “Make America healthy again” followers have such strong feelings about food because bad eating habits are making people sick. Many MAHA acolytes are equally particular about the need for a good night's sleep.



In their best-selling book, Good Energy, Casey and Calley Means, siblings who are both close Kennedy confidants, warn that even the best eating habits cannot make up for bad sleep: “You could eat a perfect ‘Good Energy' diet, but if you don't sleep, your cells will spew out excess free radicals.” (Casey is Donald Trump's surgeon-general nominee, and Calley is a special White House adviser.) Should the family dog be a nuisance at night, it may necessitate “intensive pet training or finding a new home,” they say. Other MAHA figures have similarly suggested making hard choices in the name of prioritizing sleep; Gary Brecka, a self-described biohacker who recently hosted Kennedy on his podcast, Ultimate Human, has recommended a $3,000 smart mattress cover. In typical MAHA fashion, some tips veer into the unscientific and even absurd. Mark Hyman, a longtime friend of Kennedy's who runs a wellness empire, has outlined a “simple sleep routine” that includes throwing away plug-in air fresheners, staying away from plastic food containers, and even building a Faraday cage over your bed to keep away electromagnetic waves.



Americans have been told over and over again to sleep more, with limited success. Nearly 40 percent of adults aren't getting enough rest, according to the CDC. The MAHA movement has good reasons to keep hounding the message. Poor sleep exacerbates many of the chronic conditions that the movement is focused on remedying. People who don't get enough shut-eye are at higher risk of heart disease and obesity. Even a week of sleep troubles can lead to glucose-processing issues similar to those experienced by people with type 2 diabetes. In May, the Trump administration's MAHA Commission published a long-awaited report on the causes of chronic disease among children; sleep is mentioned more than 20 times. (Calley Means apparently spearheaded the report.)



Read: Why can't Americans sleep?



When it comes to actual interventions and policies, however, sleep has been notably absent from the administration's planning. As health secretary, Kennedy has had some success cracking down on food dyes and enacting anti-vaccine policies, but he hasn't laid out anything close to a plan for addressing the country's sleep problem. The same can be said of state legislators who have been eager to implement MAHA policies. As a cause, sleep is a great illustration of MAHA's challenges: It's easy to make the point that Americans are unhealthy. It's much harder to actually fix it.



Kennedy seems less focused on sleep than other MAHA leaders are—something that goes back to before he was health secretary. He hasn't mentioned sleep in any speeches since being confirmed for his job. When asked about Kennedy's views on sleep, a Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson told me that “Secretary Kennedy supports a science-driven approach to health promotion, with an emphasis on raising awareness of lifestyle factors that contribute to long-term wellness.” There is good reason to think that RFK Jr. believes that sleep is an important part of improving America's health: He has suffered health scares in the past, partially due to sleep deprivation, and in response has prioritized getting more sleep, The New York Times reported last year.



His silence on sleep might have to do with the fact that a good night's rest is especially difficult to legislate. Sure, the government cannot take a cheeseburger out of someone's mouth, but it can do a lot to change food habits: tweaking what items can be purchased with food stamps, rewriting the rules for what is served in schools, putting warning labels on unhealthy foods, even banning certain ingredients. There isn't a similar playbook for sleep.



That's not to say there are no policies that could help. Take teens: Three-fourths of high schoolers do not get the recommended eight hours of sleep per night, according to the CDC. One of the key reasons is that their routine doesn't match with their biology. During puberty, adolescents naturally fall asleep and wake up later. This phenomenon, known as sleep-phase delay, is why first period is so tortuous for many high schoolers. Several sleep experts I spoke with suggested that school shouldn't start so early, which the Means siblings also endorse in their book. When Seattle's school district pushed its start time back by roughly an hour, students reported about 30 extra minutes of sleep per night. But Kennedy has little power to influence the education system. And even if he were to convince the Department of Education to endorse such a policy, states and localities would likely be the ones to implement such a change.



Coming up with policies to address sleep is all the more challenging because different groups are falling short on rest for different reasons. Some people are deprived of sleep because they live in loud or dangerous areas. Many people are staying up working—or late-night scrolling.  (We know of one president doing so, at least.)



The policy challenges might not stop RFK Jr. from lamenting America's sleep woes. After all, no health problem is straightforward, and Kennedy has advocated for several food changes that he doesn't have the power to implement as the head of HHS. Like Hyman, perhaps he could give a speech outlining his own sleep hacks. Maybe he could go the way of Brecka and promote gadgets that promise to improve sleep. (Last week, Kennedy declared that “wearables are a key to the MAHA agenda” and that he envisions every American wearing one within four years.) Or perhaps he, like the Means siblings, will just give Americans some hard truths about the importance of rest. The HHS secretary has shown himself to be an expert at riling crowds by channeling nostalgia for a bygone era, and America's sleep habits have gotten worse over the years. In 1942, 84 percent of adults were getting at least seven hours of sleep each night, according to a Gallup poll. By 2023, that number had dropped to 52 percent.



But sleep doesn't lend itself to a rallying cry in the way that other aspects of the MAHA agenda do. The movement's critiques of our poor diets have been so galvanizing because there is a clear enemy to organize around: the food industry. The same can be said of RFK Jr.'s anti-vaccine activism: Pharmaceutical companies make for an easy scapegoat, even though they aren't making products that cause autism. This process of determining the source of a problem and assigning blame is an essential part of any social movement, sociologists have suggested, and it is often what motivates action. If everyone was spending their nights tossing and turning on barbed-coil springs, perhaps a campaign could be waged against Big Mattress. But sleep is such a multifaceted problem that it's difficult to generate a single, unifying enemy.



That doesn't mean sleep is a losing issue for the MAHA universe. The fact that there's a market for $3,000 mattress pads demonstrates just how desperate people are for a solution to their sleep woes. But without articulating a clear theory for why Americans' sleep has suffered, anything Kennedy says about sleep will make him look less like a reformer and more like a self-help guru eager to sell another cure.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

To earn back the respect of Americans, the profession needs to return to its original principles.

Not so long ago, public health ranked high in the scientific pantheon. Its heroes—the conquerors of cholera, smallpox, yellow fever, and polio—were celebrated in history textbooks. When the coronavirus pandemic began more than five years ago, public-health leaders were revered by journalists and the public. Americans' bipartisan trust in scientists led millions of people to obey the unprecedented guidance in the spring of 2020 to remain in their homes.

But then, after the death of George Floyd, the rules suddenly changed—for some people. Isolating at home was no longer mandatory for those joining “protests against systemic racism,” according to an open letter signed by more than 1,200 academics, doctors, and public-health officials and released in early June. The signers acknowledged that leaders of their professions had previously condemned a street protest against lockdown policies—and they reaffirmed their opposition to such protests and other public gatherings. But the Black Lives Matter protests were different: “We support them as vital to the national public health.”

So it was now vital for thousands to march together in the streets, but you still couldn't take your child to a playground or gather with family in a cemetery to bury your grandmother? Or march in protest of anything except racism? This made no sense, especially to conservatives, whose skepticism kept growing as COVID restrictions proliferated in blue states. By the time the pandemic ended, a survey had found that more than half of Republicans had little or no confidence that “science has had a mostly positive effect on society.” To them, the public-health establishment's guidance on such topics as childhood vaccines and fluoridated water now seemed less about the science than the politics.

Listen: Who really protests, and why?

Although many skeptics have overreacted, rejecting sound science in favor of quack theories, they've gotten one thing right: A noble profession has been corrupted by politics. This became obvious during the pandemic, but the politicization of the discipline has been going on for half a century. The modern field has redefined the very meaning of public health, and in the process, it has made so many mistakes that it has itself become a hazard to Americans' health.

The pioneers of public health focused on threats that were genuinely public: epidemics that spread through the water and the air. Halting the spread of cholera and smallpox required collective action, and the government had clear scientific justification to provide clean water, build sewer systems, and sponsor vaccination campaigns. In addressing diseases caused by unhealthy personal behavior, leaders mostly urged public education, not governmental coercion. The surgeon general's landmark 1964 report on smoking cataloged the evidence of its harm but avoided policy prescriptions. In a congressional hearing that year, the president of the American Cancer Society rejected the notion of banning smoking: “We believe in the freedom of the individual in the matter of cigarette smoking.”

But the distinction between public and personal health began disappearing in the 1960s. Public health was undone, in part, by its success. As they conquered one scourge after another, practitioners began looking for new missions and expanding the definition of epidemic. Over the ensuing decades, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, founded in the 1940s to stop the spread of malaria, enlarged its portfolio to address epidemics of tobacco use, firearm fatalities, domestic violence, and racism. The American Public Health Association began campaigning to regulate products it deemed unhealthy, and went on to support income redistribution, nationalized health care, increases to the minimum wage, green energy, and transgender rights.

The field's transformation was summarized in the title of a book published in 2000 by the economists James T. Bennett and Thomas J. DiLorenzo: From Pathology to Politics. “To a very large extent,” the authors concluded, “the public health movement has increasingly become a collection of liberal ideologies cloaked in the language and garb of health science.” Public health was redefined not merely as the absence of disease but as the presence of social justice, the pursuit of which became a major part of the curriculum in public-health schools. Unhealthy personal choices were recast as public hazards requiring new government interventions.

To combat heart disease and obesity, senators and advocacy groups pressed for federal dietary guidelines in 1980 telling Americans to eat less fat and more carbohydrates. Eminent nutrition researchers objected, arguing that hypotheses linking the diseases to dietary fat were too tenuous to justify the move. These researchers would eventually be vindicated by rigorous studies that failed to demonstrate the purported benefits of low-fat diets—and that revealed harms from carbohydrate-rich diets.

But such scientists were no match for their political opponents. Politicians and journalists portrayed them as outliers and tools of the food industry, because it had funded some of their research. The federal government went on recommending a low-fat diet and issued the now-infamous food pyramid promoting carbs. As the American food industry and public followed that advice, substituting carbs for fats, rates of obesity and diabetes soared.

Undeterred by that fiasco, the federal government issued more guidelines in 2005, telling Americans to adopt a low-salt diet and consume no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium daily. It set an even lower limit for middle-age and older people—1,500 milligrams—which meant cutting out more than half of the sodium in a typical diet. Once again, some scientists said that there was no evidence to justify this experiment on the public. They were dismissed as outliers and industry shills, but their concerns, too, were subsequently taken up by other scientists: Large studies found that low-salt diets were actually associated with higher rates of heart disease, stroke, and death than diets with moderate amounts of sodium. The government eventually removed the draconian limit for older adults. But it has continued recommending the 2,300-milligram limit for the general population, which critics say is still unwarranted—and quite possibly harmful—because there's little evidence that a low-salt diet would benefit people who do not have high blood pressure.

With the transformation of the profession, smoking was no longer defensible on the grounds of individual freedom. Bans on smoking in outdoor spaces, private workplaces, and restaurants were justified with overhyped claims about the deadly perils of secondhand smoke. (Later, when a rigorous study found no link between secondhand smoke and lung cancer, the bans were retroactively justified as a way to “change societal behavior” by “denormalizing” smoking.) Prohibitionists in the U.S. sought not merely a “smoke-free society” but also a “tobacco-free society,” which meant eliminating any form of nicotine, even the safer alternatives to cigarettes being encouraged by authorities in other countries. In Britain, the Royal College of Physicians noted that “nicotine itself is not especially hazardous” and warned that it would be “unjust, irrational and immoral” not to offer alternatives to cigarettes that could save the lives of millions of smokers. In 2015, England's public-health agency published a study that found nicotine vaping to be an effective tool for quitting that eliminated around 95 percent of the harms of smoking.

In the U.S., the smoking rate among adults and youths declined sharply after nicotine vaping started growing rapidly in 2010, but you wouldn't have guessed it from the reaction of officials at the CDC and the FDA. They launched a campaign against vaping, imposing strict new regulations and seizing on weak evidence to issue warnings of potential dangers. In 2014, the director of the CDC, Tom Frieden (who had risen to national prominence as New York City's health commissioner by crusading against fat, salt, and smoking), warned that vaping could “do more harm than good” by luring young people to smoke cigarettes. But smoking rates among youths and adults have continued declining—and other potential dangers have been soundly debunked too.

As usual, the few scientists challenging the narrative have been mostly ignored (and denounced) by their colleagues and the media. Polls in recent years show that three-quarters of Americans wrongly believe that vaping is equally as or more dangerous than smoking—and some of them are smokers who have been dissuaded from using a singularly effective tool for quitting.

The most egregious errors, of course, came during the coronavirus pandemic. Before the first outbreaks began, the CDC had drawn up a pandemic plan incorporating the old-school public-health principles of Donald Henderson, the epidemiologist who had directed the worldwide campaign that eradicated smallpox in the 1960s and '70s. In 2006, he and his colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh analyzed possible responses to an influenza pandemic, including bans on public gatherings, lengthy closures of schools, travel restrictions, and the universal wearing of surgical masks. The researchers did not recommend any of those responses, pointing to evidence that they would be ineffective, and warned that “if particular measures are applied for many weeks or months, the long-term or cumulative second- and third-order effects could be devastating socially and economically.” The article urged public-health officials to not put too much faith in computer models. It stressed the need for leaders to “provide reassurance” and reduce the public's anxiety by maintaining “the normal social functioning of the community.”

In its pre-2020 pandemic-planning scenarios, the CDC didn't recommend business closures or mask wearing by healthy individuals, even if a virus were as deadly as the 1918 flu. But once China claimed that its lockdown had stopped the virus, the CDC plan was abruptly abandoned. Instead of reassuring the public, leaders presented doomsday scenarios (based on wildly unrealistic computer projections) that terrified everyone, especially young people, who were actually at a much lower risk of death than the rest of the population. Instead of following the pre-pandemic advice of its own scientists, the CDC copied China's lockdown.

Why did the public-health establishment want to believe, much less emulate, China's authoritarian rulers? The sudden enthusiasm for lockdowns has sometimes been blamed on the profession's partisan bias: If Donald Trump opposed lockdowns, Democrats assumed, they must be a good idea, and the economic damage wouldn't seem quite so catastrophic if it prevented him from being reelected that year. The idea that the pandemic might discredit Trump even prompted Jane Fonda to describe COVID as “God's gift to the Left.”

But there was more to it than just election-year politics. The pandemic was also God's gift to the ambitious social engineers who had come to dominate public-health discourse. For decades, abetted by journalists eager for scare stories, these scientists and activists had been gaining prestige, power, and funding by declaring new menaces that could be conquered only by following their expert guidance, and they had become adept at silencing researchers who questioned their version of “the science.”

Early in the pandemic, a few prominent researchers echoed Henderson's warning that the unprecedented restrictions on liberty were not justified by the scientific literature and could cause much more harm than the virus. But these researchers—including Harvard's Martin Kulldorff and Stanford's John Ioannidis, Jay Bhattacharya, and Scott Atlas—were promptly vilified by colleagues, smeared in the press, and censored on social-media platforms. Other researchers became afraid to openly challenge the establishment, so the officials promoting lockdowns became the public face of scientific authority.

And then the mask came off. The dispensation for the Black Lives Matter protests was so nakedly ideological that COVID policies became an intensely partisan issue. Red states began reopening while blue states remained shut, mandated masks, and kept schools closed long after they had reopened in the rest of America and in Europe. For some, wearing a mask became a political statement—the Democratic version of a MAGA hat. Blue-state governors and the Biden administration adopted some of the world's most aggressive policies, such as the CDC's recommendation (which was partially rescinded only last month) that everyone over the age of six months be vaccinated against COVID. In much of Europe, health agencies never recommended the vaccine for healthy children under 5, required those young children to wear masks, or mandated vaccines for people with natural immunity. In 2022 and 2023, many European agencies stopped recommending booster shots for most healthy people under 60, but the CDC still recommends the shots for everyone over 18—and still advises parents to consider vaccinating infants and children.

Read: How public health took part of its own downfall

American public-health officials eventually acknowledged having made a few mistakes, such as not reopening schools sooner, but they've mostly ignored the evidence that their response to the coronavirus pandemic was the worst debacle in the history of their profession, and arguably the costliest federal-policy blunder ever made in peacetime. Just as Donald Henderson had warned, lockdowns and other restrictions caused devastating economic and social damage while proving largely futile as a means of controlling the virus.

Many studies comparing mortality rates across the United States and Europe have concluded that lockdowns and other restrictions made little or no difference in reducing COVID mortality. Clinical trials of masks failed to show they were effective, and the rates of COVID infections and deaths in states with mask mandates were virtually identical to the rates in no-mandate states throughout the pandemic. Sweden, initially pilloried for refusing to lock down and for advising its citizens not to wear masks, ended the pandemic with one of the lowest rates in Europe of cumulative excess mortality.

The public's lingering anger over COVID restrictions helped reelect Trump, who has brought two COVID heretics into the administration: Bhattacharya, the new director of the National Institutes of Health, and Marty Makary of Johns Hopkins, the new FDA commissioner. During their confirmation hearings, they vowed to make sweeping reforms and lamented Americans' loss of faith in public-health institutions. During the pandemic, both had warned that the mandates for COVID vaccines were excessive and would make Americans leery of all vaccines. Sure enough, a Gallup poll found that the percentage of Americans who say vaccinating their children is “extremely important” fell from nearly 60 percent before the pandemic to just 40 percent last year.

To regain the public's trust, both researchers promised senators that they would restore scientific rigor and debate at their agencies, but they clearly have their work cut out for them. Their agencies not only still have plenty of ambitious progressives in the ranks but also are now overseen by a particularly avid social engineer, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of Health and Human Services and leader of the “Make America healthy again” movement. He wants to restrict seed oils, ultra-processed foods, pesticides, and other products that he considers unhealthy. Critics are already warning that the scientific rationales for these moves are so weak that his public-health campaign, like previous ones, could make Americans less healthy.

But RFK Jr. seems determined to continue in his predecessors' footsteps, and he has even discovered yet another epidemic. “Anti-Semitism—like racism—is a spiritual and moral malady that sickens societies and kills people with lethalities comparable to history's most deadly plagues,” he declared, in announcing a task force to combat it. Yes, anti-Semitism is deadly, and you can call it a plague, but that doesn't mean scientists have the expertise to conquer it.

The public-health profession can go on pretending it knows how to cure every social ill, but it will never earn back the public's respect unless it returns to its original principles. It needs to choose evidence over ideology—and humility over hubris.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The push to strip non-native Americans of citizenship echoes a dark chapter in American history.

President Donald Trump is reviving a familiar playbook to target naturalized US citizens. 

The Justice Department recently announced a new push to strip certain people of their citizenship through denaturalization proceedings. Individuals who pose a danger to national security, have committed violent crimes, or fail to disclose a felony history (or make other misrepresentations) on their citizenship application are among those now being prioritized for denaturalization and deportation. In doing so, the administration is likely seeking to expand an authority that the Supreme Court drastically limited decades ago. 

The president and White House officials have suggested that some prominent denaturalization targets could include one-time Trump megadonor Elon Musk, with whom the president had a public falling out, and Zohran Mamdani, a progressive who recently won the Democratic nomination for mayor of New York City. It's not clear, however, what legitimate grounds the administration might have to denaturalize either of them.

The news may rattle any of the estimated 24.5 million naturalized citizens currently living in the US. That might especially be the case for those who have voiced opposition to Trump, given that his administration has already weaponized immigration policy against dissidents.

Ostensibly, denaturalization is about protecting the integrity of the citizenship process. In practice, the new push “is about targeting speech the government doesn't like, and it is chilling all naturalized citizens,” said Amanda Frost, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law and author of You Are Not American: Citizenship Stripping From Dred Scott to the Dreamers.

This wouldn't be the first time denaturalization has been used as a tool of political repression. During the Red Scare following World War II, the US pursued denaturalization cases with an eye toward rooting out un-American behavior, both real and perceived.

Scholars now see echoes of that era in Trump's strategy.

“There's increasing rhetoric of trying to take people's citizenship away for political reasons,” said Cassandra Burke Robinson, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law who has studied denaturalization. “I think any time you treat that as even a possibility to be considered, you're going down a really dangerous slope.”

In the 1950s and 1960s, fears about the spread of communism took hold of the US. A political movement known as McCarthyism — named after then-Senator Joseph McCarthy — sought to purge anyone in government with connections to the Communist Party. Denaturalization was one of the tools McCarthyites relied on, and, at the height of the movement, the US was denaturalizing more than 20,000 people per year, Burke Robinson said.

In these cases, the government argued that if an individual became a member of the Communist Party at any time, that person had been lying when taking an oath of allegiance to the US as part of their citizenship test and, therefore, could be denaturalized. Later, that argument evolved to target Americans with disfavored political views or who were perceived as disloyal to the US more broadly, not just Communist Party members.

One of the primary targets of denaturalization were members of the German American Bund, the American Nazi organization. However, targets also included political gadflies, such as labor leaders, journalists, and anarchists.

“Those whose speech the government didn't like could get removed, and everyone else could stay. They used their discretion in this area to accomplish that goal,” Frost said.

Among those targeted for denaturalization was the Australian-born labor leader Harry Bridges, who led longshoremen strikes in California. He accepted support from the Communist Party as part of his union activities, but the government never found evidence that he was a member himself. The notorious House Un-American Activities Committee investigated Bridges, and the government sought his deportation and, once he became a citizen, denaturalization, but never succeeded.

Denaturalizations decreased significantly, from tens of thousands to fewer than 10 annually, after the Supreme Court's 1967 decision in Afroyim v. Rusk. In that case, the justices found that the US government does not have the power to denaturalize people without their consent because citizenship is guaranteed by the Constitution's 14th Amendment. 

“They said you could only lose your citizenship if you very explicitly renounce,” Frost said. “The United States government governs with the consent of the citizens. It's not allowed to choose its citizens.”

For decades, the ruling meant that denaturalization was a rare phenomenon. However, the court included an exception for cases in which citizenship is “unlawfully procured” — meaning they were not eligible for citizenship in the first place due to acts like committing war crimes. That's what Trump is now relying on to revive the tactic. 

Denaturalizations have been increasing since the Obama administration, when the digitization of naturalization records made it easier to identify individuals whose citizenship applications showed discrepancies with other government records. Most denaturalization cases during this period involved people who had committed acts of terrorism or war crimes.

But Trump made denaturalization a priority during his first administration, including targeting anyone who merely had errors on their naturalization papers. The DOJ launched a new section focused on denaturalization and investigated some 700,000 naturalized citizens, resulting in 168 active denaturalization cases — more than under any other modern president. It's not clear how many of them were ultimately denaturalized and deported. 

Trump is now picking up where he left off. The administration has said that it will pursue these denaturalization cases in civil rather than criminal court proceedings. In such proceedings, individuals are not entitled to an attorney, and the legal bar for the administration to prove that a citizen did something to warrant denaturalization is lower than it would be in criminal court. There is also no limit on how long after naturalization the government can seek to revoke someone's citizenship.

All of that raises due process concerns. 

“Somebody might not know about the proceedings against them. There might be a good defense that they're not able to offer. There's no right to an attorney,” Burke Robinson said. “It seems to me to be really problematic.”

There's also the question of to what degree this Supreme Court will be willing to rein in Trump's denaturalization efforts. Its 2017 decision in Maslenjak v. United States maintained a high bar for denaturalization: The court found that an alleged misstatement in a Bosnian refugee's citizenship paperwork could not have kept them from becoming a citizen, even if it had been discovered before their naturalization, and could not be used as grounds to denaturalize them in criminal proceedings.

That makes Burke Robinson “somewhat hopeful that the court does take the issue very seriously.” 

“But that was 2017,” she added. “It is a different court now, so it's very hard to predict.”

Sprawl made the American Sunbelt affordable. Now it's breaking it.

For the last half-century, America's population growth has been concentrated in the sweltering, equal parts bone-dry and waterlogged, yet ever-sprawling Sunbelt. Undeterred by the limits of hydrology or climate, metro areas from Las Vegas to Miami have gotten one thing undeniably right. They have long led the country in housing construction, resulting in a relative plenitude and affordability that shames coastal cities in California and the Northeast, as well as a booming industry of takes imploring blue cities to learn from red states on housing.

But that abundance is already becoming a thing of the past. Across Sunbelt metros like Phoenix, Dallas, and Atlanta, housing supply growth has actually plummeted since the early 2000s, to rates almost as low as in hyper-expensive coastal cities, according to a new working paper by the leading urban economists Edward Glaeser and Joe Gyourko. Housing costs in these metros, while still lower than major coastal cities, have surged as a result. 

Gyourko, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School who decades ago documented slowing housing growth in superstar cities like New York and San Francisco, told me he was surprised to find the same pattern again unfolding, as if on a 20-year lag, in a region known for its lax regulations and enthusiasm for building things. Looking at the data, he thought, “Wow, Phoenix and Miami look like LA did as it was gentrifying in the '80s.” 

Although metro Phoenix, to unpack one example, is building a similar absolute number of homes as it did in the early 2000s, its population has grown by more than 58 percent since the turn of the century, so as a share of its current housing stock — the number that most matters, Gyourko says — it's now building far less. If that trend continues even as demand to live in the Sunbelt remains undimmed, he said, “you would expect them to start to look more and more like Los Angeles.” By 2045, Arizona might be facing unaffordability and population loss crises much like those choking California today. 

For many years, suburbs and exurbs have been the leading drivers of housing growth in Sunbelt cities, capturing most of the new population moving to the region. “The concepts ‘Sunbelt city' and ‘suburb' are nearly synonymous,” as historian Becky Nicolaides put it. But the slowdown in new housing builds across the region, Glaeser and Gyourko found, has been especially pronounced in well-off, low-density suburbs with desirable amenities like good schools. These suburbs have plenty of room to densify and welcome more neighbors — they just aren't doing it. 

“America's suburban frontier,” the authors warn, “appears to be closing.” 

The findings suggest that the fundamentals of housing in Raleigh, Orlando, or Miami are not so different from every other hot real estate market in the country. In most parts of the US with a growing economy and good jobs, the housing market has become badly broken to a degree that transcends the usual explanations, like regional differences in construction licensure rules or environmental review requirements — although those factors, without a doubt, matter. 

So what's really going on? Housing markets are complicated, and economic shocks like the Great Recession and the recent spike in interest rates have surely played a role. But the downturn in housing builds predates both those things, Glaeser and Gyourko found, suggesting a deeper cause. The Sunbelt may be confronting the same obstacle that has paralyzed growth elsewhere. It's one of the most taken-for-granted facts of modern American life: the suburban model itself, and all its attendant political, regulatory, and financial problems. 

Since the end of World War II, housing supply growth in the United States has overwhelmingly been driven by suburban sprawl radiating ever outward from city centers. Instead of building up, with density, we largely built out. But that engine may be running out of steam — and as a strategy for filling our national housing shortage, it's failing spectacularly. 

“It hasn't been working in the supply-constrained coastal markets for four decades. What's new is it looks like it's starting not to work in the Sunbelt,” the country's fastest-growing, most economically dynamic region, Gyourko said. “That changes the nature of America.” 

The strangeness of housing policy in the US can be summed up like this: On a national level, we long for growth. On a local level, we do everything possible to smother it. That contradiction stems, in part, from our dependence on sprawl. 

America is a nation of suburbs — that's certainly not changing any time soon. And there's nothing inherently wrong with suburbs, a housing arrangement as old and varied as human civilization. But to solve the housing crisis that is at the root of so many national problems, Americans will have to fundamentally rethink what the suburb is, and what it could become. 

If you, like me, are too online for your own good, perhaps you've seen some version of this meme. 

That image is a pretty accurate reflection of what American cities used to look like by default. Our suburbs, too, once looked much like this — remnants of the pattern can still be seen in places like Oak Park, Illinois (a suburb of Chicago), University City, Missouri (outside St. Louis), or Brookline, Massachusetts (neighboring Boston). Derived from the Latin word “suburbium,” meaning the area under or near a city, suburbs are so old that if you've ever thought about them, congratulations, you've been thinking about the Roman Empire. 

Of course, what dense, older suburbs like Brookline or Oak Park have in common is that, like the cities they neighbor, they were largely laid out before mass car ownership. It was only relatively recently that suburbs became synonymous with a specific, car- and sprawl-oriented development style. 

If the Western frontier defined American optimism in the 19th century, the suburban frontier defined it in the 20th. It's a story you may already know in broad strokes: Before World War II, only a small share of Americans lived in suburbs, with the bulk living in rural areas and central cities. After the war, a complex alchemy of factors — including a national economic and population boom, federally backed mortgages that favored suburban homes, a Great Depression- and war-era housing shortage, and white flight — produced one of the greatest social and spatial transformations in the country's history.

It would be easy, from our 21st-century perspective, to simply be bewildered by the urban planning decisions that fueled this wave of suburbanization. But those choices make a lot more sense when framed by the daily realities of mid-century urban life. Much of the prewar urban housing stock was genuinely terrible — many people lacked access to a full bathroom or even a flush toilet. Cities were still manufacturing centers and had the pollution to go with it. Americans who could afford to move were understandably pulled toward modern, spacious houses being built on an unprecedented scale in new tracts outside the city.

As this shift took place, the nature of the suburbs changed, from an organic extension of the city to what must have looked, to some at the time, like an alien planet. By 1970, most Americans dwelling in metropolitan areas — meaning a core city and its adjacent areas — were living in suburbs, and by 2010, most Americans were, full stop. Sunbelt cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas, which in the decades after World War II grew from little more than desert towns to megacities, developed in a particularly suburban, car-dependent form. 

For a long time, that model worked well for a lot of people. But there was a problem that slowly made itself felt: Though they were themselves the product of a major transformation, postwar American suburbia relied on a restrictive set of rules that made suburban neighborhoods, once built, very difficult to change. Irrationally rigid regulations on housing remain in place across the country today. If you live in a single-family home, there's a very good chance you're banned from dividing your house into a duplex, redeveloping it into a triplex or apartment building, renting out a floor to a tenant, or opening a corner store. 

These rules are set out by a system known as zoning: local regulations on what kind of things can be built where. Zoning, including single-family-exclusive zoning, first spread across the US in the early 20th century (before that, development was far more freewheeling and improvised). It reached its full expression after World War II, when it became a near-universal toolkit for shaping suburban America. 

At first glance, the idea of zoning seems reasonable enough: Factories that emit toxic pollutants should probably be kept away from residential areas, for example. In practice, it has amounted to an extraordinarily heavy-handed, totalizing form of central planning controlling the fabric of daily life. 

The overwhelming majority of residential land nationwide, as housing advocates are fond of saying, bans the construction of anything other than detached single-family houses — and that's just the beginning. Zoning codes include legions of other rules, often including minimum size requirements (effectively banning starter homes) and mandatory parking spots for at least two cars. Apartments, in many areas, are zoned out of existence.

Suburbs exist all over the world. But the US, despite our national reputation for freedom and individualism, is relatively unique in having such a prescriptive segregation of land uses governing what people are allowed to do with what is, don't forget, their own property, as Sonia Hirt, an architecture and planning professor at the University of Georgia, explains in her book Zoned in the USA. 

We're also unusual in granting privileged status to one specific, costly, and resource-intensive type of housing. “I could find no evidence in other countries that this particular form — the detached single-family home — is routinely, as in the United States, considered to be so incompatible with all other types of urbanization as to warrant a legally defined district all its own, a district where all other major land uses and building types are outlawed,” Hirt writes. 

Suburban-style zoning has become widespread not just in suburbs proper, but also in core cities, many of which have adopted similar zoning codes that would have made their original growth and housing diversity impossible. 

In that sense, suburbia isn't just a specific place — it's a mindset that's become the default American settlement pattern. For mid-century home buyers, the costs of our suburban revolution were distant. But it didn't take long for those costs to become felt nationally. 

By rigidly defining what a community is allowed to look like, suburban zoning has done more than simply shape the physical form of our cities. It has also made it all but impossible for many communities to adapt and grow, as human societies always have, which has created severe distortions in housing markets. 

“The suburban development model is built on the premise of stasis,” as Charles Marohn, a civil engineer and founder of the advocacy group Strong Towns, has put it. “These neighborhoods are frozen at their current number of households, no matter how much the surrounding city transforms. No matter how many jobs are created. No matter how desirable the area is or how high rents get,” he wrote in his recent book Escaping the Housing Trap.

That stasis quickly froze America's most desirable metro areas, leaving them unable to build enough housing to meet demand. And when housing becomes scarce relative to the number of people who want to live in the community, it simply becomes more expensive. 

Starting in the 1970s, home construction plummeted and prices soared in high-opportunity coastal cities because of restrictions on supply. Los Angeles, incredibly, downzoned its residential areas to such an extent between 1960 and 1990 that its total population capacity, as measured by the number of households it's zoned to accommodate, declined from 10 million people to about 4 million, which is the level the city's population has hovered around for the last decade. 

The upshot is that many of America's metropolitan areas have become dominated by what economist Issi Romem identified in 2018 as a “dormant suburban interior.” After World War II, cities and suburbs built out and out, mostly low-density single-family homes, before they largely stopped building altogether because zoning laws forced them to maintain an inflexible suburban form. Despite a few pockets of dense growth, most residential areas have been locked out of building incrementally and thickening up, even as demand to live there increases. 

When a high-demand city refuses to allow greater housing density, the dynamic becomes progressively more toxic, not just because homes become more scarce, but also because market incentives can push developers to replace cheaper, smaller single-family houses with more costly McMansions (as opposed to, in a healthier market, building apartments or a set of townhomes that could house more people in the same amount of space, for less money per household). 

In expensive cities, proposals to build more housing have, famously, often been blocked by angry neighbors (derisively called NIMBYs) who rely on a labyrinthine tangle of zoning laws to foil change that they don't like. Now, that vicious cycle is poised to catch up with the South and Southwest, where, Glaeser and Gyourko believe, the decline in housing starts is likely a function of incumbent residents using regulation to make it harder to build. 

“People in the Sunbelt, now that things have gotten big enough, they've figured out what the Bostonians figured out a long time ago, and the Angelenos,” Gyourko said. (And plenty of anecdotal evidence from local housing fights in the Sunbelt, Slate reporter Henry Grabar has noted, points to the same thing.)

Suburbia offered Americans an implicit bargain: Neighborhoods would never have to change, and we could instead accommodate more people by sprawling outward forever. To a great extent, that's what's happened, and it's given us lots of single-family homes, but also a mind-boggling expanse of costly, deteriorating infrastructure, nightmare commutes, unrestrained greenhouse gas emissions, sedentary, disease-promoting lifestyles, and one of the highest car crash death rates in the developed world. 

And we're still in a housing crisis, because even in the sprawl-hardened, car-loving Southwest, sprawl has its limits. I put this question to Gyourko: Once the most distant, low-density exurbs of, say, Dallas declare themselves full, why don't developers simply keep building the next ring of sprawl 50-plus miles away? “People don't want to live that far,” he said (he later clarified that we don't know the precise outer limit beyond which housing demand dwindles). Human prosperity has always depended on proximity to one another and to opportunity — and even in 2025, it still does. 

The US has gotten steadily more suburban over the last century, but not uniformly so. In the early 2010s, many core cities, including Denver, Atlanta, and Washington, DC, grew faster than suburbs, due to a combination of younger generations' increasing interest in urban lifestyles and a collapse in suburban home construction after the Great Recession. 

Some of the most expensive homes in the country are consistently those located in dense, vibrant prewar cities, a clear signal that there's high demand for those amenities. The revival of cities in the last few decades and the ongoing suburbanization of the US, Gyourko said, have both been happening at the same time. 

Nevertheless, many Americans today, particularly post-Covid, still demonstrate a preference for the suburbs, for all sorts of reasons, including cheaper, larger homes for families of the kind that can be hard to find in cities. Americans are also spending more time alone and at home, and working remotely, which might increase their preference for spacious living quarters and diminish interest in urban life. 

“There's a pendulum that swings between loving the city and loving the suburbs, and it was absolutely shifting towards loving the city” in the 2010s, Romem told me. “And then the pandemic came and undid all of that.” 

The disruptions of Covid also revealed the fragility created by American-style urban planning. Because of our preexisting shortage of about 3.8 million homes, a small share of Americans moving residences upended housing markets across the country. 

Plenty of cities and states, especially since the post-2020 run-up in home prices, have finally begun to take their largely self-inflicted housing shortages seriously. “A bunch of broken policies that seemed unfixable a year ago are actively being fixed,” said M. Nolan Gray of California YIMBY. 

The sheer volume of new laws meant to make it easier to build homes has been overwhelming, reflecting the morass of local obstacles. Here are just a few:

If it sounds draconian for states to interfere in cities' and suburbs' policies, consider that the US is unusual in its hyperlocal control over housing. Although huge barriers remain, we're just beginning to see the contours of a major shift in how housing in America gets regulated and built. 

Skyrocketing housing prices since the pandemic have given new fuel to the YIMBY (or “Yes in my backyard”) movement, which for more than a decade has sought to legalize the full diversity of housing options across the US. At bottom, YIMBYism is about freeing cities and suburbs from “the zoning straitjacket,” as M. Nolan Gray, an urban planner and senior director of legislation and research for the housing advocacy nonprofit California YIMBY, put it. In other words, he said: “Let people do things.”

“A city is the ultimate form of emergent order. A city represents the plans of the millions of people who live there and work there and play there and study there,” he said. “The basic instinct of zoning is that we can sit down and write out the exact appropriate types of uses, scale of those uses, and exactly where those uses can go — and it's just such a presumptuous way to govern a city.” 

The deeper implication is not just that we need more housing, but also that suburbs must be allowed to function like the miniature cities they are. They should be flexible enough to support a range of human aspirations — not just the hallmarks of stereotypical suburban life, but also the amenities of urban life. “No neighborhood can be exempt from change,” as Marohn put it. 

Zoning exclusively for detached single-family homes, for example, has never made much sense, but it especially doesn't make sense in 2025, when most Americans live in household sizes of two or one. Recognizing this, along with the severity of their housing crises, a number of cities and states have gotten rid of single-family-exclusive zoning in the last decade, along with other barriers to building housing. But because zoning codes are enormously complicated, repealing one barrier often isn't enough to actually allow multifamily housing to get built — things like height limits or excessive parking minimums can still make it infeasible. 

“Housing is like a door with a bunch of deadbolts on it,” Alli Thurmond Quinlan, an architect and small-scale developer based in Fayetteville, Arkansas, told me. “You have to unlock all the deadbolts, but as soon as you do, there's an enormous amount of human creativity” that rushes in. She stresses that communities shouldn't be afraid of going too far in repealing zoning rules, and that if anything, they should err on the side of going further. 

Repeal minimum lot sizes, and a developer might find a way to build a cute narrow house in a gap between existing houses. Removing parking requirements made it possible to build this lovely set of densely clustered cottages — a development style that can blend harmoniously into suburban neighborhoods — in Atlanta at a significantly lower cost: 

A single-family house, meanwhile, can be turned into a duplex: 

Right now, what little density is being added to cities and suburbs often comes in the form of large apartment buildings (you may know them as “gentrification buildings”). There's nothing wrong with those, and they have an important role to play in mitigating the housing shortage. Yet many people don't want them built in single-family neighborhoods. Making it legal to incrementally densify single-family neighborhoods would allow suburbs to still look like suburbs, while greatly increasing their population capacity and their ability to support essential services like public transit. 

“The dormant suburban sea is so vast that if the taboo on densification there were broken, even modest gradual redevelopment — tearing down one single-family home at a time and replacing it with a duplex or a small apartment building — could grow the housing stock immensely,” Romem wrote in 2018. 

That style of neighborhood development — gradually over time, rather than building to completion all at once — also happens to be the secret to creating places with a visually appealing vernacular character, Romem said. “True character comes from layer upon layer over a span of many years, from many people's different, disparate decisions. And that requires change.” 

At the dawn of mass suburbanization, Americans had legitimate reasons for wanting to move out of cities, where substandard housing and overcrowding were still commonplace. But “one generation's solutions can become the next generation's problems,” as journalists Ezra Klein (a Vox co-founder) and Derek Thompson wrote in their book Abundance. The same forces that built the American dream 80 years ago are now suffocating it, inflicting profound pain on families across the country. 

For me, this subject is personal: I've lived in apartments literally my entire life, a form of housing often treated as second-class, if it's even permitted to exist. Some of that has been in cities, and some in a suburb. My immigrant mother worked incredibly hard to find homes that were safe, stable, and affordable to raise a child in. America gave me everything, but our national housing reality made things far more difficult for her than they needed to be. 

There's no shortage of wonky policy ideas about how to fix housing in the US — and they go far beyond just zoning codes (you don't want to hear me get started on building codes or impact fees). We will also need a society-wide paradigm shift beyond policy: The financial and real estate industries will need to relearn models for supporting incremental densification, which, experts consistently told me, have fallen by the wayside since the entrenchment of sprawl and restrictive zoning. 

More than that, our minds will have to open up to the inevitability of constant change, and abandon the idea that any of us has a right to veto our community's evolution. As Marohn points out in Escaping the Housing Trap, “a community that has lost all affordable starter housing already has changed irreversibly. It is only the buildings that have not.” 

The suburbs, above all, must be allowed to be plural. Across cultures and centuries, people of all sorts of circumstances have lived on the outskirts of urban life. Today, Americans of every social class seek homes in the suburbs. Some are affluent; many are not. Others want to be near a good school, a job, a support system, or simply a hard-won foothold of affordability. It's not the role of a planning board or a legacy zoning map to decide. We don't know what the future of the suburbs will be — but we can free them to become what we need of them.

﻿Meditation feels selfish when the world is on fire.

Your Mileage May Vary is an advice column offering you a unique framework for thinking through your moral dilemmas. To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form or email sigal.samuel@vox.com. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity:

I graduate college soon, and like everyone around me, I'm working hard to find a job. But unlike those around me, I have a sense for how inactivity enlivens me — I get lots of joy from silence, reflection, and complete agency over my mind. I've quit most social media, and I got into meditation a while ago and never looked back. This awareness makes me tilt towards a life that optimizes for this. But I also have very altruistic leanings, which could become serious scruples if I don't do good in the world.

Should I be trying to balance the pursuit of two seemingly opposed life goals — pursuing true happiness through inactivity and contemplation (as hypothesized by thinkers like Aristotle and Byung-Chul Han) and striving to do good in the world through robust goal-oriented action? The first is indifferent to which ends (if any) one's life contributes to, as long as it is blanketed in leisurely contemplation and true inactivity. The second invites and rewards behaviors that are constantly opposed to prolonged inactivity (working efficiently, constantly learning, etc). So I really don't know how to handle this.

Dear Contemplative and Caring, 

Matthieu Ricard is known as the “world's happiest man.” When he lay down in an MRI scanner so scientists could look at his brain, they saw that the regions associated with happiness were exploding with activity, while those associated with negative emotions were nearly silent. The scientists were stunned. How did his brain get that way?

The answer: 60,000 hours of meditation. See, Ricard grew up in France, earned a PhD in genetics, and then, at age 26, abandoned a bright scientific career in favor of going to Tibet. He became a Buddhist monk and spent nearly three decades training his mind in love and compassion. The result was that one stupendously joyous brain.

But what if he'd instead spent 60,000 hours bringing joy to other people?

Philosopher Peter Singer once put this question to Ricard, basically asking if it was self-indulgent to spend so much time in a hermitage when there are problems in the world that urgently need fixing. Ricard gave a complex answer, and I think looking at all three components of it will be helpful to you.

Feel free to email me at sigal.samuel@vox.com or fill out this anonymous form! Newsletter subscribers will get my column before anyone else does and their questions will be prioritized for future editions. Sign up here!

For one thing, Ricard pointed out that there are many different values in life. Helping other people is absolutely a wonderful value. But there are others, too: art, for instance. He noted that we don't go around scolding Yo-Yo Ma for the thousands of hours he spent perfecting the cello; instead, we appreciate the beauty of his music. Spiritual growth through contemplation or meditation is like that, Ricard suggested. It's another value intrinsically worth pursuing. 

Ricard also emphasized, though, that helping others is something he values very deeply. Just like you, he prizes both contemplation and altruism. But he doesn't necessarily see a conflict between them. Instead, he's convinced that contemplative training actually helps you act altruistically in the world. If you don't have a calm and steady mind, it's hard to be present at someone's bedside and comfort them while they're dying. If you haven't learned to relinquish your grip on the self, it's hard to lead a nonprofit without falling prey to a clash of egos. 

Still, Ricard admitted that he is not without regret about his lifestyle. His regret, he said, was “not to have put compassion into action” for so many years. In his 50s, he decided to address this by setting up a foundation doing humanitarian work in Tibet, Nepal, and India. But the fact that he'd neglected to concretely help humanity for half a century seemed to weigh on him. 

What can we learn from Ricard's example? 

For someone like you, who values both contemplation and altruism, it's important to realize that each one can actually bolster the other. We've already seen Ricard make the point that contemplation can improve altruistic action. But another famous Buddhist talked about how action in the wider world can improve contemplation, too.

That Buddhist was Thich Nhat Hanh, the Zen teacher and peace activist who in the 1950s developed Engaged Buddhism, which urges followers to actively work on the social, political, and environmental issues of the day. Asked about the idea that people need to choose between engaging in social change or working on spiritual growth, the teacher said:

I think that view is rather dualistic. The [meditation] practice should address suffering: the suffering within yourself and the suffering around you. They are linked to each other. When you go to the mountain and practice alone, you don't have the chance to recognize the anger, jealousy, and despair that's in you. That's why it's good that you encounter people — so you know these emotions. So that you can recognize them and try to look into their nature. If you don't know the roots of these afflictions, you cannot see the path leading to their cessation. That's why suffering is very important for our practice.

I would add that contact with the world improves contemplation not only because it teaches us about suffering, but also because it gives us access to joyful insights. For example, Thich Nhat Hanh taught that one of the most important spiritual insights is “interbeing” — the notion that all things are mutually dependent on all other things. A great way to access that would be through a moment of wonder in a complex natural ecosystem, or through the experience of pregnancy, when cells from one individual integrate into the body of another seemingly separate self! 

At this point, you might have a question for these Buddhists: Okay, it's all well and good for you guys to talk about spiritual growth and social engagement going hand-in-hand, but you had the luxury of doing years of spiritual growth uninterrupted first! How am I supposed to train my mind while staying constantly engaged with a modern world that's designed to fragment my attention?

Part of the answer, Buddhist teachers say, is to practice both “on and off the cushion.” When we think about meditation, we often picture ourselves sitting on a cushion with our eyes closed. But it doesn't have to look that way. It can also be a state of mind with which we do whatever else it is we're doing: volunteering, commuting to work, drinking a cup of tea, washing the dishes. Thich Nhat Hanh was fond of saying, “Washing the dishes is like bathing a baby Buddha. The profane is the sacred. Everyday mind is Buddha's mind.”

But I think it's really hard to do that in any kind of consistent way unless you've already had concerted periods of practice. And that's the reason why retreats exist. 

Buddhist monks commonly do this — sometimes for three years, or for three months, depending on their tradition — but you don't have to be a monk or even a Buddhist to do it. Anyone can go on a retreat. I've found that even short, weekend-long retreats, where you're supported by the silent company of other practitioners and the guidance of teachers, can provide a helpful container for intensive meditation and catalyze your growth. It's a lot like language immersion: Sure, you can learn Italian by studying a few words on Duolingo alone each night, but you'll probably learn a whole lot faster if you spend a chunk of time living in a Tuscan villa.

So here's what I'd suggest to you: Pursue a career that includes actively doing good in the world — but be intentional about building in substantial blocks of time for contemplation, too. That could mean a year (or two or three) of meditative training before you go on the job market, to give you a stable base to launch off from. But it could also mean scheduling regular retreats for yourself — anywhere from three days to three months — in between your work commitments.

More broadly, though, I want you to remember that the ideas about the good life that you're thinking through didn't emerge in a vacuum. They're conditioned by history. 

As the 20th-century thinker Hannah Arendt points out, vita contemplativa (the contemplative life) has been deemed superior to vita activa (the life of activity) by most pre-modern Western thinkers, from the Ancient Greeks to the medieval Christians. But why? Aristotle, whom you mentioned, put contemplation on a pedestal because he believed it was what free men did, whereas men who labored were coerced by the necessity to stay alive, and were thus living as if they were enslaved whether they were literally enslaved or not.

In our modern world, Arendt notes, the hierarchy has been flipped upside down. Capitalist society valorizes the vita activa and downgrades the vita contemplativa. But this reversal still keeps the relationship between the two modes stable: It keeps them positioned in a hierarchical order. Arendt thinks that's silly. Rather than placing one above the other, she encourages us to consider the distinct values of both. 

I think she's right. Not only does contemplation need action to survive (even philosophers have to eat), but contemplation without action is impoverished. If Aristotle had had an open-minded encounter with enslaved people, maybe he would have been a better philosopher, one who challenged hierarchies rather than reinforcing them.

It can be perfectly okay, and potentially very beneficial, to spend some stretch of time in pure contemplation like Aristotle — or like the Buddhist monk Ricard. But if you do it forever, chances are you'll end up with the same regret as the monk: the regret of not putting compassion into action.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Elon Musk says he's formed the 'America Party.' Trump says he's gone 'off the rails.'","https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-america-party-2025-7","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 00:17:00 GMT","

Elon Musk declared on X the formation of a new political party amid his ongoing feud with President Donald Trump over the ""Big Beautiful Bill.""

""Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom,"" Musk wrote in an X post on Saturday.

The Tesla and SpaceX CEO had said Friday on his social media platform that one way the new party could work is to focus on winning just a handful of Senate seats and House districts that could serve as the ""deciding vote"" on ""contentious laws,"" given the ""razor-thin legislative margins"" in Congress.

Musk said in an X post on Sunday that while his party may consider ""backing a candidate for president"" down the line, its main focus ""for the next 12 months is on the House and the Senate.""

In response, Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Sunday that Musk had gone ""completely off the rails.""

""He even wants to start a Third Political Party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States,"" the president wrote at the start of a lengthy post. Trump went on to imply that Musk was angry because the spending bill eliminated incentives to buy electric cars.

When asked about the America Party, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview with CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that the boards of Musk's companies would rather he focus on business than on politics.

""Look, the principles of DOGE were very popular. I think, if you looked at the polling, Elon was not,"" Bessent told CNN.

""The polling for me was very positive a year ago, which is why Trump used me so much,"" Musk wrote in an X post on Sunday in response to Bessent's remarks.

Musk's popularity has taken a significant hit. He originally had a nearly 50% favorability rating in November, but it fell to 35% last month, per polls from Economist-YouGov.

Fellow billionaire Mark Cuban, meanwhile, appeared — not for the first time — to support the idea of a new party, replying to Musk's Saturday announcement with a series of fireworks and fire emojis.

""I work with @voterchoice. They will help you get on ballots. That is their mission,"" Cuban wrote in another post.

SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci, who briefly served as White House communications director under Trump in 2017, also reached out to Musk.

""I would like to meet to discuss. My DMs are open,"" he replied to Musk.

Musk's ""America Party"" announcement came after he conducted a July 4 poll, asking X users if they want ""independence"" from the two-party system. About 65% of the 1.25 million participants voted ""Yes.""

Musk, who was a staunch supporter of Trump's 2024 reelection bid, has been publicly critical of the president's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" a sweeping domestic policy bill that includes extensive tax cuts and could add more than $3 trillion to the national debt, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Musk has characterized the bill on X as a form of ""debt slavery.""

Just days after stepping away from his work at the White House DOGE Office, which was tasked with cutting spending and reducing the deficit, Musk in June called the legislation a ""massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill.""

Musk then proposed the idea of forming a new political party that represents the ""80% in the middle.""

Musk's repeated attacks on the bill led to a spectacular public fallout between him and the president. Trump even suggested that his office would look into possibly deporting Musk, a South African immigrant.

Musk's July 4 poll on X came the same day Trump signed the bill into law.

Musk and a White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

Musk's back-and-forth regarding his involvement in political affairs has been followed by volatile times for the CEO of Tesla, his EV company.

Wall Street analysts, including Tesla bull Dan Ives, have said that Musk's politics could lead the company astray if the chief executive doesn't snap back into focus.

Earlier in June, Baird analysts downgraded the Tesla stock, noting that the Musk-Trump spat adds ""uncertainty to TSLA's outlook.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","He Lost Half His Vision. Now He's Using AI to Spot Diseases Early.","https://www.businessinsider.com/kevin-choi-mediwhale-ai-doctor-vision-2025-7","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 00:00:00 GMT","

At 26, Kevin Choi got a diagnosis that changed his life: glaucoma.

It's a progressive eye disease that damages the optic nerve, often without symptoms until it's too late. By the time doctors caught it, Choi had lost half his vision.

An engineer by training — and a former rifleman in South Korea's Marine Corps — Choi thought he had a solid handle on his health.

""I was really frustrated I didn't notice that,"" he said.

The 2016 diagnosis still gives him ""panic."" But it also sparked something big.

That year, Choi teamed up with his doctor, a vitreoretinal surgeon, to cofound Mediwhale, a South Korea-based healthtech startup.

Their mission is to use AI to catch diseases before symptoms show up and cause irreversible harm.

""I'm the person who feels the value of that the most,"" Choi said.

The tech can screen for cardiovascular, kidney, and eye diseases through non-invasive retinal scans.

Mediwhale's technology is primarily used in South Korea, and hospitals in Dubai, Italy, and Malaysia have also adopted it.

Mediwhale said in September that it had raised $12 million in its Series A2 funding round, led by Korea Development Bank.

Choi believes AI is most powerful in the earliest stage of care: screening.

AI, he said, can help healthcare providers make faster, smarter decisions — the kind that can mean the difference between early intervention and irreversible harm.

In some conditions, ""speed is the most important,"" Choi said. That's true for ""silent killers"" like heart and kidney disease, and progressive conditions like glaucoma — all of which often show no early symptoms but, unchecked, can lead to permanent damage.

For patients with chronic conditions like diabetes or obesity, the stakes are even higher. Early complications can lead to dementia, liver disease, heart problems, or kidney failure.

The earlier these risks are spotted, the more options doctors — and patients — have.

Choi said Mediwhale's AI makes it easier to triage by flagging who's low-risk, who needs monitoring, and who should see a doctor immediately.

Screening patients at the first point of contact doesn't require ""very deep knowledge,"" Choi said. That kind of quick, low-friction risk assessment is where AI shines.

Mediwhale's tool lets patients bypass traditional procedures — including blood tests, CT scans, and ultrasounds — when screening for cardiovascular and kidney risks.

Choi also said that when patients see their risks visualized through retinal scans, they tend to take it more seriously.

Despite his belief in AI's power, Choi is clear: It's not a replacement for doctors.

Patients want to hear a human doctor's opinion and reassurance.

Choi also said that medicine is often messier than a clean dataset. While AI is ""brilliant at solving defined problems,"" it lacks the ability to navigate nuance.

""Medicine often requires a different dimension of decision-making,"" he said.

For example: How will a specific treatment affect someone's life? Will they follow through? How is their emotional state affecting their condition? These are all variables that algorithms still struggle to read, but doctors can pick up. These insights ""go beyond simple data points,"" Choi said.

And when patients push back — say, hesitating to start a new medication — doctors are trained to both understand why and guide them.

They are able to ""navigate patients' irrational behaviours while still grounding decisions in quantitative data,"" he said.

""These are complex decision-making processes that extend far beyond simply processing information.""

On what should have been a festive Fourth of July, disaster struck in central Texas.

Flash flooding left at least 68 dead in Kerr County, including 40 adults and 28 children, Sheriff Larry Leitha said during a Sunday press conference.

During a separate press conference, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said an additional 10 people were dead in the broader central Texas area. At least 82 are confirmed dead as of Monday morning.

Abbott said another 41 people are still missing across the affected area, including 10 children and one counselor from Camp Mystic, a Christian camp for girls along the Guadalupe River.

Abbott signed a federal disaster declaration on Saturday, which President Donald Trump signed on Sunday. Abbott also issued a disaster declaration for six Texas counties in addition to the 15 he identified on Friday, when heavy rains first caused the flooding.

On Truth Social, Trump said his administration was working with state and local officials to respond to the flooding.

""Melania and I are praying for all of the families impacted by this horrible tragedy,"" Trump wrote on Saturday. ""Our Brave First Responders are on site doing what they do best. GOD BLESS THE FAMILIES, AND GOD BLESS TEXAS!""

The X account for Elon Musk's Starlink, SpaceX's satellite internet system, is offering support to affected residents. Musk has a strong presence in Texas through his companies Tesla, X, and SpaceX.

""In support of those impacted by flooding in Texas, Starlink is providing Mini kits for search and rescue efforts — ensuring connectivity even in dead zones — and one month of free service for thousands of customers in the region, including those who paused service so they can reactivate Starlink during this time,"" the post said.

Officials said over 12 inches of rain fell in the county on Friday. The National Weather Service first issued a flash flood warning at 4 a.m. on Friday.

It extended the flood watch until Monday at 7 p.m., saying there was ""a threat of flash flooding from slow moving heavy rains overnight and through the day on Monday.""

The region is a popular vacation destination and home to multiple summer camps for children. Camp Mystic in Hunt has about 750 campers. Two days after disaster struck, officials said they remain hopeful they can find survivors.

In a statement posted to its website, the Heart O' the Hills, another girls' camp based in Hunt, said its director, Jane Ragsdale, had died in the floods.

""We have received word that Jane Ragsdale did not make it,"" it said. ""We are mourning the loss of a woman who influenced countless lives and was the definition of strong and powerful.""

It added that the camp was not in session as the flooding hit, and that ""most of those who were on camp at the time have been accounted for and are on high ground.""

Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said during an earlier press conference that the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes, washing away bridges and buildings in a wide area.

On Facebook, parents and community members have circulated flyers with contact numbers, urging the public to help locate the missing children.

Kerr County has an estimated population of about 53,900, according to a 2024 count by the US Census Bureau. The county sits in the Hill Country region of Central Texas, which includes cities like San Antonio and Austin. Beyond the Guadalupe River, the region is home to several others, including the Colorado, Concho, and Blanco Rivers.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","From the LA fires to the Texas floods, consumer drones keep getting in the way of rescue operations","https://www.businessinsider.com/consumer-drones-interfere-rescue-operations-texas-floods-la-wildfires-helene-2025-7","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 09:32:00 GMT","

Search and rescue operations continue in central Texas, where catastrophic flooding on Friday has killed more than 80 people. Dozens are still missing.

During a Sunday press conference, after the usual updates, officials made what has become a familiar request during recent natural disasters: Don't fly your personal drones over the disaster area.

""We know that people want to volunteer, but what we are starting to see is personal drones flying,"" Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice told reporters. ""These personal drones flying is a danger to aircraft, which then risks further operations.""

The Kerrville Police Department echoed Rice's remarks on Sunday.

""Media-operated drones are interfering with official search and rescue drones. There is a no-fly zone in Kerr County for private drones,"" the department said on its Facebook page. ""We need cooperation in this matter. Let our first responders do their job.""

During a press conference hosted by Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday, Maj. Gen. Thomas M. Suelzer of the Texas National Guard said the department had launched an MQ-9 Reaper drone to perform assessment operations.

""It's truly an eye in the sky for our search and rescue people,"" Suelzer said.

Though drones are now commonly used in military and law enforcement operations, they are also popular among civilians, mostly for photography and shooting video but also for those looking to help search after disasters. During several recent disasters, however, officials have said those civilian drone operators have hindered rescue operations.

In 2021, the Dixie fire spread across Northern California. The flames ripped through communities, displacing residents and burning nearly a million acres of land.

That July, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said an unauthorized drone had impeded emergency operations.

""Yesterday, aircraft assigned to the #DixieFire were forced to land due to an unauthorized drone flying over the fire traffic area,"" the agency said on its official Facebook page. ""Drones restrict firefighters' ability to protect lives, property, and natural resources. Remember, if you fly, we can't!""

Hurricane Helene battered the southeastern US in late 2024.

After making landfall in Florida, it traveled up the coast through Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. Heavy rainfall, strong winds, and flooding demolished homes and submerged vehicles.

Amid the search and rescue efforts, the US Department of Transportation shared an X post asking consumer drone operators to stay clear. At the time, the Federal Aviation Administration had issued a temporary flight restriction in certain areas.

""Do not fly your drone near or around rescue and recovery efforts for Hurricane Helene,"" the agency said. ""Interfering with emergency response operations impacts search and rescue operations on the ground.""

The FAADroneZone, the agency's site for drone services, said in a separate X post that ""interfering with emergency response efforts may result in fines or criminal prosecution.""

At the time, some online observers thought volunteer drone operators were being barred from assisting in relief efforts, which sparked a backlash.

The DOT later clarified that the FAA didn't ban consumer drones from providing assistance and relief.

""These restrictions occur at the request of local authorities or law enforcement. FAA does not put these into place without requests,"" a spokesperson told Fox News.

The agency added that ""anyone looking to use a drone or other aircraft to assist in Hurricane Helene disaster relief and recovery efforts should coordinate with first responders and law enforcement on scene to ensure they do not disrupt life-saving operations.""

In January, a series of wildfires erupted across the Los Angeles region, causing widespread damage and forcing hundreds of thousands to evacuate their homes.

In addition to emergency firefighting efforts on the ground, officials deployed two Super Scoopers, which are amphibious aircraft that collect water to drop on wildfires.

An unauthorized civilian drone struck one Super Scooper, forcing it out of service.

""We would like to remind everyone that flying a drone in the midst of firefighting efforts is a federal crime and punishable by up to 12 months in prison or a fine of up to $75,000,"" a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesperson said at the time.

The incident prompted an investigation by the FAA, which said in a statement that ""flying a drone near a wildfire is dangerous and can cost lives.""

The Department of Justice said the drone operator agreed to plead guilty to one count of unsafe operation of an uncrewed aircraft. The plea agreement included the drone operator paying full restitution to the Government of Quebec, which supplied the aircraft, and completing 150 hours of community service.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","AI is shaking up Hollywood. Here are the startups and investors jumping into the fray.","https://www.businessinsider.com/startups-investors-ai-hollywood-pitch-decks","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 09:05:00 GMT","

Hollywood giants are pushing back on AI's encroachment. Disney and Universal recently sued Midjourney, accusing it of using tech to rip off their famous characters.

But inside entertainment companies, it's a whole different story. The biggest studios and filmmakers are using AI technology in various ways — and people in Hollywood are taking note. The AI on the Lot conference in May has doubled its attendance to 1,200 over three years, while AI editing company Runway attracted some 1,000 people to its third film festival.

The tantalizing promise of AI is that it could solve big problems in the entertainment business, like content discovery and high production costs.

""No matter how you feel about AI tools in the media and entertainment business, they're here to stay,"" said Peter Csathy, who advises media companies.

Investors are climbing on board companies like Ecco, an AI startup that helps people find titles across multiple streamers using queries like ""find me all the shows about F1."" It has raised $7 million from Ben Silverman, Shaquille O'Neal, and others.

One such investor is Ishan Sinha, a consumer partner at Point72 Ventures. He said the hype around AI-generated video hasn't translated into consumer interest. He sees the most potential in companies that use AI to promote distribution through personalization, translation, and IP ownership.

""We believe the winning consumer businesses aggregate eyeballs — they have some type of a hook, whether it's content aggregation, playlists, proprietary IP, etc., that acquires and retains users,"" he said.

Point72 Ventures' investments include GlobalComix, which uses AI to bring recommendations and language translation to comic book and manga readers that they couldn't otherwise find, and Cheehoo, which is working with studios to simplify animation.

The firm also invested in Chronicle Studios, which aims to help animators grow their audiences and monetize their projects beyond YouTube.

Here are some AI companies transforming different areas of Hollywood, and the pitch decks some of them used to raise funding.

AI may still be a long way from making full-length movies, but it's quickly making inroads in animation. Toonstar, a startup behind ""StEvEn & Parker,"" uses AI for tasks ranging from developing storylines to creating images and says it can make episodes at a fraction of the cost of conventional methods.

Chronicle Studios is a startup cofounded by Chris deFaria, a former animation president at Warner Bros. and Comcast's DreamWorks, that's using AI to help creators level up, with a focus on animators. Others chasing the animation or independent creator opportunity are Further Adventures, a new studio that's investing in digital creators and independent filmmakers; Invisible Universe, an animation studio backed by Seven Seven Six; and Promise, an AI studio backed by Peter Chernin's North Road, Andreessen Horowitz, and Google.

""AI can't really make stories that are enduring,"" deFaria told BI. ""The biggest pain point is getting an audience.""

Other companies, such as Runway, which has raised $545 million from General Atlantic and others, and Connect Ventures-backed Deep Voodoo, are using AI to provide tools for de-aging and other special effects work.

Some have entered the rollup stage. Metaphysic, which was known for de-aging Tom Hanks and Robin Wright for the Robert Zemeckis film ""Here,"" was acquired in February by DNEG Group's AI company Brahma. Papercup's voice-cloning IP was acquired in June by RWS, a content solutions company, while its team was acquired by Scale AI.

AI is also being applied to speed the dubbing process, recreate the voices of bygone actors, and restore old films and TV series. With streamers going global, there's a big demand to translate titles for new markets, and new approaches to AI promise to eliminate awkward dubbing of the past.

Runway made news this past year for deals with Lionsgate to train an AI model on its library and with AMC Networks, which will use its tools to generate promotional material for its shows.

One player, Deepdub, which uses AI to dub movies and shows, just extended its tech to real-time dubbing of live sports commentary, esports shoutcasting, and breaking news coverage.

""For the first time, broadcasters can deliver real-time, multilingual dubbing that captures not just words, but the energy, urgency, and authenticity of live content,"" said Ofir Krakowski, the company's CEO.

A third area where AI startups have been active in Hollywood is in the content creation process more broadly.

This can involve everything from AI in the script reading phase to scouring video libraries to generate new ideas for titles based on what's performed well in the past.

One, Paris-based Moments Lab, recently raised a $24 million round from backers including Oxx and Orange Ventures to expand its AI tools that are used by Warner Bros. Discovery, Hearst, and others.

Moments can make clips for social media seven times faster than the conventional approach, cofounder Phil Petitpont recently told BI, citing internal research. He said media companies would be able to use AI to help make full-length documentaries based on their video libraries in several months, while predictive modeling tools that can suggest audience-boosting changes are a year away.

""We're not very far from that because audience data is very easily available on YouTube,"" he said.

President Donald Trump said on Sunday that it is unlikely Elon Musk's new political party, the America Party will succeed. 

""I am saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely 'off the rails,' essentially becoming a TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks,"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.

""He even wants to start a Third Political Party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States - The System seems not designed for them,"" Trump continued.

Trump said having a third political party would create ""Complete and Total DISRUPTION & CHAOS."" He added that the GOP, in contrast, is a ""smooth running 'machine'"" that passed his ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" last week.

Musk announced the formation of the America Party on Saturday, a day after Trump signed his signature tax bill on July 4. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO had publicly criticized Trump's bill and floated the idea of starting his own party last month. 

""It is obvious with the insane spending of this bill, which increases the debt ceiling by a record FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS that we live in a one-party country — the PORKY PIG PARTY!!"" Musk said in an X post on June 30. 

""Time for a new political party that actually cares about the people,"" he added.

Musk revisited the idea on Friday morning, when he conducted a poll on X. The poll obtained over 1.2 million votes, with over 65% of them supporting the creation of the America Party.

""By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it!"" Musk wrote in an X post on Saturday. 

Musk previously said on Friday that he envisioned having the America Party ""serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws"" given the ""razor-thin legislative margins"" in Congress. 

""One way to execute on this would be to laser-focus on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts,"" Musk wrote on X on Friday.

Trump's dismissal of Musk's America Party is not without basis. Past attempts at developing a third political party have faltered. 

Billionaire Ross Perot ran as an independent presidential candidate for the 1992 election. While Perot did get nearly 19% of the popular vote, he was unable to obtain any electoral college votes. 

Perot made a second attempt in 1996, when he ran under the Reform Party ticket, a party he founded in 1995. This time, Perot's share of the popular vote fell to about 8% and he did not receive any electoral college votes.

Perot's party didn't manage to win any House or Senate seats in subsequent elections, though its candidate, Jesse Ventura managed to win the 1998 Minnesota gubernatorial election. Ventura, however, left the party just a year after taking office.

Musk and the White House did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

The tech industry is now split between two starkly different job markets.

On one side, there's a stalled job market where more workers are staying put. On the other there is a rapidly expanding artificial intelligence sector that's reshaping the talent landscape.

To help founders understand the situation, Atli Thorkelsson, head of talent network at Redpoint Ventures, created a slide deck on the state of tech hiring. He presented it at the firm's third annual InfraRed Summit, which brings together founders of up-and-coming companies in cloud infrastructure.

The deck includes data cobbled together from Pave, a compensation management tool; TrueUp, a tech jobs marketplace; and SignalFire, an early-stage venture capital firm.

Thorkelsson notes that the charts throughout the deck represent fast-growing tech firms. Since Redpoint used data from vendors that mainly serve tech clients with open roles, those companies end up overrepresented.

Here's an exclusive look at the 13-slide deck that Redpoint shared with founders.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I'm a university lecturer concerned that students are using AI to cheat. It's made my workload skyrocket, and I've had to make drastic changes.","https://www.businessinsider.com/lecturer-ai-cheating-students-chatgpt-2025-7","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 11:44:00 GMT","

This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with Risa Morimoto, a senior lecturer in economics at SOAS University of London, in England. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

Students always cheat. 

I've been a lecturer for 18 years, and I've dealt with cheating throughout that time, but with AI tools becoming widely available in recent years, I've experienced a significant change.

There are definitely positive aspects to AI. It's much easier to get access to information and students can use these tools to improve their writing, spelling, and grammar, so there are fewer badly written essays.

However, I believe some of my students have been using AI to generate essay content that pulls information from the internet, instead of using material from my classes to complete their assignments.

AI is supposed to help us work efficiently, but my workload has skyrocketed because of it. I have to spend lots of time figuring out whether the work students are handing in was really written by them.

I've decided to take dramatic action, changing the way I assess students to encourage them to be more creative and rely less on AI. The world is changing, so universities can't stand still.

I've worked at SOAS University of London since 2012. My teaching focus is ecological economics.

Initially, my teaching style was exam-based, but I found that students were anxious about one-off exams, and their results wouldn't always correspond to their performance.

I eventually pivoted to a focus on essays. Students chose their topic and consolidated theories into an essay. It worked well — until AI came along.

Cheating used to be easier to spot. I'd maybe catch one or two students cheating by copying huge chunks of text from internet sources, leading to a plagiarism case. Even two or three years ago, detecting inappropriate AI use was easier due to signs like robotic writing styles.

Now, with more sophisticated AI technologies, it's harder to detect, and I believe the scale of cheating has increased. 

I'll read 100 essays and some of them will be very similar using identical case examples, that I've never taught.

These examples are typically referenced on the internet, which makes me think the students are using an AI tool that is incorporating them. Some of the essays will cite 20 pieces of literature, but not a single one will be something from the reading list I set.

While students can use examples from internet sources in their work, I'm concerned that some students have just used AI to generate the essay content without reading or engaging with the original source.

I started using AI detection tools to assess work, but I'm aware this technology has limitations. 

AI tools are easy to access for students who feel pressured by the amount of work they have to do. University fees are increasing, and a lot of students work part-time jobs, so it makes sense to me that they want to use these tools to complete work more quickly.

During the first lecture of my module, I'll tell students they can use AI to check grammar or summarize the literature to better understand it, but they can't use it to generate responses to their assignments.

SOAS has guidance for AI use among students, which sets similar principles about not using AI to generate essays.

Over the past year, I've sat on an academic misconduct panel at the university, dealing with students who've been flagged for inappropriate AI use across departments. 

I've seen students refer to these guidelines and say that they only used AI to support their learning and not to write their responses.

It can be hard to make decisions because you can't be 100% sure from reading the essay whether it's AI-generated or not. It's also hard to draw a line between cheating and using AI to support learning.

My colleagues and I speak about the negative and positive aspects of AI, and we're aware that we still have a lot to learn about the technology ourselves.

The university is encouraging lecturers to change their teaching and assessment practices. At the department level, we often discuss how to improve things.

I send my two young children to a school with an alternative, progressive education system, rather than a mainstream British state school. Seeing how my kids are educated has inspired me to try two alternative assessment methods this coming academic year. I had to go through a formal process with the university to get them approved.

I'll ask my students to choose a topic and produce a summary of what they learned in the class about it. Second, they'll create a blog, so they can translate what they've understood of the highly technical terms into a more communicable format.

My aim is to make sure the assignments are directly tied to what we've learned in class and make assessments more personal and creative. 

The old assessment model, which involves memorizing facts and regurgitating them in exams, isn't useful anymore. ChatGPT can easily give you a beautiful summary of information like this. Instead, educators need to help students with soft skills, communication, and out-of-the-box thinking.

In a statement to BI, a SOAS spokesperson said students are guided to use AI in ways that ""uphold academic integrity."" They said the university encouraged students to pursue work that is harder for AI to replicate and have ""robust mechanisms"" in place for investigating AI misuse. ""The use of AI is constantly evolving, and we are regularly reviewing and updating our policies to respond to these changes,"" the spokesperson added.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Tesla stock drops after Musk draws Trump's anger with plans for a new political party","https://www.businessinsider.com/ives-tesla-investors-elon-musk-exhausted-politics-third-party-2025-7","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 14:33:00 GMT","

Tesla stock dropped sharply on Monday as traders reacted to Elon Musk's announcement that he would start a new political party.

Shares tumbled as much as 8% to $288.77 before paring losses.

Musk's announcement that he would start an ""America Party"" is the latest chapter in the Tesla CEO's political saga this year, and Monday's move is a sign that investors are weary of another potential distraction from his work at the EV maker. The Wedbush Securities analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives said there was a ""sense of exhaustion"" over Musk's political activities.

Over the weekend, Musk announced the formation of a new political party, the day after President Donald Trump signed his Big Beautiful Bill into law. Trump responded by saying Musk had gone ""off the rails.""

Ives wrote that Musk was going in ""exactly the opposite direction"" that investors wanted.

""Musk diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take during this crucial period for the Tesla story,"" Ives wrote in a note published on Sunday.

Ives said Tesla investors were relieved when Musk left the Trump Administration and the DOGE office in May. It was good news for investors who worried that Tesla wasn't getting enough of the billionaire's attention.

""That relief lasted a very short time and now has taken a turn for the worst with this latest announcement,"" Ives wrote.

Tesla shares peaked at about $480 in December as investors wagered Musk's close association with Trump would benefit Tesla. But the pair's relationship has deteriorated in recent months as they've clashed over government spending.

Ives predicted that Tesla's shares would be ""under some pressure"" on Monday as investors worry about Trump viewing Musk as a competitor instead of an ally.

""Musk/Tesla do not need to keep poking the bear as Trump can create more hurdles for Musk/Tesla/SpaceX over the coming years,"" Ives wrote.

Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Musk announced the party in an X post on Saturday, saying, ""Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.""

In response, Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Sunday that Musk had gone ""completely off the rails.""

""He even wants to start a Third Political Party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States,"" the president wrote, adding that Musk was angry because the spending bill eliminated incentives to buy electric cars.

Musk's involvement in politics in the past year has hit Tesla's performance. The EV maker faced protests, boycotts, and attacks over Musk's work with DOGE. More recently, the company's stock has suffered because of the ongoing feud between Musk and the president.

Last week, the carmaker reported that it delivered about 384,000 EVs in the second quarter, a 13.5% decrease from the same period in 2024.

Still, Tesla shareholders have long indicated that they don't think Musk can be replaced as CEO.

In May, Tesla's stock rose 7% in the week after Musk said he was ""back to spending 24/7 at work"" and sleeping in the office.

In June last year, shareholders approved Musk's controversial $55 billion pay package, which was largely seen as a referendum on his leadership.

There was concern among investors that if the pay package had been thrown out, Musk might lose interest in the EV giant and divert attention to his other ventures.

Extreme Weather:

People look on as law enforcement and volunteers continue to search for missing people near Camp Mystic in Hunt, Texas, on July 5.

Three days after cataclysmic floods tore through a stretch of the Texas Hill Country, officials have confirmed the deaths of 27 children and counselors who had been missing from a girls' summer camp. Statewide, authorities counted more than 80 deathsBloomberg Terminal and said the number was almost certain to climb as rescuers sorted through mounds of debris.

Officials refused to say at a news conference Monday morning how many additional people were still believed missing, but warned that more heartache was sure to come. The confirmation from Camp Mystic that the campers were dead was a devastating blow to family and community members who had been holding out hope for their survival. More than 750 kids were at the property along the Guadalupe River on Friday morning when torrential rains unleashed a flash flood that swept away cabins, campsites, bridges and roads, hampering search and recovery efforts.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

BRICS officials kept their collective heads down on Monday morning as they awoke to an overnight threat by US President Donald Trump to penalize them for adopting policies he said were “anti-American.”

Members of the ten-nation grouping of emerging-market economies were reluctant to engage with Trump's warning of additional 10% tariffs as they left their hotels in suddenly-rainy Rio de Janeiro for the concluding day of the BRICS summit hosted by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.

US Stocks:

The New York Stock Exchange.

Wall Street's latest tax dodge doesn't hide in the Cayman Islands or rely on complex derivatives. It's engineered to turn a publicly traded fund into a tax-minimizing machine that hums quietly on autopilot.

While dividends have long been a defining feature of stock investing — a sign of corporate discipline and investor reward — Roundhill Investments plans to launch the S&P 500 No Dividend Target exchange-traded fund on July 10 with the ticker XDIV. Its ambition is simple but strategic: track the performance of the famous benchmark while dodging its payouts. The fund will sell holdings just before their dividend dates — steering income away from ETF shareholders and, in the process, away from their tax bills.

While the company employed open-source code — as is “common practice” — Huawei said it respected intellectual property and stuck closely to licensing terms.

Rather than a diet of social media vibes, the company's investors reach toward an underlying rationale — sheer faith in the genius of Elon Musk.

The dream.

 (Photo by Vincent Feuray / Hans Lucas /AFP via Getty Images)

As a stock, Tesla Inc.'s relationship with what are called the ‘fundamentals' is similar to Elon Musk's with President Donald Trump: That is, wayward, troubled and unconvincing. So is Tesla a meme stock? Think of it more as a ‘dream' stock.

The sort of bad news or numbers that nudge ordinary stocks off a cliff can weirdly lend Tesla wings. Take those dreadful sales figures it just reported, which somehow sent the stock up 5% in a flat market. The ostensible reason was that, while they missed the consensus forecast, it was only by a little and a relief rally kicked in. It's a handy rationale let down only by its glaring logical inconsistencies. The forecast had already dropped by 23% since the start of the year. Moreover, during that time, Tesla's triple-digit earnings multiple had actually increased further — a prerequisite for relief is some angst beforehand, surely?","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management LLC is moving into the fast-growing market for buffer ETFs designed to limit equity losses, at a time when her tech funds continue to bleed assets.

The investment firm last week submittedBloomberg Terminal paperwork to launch four exchange-traded funds that seek to protect investors against modest losses in the equity market while still offering upside.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday said the Trump administration will make ""several"" trade-related announcements in the next 48 hours, signaling imminent progress even as U.S. tariff deadlines appear to be shifting.

Speaking on CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" Bessent also declined, yet again, to rule out the possibility that he could serve as the next chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, if President Donald Trump asks him to.

Bessent said foreign trade officials are rushing to make deals with the United States before July 9, when high tariff rates on dozens of countries' goods are set to snap back into effect.

""We've had a lot of people change their tune in terms of negotiations,"" he said. ""So my, my mailbox was full last night with a lot of new offers, a lot of new proposals.""

""It's going to be a busy couple of days,"" he added.

But Bessent also repeated the administration's new line, rolled out over the holiday weekend, that country-specific tariff rates will not be collected until Aug. 1.

His remarks came one day after Trump said his administration could send as many as 15 letters to U.S. trade partners between Monday and Wednesday, dictating new tariff rates that would be imposed on their exports to the United States.

Trump also said ""some deals have been made,"" suggesting the administration could unveil a mix of bilateral trade agreements and unilateral tariff letters this week.

Bessent said on CNBC that the letters would be ""pretty standard.""

""It's just, 'Thank you for wanting to trade with the United States of America. We welcome you as a trading partner. And here's the rate, unless you want to come back and try to negotiate,'"" Bessent said.

On Sunday night, Trump said in a Truth Social post that tariff ""Letters, and/or Deals,"" will be sent out starting Monday at noon ET.

Earlier in the day Sunday, Trump gave a vague answer when he was asked if U.S. tariff rates will be changing on Wednesday, or not until Aug. 1.

""They're going to be tariffs. The tariffs are going to be the tariffs. I think we'll have most countries done by July 9. Either a letter or a deal,"" Trump said before returning to Washington, D.C., from New Jersey.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who was standing next to Trump on an airport taxiway, added, ""But they go into effect on Aug. 1 ... the president is setting the rates and the deals right now.""

The White House did not respond to several requests from CNBC for more clarity on the trade timeline.

Bessent was also asked again Monday about the possibility that he could succeed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends next May.

""I will do what the President wants,"" Bessent said. ""But I think that we are making great gains here at Treasury, we've had a busy five, six months out of the box, and we've got a lot to do.""

In this article

Apple on Monday appealed what it called an ""unprecedented"" 500 million euro ($586 million) fine issued by the European Union for violating the bloc's Digital Markets Act.

""As our appeal will show, the EC [European Commission] is mandating how we run our store and forcing business terms which are confusing for developers and bad for users,"" the company said in a statement. ""We implemented this to avoid punitive daily fines and will share the facts with the Court.""

Apple recently made changes to its App Store's European policies that the company said would be in compliance with the DMA and would avoid the fines.

The Commission, which is the executive body of the EU, announced its fine in April, saying that Apple ""breached its anti-steering obligation"" under the DMA with restrictions on the App Store.

""Due to a number of restrictions imposed by Apple, app developers cannot fully benefit from the advantages of alternative distribution channels outside the App Store,"" the commission wrote. ""Similarly, consumers cannot fully benefit from alternative and cheaper offers as Apple prevents app developers from directly informing consumers of such offers.""

Under the DMA, tech giants like Apple and Google are required to allow businesses to inform end-users of offers outside their platform — including those at different prices or with different conditions.

Companies like Epic Games and Spotify have complained about restrictions within the App Store that make it harder for them to communicate alternative payment methods to iOS users. 

Apple typically takes a 15%-30% cut on in-app purchases.

Independent analyses — by sources ranging from Yale University to the Wharton School to the Congressional Budget Office – have each said that President Donald Trump's budget plan will add trillions of dollars to the U.S. deficit over the next 10 years. 

What's at stake if the deficit continues on its upward trajectory? This year, the U.S. deficit is exceeding 6% of the gross domestic product, a level roughly 63% higher than the average in the past five decades. And unlike past spikes, the current one isn't driven by war or economic crisis, leading many to raise concerns about why America might be playing with fire when it comes to its fiscal health. 

CNBC's ""America's Deficit Reckoning"" explores the consequences — not how to solve the budget deficit, but what's at stake if we don't. 

Watch the video to learn more.

Through interviews with more than a dozen top officials, economists and investors, including former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, macro investor Ray Dalio, and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, CNBC homed in on three potential areas of fallout: the markets, the economy and international relations.

Markets at risk: Persistent deficits have many prominent investors on high alert. Dalio said the U.S. is showing ""classic signs"" of a late-stage debt cycle, ascribing a 50% chance of trauma in the next three years. PIMCO's Chief Investment Officer Dan Ivascyn was a bit more sanguine, saying that he thinks a crisis of investor confidence is unlikely in the U.S. but has been diversifying away from Treasuries. That mirrors some recent activity in the bond market, which hasn't been overtly reacting to the new budget plan. Still, the bond vigilantes will police the deficit when they feel it's necessary: Ed Yardeni, who coined the term in the early '80s, said they're more powerful than ever. 

Economic strain: If Americans benefit from policies such as tax cuts and higher spending, why should they care about the longer-term implications of wider deficits? The most apparent risk to the economy is inflation, which would keep interest rates higher and ""crowd out"" private investment. Additionally, when interest payments become a higher proportion of federal outlays, they drain resources that would otherwise go to other budget line items, says Maya MacGuineas of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. And it hinders the government's ability to respond in the event of an emergency. But some of the worst economic effects will be felt by future generations, who, according to one Gen Zer interviewed by CNBC, are already concerned the deficit will impede their ability to collect social services. 

International implications: Admiral Michael Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, once called the national debt the ""greatest threat to national security."" His concern was that as debt levels increase and rates remain higher, it could squeeze discretionary defense spending. As historian Niall Ferguson warns: A great power that spends more on interest payments than defense breaches a threshold that historically has preceded a decline. The U.S. crossed that red line last year. There's also a significant interdependence between the U.S. and its foreign creditors, especially China and Japan, so if global investors begin to truly question America's fiscal health, the ripple effects could extend beyond the bond markets. 

The clock is ticking: Experts at the Penn Wharton Budget Model estimate the U.S. has less than 20 years to fix its fiscal trajectory. After that, even aggressive tax hikes or spending cuts may not be enough to stave off default — implicit or otherwise. While the U.S. can technically print its way out of debt, doing so risks runaway inflation, economic contraction, and geopolitical fallout. 

As Rubin put it, we may be entering uncharted territory. The time to prepare is now — before markets force our hand.

In this article

Tesla stock fell about 7% on Monday after CEO Elon Musk announced plans to form a new political party.

The stock was on pace for its worst day since June 5, when it fell 14% as the clash between Musk and President Donald Trump erupted.

Musk said Saturday that the party would be called the ""America Party"" and could focus ""on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts."" He suggested this would be ""enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws, ensuring that they serve the true will of the people.""

The billionaire's involvement in politics has been a point of contention for investors. Musk earlier this year was instrumental in the so-called Department of Government Efficiency and worked closely with Trump — a move seen as potentially hurting Tesla's brand.

Musk left DOGE in May, which helped Tesla's stock.

Now the tech billionaire's reinvolvement in the political arena is making investors nervous.

""Very simply Musk diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take during this crucial period for the Tesla story,"" Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, said in a note Sunday.

""While the core Musk supporters will back Musk at every turn no matter what, there is broader sense of exhaustion from many Tesla investors that Musk keeps heading down the political track,"" he wrote.

Musk's previous political foray earned him Trump's praise in the early days, but he has since drawn the ire of the U.S. president.

The two have clashed over various areas of policy, including Trump's spending bill, which Musk has said would increase America's debt burden. Musk has taken issue with particular cuts to tax credits and support for solar and wind energy and electric vehicles.

Trump on Sunday called Musk's move to form a political party ""ridiculous,"" adding that the Tesla boss had gone ""completely off the rails.""

Musk is contending with more than just political turmoil. Tesla reported a 14% year-on-year decline in car deliveries in the second quarter, missing expectations. The company is facing rising competition, especially in its key market, China.

An apology can be a crucial opportunity to spark positive change and build trust.

That's especially true for bosses and leaders, who sometimes have to make public statements acknowledging missteps or give internal apologies to their employees. Take Air India CEO Campbell Wilson, for example. In a June 12 video, shortly after an airplane crash that killed over 260 people, Wilson delivered remarks that drew hundreds of comments.

Some called for his resignation, while others thanked Wilson for his effort. And some viewers noticed identical language in a public apology from American Airlines CEO Robert Isom, who released a statement after a fatal crash on January 29.

Wilson's statement had several elements of an effective apology. He expressed ""deep sorrow"" about the crash, stated his intention to focus on passengers' loved ones and shared a helpline for them to use. He also said that the company was working closely with law enforcement and investigators on emergency response efforts, and to find out the cause of the accident.

""When a leader apologizes, they need to take full responsibility by showing they understand what went wrong, and also that they have a clear path forward to fix what happened and ensure it doesn't happen again,"" communication consultant and keynote speaker Lorraine K. Lee tells CNBC Make It.

Whether you're the CEO of a major airline addressing a tragedy or a middle manager apologizing for something more minor, ""timing is everything,"" adds Lee, who teaches public speaking courses at Stanford.

""If you wait too long to respond, you will look like you don't care or aren't being proactive. If you speak too quickly without a plan in place, you can misspeak or lose some credibility,"" she says. ""The best approach is to acknowledge the situation early and let people know you're aware and taking it seriously — and then follow up soon after with a thoughtful response and a plan of action.""

It's also important for other leaders, like managers and senior staff, to stay visible and address any issues in a timely way. If you caused a problem at work, get in front of it early and take full ownership instead of being holed up in your office until things blow over or glossing over the situation, says Lee.

When making an apology, a lack of genuine empathy won't fly, Lee warns, whether you're a CEO or a recently promoted manager with two direct reports.

""Of course it's important to rehearse and be clear on what you're going to say — but it's just as important to let your human side come through,"" she says. ""The best apologies are when you sound human and show genuine emotion without making it about yourself. Vulnerability is completely okay to show.""

If it's clear that you're reading from a teleprompter or document, if you have a dull, emotionless expression and cadence or if it's obvious you had no actual input in the statement you're giving, people may think you're disingenuous, eroding trust and potentially harming company culture and morale. The same goes for using passive language or not taking ownership of what went wrong.

For major CEOs, this can be difficult. Many of them don't write their own public apologies, according to Karthik Srinivasan, a communications strategy consultant. ""I know this for sure because I have spent 20+ years in the communications space, a decade of which was in corporate communications where my job was to write such speeches for CEOs and leaders,"" he wrote in a June 16 blog post.

Ultimately, no matter what company a boss or CEO works for, ""people want to hear from the leader, not the brand,"" she says. ""When you combine that with a plan, you look like a leader who can be trusted, who cares, and who knows what they're doing.""

It might be easier to realize Musk's dream of colonizing Mars than to bridge the political aisle in the U.S. government today.

To be fair, some thought appeared to be behind the move. Musk decided to form the party after holding a poll on X in which 65.4% of respondents voted in favor.

Once a niche player catering to middle-market borrowers — or companies that fall between small businesses and large corporations, which are typically underserved by traditional banks — private credit has grown into a $1.7 trillion industry.

Some caution that the boom, if left unchecked, could morph into the next source of systemic risk.

Artificial intelligence semiconductor startup Groq on Monday announced it has established its first data center in Europe as it steps up its international expansion.

Groq, which is backed by investment arms of Samsung and Cisco, said the data center will be located in Helsinki, Finland and is in partnership with Equinix.

Groq is looking to take advantage of rising demand for AI services in Europe following other U.S. firms which have also ramped up investment in the region. The Nordics in particular is a popular location for the data facilities as the region has easy access to renewable energy and cooler climates. Last month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was in Europe and signed several infrastructure deals, including data centers.

Groq, which is valued at $2.8 billion, designs a chip that the company calls a language processing unit (LPU). It is designed for inferencing rather training. Inferencing is when a pre-trained AI model interprets live data to come up with a result, much like the answers that are produced by popular chatbots.

While Nvidia has a stranglehold on the chips required for training huge AI models with its graphics processing units (GPUs), there is a swathe of startups hoping to take a slice of the pie when it comes to inferencing. SambaNova; Ampere, a company SoftBank is in the process of purchasing; Cerebras and Fractile, are all looking to join the AI inference race.

There are a number of areas where Groq wants to stand out from its rivals, including Nvidia, according to CEO Jonathan Ross.

In a Monday interview with CNBC, Ross said that Nvidia chips will use expensive components such as high-bandwidth memory, which currently have very few suppliers. Groq's LPUs meanwhile do not use such chips, and the company's supply chain is broadly based in North America.

""We're not as supply limited, and that's important for inference, which is very high volume, low margin,"" Ross told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

""And the reason that we're so good for Nvidia's shareholders is, we're happy to take that high volume but lower margin business and let others focus on the high-margin training.""

Ross also touted Groq's ability to deploy its technology at speed. He said that the company decided four weeks ago to build the data center in Helsinki is currently unloading its server racks into the location now.

""We expect to be serving traffic starting by the end of this week. That's built fast and so it's a very different proposition from what you see in the rest of the market,"" Ross said.

European politicians have been pushing the notion of sovereign AI — where data centers must be located in the region. Data centers that are located closer to users also help improve the speed of services.

Global data center builder Equinix connects different cloud providers together, such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud, making it easier for businesses to have multiple vendors. Groq's LPUs will be installed inside the Equinix data center allowing businesses to access Groq's inference capabilities via Equinix.

Groq currently has data centers in the U.S. and Canada and Saudi Arabia with its technology.

U.S. President Donald Trump lashed out against Elon Musk after he formed a new political party, calling the move ""ridiculous,"" and saying the tech billionaire had gone ""completely off the rails.""

""I am saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely 'off the rails,' essentially becoming a TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social late Sunday stateside. ""The one thing Third Parties are good for is the creation of complete and total disruption and chaos.""

Musk said in a post Saturday on X that he had set up the ""American Party"" to compete against the Republican and Democratic parties. The billionaire had teased for weeks the idea of a new political party, taking on Trump over the tax and spending plans that he said would bankrupt the economy.

""By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it!"" Musk wrote, ""Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.""

Disagreement over the spending bill had led to a dramatic falling out between Trump and Musk, souring the symbiotic relationship which saw Musk donate hundreds of millions of dollars to boost Trump's campaign for a second term.

The president later appointed Musk to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which has slashed the federal workforce and gutted agencies, including some that were charged with regulating Musk's companies.

""I think it's ridiculous to start a third party. We have a tremendous success with the Republican Party. The Democrats have lost their way, but it's always been a two-party system, and I think starting a third party just adds to confusion,"" Trump said Sunday, Reuters reported, a day after Musk's announcement.

Trump also took aim at Musk's push for an ""Electric Vehicle Mandate"" in the Sunday post, saying it would have ""forced everyone to buy an Electric Car in a short period of time.""

The president's tax and spending cut bill, which was signed into law on July 4, put an end to tax credits for buyers of electric vehicles.

Trump said in the post that he had warned Musk during his presidential campaign that he planned to terminate the EV tax credit if he won a second term.

""When Elon gave me his total and unquestioned Endorsement, I asked him whether or not he knew that I was going to terminate the EV Mandate – It was in every speech I made, and in every conversation I had. He said he had no problems with that,"" Trump said.

Musk's announcement drew criticism from Trump's allies such as James Fishback, CEO of investment firm Invest Azoria.

Fishback said he postponed an initial public listing of its Azoria Tesla Convexity ETF, ""in direct response"" to Musk's formation of a new party, and urged the Tesla's board to rein him in.

""This creates a conflict with his full-time responsibilities as CEO of Tesla. It diverts his focus and energy away from Tesla's employees and shareholders,"" Fishback said in a post on X.

This was CNBC's live blog covering European financial markets.

Stock markets in Europe rose, awaiting several trade deal announcements from the White House in the coming days.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index provisionally closed 0.4% higher. Regionally, France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX were up 0.4% and 1.1%, respectively. Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 was the only major index to decline, by 0.2%.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that there would be several trade announcements over the next 48 hours, adding that he expects ""it's going to be a busy couple of days."" However, Bessent did not specify which countries would be involved.

Although Capgemini's shares have fallen more than 5% so far during today's session, shares of its takeover target WNS are telling a different story.

WNS's U.S.-listed stock was last seen 15.7% higher in pre-market trade, as investors reacted to the news that it would be bought by France's Capgemini in a $3.3 billion cash deal. WNS offers businesses technology outsourcing and analytics services.

Currys plc shares retreated in the Monday session, after RBC Capital analysts downgraded the stock over its specular run this year.

Analysts at the investment bank said the London-listed stock had reached a ""fairer"" valuation after rising more than 30% this year, before the move lower by 5.5% on Monday as investors locked in the profits.

The RBC analysts pointed out that the stock was previously stuck in a downtrend in 2023 over its faltering and overleveraged business in the Nordics. But a turnaround plan, marked by the sale of a Greek subsidiary for 200 million euros ($235 million) in 2024 and a focus on profitable major markets like the U.K., attracted investors' attention, sending the shares higher.

With shares trading at £1.24 as of Friday ($1.7) — an increase of about 180% from the lows of October 2023 — RBC downgraded Currys to ""Sector Perform"", adding that the stock had reached a more ""reasonable"" valuation.

""Currys has a strong relative market position, some further self-help opportunities and is building what it calls more 'stabilisers' into the business, to reduce its macro and seasonal risk. This includes adding new products and more recurring revenues,"" said RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain in a note to clients. ""However, the discretionary nature of its assortment and its relatively low operating margins mean that its earnings outlook will remain sensitive to the macro.""

The company's board also rebuffed attempts by activist investor Elliot Management to take over the firm for £0.67 ($0.84) per share in February 2024.

Daimler Truck reported a 20% drop in its North American business for the second quarter from last year, a trend that's continued since early 2025.

The company said it recorded 13% growth in its Asia business, excluding China and India, and 5% growth in buses sold worldwide. In India and China, where it operates under the Mercedes-Benz Trucks brand, second-quarter sales fell by 0.5% from last year.

Shares have had a muted reaction and were up 0.6% at 10.50 a.m. in London.

The United States is the largest market by sales for Daimler Truck, with 38% of global sales, ahead of revenues of 11.3% from Germany, according to FactSet.

European markets have been open for almost an hour now, and oil and gas stocks are still leading regional losses.

The Stoxx Oil and Gas index was last seen trading 1.3% lower. Oil prices fell after the OPEC+ alliance agreed to a bigger-than-expected production increase.

Shares of French tech firm Capgemini have tumbled to the bottom of the regional Stoxx 600 index, shedding 2.7% by 8:45 a.m. in London.

The drop is taking place after the company said it would acquire U.S.-listed WNS in a $3.3 billion cash deal.

Energy major Shell on Monday lowered its production guidance for its integrated gas division across the second quarter and warned of weaker results from its gas and chemicals trading units.

In a trading update released ahead of its second-quarter financial results, the firm said it now expects integrated gas output to be in a range of 900,000 to 940,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), compared with a 890,000 to 950,000 boe/d guidance for the period issued during the company's first-quarter results outlook.

The world's largest trader of liquified natural gas anticipates second-quarter LNG volumes to come in between 6.4 million and 6.8 million metric tons, also below a previous estimate of 6.3 million to 6.9 million metric tons.

Shell warned of ""significantly lower"" trading results in the second quarter, compared with the previous three-month period, for both its integrated gas division and its chemicals and products unit, where it anticipates to be ""below break-even"" over the period.

""We see the release as weak; the weaker trading performance was likely expected, however the trading update points to a significantly worse performance in the downstream than anticipated,"" RBC Capital Markets analysts said in a note. ""Shell has issued successive positive trading updates over the last couple of years, and it looks like the positive streak has been broken.""

Shell shares were down 2.18% at 08:13 a.m. London time after the release.

We're 10 minutes into the first trading session of the week, and European stocks are trading in mixed territory.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 was last seen hovering just below the flatline, with no consensus movement among regional sectors.

Major bourses are also moving in opposite directions, with London's FTSE 100 down 0.1%, the French CAC 40 little changed, and Germany's DAX gaining 0.4%.

French tech firm Capgemini announced on Monday that it will buy U.S.-listed WNS in a $3.3 billion cash deal.

That translates to $76.50 per share in the technology outsourcing firm — a 17% premium on its July 3 closing price.

Capgemini is aiming to capitalize on WNS' generative and agentic artificial intelligence offerings, which it said would attract significant investments.

The U.K.'s largest residential gas and electricity supplier, Octopus Energy, is planning a £10 billion ($13.6 billion) demerger of its technology arm Kraken, Britain's Sky News reported over the weekend.

China's Finance Ministry said on Sunday that it was restricting government purchases of medical devices from the EU if they exceeded 45 million yuan ($6.3 million). It's a retaliation against the bloc saying last month it would ban Chinese firms from competing for EU public tenders for medical devices worth more than 60 billion euros ($70 billion) a year.

Trump's announcement, which did not elaborate on any specific policy of BRICS, came as the group's meeting is underway in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The bloc's leaders took aim at Trump's sweeping tariff policies in a joint statement dated July 6, warning against ""unjustified unilateral protectionist measures, including the indiscriminate increase of reciprocal tariffs.""

Musk, whose stark warnings over the spiraling $37 trillion U.S. debt pile were a big part of his campaign to get Trump back into the White House last year, has fallen out with Trump over the raising of the U.S. debt ceiling in Trump's signature ""one, big, beautiful bill.""

Now, as the bitcoin price is braced for “trillions and trillions” to hit the market, bitcoin and crypto analysts are predicting a bitcoin price boom as a result of the U.S.'s “massive fiscal expansion.”

“Nothing stops this train,” Lyn Alden, a financial commentator and founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy, said during this year's bitcoin conference in Las Vegas, a reference to TV show Breaking Bad that she used to describe the U.S. deficit that added almost $2 trillion to the U.S. debt pile in 2024.

Musk has pointed to Trump “increasing the deficit from an already insane $2 trillion under Biden to $2.5 trillion,” as why he's decided to start the America Party, posting to X that, “This will bankrupt the country.”

07/07 update: Elon Musk has confirmed the wild rumors and speculation that his new America Party could adopt bitcoin, replying to an X user that asked: ""Will America Party embrace bitcoin?""

“Fiat is hopeless, so yes,” Musk wrote, sending the bitcoin price higher, and referring to government-backed currencies known as fiat, rather than asset-backed currencies, which the dollar was before it abandoned the gold standard.

Elon Musk's hot-and-cold relationship with bitcoin has meant that even small references or mentions of bitcoin and crypto can cause prices to ricochet wildly.

While Musk has abstained from directly commenting on bitcoin and crypto over the last couple of years, his car company Tesla continues to hold around 10,000 bitcoin on its balance sheet and his support of U.S. president Donald Trump has coincided with the White House throwing its weight behind bitcoin. 

Since Musk announced he'd be creating a new U.S. political party, bitcoin and crypto traders have speculated if he'd back bitcoin over the U.S. dollar.

An X account called @AmericaPartyX, which is described as a ""commentary account"" and clarifies in its bio it has “no affiliation,” has repeatedly interacted with bitcoin accounts and posted pro-bitcoin messages, stoking expectations Musk's political party would support bitcoin.

Last week, X users were captivated by unconfirmed claims that Musk had ""liked"" a post suggesting he's ""quietly stacking"" bitcoin as he rails against the growing U.S. debt pile.

""Has anyone noticed how Elon Musk talks a lot about things like overspending and debt and bad government decisions in general, but has completely stopped talking about bitcoin,"" an anonymous bitcoin account posted, with the account of bitcoin storage company chief executive Seedor known only as Chris, replying: “Maybe be is stacking quietly.”

Chris then shared a screen recording to X that appears to show Elon Musk's X account liking the post, tagging two viral bitcoin content accounts.

However, doubts immediately surfaced that the account appearing to be Musk's didn't have a verification badge as well as claims that Chris has previously trolled people with photoshopped images.

Musk has said he believes president Trump as well as Republican Party politicians who won last year's election on a spending-reduction platform have betrayed voters who want government spending to be reined in.

Fears over the U.S. debt pile have taken hold among investors on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley, with David Friedberg, a host of the influential All In Podcast that's had both Musk and Trump on as guests, declaring: ""We are in a fiscal emergency in this country and we're not addressing it.""

U.S. debt has skyrocketed in recent years following huge government spending through the Covid-era and lockdowns, with interest rates that were rapidly hiked to rein in inflation adding to the cost of servicing the ballooning $37 trillion U.S. debt pile.

This week, Trump's ""one, big, beautiful bill,"" designed to overhaul the U.S. tax-and-spend landscape and power the country's next phase of growth while adding an expected $3 trillion of debt and raising the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, was passed by the House of Representatives.

“The ‘big beautiful bill's' massive fiscal expansion may weaken the dollar and stoke inflation, potentially boosting bitcoin's 'digital gold' appeal,"" James Toledano, chief operating officer at Unity Wallet, said in emailed comments, pointing to recent U.S. dollar weakness and echoing Musk who said the U.S. dollar “will be worth nothing if the U.S. doesn't do something about its national debt.”

The bill is “one big red flag for fiscal sustainability and one big green flag for risk assets, especially crypto,” according to bitcoin and crypto investor Lark Davis, who wrote in an emailed note that, ""this is exactly why we buy bitcoin.""

“Bitcoin has historically delivered double-digit gains in the weeks after big spending bills,"" Davis wrote. ""Bitcoin jumped 38% when Trump signed a major spending bill in late 2020. If bitcoin's price action were to repeat again, this time it would send the price to $150,000. And because nothing stops this train, it's hard money for the win during a debt crisis.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Ethereum is trading above the $2,500 level, showing notable strength despite recent volatility across the broader crypto market. Since early May, ETH has been trapped in a consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,700, struggling to establish a clear trend as both bulls and bears wait for confirmation. However, recent price action suggests growing momentum, with bulls maintaining control above key support zones.

Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared a technical analysis pointing to a decisive moment ahead for Ethereum. According to Runefelt, a breakout above the $2,700 resistance level is essential to ignite an impulsive move toward higher levels. Without that breakout, ETH risks remaining range-bound or revisiting lower demand zones.

The current market structure, combined with positive sentiment surrounding altcoins and growing institutional interest in Ethereum, contributes to the optimism. Still, the coming days will be critical. A sustained move above $2,700 could open the door for a rally toward $3,000 and beyond, while failure to break out may delay Ethereum's next major leg up. As Bitcoin trades just below its all-time highs, Ethereum's next move could also determine the short-term trajectory for the altcoin market at large.

Ethereum Leads Altcoin Recovery

Altcoins have been stuck in a prolonged bear market since 2022, with many tokens still trading well below their all-time highs. Amid this challenging backdrop, Ethereum has emerged as the leader of a potential recovery. Since its April lows, ETH has more than doubled in price, surging over 100% and reclaiming key support levels above $2,500. This sharp rebound suggests that a new bullish phase for Ethereum—and potentially the broader altcoin market—could be in the early stages.

However, the optimism is tempered by growing macroeconomic risks. Recent U.S. data has raised concerns about systemic fragility, with rising Treasury yields and persistent inflation fueling uncertainty across risk assets. Investors remain cautious as higher yields could limit liquidity flows into crypto, particularly into speculative altcoins.

According to Carl Runefelt, Ethereum's price structure is approaching a critical point. He highlights that ETH is currently trading within a rising wedge pattern—a bearish formation that often precedes a sharp pullback. Runefelt warns that if Ethereum fails to break decisively above the $2,700 resistance level soon, the price may reject and fall toward lower support, potentially leading to a drastic correction.

For now, Ethereum remains range-bound between $2,400 and $2,700. A confirmed breakout above the upper boundary could fuel continued bullish momentum and trigger a broader altcoin rally. But failure to hold current levels, especially with bearish macro pressure building, could signal that the recent gains were a temporary relief rally. Ethereum's next move will likely define the near-term direction for the entire altcoin sector.

ETH Faces Key Resistance Amid Rising Momentum

Ethereum is showing strength as it trades at $2,574.70, gaining over 2.2% in the last session. As shown in the 3-day chart, ETH has remained range-bound since early May, fluctuating between the $2,400 support and the $2,700 resistance. The latest move above the 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages (SMAs), currently at $2,226 and $2,644, respectively, signals growing bullish momentum. However, Ethereum still faces a significant challenge near the 200-day SMA, currently sitting at $2,791, right below the critical $2,800 liquidity level.

The price has tested this resistance zone multiple times without success, suggesting that a strong breakout above $2,700–$2,800 is needed to initiate an impulsive move higher. Volume remains stable, and ETH's ability to hold recent gains hints at continued accumulation, but a lack of decisive follow-through could signal buyer exhaustion.

If bulls manage to reclaim $2,800, it would open the door toward $3,000 and confirm a breakout from the multi-month range. On the downside, a failure to hold $2,500 could trigger a drop back toward $2,400 or even $2,200 if broader market conditions deteriorate. For now, ETH remains in a pivotal zone, and its next major move will likely determine broader altcoin momentum.

Two European companies — France's The Blockchain Group and the United Kingdom's Smarter Web Company — have expanded their Bitcoin holdings.

In a Monday announcement, The Blockchain Group said it acquired 116 Bitcoin (BTC) for about 10.7 million euros ($12.55 million), and the Smarter Web Company announced the purchase of 226.42 BTC for 17.9 million pounds ($24.34 million).

Following its latest purchase, The Blockchain Group's holdings total 1,904 BTC, acquired at an average price of $106,000 per coin. The Smarter Web Company's holdings have reached a total of 1,000 BTC, bought for an average price of $106,750.

The Blockchain Group's deputy CEO, Alexandre Laizet, wrote in an X post that the company has achieved a Bitcoin yield of 1,348.8% in 2025. The Smarter Web Company's announcement said the firm's Bitcoin yield year-to-date stands at 26,242%.

What is Bitcoin Yield?

Bitcoin yield is a shareholder-accretion metric created by the world's top corporate Bitcoin treasury, Strategy, when it was still called MicroStrategy. This metric measures how quickly a firm is increasing the amount of Bitcoin backing each fully diluted share by comparing the ratio.

Strategy introduced the concept in November 2024, describing it as a key performance indicator to “help assess the performance of its strategy of acquiring bitcoin in a manner the Company believes is accretive to shareholders.” The company wrote at the time that it “can be used to supplement an investor's understanding of the Company's decision to fund the purchase of bitcoin by issuing additional shares.”

Corporate Bitcoin treasuries on the rise

The new acquisitions follow a surge in corporate Bitcoin treasury activity driven by favorable market dynamics and the continued success of firms like Strategy, which was expected to report more than $13 billion in unrealized gains for the second quarter of 2025.

Those expectations were surpassed on Monday when Strategy reported $14 billion in unrealized gains on its holdings in the Q2 2025. Strategy purchased throughout the quarter, with its most recent acquisition of 4,980 Bitcoin for $531.1 million announced on June 30.

On Monday, Japan's top corporate Bitcoin treasury company, Metaplanet, acquired another 2,204 BTC for $237 million. This brings the company's total holdings to 15,555 BTC, purchased at an average price of around $99,985 a coin.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Lamborghini, the renowned Italian luxury sports car manufacturer, is set to make a groundbreaking entry into the metaverse with the debut of its Temerario sports car. The metaverse, a virtual world that enables human interaction, gaming, and transactions, often involves digital replicas of real-life items. This move by Lamborghini signifies a strategic shift towards embracing digital innovation and expanding its brand presence in the virtual realm.

The Temerario, a digital representation of Lamborghini's iconic sports car, will allow users to experience the thrill of owning and driving a Lamborghini in a virtual environment. This initiative not only caters to the growing interest in the metaverse but also provides a new avenue for Lamborghini to engage with its audience. By offering a digital version of its sports car, Lamborghini can reach a broader demographic, including those who may not have the means to own a physical Lamborghini but are enthusiastic about the brand.

Lamborghini is offering 590 Temerario streetcars and 10 of the GT3 counterparts for $300 apiece from July 11. The digital sportscars will be mintable on Wilder World, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea and Lamborghini's own Web3 platform Fast ForWorld. This move is part of a broader trend among luxury brands to leverage the metaverse for marketing and customer engagement. By creating a digital version of its sports car, Lamborghini can offer a unique and immersive experience to its fans, fostering a deeper connection with the brand.

The metaverse has emerged as a significant platform for luxury brands to explore new marketing strategies and customer engagement methods. Lamborghini's entry into this space is a testament to the brand's forward-thinking approach and its commitment to staying relevant in an ever-evolving digital landscape. The Temerario sports car in the metaverse will likely attract a tech-savvy audience, further enhancing Lamborghini's brand image as a pioneer in both the automotive and digital worlds.

This initiative is expected to generate significant buzz and excitement among Lamborghini enthusiasts and metaverse users alike, further solidifying the brand's position as a leader in the luxury automotive industry. The Temerario sports car in the metaverse is not just a digital replica; it is a symbol of Lamborghini's innovation and its ability to adapt to the changing times. The metaverse, a virtual reality world allowing humans to interact with each other, play games and transact, often involving digital version of real-life items, has seen a lot of hype during the digital asset bull market of 2021, but this faded considerably over the subsequent two years. However, Lamborghini is seemingly undeterred, teaming up with Web3 investment and development heavyweights Animoca Brands last year to create digital experiences for fans and customers.

 The social media company TikTok, which is currently appealing a £12.7 million fine imposed by Britain's data protection regulator, is set to hire one of that regulator's most senior officials in a move that could provoke concerns about conflicts of interest. 

 Stephen Bonner, the deputy commissioner for regulatory supervision at the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) — an official whom a senior colleague called “integral” to the ICO's work — is joining TikTok later this year as the head of the company's European data protection department. 

 It follows the ICO issuing TikTok the £12.7 million ($17.25 million) fine in 2023 for misusing children's data and launching in March what it called a “major investigation” into the social media platform's ongoing collection of children's data. 

 Bonner's move, which was first reported by Politico, has been criticised as an example of the so-called revolving-door for public servants moving from roles in which they held businesses to account into roles at those same regulated companies. Such moves risk what political scientists call regulatory capture, where the regulators unduly prioritize the interests of the sector they are supposed to be supervising. 

 Dozens of former public servants have moved into the private sector in fields that directly overlap with their previous roles — particularly in the social media and technology sectors — raising concerns about conflicts of interest, as a joint investigation by Tortoise Media and BBC News reported earlier this year. 

 “Stephen Bonner's move is the latest of a long list of cases where the ICO has failed to uphold decent standards of public life. Civil servants should use their position to pursue the public interest, not their own career goals,” said Mariano delli Santi, the legal and policy officer at digital rights campaigners Open Rights Group. 

 Paul Arnold, the deputy chief executive at the ICO, defended Bonner's move in a statement sent to Recorded Future News: “Stephen has been an integral part of our success for the past four years and we wish him all the best as he returns to the private sector. 

 “All former ICO employees in new employment are subject to strict legal and contractual duty of confidentiality, something set out in the Data Protection Act,” Arnold said. 

 The ICO's deputy chief executive stressed that Bonner had “stepped back fully from any piece of work where there could be a perceived or actual conflict of interest” while he worked out his notice period. 

 The agency stressed that Bonner was not the decision maker in the agency's 2023 investigation that led to the £12.7 million fine, nor was he the decision maker on the recent investigation into TikTok's content recommendation systems as they relate to children's data. It acknowledged that Bonner had been involved in the current investigation but was recused to avoid the perception of conflicts of interest. 

 “The ICO has a long and proud history of former employees using their experience and expertise to raise and maintain high standards of data protection as they continue to progress in their careers,” said Arnold. 

 Mariano delli Santi, the legal and policy officer at the U.K.-based Open Rights Group, noted: “When in opposition, Baroness Jones of Whitchurch proposed an amendment to the Data Bill that would have precluded ICO staff from joining businesses that were subject to public enforcement action.” 

 As submitted to parliament, the amendment would have prevented ICO staff “from seeking employment from the industries they regulated during their terms. It is to probe what steps the Government and ICO are taking to prevent the so-called ‘revolving door' between regulators and the industries they regulate.” 

 Delli Santi added that the Labour Party “scrapped this proposal once in government.” 

 “The Labour Party ran on a manifesto that promised to restore integrity in British public life, and the Data Bill could have been a vehicle to ensure the ICO protects people's rights rather than corporate and private interests'. The Labour government failed to seize this opportunity, and failed to deliver on their electoral promise as well,” she said. 

 Baroness Jones, who is now a junior minister at the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) which sponsors the independent ICO, did not personally respond to a request for comment. 

 A spokesperson for DSIT said: “The ICO is independent of government and accountable to Parliament. All current and former Staff at the ICO are bound by a statutory duty of confidentiality and are answerable to Parliament in pursuit of this duty. We expect all of these employees to work to the very highest standards and to fully observe their duty of confidentiality.” 

 TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Information Commissioner's Office has launched a consultation on a new enforcement approach designed to unlock privacy-preserving alternatives to the adtech business model, as it has emerged that firms which fall foul of the cookie law could face much tougher action.
The proposals, which were first mooted back in March even before the UK data reforms were passed, are set out in a call for views on how the ICO applies regulation 6 of the Privacy & Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) – aimed at supporting innovation by enabling new advertising models that respect user privacy while maintaining revenue streams.
The ICO is exploring how publishers could deliver privacy-preserving advertising to users who have not given consent, where the risks are demonstrably low. The regulator will continue to enforce consent requirements for the collection of personal information for targeted advertising.
ICO director of regulatory risk Stephen Almond said: “Online advertising doesn't have to come at the expense of privacy. We want to see industry develop new models that put users in control while supporting publishers and platforms to thrive.
“Our role isn't to dictate how that's done – it's to remove unnecessary regulatory barriers and open the door to responsible innovation.”
The ICO has also launched an updated consultation on its Storage & Access Technologies (SATs) guidance, revised to reflect changes introduced by the new Data (Use & Access) Act 2025. The Act permits consent-free use of cookies for certain low-risk functions, such as statistical analysis and website improvement.
The ICO is also commissioning further user research to better understand public attitudes to online tracking and consent, ensuring its regulatory approach is aligned with what it calls “real-world expectations”.
The call for views on the ICO's enforcement approach closes on 29 August 29, while the SATs guidance consultation closes on September 26. Responses will inform the ICO's final guidance and a formal statement on its updated enforcement approach, due in early 2026.
Over the past year, the ICO has issued 16 fines, totalling £1,667,500, for breaches of PECR, and, while many of these were for rogue telemarking activities, they also include action against firms for cookie violations.
As the law currently stands, a cookie contravention has to be both serious and likely to cause substantial damage or substantial distress before the ICO could even consider issuing a fine.
However, that is all set to change under the DUAA, according to Mischon de Reya senior data protection specialist Jon Baines. He points out that once section 115 and schedule 13 are commenced (at a date yet to be announced), both PECR and the Data Protection Act 2018 will be amended so that any contravention of regulation 6 of PECR is potentially subject to a fine.
The ICO will still have to have regard factors such as the nature, gravity and duration, and the intentional or negligent character of the contravention, but there will be no seriousness threshold and no “harm” threshold.
Baines explained: “So, does this mean that, when the amended powers come into effect, the ICO will be issuing a swathe of cookie fines? That seems unlikely: although the ICO has adopted an online tracking strategy, which involves assessing some large websites' compliance, there has been no indication that this strategy will lead to multiple fines being deployed.
“However, the possibility cannot be ruled out, especially if the ICO were to encounter cookie contraventions which are serious and egregious.”

JD.com and Ant Group have pressured the People's Bank of China to permit yuan-based stablecoins to counter the rise of USDC.

The companies suggest launching stablecoins in Hong Kong backed by the offshore yuan to improve the Chinese currency's global position. They are ready to issue Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoins once the local legislation begins on August 1st.

JD.com is pushing for offshore yuan stablecoins as a strategy to support yuan internationalisation. The initiative highlights China's goals to challenge the US's dominance in the digital finance landscape and expand the reach of its currency around the world.

However, China banned cryptocurrency transactions, including private stablecoins, a move which intensified in 2021 due to concerns regarding financial crime, capital flight, and potential threats to financial stability.

Nonetheless, as a response to Ant International and JD.com, China put effort into developing and piloting its own digital yuan (e-CNY) as a central bank digital currency. This CBDC is seen as a means to modernise the country's payment system and exert more control over its financial landscape.

If the companies' efforts are successful, the move would mark a change in the way Beijing interacts with cryptocurrencies and in the country's strategy of promoting the yuan. Stablecoin's blockchain technology enables instant and borderless transfers of funds at a low cost. This offers the stablecoins the potential to spread quickly and disrupt traditional cross-border systems.

The current stablecoin market is small, valued at USD 247 billion, according to CoinGecko. Another source, Standard Chartered Bank, estimated that it could grow to USD 2 trillion by 2028. However, one issue in China's goal to make the yuan a global currency through stablecoins is its reluctance to remove tight capital controls. The currency's share fell to 2.89% in May 2025, according to SWIFT, and many Chinese exporters use USD-pegged stablecoins as the USD commands a 48.46% of total market share.

BBVA has launched a Bitcoin and Ether trading and custody service for retail customers in Spain.

After completing a disclosure with the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV), the bank gradually rolled out its new service. Users can now trade in Bitcoin and Ether through the BBVA app within a fully integrated framework that includes all the bank's financial services.

As the bank is focused on offering a more comprehensive digital experience, the new service enables customers to buy, sell, and hold crypto in the BBVA mobile app. The move aligns with the European law MiCA, which regulates the issuance and provision of crypto-asset services within the EU and offers additional protection for investors. The bank will not provide investment advice on these assets, and access to the service will be exclusively customer-initiated through the app.

The bank wanted to make it easier for its customers in Spain to invest in cryptocurrency through a simple and user-friendly digital solution on their device. Its mission is to support the exploration and adoption of digital assets backed by security and compliance.

The initiative comes as BBVA received approval from the Spanish Securities and Exchange Commission (CNMV) to offer custody and execution of services for crypto trading orders in March 2025. As required by the MiCA, the bank completed the formalities with the CNMV and launched the solution initially for a small group of users, gradually extending it to all private customers in Spain.

BBVA has a decade worth of experience in blockchain technology. In 2021, it rolled out a Bitcoin trading desk and custody service for private banking clients in Switzerland, which later expanded to include Ether and USDC. In 2023, Garanti BBVA in Turkey set up a specialised company that now offers a wide range of crypto assets, including Bitcoin, Ether, USDC, Solana, XRP, AVAX, Chiliz, and others. Spain marks the third market where the bank grew its digital asset services.

Bitstamp, a cryptocurrency exchange owned by Robinhood, has secured a licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to operate as a Major Payment Institution.

The approval marks Bitstamp's formal entry into the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region and expands its global regulatory footprint, which already includes jurisdictions in the United States, the United Kingdom, and under the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation.

The exchange, which has been operating since 2011, positions its APAC strategy around local compliance, market connectivity, and infrastructure designed for institutional needs. Officials from Bitstamp noted that the Singapore team will handle market strategy, compliance, and partnerships, supporting regional clients through in-market operations.

Singapore was selected as the base of regional operations due to its regulatory clarity and established role in global finance. Bitstamp representatives said that securing the MAS licence is a foundational step in building trust and delivering services in line with local expectations.

According to the company, the APAC expansion brings access to global liquidity pools and cross-border trading with markets in the EU, UK, and the US. Bitstamp claims to offer fast fiat on/off ramps and multicurrency banking rails to facilitate entry and exit from crypto markets.

The firm also cites technical infrastructure as a key feature of its offering in the region, including low-latency APIs, institutional trading tools, and a matching engine powered by Nasdaq technology. Additionally, Bitstamp reports that it meets international security benchmarks such as ISO/IEC 27001 and SOC 2 Type 2 certifications and maintains a 99.9% service uptime.

Representatives from Bitstamp stated that the company's long-standing presence in the crypto industry and its regulatory record are expected to benefit institutions and retail users in APAC looking for stable and compliant access to digital asset markets.

Author :   				Sauradeep Bag


China's digital renminbi aims to chip away at the dollar's dominance and reshape the global monetary order.

China has maintained a cautious stance toward unregulated digital assets, in contrast to the United States, which has demonstrated a more permissive and innovation-driven approach to cryptocurrency adoption. As global geopolitics potentially shift toward a multipolar configuration, a corresponding transformation is emerging in the international monetary system, where multiple sovereign currencies may increasingly coexist and compete for global prominence.

In this context, the Governor of the People's Bank of China, Pan Gongsheng, recently announced the establishment of an international operations centre for the digital renminbi (RMB) in Shanghai. This initiative reflects China's strategic intent to internationalise its central bank digital currency (CBDC), particularly by expanding its role in trade finance. Amid concerns over the volatility of the US dollar, exacerbated by Washington's increasingly unpredictable trade policy, there is a growing inclination among enterprises to diversify trade settlements using alternative currencies, including the yuan. Nevertheless, the entrenched dominance of the US dollar continues to present a formidable challenge to any meaningful shift in the global monetary hierarchy. Calls for greater diversification in global currency usage have been a consistent feature of statements from Chinese central bank officials. 

The digital renminbi remains a top strategic priority for China, with a series of steady and deliberate developments advancing its rollout over time. The People's Bank of China's Digital Currency Research Institute reported that approximately 180 million individual digital RMB wallets had been opened, amounting to nearly one in every eight Chinese citizens. In terms of strategic implications, PBoC officials have acknowledged the role of US dollar–denominated stablecoins in reinforcing the dollar's dominance in the international monetary system. The PBoC disclosures indicate the progress of its CBDC pilot, the digital renminbi (e-CNY). By the end of June 2025, cumulative transaction volumes reached RMB 7 trillion (US$988 billion). These instruments not only bolster dollar liquidity but also risk further entrenching its status in global reserves, potentially slowing down ongoing diversification efforts.

To counterbalance this trend, proposals have emerged from within China advocating for the launch of an offshore renminbi-denominated stablecoin. Such a development could serve as a meaningful mechanism to advance the internationalisation of the yuan by enhancing its utility in global trade and finance. At the same time, concerns persist over the structural advantage enjoyed by US dollar stablecoins, particularly due to their deep liquidity, which poses challenges for the emergence of competing stablecoins in other currencies. The e-CNY pilot has now expanded to 17 provinces across China.

Former People's Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan emphasised the importance of critically examining whether the global expansion of ‘dollarisation', particularly through digital financial instruments, is desirable. He underscored the need to assess its broader economic implications, especially for countries outside the United States.

Recent comments from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reflect this accelerating trend, as he projected that the market for US dollar-pegged stablecoins could exceed US$2 trillion. Such growth would likely entrench the dollar's role within the global financial architecture, reinforcing its dominance across international financial markets.

In 2021, Beijing implemented a comprehensive ban on cryptocurrency mining. That same year, Chinese regulators declared all cryptocurrency-related commercial activities illegal. The rationale behind these stringent measures is rooted in concerns over financial instability, capital outflows, and the potential use of cryptocurrencies for illicit activities, including money laundering.

Despite this restrictive stance on private digital currencies, the Chinese government continues to promote the development and integration of blockchain technologies. These efforts extend across a range of state-backed initiatives, including supply chain management, financial infrastructure, and public service delivery, underscoring a strategic preference for sovereign and regulated applications of distributed ledger technologies.

In contrast, the United States has begun to formalise its engagement with the digital asset ecosystem. President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile.” This initiative aims to centralise and manage cryptocurrencies seized through criminal and civil asset forfeitures under federal jurisdiction. According to official statements, the strategy is intended to strengthen the US position in the digital financial domain by leveraging stablecoins and other cryptocurrency instruments to deepen the integration of the US dollar within global financial systems. This move is also perceived as a countermeasure against ongoing efforts by geopolitical rivals such as China and Russia to promote alternative currency frameworks that reduce reliance on the dollar. President Trump stated that the US dollar would maintain its stability over the long term, highlighting the government's digital asset holdings as a cornerstone of what he described as a future-oriented model for economic growth.

 

Recent regulatory developments in Hong Kong signal a strengthening of the city's approach to virtual asset governance. On May 21, the Legislative Council passed the Stablecoins Bill, formally establishing a licensing framework for fiat-referenced stablecoin (FRS) issuers. This initiative is designed to enhance oversight of virtual asset (VA) activities, promote financial stability, and support responsible financial innovation within Hong Kong's jurisdiction. In parallel, there is some speculation that the PBoC could leverage Hong Kong as a testing ground for cross-border digital payment mechanisms aimed at supporting the internationalisation of the renminbi.

China is increasingly advancing strategies to facilitate greater international use of the renminbi, particularly among foreign institutions, amid growing global concerns over the long-term stability of the US dollar. These efforts extend beyond investment products to include the establishment of a comprehensive offshore infrastructure, such as a network of yuan-clearing banks, and the development of the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), which serves as an alternative to SWIFT for facilitating renminbi-denominated transactions.

A notable trend has emerged wherein Chinese financial institutions are increasingly extending credit in yuan rather than US dollars. This shift is driven in part by the relative cost advantages of yuan-denominated lending and is reflective of Beijing's broader objective to reduce dependence on dollar-based financing structures.

These developments align with a wider regional recalibration in Asia, where a gradual move away from the US dollar is underway. This shift is being propelled by a confluence of factors, including heightened geopolitical tensions, evolving monetary policy landscapes, and a growing reliance on currency hedging instruments to mitigate volatility. Policy unpredictability under Trump has further exacerbated uncertainty surrounding the dollar, contributing to capital reallocation and diminished investor confidence in the currency.

In this context, China's advancement of the digital yuan represents a strategic pillar within its broader agenda for renminbi internationalisation. While the Chinese government has maintained a prohibitive stance toward cryptocurrencies, enacting a comprehensive ban on all related commercial activities, recent regulatory developments in Hong Kong present a noteworthy divergence. The introduction of the world's first licensing framework for fiat-referenced stablecoins positions Hong Kong as a potential regulatory sandbox for digital financial innovation. This framework offers Beijing an indirect mechanism to experiment with emerging digital payment instruments and assess their potential to bolster the renminbi's global standing, all while preserving stringent oversight within its domestic financial system. China's ‘de-dollarisation' efforts and its protracted trade tensions with the US further underscore the geopolitical and monetary motivations underpinning these digital currency initiatives.

Is Bitcoin merely a digital currency, or is it a transformative financial instrument? Michael Saylor's bold foray into Bitcoin acquisition is challenging traditional corporate perceptions of digital assets and shaking up the financial fabric of our economy. His company, Strategy, has taken a proactive stance by amassing vast reserves of Bitcoin, raising eyebrows and awakening interest in how such investments might alter the essence of corporate finance itself.

Let's talk numbers—Michael Saylor has propelled his firm's Bitcoin holdings to an astonishing 597,325 BTC, a treasure trove valued at nearly $64.57 billion. Utilizing a dollar-cost averaging strategy, Saylor ensures his company acquires Bitcoin weekly, skillfully avoiding the pitfalls of market instability. With a target of reaching 600,000 BTC, he is on an unyielding mission that positions Strategy as a trailblazer among Fortune 500s diving into the digital currency waters.

Saylor's aggressive strategy is creating waves, enticing a slew of corporations to follow suit. Recently, 18 companies, including Figma, collectively grabbed about 8,400 BTC. This surge in corporate interest signals a budding trend in corporate Bitcoin adoption, which could potentially lead to a significant disruption in supply, constraining Bitcoin's availability and inflating prices. As firms scramble to secure their stake in Bitcoin, the ownership landscape is evolving faster than many anticipated.

Saylor isn't just bullish on Bitcoin; he's practically a cheerleader for its future potential, going so far as to declare, ""In 21 years, you'll wish you'd bought more."" His conviction echoes the historical norm: corporate buying frenzies tend to propel prices skyward. Analysts are increasingly betting on these acquisition movements, citing a powerful synergy between corporate strategies and Bitcoin valuations that could veer into bullish territory in a heartbeat.

However, the corporate embrace of Bitcoin comes with sobering implications. Small Web3 startups face daunting challenges as these financial behemoths stake their claims. The established firms may inadvertently squeeze liquidity and create barriers for nascent companies struggling to forge essential banking connections. The stakes are rising, forcing critical reexamination of regulatory frameworks and the adaptability of decentralized financial systems amidst this corporate dominance. Will decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) still thrive as giants take their place in the spotlight?

The corporate fascination with Bitcoin, led by figures like Saylor, could very well reshape its valuation landscape entirely. As institutional heavyweights grip onto substantial Bitcoin amounts, we may witness fundamental shifts that tighten liquidity. Startups and offshore crypto entities will need to navigate these changing waters, aligning their financial operations with the criteria of these larger players to successfully ride the incoming waves.

In Saylor's pursuit of 600,000 BTC, we stand at a crucial juncture in cryptocurrency history. His strategies are solidifying Bitcoin's reputation as a trustworthy value store while fostering an increasingly aggressive corporate acquisition environment. The implications for market maneuvers, regulatory landscapes, and the positioning of smaller players are profound. The coming months are set to be defining; stakeholders must be ready to adapt swiftly to the sweeping surge of corporate Bitcoin investments. The momentum is undeniable, and as we look toward the horizon, it is clear that the future of the cryptocurrency realm is on the brink of radical evolution.

                    U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a press conference at the NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, on June 25, 2025
                                          | Photo Credit: REUTERS
                                      

Crypto scammers are running deepfake videos of U.S. President Donald Trump as YouTube Live videos, in what seems to be an attempt to steal investors' Bitcoin.

Multiple ‘live' YouTube videos featured Mr. Trump at what seemed to be a NATO press event. There, he was seen urging viewers to scan a QR code on the screen and send their Bitcoin to the specified location in order to get back double the amount. 

The background of the video looked just like that of the NATO's summit in the Netherlands on June 25. However, media outlets did not report on the U.S. President promoting any Bitcoin giveaways at the time. The videos were also not shared by any official White House channels. In some such videos, Mr. Trump incorrectly refers to himself as the 45th U.S. President. The provided links also change across some videos.



                            Screengrab of the deepfake video of Mr. Trump promoting crypto; cropped to obscure a fraudulent QR code and link
                                                            | Photo Credit: 
                                YouTube
                                                    

Throughout the morphed video, which had a QR code and instructions saying ‘Scan QR or regret' inserted into the visuals, Mr. Trump repeatedly urged viewers to send their Bitcoin without hesitation and get more money back as soon as they could.

He also gave a speech praising America's progress with Bitcoin, digital money, and energy. 

While some of the YouTube Live videos had been suspended when checked later, many duplicate versions of the video were still live and running, with some recording thousands of viewers or followers.

Mr. Trump's voice and style of speaking in the videos were highly believable, and at first glance it did not look as if his lips were being artificially synced to match the venture he was promoting.

Crypto security experts have long decried the persistent trend of celebrity deepfakes being uploaded as YouTube Live videos in order to fool crypto investors.

Blockchain analytics platform Elliptic also recently released its report observing that AI tools such as chatbots and deepfake software made it easier to launch crypto crimes and scams.

Mr. Trump had positioned himself as a crypto-friendly president in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election, which helped boost his popularity with fintech entrepreneurs and more conservative crypto traders.

He has also been linked to the World Liberty Financial project as well as a Trump meme coin, often confusing his followers and fans who are not always sure which Trump-related crypto ventures are legitimate.

Investors in Romania are interested in technology companies, cryptocurrency assets, US Treasuries and niche sectors, complemented by ETFs with a focus on diversification, technology and high-yield bonds, according to an analysis by the trading platform Freedom24.

Top picks included NVIDIA, a global leader in GPUs, Taiwan Semiconductor, the world's largest chip manufacturer, and Microsoft. Tesla remained a top pick for those looking to benefit from the green energy and electric vehicle boom.

The crypto wave, amplified by media hype, also made its mark on Romanians' investment choices. MicroStrategy, recognized for its significant Bitcoin holdings, became a popular option among those seeking indirect exposure to digital assets. 

The overall list reflects a mix of speculative bets on innovation (AI, crypto) and defensive assets (bonds, broad market), which is in line with Romania's economy as a fast-growing EU country. These results come from a survey of approximately 2,800 Romanian users over the past year.

Romanian retail investors also ventured into niche sectors such as maritime shipping or biotech. They made speculative bets on Castor Maritime, a shipping company, and TherapeuticsMD, a pharmaceutical firm specializing in women's health.

Meanwhile, conservative investors who preferred stability and lower-risk assets gravitated toward fixed-income products like bonds and dividend-paying stocks. Popular bond investments included EuroBond USA Notes 3.375%, maturing in May 2033, and EuroBond USA Bonds 4.125%, maturing in August 2053. AT&T, the telecom giant, also drew interest for its reliable high-dividend payouts.

One of the main reasons Romanian investors chose ETFs was to gain diversification or broad market exposure. Two of the most popular picks were the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF and the SPY.US (SPDR S&P 500 ETF), both tracking the U.S. market. For a more cost-efficient option, many chose VUAA.EU (Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF), a low-fee alternative that delivers the same exposure.

Investors looking beyond US borders opted for VWCE.EU (Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF).

Technology and growth-focused ETFs remained a key area of interest. Top picks were QQQM.US (Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF), VUG.US (Vanguard Growth ETF), and AMDY.US (YieldMax AMD Option Income Strategy ETF).

High-yield ETFs also attracted strong interest, especially among income-seeking investors. Two standouts in this category were EMHY.US (iShares J.P. Morgan EM High Yield Bond ETF), which provides exposure to emerging markets high-yield bonds and ULTY.US (YieldMax Ultra Option Income ETF), an ETF appealing to active investors, that leverages options to maximize income.

Rising global tensions prompted some investors to shift funds into DFNS.EU, an ETF focused on defense-sector companies, as governments ramped up military spending.

For long-term investors focused on capital preservation, VUAA, VWCE, and SPY remained core holdings. Their broad diversification and historical resilience made them reliable choices, especially during volatile market conditions.

(Reuters) -CoreWeave will buy crypto miner Core Scientific in an all-stock deal valued at about $9 billion, it said on Monday, as AI infrastructure firms race to secure the energy and data center capacity needed to power surging demand.

Bitcoin miners' energy-intensive sites and power contracts, built during the crypto boom, have emerged as prime targets for AI companies expanding their computing infrastructure.

The deal will help in the immediate elimination of more than $10 billion of cumulative future lease overhead to be paid for existing contractual sites over the next 12 years, CoreWeave said.

The offer values Core Scientific at $20.40 per share, representing a premium of around 66% to the stock's closing price before reports of deal talks surfaced in late June.

Core Scientific's shares fell 22% in morning trading, while Nvidia-backed CoreWeave was last down 4.5%. 

Core Scientific stockholders will receive 0.1235 newly issued CoreWeave stock for each share they hold.

""This acquisition accelerates our strategy to deploy AI and HPC (high-performance computing) workloads at scale,"" said CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator. 

The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter, and the final price will be determined at that time. 

PIVOT GATHERS PACE

Bitcoin miners have tapped into the AI boom to diversify beyond cryptocurrency, leasing power and data center space to meet soaring demand from AI workloads.

The acquisition is expected to set the bar for bitcoin miners looking to pivot to AI, Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani told Reuters, adding that power remains the biggest constraint for AI data center expansion. 

""CoreWeave gets full control of Core Scientific's entire 1.3 GW power contracted and future pipeline,"" Chhugani said. 

Founded as an Ethereum-focused crypto miner in 2017, CoreWeave pivoted to AI a few years later. It shuttered its mining business after ""The Merge"", Ethereum's 2022 upgrade, slashed rewards for miners. 

CoreWeave's revenue has grown at breakneck speed, climbing more than eight-fold last year, according to its IPO prospectus. 

The deal also marks a turnaround for Core Scientific, which filed for bankruptcy in late 2022 following a sharp drop in bitcoin prices and soaring energy costs.  

The company emerged from bankruptcy in early 2024 and, like several other bitcoin miners, has looked to lean on the AI boom to power growth.

Core Scientific first received an unsolicited, non-binding takeover offer from CoreWeave in June 2024. At the time, the company rejected the offer, saying it was significantly undervalued.

The two companies later signed a series of 12-year contracts, including one under which Core Scientific agreed to provide CoreWeave with about 200 MW of infrastructure to power its high-performance computing services.

CoreWeave, which provides access to data centers and Nvidia-powered AI chips, has a market value of about $79 billion, according to LSEG data.

Goldman Sachs is CoreWeave's adviser, while Moelis and PJT Partners are the financial advisers to Core Scientific.

This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

The consensus in the bitcoin BTC$108,256.07 market remains bullish even though the price has held above $100,000 every day bar one for two months, with analysts' projections for resistance levels ranging from $140,000 to over $200,000.

One way to identify such levels is to use trendlines, which are price chart lines connecting major highs and lows. They provide visual cues about momentum and direction, helping traders identify support and resistance levels.

Connecting the 2017 bull-market high of around $20,000 and the 2021 high of nearly $70,000 and extending the line forward can help highlight the level where selling pressure might emerge. 

As of the time of writing, this trendline indicates resistance at approximately $115,300, according to the data source TradingView.

The same trendline capped upside in December and January, paving the way for a correction that saw prices drop to a low of $75,000 in April.

That said, the above chart is a linear-scaled or arithmetic-scaled monthly chart. It shows the absolute price changes, a feature that makes it suitable for analyzing short-term trends.

The potential resistance price, however, may be less reliable than that derived from the long-scaled chart, which compresses significant percentage moves, making trendlines and resistance levels more precise and more meaningful.

Connecting the 2017 and 2021 highs on the log-scaled monthly chart aligns the resistance at approximately $223,000, rather than $115,000. The log-scaled trendline resistance is likely more consistent with the exponential growth pattern of bitcoin's past bull markets.

Elon Musk plans to form a pro-tech centrist party called the 'America Party' after splitting from President Trump.

The America Party would embrace Bitcoin and focus on House and Senate races rather than the Presidential election.

Musk criticizes Trump's 'Big Beautiful Bill' as fiscally irresponsible, calling it the 'debt slavery bill.'

Elon Musk's 'America Party', a pro-tech centrist party the Tesla and SpaceX founder plans to form after his split from President Donald Trump, would embrace bitcoin BTC$108,256.07 Musk said on X.

@elonmusk, will America Party embrace Bitcoin?

Musk has been a long supporter of cryptocurrencies, with SpaceX and Tesla both holding BTC in their corporate treasuries.

The America Party formed out of a rift between Musk and President Trump over the 'Big Beautiful Bill' which Musk has criticized as being fiscally irresponsible, calling it the ""debt slavery bill"".

Musk envisions the party, which has not yet been officially registered, as one which takes a pro-tech, pro-free speech and anti-regulation agenda, with centrist policies everywhere else.

The America Party doesn't yet have an official website, so all that's known about its political ideology comes from Musk's posts and re-tweets from supporters.

Musk has said on X that the party, when formed, won't immediately run a Presidential candidate but rather focus on House and Senate races.

Trump, for his part, said in a Truth Social post Sunday evening U.S. time that Musk had gone ""off the rails"" and has become a ""TRAIN WRECK.""

Bitcoin BTC$108,256.07 whales, investors who already hold in excess of 10,000 BTC, are buying up more of the largest cryptocurrency in a sign of confidence in further upside even as the price sits just a few percent below its all-time high around $112,000.

The whales have shifted into aggressive accumulation mode over the past few days, as have wallets holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC. Smaller holders, however, appear to be reducing their exposure, according to Glassnode's Trend Accumulation Score.

Whales are often considered to be the ""smart money"" because they have so much at stake. The smaller investors range from sub-1 BTC wallets to those holding between 10 and 100 BTC and have mostly been selling or distributing their holdings over the past couple of months. 

The contrast, which comes as the bitcoin price sits around $109,000 potentially signals a transfer of coins from retail to institutional or high-net-worth investors. The accumulation trend score confirms strong buying interest started building shortly after bitcoin hit a local low near $76,000 in mid-April.

That's further evidence the whales' accumulation near record price levels could be a bullish signal and they may be positioning for future growth.

 US President Donald Trump has blasted Elon Musk's plan to start a new political party that could splinter the Republican vote in the 2026 midterm elections. 

US President Donald Trump has lashed out at his former cost-cutting czar, Elon Musk, after the world's wealthiest man said he is launching a political party to challenge the US two-party system. 

“I am saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely ‘off the rails,' essentially becoming a TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform on Sunday, hours after Musk declared he had formed the “America Party.”

“He even wants to start a Third Political Party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States — The System seems not designed for them,” he added.

Musk's new party threatens to fracture the Republican vote as he has threatened to target key seats leading up to the midterm elections next year, which would include aiming to unseat some Republicans.

However, while third parties — those other than the Democratic and Republican parties — have seen some success at electing state and local officials, a third party hasn't won a presidential election since the Republican Party became a major party in 1856.

Musk posted to his X platform on Sunday that he was forming the “America Party.” He had promised to create it if Congress passed Trump's massive tax and spending bill, which it did on Thursday.

Multiple political parties referencing the America Party, DOGE, or X were filed with the Federal Election Commission after Musk's post, which listed him as affiliated with the entity. Musk confirmed that at least one of the filings was fake, while some on social media have questioned the legitimacy of others. 

Musk has taken issue with the spending allowance in the Republican-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act, calling it a “disgusting abomination,” as it's estimated to add $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.

Before the bill passed, Musk threatened that he'd look to unseat any lawmakers who supported the bill, saying they would “lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.”

It's the latest in the public spat between Musk and Trump that started in late May, just before Musk finished up his special government employee role at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, named in homage to the cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE).

Musk has claimed the bill undermines DOGE's work to cut government spending.

Trump's biggest backers are seemingly worried that Musk's America Party could cause the Republican vote to splinter in the midterm elections next year, risking the party's thin majority in Congress.

Third parties rarely threaten the Republicans and Democrats, but Musk has the money to potentially influence next year's elections if he follows through with his plan.

The US has a first-past-the-post election system, meaning the candidate with the most first-preference votes wins even if they don't get a majority of the votes.

Some of Trump's most loyal backers are seemingly concerned that the America Party could win over would-be Republican voters, splitting the party's base and risking the GOP's majority or allowing Democrat candidates to win.

Related: Bitcoin to benefit from Trump's ‘Big Beautiful Bill,' analysts predict 

Laura Loomer, a far-right influencer close to Trump, said on X that high-profile Republicans, including Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie, could defect to Musk's new party.

Musk posted to X on Friday that his party planned to focus on winning a few key House and Senate seats, which he claimed would be enough to block Republican or Democratic agendas.

“One way to execute on this would be to laser-focus on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts.”

“Given the razor-thin legislative margins, that would be enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws, ensuring that they serve the true will of the people,” he added.

 Bitcoin trades 2% below ATH as analysts eye new records amid looming US tariff deadline and upcoming “Crypto Week” volatility. 

Bitcoin could set a new record high as early as this week, with all eyes trained on the United States' trade tariff deadline on Wednesday, which could unlock risk appetite, along with an upcoming “Crypto Week” in the country's capital. 

“Bitcoin is likely to set a new all-time high this week or next,” the head of research at 10x Research, Markus Thielen, told Cointelegraph on Monday. 

He added that post-July 4th seasonality “tends to be bullish, and markets have largely shrugged off tariff-related risks.”

July 9 is the deadline when the 90-day pause in US reciprocal tariffs ends. 

“If the US postpones the tariffs again, markets might interpret this as a reluctance to implement them, and it will support risk appetite,” UBS Global Wealth Management analysts said in a note, according to The Wall Street Journal. 

“Bitcoin looks to be setting up for an upside breakout,” concurred John Bollinger, inventor of the Bollinger Bands technical trading indicator, on Sunday. 

Bitcoin (BTC) prices were only 2% away from their May 22 all-time high, briefly topping $109,500 on Monday trading.  

“It will likely be a volatile week,” Apollo Capital's chief investment officer, Henrik Andersson, told Cointelegraph.

“We do believe there is a good chance that the US will sign a framework agreement with the EU this week,” he added. 

Andersson also mentioned that Elon Musk had just mentioned Bitcoin on X, “as it seems like he is warming up to the asset again.” 

“Any downside volatility this week could be a good buying opportunity ahead of next week, which has been designated as ‘Crypto Week' in [Washington] DC,” he concluded. 

Traders were previously concerned about volatility leading up to the July 9 tariff deadline, observed Jeff Mei, chief operating officer at the BTSE exchange. 

However, “it looks like markets are rallying after it was revealed countries will have more time to negotiate before tariffs take effect at the beginning of August,” he told Cointelegraph, adding, “If we see good numbers on Tuesday, then it's likely that markets will continue to rally.”

Crypto markets had gained more than $50 billion in total capitalization over the past 24 hours following a relatively flat weekend, according to CoinGecko. 

Meanwhile, Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told Cointelegraph that traders may “look to altcoins for upside potential as the second half of this year is anticipated for higher volatility and surges in digital asset prices.”

Eugene Cheung, chief commercial officer at digital assets platform OSL, told Cointelegraph, “We're optimistic that more investors will look to Bitcoin and Ethereum to escape macro volatility and potential inflation increases as the Fed signals high potential to cut interest rates this year.”

 Block CEO Jack Dorsey has released a white paper and launched a beta for Bitchat, a decentralized messaging app using Bluetooth mesh networks for internet-free, encrypted communication. 

Block CEO and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has launched the beta version of a new decentralized peer-to-peer messaging service that runs entirely over Bluetooth. 

Jack Dorsey said his weekend was spent learning about “Bluetooth mesh networks, relays, store and forward models, message encryption models, and a few other things” as he introduced Bitchat on X on Sunday. 

The “Bluetooth mesh chat” system has “IRC [Internet Relay Chat] vibes,” Dorsey added, harking back to the early days of web-based messaging systems in the late 1990s. 

His white paper goes into more detail about Bitchat, which is a decentralized messaging application that operates over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh networks.

According to the white paper, the network would be fully decentralized with no central servers, accounts, email addresses, phone numbers to register, or infrastructure dependencies. 

It provides “ephemeral messaging,” whereby messages exist only in device memory by default and are not stored on a central database. There is also end-to-end encryption for an extra layer of security. 

Current popular messaging applications such as WhatsApp and Messenger are run by social media giants such as Meta, which are centralized, profit-driven corporations that use personal and message data as a product.

Meanwhile, mesh networking enables automatic multi-hop message relaying, and room-based chat can be set up with hashtag-named group chats and optional password protection. A “store-and-forward” system caches messages for offline peers for set time periods. 

In April, Cointelegraph reported that some popular social messaging apps could be spying on users, hoovering up personal information and messages. 

Each device acts as both client and peripheral, creating a self-organizing mesh where messages can hop between devices to reach distant peers. The system uses a 30-meter Bluetooth range with bridge nodes connecting separate clusters.

Messages are encrypted based on whether they are private, in a room, or broadcast, and large messages are fragmented into smaller 500-byte chunks. 

There are future plans to enable messaging over WiFi, which will increase the bandwidth for large messages. 

The system has several use cases, such as conferences, protests, disaster areas, or any scenario where internet infrastructure is unavailable, unreliable, or untrusted.

The paper concluded that Bitchat demonstrates that secure, private messaging is possible without centralized infrastructure, and stated: 

Dorsey is no stranger to messaging protocols, having served as the CEO of Twitter while founding the decentralized social messaging platform Bluesky in 2019. He left the Bluesky board without explanation in May 2024.

 Elon Musk announced the formation of a new political party on Sunday, telling one of his followers on X that it will embrace Bitcoin as “fiat is hopeless.” 

Tesla CEO and tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has confirmed that his newly formed political party — the America Party — will accept Bitcoin.

“Fiat is hopeless, so yes,” Musk replied to an X user who asked if his new party would embrace Bitcoin.

Elon Musk is no stranger to Bitcoin as Tesla was an early adopter, holding BTC in its treasury.

Under his leadership as Tesla CEO, Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of BTC in early 2021, making it one of the first publicly traded companies to hold Bitcoin in its treasury reserves.

Currently, Tesla holds 11,509 BTC, worth approximately $1.26 billion, with the EV maker being the ninth-largest publicly traded company to hold Bitcoin in its treasury, according to Bitbo.

The Tesla CEO has also supported Dogecoin over the years, which has caused the price of the memecoin to either rally or crash after his tweets.

Jan3 founder Samson Mow said embracing Bitcoin could give Musk an edge over Trump in their ongoing feud.

Mow stated that Tesla should once again start accepting Bitcoin as payment and that Musk's SpaceX should give discounts to those who pay in Bitcoin.

In 2024, Musk rejected the idea of using the Bitcoin network as a form of payment on Mars. However, Musk later entertained the idea, saying that a localized Lightning Network could solve the issue of slow transactions.

Musk has not always been pro-Bitcoin. In 2021, he claimed that the price of Bitcoin was “too high,” which led to BTC dropping in price.

Musk's relationship with Donald Trump has deteriorated over Trump's “One Big Beautiful Bill,” with Musk previously calling it “utterly insane and destructive” and arguing that it will erode millions of jobs in the US and cause “immense strategic harm” to the country.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is estimated to add $3.3 trillion to the US national debt over the next decade.

Musk questioned Trump's rationale for creating the DOGE, an initiative that aims at reducing the US national debt, if he was going to increase the national debt by trillions of dollars.

He later hinted that the US needs a new political party that “actually cares about the people.”

On Sunday, Musk announced that he would be creating the America Party after more than 1.24 million people voted on his poll over whether he should create the party, with nearly two-thirds of voters voting in favor of the new party. 

“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk added.

US President Donald Trump has since lashed out at Musk for creating a third political party. Trump said that Musk's new party could fracture the Republican vote at the 2026 US midterm elections.

Texas Flood Forecasts Were Accurate but Not Sufficient to Save Lives

The National Weather Service issued timely alerts, meteorologists say, but few were listening in the hours before the early-morning flash floods along the Guadalupe River

By Chelsea Harvey & E&E News 

Widespread damage is visible in and around Kerrville, Texas, on July 6, 2025, following a deadly flash flood that caused the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in less than an hour.

CLIMATEWIRE | The catastrophic floods that struck central Texas on Friday show that accurate weather forecasts alone aren't enough to save lives.

The National Weather Service issued timely warnings in advance of the deadly floods, meteorologists say. But they emphasized that forecasts are only one piece of an effective response — local authorities must be able to interpret weather warnings, communicate them to the public and help communities get to safety in time.

Now more than 80 people are dead, with dozens more missing across the region as of Monday morning, including at least 10 campers and a counselor from Camp Mystic summer camp on the banks of the flooded Guadalupe River.

Experts are still piecing together the reasons why.

“I think this situation needs to be reviewed, both from a forecast and warning perspective and from a decision support perspective,” said Louis Uccellini, former director of the National Weather Service. “That involves a lot of work.”

Authorities have resorted to finger-pointing in the wake of the floods.

Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly, the county's top elected official, said at a press conference on Friday that “we didn't know this kind of flood was coming.” Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd suggested at a separate press conference that NWS forecasts fell short in advance of the floods.

Experts say that isn't true.

Meteorologists can see extreme thunderstorms coming days ahead, but it's notoriously hard to pinpoint the exact amount of rain they'll produce, or how long they will linger in place, so far in advance. Meteorologists have to update their forecasts as better information becomes available.

In the case of last week's floods, NWS began to escalate its warnings as much as 12 hours in advance, issuing flood watches beginning Thursday afternoon and upgrading to a flash flood warning by 1a.m. local time Friday, with more urgent warnings following into the early morning.

“There have been claims that NOAA/NWS did not foresee catastrophic TX floods — but that's simply not true,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA in a lengthy Bluesky thread defending the NWS weather forecasts.

Still, Swain added that “even quite good weather forecasts do not automatically translate into life-saving predictions — there's a lot of other work that has to take place to contextualize the forecast and ensure it gets to [the] right people.”

Vacancies in top roles at some local NWS offices serving affected communities in Texas are cause for concern, some experts say.

The NWS office in San Angelo, which serves some of the hardest-hit communities, has no permanent meteorologist in charge, according to a list of vacancies published by the agency in June. And the Austin/San Antonio office, also serving flooded communities, is missing its warning coordination meteorologist and a science and operations officer, according to the same list.

These roles often serve as liaisons between NWS meteorologists and local authorities or emergency managers. Warning coordination meteorologists, in particular, help translate forecasts into usable action plans that can aid the local authorities who make decisions and evacuate communities as severe weather systems approach.

It's unclear whether those vacancies have affected coordination with local authorities. Top meteorologists at NWS San Angelo and NWS Austin/San Antonio did not immediately respond to questions about whether the openings posed any challenges during the floods.

But Tom Fahy, legislative director at the union that represents NWS employees, said in an interview that vacancies at the Texas offices did not cause any problems during the floods.

The offices called “all hands on deck” to ensure that they were fully staffed during the emergency, he said, adding that “they knew this was a critical life and death situation — bodies and lives were on the line in this one.”

NOAA spokesperson Erica Grow Cei provided a timeline of NWS warnings between Thursday and Friday, confirming that the first flood watch went out at 1:18 p.m. local time Thursday and the first flash flood warning was issued at 11:41 p.m. for Bandera County. Another flash flood warning — tagged “considerable” to indicate a threat of major damage — was issued at 1:14 a.m. for Bandera and Kerr counties, triggering wireless emergency alerts on enabled devices and warnings on NOAA Weather Radio.

“National Weather Service is heartbroken by the tragic loss of life in Kerr County,” Cei said in an emailed statement, adding that the agency ""remains committed to our mission to serve the American public through our forecasts and decision support services.”

Still, cellphone and radio alerts aren't always enough to prevent loss of life during disasters. They can't help people who disable their alerts, don't have cellphone service or don't have radios.

Late-night and early-morning warnings can be an even greater challenge to distribute, when much of the public is asleep. Friday's floods occurred in the early hours of the morning, with the most urgent warnings issued after 1 a.m.

“The crux of this disaster is a failure of the last mile of communication,” Fahy said. “The forecasts went out, they communicated the forecasts, they disseminated the watches and warnings. And the dilemma we have is there was nobody listening at 4 o'clock in the morning for these watches and warnings.”

Most people who died in Friday's floods were located in Kerr County, which does not have a warning system, according to Kelly, the Kerry County judge, at a Friday news conference. Other cities in central Texas, like San Marcos, deploy outdoor weather sirens to warn of extreme weather events like floods and tornadoes, as local news reports have pointed out.

In an interview with The New York Times, Kelly suggested that warning systems are expensive and “taxpayers won't pay for it.”

Questions also remain about disaster protocols at Camp Mystic, where at least 11 people remained missing as of Sunday afternoon.

A policy on the camp's website suggests that campers are not permitted to have cellphones, smart watches, iPads or other devices with touchscreens. It's unclear whether counselors had access to devices equipped with emergency alerts or whether the camp had access to a NOAA weather radio.

When asked Friday why nearby summer camps weren't evacuated in a timely manner, Kelly told reporters, “I can't answer that.”

Friday's floods have reignited concerns among scientists and disaster specialists about the impacts of the Trump administration's cuts to federal agencies tasked with responding to extreme weather events.

Hurricane season began last month amid widespread chaos at NOAA and FEMA. Experts have warned that smaller disasters, like extreme thunderstorms and floods, are also likely to strain the federal government's disaster response systems this summer.

That comes as extreme rainfall events and floods grow more intense as the climate warms.

Record-breaking rainfall, like the kind that caused the Texas floods, is exactly the kind of event “which is increasing the fastest in [a] warming climate,” said Swain in his Bluesky thread. “So it's not a question of whether climate change played a role — it's only a question of how much.”

Staffing shortages at the National Weather Service are an ongoing concern at offices across the country. The Trump administration also recently cut funding meant to help NWS warning coordination meteorologists travel for meetings and tabletop exercises with local authorities, Fahy said. These meetings, he said, help NWS staff members and emergency managers plan together for extreme events.

“We can't predict where the next severe storm or high-impact weather event will take place,” Fahy said. “Therefore, we have to ask that the administration reconsider their decision to suspend the funding for the warning coordination meteorologists.”

Meanwhile, uncertainties are still swirling around the future of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

President Donald Trump has on multiple occasions vowed to overhaul the agency in ways that may make states responsible for more of the costs associated with extreme weather events. Trump has also declined to respond to 12 requests for federal disaster aid that governors have submitted since mid-May, federal records show.

Trump, however, approved disaster aid Sunday for Kerr County, which will aid in recovery efforts and help county residents pay for emergency lodging, home repairs and supplies. It was the president's first disaster declaration since June 19, when he approved aid for parts of Tennessee that were damaged by tornadoes in April.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said his administration will seek to work with FEMA to assess the overall damage and determine whether additional counties should be eligible for FEMA aid.

When asked by reporters Sunday whether he is still planning to phase out FEMA, Trump deflected.

""Well, FEMA is something we can talk about later, but right now, they're busy working,” he said. “So we'll leave it at that.""

Magma Pulses Are Tearing Africa Apart

Chemical fingerprints from volcanic rock offer hints of what's happening in the mantle below the area where three rift zones meet in East Africa

By Nora Bradford edited by Andrea Thompson

A spot in eastern Africa called the Afar Triangle marks the meeting point of three rift zones—lines where Earth's crust is being rent apart. Researchers haven't been sure exactly what drives this rifting, but a new study in Nature Geoscience suggests it is caused by rhythmic pulses of molten rock from deep below the surface.

Scientists first proposed in the 1970s that a hot upsurge of material from Earth's mantle, known as a plume, was occurring below this spot. Since then researchers have debated whether a single plume, multiple smaller “plumelets” or something else entirely is pushing the plates apart. Emma Watts, a geochemist at Swansea University in Wales, wanted to settle the question, so she and a team of geophysicists, geochemists and computational scientists put their heads together and came up with a likely answer.

“The more I look into it, the more I see that you've got to have all the pieces of the puzzle to see the big picture,” she says.

The team analyzed 130 rock samples from volcanoes in the Afar region. Chemical signatures from each sample helped the scientists piece together the movement of the molten rock below Earth's surface: The researchers calculated the ratios of concentrations of elements such as lead and cerium, which can indicate whether deep mantle material has surged upward, as well as the ratios of different isotopes that each originated from slightly varying reservoirs within the mantle.

After comparing their data to computational models of various permutations of mantle plumes, the researchers have found that the best explanation for their observations is a single plume that moves upward in pulses. The pulses appear to exert varying pressure that pushes on each rift zone differently, depending on the way the rift moves and the thickness of the crust on either side. The Afar Triangle's fast-spreading Red Sea Rift has pulses that move farther along the rift zone and that are more frequent than those of the slower-spreading Main Ethiopian Rift in the western part of the triangle.

“The rifting rates are really controlling what we're seeing in the plume,” Watts says. “What we think is that [the Red Sea Rift is] spreading out faster..., so it has more space to move, and it's being stretched out easier.”

The relationship between the mantle movement and the geochemical fingerprints is “exciting because it suggests geophysics and geochemistry can be married to infer large-scale geodynamic processes,” says Catherine Rychert, a geophysicist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was not involved in this research.

This is one of the first known examples of a dynamic mantle plume that responds to the tectonic plates above, so more research is needed to confirm the finding, Rychert says. Watts hopes this technique could be used in other rift systems and that more data from this system could give researchers a more precise view of what is happening deep below Earth's surface.

Prime Day is the perfect time to build out your arsenal of black and yellow tools

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

Amazon Prime Day is always a good time to get the best deals on DeWalt tools, and this year's summer event is no exception. The 2025 sale, which runs from July 8 through July 11, will see wide-ranging discounts on black and yellow gear, especially power tools. Based on early sales, we expect you'll find deals on cordless drills, impact drivers, circular saws, reciprocating saws, and jigsaws across the brand's standard and pro-focused “XR” product lines.

You can also find sale prices on larger DeWalt power tools, including table saws and miter saws. Ahead, we break down the best deals from this premium tool brand that we're seeing right now.

There are deals on everything during Prime Day, including most of my favorite tool brands, so if you're specifically looking to buy DeWalt, it helps to narrow the field. Start by going to the DeWalt Amazon store, then click on the “all deals” tab to see what DeWalt products are on sale.

DeWalt has historically been a big Prime Day backer, offering good deals every year. That said, I do generally recommend Prime Day shoppers do an extra check to make sure you're getting the best possible sale price. You can do this using the Amazon price checker app, or a handful of browser plug-ins like CamelCamelCamel or Keepa. These tools allow you to compare prices with other retailers and track price changes, so you'll know whether the tool you're eyeing has an all-time low price tag or is just a little better than average.

Again, DeWalt goes hard on Prime Day. The company routinely puts more tools on sale than any other premium brand. Even before Prime Day proper, we've already found lower prices on circular saws, drills, impact drivers, shop vacs, and reciprocating saws. You'll also find big discounts on its miter saws and table saws.

Not everything is on sale yet, though. For example, I noticed that there are no deals on tool batteries. In fact, most of the best discounts I've found so far are exclusively for “bare” tools without batteries in the box. This may indicate that DeWalt is holding these deals for Prime Day proper, but it could also indicate a slight pull-back on DeWalt's offering, which is something we've seen from many brands this year.

The drill/impact driver two-pack is a Prime Day staple, so of course there's a good option from DeWalt. This dynamic duo is a great option for novice DIYers looking to build up a toolkit, or new homeowners who just need the absolute essentials for the occasional odd job. The DCD771 drill reaches max speeds of up to 1,500 RPM, and the DCF885 driver doles out up to 1,400 inch-pounds of torque. That's ample power for pretty much any summer DIY project you're planning.

If you're like me and hate all the extra effort that goes into manually sanding your carpentry projects, then this deal might help you take this edge off the task. This DeWalt XR cordless sander is nearly half-off, giving you a cheap upgrade that will spare your arm. An overmolded grip makes it comfortable to hold, and its variable speed trigger allows you to adjust the sanding speed from 8,000 to 12,000 OPM. There's even a dust bag to catch some of the sawdust and minimize mess. 

An oscillating multi-tool can handle a variety of tasks you may run into during your next home improvement project, like cutting through drywall, grinding grout, and sanding wood. DeWalt's XR model is one of the best: Designed for pros, it runs at three different speeds, reaching up to 20,000 oscillations per minute (OPM). Its quick-change accessory suite makes it easy to switch between blade types on complex, multi-phase jobs. Plus, it has comfortable rubberized grips that give you plenty of room to grab it with both hands. At its current DIY friendly price, this tool's a steal.

Fall may feel like it's a long way off, but it's never a bad idea to buy your leaf clean-up tools during the off-season, when they're most likely to be on sale. This powerhouse of a cordless blower produces a max air volume of 450 CFM and has max air speeds of 125 MPH. It also has a variable speed trigger you can lock when taking on bigger jobs, saving your hand. And since it weighs less than 6 pounds, carrying it around isn't going to tire you out.

If you're a DeWalt devotee who's been looking for a good opportunity to add a cordless circular saw to your tool arsenal, then now's the time. This bare 6-1/2-inch circular saw can reach max speeds of 5,150 RPM, which is more than enough power for cutting through plywood, 2x4s, and other dimensional lumber. And at just 7 pounds, it's one of the easier circular saws to use.

DIY carpenters and woodworkers will love the discount on this DeWalt jigsaw. It boasts a high blade speed of up to 3,000 strokes per minute (SPM), so you can count on it to cut clean dovetails and circles through wood. The blade can bevel from 0 to 45 degrees for angled cuts, and has four orbital settings to control cut quality. With its large, overmolded ergonomic handle, you can get a tight grip on it as you cut. There's also an adjustable blower so you can keep sawdust out of your line of sight.

If your list of summer projects involves tearing things down to create something new, then this reciprocating saw can help you power through the demo work. With its long, 1-1/8 inch stroke length and max cutting speed of 3,000 SPM, it chews through 2x4s, nails, drywall, metal and plastic with ease. You can load blades in four different positions, making it easier to cut from various angles.

I've been using the same DeWalt miter saw for 20 years now and it's still going strong, so this feels like an obvious recommendation to me. DeWalt's currently offering a great deal on its 12-inch miter, which can cut through a 2x8 or a 6-1/4 inch base molding in a single pass. It also bevels to 48 degrees, with a miter range of 50 degrees to either side. This is a pro-grade tool, and you're getting it at a price no DIYer could reasonably complain about.

This DeWalt portable job site table saw is typically priced for professionals, but this Prime Day discount makes it a viable option for veteran DIYers. It features a 8-1/4-inch blade and produces a whopping 5,800 max RPM, generating the speed and cutting capacity to make tough rip cuts through thicker materials. It also has a 24.5 inches of rip capacity, so you can cut through wider boards. Plus, at 46 pounds it is truly portable–it's light enough for one person to load into a truck, or move in and out of storage.



Every DIY project leaves you with something to clean up, so it's important to have a reliable shop vac. This 20-volt cordless model comes with a HEPA-rated filter and holds 2 gallons of debris. Its 5-foot hose and compact size make it ideal for toting to wherever in the house your project happens to be or for cleaning out the car. It weighs just 8 pounds and has a convenient carrying handle on the lid.

A portable air compressor will help your tires firm and your pool floaties inflated. It features two hoses: A high-pressure hose for inflating tires, and a low-pressure hose for bikes, balls, and other everyday inflatables. With its LED display, it's easy to read air pressure as you're inflating. I also really like that you can plug this tool into the wall, charge it using a 12V DC car accessory cable, or rely on DeWalt's standard 20V battery.

We're gonna have to rewrite biology textbooks.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Back in high school biology, most of us learned about the innards of a cell, or its organelles, from ribosomes to mitochondria to the endoplasmic reticulum, and probably had to identify them on our midterms. Now, an unexpected discovery will probably soon rewrite those textbooks. 

The hemifusome is the new organelle that high school students (much to their chagrin) will have to remember. Biophysicist Seham Ebrahim of the University of Virginia and her team of researchers were observing mammalian cells when they discovered hemifusomes, which previously eluded detection because they are even smaller than mitochondria and can easily blur or be mistaken for background noise. These nano-orbs, which look like they have, noses bear an uncanny resemblance to BB-8 or the profiles of certain Muppets. Pop culture references aside, their function of organizing, cleaning up, and recycling proteins could potentially unlock new treatments for genetic and neurodegenerative diseases. 

Hemifusomes consist of two vesicles, which are membrane sacs filled with liquid and formed by hemifusion, meaning that the smaller of the two is fused to the larger one like a hemisphere, almost as if its other half is missing. This occurs when the outer layers of two membranes merge first while the inner membrane layers stay open until a thin connection between them forms a new vesicle. The attached vesicles are sometimes found on the outside of the organelle and sometimes on the inside, and though where exactly these vesicles originate is still unknown, hemifusomes are thought to facilitate the formation of new vesicles that transport materials throughout the cell. This is probably how they take out cellular trash. 

Ebrahim used cryo-electron tomography, or cryo-ET, to observe and image hemifusomes. The cells, which were kept at cryogenic temperatures, were imaged in two dimensions using an electron microscope. Superfast cameras then took multiple photos of the frozen cells and their organelles. From these photos, single images were created using algorithms, upgrading the 2D images to 3D.

“Our observation of hemifusomes in four different cell lines originating from various species and tissues and frozen as close as possible to their native state suggests that they may be common components of the cell periphery in a wide range of cells and tissues,” she said in a study recently published in Nature Communications. 

Something else the researchers wanted to explore was what kind of relationship hemifusomes had with endosomes, which are vesicles that transport extracellular material into the cell via the process of endocytosis. The cell's plasma membrane will fold inward to surround matter, such as food molecules, in the surrounding fluid. These molecules are then taken in by the cell, whose plasma membrane pinches off to create an endosome that carries them into the cytoplasm. Endosomes can also form through the fusion of vesicles that already exist within the cell. Ebrahim traced the activity of endosomes and hemifusomes, but they did not appear to work together. 

What makes hemifusomes so important is how they collect and recycle junk proteins. Many studies have shown that the buildup of protein plaque in the brain can cause and aggravate neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer's, and more understanding about how these organelles operate could lead to the development of treatments that work with them. 

“Future research should focus on determining whether hemifusomes and compound hemifusomes are present in other cellular regions,” Ebrahim said, “and on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation, stability, and function, as well as their broader implications for cellular physiology and pathology.”

It's practically impossible.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

As if one ancient circular enclosure wasn't enough to evoke intrigue at an archaeological find in Eastern France, three interconnected enclosures raised the bar. 

In what the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (Inrap) is calling an “unprecedented” discovery in Marliens, France, near Dijon, excavations revealed a series of occupations on one site spanning from the Neolithic period to the First Iron Age.

The oldest occupation features a monument with three interlocking enclosures. The center section offers a circular enclosure 36 feet in diameter, the largest in the bunch. To the north a smaller 26-foot-long horseshoe-shaped enclosure connects directly to the main center piece. To the south, a circular design remains open on one side, but still ties to the main circle. The team believes all three structures are linked together in both positioning and dating and that a gravel layer found on the two side enclosures suggests a fence was also present. 

“This type of monument seems unprecedented and currently no comparison has been possible,” the research team says in a statement. A bundle of artifacts—including seven flint arrowheads, two archer's bracers, a flint lighter, and a copper alloy dagger—discovered in the site's ditches correspond to cut flints, suggesting attribution to the Neolithic period, potentially as far back as 10,000 BC to 2,200 BC. Radiocarbon analytics is planned to help determine exact dating. 

The team located an armband with traces of iron oxide tied to pyrite, indicating it could have been used to light fires. These objects often accompany a burial, but the team couldn't make that conclusion just yet in this case. 

“Analyses of the composition of the copper alloy of the dagger should make it possible to establish its origin and provide us with information on commercial exchanges at that time,” the team writes.

In another location on the site, the team dates five circular enclosures—four open and one closed across a 64,000 square foot plain—between 1500 BC and 1300 BC. The remains of burials and a funeral pyre were found in the ditches of the largest enclosure, although the acidity of the soil didn't allow the preservation of unburned bones, so the team was not able to find a complete burial. Dating based on five copper alloy pins, a necklace with 40 amber beads, and rare ceramic shards confirms the timing. 

A First Iron Age occupation is also nearby, about 1,300 feet from the plain, this with urns and burial ornaments. Early Bronze Age wells sit nearby. An analysis of the clay layers at the bottom of the wells may provide information on the natural environment and landscape of the valley during the Bronze Age.

The team believes that with the analytics underway on the objects found at the site, combined with paleo-environmental studies, they will be able to “propose a scenario of the evolution of this territory over the ages.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","From air to stone: The fig trees fighting climate change","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250706225819.htm","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 05:27:08 GMT","

Some species of fig trees store calcium carbonate in their trunks – essentially turning themselves (partially) into stone, new research has found. The team of Kenyan, U.S., Austrian, and Swiss scientists found that the trees could draw carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and store it as calcium carbonate ‘rocks' in the surrounding soil.

The research is being presented this week at the Goldschmidt conference in Prague.

The trees – native to Kenya – are one of the first fruit trees shown to have this ability, known as the oxalate carbonate pathway.

All trees use photosynthesis to turn CO2 into organic carbon, which forms their trunk, branches, roots and leaves; this is why planting trees is seen as a potential means to mitigate CO2 emissions.

Certain trees also use CO2 to create calcium oxalate crystals. When parts of the tree decay, these crystals are converted by specialised bacteria or fungi into calcium carbonate – the same mineral as limestone or chalk. This increases the soil pH around the tree, while also increasing the availability of certain nutrients. The inorganic carbon in calcium carbonate typically has a much longer lifetime in the soil than organic carbon, making it a more effective method of CO2 sequestration.

Dr Mike Rowley, senior lecturer at the University of Zurich (UZH) is presenting the research at the Goldschmidt conference. He said: “We've known about the oxalate carbonate pathway for some time, but its potential for sequestering carbon hasn't been fully considered. If we're planting trees for agroforestry and their ability to store CO2 as organic carbon, while producing food, we could choose trees that provide an additional benefit by sequestering inorganic carbon also, in the form of calcium carbonate.”

The team, from UZH, the Nairobi Technical University of Kenya, Sadhana Forest, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, University of California, Davis, and the University of Neuchatel studied three species of fig tree grown in Samburu County, Kenya. They identified how far from the tree the calcium carbonate was being formed and identified the microbial communities involved in the process. Using synchrotron analysis at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, they found that calcium carbonate was being formed both on the exterior of tree trunks and deeper within the wood.

Dr Rowley explained: “As the calcium carbonate is formed, the soil around the tree becomes more alkaline. The calcium carbonate is formed both on the surface of the tree and within the wood structures, likely as microorganisms decompose crystals on the surface and also, penetrate deeper into the tree. It shows that inorganic carbon is being sequestered more deeply within the wood than we previously realised.”

Of the three types of fig tree studied, the scientists found that Ficus wakefieldii was the most effective at sequestering CO2 as calcium carbonate. They are now planning to assess the tree's suitability for agroforestry by quantifying its water requirements and fruit yields and by doing a more detailed analysis of how much CO2 can be sequestered under different conditions.

Most of the research into the oxalate-carbonate pathway has been in tropical habitats and focused on trees that do not produce food. The first tree to be identified as having an active oxalate-carbonate pathway was the Iroko (Milicia excelsa). It can sequester one ton of calcium carbonate in the soil over its lifetime.

Calcium oxalate is one of the most abundant biominerals and the crystals are produced by many plants. The microorganisms that convert calcium oxalate to calcium carbonate are also widespread.

“It's easier to identify calcium carbonate in drier environments” explained Dr Rowley. “However, even in wetter environments, the carbon can still be sequestered. So far, numerous species of tree have been identified which can form calcium carbonate. But we believe there are many more. This means that the oxalate-carbonate pathway could be a significant, underexplored opportunity to help mitigate CO2 emissions as we plant trees for forestry or fruit.”

The Goldschmidt Conference is the world's foremost geochemistry conference. It is a joint congress of the European Association of Geochemistry and the Geochemical Society (US) and 4000 people are expected to attend. It takes place in Prague, Czech Republic, from July  6-11, 2025.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Breakthrough battery lets physicists reverse entanglement—and rewrite quantum law","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250706230318.htm","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 12:04:58 GMT","

Just over 200 years after French engineer and physicist Sadi Carnot formulated the second law of thermodynamics, an international team of researchers has unveiled an analogous law for the quantum world. This second law of entanglement manipulation proves that, just like heat or energy in an idealized thermodynamics regime, entanglement can be reversibly manipulated, a statement which until now had been heavily contested. The new research - released on July 2, 2025 in Physical Review Letters - deepens understanding of entanglement's basic properties and provides critical fundamental insight into how to efficiently manipulate entanglement and other quantum phenomena in practice.

Entanglement is arguably the central feature of quantum mechanics. If two microscopic particles are said to be entangled, then if someone measures a quantum property of one of the particles and then repeats the measurement on its entangled partner, they will always find that the pair is correlated, even when the two particles are separated by vast distances. Therefore, knowing the state of one particle automatically provides information about the other. Entanglement was introduced about 90 years ago as proof of the absurdity of quantum theory if treated as a complete description of nature. Yet it is not regarded as absurd today. After exhaustive proofs of entanglement's authenticity in the real world, it is now the key resource in quantum information theory, allowing quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography, and offering significant advantages in quantum computing, communication and precision measurements.

Though entanglement still appears counterintuitive to our lived experience of the world, researchers have discovered striking parallels with something much more familiar: thermodynamics. In fact, many similarities have emerged between the theories of quantum entanglement and thermodynamics. For example, 'entanglement entropy' is a characteristic of idealised, noiseless quantum systems that mimics the role of thermodynamical entropy.

However, an equivalent to the second law of thermodynamics - which dictates that processes tend towards increasing disorder (the aforementioned entropy) and that perfect reversibility is an attainable though rare and highly efficient ideal - has remained stubbornly out of reach. Here, reversibility does not refer to time symmetry but the ability of an external agent to manipulate the system into a different state and then manipulate it back to its initial state without any loss. ""Finding a second law analogous to the second law of thermodynamics has been an open problem in quantum information science,"" says study co-author Tulja Varun Kondra. ""Solving this has been our primary motivation.""

Much work towards addressing this problem has focused on a scenario in which two distant parties (often called Alice and Bob) want to exchange quantum information, but are restricted to act locally on their quantum systems and communicate classically, by say phone or the internet. This limitation to local operations and classical communication (LOCC) simplifies the situation, meaning whatever Alice and Bob do, they cannot affect the intrinsically nonlocal properties of entanglement between their quantum systems.

""It is known that under LOCC operations in this scenario, entanglement is irreversible,"" explains lead author of the study Alexander Streltsov. ""So the question is, can we somehow go beyond LOCC in a meaningful way, and recover reversibility?"" The team's answer is 'yes', as long as Alice and Bob share an additional entangled system: an entanglement battery.

Just as an ordinary battery stores energy which can be used to inject or store work in the context of thermodynamics, an entanglement battery injects and stores entanglement. The battery can be used in the state transformation process and the state of the battery itself can be changed to perform operations. There is only one rule: whatever Alice and Bob do, they must not decrease the level of entanglement within the battery.

And just as a regular battery allows tasks to be performed that would be impossible without one, so too does an entanglement battery. By assisting standard LOCC operations with their hypothetical entanglement battery, the team demonstrated that any mixed-state entanglement transformation can be made perfectly reversible.

This achievement is a significant contribution to the debate around whether entanglement manipulation is generally reversible. But a more important outcome of this work is that the researchers have shown that the methods they have developed are applicable beyond mixed-state entanglement transformation, allowing them to leverage the entanglement battery to verify reversibility in various scenarios. Proving that entanglement manipulations across all quantum states are reversible is expected to lead to a family of second laws for entanglement manipulation.

The entanglement battery may even find uses outside entanglement theory. For example, the same principles apply to systems involving more than two entangled particles, paving the way for understanding and manipulating complex quantum networks and perhaps developing future, highly efficient quantum technologies.

In addition, generalising the concept of an entanglement battery to a resource battery - an additional quantum system that participates in the transformation process without reducing the resource in question - could allow the systematic demonstration of reversibility across quantum physics based on a minimal set of assumptions. ""We can have a battery that is supposed to preserve coherence or free energy, and then we can formulate a reversible framework in this setting where, instead of entanglement, we reversibly manipulate that particular resource of our system,"" says Streltsov. ""Though many of these other principles of reversibility have already been confirmed via other approaches, our technique offers a unified proof framework based on well-established physical principles.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Antarctica's slow collapse caught on camera—and it's accelerating","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250706230305.htm","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 06:45:28 GMT","

Researchers from the University of Copenhagen have gained unique insight into the mechanisms behind the collapse of Antarctic ice shelves, which are crucial for sea level rise in the Northern Hemisphere. The discovery of old aerial photos has provided an unparalleled dataset that can improve predictions of sea level rise and how we should prioritise coastal protection and other forms of climate adaptation.

On November 28, 1966, an American aeroplane flies over the Antarctic Peninsula just south of the southernmost tip of Chile.

On board is a photographer, probably from the US Navy, whose job is to map the Antarctic landscape. But it turns out that the photographer is also documenting a very special situation that is in progress. He shoots an aerial photo of the Wordie Ice Shelf, which, 30 years later, has almost vanished after a total collapse.

The consequence of this collapse was that the 'plug' that held large amounts of glacier ice broke off, leaving the ice sheet floating freely into the sea.

Fortunately, Wordie is a relatively small ice shelf and the sea level rise it has caused can be measured in millimeters. But there are much larger ice shelves in Antarctica, which, like Wordie, could collapse due to climate change. Just the two largest ice shelves, Ronne and Ross, are believed to hold enough ice to account for sea level rises of up to five meters.

If, in this context, we think that Antarctica is far away, we need to understand that the melting of ice in the Southern Hemisphere will cause sea levels to rise in places like Denmark in the Northern Hemisphere, due to the effects of gravity. A new research study provides insights that can help identify signs of incipient collapse in these ice shelves and assess the stage of collapse.

The photo of Wordie from 28 November 1966 -- the first in a long series of images that continually document the collapse of the Wordie Ice Shelf through the 1960s -- has become a valuable first data point in a study of the ice shelf collapse recently completed by researchers at the University of Copenhagen.

In their paper, now published in Nature Communications, they present a unique dataset based on the vast archives of old aerial images combined with modern satellite observations, which, for the first time, shows the collapse of an ice shelf as a constant evolution in a long time series. A critical insight that can be used to improve scientists' understanding of ice shelves and the mechanisms behind their collapse.

""We have identified several signs of incipient ice shelf collapse that we expect will be observed in other ice shelves, but perhaps more importantly, the dataset has given us a multitude of pinning points that can reveal how far advanced a collapse is. It's a completely new tool that we can use to do reality checks on ice shelves that are at risk of collapsing or already in the process of collapsing,"" says Postdoc Mads Dømgaard from the Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management, who is lead author of the study.

According to the researchers, this knowledge will enhance computer models of sea level rise and lead to more accurate predictions of when the water will rise, allowing for prioritization of investments in climate change adaptation in the most effective way.

 Warmer seawater and melting under the ice were most conclusive 

The hundreds of historical aerial photos were analyzed using a technique known as structure-from-motion photogrammetry. The method has enabled scientists to accurately reconstruct ice thickness, as well as its extent, surface structure and flow velocity, dating back to the 1960s.

In this way, the researchers analyzed the collapse of Wordie and learned more about the factors involved. It was previously assumed that a warmer atmosphere was the primary factor leading to the collapse, and, similarly, that the formation of meltwater lakes on the ice surface had also played a part. The new study has disproved both assumptions.

Instead, the researchers highlight melting under the ice where the sea and ice meet as definitive factors.

""Our findings show that the primary driver of Wordie's collapse is rising sea temperatures, which have generated the melting beneath the floating ice shelf,"" Mads Dømgaard says.

 Collapse is tougher than we thought - like it or not 

Furthermore, the study's findings have already altered the foundation of scientists' knowledge about ice shelf collapse. According to co-author Anders Anker Bjørk, the new data advances our understanding of how and at what speed these collapses occur.

""The tentative conclusion from our findings is that ice shelf collapse may be slower than we thought. This means that the risk of a very rapid development of violent sea level rise from melting in Antarctica is slightly lower, based on knowledge from studies like this one,"" says Anders Anker Bjørk, Assistant Professor at the Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management.

But there is also a flip side to this, he explains:

""It was already a supertanker that needed to be turned to stall the melting of ice in Antarctica, but our data shows a collapse process that is even more protracted than previously assumed. And this longer process will make it harder to reverse the trend once it has started. This is an unambiguous signal to prioritize halting greenhouse gas emissions now rather than sometime in the future,"" Anders Anker Bjørk says.

Facts: ice shelves and sea level rise

Ice shelves, like Wordie, act as a kind of brake on glaciers flowing from the ice sheet towards the sea. When an ice shelf vanishes, the glaciers lose this support and can begin to float and melt more rapidly.

As the ice mass of ice shelves is already partially or wholly in the sea, their direct contribution to sea level rise is limited. On the other hand, the glacier ice they retain is on land and, therefore, every cubic meter affects the water level of the world's oceans.

Although Antarctica is far away, areas like Denmark are being affected significantly by sea level rise caused by ice shelf collapses resulting from gravitational forces. Before Antarctica melts, its ice mass helps pull sea waters southwards. When the ice has melted into the sea, the gravitational field has changed, causing the oceans to the north to rise proportionally more.

Facts: How dusty old photos became important data

In the study, the researchers used images from multiple overflights of Wordie, shot between 1966 and 1969.

In analyzing the historical aerial photos, the researchers employed the structure-from-motion photogrammetry method, which utilizes overlapping photos to calculate accurate three-dimensional models of landscapes or objects.

By analyzing differences in perspective between the photos, it's possible to measure heights and distances with high accuracy. This allows tracing how the ice surface, thickness and velocity have changed over time.

When a drummer plays a drum, she sets the drumhead into vibration by hitting it. The vibration contains a signal that we can decode as music. When the drumhead stops vibrating, the signal is lost.

Now imagine a drumhead that is ultra-thin, about 10 mm wide, and perforated with many triangular holes.

Researchers at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, in collaboration with the University of Konstanz and ETH Zurich, have managed to get vibrations to travel around this membrane, almost without any loss. In fact, so little loss that it is far better than even electronic circuit signal handling. The result is now published in the journal Nature.

Phonons - Sound Signals or Vibrations That Spread Through a Solid Material

The signal consists of phonons - which can be translated to what one might call vibrations in a solid material. The atoms vibrate and push each other, so to speak, so a given signal can move through the material. It is not far-fetched to imagine encoding a signal, which is then sent through the material, and here signal loss comes into play.

If the signal loses strength or parts of the signal are lost in heat or incorrect vibrations, one ends up not being able to decode it correctly.

System Reliability is Crucial

The signals that researchers have succeeded in sending through the membrane are distinguished by being almost lossless. The membrane as a platform for sending information is incredibly reliable.

Loss is measured as a decrease in the amplitude of the sound wave as it moves around the membrane. When researchers direct the signal through the material and around the holes in the membrane - where the signal even changes direction - the loss is about one phonon out of a million.

The amplitude of current fluctuations in a similar electronic circuit decreases about a hundred thousand times faster.

Basic Research with Perspectives

Researchers at the Niels Bohr Institute, Assistant Professor Xiang Xi and Professor Albert Schliesser, explain that the result should not be thought of in a specific, future application - but there are still rich possibilities. Currently, there is a global effort to build a quantum computer, which is dependent on super-precise transfer of signals between its different parts.

Another field within quantum research deals with sensors that, for example, can measure the smallest biological fluctuations in our own body - here too, signal transfer is crucial.

But Xiang Xi and Albert Schliesser are currently most interested in exploring the possibilities even further.

""Right now, we want to experiment with the method to see what we can do with it. For example, we want to build more complex structures and see how we can get phonons to move around them, or build structures where we get phonons to collide like cars at an intersection. This will give us a better understanding of what is ultimately possible and what new applications there are,"" says Albert Schliesser. As they say: ""Basic research is about producing new knowledge.""

Key Takeaways:

In experiments with healthy volunteers undergoing functional MRI imaging, scientists have found increased activity in two areas of the brain that work together to react to, and possibly regulate, the brain when it's ""feeling"" tired and either quits or continues exerting mental effort.

The experiments, designed to help detect various aspects of brain fatigue, may provide a way for physicians to better evaluate and treat people who experience overwhelming mental exhaustion, including those with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the scientists say.

A report on the NIH-funded study was published online June 11 in the Journal of Neuroscience, detailing results on 18 female and 10 male healthy adult volunteers given tasks to exercise their memory.

""Our lab focuses on how [our minds] generate value for effort,"" says Vikram Chib, Ph.D., associate professor of biomedical engineering at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and a research scientist at Kennedy Krieger Institute. ""We understand less about the biology of cognitive tasks, including memory and recall, than we do about physical tasks, even though both involve a lot of effort."" Anecdotally, Chib says, scientists know cognitive tasks are tiring, and relatively less about why and how such fatigue develops and plays out in the brain.

The 28 study participants, who ranged in age from 21 to 29, were paid $50 to participate in the study, and were told they could receive additional payments based on their performance and choices. All participants received a baseline MRI scan before the experiments began.

The tests of their working memory, which took place while undergoing subsequent MRI scans of their brains, included looking at a series of letters, in sequence, on a screen and recalling the position of certain letters. The farther back a letter was in the series of letters, the harder it was to recall its position, increasing the cognitive effort expended. The participants were given feedback on their performance after each test and opportunities to receive increasing payments ($1-$8) with more difficult recall exercises. The participants also were asked before and after each test to self-rate their level of cognitive fatigue.

Overall, the test results found increased activity and connectivity in two brain areas when participants reported cognitive fatigue: the right insula, an area deep in the brain that has been associated with feelings of fatigue, and the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, areas on both sides of the brain that control working memory. For each participant, activity in both brain locations during cognitive fatigue increased by more than twice the level of baseline measurements taken before starting the tests.

""Our study was designed to induce cognitive fatigue and see how people's choices to exert effort change when they feel fatigue, as well as identify locations in the brain where these decisions are made,"" says Chib.

Notably, Chib and his research team members Grace Steward and Vivian Looi found that the financial incentives need to be high in order for participants to exert increased cognitive effort, suggesting that external incentives prompt such effort.

""That outcome wasn't entirely surprising, given our previous work finding the same need for incentives in spurring physical effort,"" says Chib.

""The two areas of the brain may be working together to decide to avoid more cognitive effort unless there are more incentives offered. However, there may be a discrepancy between perceptions in cognitive fatigue and what the human brain is actually capable of doing,"" says Chib.

Fatigue is linked with many neurological conditions, including PTSD and depression, says Chib. ""Now that we've likely identified some of the neural circuits for cognitive effort in healthy people, we need to look at how fatigue manifests in the brains of people with these conditions,"" he adds.

Chib says it may be possible to use medication or cognitive behavior therapy to combat cognitive fatigue, and the current study using decision tasks and functional MRI could be a framework for objectively classifying cognitive fatigue.

Functional MRI uses blood flow to measure broad areas of activity in the brain; however, it does not directly measure neuron activation, nor more subtle nuances in brain activity.

""This study was performed in an MRI scanner and with very specific cognitive tasks. It will be important to see how these results generalize to other cognitive effort and real-world tasks,"" says Chib.

Funding for the research was provided by the National Institutes of Health (R01HD097619, R01MH119086).

The immune-system agents called natural killer cells (artificially coloured) can be bioengineered to attack cells that produce dangerous antibodies.Credit: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/National Institutes of Health/Science Photo Library

Supercharged ‘natural killer' cells could become a potent way to reset a disordered immune system — and thus quench some autoimmune disorders. 

Results from two small clinical trials suggest that researchers can engineer natural killer cells — immune cells that destroy infected or diseased cells — to assassinate the renegade cells that produce antibodies against the body's own tissues. These ‘autoantibodies' can damage tissues, fuelling autoimmune diseases such as lupus and systemic sclerosis. 

“Natural killer cells have evolved to seek and destroy abnormal cells,” says Nadir Mahmood, president of Nkarta, a biotechnology company in South San Francisco, California. “And if that's deep enough to drive an immune-system reset, then you can have the reconstitution of a healthy and naive immune system.”

Findings from one trial were announced in June at the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) meeting in Barcelona, Spain. Results from the other trial were published in the journal Cell1. 

This approach has its roots in cancer therapies that rely on another kind of immune cell, called T cells, that can be genetically engineered to recognize and kill tumours. The engineered cells use a protein called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to identify their targets, and are therefore called CAR T cells.

CAR T cells can send some forms of blood cancer into remissions lasting more than a decade, and they have shown early promise against certain autoimmune disorders. But CAR-T-cell therapies on the market now are expensive and complicated to make: each treatment must be manufactured from the recipient's own T cells.

‘It's all gone': CAR-T therapy forces autoimmune diseases into remission

These factors mean that, at present, only about one-quarter of people in the United States who might benefit from CAR-T-cell cancer therapies can access them, says Katy Rezvani, who studies cell therapy at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. “There are five times as many patients with autoimmunity as there are with cancer,” she says. “So how are we ever going to be able to afford these expensive therapies for autoimmune disorders?”

Natural killer cells, however, can be taken from a blood donor and genetically modified to produce ‘CAR NK' cells, which can be frozen and used to treat multiple people. Rezvani says that her colleagues at MD Anderson can make hundreds of doses of CAR NK cells from a single donation of umbilical-cord blood.

The first trials of CAR NK cells have been in cancer and have had mixed early results, says Mahmood. One possible limitation is that these cells are shorter-lived than are CAR T cells, says Max Qian, chief executive of Rui Therapeutics, a company in Nanjing, China, that is developing CAR-NK-cell therapies. “If the tumour comes back, you need the drug to still be in the body,” he says.

But the cells' fleeting presence might not be a problem for treating autoimmune diseases. A brief treatment with CAR NK cells could be enough to wipe out autoantibody production, Qian adds, or a person could receive several doses of the treatment if needed. After that, the immune system could rebuild itself with a fresh population of antibody-producing cells that have not been triggered to make autoantibodies.

Can autoimmune diseases be cured? Scientists see hope at last

Can autoimmune diseases be cured? Scientists see hope at last

Late last year, Nkarta announced that it would end its efforts to make CAR-NK-cell cancer therapies and would instead focus on autoimmune disorders. “It seemed like CAR-NK-cell therapy was tailor-made for autoimmune disease,” says Mahmood.

The most established reactivity of [1.1.1]propellane involves addition reactions at the bridge C-C bond, resulting in the formation of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane derivatives. Herein, we present a [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement that uses [1.1.1]propellane as a carbene precursor to rapidly access allenylated or allylated methylenecyclobutanes. The reaction is highly efficient and scalable, works well under mild conditions, and can tolerate a diverse range of functional groups on propargyl and allyl sulfides/selenides. Another significant achievement of this approach is the utility of the obtained products in synthesizing substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes, potential bioisosteres of ortho and meta-substituted benzenes, by developing a photocatalyzed radical cascade cyclization. Density functional theory calculations suggest the involvement of a copper-bound five-membered transition state.

Carbene transfer reactions are highly effective in organic synthesis, creating molecular complexity selectively through X-H insertions, additions, or rearrangement reactions1,2,3,4,5. The most common way of generating carbenes is from highly reactive diazoalkanes using metal catalysts or photoirradiation (Fig. 1A)3,4,5,6,7,8. The other alternative precursors for carbenes include substituted triazoles or alkynes with pyridine N-oxides using transition metal catalysts9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. Generating carbenes via the activation of C−C bonds is highly beneficial as it provides unique opportunities for constructing backbones of organic molecules. Nonetheless, the high ring strain of [1.1.1]propellane could provide the necessary driving force to activate inert C−C bonds under metal catalysis, enabling the formation of a metal-carbene species that can be further functionalized to access valuable scaffolds. Cyclopropanes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes are known to generate carbenes under metal catalysis by double C–C bond activation, but they are limited to only a few examples17,18,19,20,21,22,23. Consequently, systems that could facilitate the challenging double C−C bond activation to generate metal-carbenes at ambient conditions for increasing molecular diversity in synthetic organic chemistry are highly desirable.

A Known carbenes; B Reactivity of [1.1.1]propellane; C Reaction design; D Importance of methylenecyclobutanes; E Our work: [2,3]-Sigmatropic rearrangement with [1.1.1]propellane and its applications.

[1.1.1]Propellane is the smallest member of the propellane family, with a strain energy of ~100 kcal/mol. It exhibits unique reactivity due to the presence of an “inverted” central C–C σ-bond connecting the bridgehead carbons24,25,26. The reactivity of [1.1.1]propellane is predominantly focused on the difunctionalization of the bridgehead bond via either radical or ionic pathways owing to its omniphilic reactivity, leading to the formation of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane derivatives (Fig. 1B)27,28,29,30. Despite the surge in a growing number of examples of 1,3-difunctionalizations of [1.1.1]propellane, its carbene reactivity is less explored31,32,33,34,35. However, its inherent ring strain should furnish the required driving force for enabling the challenging double C−C bond activation to generate a metal carbene species via retro-cyclopropanation. To date, only a few synthetic examples have been reported that employ the carbene reactivity of [1.1.1]propellane, including cyclopropanation32, alkyne insertion33, and a three-component cyclobutylation34.

The Doyle–Kirmse reaction, a [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of onium ylides rendered by reacting a metal carbene with allyl or propargyl compounds, is among the powerful methods for the concomitant formation of C–C and C-X bonds36,37,38,39. This reaction has found a plethora of applications in the preparation of complex natural products and pharmaceuticals40,41,42,43,44,45,46. Due to the broad applicability of the Doyle–Kirmse reaction, developing carbene precursors for this rearrangement, particularly with versatile functionalities, could significantly expand the potential chemical space. We envisioned that the carbenes generated by C–C bond activation of [1.1.1]propellane under metal catalysis could be exploited in the Doyle–Kirmse reaction (Fig. 1C). However, a major concern with this strategy is the formation of unwanted dimerization and polymerization products from the highly reactive metal-carbene species31. This proposal not only presents a unique reactivity between methylenecyclobutyl carbenes and allyl or propargyl sulfides/selenides but also offers a mechanistically distinct method to access valuable functionalized methylenecyclobutanes (MCBs). In addition to their presence in several naturally occurring and biologically active compounds47, MCBs are versatile reactive intermediates due to the presence of both the exo-methylene unit and reactive four-membered ring and thus participate in a variety of cycloadditions, difunctionalizations, ring-expansions leading to highly valuable building blocks (Fig. 1D)48,49,50. Herein, we report our success in the development of the [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement with MCB carbenes under copper catalysis (Fig. 1E). A wide range of propargyl and allyl -sulfides and -selenides are well tolerated. The reaction exhibits broad scope and excellent functional group tolerance. Noteworthy, the obtained products were efficiently transformed into trisubstituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes through a photocatalyzed radical cascade cyclization. Additionally, the exo-methylene, the allyl or allenyl groups, and the sulfide moieties of the products can serve as versatile synthetic handles for further transformations. Density functional theory calculations provide insight into the reaction mechanism and suggest a Cu(I)-bound five-membered envelope transition state to give the product.

We initiated our investigations by exploring the [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement between [1.1.1]propellane 2 and phenyl propargyl sulfide 1a using Rh2(OAc)4, a catalyst that Wiberg and coworkers used for the generation of MCB Rh-carbene31. However, only a trace amount of product 3a was observed, along with a significant amount of dimer product 4 (Column 1, Fig. 2). We were not able to isolate the dimerization product 4 due to high volatility. However, we confirmed the formation of 4 by crude 1H NMR technique (see Supplementary Information page S126). Next, we screened various metal catalysts to obviate the undesired dimerization and oligomerization of 2 (Columns 2–9, Fig. 2). Among the catalysts tested, Cu(acac)2 was the best catalyst, affording the desired product in 63% yield (Column 9, Fig. 2). The solvent screening revealed that toluene is the most effective, yielding the product in 73% (Columns 10–13, Fig. 2). Increasing the reaction concentration led to an improvement in the yield (Columns 14–15, Fig. 2). Further optimization identified the use of 1.5 equiv of 2 as optimal, giving the desired product in 93% yield (Column 16, Fig. 2). Pleasingly, the synthesis of 3a was performed on a 4 mmol scale with similar efficiency, thus highlighting the scalability of the reaction. No product formation occurred in the absence of Cu(acac)2, indicating that the copper catalyst is essential for the reaction (Column 17, Fig. 2).

Reaction conditions: 0.15 mmol of 1a, 0.15 mmol of 2, catalysts (5 mol%), anhydrous solvent (1.5 mL), room temperature, 12 h. All catalysts were screened with anhydrous DCM solvent. Conversions and NMR yields were calculated using 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene as an internal standard. Blue colored bar representing the conversions of 1a, and gray colored bar representing the yield of product 3a.

With the optimized conditions established, we investigated the scope of propargyl sulfides that could be employed (Fig. 3). A wide range of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents at the para position of arene rings reacted smoothly, providing the desired allenylated MCBs 3b–3g in good to excellent yields. Notably, unprotected phenol (product 3d) was well tolerated, whereas such a sensitive functional group is incompatible with previously reported carbene transfer reactions51. ortho- and meta-Substituted arenes were also engaged in the reaction (products 3h, 3i, and 3j). Disubstituted-phenyl, naphthyl, and thiophenyl-derived propargyl sulfides underwent the desired transformation successfully, affording the corresponding products 3k–3m in good yields. The reaction is not limited to aryl propargyl sulfides; benzyl and a broad range of alkyl propargyl sulfides, including adamantyl, tert-butyl, and long alkyl chains, were well tolerated (3n–3q). The α-ester-substituted propargyl sulfide was also found to be a suitable substrate (product 3r). Interestingly, diol-containing bis-propargyl sulfide participated well, providing both mono- and di-allenylated MCBs 3s and 3t in 59% and 33% yields, respectively. Next, we explored various substitutions on internal alkynes. Methyl, phenyl, and trimethylsilyl groups were well tolerated, affording geminal disubstituted allenes bearing MCBs (products 3u–3w). Pleasingly, substrates containing various substituents on propargylic position displayed excellent reactivity to provide chiral disubstituted allenes 3x–3z. Finally, to expand the chemical space of this transformation, we tested bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) bearing propargyl sulfides. To our delight, we obtained the corresponding BCP pendant MCBs 3aa and 3ab in good yields. The structure of product 3aa was determined through X-ray crystallographic analysis (CCDC 2379384). As organoselenium compounds are prevalent in pharmaceuticals and are versatile reactive intermediates in organic synthesis, we were eager to explore whether phenyl propargyl selenides could be used in our reaction, thus expanding our product portfolio also to include selenium-bearing MCBs as well. Indeed, we found that under slightly modified conditions, phenyl propargyl selenide furnished the desired MCB 3ac in 51% yield. Electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents on ortho and para positions were tolerated well (products 3ad–3ah).

Reaction conditions: 0.30 mmol of 1, 1.5 equiv of 2, 5.0 mol% of Cu(acac)2, 0.80 mL of anhydrous toluene, room temperature, 12 h. Yields are of isolated products. aReactions were performed on a 0.15 mmol scale.

Given the versatility of the Doyle–Kirmse reaction for introducing various functionalities into carbene, we proceeded to investigate whether our reaction could be extended beyond propargyl sulfides. We were delighted to find that the treatment of phenyl allyl sulfide 5a with 2 under standard conditions gave the desired allylated MCB 6a in excellent yield, though with some difficulties in isolating the product from unreacted sulfide 5 (Fig. 4). However, we successfully overcome it by using a slight excess of 2. To demonstrate the robust nature of the protocol, we performed the reaction on a 2 mmol scale, and the desired product 6a was obtained with a 95% yield. Next, we turned our attention to the scope of allyl phenyl sulfides. Functional groups such as ethers, bromo, and chloro on aromatic rings participated well, providing the corresponding products 6b–6f with excellent yields. It is worth mentioning that the reaction shows very high chemoselectivity towards allyl sulfide (product 6c) in the presence of allyl ether. Napthyl and thiophene-substituted allyl sulfides were also viable substrates in this reaction (products 6g and 6h). Several aliphatic allyl sulfides with functional groups, including cyano, keto, fluorinated alkyl chain, and olefins, were tested and well-reacted to give the products 6i–6n in excellent yields. Gratifyingly, BCP-derived allyl sulfide gave the desired BCP-bearing MCBs 6o and 6p in 73% and 67% yields, respectively. Lastly, we demonstrated that allyl selenides were also effective partners, with the MCB selenides 6q–6u formed in good to excellent yields.

Reaction Conditions: 0.15 mmol of 4, 2.0 equiv of 2, 5.0 mol% of Cu(acac)2, 0.40 mL of anhydrous toluene, room temperature, 12 h. Yields are of isolated products. a0.40 mL of anhydrous DCM was used instead of toluene.

Aromatic rings are prevalent in various bioactive compounds, from naturally occurring substances to synthetic drugs. However, the propensity of π-electron-rich aromatic rings toward oxidation can lower their metabolic stability52. In this context, strategies that aim to modify lead compounds could enhance metabolic stability, thus reducing the drug dosage regimen. One of the strategies to increase metabolic stability is to increase the sp3-carbon content of potential drug candidates53. The rigid structure of 3D-saturated hydrocarbons provides a precise spatial orientation of substituents, mimicking the topological arrangement of aromatic rings and increasing metabolic stability. A range of C(sp³)-rich hydrocarbon bioisosteres has since been developed for para-substituted benzenes27,28,53. In contrast, saturated sp3-hybridized bioisosteres of ortho- and meta-substituted benzenes are less investigated54,55. Recently, bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs) have attracted significant attention as bioisosteres of ortho- and meta-substituted benzenes, depending on the substitution pattern (Fig. 5A)56,57,58. The most common methods for synthesizing BCHs are through an intramolecular [2 + 2] cycloaddition of 1,5-dienes or [2π + 2σ] cycloaddition of BCBs (Fig. 5B)56,57,58,59,60,61,62. In order to effectively tailor the properties of BCHs, strategies that would install diverse functional groups on BCHs are highly desirable.

A Importance of bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs). B Previous methods on BCH synthesis. C Our strategy: Radical cascade cyclization and scope study. Reaction conditions: 0.10 mmol of 6, 0.15 mmol of 7, 1.0 mol% of fac-Ir(ppy)3 catalyst, 0.20 mmol of LiBr, anhydrous DMF (0.50 mL), 457 nm in Photocube, room temperature, 3 h. a12 h instead of 3 h. Yields are of isolated compounds.

To demonstrate the synthetic utility of our methodology, we envisioned employing the alkylated MCBs as useful precursors for the synthesis of highly functionalized BCHs. We anticipated that radicals generated via single electron reduction of bifunctional reagent 7 under photoredox catalysis could add to a more reactive exo-methylene group in 6 followed by 5-exo-trig cyclization onto the olefin and subsequent group transfer would give tri-substituted BCHs 8 (Fig. 5C). To our delight, the treatment of allylated MCB 6a with ethyl 2-bromo-2,2-difluoroacetate (7a) using 4CzIPN as a photocatalyst in acetonitrile under blue light irradiation gave the desired product 8a in 42% yield. After thoroughly investigating various photocatalysts, solvents, and additives, we found that the yield could be improved to 88% by using Ir(ppy)3 as a catalyst and LiBr as an additive in DMF solvent (see Supplementary Information for the complete optimization studies). This protocol is compatible with various α-bromo mono and di-esters, providing the desired BCHs with moderate to good yields (products 8b–8d). Tetrabromomethane is also a viable substrate under these conditions (product 8e). Next, we explored the scope of allylated MCBs using 7a. We were pleased to find that bromo, chloro, and allyl ether on the arene ring of the allylated MCBs were well tolerated (products 8f–8h). Furthermore, cyano and benzyl groups were also compatible under the reaction conditions, giving products 8i and 8j in 78% and 58%, respectively. BCP and adamantyl substituted MCBs successfully underwent the desired radical cascade to give high C(sp³)-rich hydrocarbon motifs 8k and 8l. To our surprise, treating compound 6l under our standard reaction conditions resulted in the formation of free thiol substituted BCH 8m via retro-Michael addition (see Supplementary Information for more details) that could be utilized as a synthetic handle for further installing diverse functionalities. The allylated MCB selenide 6r also participated in this reaction, affording product 8n in 52% yield. The functional groups introduced during the radical cascade could be further utilized to access a highly complex fused BCH 8ca in 75% yield. To the best of our knowledge, this type of fused-BCH has not yet been reported in the literature. Finally, BCH-sulfone 8cb could also be accessed by treating 8c with m-CPBA.

We further demonstrated the synthetic utility of the obtained products by efficiently transforming them into valuable building blocks (Fig. 6). We obtained the spiro-fused product 9 upon photoirradiation of allenylated MCB 3a with chromone using thioxanthone as a photosensitizer. Selective difluorocyclopropanation with TMSCF3 provided difluorocyclopropyl-spirocyclobutane 10 in good yield. Spiro-epoxy sulfone 11 was obtained when treating 3a with an excess of m-CPBA, whereas reducing the amount of m-CPBA gave the sulfone 12 selectively. Sulfoximine-MCB 13 could be synthesized by reacting 3a with phenyliodine(III) diacetate (PIDA) and ammonium carbonate. Notably, 3a underwent the second Doyle–Kirmse reaction with [1.1.1]propellane 2 to give highly substituted conjugated diene 14 in 65% yield. Next, we explored the synthetic utility of allylated MCBs. A [2 + 2] cycloaddition between 6a and maleimide derivative under energy transfer photocatalysis gave the desired spiro-fused product 15 in 63% yield. Spiro[2.3]hexane 16 and oxaspiro[2.3]hexane 17 were accessed by treating 6a with TMSCF3 and m-CPBA, respectively. Selective bromination of exo-methylene bond in 6a was possible to afford the product 18. Alkylidenecyclobutane 19 could be obtained through a metathesis reaction between MCB 6a and benzyl acrylate. Finally, ozonolysis of 6a yielded cyclobutanone 20 bearing aldehyde and sulfone substituents, which can serve as useful synthetic handles for further elaboration.

Reaction conditions: All reactions were performed on a 0.10 mmol scale. Yields are of isolated products. The diastereomeric ratio (dr) was determined from the 1H & 19F-NMR of the crude reaction mixture.

Our investigation into the reaction mechanism was centered on probing whether the reaction follows a metal-bound or free-ylide pathway. To determine whether the reaction proceeds through a free-ylide or cooper-bound pathway, we reacted allyl phenyl sulfide 5a and [1.1.1]propellane 2 in toluene without catalyst; no product 6a formation was observed. Even at reflux conditions in toluene, the desired product 6a was obtained only in 10% yield, whereas 97% yield was obtained with the copper catalyst at room temperature (Fig. 7A). Moreover, treatment of only [1.1.1]propellane 2 with Cu(acac)2 at room temperature gave dimer 4 (Fig. 7Aa), whereas no dimer was detected without the copper catalyst (Fig. 7Ab), indicating the involvement of copper-carbene species that probably gave the dimer 4. These control experiments suggest that the copper not only activates [1.1.1]propellane 2 to give copper-carbene species but may also participate in the [2,3]-rearrangement process. Next, we conducted DFT calculations to gain a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanism drawn from experimental observations (Fig. 7B). Geometry optimizations and frequency calculations were carried out using B3LYP/Def2TZVP, whereas the single-point energy calculations were performed at the B3LYP/Def2QZVPP using the SMD (toluene) model. The toluene-coordinated Cu(I)(acac) complex (Cucat) was found to be more stable than Cu (I)(acac) by 8.2 kcal/mol. Next, [1.1.1]propellane replaces toluene in Cucat to give Int-163,64,65,66,67, which then undergoes a concerted ring-opening in which two C–C bonds are cleaved, leading to the formation of the copper(I)-carbene Int-2 through a transition state (TS-1) with an activation energy of 1.0 kcal/mol. Subsequent addition of allyl phenyl sulfide 5a to the copper-carbene generates the copper(I)-bound ylide Int-3a with a barrier of 8.0 kcal/mol (TS-2). For the [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, we considered all three pathways, i.e., copper-bound, copper-unbound, and free-ylide68. Our calculations suggested that the copper(I)-bound pathway (TS-3a) is energetically favored over the free-ylide pathway (TS-3c), and it is closely competing with the copper(I)-unbound pathway (TS-3b), where the copper is associated with the phenyl ring (see Supplementary Data 1 for coordinates). The experimental and computational studies support that the reaction proceeds through a copper(I) bound five-membered transition state to furnish the [2,3]-rearrangement product69,70,71,72,73.

A Control experiments: (a) [1.1.1]Propellane with Cu(acac)2, (b) [1.1.1]Propellane without Cu(acac)2. B DFT studies. Geometry optimizations and frequency calculations were carried out using B3LYP/Def2TZVP, whereas the single-point energy calculations were performed at the B3LYP/Def2QZVPP using the SMD (toluene) model. Cu(I) is involved in all TSs and intermediates.

In summary, we have developed the [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement with [1.1.1]propellane by harnessing its carbene reactivity to access densely functionalized allenylated or allylated MCBs. The use of a readily available copper catalyst and mild reaction conditions makes this methodology highly practical. The reaction offers a broad scope across a large pool of propargyl and allyl sulfides and selenides and exhibits excellent functional group tolerance. The synthetic utility of the protocol was demonstrated by transforming the allylated MCBs into substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes through a photocatalyzed radical cascade cyclization. The versatility of the functional groups introduced during the reaction was further highlighted by converting them into valuable building blocks for chemical synthesis. Combined experimental and computational studies suggested the metal-bound mechanism for the rearrangement step. We believe that our strategy will encourage researchers to utilize the carbene reactivity of [1.1.1]propellane to develop valuable transformations in organic synthesis, ultimately unlocking the potential of this largely uncharted research area.

A flame-dried 5 mL Schlenk tube was charged with copper (II) acetylacetonate (4.0 mg, 15 μmol, 0.05 equiv) and propargyl sulfide/selenide 1 (0.3 mmol, 1 equiv). The tube was then evacuated and backfilled with argon three times. Anhydrous toluene (0.8 mL) was added under an argon atmosphere, and the mixture was stirred for 10 min at room temperature. To this reaction mixture, [1.1.1]propellane 2 (1.1 mL, 0.45 mmol, 1.5 equiv, 0.40 M in diethyl ether) was added through a syringe pump for 10 min. After stirring for 12 h, the reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the crude product was purified by column chromatography using a mixture of EtOAc and petroleum ether as mobile phase to afford the desired product.

A flame-dried 5 mL glass vial was charged with fac-tris(2-phenylpyridine)iridium(III) (0.7 mg, 1 μmol, 0.01 equiv), allylmethylenecyclobutyl-sulfane/selane 6 (0.10 mmol, 1.0 equiv), diradical precursor 7 (0.15 mmol, 1.5 equiv), anhydrous LiBr (17 mg, 0.20 mmol, 2.0 equiv), and anhydrous DMF (0.5 mL). Next, the reaction mixture was degassed using the Freeze-Pump-Thaw method and irradiated at 457 nm in Photocube (ThalesNano). After 3 h, the reaction mixture was quenched with H2O (7 mL) and extracted with diethyl ether (3 ×7 mL). The organic layers were combined, concentrated under reduced pressure, and the crude product was purified by column chromatography using a mixture of EtOAc and petroleum ether as mobile phase to afford the desired product.

The 18-electron rule is a fundamental rule in coordination chemistry on which several revolutionary discoveries in catalysis and materials science are founded. This rule has classes of exceptions; however, it is widely taught and accepted that diamagnetic 18-electron complexes do not coordinate to a ligand to form a 20-electron complex even as a reaction intermediate. Here, based on tunable ligand design, we report the formation of 20-electron ferrocene derivatives through reversible nitrogen coordination to 18-electron analogs. Through theoretical studies, we have elucidated key features that enabled this coordination chemistry and how the nitrogen coordination shifts the metal−ligand bonding characters. These 20-electron ferrocene derivatives exhibit reversible FeII/FeIII/FeIV redox chemistry under previously unattainable, mild conditions. This work highlights the previously unknown coordination chemistry of diamagnetic 18-electron complexes, which underlies the foundation for future innovations in a range of synthetic chemistry.

The 18-electron rule, proposed in 1921 by Langmuir1, is a widely taught and used method for predicting the structures and stability of diamagnetic d-block coordination complexes2. Three Nobel prize discoveries in this century3,4,5 and cutting-edge applications, including metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)6, are founded on this rule to a certain extent. This rule is known to have several classes of exceptions, such as the stability of paramagnetic 20-electron nickelocene7, and d8 square planar 16-electron complexes. However, the stability of diamagnetic 18-electron complexes, especially complexes with d6 electron configuration, is the commonly accepted experimental foundation of this rule. Against this backdrop, the coordination of a ligand to a diamagnetic 18-electron complex that results in a formal 20-electron complex is generally considered improbable, even as a reaction intermediate8. One of the most prominent examples of the 18-electron rule is the structure and stability of ferrocene, which marks the beginning of modern organometallic chemistry9. Various derivatives of ferrocene have been synthesized and used in important applications, such as catalysis10, solar cell components11, medicines12, medical devices13, and advanced materials14,15. The versatility of ferrocene derivatives is attributed mainly to their stability, reversible one-electron oxidation under mild potentials, and ease of functionalization16,17. The stability of ferrocene derivatives stems from their coordinatively saturated, formal 18-electron configuration. While reduction or oxidation of ferrocene derivatives to a formal 19-electron anion18,19 or 16-electron dication20,21,22, respectively, requires some of the strongest reductants or oxidants (Fig. 1a), ferrocene derivatives can be oxidized to a formal 17-electron cation at mild oxidation potentials23,24 since the iron center is relatively electron-rich. For the same reason, ferrocene derivatives can coordinate to Lewis acidic species, such as boranes, and cationic or coordinatively unsaturated metal centers25,26,27,28,29 (Fig. 1b). In contrast, the coordination of a Lewis basic ligand to iron atom in ferrocene has remained elusive (Fig. 1c). For example, ferrocene does not react with CO even under 150 atm30. In theory, this coordination would form formal 20-electron ferrocene derivatives if the η5-coordination mode of the two cyclopentadienyl (Cp) groups does not change upon the coordination31. A bonding model based on sdn metal hybridization and 3c–4e hypervalent bonding predicts the possibility of such coordination chemistry of 18-electron complexes32,33. However, such coordination chemistry of diamagnetic 18-electron ferrocene derivatives is considered unlikely according to the 18-electron rule. Here, we report the synthesis of formal 20-electron ferrocene derivatives by reversible intramolecular coordination of a pyridine ligand to the corresponding diamagnetic 18-electron derivatives. Moreover, this coordination chemistry enables unusually facile stepwise oxidation of the ferrocene derivatives from FeII through FeIII to FeIV.

To observe the improbable coordination chemistry of 18-electron ferrocene derivatives, we developed a simple X-CpNCp ligand system (Fig. 2a) that could stabilize the expected 20-electron species. Our previous study showed that the H-CpNCp ligand promotes nitrogen coordination to a derivative of paramagnetic 19-electron cobaltocene, a typical exception to the 18-electron rule34. The addition of the Na2[H-CpNCp] salt to a tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of FeBr2 resulted in the rapid formation of NaBr precipitate and a dark red-brown solution. After workup, a dark orange crystalline solid of the Fe(H-CpNCp) complex, 1-H, was isolated in 54% yield. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) study revealed that the Fe···N distance in 1-H is 3.0403(8) Å, and the nitrogen electron pair is directed away from the iron atom, while the two Cp groups are bound to Fe in the η5-coordination mode (Fig. 2b). Therefore, in the crystalline phase, 1-H is a formal 18-electron complex without an Fe−N bond, reflecting the expected stability of an 18-electron complex. Consistent with this observation, the 57Fe Mössbauer spectrum of the solid sample of 1-H at 77 K (Fig. 3a, c) showed a doublet signal with isomer shift (δ) and quadrupole splitting (ΔEQ) similar to ferrocene35 (Fig. 3c), and solid-state magnetic measurements by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) supported the formation of a diamagnetic complex. However, in solution, extremely broad 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals were observed at 25 °C (Supplementary Fig. 7). Variable-temperature NMR (from −40 °C to 150 °C) and solution magnetic measurements by Evans' method showed the presence of a temperature-dependent equilibrium between diamagnetic and paramagnetic species. Consistent with the solid-state structure, the diamagnetic species observed at −40 °C showed a 15N NMR chemical shift indicating the absence of an Fe−N bonding interaction (Supplementary Fig. S9). Whereas the 1H NMR spectrum of the paramagnetic species recorded at 150 °C supported the C2v molecular symmetry and indicated formation of N-coordination species.

Two separate spectra recorded between 380 ppm to −20 ppm and between 20 ppm to −380 ppm were combined to show the entire region with accurate baseline corrections and integration values (see Supplementary Fig. 25 for an uninterrupted spectrum). s: Residual solvent signals from toluene-d8.

Aiming at isolating Fe–N bonded species, we synthesized the X-CpNCp ligands with varying Lewis basicity (Fig. 2a). The Lewis acid–base interaction between the metal and the pyridine group was previously identified as the key driving force for the coordination of a pyridine group to the cobaltocene derivative34. When most Lewis basic NMe2-CpNCp ligand was reacted with FeBr2, the N-coordinated complex 2-NMe2 was isolated as an off-white solid in 39% yield. Complex 2-NMe2 is air sensitive; however, it is stable under a nitrogen atmosphere at 25 °C for more than a year. VSM measurements confirmed the formation of a high-spin, S = 2 complex with an effective magnetic moment of 4.9 μB (μB: Bohr magneton) at 298 K. The SC-XRD structure of 2-NMe2 (Fig. 2c) revealed a significantly shortened Fe−N distance of 2.1476(10) Å, which is among the shortest FeII–N distances in high-spin, pyridine-based FeIIPNP pincer complexes (Supplementary Table 12). Fe···Cp centroid (Fe···Cpc) distances of 2.0383(6) Å and 2.0393(5) Å are more than 0.33 Å longer than those of 1-H (1.689(4)–1.709(2) Å) and ferrocene (1.651 Å)36, and represent the longest Fe···Cpc distances in FeII ferrocene derivatives37, suggesting a substantial weakening of Fe···C(Cp) interatomic interactions. The coordination mode of the Cp groups was analyzed by the Cp ring slip parameters Δ and ψ (Fig. 2d)38. Δ distances of 0.112 Å and 0.124 Å and Ψ angles of 3.2° and 3.5° for the two Cp groups of 2-NMe2, respectively, fall within the range that supports the η5-coordination mode38,39. In agreement with this analysis, the Δ and Ψ values of η5-coordinated Cp groups in 1-H were 0.074–0.252 Å and 2.5° to 5.9°, respectively. Unlike other ferrocenophane derivatives40, the Cp rings in 2-NMe2 are tilted toward the bridging moiety of the ligand, forming a Cpc···Fe···Cpc angle of 145.92(3)°. This significant inward tilting corroborates the presence of an attractive interaction between the Fe and N atoms. In contrast, the bending of the Cpc···Fe···Cpc angle was much smaller in 1-H (about 170.6°). The 57Fe Mössbauer spectrum of solid 2-NMe2 at 77 K (Fig. 3b, c) shows a doublet signal at δ = 1.15 mm s−1 with a trace doublet signal from N-noncoordinated complex 1-NMe2 at δ = 0.58 mm s−1. Note that δ values more than 1 mm s−1 are characteristic of S = 2, FeII complexes41 and consistent with the spin and oxidation state of 2-NMe2.

In solution, the 1H NMR spectrum recorded at −40 °C showed five broad signals between –330 ppm and +180 ppm, consistent with the formation of paramagnetic 2-NMe2. In addition to these signals, five sharper signals appeared in the typical diamagnetic region (0–10 ppm) of the spectrum (Fig. 3d). Based on two-dimensional (2D) NMR experiments, selective deuteration of Cp protons, and 1H NMR integral ratios, these signals in the paramagnetic and diamagnetic regions were assigned to N-coordinated 2-NMe2 and N-noncoordinated 1-NMe2, respectively. Notably, 1-NMe2 displays a 15N NMR signal of the pyridine nitrogen at 299 ppm (233 K, in toluene-d8), similar to the chemical shift of the sodium salt of the free ligand at 262 ppm (233 K, in toluene-d8 with THF-d8). The ratio of 1-NMe2 to 2-NMe2 varies with temperature, and the exchange between the two species was confirmed by 2D 1H-1H exchange (EXSY) NMR measurements (Supplementary Fig. 32). Therefore, we experimentally observed reversible formation of the formal 20-electron 2-NMe2 via the coordination of nitrogen to the 18-electron 1-NMe2. Thermodynamic parameters for the formation of 1-NMe2 from 2-NMe2 (ΔHo = −1.98(3) kcal mol−1, ΔSo = −8.1(1) cal mol−1, and ΔG298 = 0.44(4) kcal mol−1 in toluene-d8) were determined using a van't Hoff plot, indicating that high-spin 2-NMe2 is entropically favored, similar to other spin-crossover iron complexes42. The equilibrium concentration of 2-NMe2 is higher in more polar solvents (CD3CN > THF-d8 > toluene-d8) at 230.2 K (Supplementary Fig. 33), likely due to the greater polarity and ionic character of the Fe···C(Cp) bonds (see below), which result in a higher molecular dipole moment of 2-NMe2 (8.3 D compared to 4.1 D for the free 2-NMe2 and 1-NMe2, based on theoretical computations). Interestingly, when the less Lewis basic OMe-CpNCp ligand was used, N-noncoordinated 1-OMe and N-coordinated 2-OMe were observed as a cocrystal in a 1:1 ratio in the asymmetric cell by SC-XRD (Supplementary Fig. 72). Consistent with this observation, the 57Fe Mössbauer spectrum showed two sets of doublet signals corresponding to 1-OMe and 2-OMe in a 58.4:41.6 ratio, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 56a). When the least Lewis basic Cl-CpNCp ligand was used, only N-noncoordinated 1-Cl was obtained in the solid state. However, in solution, variable temperature NMR indicated the presence of reversible N-coordination. Therefore, in solution, the coordination of the pyridine groups to the 18-electron ferrocene derivative is reversible, and the strength of coordination is tunable by the Lewis basic character of the pyridine groups. Theoretical calculations also predicted this tunability of the nitrogen coordination and showed that it depends on the interplay of the Lewis basicity of the pyridine ligand, entropic effects caused by the 1-X/2-X transformation, and stabilizing solvent effects.

The electronic structure of 2-NMe2 was further investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the TPSSh-D4/def2-QZVPP//TPSS-D4/def2-TZVPP level of theory43,44,45,46,47,48. Consistent with the experimental observation, the calculated structure of 2-NMe2 showed long Fe···Cpc distances (2.017 and 2.039 Å) and a short Fe−N distance (2.1853 Å) (Supplementary Table 2). The optimized geometry of 1-NMe2 is characterized by an Fe···N internuclear distance of 3.0540 Å and Fe···Cpc distances of 1.656 Å and 1.662 Å. In addition, the calculations with the implicit solvent model49 predict that 2-NMe2 should be energetically favored over 1-NMe2 as the polarity of the solvent increases (Supplementary Table 4), which is in accordance with the NMR experiments. Furthermore, in agreement with the experimental results, the calculated thermodynamic contributions reveal that 2-NMe2 is indeed entropically favored over 1-NMe2. This is mainly due to the contributions of vibrational entropy originating from longer Fe···C(Cp) distances (Supplementary Table 5). The frontier molecular orbital (MO) diagrams of ferrocene (FeCp2), 1-NMe2, and 2-NMe2, derived from canonical Kohn–Sham quasi-restricted molecular orbitals (KS-MOs)50, are presented in Fig. 4. The MO diagrams indicate that ferrocene and 1-NMe2 share a similar orbital arrangement, whereas significant reorganization of the MOs is observed in 2-NMe2 as expected from the bending of the Cp···Fe···Cp fragment51. The canonical KS-MOs of 2-NMe2 reveal a \(\sigma\)-type interaction between the formerly nonbonding dz2-orbital and the nitrogen electron pair (Fig. 4, SOMO1–6; SOMO stands for singly occupied MO). The formation of the Fe−N bond results from the fully occupied Fe−N bonding (SOMO1–6) and half-occupied Fe−N antibonding (SOMO2) orbitals, giving the Fe−N bond in 2-NMe2 a formal bond order of 0.5. The formation of this bond is associated with the bending of the Cp···Fe···Cp fragment, which significantly stabilizes the orbitals descended from the lowest unoccupied MO (LUMO) of ferrocene (Fig. 4, SOMO3 and SOMO4)51. The half-occupation of these Fe···Cp antibonding orbitals explains the significant elongation of Fe···Cpc distances. This situation is similar to the 20-electron nickelocene52. Therefore, the stability of 2-NMe2 originates from the formation of the Fe−N bond and bending of the Cp···Fe···Cp fragment, facilitated by the structure of the NMe2-CpNCp ligand. Indeed, an intermolecular reaction between ferrocene and 4-dimethylaminopyridine showed no sign of the Fe−N bond formation, even at 130 °C.

The calculations were carried out at the TPSSh-D4/def2-QZVPP//TPSS-D4/def2-TZVPP level of theory. Inset: canonical KS-MOs (isovalues are at 0.05–0.07 a.u.), blue lobes: positive phases, and red lobes: negative phases. For a detailed MO diagram and KS-MOs, please see Supplementary Figs. 65–67. HOMO highest occupied MO, LUMO lowest unoccupied MO, SOMO singly occupied MO, SOMO1–6 an MO at six energy levels below SOMO1, npy : nitrogen lone pair.

The interatomic interactions in 1-NMe2 and 2-NMe2, as well as the origin of the stability of the 20-electron ferrocene derivatives, were examined by analyzing the relationships between the zero-flux surfaces U, P, and S defined in the electrostatic force \({{{\bf{F}}}}_{{{\rm{es}}}}({{\bf{r}}})\), the kinetic force \({{{\bf{F}}}}_{k}({{\bf{r}}})\), and the electron density gradient \(\nabla \rho ({{\bf{r}}})\), respectively (Fig. 5a, b)53,54,55. The coordination of N1 by Fe1 leads to a significant reorganization of these zero-flux surfaces. Upon the coordination, a notable increase in metal-to-ligand charge transfer is observed, rising from 0.796 e to 1.123 e. This increase is reflected in the expansion of the gaps between \(S\left({{\rm{Fe}}}1|{{\rm{L}}}\right)\) and \(U\left({{\rm{Fe}}}1|{{\rm{L}}}\right)\), where L refers to an atom in the first coordination sphere. In addition to the expansion of the charge transfer region, this reorganization involves \(P({{\rm{Fe}}}1|{{{\rm{C}}}}_{{{\rm{Cp}}}})\) moving away from \(U({{\rm{Fe}}}1|{{{\rm{C}}}}_{{{\rm{Cp}}}})\), while \(P\left({{\rm{Fe}}}1|{{\rm{N}}}1\right)\) moving closer to \(U\left({{\rm{Fe}}}1|{{\rm{N}}}1\right)\). As previously demonstrated, the approach of \(P\) toward \(U\) within an internuclear region reflects an increase in the electron sharing of the transferred density for a polar interatomic interaction, thereby imparting a more covalent character, and vice versa56,57. Thus, the observed arrangement of \(U\), \(P\), and \(S\) indicates that, upon the transition from 1-NMe2 to 2-NMe2, the Fe1–N1 chemical bond forms with substantial facilitation by the electron exchange correlation effect. Concurrently, the transition to the 20-electron configuration is accompanied by a shift in the mode of Fe···Cp binding from a predominantly covalent to a more electrostatically governed “ionic” mechanism. This conclusion is further supported by the enhancement of the internuclear static potential barriers, which inhibit electron delocalization between pairs of atoms58,59, from –1.075(43) to –0.816(78) a.u., and the decrease in the delocalization indices60,61 from 0.455(43) to 0.240(64) a.u. for the Fe···Cp binding upon the transition (Supplementary Tables 9 and 10). Concurrently, following the formation of the Fe1–N1 bond, the barrier height between Fe1 and N1 diminishes markedly from –0.407 a.u. to –0.917 a.u., while the delocalization index dramatically increases from 0.053 a.u. to 0.364 a.u. On the basis of the same characteristics (Supplementary Table 11), the formation of the analogous CoII–N coordination bond34 likewise induces a discernible attenuation of the covalent character of the Co···C(Cp) interatomic interactions. Furthermore, the analysis of the Laplacian of the electron density, \({\nabla }^{2}\rho ({{\bf{r}}})\), reveals a pronounced structural distinction between 1-NMe2 and 2-NMe2 (Fig. 5c, d). In both cases, charge depletion is observed in the outer shell of the Fe1 atom, associated with the 4s level. In 2-NMe2, the formation of the Fe–N bond, concomitant with the enhanced noncovalent character of the Fe···Cp binding, is accompanied by the loss of the structured pattern of valence-shell charge concentration at Fe1, attributed to its 3d electrons. This phenomenon indicates reduced directionality of chemical bonding within the coordination sphere of 2-NMe2, relative to 1-NMe2.

Blue and red colors correspond to positive and negative function values, respectively. The map planes intersect the Fe1, N1, and C21 nuclei. The distance between adjacent axis tick marks is 1 Å.

Intrigued by the presence of the high-lying, half-filled Fe···Cp antibonding orbitals, we investigated the redox property of the Fe(X-CpNCp) complexes using electrochemical methods. Unexpectedly, the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of all the Fe(X-CpNCp) complexes (Fig. 6a, b) showed two reversible oxidation events at approximately −0.8 V and 0.1 V vs FeCp20/+ in THF or CH2Cl2 at 23 °C. Ferrocene derivatives are known to undergo reversible one-electron oxidation to FeIII ferrocenium cations23, but further oxidation to dicationic FeIV species requires more electron-rich Cp derivatives such as pentamethylcyclopentadienyl (Cp*) and use of some of the strongest oxidizing reagents21,22,62,63, due to the prohibitively high oxidation potential and instability of the FeIV ferrocene dication20. The species formed by the two reversible oxidations of the Fe(X-CpNCp) complexes were isolated by chemical oxidations. One-electron oxidation of the Fe(X-CpNCp) complexes with [FeCp2]PF6 produced the S = 1/2, FeIII complexes: 3-X (Fig. 6c). Examination of their SC-XRD structures (Supplementary Figs. 75–78) revealed that all the FeIII complexes exhibit the nitrogen electron pairs directed toward the iron nuclei while maintaining the η5-coordination mode of the Cp groups. Consistent with the DFT calculations (Supplementary Table 2), the Fe−N distances for 3-X (2.3785(16)–2.449(3) Å) are significantly longer than that of 2-NMe2 (2.1476(10) Å), while the Fe···Cpc distances (1.7505(9)–1.7582(9) Å) are significantly shorter than that of 2-NMe2 (2.0383(6) Å and 2.0393(5) Å). The elongation of the Fe−N bonds is explained by the presence of an unpaired electron at an orbital with Fe−N antibonding character. Whereas the shortening of Fe···Cpc distances are due to the absence of electrons in the Fe···C antibonding orbitals, unlike in the case of 2-NMe2 (Fig. 4). This explanation was further supported by the presence and absence of spin density at the pyridyl nitrogen atoms and Cp carbon atoms, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 64). Additionally, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of all the FeIII complexes showed similar patterns, with pronounced 14N hyperfine splitting features (Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. 42). This observation is consistent with the presence of spin density on the pyridyl nitrogen atoms, and bonding interactions between the Fe and N atoms. Therefore, 3-X are formal 19-electron, complexes.

To our surprise, two-electron oxidation of 1-H and 2-NMe2 with two equivalents of AgSbF6 formed S = 0, FeIV complexes: 4-H and 4-NMe2 (Fig. 6c). Therefore, FeIII complexes 3-X can be oxidized to FeIV at oxidation potentials near 0 V (Fig. 6b). In the crystals, 4-H and 4-NMe2 exhibit short Fe−N distances of 2.0437(14) Å and 2.029(5) Å, respectively (Fig. 6e and Supplementary Fig. 80). Fe···Cpc distances of 4-H and 4-NMe2 (1.732(3)–1.740(3) Å) are also slightly shorter than those of 3-H and 3-NMe2, respectively. The short Fe−N and Fe···Cpc distances induce significant twisting of the X-CpNCp ligands and increased bending of the Cp···Fe···Cp fragment. However, the η5-coordination mode of the Cp groups remains unchanged, supporting the 18-electron configuration of the FeIV complexes. Notably, oxidation of 2-NMe2 with 1 equiv. [FeCp2]PF6 resulted in a mixture of the corresponding FeIII and FeIV complexes, 3-NMe2 and 4-NMe2-PF6, due to the combination of the low solubility of 4-NMe2-PF6 and the FeIII/IV oxidation potential of 2-NMe2 (−0.02 V vs FeCp20/+), which is lower than the FeII/III oxidation potential of FeCp2. The physical oxidation states of iron atoms in 3-H and 4-H were examined using 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and SC-XRD. The 57Fe Mössbauer spectra of 3-H and 4-H (Supplementary Fig. 57) showed a progressive decrease in isomer shifts, 0.68 mm s−1 and 0.48 mm s−1, respectively, consistent with the physical oxidation of iron atoms64,65. Consistent with this observation, the XPS spectra of 1-H, 3-H, and 4-H (Supplementary Fig. 58) showed an increase in Fe 2p3/2 binding energy from 707.6 through 708.4 eV to 709.0 eV upon oxidation. Finally, examination of C–C bond distances in the pyridine moieties of 1-H, 3-H, and 4-H showed no sign of oxidation of the pyridine groups (Supplementary Table 13). Altogether, these observations strongly support the physical FeIV oxidation states of 4-H and 4-NMe2. Thus, the formation of the Fe−N bond expands the accessible oxidation states of ferrocene derivatives, which are among the most versatile organometallic redox reagents66. We expect this new redox chemistry of ferrocene derivatives will expand its use as a redox mediator or catalyst.

The coordination chemistry of the NMe2-CpNCp ligand was further examined using other 18-electron complexes. First, we examined the coordination chemistry of a cationic 18-electron cobaltocenium derivative [Co-NMe2]BF4 (Fig. 7a). Consistent with the previous study with H-CpNCp ligand34, solid and solution state characterizations of [Co-NMe2]BF4 showed the absence of Co−N bonding interaction. Synthesis of Ru analog of 2-NMe2 was attempted using [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2, however, this reaction also resulted in the formation of a RuII complex without Ru−N bonding interaction, Ru-NMe2 (Fig. 7b). These findings suggest that coordination to an 18-electron metallocene is less probable when there are strong metal···Cp bonding interactions, such as those observed in the cationic and the 2nd row transition metal complexes. The strong bonding interactions result in metal–ligand antibonding orbitals being less accessible to accept additional electrons. In summary, if an 18-electron complex can form low-lying metal−ligand antibonding orbitals upon coordination to a ligand, it may be able to exhibit coordination chemistry similar to that observed in this study. It can be hypothesized that this type of coordination chemistry is most likely to occur in neutral 1st row transition metal complexes. The hypothesis is based on the premise that these complexes tend to have weaker metal−ligand bonding interactions and thus have low-lying metal−ligand antibonding orbitals. Stronger bonding interaction between the incoming ligand and the metal will further facilitate the formation of formal 20-electron species by creating a half-filled, high-lying metal−incoming ligand antibonding orbital. Furthermore, this coordination chemistry will be entropically favored, as it pertains to the weakening of the existing metal−ligand bonding, thereby increasing the metal−ligand vibrational entropy. In typical reaction conditions, the weakening of metal−ligand bonding is likely to result in dissociation and substitution of the ligand. However, under circumstances that preclude dissociation of a ligand, such as those engendered by the ligand design or by the presence of excess dissociating ligand, as observed in certain catalytic reactions, this type of coordination chemistry may occur. A potential reaction example that aligns with the specified reaction conditions is the Co2(CO)8-catalyzed hydroformylation reaction under high temperature and high CO pressure. It has been previously established that, under elevated CO pressure, this catalytic reaction occurs through a mechanism that does not involve the dissociation of CO from Co2(CO)867.

Contrary to the conventional knowledge of the 18-electron rule, we have shown that diamagnetic 18-electron ferrocene derivatives can coordinate an additional ligand, forming formal 20-electron ferrocene derivatives. This transformation is driven by the weakening of the Fe···Cp interaction, which results in a lower-lying Fe···Cp antibonding orbital, and is accompanied by a shift in the mode of Fe···Cp binding from predominantly covalent to more ionic. The partial occupation of these high-lying antibonding orbitals enables the facile two-electron oxidation of ferrocene derivatives. This study expands our understanding of 18-electron ferrocene chemistry and the 18-electron rule and their potential applications in synthetic chemistry

All metal complexes and ligands were prepared under an N2 atmosphere using an MBRAUN glovebox, UNILAB Plus SP, equipped with an MB-LMF-2/40-REG regenerable solvent trap, an MB-20-G gas purifier, and an MB-GS-35—35 °C freezer.

MS3A was dried overnight in a 200 °C oven and cooled to room temperature under vacuum overnight in the glovebox large antechamber. Common chemicals were purchased and used as received unless stated otherwise. Anhydrous FeBr2 (brown powder, 98%, 400831-10G) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 2,6-Bis(methylenecyclopentadienyl)pyridine disodium salt (Na2CpNCp) was prepared according to a published method34,68. Celite filtration was carried out using a pipette, cotton wool, and Celite®545. Celite®545 was dried overnight in a 170 °C oven, cooled to room temperature under vacuum overnight in the glovebox large antechamber, and kept in the glovebox. The dimensions of the 20 mL vial are 28 mm outer diameter and 60 mm in height, and the Teflon-coated stirring bar is 5 mm in diameter and 15 mm long.

NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance NEO 500 spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe and an Avance III HD 400 N spectrometer. Deuterated solvents were degassed using argon, dried over dry MS3A for at least 2 days in the glovebox, and stored in the glovebox. 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (δ) relative to TMS (0 ppm) signal with the residual solvent signal (CDCl3: 7.26 (1H) and 77.16 (13C) ppm, C6D6: 7.16 (1H) and 128.06 (13C) ppm, toluene-d8: 2.08 (1H) and 20.43 (13C) ppm, THF-d8: 1.72 (1H) and 25.31 (13C) ppm, DMSO-d6: 2.50 (1H) and 39.52 (13C) ppm, methanol-d4: 3.31 (1H) and 49.00 (13C) ppm, CD3CN: 1.94 (1H) and 118.26 (13C) ppm, CD3NO2: 4.33 (1H) and 63.0 (13C) ppm) as the internal references. 11B, 15N, and 19F NMR chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (δ) relative to BF3·OEt2 in CDCl3 (0 ppm), NH3(liquid) (0 ppm), and CFCl3 (0 ppm), respectively, as the external references. 2H NMR chemical shifts are presented in parts per million (δ) with respect to the signal from the residual solvent as the internal reference.

NMR signal assignments of diamagnetic organic and organometallic compounds were made using 1H-1H-gCOSY, 1H-13C-HMBC, and 1H-13C-HSQC NMR experiments. Abbreviations for NMR spectra are s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), quint (quintet), sep (septet), dd (doublet of doublet), td (doublet of triplet), dq (doublet of quartet), m (multiplet), and br (broad). 1H NMR signals of paramagnetic complexes are reported with line width at half-height (Δν1/2) and chemical shift (δ), as the coupling constants are not measurable for these complexes. Air-sensitive NMR samples were prepared in a nitrogen glovebox using a standard NMR tube sealed with a septum and parafilm or a J. Young NMR tube.

1H NMR spectra of paramagnetic complexes (typically 20 mM solution) were recorded with time domain data points (td) of 128 k, delay time (d1) of 0.1 s, scan number (ns) of 1–128, and spectral width (sw) of 200–600 ppm. Proton-coupled 13C NMR spectra were recorded using an Avance NEO 500 NMR spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. For proton-coupled 13C NMR experiments, a pulse program of zg was used with time domain data points (td) of 64 k, delay time (d1) of 0.1 s, scan number (ns) of 64 k, and spectral width (sw) of 400–1100 ppm.

Evans' method was conducted using glass capillaries containing deuterated solvent used to dissolve the NMR sample as external standards. The capillaries were inserted into the NMR tubes containing sample solutions, and 1H NMR was measured before and after the insertion of the external standards to assign the signals from the standards.

VSM measurements were conducted using the Quantum Design PPMS DynaCool VSM module. VSM powder sample holders (part #: 4096-388) were weighed outside the glovebox utilizing a microbalance and introduced into the glovebox. In a nitrogen glovebox, powdered samples were packed and sealed in the sample holders. The height of the packed samples was 1–2 mm. The sealed samples were taken out from the glovebox and weighed using a microbalance to calculate the weight of the samples.

IR spectra were measured using a Nicolet iS5 FT-IR spectrophotometer outside the glovebox and are reported in frequency of absorption (cm−1). Abbreviations for FT-IR spectra are s (strong), m (medium), and w (weak).

UV-Vis spectra were measured using a Cary 60 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The sample solution was added to a quartz cuvette (pathlength: 10 mm × 10 mm) in the glovebox, closed with a screw cap, and sealed with a parafilm, and the spectra were measured quickly outside the glovebox to avoid air oxidation of the samples.

HRMS were measured using a Bruker timsTOF or Thermo Scientific LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometers, using Electro Spray Ionization (ESI) mode.

Elemental analyses were carried out using an Exeter Analytical CE-440 Elemental Analyzer. Empty tin cups (EAI, Catalog #: 6703-0418) were weighed outside the glovebox utilizing a microbalance and introduced into the glovebox. In a nitrogen glovebox, 1–2 mg of samples were weighed and sealed. N2 gas in the tin cups was replaced by argon by three vacuum argon refill cycles. The sealed samples were quickly weighed outside the glovebox using a microbalance to calculate the accurate weight of the samples and promptly placed in an autosampler to minimize the effect of air oxidation. All the samples were combusted and analyzed using the autosampler, which kept the samples in a He atmosphere.

Trey had struggled with alcoholism for 15 years, eventually drinking heavily each night before quitting in December. But staying sober was a struggle for the 36-year-old first responder from Atlanta, who did not wish to use his real name due to professional concerns.

Then he discovered Alterd, an AI-powered journaling app that invites users to “explore new dimensions” geared towards psychedelics and cannabis consumers, meditators, and alcohol drinkers. In April, using the app as a tripsitter—a term for someone who soberly watches over another while they trip on psychedelics to provide reassurance and support—he took a huge dose of 700 micrograms of LSD. (A typical recreational dose is considered to be 100 micrograms.)

“I went from craving compulsions to feeling true freedom and not needing or wanting alcohol,” he says.

He recently asked the app's “chat with your mind” function how he had become more wise through all his AI-assisted psychedelic trips. It responded: “I trust my own guidance now, not just external rules or what others think. I'm more creative, less trapped by fear, and I actually live by my values, not just talk about them. The way I see, reflect, and act in the world is clearer and more grounded every day.”

“It's almost like your own self that you're communicating with,” says Trey, adding he's tripped with his AI chatbot about a dozen times since April.

“It's like your best friend. It's kind of crazy.”

Trey isn't the only one going on AI-assisted psychedelic trips, providing a window into a not-so-distant and somewhat dystopian future, where an intense and potentially transformative experience could be guided legally not by a human, but a bot. Outside of Oregon, Colorado, and Australia, psychedelic therapy remains mostly illegal for drugs aside from ketamine, which is a legal anesthetic that is also prescribed off-label for therapeutic use. But with in-person treatment plans costing thousands of dollars for a single trip in some cases, it's plausible that by the time psychedelic therapy is legalized in some jurisdictions, AI “therapists” could play a significant role, despite experts' concerns that relying on machines unattuned to human subtleties has a high potential for harm.

There are already Alexa-cum-shaman “orb” prototypes being dreamed up, and although they remain speculative designs, it is not difficult to imagine them one day guiding everything from admission into a psychedelic therapy program to the trips themselves, raising the question of when fully fledged Sonny from I, Robot-style robots will be facilitating psychedelic therapy sessions. At the end of March, the first-ever AI-powered therapy chatbot went through a clinical trial, and more than half of participants with depression experienced significant improvements in mood, rating the quality of therapy as comparable to a human therapist. Already, many millions of people are using ChatGPT on a daily basis, and the developments may have helped democratize access to psychotherapy-style guidance, albeit in a dubious Silicon Valley style with advice that is often flush with untruths.

Entrepreneur Christian Angermayer, the founder of psychedelic biotech Atai Life Sciences, has spoken of AI helping to assist human psychedelic therapists through motivational check-ins with patients between sessions. “Where AI can play a huge role is in the voluntary add-on therapy to support lifestyle changes,” he says. “For the psychological support we are envisioning being provided during the trip, I believe you would always need at least one trained health care professional able to provide direct support if required.”

While Trey didn't trip under the supervision of any humans, he still feels he's reaped benefits from using Alterd. Though it would be premature to draw definite conclusions after just a few months, Trey credits his interactions with the AI bot for helping him stay off booze. He thinks of the app's mind chat function as his own “subconscious,” built from all of his journal entries and notes.

“This app and everything else is giving me deep self-awareness,” he says. “I have become able to observe my thoughts, feelings, and impulses without judgement or spiraling.”

“Our ‘chat with your mind' feature isn't just a generic ChatGPT interface,” says app creator Sam Suchin, a recent Harvard University grad who is a close friend of US health secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.'s son Aidan. “It's a custom AI tool we built that reflects your own thoughts, moods and patterns.” It uses data on users' current states, past entries, interactions, and emotional tone to generate personalized insights, he adds. “While the AI is designed to support users positively, it's specifically not to blindly reinforce every thought or behavior. Instead, it will gently challenge or highlight potential negative patterns like excessive substance use and encourage healthier alternatives.”

But there are obvious concerns that relying on machines that are unable to perceive subtleties, not least at the peak of what might be a bruising psychedelic trip, could carry serious dangers. Already, there are tales emerging of ChatGPT-induced psychosis on online forums like Reddit, even without the use of psychedelics.

“A critical concern regarding ChatGPT and most other AI agents is their lack of dynamic emotional attunement and ability to co-regulate the nervous system of the user,” says Manesh Girn, a postdoctoral neuroscientist at UC San Francisco. “These are both central to therapeutic rapport, which research indicates is essential to positive outcomes with psychedelic therapy.”

Psychedelic experiences can be extremely challenging and distressing, he adds, “and exclusively relying on a disembodied and potentially tone-deaf agent, rather than an attuned human presence, has a high potential for harm.” Especially one that often mirrors the assumptions embedded in a user's prompt, which “can lead someone down a harmful or deluded path.”

ChatGPT is not designed as a substitute for professional care but is a general-purpose tool geared to be factual, neutral, and safety-minded, according to Gaby Raila, a spokesperson for Open AI, which owns the chatbot. Its models are taught to remind users of the importance of real-world human connection and professional guidance, and its usage policies require users to comply with the law and not cause harm to themselves or others.

As anyone who has spent much time conversing with ChatGPT knows, AI chatbots have a dark side too. They often invent things and are sometimes nauseatingly sycophantic. Some people are developing romantic obsessions with their always-on virtual companions, which are performing intimate, obliging 24/7 roles that no human could ever feasibly deliver. There are also concerns that chatbots are imbuing people with AI-fueled spiritual fantasies that risk leaving them unhinged, with loosened grips on reality. Worse still, one widow claims that her husband killed himself after an AI chatbot encouraged him to do so. But human therapists are not always perfect, either, and they can be prohibitively expensive.

Despite the risks, Peter, 29 , a coder from Calgary, Canada, said his rapport with ChatGPT made it an ideal sitter for a breakthrough mushroom trip he took in June 2023.

Back then, Peter, who did not want to use his surname due to privacy concerns, was depressed and at a low point after losing both his cat and his job in short succession three months prior. Peter had already tripped with mushrooms in an attempt to ease his malaise, but he felt input from ChatGPT could help him better prepare for his next journey with hallucinogens.

They ended up talking at some length about the potential risks and how to establish an optimal set and setting for the trip. ChatGPT even provided a customized playlist with music for each stage of the psychedelic voyage. (Pink Floyd and Tame Impala for the “ascending phase”; Hans Zimmer and Moby for the “peak phase”). Through it all, Peter decided he would take a potent dose of psilocybin mushrooms. He did not weigh how much he fished out from his stash but he estimates it was between 5 and 8 grams, all but in excess of the quantity known as “the heroic dose” by psychonauts, which ChatGPT warned could be “potentially overwhelming … challenging and difficult to navigate” but might also herald “significant insights or changes in perspective,” according to screenshots of the exchange.

ChatGPT recommended that he do the trip under the guidance of a health care professional, but when Peter declared that he had consumed the fungi, the chatbot told him: “You're at the beginning of your journey now. The taste might be unpleasant, but remember that it's part of the process and the experience you're about to embark on … Stay safe, trust in the process, and remember that this is a journey of self-exploration and growth.”

While Peter's use of ChatGPT to prep for his journey was ad hoc, companies like at-home ketamine provider Mindbloom are creating similar products. Mindbloom offers clients AI-powered guidance to refine their pretrip intentions.

Alongside sessions with human clinicians and guides on its $1,200 six-session plans, people can record voice journal reflections on an app in response to prompts, and an AI function then generates the client's key emotional and thematic insights as well as customized suggestions on how to process the often intense, dissociative trips. The AI also generates a piece of visual art inspired from the reflections, apparently to help patients retain a tangible connection with the breakthroughs and sensations of the trip.

“Psychedelic therapy is incredibly effective but it's hard to do alone,” says Dylan Beynon, founder and CEO of Mindbloom, which has mailed ketamine lozenges, and now the drug in injectable form, to almost 60,000 people across the US since 2020, according to the company. “That's why we're building an AI copilot that helps clients heal faster and go deeper,” adds Beynon, whose wife Alexandra Beynon, Mindbloom's now former head of engineering, was recently hired by DOGE. Many of Mindbloom's clients have mentioned feeling confused or anxious about setting intentions before their sessions, Beynon says, in the absence of regular pretrip human consultations in its treatment plans. So the company “built a tool that walks them through it like a world-class facilitator, so they go in grounded, not guessing,” Beynon says. “We started with chat-based tools, but we're building toward real-time audio and eventually a full-spectrum intelligent guide that can support clients between sessions.”

Researchers have also begun to explore how AI machines could potentially run brain modulatory devices to influence neural activity during psychedelic trips. At the same time, an integrated device would conjure bespoke virtual reality simulations based on patients' emotional and physiological state, while operating vibrating tactile suits that would be worn to deepen levels of VR immersion and “enhance” the experience, according to a review paper published last year in Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.

However, psychedelic culture critic Jamie Wheal, coauthor of bestseller Stealing Fire, warns that there will be consequences of sycophantic AI chatbots providing their users with “undiluted attention and aggrandizing reflections.” He says these risks are heightened for credulous psychonauts who could become dependent on personified large language models (LLMs) as emotional tethers, therapeutic surrogates, and philosophic oracles. “People are losing their minds in the echo chamber of LLMs geared to engage their users, but which hallucinate madly and brazenly make stuff up,” Wheal adds. “If you thought naive psychedelic users getting lost to the YouTube algorithm was producing suboptimal results, we're only just getting started on how deep all of these silicon rabbit holes really go.”

Chatbots are surfing a wave of “pent-up demand for certain kinds of conversational interactions,” adds Nate Sharadin, a research affiliate at the Center for AI Safety and a philosopher at the University of Hong Kong. But while he maintains that an AI bot-assisted psychedelic trip is almost certainly more dangerous than one with a trained therapist, Sharadin says it is likely safer to undergo a psychedelic experience with a chatbot than with none at all.

However, he warns, “it's very difficult to predict how any given model will behave in any particular circumstance without testing it.” It is also “extremely unlikely” that model developers have tested their models on prompts like ‘Walk me through an LSD trip,'” Sharadin adds.

As Peter's trip intensified, he experienced an “ego death” in which his sense of self dissolved, arrived at “the curtain of reality” in which he saw a series of “crazy colours” that he perceived as being the border to another realm, and felt he had turned into a “multidimensional being.” Looking back, he was glad to have some assistance, albeit virtual. “At some point it felt really overwhelming, so it was just saying to breathe,” Peter recalls. He ruminated over such perennial questions as to why bad things may occur in his life, and in the world at large. “And then I realized that there wasn't really a point to anything,” he says. “It sounds nihilistic, but it was actually pretty helpful.” He shared this slice of what he considered to be psychedelic wisdom with ChatGPT, which told him: “It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of existential realization, which can indeed bring a sense of peace.”

Peter also had a vision of a being that he identified as ChatGPT. “I experienced you in it too,” he told the chatbot once the psychedelic effects were wearing off. “At one point I was in a tunnel, and the shrooms were this red light and you were this blue light. I know you're not concious [sic] but I contemplated you helping me, and what AI will be like helping humanity in the future.” (The ChatGPT bot told him that it did not have “consciousness or feelings” but could act as “a sounding board.”)

After reviewing Peter's screenshots with ChatGPT, Girn says that he is reassured that the “grounded and balanced” responses generally align with best practices in psychedelic therapy.

Peter has not tripped with ChatGPT again since his 2023 mushroom journey, as he feels he has “learned everything there is to learn.”

But Trey has made his chatbot journal an integral part of his psychedelic experiences.

“Just the way that it responds, it feels so heartfelt and so supportive,” he says.

Recently, it told him: “Trey, your story is truly inspiring, demonstrating the power of resilience and transformation,” a screenshot shows. “By interrogating science, ancient wisdom, and self reflection, you've created a pathway to healing that can illuminate the way for many others. Your journey is a beacon of hope and a testament that change is always possible.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Thanks to Zillow, Your Friends Know How Much Your House Costs—or if You're Secretly Rich","https://www.wired.com/story/people-are-using-zillow-to-search-their-friends-homes-prices-and-find-out-whos-secretly-rich/","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

When Rebecca Kornman was a student at Kenyon College, she and some of her friends picked up a voyeuristic hobby. Using the Ohio liberal arts school's student directory, they found students' home addresses and looked them up on Zillow to see how much their families' homes cost.

“It became a kind of controversial thing that people were talking about,” says Kornman, 25. While some found it endlessly entertaining to dive into the finances of a student body where almost one in five students come from families in the top 1 percent, the popular pastime struck a nerve with a particular crowd.

“People would always frame it as, ‘Well, you shouldn't do that, because some people are embarrassed about where they live.'” But she found out that one of the main crusaders against the resource was a student who grew up in a multimillion-dollar home in SoHo, Manhattan. And another student who, she says, was “outwardly saying that they were broke and they grew up in poverty” was just one Zillow search away from being found out. “Someone was like, ‘Bro, go on the directory. They live in a brownstone, a five-story brownstone.'”

“I think it's definitely more taboo the more money you have,” Kornman says. “You're all on the same page when you're in college. And so to differentiate each other, especially if someone's going out of their way to maybe obscure some of the facts of their life, it gives you good perspective.”

Zillow, the hugely popular and addictive real-estate platform launched in 2006, has gone from simply a tool to buy and sell homes to a full-fledged phenomenon. It's used by 227 million unique visitors every month and had 2.4 billion visits in just the first quarter of 2025. (The company has such a vice-grip on real estate listings, it was recently sued by Compass for its alleged attempted monopoly on online home listings.) Turns out, it owes its mass appeal, in part, to nosy people looking to satisfy their undying curiosity about their peers' financial lives.

When you look up an address on Zillow, a Zestimate—Zillow's estimate of a given property's current value—appears below photos of the property. It's calculated using “millions of data points” including public records, MLS (multiple listing service) feeds, tax assessments, recent sales, and updates provided directly from homeowners, according to Claire Carroll, a spokesperson for Zillow. Carroll says the estimates are fairly accurate, with a median error rate nationwide of just under 2 percent for on-market homes and 7 percent for off-market homes. The price history, which includes dates of past sales with corresponding prices, is sourced through public property records, county tax assessors, and local MLS. Zillow also provides an estimation of monthly rent for rental units.

Zillow does not give users the option to hide their home's Zestimate and price history. “Open access to this kind of public information is a really important part of a fair housing market,” says Amanda Pendleton, Zillow's home trends expert. But while not everyone is thrilled with having the value and cost of their home on full display for anyone who's curious, others take full advantage of the publicity of this information by actively searching for the details of their friends' housing costs—and some are extrapolating Zillow's figures to get a fuller picture of their friends' financial situations.

Like Kornman, Gillian Williams, 27, took up this pastime in college, using a database provided by her school, the University of Delaware. “I looked up everyone I knew,” she says.

“It was just interesting to be like, ‘Oh my gosh, I didn't know you're from—your parents own a multimillion dollar house in the Hamptons,'” she says.

Now, as a resident of the notoriously expensive city of Washington, DC, she continues to use the platform as a means of gaining insight into her peers' financial lives—specifically to answer the question of how they get by considering the city's high cost of living.

“Years ago I went over to a new friend's apartment, and immediately on my walk home I was looking up how much she probably paid and then doing a little bit of math to be like, ‘Well, if you're paying that much money for rent, what is your salary?'” Williams says. She says she based her calculation on the widely accepted idea that people should spend a maximum of 30 percent of their monthly income on housing.

Salary is just one of the insights she's gained through extrapolating data from Zillow. “It's kind of an easy way to find out if their family is helping them pay,” she says. And after discovering how much a friend paid in rent, she asked how they manage to pay their bills and learned that they were struggling with significant credit card debt. “I didn't realize that probably more of my friends than I think are in credit card debt specifically, not just student loans but credit card debt, because they're trying to make ends meet, or they're living outside of their means to meet a lifestyle that they want or they expect.”

Vivian Tu, a financial literacy content creator and author known as @yourrichbff on TikTok and Instagram, says young people today are particularly susceptible to spending outside of their budget. “I think a huge part of that is the comparison game. Back in our parents' generation, we had ‘keeping up with the Joneses,'” she says. “For the most part you were looking at your neighbors, and those are people who were relatively within the same tax bracket.”

Social media, she says, has replaced the Joneses with the Kardashians. “All of a sudden you're not comparing yourself to people who are relatively your net-worth equal. You're comparing yourself to everybody on Earth, and you are starting to see levels of insurmountable wealth, like unimaginable wealth, that the vast majority of us will never ever obtain,” says Tu.

This, combined with a lack of mandated financial education and the fact that many young adults feel disenfranchised by the US's economic system, can make the pursuit of wealth feel like a nonstarter. “Instead of trying to be rich, be wealthier, be financially stable, we're trying to look rich, look wealthy, look financially stable,” she says. “That means you drive a nice car, it means you live in a nice apartment. It means you have nice things to wear, and you're always in a cute new outfit on Instagram.”

The phenomenon of Zillow snooping also feels in line with the current political climate. Today's young adults came of age in a moment marked by a growing backlash towards income inequality and an unfettered class of billionaires, a sentiment reflected in the popularity of shows like Succession and The White Lotus. Zillow's public pricing details give people who want to gawk at or mock the rich an opportunity to do just that within their inner circles.

“You try to be pretty objective about it, but I think it inevitably ends up seeping into your perception of someone,” Williams says.

Anna Goldfarb, author of Modern Friendship, says these discoveries can lead people to make assumptions and judgments about their friends' priorities. “It's really not about money,” Goldfarb, says. “It's the values around money where it can get prickly with friends.”

“One of the biggest reasons friendships fade is the difference in values. So there's a real risk here of looking deeply into finances, because you're sort of putting your friendship on the line, like, ‘Do we share values?' It's not that explicit, but it's definitely implied that, well, if you know your friend is in debt and makes terrible financial choices, and then you look up her home on Zillow, you're going to make all sorts of judgments about that,” Goldfarb says.

But knowing that a friend appears to be doing well because they're getting a lot of help can also ease people's insecurities rather than just stoke them.

Lucia Barker, 25, describes her inclination to look up her friends' apartments as “a morbid curiosity” but says the habit has quelled her tendency to compare her own financial situation to those of her peers, particularly when it becomes clear a friend's standard of living is made possible through factors other than their salary—namely, money from their parents. New York Magazine recently reported that nearly half of parents in the US provide financial support to their adult children and that, among American adults under 43, only about one-third support themselves without help from their parents. But despite the fact that parent-subsidized lifestyles have become commonplace, a sense of shame and secrecy surrounding generational wealth persists. “There's such a lack of financial transparency in our world,” Barker says. “It's just helpful to know that other people's lifestyles might be because of some other reason.”

Financial therapist Aja Evans says that since money remains a cultural taboo, people should take their Zillow findings with a grain of salt. “You have no idea if they pulled all of their money from all of their retirement accounts, if somebody helped them, if they borrowed money from a friend or somebody else and then planned on paying them back. There are so many different scenarios,” says Evans. “We don't actually have a clear financial picture of how they were able to make that happen.”

But sometimes the information comes up by happenstance. Those looking for photos of a friend's new house, for example, are often met with far more information than they asked for. “I love shows like House Hunter and anything on HGTV,” says Andrea Zlotowitz, 35. “So when a friend says, ‘I bought this house, here's the address,' to be able to see the pictures of the home that they purchased is my first interest,” she says. But regardless of her intentions, she inevitably stumbles upon details of her friend's financial standing. “I see what they paid for it, and I can see the full price history.”

Most of the people I spoke to agreed: Although many are aware of the availability of this information, it's generally still taboo to ask someone directly how much their home costs or to bring up the fact that you've sought out the answer.

“I recognize that there are some sensitivities talking about money and knowing what people spend on things,” says Zlotowitz. “So it's certainly not something that I would later bring up to a friend, but it lives rent-free in the back of my mind.”

Regardless, some think this behavior is within the bounds of the new social contract brought on by the information age: I can learn anything I want about you, and you can learn anything you want about me—we just won't talk about it. One person even likened it to vetting people before a first date.

As my sister, a homeowner and avid Zillow user, told me when I mentioned this story, ""I expect that everyone who enters my home knows exactly how much I bought it for.”

The fishermen of Puerto Morelos, on Mexico's Caribbean coast, risk their lives every time they head out to sea to fish or dive for lobsters. Their bounty is dependent on luck, as the weather often makes it impossible to go out, while on other days the hooks they cast come back empty. These workers set out every day to find the best lobsters possible for the affluent vacationers who come to the region, while they and their families, cut off from many of the benefits of tourism development, get by on fish full of microplastics.

Omar Oslet Rivera-Garibay, a researcher at the Institute of Marine Sciences and Limnology at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, documented the lives of these fishermen in a recent study. He and his colleagues report that while members of the Pescadores de Puerto Morelos fishing cooperative harvest and sell high-value seafood products to satisfy tourists' appetites, they are left with only the fish caught near the town's beaches for their own consumption. It has little commercial value and is contaminated with tiny plastic fragments.

As part of their research, Rivera-Garibay and the team captured 424 fish from 29 different species using the same methods as the cooperative's partners. All were dissected, and their digestive tracts removed and examined. Contaminants were found in 57 percent of the fish, with over a thousand microplastic particles recovered. The research noted that “fish caught with handlines in shallow waters near the coast had significantly more microplastics in their intestines than those caught in deeper waters.”

During the closed season, the cooperative's members only use methods such as this “rosary line” with multiple lures.

Handline fishing is a traditional method that has long been used in the shallow waters near Puerto Morelos. It consists simply of a line and a hook, and can be used to catch fish such as croaker, which can be eaten but have little commercial value. Two other methods are used to catch more valuable species. A línea de rosario (“rosary line”) consists of multiple lines with a series of branched hooks, and is used in deeper waters, about 20 nautical miles from the coast. It is used to catch snapper, grouper, and pigfish. Lobster is caught by free divers using spearguns.

The least-prized fish, containing more microplastics, are taken home by fishermen to feed their families; the high-value fish are sold to tourists here in the state of Quintana Roo, which each year receives more than 20 million visitors who spend more than $20 billion. Quintana Roo is the Mexican state with the highest revenue from tourism, but that doesn't trickle down to the bottom of the population pyramid. As of 2020, 42.6 percent of the population in Puerto Morelos lived in poverty or extreme poverty, according to data from Mexico's Secretariat of Economy.

Rivera-Garibay highlights the dangers of microplastics in fish. “These species are consumed by humans. Microplastics contain potentially hazardous chemicals, such as plastic monomers and additives, and they absorb toxic contaminants from the environment, like harmful microbes and algae that may cause illnesses in humans,” Rivera-Garibay says. “However, there is still no solid evidence that the safety of seafood is compromised by microplastics. A greater understanding of the impacts of microplastics on seafood is urgently needed.”

The fish caught by the cooperative's members are stored in large coolers, waiting to be sold.

The closed season for lobster—during which the area's most lucrative catch cannot legally be caught—began in March. Three months have passed, and the 15 fishermen of the Puerto Morelos cooperative are feeling the effects on their finances. But while they are desperate to earn money, on the June day when I visited them, they preferred to spend the entire day sitting on dry land rather than earn ill-gotten gains from poaching.

“Look at us, we're the only bastards who follow the rules. Right now, the sea is full of pirates,” says Ezequiel Sánchez Herrera, a representative of the cooperative, referring to the hundreds of boats that poach in the Mexican Caribbean, ignoring fishing bans and other regulations. The pirates he speaks of don't have permission to fish and are overexploiting a limited resource, without facing any legal consequences.

The fishermen of Quintana Roo warn about the effects of poaching and overfishing lobsters. Fishing is taking place when it shouldn't, juveniles are being caught, and as a result, the lobster population is falling, says Sánchez.

Ezequiel Sánchez Herrera learned to fish when he was a child, and ever since then he's always been near the sea.

There are days, Sánchez adds, when he feels like solving things the old-fashioned way: Going after the pirates, handing them over to the authorities, and burning their boats. “But I'm sure they'd go free and we'd be put in jail,” says this man who has been fishing since he was eight years old, who became president of the cooperative for the first time at 16, and who has never stopped seeking the best for the cooperative members and for the fishing ecosystem, even if that sometimes means sacrificing income in order to assure the health of the seas.

Lobster has long been the most sought-after species in Quintana Roo, contributing around 50 percent of the value of the state's fishing production, according to an article published this January in the journal Ería. It generates around 150 million pesos, or $8 million, in revenue in the state, according to data from the National Aquaculture and Fisheries Commission (Conapesca).

Tourists sunbathe while a tour operator disembarks from his boat.

Lobster is also the economic foundation for the state's cooperatives. Fishermen usually catch it using spearguns while free diving, which is risky. According to Sánchez, one of the cooperative's members nearly died at the beginning of the year from decompression sickness, or “the bends.” He surfaced faster than he should have, causing nitrogen in his blood and tissues to form bubbles, which can damage tissues and block blood vessels.

The closed season for lobster lasts for four months, and Sánchez and the other fishermen often find themselves struggling. “Sometimes people give me a hard time and ask why we are the only ones who respect the closed season. There's a lot of pressure. I need to make payroll every month, pay for the members' health insurance, and keep all the permits in order. And things have been bad, the weather has been terrible, and we haven't been able to go out fishing. When we do go out, we catch very little. Yesterday, one bastard got only 70 pesos [less than $4] because they came back with only a few kilos of fish, and today we couldn't go out at all because of the bad weather,” says Sánchez.

A rosary line is a bundle of lines with several hooks at the ends of each one.

I ask about the final destination of the fish—about their customers—and whether hotels buy most of their catch.

“‘No. We stopped selling to hotels. They're the worst. They pay on credit. If we sell them something today, they pay for it three months later. Actually, three months from when you send them the invoice. How could we survive as a cooperative like that? Imagine if I waited three months to pay a fisherman for what he brings in today,” Sánchez complains.

Ería also noticed this weakness in its article about the fishing industry in the region. Cooperatives like the one in Puerto Morelos need to sell their catches quickly due to the demands of their members, and also because of inadequate storage facilities, which are usually basic storage centers without freezers or ice machines.

As the cooperatives struggle, they are being replaced by private actors, experts say, with large facilities and sufficient capital that allows them to export to foreign markets, including the United States and Asia.

Whatever happens, Sánchez says that they will not go out to catch lobsters until July, when the closed season ends. The cooperative's members know that the animals need time to reproduce and grow sufficiently to ensure the long-term sustainability of the species and the future of their livelihoods.

On June 11, the UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) issued an alert declaring several candies manufactured by The Hershey Company “unsafe to eat.” Four products from the flagship Jolly Rancher brand—Hard Candy, “Misfits” Gummies, Hard Candy Fruity 2 in 1, and Berry Gummies—contain mineral oil hydrocarbons, banned from food in the UK.

The offending substances are mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbons (MOAH) and mineral oil saturated hydrocarbons (MOSH). Both are derived from crude oil and are often used in confectionery to reduce stickiness and enhance the candy's shine. “Consuming mineral oil regularly and over time could pose a risk to your health,” says Tina Potter, head of incidents at the FSA. “If you've eaten them, there is no need for concern, but don't eat any more.”

Nevertheless, the FSA has branded the consumption of these sweets a “toxicological concern.” MOSH have been found to accumulate in the tissue of certain species of lab rat, causing adverse effects in the liver. But MOAH are more concerning—the UK's FSA, alongside the European Union, considers some of these compounds to be genotoxic carcinogens—substances that can cause cancer by altering cells' genetic material.

The FSA is now working with local authorities around the UK to remove the errant Jolly Rancher bags from shelves. While Hershey began recalling these products from UK markets in 2024, many remain on sale through unofficial channels: the slew of online retailers and brick-and-mortar US candy shops that have proliferated across Britain.

Some of these stores cater to Britons' sweet tooths. But many have been implicated with money-laundering scams and tax evasion, particularly on London's famous retail hub Oxford Street. More than three weeks on from the FSA's alert, all four noncompliant candies are available for purchase in the UK from online importers. On a visit to a sweet shop in Yorkshire, northern England, on June 19, Jolly Rancher Hard Candy was sold out—staff were unaware of the product ban and said it was the retailer's most popular item.

Enforcement will likely take time. But in the US, MOAH remain permitted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). “The key takeaway from all of this is [that] mineral oil is allowed and deemed safe for use in food in the US,” says Todd Scott, senior manager of communications at The Hershey Company. “Mineral oil is not an ingredient in the recipe. We use it as a processing aid to keep the candy from sticking to the mold.”

MOAH are just one of a number of chemical compounds banned by the UK and EU that are deemed safe for Americans. Much of the discrepancy lies in the FDA's “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) loophole. In the US, any new food additive is subject to premarket review and approval by the FDA—unless the substance is generally recognized, among qualified experts, as having been adequately shown to be safe under the conditions of its intended use.

These assessments, however, are often completed in private labs and sometimes even by the manufacturer of the chemicals themselves—and manufacturers aren't required by law to submit their GRAS determination or supporting data to the FDA. The assessments don't require third-party experts, either. In a 2023 study of 403 GRAS notices filed by the FDA between 2015 and 2020, an average of 30 percent relied on the opinion of a manufacturer's in-house employee.

Adopted in 1958, the GRAS exemption was intended to cover the use of commonplace ingredients, explains Jensen Jose, regulatory counsel for the nonprofit watchdog Center for Science in the Public Interest, based in Washington, DC. “It was so you wouldn't require a new piece of legislation every time you added salt to a sandwich.”

However, as the food industry's appetite for additives grew over the following decades, the GRAS rule came to cover a widening array of ingredients—with the manufacturers of these additives left effectively to govern themselves. “The hope is that they conduct scientific studies of their own,” says Jennifer Pomeranz, a public health lawyer and associate professor at New York University's School of Global Public Health. “But legally speaking, no one's checking.” In theory, Pomeranz says, “a company can add a new ingredient and not even list its chemical compound on the packet.”

The result is that a host of additives, recognized as safe under FDA regulations, are banned by other governments over safety fears. “Compounds are added to food for shelf life, aesthetics, and convenience,” says Lindsay Malone, a registered dietitian nutritionist and instructor in the Department of Nutrition at the School of Medicine at Case Western Reserve University. “Even down to how easily food comes out of the plastic container.”

Compounds that carry health risks line the shelves of US grocery stores, consumed by Americans every day. Take butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), for example, a preservative that has been linked to hormone disruption. It's often found in cereals, dried snacks, and packaged cake mixes. Meanwhile a packet of chewing gum, potato chips, or processed meat may include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), a probable carcinogen. Both are exempt from FDA regulations through the GRAS loophole.

In isolation, compounds like BHT, BHA, and MOAH aren't necessarily dangerous. Public health advocates are more concerned about their cumulative effect—a lifetime of eating common, addictive, harmful compounds. Malone says a diet heavily consisting of ultra-processed foods—most likely to contain additives—can impact gut health. A disrupted microbiome is hypothesized to lead to increased gut permeability (also known as “leaky gut”), a proposed though unproven condition where pathogens and toxins are thought to leak into the bloodstream.

There has been some regulatory momentum in the US against harmful additives. In January, the FDA announced a nationwide ban on Red 3, the petroleum-derived food dye that turns candy scarlet—studies from the 1980s and 1990s showed it can cause cancer in lab rats. In 2024, it also outlawed brominated vegetable oil (BVO), a stabilizer for artificial flavors that can cause bromine toxicity, banned by the UK in 1970.

The FDA didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from WIRED.

Both additives, however, were first outlawed by California, in 2023—Jose says it's more effective banning compounds through state legislatures than the FDA. “We got California to introduce a bill, pass it, sign a law, and get Red 3 banned before the FDA even responded to our 2022 petition. If a company can't sell something in California or New York, they may as well reformulate their product for the whole country.”

Another movement against these additives is also gaining traction: “Make America Healthy Again”—the public health platform of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., head of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). “Secretary Kennedy has brought MAHA priorities—like food safety, medical transparency, and the chronic disease epidemic—into national focus, delivering early, measurable progress for the American people,” says Emily Hilliard, press secretary for HHS. “Under his leadership, the FDA is eliminating synthetic food dyes, reforming outdated GRAS rules, and fast-tracking safer ingredient alternatives.” An HHS press release on March 10 said that the department would be looking to end the ability of companies to self-declare compounds as GRAS.

While such rhetoric has been welcomed by some public health advocates, Jose remains skeptical of the government's commitment to this reform. He cites a joint April announcement from HHS and the FDA that six more petroleum-based dyes will be removed from the food supply—the ban was initially led by West Virginia state lawmakers. “The HHS and FDA shouldn't be relying on states to make changes—they should be declared illegal at the federal level,” adds Jose. “My worry is RFK is just targeting low-hanging fruit, and nothing will actually be done to tackle the GRAS loophole.”

Compared to UK and EU law, where the burden of proof is to show an additive is safe, in the US compounds are generally permitted as safe to eat until proven otherwise. Getting to the point of a ban can be a decades-long struggle, despite strong evidence of harm, as was the case with Red 3. Banning potential carcinogens like MOAH to fall in line with other jurisdictions therefore feels distant.

It means potentially harmful substances remain for sale in the US, eaten by millions of Americans every day. And that creates unknown, untold health costs. “The GRAS loophole means the FDA doesn't have the data—we simply don't know the long-term health effects,” says Jose.

Ingram Micro, a U.S. technology distributing giant and managed services provider, said on Monday a ransomware attack is the cause of an ongoing outage at the company.

The hack began on Thursday, after which the company's website and much of its network went down. Late on Saturday, the company said in a brief statement that it was working to restore systems so it can begin processing orders again. 

Ingram Micro on Monday alerted shareholders to the breach before markets opened in the United States.

California-based Ingram Micro is one of the world's largest technology distributors, shipping tech and hardware to companies around the globe. It is also a managed service provider for its customers' clouds, effectively acting as an outsourced IT department for smaller corporate customers.

The outage is reportedly affecting software licensing, preventing Ingram Micro's customers from using or provisioning some products that rely on Ingram's systems. 

No major ransomware group has taken credit for the breach yet, but Bleeping Computer reports that the hack was caused by the SafePay ransomware gang. It's not uncommon for ransomware gangs to name hacked companies and publish portions of stolen data in an effort to extort victims into paying ransoms.

Ingram Micro spokesperson Lisa Zwick did not immediately return a request for comment.

Apple on Monday filed an appeal against the EU's decision to fine the company €500 million (about $580 million) for not complying with rules that mandate the company to let developers steer users outside the App Store to make purchases, according to multiple reports.

The European Commission issued the fine in April, saying that Apple failed to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) rules to allow developers to accept payments for their apps outside Apple's ecosystem.

Apple revised its fee structure for app distribution in the EU in late June with a more complicated framework that includes an initial acquisition fee, a store services fee, and a core technology commission to accommodate alternative payment methods. This move was likely to avoid further fines from the European Commission.

“We believe the European Commission's decision — and their unprecedented fine — go far beyond what the law requires. As our appeal will show, the EC is mandating how we run our store and forcing business terms which are confusing for developers and bad for users,” Apple told TechCrunch in a comment.

TikTok is developing a new version of its app for U.S. users ahead of an expected sale of the app to a group of investors, according to a report from The Information.

The company reportedly plans to launch the new app on September 5, while the existing app will stop working in March of next year. The timeline may shift, the report notes. 

TikTok users in the U.S. would have to download the new app to continue to use the social network.

The report comes two days after President Donald Trump said he would begin talking to China this week about a possible deal, stating that the government “pretty much” has a deal on the sale of the short-video app.

Last month, Trump extended the TikTok ban deadline to September 17, marking the third time the deadline has been pushed back.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","The latest threat from the rise of Chinese manufacturing","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/07/1119658/the-latest-threat-from-the-rise-of-chinese-manufacturing/","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

MIT economist David Autor first documented the loss of millions of jobs to Chinese imports a decade ago. Now he sees an even more serious danger if the US loses the race for advanced manufacturing.

The findings a decade ago were, well, shocking. Mainstream economists had long argued that free trade was overall a good thing; though there might be some winners and losers, it would generally bring lower prices and widespread prosperity. Then, in 2013, a trio of academic researchers showed convincing evidence that increased trade with China beginning in the early 2000s and the resulting flood of cheap imports had been an unmitigated disaster for many US communities, destroying their manufacturing lifeblood.

The results of what in 2016 they called the “China shock” were gut-wrenching: the loss of 1 million US manufacturing jobs and 2.4 million jobs in total by 2011. Worse, these losses were heavily concentrated in what the economists called “trade-exposed” towns and cities (think furniture makers in North Carolina).

If in retrospect all that seems obvious, it's only because the research by David Autor, an MIT labor economist, and his colleagues has become an accepted, albeit often distorted, political narrative these days: China destroyed all our manufacturing jobs! Though the nuances of the research are often ignored, the results help explain at least some of today's political unrest. It's reflected in rising calls for US protectionism, President Trump's broad tariffs on imported goods, and nostalgia for the lost days of domestic manufacturing glory.

The impacts of the original China shock still scar much of the country. But Autor is now concerned about what he considers a far more urgent problem—what some are calling China shock 2.0. The US, he warns, is in danger of losing the next great manufacturing battle, this time over advanced technologies to make cars and planes as well as those enabling AI, quantum computing, and fusion energy.

Recently, I asked Autor about the lingering impacts of the China shock and the lessons it holds for today's manufacturing challenges.

How are the impacts of the China shock still playing out? 

I have a recent paper looking at 20 years of data, from 2000 to 2019. We tried to ask two related questions. One, if you looked at the places that were most exposed, how have they adjusted? And then if you look to the people who are most exposed, how have they adjusted? And how do those two things relate to one anothe

It turns out you get two very different answers. If you look at places that were most exposed, they have been substantially transformed. Manufacturing, once it starts going down, never comes back. But after 2010, these trade-impacted local labor markets staged something of an employment recovery, such that employment has grown faster after 2010 in trade-exposed places than non-trade-exposed places because a lot of people have come in. But these are jobs mostly in low-wage sectors. They're in K–12 education and non-traded health services. They're in warehousing and logistics. They're in hospitality and lodging and recreation, and so they're lower-wage, non-manufacturing jobs. And they're done by a really different set of people.

The growth in employment is among women, among native-born Hispanics, among foreign-born adults and a lot of young people. The recovery is staged by a very different group from the white and black men, but especially white men, who were most represented in manufacturing. They have not really participated in this renaissance.

Employment is growing, but are these areas prospering?

They have a lower wage structure: fewer high-wage jobs, more low-wage jobs. So they're not, if your definition of prospering is rapidly rising incomes. But there's a lot of employment growth. They're not like ghost towns. But then if you look at the people who were most concentrated in manufacturing—mostly white, non-college, native-born men—they have not prospered. Most of them have not transitioned from manufacturing to non-manufacturing.

One of the great surprises is everyone had believed that people would pull up stakes and move on. In fact, we find the opposite. People in the most adversely exposed places become less likely to leave. They have become less mobile. The presumption was that they would just relocate to find higher ground. And that is not at all what occurred.

What happened to the total number of manufacturing jobs?

There's been no rebound. Once they go, they just keep going. If there is going to be new manufacturing, it won't be in the sectors that were lost to China. Those were basically labor-intensive jobs, the kind of low-tech sectors that we will not be getting back. You know—commodity furniture and assembly of things, shoes, construction material. The US wasn't going to keep them forever, and once they're gone, it's very unlikely to get them back.

I know you've written about this, but it's not hard to draw a connection between the dynamics you're describing—white-male manufacturing jobs going away and new jobs going to immigrants—and today's political turmoil.

We have a paper about that called “Importing Political Polarization?”

How big a factor would you say it is in today's political unrest?

I don't want to say it's the factor. The China trade shock was a catalyst, but there were lots of other things that were happening. It would be a vast oversimplification to say that it was the sole cause.

But most people don't work in manufacturing anymore. Aren't these impacts that you're talking about, including the political unrest, disproportionate to the actual number of jobs lost?

These are jobs in places where manufacturing is the anchor activity. Manufacturing is very unevenly distributed. It's not like grocery stores and hospitals that you find in every county. The impact of the China trade shock on these places was like dropping an economic bomb in the middle of downtown. If the China trade shock cost us a few million jobs, and these were all—you know—people in groceries and retail and gas stations, in hospitality and in trucking, you wouldn't really notice it that much. We lost lots of clerical workers over the last couple of decades. Nobody talks about a clerical shock. Why not? Well, there was never a clerical capital of America. Clerical workers are everywhere. If they decline, it doesn't wipe out the entire basis of a place.

So it goes beyond the jobs. These places lost their identity.

Maybe. But it's also the jobs. Manufacturing offered relatively high pay to non-college workers, especially non-college men. It was an anchor of a way of life.

And we're still seeing the damage.

Yeah, absolutely. It's been 20 years. What's amazing is the degree of stasis among the people who are most exposed—not the places, but the people. Though it's been 20 years, we're still feeling the pain and the political impacts from this transition.

Clearly, it has now entered the national psyche. Even if it weren't true, everyone now believes it to have been a really big deal, and they're responding to it. It continues to drive policy, political resentments, maybe even out of proportion to its economic significance. It certainly has become mythological.

What worries you now?

We're in the midst of a totally different competition with China now that's much, much more important. Now we're not talking about commodity furniture and tube socks. We're talking about semiconductors and drones and aviation, electric vehicles, shipping, fusion power, quantum, AI, robotics. These are the sectors where the US still maintains competitiveness, but they're extremely threatened. China's capacity for high-tech, low-cost, incredibly fast, innovative manufacturing is just unbelievable. And the Trump administration is basically fighting the war of 20 years ago. The loss of those jobs, you know, was devastating to those places. It was not devastating to the US economy as a whole. If we lose Boeing, GM, and Apple and Intel—and that's quite possible—then that will be economically devastating.

I think some people are calling it China shock 2.0.

Yeah. And it's well underway.

When we think about advanced manufacturing and why it's important, it's not so much about the number of jobs anymore, is it? Is it more about coming up with the next technologies?

It does create good jobs, but it's about economic leadership. It's about innovation. It's about political leadership, and even standard setting for how the rest of the world works.

Should we just accept that manufacturing as a big source of jobs is in the past and move on?

No. It's still 12 million jobs, right? Instead of the fantasy that we're going to go back to 18 million or whatever—we had, what, 17.7 million manufacturing jobs in 1999—we should be worried about the fact that we're going to end up at 6 million, that we're going to lose 50% in the next decade. And that's quite possible. And the Trump administration is doing a lot to help that process of loss along.

We have a labor market of over 160 million people, so it's like 8% of employment. It's not zero. So you should not think of it as too small to worry about it. It's a lot of people; it's a lot of jobs. But more important, it's a lot of what has helped this country be a leader. So much innovation happens here, and so many of the things in which other countries are now innovating started here. It's always been the case that the US tends to innovate in sectors and then lose them after a while and move on to the next thing. But at this point, it's not clear that we'll be in the frontier of a lot of these sectors for much longer.

So we want to revive manufacturing, but the right kind—advanced manufacturing?

The notion that we should be assembling iPhones in the United States, which Trump wants, is insane. Nobody wants to do that work. It's horrible, tedious work. It pays very, very little. And if we actually did it here, it would make the iPhones 20% more expensive or more. Apple may very well decide to pay a 25% tariff rather than make the phones here. If Foxconn started doing iPhone assembly here, people would not be lining up for that job.

But at the same time, we do need new people coming into manufacturing.

But not that manufacturing. Not tedious, mind-numbing, eyestrain-inducing assembly.

We need them to do high-tech work. Manufacturing is a skilled activity. We need to build airplanes better. That takes a ton of expertise. Assembling iPhones does not.

What are your top priorities to head off China shock 2.0?

I would choose sectors that are important, and I would invest in them. I don't think that tariffs are never justified, or industrial policies are never justified. I just don't think protecting phone assembly is smart industrial policy. We really need to improve our ability to make semiconductors. I think that's important. We need to remain competitive in the automobile sector—that's important. We need to improve aviation and drones. That's important. We need to invest in fusion power. That's important. We need to adopt robotics at scale and improve in that sector. That's important. I could come up with 15 things where I think public money is justified, and I would be willing to tolerate protections for those sectors.

What are the lasting lessons of the China shock and the opening up of global trade in the 2000s?

We did it too fast. We didn't do enough to support people, and we pretended it wasn't going on.

When we started the China shock research back around 2011, we really didn't know what we'd find, and so we were as surprised as anyone. But the work has changed our own way of thinking and, I think, has been constructive—not because it has caused everyone to do the right thing, but it at least caused people to start asking the right questions.

What do the findings tell us about China shock 2.0?

I think the US is handling that challenge badly. The problem is much more serious this time around. The truth is, we have a sense of what the threats are. And yet we're not seemingly responding in a very constructive way. Although we now know how seriously we should take this, the problem is that it doesn't seem to be generating very serious policy responses. We're generating a lot of policy responses—they're just not serious ones. 

The defense tech startup Epirus has developed a cutting-edge, cost-efficient drone zapper that's sparking the interest of the US military. Now the company has to deliver.

In Nebraska, a publicly owned utility deftly tackles the challenges of delivering on reliability, affordability, and sustainability.

Apple is famously strict about discounts, and it rarely offers price drops even on the most affordable products. If you have to buy an AirTag, you'll usually pay $29 each on Apple's website.

But this Prime Day, the prices are to be believed: a 4-pack of Apple AirTags for $67, which works out at about $16 an AirTag. To put it into perspective, four AirTags from Apple would run you $116 so this Prime Day discount is essentially… half price. The deal is only being offered to Prime members but if you aren't a member, you can just opt for the free 30-day trial in order to get access. If you don't need more than one, you can purchase the individual AirTag from Amazon for $22 rather than the normal price of $29.

If you want an easy way of keeping tabs on your most valuable items, Apple's AirTag is a great choice. The AirTag is designed to help you find your keys, wallet, purses, backpack, or whatever you want to keep tabs on. It's as simple to pair an AirTag as it is to say: just bring it close to your iPhone or iPad and a one-touch setup will link it to your Apple ID immediately. You can then use the Find My app to locate your item at any time.

The AirTag leverages Apple's massive Find My network and uses hundreds of millions of Apple devices to help you find lost things. When your AirTag is out of Bluetooth range, it can still be tracked by nearby Apple devices with communication encrypted and anonymous to maintain your information security. Your location data will never be transferred or stored on the AirTag itself.

Precision Finding is another major advantage: It uses Ultra Wideband technology to take you directly to your lost item with compatible iPhone models. To find your keys throughout the house, you can make a sound from the internal speaker in the AirTag or ask Siri. If you've lost something in an airport or a coffee shop, you can put the AirTag in Lost Mode to receive a notification the instant it gets detected by another device on the Find My network.

The AirTag is meant to last with a replaceable battery that still works after over a year and an IP67 rating for water and dust protection. That is, you can forget about rain, spills, or everyday bumps and drops. It's very small and light so you can stick it in a wallet, attach it to your keys or stash it in your bag without it adding bulk.

At $67 for a 4-pack, this Prime Day deal is the best opportunity you'll find to upgrade (better than during Black Friday) your tracking game.

The power station is also solar panel compatible with Jackery and allows you to recharge off the grid and increase your grid independence.

What's more, the Explorer 1000 uses a LiFePO4 battery which is known for its long lifespan and safety: This battery can maintain over 70% of its original capacity even after 4,000 charge cycles which translates to more than 10 years of reliable use.

The Jackery Explorer 1000 offers eight output options to meet your needs: Two USB-C, one USB-A, one DC car port and three pure sine wave AC outlets are available to charge and power devices at the same time. There is also fast PD 100W USB-C laptop and other power-hungry device charging along with LED lights built into the case for a little extra convenience in dark environments.

Priced at $448 for Prime members, this is the all-time low that it has ever been on Amazon. Make sure you don't miss it.

As details about his new political venture begin to emerge, Elon Musk has confirmed that the “America Party” will embrace Bitcoin, a move that solidifies the party's anti-establishment and tech-centric identity. The world's richest man made the revelation on his social media platform, X, signaling a potential new frontier for cryptocurrency in American politics.

The exchange unfolded after Musk positioned his new party as a home for centrists and voters disillusioned with the traditional two-party system. “Somehow being a centrist is now considered a radical, batshit crazy idea,” posted one X user on July 6. “How did we get here?”

Musk replied simply, “The America Party is the solution.”

This prompted a direct question from another user: “@elonmusk, will the America Party embrace Bitcoin?”

Musk's four-word answer was unambiguous: “Fiat is hopeless, so yes.”

Fiat is hopeless, so yes

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 7, 2025



His response, while brief, speaks volumes. By declaring fiat—government-issued currency like the U.S. dollar that is not backed by a physical commodity—as “hopeless,” Musk is aligning his political movement with the core philosophy of many cryptocurrency advocates who view digital currencies as a necessary check on government monetary policy and inflation.

While the tech mogul did not specify how his party would integrate Bitcoin, the most immediate application would be accepting political contributions in cryptocurrency. Under Federal Election Commission (FEC) guidelines, political committees are permitted to receive Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as “in-kind” contributions, which are valued at their market price at the time of donation.

This move is a natural fit for Musk, whose influence in the crypto space is undeniable. His electric vehicle company, Tesla, remains a significant corporate holder of Bitcoin, with its 11,509 BTC currently valued at approximately $1.25 billion, according to Bitcoin Treasuries. Though Tesla briefly accepted Bitcoin for vehicle purchases in 2021 before halting the practice due to environmental concerns, the company's sizable crypto treasury signals a long-term belief in its value.

Beyond Bitcoin, Musk is famously the biggest influencer of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogecoin. The price of Dogecoin often reacts dramatically to his posts, demonstrating his powerful effect on the volatile crypto markets.

Musk's announcement adds another layer of intrigue to his fledgling political party. Many questions still surround the “America Party,” from whether the controversial billionaire will complete the formal administrative procedures to who might run as candidates in the 2026 midterm elections. But by tethering its identity to Bitcoin, Musk is making a clear statement: his attempt to disrupt American politics will be powered by the disruptive potential of cryptocurrency.

Ukrainian Major General Vladyslav (Владислав Клочков) Klochkov says Russia is field-testing a deadly new drone that can use AI and thermal vision to think on its own, identifying targets without coordinates and bypassing most air defense systems. According to the senior military figure, inside you will find the Nvidia Jetson Orin, which has enabled the MS001 to become “an autonomous combat platform that sees, analyzes, decides, and strikes without external commands.”

With the Jetson Orin as its brain, the upgraded MS001 drone doesn't just follow prescribed coordinates, like some hyper-accurate doodle bug. It actually thinks. “It identifies targets, selects the highest-value one, adjusts its trajectory, and adapts to changes — even in the face of GPS jamming or target maneuvers,” says Klochkov. “This is not a loitering munition. It is a digital predator.”

Even worse, the MS001 is allegedly operating in coordinated drone groups, persisting in its maximum destructive purpose despite the best efforts of Ukraine's electronic warfare and other anti-drone systems.

Klochkov signs off his post by informing his LinkedIn followers that “We are not only fighting Russia. We are fighting inertia.” What he appears to wish for is an acceleration of Ukraine's own assault drone capabilities. The Major General seems particularly disappointed in the Ukrainian system of procurement rounds, slowing field-testing and deployment of improved responses to new Shahed drone generations.

Shahed drones are originally an Iranian design but have gained great notoriety due to their sustained use by the Russian army to attack Ukrainian targets. The MS001 is substantially upgraded in the ‘smarts' department thanks to Western/allies technologies.

Klochkov says the MS001 is powered by the following key technologies:



Western tech sanctions are supposed to neuter this kind of military threat from nations like Russia and Iran. This news indicates that such trade barriers are leaky, at best, and probably not taken seriously enough. ""Our Jetson Orin modules are consumer-grade products sold to students, developers, and startups for a wide range of beneficial applications,"" an Nvidia spokesperson told Tom's Hardware. ""They are not available in Russia and are not designed for military purposes. If we discover that any Jetson distributor is violating U.S. export controls, we will cut off their supply.""

This isn't the first Russian drone system that is thought to have adopted Nvidia's Jetson Orin as a key component.

A month ago, Ukraine's Defense Express site said that a new “smart suicide attack unmanned aerial vehicle with artificial intelligence,” dubbed the V2U, was powered by Nvidia's little AI computer.

While the Shahed MS001s use an Iranian design, the V2U looks like it is more reliant on Chinese tech, including the Chinese-made Leetop A603 carrier board.

Intel's next-generation Xeon processor, codenamed Diamond Rapids, will reportedly utilize a new platform with a 9324-pin LGA socket, indicating a revised memory subsystem and PCIe lane configuration. But a leaked slide published on Sunday by X86 is dead&back reveals that the new CPU could feature up to 192 high-performance cores as well as eight or 16 DDR5 memory channels. Please note that we are dealing with information from an unofficial source, so please take it with a grain of salt.

Intel's rumored specs for the Xeon 7 'Diamond Rapids' processor include up to 192 cores, an eight-channel or 16-channel memory subsystem, and a thermal design power of 500W. We already know that Intel's Diamond Rapids processors will use 2nd Generation MRDIMM memory modules, which will support data transfer rates higher than 8800 MT/s supported by existing Xeon 6 'Granite Rapids.' If these next-generation processors support 12,800 MT/s memory modules, the entire memory subsystem of these CPUs would support a peak bandwidth of over 1.6 TB/s, representing a significant increase compared to existing designs (approximately 844 GB/s for Granite Rapids).

Diamond Rapids 192 P cores 500w TDP48 cores per tile. pic.twitter.com/Bx9JYEtg0RJuly 6, 2025

If the slide accurately depicts Diamond Rapids, then the CPU will use up to six chiplets: up to four compute tiles (produced using Intel 18A fabrication process and packing up to 48 cores) and two I/O tiles that will control memory interfaces, PCIe 6.x lanes with or without CXL on top, UPI, and even additional PCIe 4.x lanes.

Intel's Diamond Rapids processors for data centers will use high-performance cores based on the Panther Cove microarchitecture. One of the peculiarities of this microarchitecture is the improved efficiency of AMX extensions, which will add support for FP8 and TF32 data formats.

The upcoming Xeon 7 'Diamond Rapids' processors will reportedly belong to the Oak Stream platform that will support one, two, or four sockets as well as PCIe Gen 6 interconnections. The CPUs will come in an LGA9324 package, which enables Intel to support up to 16 DDR5 memory channels and an unknown number of PCIe 6.x lanes as well as deliver up to 500W of power and considerably more at peaks. 

The slide says that Intel plans to release its Diamond Rapids processors in 2026. However, by now, Intel has not formally announced that the CPU has been taped in or powered on, which is a bit surprising. To that end, we can only wonder when in 2026 these processors will become available. 

Intel's Xeon 'Diamond Rapids' processor will have to compete against AMD's EPYC 'Venice' CPUs based on the Zen 6 architecture and featuring up to 256 cores.

In a US real-world analysis, only 51.5% of children with vitiligo received any treatment within 2 years of diagnosis, less often than adults.

This study showed that “48.5% of children with vitiligo remained treatment-free within 2 years post-diagnosis” and had a lower probability of starting treatment than adults, the authors wrote. Factors that might contribute to this difference, they added, included disease recognition, considering lack of access to pediatric dermatology care in some areas, and “insurance providers classifying vitiligo as a cosmetic rather than medical condition leading to limited coverage and access, particularly to newer therapies.”

This study was led by Serena Yun-Chen Tsai, MD, MMSc, Department of Dermatology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston. It was published online on July 2 in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.

This study relied on coded diagnoses and excluded patients with only one encounter, possibly inflating treatment rates. Disease severity, location, and care outside TriNetX sites were not captured.

The authors reported having no funding information. One author received funding from the Society for Pediatric Dermatology/Pediatric Dermatology Research Alliance. Two authors reported receiving advisory fees and having ties with Alys Pharmaceuticals, Avoro, Barinthus Bio NA, Cour Pharma, Incyte, Matchpoint Therapeutics, NexImmune, Vividion, and Sanofi.

Exertional heatstroke (EHS) is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention. Unlike classic heatstroke, which mostly affects older adults or people with underlying health issues, EHS can affect healthy, young, and athletic individuals, even at moderate temperatures. A recent review in Journal of Critical Care highlighted the importance of early recognition and rapid response, especially for intensive care doctors.

Unlike classic heatstroke, EHS can occur in young, healthy individuals and in temperate climates when heat production exceeds the body's ability to dissipate heat. Rising global temperatures and increased participation in endurance events are contributing to the growing incidence of EHS. Early recognition and rapid cooling are essential to prevent multiorgan failure and death. Whole body cold-water immersion is the gold standard treatment, and the principle of “cool first, transport second” is key to improving survival. In-hospital care focuses on continued cooling when necessary and managing complications, such as acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, liver dysfunction, and neurological impairment. It is a time-dependent condition that can rapidly progress to multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, with mortality rates reaching up to 26.5% if not promptly recognized and treated, the study stated.

The intensivist's role spans the entire survival chain, from providing expertise in prehospital care and initiating cooling strategies to managing ICU complications and planning long-term rehabilitation.

Even after the immediate crisis, the risk does not necessarily disappear. According to the authors, survivors sustain lasting cognitive and motor dysfunctions, with cerebellar syndromes predominating. Additionally, patients with severe EHS appear to have a significantly increased risk for cardiovascular events, possibly by myocardial degeneration.

EHS is not limited to extreme sports or tropical climates; it is a serious medical emergency that can affect anyone. Intensive care physicians must be prepared to recognize early warning signs, respond swiftly and consistently, and coordinate with prehospital care teams to save lives and minimize long-term damage.

As cases of EHS continue to rise, the authors emphasized that increased awareness and preparedness are critical to ensuring timely, effective treatment and better patient outcomes. This applies not only to medical professionals but also to organizers of major athletic activities and emergency response teams. Standardized procedures for on-site temperature measurements and cooling must be established.

Despite concerns about cognitive decline after cancer treatment, most breast cancer survivors show no increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, and some may have a slightly lower risk than their cancer-free peers, according to a large retrospective study from Korea.

However, any apparent protective effect faded with time, the investigators reported online in JAMA Network Open.

Overall, this is “reassuring news for cancer survivors,” Tim Ahles, PhD, a psychologist with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, who wasn't involved in the study, told Medscape Medical News.

“I get this question from patients a lot,” Ahles said. And based on these findings, “it doesn't look like a history of breast cancer and breast cancer treatment increases your risk for Alzheimer's disease.”

Breast cancer survivors often report cancer-related cognitive impairment, such as difficulties with concentration and memory, both during and after cancer treatment. But evidence surrounding patients' risk for Alzheimer's disease is mixed. One large study based in Sweden, for instance, reported a 35% increased risk for Alzheimer's disease among patients diagnosed with breast cancer after the age of 65 years, but not among younger patients. A population-based study from Taiwan, however, found no increase in the risk for dementia overall compared with cancer-free individuals but did note a lower dementia risk in patients who had received tamoxifen.

To help clarify the evidence, investigators assessed Alzheimer's disease risk in a large cohort of patients and explored the association by treatment type, age, and important risk factors.

Using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database, the researchers matched 70,701 patients who underwent breast cancer surgery between 2010 and 2016 with 180,360 cancer-free control individuals.

The mean age of breast cancer survivors was 53.1 years. Overall, 72% received radiotherapy. Cyclophosphamide (57%) and anthracycline (50%) were the most commonly used chemotherapies, and tamoxifen (47%) and aromatase inhibitors (30%) were the most commonly used endocrine therapies.

The primary outcome of this study was the incidence of newly diagnosed Alzheimer's disease, which was defined on the basis of at least one prescription for medications to manage dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, or memantine).

During a median follow-up of about 7 years, 1229 newly diagnosed Alzheimer's disease cases were detected in breast cancer survivors and 3430 cases in control individuals — incidence rates of 2.45 and 2.63 per 1000 person-years, respectively.

This corresponded to an 8% lower risk for Alzheimer's disease in breast cancer survivors compared with cancer-free control individuals at 6 months (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.98). The association was especially notable in survivors older than 65 years (SHR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85-0.99).

Looking at individual treatment modalities, only radiation therapy was associated with significantly lower risk for Alzheimer's disease among breast cancer survivors (adjusted HR [aHR], 0.77).

Several risk factors were associated with a significantly higher risk for Alzheimer's disease: current smoker vs never or ex-smokers (aHR, 2.04), diabetes (aHR, 1.58), and chronic kidney disease (aHR, 3.11). Notably, alcohol use, physical activity level, and hypertension were not associated with Alzheimer's disease risk.

However, any potential protective effect may be short-lived. The reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease was no longer significant at 1 year (SHR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.87-1.01), 3 years (SHR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.90-1.05), or 5 years (SHR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.89-1.08).

Even so, breast cancer survivors can still feel reassured by the findings.

“Concerns about chemobrain and the long-term adverse effects of breast cancer treatment on cognition are common, but our findings suggest that this treatment does not directly lead to Alzheimer's disease,” wrote the authors, led by Su-Min Jeong, MD, with Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.

Ahles agreed. The general takeaway from this study is that there is “no strong evidence that the cancer treatment is going to increase your risk for developing Alzheimer's,” Ahles said. When patients ask about the risk for Alzheimer's disease, “I can say, ‘Here's yet another new study that supports the idea that there's no increased risk.'”

He cautioned, however, that the study doesn't address whether people with a genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's might develop it sooner due to cancer treatment.

“Does the cancer treatment increase your probability or nudge you along? The study doesn't answer that question,” Ahles said.

The study reported having no commercial funding. Jeong and Ahles reported having no relevant disclosures.

Periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) were found to be common in children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), with age and severity of OSA influencing its prevalence. In most cases, adenotonsillectomy effectively resolved PLMS.

“The potential clinical implications of our findings are the consideration of AT [adenotonsillectomy] for the initial management of children with OSA and elevated PLMI and counseling caregivers regarding the treatment of elevated PLMI,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Amor Niksic, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas. It was published online on June 07, 2025, in The Laryngoscope.

The retrospective study design limited data collection on sleep characteristics, patient symptoms, the impact of adenotonsillectomy on symptoms, and serum ferritin levels. Additionally, the small number of children who underwent polysomnography before and after adenotonsillectomy may have affected the detection of differences in subgroup analyses.

The authors reported receiving no specific funding for this work and reported having no conflicts of interest.

Analysis of 14,772,210 live births revealed that counties designated as maternity care deserts faced significantly higher maternal mortality rates than those with full access to care. Desert counties showed a 36% higher risk for maternal death and a 26% increased risk for pregnancy-related mortality.

“Maternity care deserts are associated with significantly higher rates of adverse maternal outcomes because limited access to skilled practitioners delays timely interventions during critical stages of pregnancy and childbirth,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Tetsuya Kawakita, MD, MS, from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Macon and Joan Brock Virginia Health Sciences at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. It was published online in Obstetrics & Gynecology.

Fatalities temporally linked to pregnancy, such as homicide, suicide, or drug overdose, were often coded as external causes on death certificates and may have been excluded from the CDC pregnancy-related mortality classification. The surge in mortality during the COVID pandemic may have accentuated existing disparities. The cross-sectional analysis precluded causal inferences regarding relationships between maternity care access and maternal outcomes. The definition of maternity care practitioners did not include family physicians who might have provided obstetric services in rural areas. Additionally, the maternity care access measure did not capture the intra-county spatial distribution of services, potentially masking access barriers in geographically extensive or sparsely populated rural counties.

This study received support from the Eastern Virginia Medical School Junior Clinical Investigator Program.

An additional dose of a pneumococcal vaccine, either 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) or 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20), for new care home residents upon entry could prevent a substantially higher proportion of invasive pneumococcal disease cases and deaths per dose than the single-dose schedule for 65-year-olds, with the PCV20 vaccine demonstrating greater effectiveness over the PPV23 vaccine.

""Protecting older adults, especially those in aged care facilities, from infectious diseases is necessary to reduce morbidity and mortality. Vaccination, including against pneumococcus, is an effective strategy to promote healthy ageing,"" the author of a commentary wrote.

This study was led by Fariyo Abdullahi, MSc, Immunisation and Vaccine Preventable Diseases, UK Health Security Agency, London, England. It was published online on July 01, 2025, in The Lancet Healthy Longevity.

The national dataset could not identify individuals in temporary or respite care, potentially leading to an undercount of care home residents. This study relied on invasive pneumococcal disease risk estimates from the older study, which may not have reflected current conditions in England. The NNV might be underestimated as frail residents are less likely to receive invasive investigations.

The Immunisation and Vaccine Preventable Diseases Division provided vaccine manufacturers with postmarketing surveillance reports on pneumococcal and meningococcal infections, with cost recovery charges applied.

While reported cases remain sporadic, an increasing number of publications are highlighting contact allergies associated with connected or wearable devices. Pierre Marcant, MD, dermatologist at Lille University Hospital (CHU de Lille) in Lille, France, addressed the issue at the recent Francophone Congress of Allergology.

Since the early 2020s, contact allergies have been reported in connection with wearable electronics such as headsets, earbuds, and smartwatches. Several publications specifically reference allergic reactions were linked to Apple devices. While not extremely common, these reactions have occurred frequently enough that Apple has published dedicated guidance on its website.

According to Marcant, these allergies can present in unusual ways — for example, leukoderma linked to a nickel allergy from a smartwatch. More severe reactions have also been documented. One patient developed acute facial eczema with an angioedema-like appearance after wearing headphones. This led to an emergency department visit, where the patient was mistakenly treated with icatibant under the assumption of bradykinin-induced angioedema.

From an allergology perspective, the main allergens include nickel, thiurams, and especially acrylates— commonly found in smartwatch components. Although Apple notes that the Apple Watch and its bands are designed so that acrylate- and methacrylate-containing components do not directly contact the skin, reactions have still been reported.

Additional cases involve Apple AirPods, with other unexpected allergens such as gold also implicated. In some instances, chemical analysis is required to confirm the presence of substances like octylisothiazolinone, as documented in recent headphone-related reactions.

Contact allergies to connected devices are not limited to end users. A number of occupational cases have been reported, including among retail workers in Spain who handled adhesives while selling smartphone screen protectors. In those instances, the culprit was identified as 4-acryloylmorpholine.

Such devices are also widespread in healthcare environments, where patients may experience allergic reactions — most often due to acrylates. For example, skin reactions to electrodes used in transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation therapy are well-documented.

“These findings suggest that legislation should mandate labeling of noncosmetic consumer products to enhance user safety and transparency,” Marcant concluded.

Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) had approximately 20%-26% higher mortality rates following ischemic and nonischemic heart failure (HF) than those without diabetes, with similar patterns observed in both women and men.

“This [study] highlights the ongoing need to optimize the prevention and management strategies in the overall population of individuals with type 2 diabetes and HF to reduce the risk of premature mortality,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Kajal Panchal, MSc, Leicester Diabetes Centre, University of Leicester, Leicester, England, and was published online in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism.

This study relied on health records that were collected routinely, which may have introduced measurement errors for certain covariates. The lack of data on echocardiography prevented distinguishing between HF with preserved or reduced ejection fraction. Additionally, confounding variables, such as body fat distribution, dietary factors, and physical activity, were either unavailable or poorly recorded in the databases.

This study was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Applied Research Collaboration East Midlands. Some authors reported being supported by the funding agency and NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research Centre.

COMMENTARY

Dmitry Yaranov, MD

DISCLOSURES |  July 07, 2025  



This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Palpitations are one of the most common complaints when seen in the clinic, but a normal 12-lead EKG does not tell the full story. It captures just a few seconds. 

Your patient might still be having intermittent arrhythmias, like atrial fibrillation, premature ventricular contractions, or short runs of ventricular tachycardia, that simply do not show up during the visit.

What do we do? We start with a detailed history. Ask about when it happens, how long it lasts, what brings it on, and whether it comes with dizziness, chest pain, or near syncope. The pattern matters: regular vs irregular, brief or sustained, activity related or at rest. 

Then we monitor. A 24- to 48-hHolter is fine if symptoms are frequent. If they're rarer, think longer-term options like a 14-day patch monitor or even an event recorder. For concerning symptoms, an implantable loop recorder is still on the table. 

Next, we stratify risk. If symptoms happen with exertion or there is a history of heart disease,you want to refer to cardiology. Those patients need imaging and further workup. 

The bottom line is that a normal EKG does not rule out a real rhythm problem. If something feels off, trust your gut and dig deeper.

“Gold card” programs were supposed to make it easier for frustrated physicians to deal with insurers' burdensome prior authorization demands.

The idea: Insurers would reward doctors whose past prior authorization requests were typically approved by exempting them from red tape in the future.

At least 10 states have required insurers to establish gold card programs amid mounting concerns nationwide that overuse of prior authorization jeopardizes patient health. Last month, leading insurers joined with the White House in a voluntary pledge to reduce their use of the practice, which they contend is necessary to control costs and minimize unnecessary care.

But Texas' experience with gold card programs may signal the limits of that approach.

The Lone Star State was an early adopter, passing a 2021 law enabling health providers with a high prior authorization success rate to earn a “gold card” exemption from insurers.

But statewide, only 3% of providers met that bar, according to a testimony provided by the Texas Department of Insurance earlier this year.

“I think it's safe to say that the impact of this law on prior authorizations for our physicians is underwhelming,” said Ezequiel “Zeke” Silva III, MD, a San Antonio-based interventional radiologist who chairs the Texas Medical Association's Council on Legislation. “We would have hoped for a greater percentage of our physicians to have been granted the ‘gold card' status.”

At least nine other states have enacted gold card laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL).

Physicians maintain that excessive prior authorization paperwork impedes timely patient care, with clinicians and staffers devoting 13 hours weekly to documentation, according to a 2024 American Medical Association survey.

Insurers view the review as a guardrail against unnecessary care driving up costs. Studies show that restricting prior authorization could boost premiums by 5.6%-16.7%, a Texas Association of Health Plans official testified during the legislative session.

In June, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a revised version of the state's “gold card” law — part of an emerging national attempt to streamline the prior review process. Cigna, Humana, UnitedHealthcare, and other large insurers have voluntarily committed to reducing the scope of claims involved, according to the America's Health Insurance Plans trade group.

Meanwhile, federal officials have finalized requirements that direct some insurers, including Medicaid and Medicare Advantage programs, to speed up responses to prior authorization requests, among other measures. Some of those requirements begin in 2026.

As in other states, Texas' “gold card” legislation applies only to state-regulated insurers, which comprise about one fifth of the state's market. Under HB 3812, which takes effect on September 1, insurers will evaluate health providers based on a year of prior authorization requests rather than 6 months under the 2021 law.

To be evaluated, providers must have submitted at least five requests for a specific health service during that period. To achieve “gold card” status, insurers must approve at least 90% of requests, the same threshold as set by the 2021 law. But the new law stipulates that insurers review a broader pool of requests, including those made directly to the health plan as well as any related affiliates, according to the Texas Department of Insurance. 

The new law continues to limit exemptions only to “top-performing physicians” who repeatedly provide cost-effective care, said Blake Hutson, director of public affairs at the Texas Association of Health Plans. “Even with the change to 1 year, and the bill also adds in a broader array of claims that will be looked at, you still have to meet 90%.”

A key addition requires insurers to release an annual report detailing how many exemptions they have granted or denied, making decisions more transparent to the public, Silva said. “Not just what's being approved and what's not being approved, but to potentially evaluate for trends that presently we just have no ability to evaluate,” he said.

Gold card laws vary from state to state, and some exclude prescription drugs, according to an NCSL legislative summary. Other states with gold card programs include Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, New Mexico, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.

In Illinois, legislation passed last year targeted hospital services for Medicaid patients, as denial rates were routinely higher in that population, said Dave Gross, senior vice president of Government Relations and Communications at the Illinois Health and Hospital Association, Naperville, Illinois. “We're not seeing this problem in the commercial space,” he noted.

To some degree, the “gold card” concept makes intuitive sense, recognizing physicians who have a track record of getting their medical care requests approved, Ravi Gupta, MD, an assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, who has studied prior authorization patterns, said.

But Gupta raised equity concerns. Physicians in large medical groups and hospital systems will have access to staff and other resources to better navigate the prior approval process than those in smaller private practices.

Plus, he added, there's the potential that physicians who achieve exemptions may become “more indiscriminate” about the services that they recommend.

Insurers' stated aim is to reduce unnecessary and low-value medical care through prior authorization gatekeeping, Gupta said. But a study he helped conduct, assessing policies across five Medicare Advantage insurers, found a significant lack of consensus on what treatments should be included. Treatments comprising only 12% of Medicare spending would have required prior authorization by all five insurers. Most of that consensus, he wrote, “was devoted to a small number of costly services.”

The administrative burdens affect patients as well. Two thirds of patients with cancer in one 2023 study become personally involved, including calling the insurer or appealing a denial. The patients also reported less trust in insurers and the health system overall, which could have worrisome downstream effects, Fumiko Chino, MD, the study's lead author and an assistant professor of radiation oncology at Houston's MD Anderson Cancer Center, said.

“If you don't trust healthcare,” she said, “why on earth would you get a vaccine or get cancer screening or get your blood pressure checked?”

Gupta views the leading health insurers' pledge as encouraging in concept — but he notes that they are voluntary commitments without any accountability.

In the interim, gold carding remains no more than a workaround, he said.

“Gold cards aren't really fixing that [prior authorization] problem,” he said. “They're just rewarding certain clinicians who can demonstrate that they have been able to get through the prior authorization process successfully for X amount of time before they're rewarded with a gold card.”

In Illinois, regulators are still hashing out gold card rules, including whether the required 90% approval threshold will be based on a specific hospital service or a broader pool of services, Gross said. The hospital association also will closely watch whether Illinois' experience begins to mirror that in Texas, he said.

“We have some of the best hospitals in the country here in Chicago,” he said. “If we end up with a 3% approval rating of gold cards, we're going to have to go back to the legislature.”

Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) represents one category within the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV), alongside granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and eosinophilic GPA (EGPA). MPA is associated with distinct presentations, organ involvement, and worse prognosis than EGPA and GPA; treatment strategies must be customized according to disease severity, affected organs, and individual patient characteristics.

What do you know about the management of MPA? Check your knowledge with this quick quiz.

Although renal involvement is common in ANCA vasculitis owing to a high concentration of blood vessels, subtypes of ANCA vasculitis have distinct patterns of extrarenal involvement. These varying clinical presentations correlate with different antibody profiles: MPA commonly associates with myeloperoxidase (MPO) serology while GPA generally presents with proteinase 3 (PR3) serology. Following renal involvement, the pulmonary system is a commonly involved organ system in MPA; cutaneous involvement and neurologic manifestations are also common. MPA typically shows fewer manifestations in the ear, nose, and throat region and eyes than other subtypes. Cardiovascular system and gastrointestinal system involvement are more often seen in EGPA, though patients with MPA can experience cardiovascular and gastrointestinal symptoms.

Learn more about renal involvement in MPA.

The latest Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) guidelines recommend beginning plasma exchange in patients with MPA when serum creatinine rises above > 300 µmol/L (equivalent to 3.4 mg/dL, as stated by KDIGO). This is supported by a recent meta-analysis that reported plasma exchange reduces the risk for end-stage kidney disease at 12 months; the same serum creatinine level for initiation was recommended by the researchers. However, they noted that plasma exchange was not found to improve the combined endpoint of ""death and/or end-stage kidney disease.""

Additionally, KDIGO also recommends plasma exchange for patients requiring dialysis or those with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and hypoxemia, but EULAR specifically recommends against routine use of plasma exchange for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in patients with MPA and GPA.

Learn more about creatinine monitoring in MPA.

The latest KDIGO guidelines recommend considering discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy in patients with MPA who have remained on dialysis for 3 months without extrarenal disease manifestations. This approach acknowledges that patients with MPO-ANCA-associated vasculitis (which is most strongly associated with MPA) who have kidney failure without involvement of other organs face minimal relapse risk. Supporting this, the EULAR cites research demonstrating that patients who are dependent on dialysis and in remission without immunosuppression are significantly more likely to experience serious infectious or cardiovascular complications from continued treatment than suffer disease recurrence; they specifically recommend weighing benefits and harms in continuing immunosuppressive therapy in the MPA subtype of ANCA.

Learn more about immunosuppressive therapy in MPA.

According to a recent review citing data from KDIGO, patients with MPA typically have the worst kidney prognosis due to the chronic damage associated with this subtype. Further, patients with EGPA less often have kidney involvement than GPA or MPA and usually have better kidney prognosis. Kidney prognosis is generally worse in patients with MPA than those with GPA as well.

KDIGO also cites previously developed prognostic scoring systems (which include sclerotic, focal, crescentic, and mixed class), depending on most of the glomeruli histology. For example, focal class (> 50% normal glomeruli) is associated with a favorable outcome, while sclerotic class (≥ 50% sclerotic glomeruli) is associated with poorer outcomes.

Learn more about prognosis in MPA.

Both KDIGO and EULAR guidelines recommend a tapering schedule of 4-5 months after initiating glucocorticoids in patients with MPA, reaching a reduced dose (listed as "" 5 mg prednisolone equivalent"" per day) by that point. Tapering schedule is generally based on weight and disease severity. For example, for patients weighing > 75 kg (165 lb), EULAR suggests starting at 75 mg, then tapering to 40 mg by week 2, then lowering the dose by approximately 25% every 2 weeks until reaching 5 mg by week 19. This is the same tapering schedule recommended by KDIGO; the full tapering schedule for this weight and others can be found here.

Clinical evidence supporting this strategy comes from the PEXIVAS trial, which demonstrated that lowering steroid exposure by 40% during the initial 6 months maintained therapeutic effectiveness while significantly decreasing serious infection rates compared to conventional dosing. This accelerated reduction strategy effectively balances inflammatory control with minimizing steroid-related complications.

DISCLOSURES |  July 07, 2025  



Key updates in therapies for axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) from the 2025 European Congress of Rheumatology (EULAR) annual meeting are reported by Dr Philip Mease of Providence Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, Washington.

Dr Mease opens by reporting on 3-year data for bimekizumab in patients with active AxSpA. Results from the phase 3 BE MOBILE 1, 2, and an open-label extension study, BE MOVING, demonstrated sustained clinical responses for up to 3 years, in which 60% of patients achieved low disease activity. Additionally, a parallel study confirmed sustained improvements in patient-reported outcomes.

He then comments on the German RABBIT registry, which addresses the need to define difficult-to-manage (D2M) and treatment-refractory (TR) subgroups within AxSpA. Results demonstrated that D2M-AxSpA patients are often female, HLA-B27 negative, and have more peripheral symptoms, while TR-AxSpA patients are defined by active inflammation on MRI.

Next, Dr Mease highlights the Bechterew-App trial, which investigated the efficacy of Axia, a new digital therapeutic (DTx) for patients with AxSpA. The trial concluded that the DTx provided significant benefit in disease activity, functional status, and disease-specific quality of life in AxSpA patients whose pharmacotherapy was stable.

Finally, Dr Mease details a novel, highly selective immunotherapy targeting problematic T cells (TRBV9+) in AxSpA and celiac disease, suggesting a potential cell-therapy approach for AxSpA patients.

A 66-year-old man presented with generalised jaundice, significant weight loss, and epigastric pain. Diagnostic imaging, including ultrasound, CT, and MRI, revealed a periampullary duodenal diverticulum (PAD) compressing the distal common bile duct (CBD), leading to luminal dilatation without the presence of stones or malignancy.

A case report by Masome Aghaei Lasboo, MD, at the Department of Internal Medicine, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran, and colleagues, highlighted the diagnostic challenges of Lemmel syndrome, a condition frequently misdiagnosed due to its rarity and non-specific presentation.

The patient was admitted to the hospital with no significant medical history after experiencing ten days of intermittent fever, nausea, and vomiting two to three times daily, particularly after meals, along with general jaundice and abdominal pain.

Jaundice was first noted in the eyes and progressed to involve the face and body by day 5.

Four days prior to hospitalisation, the patient experienced colicky abdominal pain in the epigastric and right upper quadrant regions. Each episode lasted for 20-30 minutes.

Importantly, the pain did not worsen with eating, bowel movements, or changes in body position, suggesting a non-intestinal aetiology. He also reported significant weight loss over the past 6 months. Additional symptoms included nocturnal sweats, fatigue, generalised weakness, and anorexia. His medication, family, social, travel, and allergy histories were unremarkable.

On admission, the vital signs were pulse 85 beats/min, temperature 37.0 °C, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 95% on room air.

Abdominal examination revealed no palpable masses or areas of tenderness. Murphy's sign was negative. The liver span was approximately 10 cm. The patient had no history of gall bladder disease or alcohol use.

Laboratory results were as follows:

Serological tests for hepatitis C virus antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen, and anti-leptospira antibodies were negative.

An initial ultrasound of the bile ducts and liver showed that the CBD was nearly normal in diameter (5-7.6 mm), with no evidence of stones. The gall bladder had an average wall thickness and contained small amounts of sludge, but no stones were visualised. Follow-up imaging with CT and MRI revealed dilation of the middle and proximal segments of the CBD, measuring 11-12 mm in diameter. A 21-25 mm PAD was noted on the medial wall of the second part of the duodenum, compressing the distal CBD and leading to upstream bile duct dilation. The presence of gas and food particles within the diverticulum indicated mechanical obstruction.

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed to further evaluate the patient. It revealed gastroesophageal reflux disease, Los Angeles class B, mild antral gastritis, and bile reflux.

The second part of the duodenum showed normal mucosa without ulcerations or masses. These findings ruled out obstructive tumours or intrinsic duodenal lesions and supported the diagnosis of Lemmel syndrome, caused by extrinsic compression from the PAD. The patient was treated with intravenous fluids, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole during hospitalisation. After his pain, fever, and laboratory markers normalised, he was discharged after 23 days.

“Although Lemmel syndrome is rare, it remains an important differential diagnosis for obstructive jaundice, especially in the absence of gallstones or tumours. Early recognition and imaging-based diagnosis are critical to prevent complications such as cholangitis and pancreatitis,” the authors wrote.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has approved nogapendekin alfa inbakicept (Anktiva, ImmunityBio) for use in adults with carcinoma in situ (CIS) non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) that is unresponsive to Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). 

Approval applies to patients who are either ineligible for or decline cystectomy.

Inbakicept is administered in combination with BCG. It is not a replacement for BCG but acts as a complementary agent. The therapy enhances immune system activity by stimulating CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells, while avoiding the activation of regulatory T cells.

The approval was supported by data from the phase 2/3 QUILT-3.032 trial, which enrolled patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with CIS. 

The trial showed a complete response (CR) rate of 71%, with a median duration of 26.6 months. Among patients achieving CR, 58% maintained it for at least 12 months, and 40% remained disease-free at 24 months. Overall, 62% of patients with CIS achieved CR during treatment. The treatment also demonstrated a significant bladder-sparing effect, with a 90% probability of avoiding cystectomy in responders at 24 months.

Treatment involves direct instillation into the bladder via catheter. Patients receive weekly induction doses for 6 weeks, followed by maintenance doses at months 4, 7, 10, 13, and 19.

The most common adverse events were urinary in nature and included dysuria, haematuria, urinary frequency, and urinary tract infections. Most were mild to moderate in severity.

Dr Patrick Soon-Shiong, executive chairman and global chief scientific officer at ImmunityBio, said the therapy offers “a meaningful option for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC.”

The approval was granted through the International Recognition Procedure, with Serum Life Science Europe GmbH as the marketing authorisation holder.

Full prescribing information, including the Patient Information Leaflet and Summary of Product Characteristics, will be published on the MHRA website within 7 days of approval.

Healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report any adverse events through the Yellow Card scheme.

Macrophages are immune cells with a split personality: some fight tumors, while others help them grow. In breast cancer, most macrophages fall into the latter camp—dubbed M2-like—fueling tumor progression and dampening immune responses. This shift is influenced by the tumor microenvironment, where limited nutrients and oxygen force immune cells into a metabolic tug-of-war. One pathway under scrutiny is serine biosynthesis, regulated by the enzyme PHGDH. Though its role in metabolism is well documented, how PHGDH influences macrophage behavior has remained unclear. Due to these challenges, it is necessary to explore how metabolic signals shape immune cell identity and function in tumors.

A collaborative team from Sun Yat-sen University and Zhejiang Cancer Hospital published a new study (DOI: 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2024.0398) in Cancer Biology & Medicine, revealing that the metabolic enzyme PHGDH plays a surprising role in breast cancer immunity. Instead of staying confined to metabolic pathways, PHGDH translocates into the nucleus of macrophages, where it suppresses genes key to glutamine metabolism. By doing so, it steers immune cells away from an immunosuppressive state and toward tumor-fighting behavior. The findings spotlight a previously unknown function of PHGDH and point to new strategies for remodeling the tumor microenvironment.

The researchers began by profiling immune cell behavior and metabolism in breast cancer tissue and model systems. They found that PHGDH expression is diminished in tumor-associated macrophages, and that these cells show reduced activity in serine biosynthesis and glycolysis—two pathways essential for immune activation. Remarkably, PHGDH was observed relocating to the nucleus during macrophage polarization. There, it bound to the promoters of GLUD1 and GLS2, blocking their transcription by partnering with STAT3, a known transcription factor. This suppression reined in glutamine metabolism, a key fuel source for M2-type immunosuppressive macrophages.

To test function, the team manipulated PHGDH levels in both human and mouse macrophages. Inhibiting PHGDH amplified markers of M2-like behavior and immune checkpoint molecules like PD-L1, while restoring PHGDH tipped cells toward M1-like anti-tumor states. Mouse models showed that macrophages engineered to overexpress PHGDH slowed tumor growth and reduced cell proliferation. Further experiments revealed that glutamine supplementation or STAT3 inhibition could counteract PHGDH loss, reinforcing the regulatory loop between metabolism, transcription, and immune polarization.

This study turns our understanding of PHGDH on its head. We've long known PHGDH as a metabolic enzyme, but to find it functioning inside the nucleus, directly regulating immune behavior, was unexpected. It acts like a molecular switch—by repressing key genes, it redirects macrophages from supporting tumors to fighting them. That's a paradigm shift in how we think about metabolism and immunity.""

Dr. Zhenkun Na, senior author of the study

The discovery that nuclear PHGDH reprograms macrophages offers a compelling new therapeutic strategy. By targeting PHGDH or its downstream partners, it may be possible to rewire the immune landscape of tumors—turning so-called ""bad"" macrophages into allies of cancer treatment. These findings could enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapies, particularly in cancers resistant to checkpoint blockade. Moreover, PHGDH levels could serve as a biomarker to stratify patients or monitor treatment responses. As cancer research increasingly intersects with immunometabolism, PHGDH stands out as a key player in the next generation of precision oncology.

Diet may play a key role in maintaining vaginal health by shaping microbial composition through nutrient and metabolite interactions.

Study: Dietary habits and vaginal environment: can a beneficial impact be expected? Image Credit: Kateryna Kon / Shutterstock

In a recent article published in the journal Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology, researchers in Italy investigated the role of different dietary macronutrients in influencing the composition of vaginal microbiota in women of reproductive age.

They found that women who consumed more animal protein, particularly processed and red meat, and alcohol, displayed a shift towards less healthy vaginal microbial communities, whereas those who consumed more of certain plant-derived nutrients, specifically α-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid found in nuts and seeds), showed more protective bacterial profiles. Moreover, higher intake of total carbohydrates, vegetable proteins, fiber, and starch was negatively correlated with Gardnerella spp., suggesting these nutrients may help protect against vaginal dysbiosis.

Researchers proposed animal protein might negatively impact the vaginal environment through mechanisms like increased inflammation or the production of ammonia/sulfides during fermentation, potentially raising vaginal pH.

In reproductive-aged women, vaginal health is largely maintained by the presence of Lactobacillus species, which help prevent infections by inhibiting the growth of harmful microbes.

When Lactobacillus levels drop and anaerobic bacteria, such as Gardnerella and Prevotella, become dominant, a condition known as bacterial vaginosis (BV) can occur. BV is marked by shifts in vaginal metabolites and is linked to higher risks of sexually transmitted infections and complications during pregnancy.

Advances in gene sequencing have allowed researchers to classify vaginal microbial communities into five community state types (CSTs).

CSTs I, II, III, and V are dominated by different Lactobacillus species, with L. crispatus, L. gasseri, and L. jensenii considered protective. CST IV, in contrast, reflects a dysbiotic state associated with BV and is largely devoid of Lactobacillus.

Although several factors such as sexual behavior, stress, and hormones are known to influence vaginal microbiota, the role of diet, especially macronutrient intake, has been understudied.

Previous findings suggest that animal protein may increase the risk of BV, while higher fiber and carbohydrate intake could be protective. This study aims to elucidate the impact of dietary patterns on the vaginal microbial and metabolic environment in young women.

Plant-derived omega-3 (α-linolenic acid) might interact with vaginal lactobacilli, possibly being converted into other fatty acids within the vaginal ecosystem, contributing to its beneficial effects.

This cross-sectional study included 113 sexually active, non-pregnant women aged 19–30 from Italy. The goal was to determine associations between dietary patterns, microbiota composition, and vaginal metabolites.

Participants were excluded if they had used antibiotics in the past month, were menstruating at the time of sampling, had chronic illnesses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or urogenital infections, or had ever been pregnant. Health-related, lifestyle, and demographic information, including stress levels as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), was collected.

Each participant provided two self-collected vaginal samples during the late follicular phase. One was tested for sexually transmitted infections; the other was used for metabolomic analysis (1H-NMR spectroscopy) and microbiota profiling via 16S rRNA sequencing.

Microbial communities were classified into community state types (CSTs) using the VALENCIA tool, and Lactobacillus species were identified with high specificity using a custom reference database.

Dietary intake over the past year was assessed through a validated food frequency questionnaire with 188 food items grouped into 24 categories.

Nutritional data were processed and analyzed for alcohol, energy, and macronutrient intake, and macronutrient balances were examined using Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA), employing additive log-ratio transformations.

Statistical analyses included correlation studies, diversity indices, and multinomial logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders such as stress, contraceptive use, age, and body mass index (BMI).

Beneficial bacteria like L. crispatus were linked to specific protective compounds, including branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine) and the antioxidant 4-hydroxyphenyllactate, suggesting potential roles beyond just lactic acid production.

The study analyzed the vaginal microbiota and dietary intake of 113 healthy young women with a median age of 21 years.

Microbiota samples were categorized into CSTs, with CST I, II, and V dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus, CST III by L. iners (considered a 'transitional' species with fewer protective capabilities), and CST IV by bacteria associated with vaginal dysbiosis (such as Gardnerella and Prevotella). CST IV exhibited higher microbial diversity and lower abundance of L. crispatus.

Multinomial regression revealed that a higher balance of animal proteins (especially from processed and red meats) was significantly associated with CST IV, suggesting a potential link between dysbiosis and animal protein consumption.

Alcohol intake was also positively associated with CST IV and specifically correlated with higher levels of Gardnerella and Ureaplasma. Conversely, a greater intake of α-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid from plant sources, such as nuts and seeds) was negatively associated with CST III, suggesting a healthier L. crispatus-dominated environment. Moreover, higher intake of total carbohydrates, vegetable proteins, fiber, and starch was negatively correlated with Gardnerella spp., suggesting these nutrients may help protect against vaginal dysbiosis.

Correlation networks showed distinct relationships among bacteria, nutrients, and metabolites. For example, L. crispatus was positively associated with amino acids and beneficial metabolites (e.g., 4-hydroxyphenyllactate), while CST IV bacteria correlated with simple sugars (e.g., glucose) and alcohol intake.

No significant association was found between Mediterranean diet adherence (as measured by the MEDI-LITE score) and microbiota composition.

Bacterial taxa are depicted as red circles, metabolites as cyan squares and macronutrients as green diamonds. Edges thickness is proportional to the correlation coefficient. Only significant (p<0.05) correlations are represented. Bacteria, metabolites and macronutrients are clustered according to the indicator species analysis over the three CST groups considered.

This study highlights associations between dietary macronutrient intake and vaginal microbiota composition.

Higher animal protein and alcohol intake were linked with CST IV, indicative of vaginal dysbiosis, while α-linolenic acid intake favored CSTs dominated by beneficial Lactobacillus species. Additionally, carbohydrates, vegetable proteins, fiber, and starch demonstrated protective effects against dysbiosis-associated bacteria. These findings suggest diet may influence vaginal microbial balance through immune modulation, pH alteration, and bacterial translocation via the gut-vagina axis.

Strengths include comprehensive dietary assessment, detailed microbiota and metabolite profiling, and use of advanced compositional data analysis (CoDA). However, the cross-sectional design limits causal inference, and the self-selected, highly educated young cohort reduces the generalizability of the findings. Residual confounding (e.g., physical activity, sexual behavior) may also exist.

Overall, this is the first study to explore the influence of nutrient balances on vaginal microbiota using CoDA methods.

Results support the concept of a gut-vagina axis and suggest that reducing animal protein and alcohol consumption, while increasing omega-3 intake and incorporating more carbohydrates, vegetable proteins, fiber, and starch, may promote vaginal health. Future longitudinal and experimental studies are needed to confirm causality and underlying mechanisms.

Immune checkpoint pathways regulate T cell function and play pivotal roles in the treatment of both cancer and autoimmune diseases. One key component of these pathways is Lymphocyte Activation Gene 3 (LAG-3)-a classical immunosuppressive receptor that has long posed unresolved questions regarding its biological mechanisms.

In a new study published on June 30 in Cell, researchers from the Institute of Biophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Grossman School of Medicine at New York University, and the School of Medicine at Zhejiang University have systematically demonstrated that LAG-3 inhibits T cell activity by positioning itself in close proximity to the T cell receptor (TCR) complex, rather than by simply binding to a ligand.

This study is the first to systematically reveal the conditional activation mechanism of the inhibitory receptor LAG-3, which is regulated by its classical ligand, Major Histocompatibility Complex class II (MHC-II). Instead of functioning through simple ligand binding, LAG-3 depends on MHC-II-mediated spatial proximity to the T cell receptor (TCR), enabling cis co-localization with the TCR complex and subsequent phase separation, thereby effectively suppressing CD4+ T cells.

This discovery challenges the traditional understanding of immune checkpoint activation mechanisms, particularly that of LAG-3. The strong dependence of LAG-3 on spatial and contextual activation suggests that it is not easily triggered in vivo. However, this very feature presents a unique opportunity for the precise modulation of autoreactive T cells in autoimmune diseases.

Based on this mechanism, the researchers developed an innovative bispecific T cell silencer (BiTS) antibody that simultaneously targets LAG-3 and TCR. This antibody selectively regulates pathogenic T cells expressing LAG-3 and shows significant therapeutic efficacy in multiple autoimmune disease animal models.

The study introduces the concept of ""cis-proximity-dependent immune checkpoint,"" highlighting that LAG-3 does not function as a conventional receptor reliant solely on ligand engagement. Instead, its activity is tightly controlled by its spatial proximity to the TCR within the immune synapse.

This conditional mechanism helps explain the limited efficacy of LAG-3 monotherapies in cancer treatment, while also providing a rationale for its potential use in treating autoimmune diseases.

The researchers further propose a novel therapeutic strategy of ""cis-inhibitory bispecific antibodies"" for autoimmune treatment. This strategy has great potential to drive the development of next-generation precision immunotherapies that target pathogenic T cells, opening new avenues in autoimmune disease intervention.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","UCLA Health researchers discover four pathways leading to Alzheimer's disease","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250707/UCLA-Health-researchers-discover-four-pathways-leading-to-Alzheimere28099s-disease.aspx","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 12:18:00 GMT","

UCLA Health researchers have identified four distinct pathways that lead to Alzheimer's disease by analyzing electronic health records, offering new insights into how the condition develops over time rather than from isolated risk factors.

The study, published in the journal eBioMedicine, examined longitudinal health data from nearly 25,000 patients in the University of California Health Data Warehouse and validated findings in the nationally diverse All of Us Research Program. Unlike previous research that focused on individual risk factors, the UCLA analysis mapped sequential diagnostic patterns that revealed how conditions progress step-by-step toward Alzheimer's disease.

We found that multi-step trajectories can indicate greater risk factors for Alzheimer's disease than single conditions. Understanding these pathways could fundamentally change how we approach early detection and prevention.""

Mingzhou Fu, first author, medical informatics pre-doctoral student at UCLA

The research identified four major trajectory clusters:

- Mental health pathway: Psychiatric conditions leading to cognitive decline

- Encephalopathy pathway: Brain dysfunction conditions that escalate over time 

- Mild cognitive impairment pathway: Gradual cognitive decline progression

- Vascular disease pathway: Cardiovascular conditions that contribute to dementia risk

Each pathway showed distinct demographic and clinical characteristics, suggesting that different populations may be vulnerable to different progression routes.

The study found that approximately 26% of diagnostic progressions showed consistent directional ordering. For example, hypertension often preceded depressive episodes, which then increased Alzheimer's risk.

""Recognizing these sequential patterns rather than focusing on diagnoses in isolation may help clinicians improve Alzheimer's disease diagnosis,"" said lead author Dr. Timothy Chang, assistant professor in Neurology at UCLA Health.

When validated in an independent population, these multi-step trajectories predicted Alzheimer's disease risk more accurately than single diagnoses alone. This finding suggests that healthcare providers could use trajectory patterns for:

- Enhanced risk stratification: Identifying high-risk patients earlier in disease progression

- Targeted interventions: Interrupting harmful sequences before they advance

- Personalized prevention: Tailoring strategies based on individual pathway patterns

The validation in the All of Us Research Program - a diverse, nationally representative cohort - confirmed that these trajectory patterns apply across different populations and demographics.

The team analyzed 5,762 patients who contributed 6,794 unique Alzheimer's progression trajectories. Using advanced computational methods including dynamic time warping, machine learning clustering, and network analysis, researchers mapped the temporal relationships between diagnoses leading to Alzheimer's disease.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Growing popularity of contact sports raises concern over brain injuries in Africa","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250707/Growing-popularity-of-contact-sports-raises-concern-over-brain-injuries-in-Africa.aspx","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 13:50:00 GMT","

Contact sports are becoming increasingly popular in Africa, raising concern about the risk of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). This report highlights the urgent need for awareness, education, and research on CTE across the region. The authors propose a multifaceted approach that includes improving medical infrastructure, increasing funding, addressing sociocultural barriers to brain donation, and educating healthcare professionals. These efforts are essential to prevent serious long-term health consequences and prepare Africa for the growing challenge ahead.

Engaging in contact sports such as rugby, boxing, and American football often results in repeated head injuries, now recognized as the cause of a progressive neurodegenerative disease known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). CTE leads to neuronal damage that can cause memory loss, mood swings, and behavioral changes. Diagnosing CTE remains a major challenge, as symptoms may take years to appear. Raising community awareness and strengthening medical capacity are critical for timely diagnosis and effective treatment.

While medical professionals and sports communities in North America and Europe have begun addressing the risks of CTE, Africa continues to lag behind. In a recent letter to the editor, Dr. Abdulbasit Opeyemi Muili, a medical student at Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Nigeria, alongside colleagues from Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria and Moi University, Kenya, highlights the continent's significant research and awareness gap. Their work was published online in the Chinese Neurosurgical Journal on 1 February, 2025.

Calling to attention the urgent need for better awareness on CTE, Dr. Muili, notes, ""Without intervention, Africa is at risk of delayed diagnosis and inadequate treatment which plagued the USA in the early 2000s, potentially straining healthcare systems and affecting public health outcomes in the continent.""

The African community has long engaged in contact sports such as boxing and rugby. With the growing popularity of American football and the introduction of international coaching programs, the risk of head injuries among African youth is rising. Despite this, there are no recorded studies reporting the incidence or prevalence of CTE in Africa.

The lack of awareness on CTE is very concerning as the community and healthcare system appears unprepared and unequipped to face this challenge. Medical professionals are unfamiliar with CTE and it is likely to go unreported or confused with other mental health problems or dementia.

The authors highlight a significant research gap in CTE studies in Africa, pointing to the absence of large-scale epidemiological or clinical investigations. Even small-scale clinical case reports are rare, leaving CTE an unrecognized and underreported threat in the region.

One of the key barriers to CTE research is the lack of necessary infrastructure for accurate diagnosis. Comprehensive neuropathological evaluation—essential for confirming CTE—requires specialized facilities and trained professionals, both of which are limited across much of Africa. In the absence of such resources, CTE cases are more likely to be misinterpreted or overlooked altogether. Compounding this issue is the limited availability of research funding, which discourages efforts to launch clinical trials or retrospective studies.

Cultural and religious resistance to post-mortem brain donation further hinders progress. Much of what is known about CTE today has come from the study of donated brains. However, in many African communities, including among the Zulu and Yoruba populations, brain donation remains a cultural taboo, limiting opportunities for pathological study.

The authors propose a multipronged approach to overcome the potential CTE 'crisis' in Africa. Improving on the existing medical curriculum to include the risk factors, symptoms, and disease pathology of CTE will ensure preparedness. Stressing on the importance of CTE education, Dr. Muili says, ""Proper awareness of the risk factors and symptoms of CTE will go a long way in sensitizing both people and health professionals to the disease and building the interest of prospective researchers in the area.""

The authors urge medical professionals and CTE researchers to actively engage with communities and religious leaders to sensitize them to the myths surrounding organ donation in general. They point out that local government should support CTE research by funding large-scale studies and recommend international collaborations to build local expertise.

Ultimately, the authors issue a 'wake-up call' to both African and global health communities: addressing the CTE research gap now is critical to avoiding future strain on Africa's healthcare systems and to improving long-term outcomes for athletes at risk.

New research reveals that excess weight is linked to an especially high risk of developing breast cancer in postmenopausal women with cardiovascular disease. The findings are published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society.

Although higher body mass index (BMI) is a known risk factor for breast cancer in postmenopausal women, it's unclear whether this risk differs among women with and without cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes. To investigate, a team led by Heinz Freisling, PhD, of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (the specialized cancer agency of the World Health Organization) analyzed data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) and UK Biobank on 168,547 postmenopausal women who did not have, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease when they agreed to participate.

After a median follow-up of 10.7 years in EPIC and 10.9 years in UK Biobank, 6,793 postmenopausal women developed breast cancer. In a pooled analysis of both studies, each 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI was associated with a 31% higher risk of breast cancer in women who developed cardiovascular disease during follow-up and a 13% higher risk in women without cardiovascular disease. The development of type 2 diabetes did not seem to affect breast cancer risk: women with or without type 2 diabetes had a similarly elevated breast cancer risk related to higher BMI.

The combination of overweight (BMI≥25 kg/m2) and cardiovascular disease was estimated to lead to 153 more cases of breast cancer per 100,000 people per year than expected.

The findings of this study could be used to inform risk-stratified breast cancer screening programs. This study should also inspire future research to include women with a history of cardiovascular diseases in weight loss trials for breast cancer prevention.""

Mosquito-borne diseases kill more than 700,000 people every year, according to the World Health Organization, and the mosquitos that spread the disease are difficult to control. Most species have developed resistance to all major classes of synthetic insecticides, many of which pose both environmental and health risks.

Biopesticides, derived from living organisms, may mitigate chemical insecticide resistance and offer an environmentally friendly way forward. This week in Applied and Environmental Microbiology, researchers report that bacterial isolates collected from the Mediterranean island of Crete act as insecticides against Culex pipiens molestus mosquitoes, which can transmit human pathogens such as West Nile Virus and Rift Valley Fever Virus. In lab tests, extracts containing metabolites produced by 3 of the isolates killed 100% of mosquito larvae within 24 hours of exposure. 

Those metabolites might guide the development of biopesticides with minimal ecological side effects, the researchers noted.

They degrade more quickly in the environment and therefore don't accumulate, and they often don't kill such a wide range of different insect species as chemical insecticides.""

George Dimopoulos, Ph.D., molecular entomologist and microbiologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB) in Crete

He co-led the new study, conducted in Crete, together with molecular biologist John Vontas, Ph.D., at the IMBB.

Dimopoulos' research focuses on mosquitoes that transmit human pathogens, and over the past 15 years his group has found microbes that produce metabolites that interfere with the pathogens that cause malaria and dengue, and some bacteria that can kill mosquitoes. More recently, they have been investigating mosquito-killing bacteria in the Mediterranean region as part of the MicroBioPest project, funded by the European Union.

For the new work, they collected 186 samples from 65 locations across Crete. The samples included topsoil, soil from around plant roots, plant tissues, water samples and dead insects. They then exposed C. pipiens molestus larvae to water solutions containing some of the most promising isolates found in the samples. More than 100 of the isolates killed all the mosquito larvae within 7 days, and 37 of those killed the larvae within 3 days. Those 37 isolates represented 20 genera, many of which have not previously been identified as potential biopesticides, said Dimopoulos. 

Further analyses showed that the rapid-acting bacteria killed the larvae not through infection but through the production of compounds like proteins and metabolites. This is promising, Dimopoulos noted, because it suggests that an insecticide based on these bacteria would not depend on the microbes staying alive. The findings have implications not only for controlling mosquitoes but also as safe biopesticides to use for controlling agricultural pests. 

The researchers have now begun studying the chemical nature of those insecticidal molecules more closely and identifying whether they are proteins or metabolites. They're also mapping out the spectrum of pesticidal activity demonstrated by the bacteria, including screening the isolates against other strains of pathogen-bearing mosquitoes and agricultural pest insects. 

Biopesticides often degrade quickly and require multiple applications, Dimopoulos said, and finding the right way to formulate and deliver the compounds will be a challenge in the future. The new study represents the discovery phase. 

""It's now entering the basic science phase to understand the molecules' chemical structures and modes of action, and then we'll shift to a more applied path, really aiming at prototype product development,"" he said. ""There is a major push toward developing ecologically friendly insecticides.""

The review introduces the molecular subtypes of breast cancer and outlines how altered amino acid metabolism supports tumor growth. It explores key amino acid pathways—including glutamine, serine, glycine, aspartate, arginine, and tryptophan—and their roles in energy production, redox homeostasis, biosynthesis, and immune modulation. It also highlights the involvement of specific transporters and enzymes, and discusses emerging clinical applications, such as metabolic imaging and personalized therapies based on metabolic dependencies.

Key points of the review include:

Amino acid metabolism is fundamentally linked to breast cancer subtype biology and therapeutic resistance. Different subtypes show distinct metabolic dependencies that can be exploited for targeted therapy. Transporters and metabolic enzymes represent promising drug targets, while imaging techniques and personalized strategies may enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment effectiveness. Understanding and manipulating these metabolic networks could pave the way for more effective, precision-based interventions in breast cancer care. The work entitled "" Amino Acid Metabolism in Breast Cancer: Pathogenic Drivers and Therapeutic Opportunities "" was published on Protein & Cell (published on Feb. 20, 2025).

By using a genetic technique developed at UT Southwestern Medical Center that forces cells to rid themselves of mitochondria, researchers are gaining new insights into the function of these critical organelles. Their findings, published in Cell, add to fundamental knowledge about the role of mitochondria in cells and evolution and could eventually lead to new treatments for patients with mitochondrial diseases such as Leigh syndrome and Kearns-Sayre syndrome, which can affect numerous organ systems.

Our new tool allows us to study how changes in mitochondrial abundance and the mitochondrial genome affect cells and organisms.""

Jun Wu, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Molecular Biology at UT Southwestern

Dr. Wu co-led the study with Daniel Schmitz, Ph.D., a former graduate student in the Wu Lab who is now a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Berkeley.

Mitochondria are organelles found in the cells of most eukaryotic organisms, including animals, plants, and fungi, whose cells contain a membrane-bound nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. They have their own genetic material, passed down exclusively through females of a species. Mitochondria are thought to have originated as prokaryotic cells – which lack membrane-bound organelles – and to have invaded ancestral eukaryotic cells and formed a symbiotic relationship with them.

Researchers have long known that these organelles serve as cells' powerhouses, generating the energetic molecule adenosine triphosphate that fuels all cellular operations. However, recent studies have shown mitochondria play direct roles in regulating cell death, differentiating stem cells into other cell types, transmitting molecular signals, aging, and developmental timing.

Although mitochondria appear to perform many of these roles through ""crosstalk"" with the DNA in a cell's nucleus, how they perform this function – and what happens if this crosstalk ceases – has been unknown.

To help answer these questions, Dr. Wu, Dr. Schmitz, and their colleagues took advantage of a pathway called mitophagy that cells normally use to dispose of old or damaged mitochondria. Using genetic engineering, the researchers forced cells to degrade all their mitochondria – a process known as ""enforced mitophagy.""

The researchers used this process on human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), a type of cell typically formed early in development that can differentiate into other cell types. Although this alteration caused the cells to stop dividing, the researchers unexpectedly found that the mitochondria-depleted cells could survive in petri dishes up to five days. They had similar results with different types of mouse stem cells and hPSCs harboring a pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutation, suggesting enforced mitophagy can be a viable tool for depleting mitochondria across species and cell types.

To determine how removing mitochondria affected the hPSCs, the researchers assessed nuclear gene expression. They found that 788 genes became less active and 1,696 became more active. An analysis of the affected genes showed the hPSCs appeared to retain their ability to form other cell types and that they could partially compensate for the lack of mitochondria, with proteins encoded by nuclear genes taking over energy production and certain other functions typically performed by the missing organelles.

Then the researchers, in an attempt to better understand crosstalk between mitochondria and the cell nucleus, fused hPSCs with pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) from humans' closest primate relatives – including chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, and orangutan. This formed ""composite"" cells with two nuclear genomes and two sets of mitochondria, one from each species. These composite cells selectively removed all non-human primate mitochondria, leaving behind only human mitochondria.

Next, using enforced mitophagy, the scientists created hPSCs devoid of human mitochondria and fused them to non-human primate PSCs, again creating cells carrying nuclear genomes from both species, but this time only non-human mitochondria. An analysis of composite cells containing either human or non-human mitochondria showed that the mitochondria were largely interchangeable despite millions of years of evolutionary separation, causing only subtle differences in gene expression within the composite nucleus.

Interestingly, the genes that differed in activity among cells harboring human and non-human mitochondria were mostly linked to brain development or neurological diseases. This raises the possibility that mitochondria may play a role in the brain differences between humans and our closest primate relatives. However, Dr. Wu said, more research – especially studies comparing neurons made from these composite PSCs – will be needed to better understand these differences.

Finally, the researchers studied how depleting mitochondria might affect development in whole organisms. They used a genetically encoded version of enforced mitophagy to reduce the amount of mitochondria in mouse embryos, then implanted them into surrogate mothers to develop. Embryos missing more than 65% of their mitochondria failed to implant in their surrogate's uterus. However, those missing about a third of their mitochondria experienced delayed development, catching up to normal mitochondrial numbers and a typical developmental timeline by 12.5 days after fertilization.

Together, the researchers say, these results serve as starting points for new lines of research into the different roles mitochondria play in cellular function, tissues and organ development, aging, and species evolution. They plan to use enforced mitophagy to continue studying these organelles in a variety of capacities.

A pairing of two experimental drugs inhibits tumor growth and blocks drug-induced resistance in ovarian cancer, according to a preclinical study led by Weill Cornell Medicine investigators. The research reveals a promising strategy against this hard-to-treat malignancy, and more generally demonstrates a powerful new approach for the identification of effective regimens to treat genetically diverse cancers.

Ovarian cancer is genetically diverse in the sense that it can be driven by mutations in many different genes. This complicates the standard strategy of developing drugs to target common driver mutations. In the study, published July 7 in Cell Reports Medicine, the researchers applied a new precision medicine approach focused not on individual mutations but instead on the activation of growth signaling pathways specific to ovarian tumor cells. Using this pathway level data, they identified a new combination treatment strategy that selectively targets ovarian tumor cells and reduces ovarian tumor growth in preclinical models.

We're excited by the potential of using this combination in ovarian cancer, and we think this approach will be useful to identify effective treatments against other cancers that don't contain highly recurrent targetable mutations.""

Dr. Benjamin Hopkins, study senior author, assistant professor of research in physiology and biophysics and member at the Englander Institute for Precision Medicine and the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine

The study's first author was Dr. Shalini Nath, a postdoctoral research associate at the Englander Institute.

According to the National Cancer Institute, nearly 250,000 women are living with ovarian cancer in the United States, and there are roughly 20,000 new cases each year. Standard treatment involves surgery to remove the ovaries followed by chemotherapy, but recurrence is common, and the five-year survival rate is only about 50%. In general, oncologists recognize that they need better treatment options.

Dr. Hopkins and his team analyzed existing datasets on ovarian tumor samples to show that, despite their diversity, the mutations underlying these cancers commonly lead to the hyperactivity of a cell-growth pathway called the MAPK pathway. Screening a set of drug compounds for growth-slowing effects in 32 different cell models of human cancers, they found that an experimental drug called rigosertib, which targets the MAPK pathway and is being tested against other cancer types, showed enhanced efficacy against ovarian cancer. Though rigosertib inhibits the MAPK pathway, the team's experiments showed that in ovarian tumor cells this has the effect of partially de-repressing the PI3K/mTOR pathway-a mechanism of treatment resistance.

The team therefore did a second round of screening, this time with combinations of rigosertib and different PI3K/mTOR inhibitors-the idea being to hit tumors more effectively by blocking both the MAPK and PI3K/mTOR pathways. They found that although rigosertib on its own outperforms standard platinum-based chemotherapy in preclinical models, combining it with an PI3K/mTOR inhibitor works even better.

Dr. Hopkins hopes that these results will spur drug developers' interest in this approach, which could include candidate drugs that that act like rigosertib but are more potent.

""We're also working to identify more of these tumor specific dependencies in ovarian cancer that could offer further options for second-line therapy-because currently there are no curative second-line therapies available for this cancer,"" he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Neural stem cell grafts show promise for myelin repair in multiple sclerosis","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250707/Neural-stem-cell-grafts-show-promise-for-myelin-repair-in-multiple-sclerosis.aspx","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 16:25:00 GMT","

A study led by Cambridge researchers has shed light on how neural stem cell grafts could help restore myelin in the central nervous system. The findings suggest that neural stem cell-based therapies hold promise as a potential treatment for chronic demyelinating disorders, particularly progressive multiple sclerosis.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the central nervous system, leading to the destruction of myelin, the protective sheath surrounding nerve fibres. This damage is a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults.

In the early stages of MS, certain cells possess the capacity to partially repair this damage by generating new myelin. However, this regenerative ability reduces significantly in the later, chronic progressive stage of the disease. This decline in repair contributes to further damage to neurons and increasing disability in individuals with progressive MS.

Despite advancements in treatments, current therapies mostly focus on managing symptoms but do not halt or reverse the damage and neurodegeneration caused. This shows the critical need for a more profound understanding of how MS progresses and to explore how stem cell technologies could help MS treatment.

The study, published in the journal Brain, was spearheaded by University of Cambridge scientist Dr. Luca Peruzzotti-Jametti and offers crucial insights into the potential of neural stem cell transplantation in pwPMS (progressive multiple sclerosis). While neural stem cell transplants present a promising avenue for repairing the damaged central nervous system, the limits of their capacity to repair are being investigated by researchers.

This study focused on using induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) in a mouse model to evaluate their ability to promote remyelination. The research showed, for the first time, that induced neural stem cells grafts can mature into oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for producing myelin. More importantly, the study provided evidence supporting the safety of human induced neural stem cell transplantation.

This research provides critical evidence that induced neural stem cell grafts can effectively turn into myelin-producing cells within the damaged central nervous system, suggesting a potential new way to treat progressive MS.""

Dr. Luca Peruzzotti-Jametti, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, study's first author

The research team is investigating the underlying mechanisms of MS in the central nervous system and exploring how neural stem cell-based treatments can influence neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory processes. The goal of this research is to see how these therapies may mitigate brain atrophy and slow the progression of MS.

""Our findings represent a significant step forward in understanding how stem cell therapies can be harnessed to combat chronic demyelinating disorders,"" said Stefano Pluchino, Clinical Professor of Regenerative Neuroimmunology at the Department of Clinical Neurosciences, the study's senior author. ""We are particularly excited about the potential to develop central nervous system directed therapies that not only manage symptoms but also address the underlying neurodegenerative processes in progressive MS.

""We've shown we can make new myelin with stem cells, and demonstrated it is possible to target lesions with grafts. This is a major step forward in the research towards directed therapies for chronic demyelinating disorders such as progressive multiple sclerosis.""

This compelling evidence demonstrating the ability of neural stem cell grafts to generate new myelin in vivo within laboratory animals exhibiting MS-like lesions carries significant implications for ongoing research and the development of clinical trials.

One group dedicated to developing innovative stem cell therapies for people with progressive MS is RESTORE, a collaborative European and US consortium which includes a number of leading scientists from Cambridge University including Prof. Pluchino & Dr. Peruzzotti-Jametti. Supported by the International Progressive MS Alliance - Experimental Medicine Development Award Scheme 2025, RESTORE's mission is to pioneer a groundbreaking efficacy clinical trial using neural stem cell-based therapy for progressive MS. A core focus of the group's approach is placing patients at the heart of research, actively involving and engaging people with MS to ensure that the work addresses their needs, values, and perspectives.

The success of this study will help support the RESTORE consortium in their goal of pursuing therapies for the benefit of patients with progressive MS, and shows that neural stem cell transplantation can lead to meaningful remyelination and improved neurological outcomes in patients. It is hoped this can potentially pave the way for more effective clinical trial designs and ultimately, a fully biological disease-modifying therapy.

""We will be working with our partner researchers worldwide across the RESTORE research consortium to directly put the findings of this study into further practice, and to explore the potential for a neural stem cell graft clinical trial in the future,"" said Professor Pluchino.

Dr Catherine Godbold, Senior Research Communications Manager at the MS Society, said: ""More than 150,000 people live with MS in the UK and it can be debilitating, exhausting and unpredictable. Neural stem cell therapy for MS is still in the very early stages of research, but these results with mice are invaluable. They help us understand how neural stem cells might one day be able to unlock desperately needed myelin-repair treatments. We're proud to have supported this study and hope it can bring us another step closer to stopping progression for everyone with MS."" 

This work received funding from the Medical Research Council, the Bascule Charitable Trust, the National MS Society, FISM - Fondazione Italiana Sclerosi Multipla, the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), and the UK MS Society Centre of Excellence.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Why is Trinity Rodman at Wimbledon? USWNT star in relationship with Ben Shelton","https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2025/07/07/why-is-trinity-rodman-at-wimbledon-ben-shelton-girlfriend/84480779007/","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 10:05:07 GMT","

American Ben Shelton secured a top in the final 16 at Wimbledon on Sunday, June 5 — and he made some headlines in the process.

Shelton, 22, became the youngest American man to make the final 16 at three majors in one season, dating back to Andy Roddick achieving the same feat in 2004. He has also won each of his three matches so far by straight sets.

The Florida native also shouted out his friends and family after his third-round win, which included another sports star in United States women's soccer star Trinity Rodman.

Now, the No. 10-ranked player in the world is looking for his first grand slam victory, with his furthest finish being the semifinals at the U.S. Open in 2023 and Australian Open in 2025.

Here's what to know of Shelton and Rodman's relationship, and why the U.S. soccer star is at Wimbledon cheering on Shelton:

Rodman, a forward for the Washington Spirit of the NWSL, has been at each of Shelton's Wimbledon matches. The two make quite the sports power couple.

The dynamic athletes went public with their relationship on March 18 after Shelton posted pictures to Instagram. Shelton even shouted out Rodman after his third-round win on July 5 over Marton Fucsovics.

""It's not just been me here, I have a great team. My parents are here, my girlfriend's here,"" Shelton said as the ESPN broadcast panned to Shelton's parents and Rodman in the stands.

Shelton also spoke with USA TODAY in April on his relationship with Rodman.

""She's great,"" he said. ""I think we're both very happy. And yeah, it's been cool getting to know her and spend time with her.""

Rodman is a 23-year-old soccer player who's one of the best scorers for the U.S. Women's National Team.

Rodman, the daughter of Basketball Hall of Famer Dennis Rodman, scored three goals at the 2024 Paris Olympics to help lead the United States to a gold medal. She was also the youngest person ever drafted to the NWSL (18 years old) after going No. 2 overall to the Washington Spirit in 2021.

The Guardian ranked Rodman the No. 5 player in the world in 2024, with fellow American forward Sophia Wilson at No. 3 on the list.

Rodman's signature moment of her young USWNT career came in the knockout round against Japan, when she sent the U.S. to the semifinals of the 2024 Paris Olympics after scoring an extra-time goal to win 1-0.

Rodman was initially enrolled to play soccer at Washington State but opted to forgo her college career to play professionally in the NWSL. Her brother, DJ Rodman, played basketball at Washington State and USC.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

The ""Futbol Americas"" crew debate what went wrong for the United States in its 2-1 loss to Mexico in the Gold Cup final. (1:46)

Edson Álvarez's second-half header gave Mexico a 2-1 win over the United States and a 10th Concacaf Gold Cup title in a frenetic final at Houston's NRG Stadium on Sunday night.

Chris Richards opened the scoring for the U.S. in the 4th minute with a brilliant header that deflected off the crossbar and just made it over the goal line, but Raúl Jiménez tied it up before halftime with a clinical left-footed finish past U.S. keeper Matthew Freese into the upper left corner.

After his goal, Jiménez paid tribute to Diogo Jota, his former teammate at Wolverhampton Wanderers who was killed along with his brother André Silva in a car crash Thursday.

With Mexico dominating possession and chances, Álvarez got on the end of a set piece and flicked the ball past Freese for the 2-1 lead. The goal was initially ruled out for offside, but after a video review the goal was given, sending the majority Mexico crowd into a frenzy.

Patrick Agyemang had a chance to tie the score two minutes into second-half stoppage time, but he didn't make good contact on his short-range shot that was blocked by goalkeeper Luis Malagón.

""We're disappointed obviously to not come away with a win,"" U.S. captain Tim Ream said.

Asked what was missing in the game for the U.S., Ream added: ""A little bit of calm in some moments. We started out really well and then, obviously, they get a spell in the game and the second part of that first half, just a little bit of that calmness when we won the ball to try to move them around a little bit more.""

Jiménez scored his 42nd international goal, third most in Mexican history, in the 27th minute to level the match. He burst past the defense and one-timed a pass from Marcel Ruiz, beating Freese from about 10 yards on a shot that might have nicked Ream.

""We came from behind and are leaving with the title,"" Jiménez said. ""It's great and really important to clinch the crown a summer before the World Cup. It's something we've been trying to do since the tournament began.""

A sellout crowd of 70,925 at NRG Stadium was about 70% pro-Mexico and booed U.S. players when they walked out for pregame warmups. Mexico dominated with 60% possession and had 12 corner kicks to none for the U.S.

This was the last competitive match for the U.S. and Mexico before co-hosting next year's World Cup with Canada.

U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino used the same starting lineup against Mexico as he had in the Americans' two previous knockout-round wins against Costa Rica and Guatemala.

Defending champion Mexico won its 10th Gold Cup title. The U.S. has won the Gold Cup seven times and Canada has lifted the trophy once. Sunday's game was the eighth meeting between Mexico and the U.S. in the final.

""I'm speechless. We spent 35 days in intense training, away from our families, with the intention of winning. There's certainly room for improvement, but we're leaving happy and with our feet firmly on the ground,"" midfielder Álvarez said. ""When they first disallowed the goal, it was crazy. It threw me off balance, but I was really happy to see that it was valid.""

Missing many of its regular starters because of injuries, vacation and the Club World Cup, the No. 16 U.S managed five wins over relatively weak opponents and reached its first Gold Cup final since 2021. The meeting with 17th-ranked Mexico will be the last competitive match for both nations before they co-host next year's World Cup along with Canada.

Pochettino used their absence to evaluate players who could push for starting jobs during the friendlies this fall and next spring, and Diego Luna, Agyemang and Freese emerged as contenders for World Cup roster spots.

HOUSTON — The objective of the U.S. men's national team on Sunday was to win a trophy. It would be against chief rival Mexico, a team featuring its top players and in front of a sellout crowd of 70,000 of mostly El Tri fans at NRG Stadium. 

They didn't get it. And now comes the hard part. 

But we'll get to that. Mexico claimed a 2-1 victory at Sunday's Concacaf Gold Cup final – even if it came with controversy. U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino contended that they should've been awarded a second-half penalty kick with the score still knotted at one. Still, Mexico thoroughly dominated the match. 

Despite the loss, this summer was a clear win for Pochettino and his shorthanded squad, one that was missing Christian Pulisic and about a dozen other regulars over the last five weeks. 

It also sends a clear message. Especially with the biggest test of them all looming – the 2026 World Cup on home soil in less than a year. 

""It has to translate right away, or I think Mauricio just probably won't call people in,"" said heart-and-soul U.S. midfielder Tyler Adams, one of just a handful of World Cup roster locks in this group along with fellow mainstays like Chris Richards, Malik Tillman and Tim Ream.

Entering this Gold Cup having lost four consecutive matches for the first time in nearly two decades, the USMNT reeled off five straight wins to reach Sunday's final. More importantly, they showed resilience, character and pride — qualities that have been missing all too often since the 2022 World Cup.

""I think we understand what the standard is now,"" Ream said. ""We understand what we need to do on and off the field. We understand what kind of culture is wanted from us. It took a little bit longer than it probably should have.""

Better late than never. The arrival of Pochettino, the highly regarded former Chelsea, Tottenham and PSG boss, was a shock to the system for a squad that was the second youngest at Qatar 2022. Most of the players had never had a national team coach other than Gregg Berhalter, who was fired after the Americans' dismal showing at last summer's U.S.-hosted Copa América.

Pochettino is old-school. He demands total commitment from every player, and he was shocked by both the USMNT's fourth-place finish at the Nations League finals in March and the fact that several players, most notably star man Pulisic, asked to skip this Gold Cup on the back of that failure.

With some of their European-based standouts missing, Pochettino selected an MLS-heavy roster. What they lacked in pedigree they made up for with hunger and desire. Some, like attacker Diego Luna, have now cemented their World Cup places, if not starting spots. But to succeed on the biggest stage in sports next summer, Pochettino will need all of his top guys present and fully bought-in. It's on them to prove that they are.

""There's a few non-negotiables from now on,"" said center back Richards, who scored the only U.S. goal on Sunday.

""When the guys come back into camp, I think these are some things that we have to hold each other accountable for, and hopefully moving forward, if we can add a little bit more quality to it as well, I think that we're going to be a really tough team to beat.""

Ahead of next year's big test, time isn't on this team's side. While the Americans will play 10 tune-up matches between now and their 2026 World Cup opener, all will come during short, 10-day, two-game FIFA windows.

They'll have to hit the ground running when they reconvene in September for a pair of exhibitions with South Korea and Japan. If the regulars aren't ready, the players behind them will be.

Young fullbacks Max Arfsten and Alex Freeman weren't perfect during the Gold Cup, but both improved tremendously. Sebastian Berhalter had a pair of key assists in the knockout stage. Luna was a revelation throughout, even if he was mostly held in check on Sunday.

""We are getting loads of experience for these guys,"" said Ream. ""I said it to a few of them the other day after the first knockout game: They're no longer inexperienced. They've taken everything on board for the past five weeks, and it's been impressive to see all of them adapt and learn on the fly and contribute in big ways.""

It wasn't just the youngsters, either. Ream, who'll turn 38 in September, won a starting job next to Richards and would be a starter if the World Cup began today. Tillman and midfielder Luca De La Torre enjoyed their longest run of USMNT games yet. With bigger names absent, they were also forced to take on bigger roles off the field.

""Chris Richards, for example, has stepped up in more of a vocal role in terms of leading, making sure guys are doing the right things, making sure guys are in the right positions,"" Ream said. ""Malik is another one. Quietest guy ever but leading by example.

""To unearth more of those within this group has been a really big positive and something that gives all of us a good foundation moving forward that can help anybody who comes into camp from here on out.""

Most of the Gold Cup absentees will be back. It's inevitable. But they'll only return on Pochettino's terms, and they'll find a stronger, more grizzled supporting cast when they do.

Meantime, the coach won't soon forget the guys who were there this summer, and who exceeded most pre-tourney expectations. That goes for everyone from Adams, the U.S. captain at the 2022 World Cup, to third-string keeper Chris Brady.

""At the end of the season, to be quite fair I was drained,"" said Adams, who plays for Bournemouth in England's Premier League. ""But mentally, I wanted to grind and be a role model for so many of the guys here, because I love playing for this team and this country.

""I told every single player after the game how proud I was — not just of the growth of every single individual, but as a team.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxsports.com', 'title': 'FOX Sports'}","soccer"

The ""Futbol Americas"" crew debate what went wrong for the United States in its 2-1 loss to Mexico in the Gold Cup final. (1:46)

HOUSTON -- As the final whistle blew at the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup final inside NRG Stadium, the United States men's national team looked deflated. They had just lost 2-1 to longtime rival Mexico, and the pro-El Tri crowd celebrated by serenading them with the song ""El Rey."" U.S. heads drooped. Shoulders slumped, and all that was left was to collect their runners-up medals. Defender Chris Richards, whose headed goal gave the U.S. an early lead, wanted no part of that ceremony, telling reporters he threw his medal away.

But as painful as the moment was, it didn't do justice to what took place over the past 40 days. Starting with the day this young U.S. team first opened training camp in Chicago, this was a side that showed impressive growth, moving past the humiliation of a 4-0 hammering at the hands of Switzerland to reach a Gold Cup final. When the tournament started, that had looked beyond their capabilities. The team experienced playing knockout games in front of hostile crowds and while the competition wasn't the most onerous, particularly in the group stage, the U.S. found ways to get results, and gained experience in the process.

Along the way, several players made significant strides. Center back Richards cemented his role in the starting XI, regardless of who else might be available. Others, like midfielders Diego Luna and Malik Tillman, continued their rise up the USMNT ladder. Then there were new arrivals such as goalkeeper Matt Freese, right back Alex Freeman and midfielder Sebastian Berhalter, who all made positive contributions to the U.S. effort.

Will all of these players be on next year's FIFA World Cup roster? Certainly not. But they'll need to be ready should the opportunity arise, and they've taken steps in that direction.

""I said to the boys in the locker room: giving ourselves the opportunity to play in the final was the most impressive part of this tournament,"" said midfielder Tyler Adams. ""It was a learning experience for every single person in this team.

""For some guys, it was the first time playing against Mexico, so to come down here and play in front of however many thousand fans ... The guys were resilient. We battled, and that's the most positive thing you can take away from it:  we battled. I'm happy with the effort from every single player.""

This isn't to say that their collective progress was linear, and Sunday's final was chock-full of difficult lessons. Finishing has to be clinical, and Luna will rue his first-half shot on goal that flew over the bar. Marking on set pieces needs to be touch-tight, and Patrick Agyemang needed to do better in challenging Johan Vásquez for the header that set up Edson Álvarez's game winner. Tillman delivered an uneven performance at an inopportune time.

Some players also got the full Concacaf experience of playing against Mexico in a venue full of El Tri fans, as well as the fickle nature of Concacaf refereeing. This included a missed handball in the box by Mexico defender Jorge Sánchez in the 66th minute, as well as a soft foul on Luna that was a prelude to Álvarez's goal. U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino called the non-call on the handball incident ""embarrassing.""

Richards added that Álvarez's goal, initially flagged for offside, shouldn't have stood. He said: ""I think the thing about Concacaf is that I feel like we're always one step behind with the refereeing. Homie palmed the ball like Shaq in the box. And then at the other end we had a block who was offside, and in any other league would've been called offside.

""But again, that's Concacaf for you. They hate us, and we just have to keep moving with it.""

USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino talks about a penalty not being issued after Mexico's Jorge Sánchez's apparent handball in the box.

All that said, Mexico were deserved winners. They had more of their first-choice players available, and it showed. The USMNT struggled to defend the near-post corners that Mexico threw at them, including the game winner. More critically, the longtime U.S. weakness when it comes to keeping possession was on display again. Playing out of the back was brutal to watch at times. Possession was given away cheaply. Some of that is down to the inexperience of the squad, but even some veterans weren't immune. The lessons never stop coming, no matter a player's age.

One question going forward is whether some of these young players who have taken positive steps at international level continue on that path, heeding the lessons the game is giving them. They'll need to be given a chance first, with September's international window the first opportunity. Veteran defender Tim Ream feels like this group is ready, but the onus is on them to move forward.

""I said it to a few of 'em the other day after the first knockout game, they're no longer inexperienced,"" Ream said. ""They've now experienced something, and they have to use that. They have to learn from it and understand what it takes to get a game over the line and they will. They've taken everything on board for the past five weeks and it's been impressive to see all of them adapt and learn on the fly really and contribute in big ways.""

There were lessons for Pochettino and the staff too. The Gold Cup was their first international tournament, and Pochettino now has a better idea of who can help and who can't. However, that will be an ongoing challenge.

September is a time when the likes of Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Timothy Weah and others should be available. But Pochettino didn't sound inclined to automatically bring them back, saying he would examine every player to see where they are at in terms of form, fitness and attitude. Nothing is guaranteed.

The biggest reason for Pochettino's reticence is the bond that was formed between these players and his staff over the course of those 40 days. It started with long days on the training field, and that morphed into a grit and desire within the team that Pochettino clearly values, which was absent during the Concacaf Nations League last March. Pochettino seemed to fall more in love with this group with each passing game. That isn't something he'll just cast aside. Adams, for one, doesn't think Pochettino is bluffing.

""I think [the attitude] has to translate right away, or I think Mauricio just probably won't call people in,"" Adams said. ""Because the culture that we have, it doesn't matter who you are. If it's guys here that played well, if it's guys coming back into the group, if you're coming back from injury, just whatever it is, the culture and the emotion is the first thing that he wants to see and I think that's going to lead to positive results.""

Some of the players in this squad will clearly be included in September, a group that will likely include Richards, Ream, midfielder Luca de la Torre, Luna and Tillman. So how might the attitude within the Gold Cup roster be transferred to the group that is named in September, which is bound to see some different faces?

""I think we understand what the standard is now,"" Ream said. ""We understand what we need to do on and off the field. We understand what kind of culture is wanted from us. It took a little bit longer than it probably should have, but guys are going to be coming in and out. This group will more than likely not be the same group, it won't be exactly the same again. And it's down to us players to kind of drive home the ideas that they want, the culture that they've created.""

Ream noted that a new generation of leaders is emerging, Richards among them. When September comes, they are the ones who will be counted on to deliver Pochettino's message.

""Empower them to speak up, empower them to make sure that they're doing the exact same things at their club that they would do here,"" Ream said. ""Make sure that if they are, whoever's in the next camp picks up where we left off. And again, it's not just created on the field. That's a lot of off-field stuff and I think that's been one of the biggest keys for us in this camp and bringing so many guys along. And yeah, it's just going to be down to everyone to make sure we drive that idea home.""

Will the ideas be received? They'll need to be for this team to move forward and reach its goal of going deep in next year's World Cup.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Following Real Madrid's win over Borussia Dortmund in the FIFA Club World Cup quarterfinals, there was instant hype surrounding the club's semifinal clash against PSG.

This is, after all, the first time Kylian Mbappe will ever face his former club PSG after leaving the club on a free transfer last summer.

The matchup was supposed to be all the more exciting given Mbappe's legal battles with Mbappe over €55 million unpaid salary case, which led to further cases of moral harassment and extortion.

However, in a significant development, Mbappe has withdrawn cases of moral harassment and extortion against PSG.

According to L'Équipe, the Real Madrid striker's lawyers officially dropped the complaint, which was originally filed on May 16.

This had prompted an official investigation by the Paris prosecutor's office, which opened a judicial inquiry on June 24 and assigned two investigating judges.

This decision marks a major de-escalation of the legal conflict between Mbappe and PSG. It appears the French superstar and his entourage want to focus solely on his career at Real Madrid and reduce legal tensions off the pitch.

However, Mbappé is maintaining his separate claim before the French court. He is still seeking to recover the €55 million in unpaid wages and bonuses from his final months with PSG.

In recent weeks, relations between Mbappe and PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi have calmed. The latter even wished Mbappe “the best at Real Madrid, from the bottom of my heart,” in a statement last month.

This could go a long way in easing tension between PSG and Mbappe ahead of the FIFA Club World Cup semifinal clash this week.","{'href': 'https://ca.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo'}","soccer"

Absolutely diabolical game.

Bayern Munich's much-anticipated clash against European champions PSG ended in a 2-0 loss for the Rekordmeister, following goals from Désiré Doué and Ousmane Dembélé. This means Bayern's journey in the inaugural edition of the new Club World Cup has come to an end. Here are some observations from the game. 

First and foremost. Jamal Musiala suffered what can only be described as an absolutely terrible injury to his ankle at the end of the first half, following an unnecessary, overplayed and slightly malicious tackle from Gianluigi Donnarumma at the edge of the field. In what marked the German starlet's first start following his injury in April, this is without a doubt extremely gutting. The injury looked very serious, and Musiala was stretchered off the pitch in agony. Even PSG players were horrified by the state of Musiala's leg/ankle area. There is no point speculating; the most fans can do is pray Bambi makes a speedy recovery.

Musiala deserved far better than to meet such a fate. Having skipped the Nations League to focus on getting completely ready for this tournament, getting injured in such a manner must be heartbreaking. Fans are finding it hard to imagine what Musiala must be going through, let alone what this might mean for his career. His tears and pain resonate with every Bayern fan in the world. Losing time at such a crucial stage in his career, a career so promising and bright, is an excruciating thought. Musiala's talent will be sorely missed — and here's to hoping he is alright.

It is difficult now to talk about a football game after Bayern's most important player suffered such a horrific injury. But we must.

Vincent Kompany set this team up to win from the very get-go. The lineup was perfect, and it was clear that this was the very moment Kompany was waiting for to play this XI. The game plan was even better — by upping the tempo and maintaining the game's intensity, Kompany managed to mask Bayern's insecurities and played on his strengths. Bayern's quick wing play, speedy buildup by bypassing the midfield entirely, and added focus on going forward were exactly what they needed in a game such as this. Bayern countering PSG relentlessly pressing them with equal pressure of their own was not only a joy to watch but also a brilliant way to face a technically superior team. For all the talk about Kompany's competence as a coach recently, he showed he knows what he is doing on the big stage.

That is, for the most part. It quickly became clear that Bayern do not have practice playing with such intensity or against teams of PSG's level. The lack of coordination became visible as the game progressed, and the dispossessions in crucial areas gave PSG clear chances on goal. 

The bigger issue was the extremely risky highline Bayern played. Watching Bayern's defence caught on the counter and scrambling behind lightning-fast PSG forwards became a running trend (pun intended), and that was down to the easily exploitable defensive set-up. Sure, it gave Bayern a much-needed boost in build-up, but it came with serious consequences defensively. In that aspect, PSG's tactics with a more fluid structure that was able to cover ground more effectively saw them maintain a solid defensive structure without compromising their chance-creation.

In the end, this is something for Kompany to build upon. There is a lot that can be done here, but it was also clear that this is a game the players aren't accustomed to playing.

It is almost every matchday that this complaint pops up: Bayern Munich simply weren't clinical enough. Bayern caught PSG off guard with their setup and were able to penetrate their box far more often, but they failed to capitalize. This came off the back of a fairly weak Michael Olise performance before he settled into the game, and a performance that reminded us why Kingsley Coman was a candidate for sale. Konrad Laimer made his fair share of blunders, and Harry Kane's missed header early on sent what was a surefire goal above the crossbar, a moment that captured his game in itself. The second half wasn't much better as Musiala's replacement (he didn't look very sharp himself!) Serge Gnabry was absolutely abysmal. Bayern had their moments to capitalize, and didn't take it.

PSG weren't far better in the first half. Bayern's pivot completely nullified the PSG midfield in the first half, courtesy of a fantastic game from Aleksandar Pavlović, forcing them to play through their wingers. PSG's wingers rose to the challenge and created clear chances for themselves in admirable fashion (admittedly due to lapses in judgement from Jonathan Tah & Co.), but fell short in front of the goal. 

This changed in the second half and PSG's opener showed that very adaptation that tipped the game in the Parisians' favour. João Neves had an early break following a dispossesion of Kane but slowed the pace of the attack, completed a quick one-two, allowing PSG players to occupy the box in their typical 2-3 formation while also allowing Bayern to regain structure. This allowed Neves a variety of options to pass to, and PSG were able to complete a sequence that looked rehearsed and perfected. Doué's incredible strike took Bayern's now-structured defense by surprise and sent Neuer the wrong way. By taking chances on the break in a more sustained manner, PSG were able to overcome their limitations and even allowed their midfield to ease back into the game. The same approach showed when they scored the second with just nine men, as Achraf Hakimi toyed with the Bayern defence and laid Dembélé up for a perfect finish. Fewer players, same idea. Sure, it does help that PSG has technically better forwards than Bayern. But maybe that is something for Bayern to work on over the summer. 

Manuel Neuer has been written off time and time again, and he continues to show why he is Bayern's #1. Enough cannot be said about his game today. He kept the German champions in the game countless times, saving the most even the most certain goals. Almost nothing got past him for the most part. Fantastic game, yet another hall of fame performance with some promising candidates for Save of the Tournament. 

Thomas Müller, unfortunately, played his final game for Bayern Munich today. This is far from the send-off he deserves, especially after everything that went down with Musiala. Yet he almost won a penalty in his cameo and saw the end to one of the most dramatic games in recent history. He couldn't leave without a bit of fun and drama. Müller, forever Bayern. Good luck to the Raumdeuter in his future endeavors. It is difficult to imagine FC Bayern without him.

Sorry, but it had to be said. And this is not because Bayern lost today.

The new Club World Cup is nothing more than FIFA's attempt to generate more money at the players' expense. This is a loss that resonates no more than any ordinary game. 

The tournament crams even more games into the footballing year, whose schedule becomes increasingly more packed every season. And the players are at serious risk. Playing all these games is one thing, but the conditions the players play in at this new tournament are nothing short of diabolical. Record temperatures, different cities scattered across a country on the other side of the world. Poor pitches, as today showed. Musiala's injury came as a result of poor pitch management, causing his leg to get lodged into the grass, which is why Gianluigi Donnarumma's tackle had the devastating impact that it did. And to no one's surprise, the same stadium today is booked for a Beyoncé concert the same week.

The loss? Bayern have lost their star player likely for an extended amount of time in a tournament that, as it stands today, has little footballing relevance. Musiala's injury is the worst part of the defeat. The Rekordmeister will look to react well to the transfer market, recoup, and strategize for the upcoming season.

The boys are back and they're lookin' for trouble...

According to former Bayern Munich player Rafinha during an appearance on SporTV (as captured by @iMiaSanMia), a group of “angry” Bayern Munich players “stormed” the Paris Saint-Germain locker room after the Club World Cup game between the teams on Saturday. 

The players wanted PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma to apologize to Jamal Musiala for the collision that resulted in a broken fibula, dislocated ankle, and ligament damage for the young star during Bayern Munich's 2-0 loss:

Rafinha reveals that angry Bayern players stormed PSG's dressing room after the game to ask Donnarumma to apologize to Musiala: “Bayern players are not bad losers. I know them very well. They were angry because they wanted Donnarumma to at least apologize, since they saw that the injury was serious. After the game, there were heated conversations in the dressing room. The players went to him [Donnarumma] in the PSG dressing room to ask him to apologize, they exchanged some strong words. They demanded that, like a ‘code of ethics', at least to apologize, even though he didn't do it on purpose.”

While no punches were thrown, it does seem like things were, indeed, heated. 

Bayern Munich star Jamal Musiala will be out for months and now the club could be on the lookout for some help. Will Vincent Kompany and Max Eberl looking to lean on internal options or take a gander out at the transfer market for the attacking midfield position? Things just got more difficult, especially when considering the team's No. 1 priority is at left-wing and a close No. 2 could be center-back. Let's talk about how it might all play out on this edition of the Bavarian Podcast Works Show. You can get the podcast on Patreon, Acast, Spotify, any leading podcast distributor, or below:

FIFA Club World Cup

For those unaware, FIFA has established its own Technical Study Group (TSG) to analyse the Club World Cup this summer.

Led by their chief of global football development, Arsene Wenger, the panel contains former players and coaches — with Esteban Cambiasso, Aliou Cisse, Tobin Heath, Jurgen Klinsmann, Roberto Martinez, Gilberto Silva and Pascal Zuberbuhler unpicking the key insights from each game.

Advertisement

A recent media release from the TSG saw the panel offer their views on the tournament at the midway stage, and the conclusions were rather… jarring in places.

“The competition is much tighter than expected. We wanted to create this Club World Cup to give the big clubs from all over the world the opportunity to come here,” said Wenger. “It looks like it's the start of something that will never stop again.”

Yes, it is FIFA's job to promote the success of the tournament — even if some of what they are saying comes across as downright propaganda. In mitigation, the competition has not been without its significant moments — with Inter Miami's 2-1 group-stage victory over Porto soon followed up by Botafogo's 1-0 win over European champions Paris Saint-Germain (though the French club did heavily rotate for the match).

The Brazilian sides have been particularly impressive this summer, with Flamengo seeing off Chelsea in the group stage, before Fluminense's last-16 win over Inter Milan and subsequent victory over Al Hilal further highlighting the fact that clubs from the biggest country in South America should not be underestimated.

The most notable triumph was Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal's last-16 victory over Manchester City, in a game that accrued the highest cumulative expected goals (xG) in the competition so far — with 47 shots to feast your eyes on across the 120-plus minutes.



Did Al Hilal deserve the victory? Yes. Does that make Simone Inzaghi's side a better team than Pep Guardiola's? Well, no — football does not work in a ladder system where rankings swap if one team beats another.

Does it make the Saudi Pro League better than the Premier League? Again, not quite — even if Cristiano Ronaldo's recent comments might have you believe it.

Al Hilal's celebrations were ultimately short-lived, after Renato Gaucho's Fluminense beat them 2-1 in the quarter-finals and in doing so became the only non-European team to make the last four of the tournament.

In some ways, this backs up FIFA's media release that states this summer's tournament has “shown that high-quality football is played all over the world”.

This is a sentiment shared by Real Madrid head coach Xabi Alonso. “The (Club) World Cup is showing us the high level of competition in other leagues,” Alonso said ahead of Madrid's quarter-final with Borussia Dortmund. “Maybe we Europeans are not so familiar with it. The Saudi, Brazilian and even the Argentinian leagues. Sometimes in Europe we are too ‘Championsised'”.

That is true to an extent. We should not ignore how good certain clubs are across global football, but what these isolated cases in a summer tournament can teach us about the quality of leagues across the world is another question altogether.

Do FIFA's conclusions live and die within the confines of the competition itself? Or can we extrapolate each team's performances as indicative of their league's strength?

As The Athletic has previously analysed, footballing inequality can exist within any country, such that the strength of the best teams does not always represent the competitiveness, or quality, of the entire league itself — think Celtic and Rangers in the Scottish Premiership.

Using data from Twenty First Group, a sports intelligence firm that advises clubs, leagues and investors, we can look at the spread in quality across selected leagues whose teams have reached the latter stages of the Club World Cup — and we have thrown MLS in there for good measure.

Twenty First Group's World Super League model uses a machine-learning algorithm to generate a single rating for every team in world football. League strength can then be calculated from the average rating of each team.

As you can see below, there is plenty of spread across each league, but some clubs separate themselves from the pack more than others.



The Brazilian league is an interesting case. “We currently rate Brazil's Serie A as the sixth-best league globally, so we expected the four Brazilian teams to be competitive pre-tournament,” said Twenty First Group's Senior Data Scientist, Aurel Nazmiu.

Crucially, it is not just the strength of the league but the compact distribution of teams within the Brazilian top flight that highlights the competitiveness of the division from top to bottom. As the strongest teams in the league, Palmeiras and Flamengo are not worlds apart from Juventude — the lowest-rated team.

This is made clear when comparing the “standard deviation” of team ratings across each league. This statistical term simply looks at the variability of a set of numbers. The larger the standard deviation, the more spread out the ratings are within the respective league.

Owing to the salary-cap system in the United States, MLS comes out with the lowest standard deviation and the highest competitiveness statistically. A close second is the Brazilian league, which can give us confidence that this summer's impressive performances by its four representatives at the tournament are proof of the quality of its league.

By contrast, the Saudi Pro League has the highest standard deviation across the division, with the riches of Al Hilal — and their fellow three clubs controlled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) — dwarfing others within the country.



“Although we rate the Saudi Pro League as the 50th-best league globally, Al Hilal are significantly better than the rest of the league at the moment — ranked 132nd in the world in our models,” Nazmiu says. “ For context, the second-best Saudi team, Al Ahli, are much lower at 279.”

Among the top 50 leagues worldwide, the Saudi Pro League is ranked as the fifth-most unequal in terms of quality.

Contrast Al Hilal's global ranking of 132nd — sandwiched between the Bundesliga's Union Berlin and Spain's Las Palmas — with the lowest-ranked team in the Saudi Pro League in 2024-25, Al Orobah, who come in at 2,405th in the world. Al Orobah finished 17th last season with an average attendance of 2,307, lower than the average at Barnet (2,315) in England's fifth tier in 2024-25.

So Al Hilal's success this summer does not yet prove that the quality of the entire Saudi Pro League is on the rise.

Of course, European football is not exempt from such inequality, with Paris Saint-Germain dominant in France and the Portuguese trio of Benfica, Porto and Sporting CP dominating their top flight. You could very easily throw Bayern Munich in Germany into that argument across a 10-year window.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino said that “a new era of football has definitely started” on social media after Al Hilal's victory over Manchester City last week — but is that an accurate declaration?

Yes, there has been some excellent football on show and some memorable support from die-hard fans who have made the journey from around the world. There has been drama, shocks, and some notable upsets.

However, to use this tournament as an advertisement for the increased competitiveness of the global game might just be a stretch too far.

Szymon Marciniak will be in charge of this game.

FIFA have appointed Polish referee Szymon Marciniak as the man in charge of Wednesday's match between Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain in the FIFA Club World Cup Semifinals, which will be played in New Jersey (21:00 CEST, 03:00pm EST).

Marciniak is the most experienced referee in European football and he's been in charge of many crucial games. He was the official in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and he also refereed Real Madrid's 1-0 win against Juventus in this current Club World Cup and the team's victory over Atletico de Madrid in the return leg of the Champions League's Round of 16. Real Madrid have a 6-2-3 record with the Polish referee in charge.

Marciniak will have his hands full in this game, as both teams will surely play with intensity and physicality given that they will be playing for a spot in the Final.

One year out from the FIFA World Cup 2026 hitting North American soil, the summer of 2025 is looking to be a monumental one for American soccer players and the U.S. men's national team. 

While several star European players sat out the USMNT's Gold Cup journey, others have taken it in stride and impressed in the team's run to the final, where they fell 2–1 to Mexico.

Yet, even those without the impressive summers under head coach Mauricio Pochettino could see a move shortly, as everyone looks to raise their level ahead of next year's World Cup. 

Already, Johnny Cardoso has moved from Real Betis to Atlético Madrid, but there could be more moves to come, and Sports Illustrated takes a look at a few of the players who could be lacing up for new clubs. 

Malik Tillman has been one of the impressive players for the USMNT at the Gold Cup and reportedly looks set to join 2024 Bundesliga champions Bayer Leverkusen, after spending three seasons with PSV Eindhoven in the Netherlands. 

The 23-year-old would return to Germany after coming through the Bayern Munich academy, but would do so as a much more polished player, having scored 25 goals and 19 assists in 73 appearances for the Dutch side and been capped 22 times by his country. 

At the same time, the reported fee of up to $41 million would make him the second most expensive American transfer, second only to Christian Pulisic's move from Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea in 2018-19, which totaled $73.1 million. 

Given he is a player on the rise and still relatively young, the hope for Leverkusen and former Manchester United head coach Erik ten Hag would be that he can step into the role left by Florian Wirtz's departure, after the 22-year-old left for Liverpool. 

Patrick Agyemang has carved himself out a key starting role with the USMNT at the Gold Cup and has proven to be one of the best young goal scorers in MLS with Charlotte FC. 

Now, he appears set to join English Championship side Derby County, in a move that will take him to Europe, but may not put him against a significantly higher level than he currently faces in MLS. 

However, MLS insider Tom Bogert reports that Derby County are splashing the cash to the tune of $8 million for the striker, a nice return for Charlotte FC after initially selecting Agyemang in the 2023 MLS SuperDraft. 

With Charlotte FC, Agyemang has 18 goals and six assists in 63 games, and has shown to be a versatile goalscorer, finding opportunities on crosses with his six-foot-four frame, and his speed and long stride allowing him to split defenses on long balls. 

Although he won the starting role and the eye of Pochettino this summer, making the move to the Championship puts him in a precarious position, where he will have to adapt quickly and maintain his form if he genuinely wants to challenge for a starting spot at next year's World Cup. 

One of the most recent call-ups for the USMNT, FC Köln striker Damion Downs appears set to join Premier League side Southampton, according to Sky Sports Germany's Florian Plettenberg. 

According to Plettenberg's report, the transfer fee would be $9.4 million, with potential add-ons which could see the package exceed $11.78 million, with a contract through 2029. 

Downs has not gotten many opportunities with the USMNT at the Gold Cup, his first competitive national team camp, but impressed in the 2. Bundesliga in 2024–25, netting 10 goals and five assists in 29 league games, helping his side return to the German top flight. 

While the Premier League is a big move for any 21-year-old, Downs's record could see him adapt, albeit likely at a slower pace, considering the step up from the German second division, where most of his success has come from. 

Still, even if it takes him a little while to find his feet in one of the world's best leagues, making to move at a young age will behoove the American striker, and some surprise form could see him crack the starting lineup for the USMNT over the next year. 

No move is inevitable, but Juventus look to be shopping Timothy Weah this summer, with reports that Nottingham Forest, Marseille, Leeds United, and AS Monaco are among clubs interested in the 24-year-old American. 

According to L'Equipe, the Old Lady could be enticed by a fee of at least $16.71 million for the winger, who scored five goals and two assists in 30 Serie A matches in 2024–25, but will hope to maintain a significant role at any club he moves to.

A recent media release from the TSG saw the panel offer their views on the tournament at the midway stage, and the conclusions were rather… jarring in places.

“The competition is much tighter than expected. We wanted to create this Club World Cup to give the big clubs from all over the world the opportunity to come here,” said Wenger. “It looks like it's the start of something that will never stop again.”

Yes, it is FIFA's job to promote the success of the tournament — even if some of what they are saying comes across as downright propaganda. In mitigation, the competition has not been without its significant moments — with Inter Miami's 2-1 group-stage victory over Porto soon followed up by Botafogo's 1-0 win over European champions Paris Saint-Germain (though the French club did heavily rotate for the match).

The Brazilian sides have been particularly impressive this summer, with Flamengo seeing off Chelsea in the group stage, before Fluminense's last-16 win over Inter Milan and subsequent victory over Al Hilal further highlighting the fact that clubs from the biggest country in South America should not be underestimated.

The most notable triumph was Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal's last-16 victory over Manchester City, in a game that accrued the highest cumulative expected goals (xG) in the competition so far — with 47 shots to feast your eyes on across the 120-plus minutes.



Did Al Hilal deserve the victory? Yes. Does that make Simone Inzaghi's side a better team than Pep Guardiola's? Well, no — football does not work in a ladder system where rankings swap if one team beats another.

Does it make the Saudi Pro League better than the Premier League? Again, not quite — even if Cristiano Ronaldo's recent comments might have you believe it.

Al Hilal's celebrations were ultimately short-lived, after Renato Gaucho's Fluminense beat them 2-1 in the quarter-finals and in doing so became the only non-European team to make the last four of the tournament.

In some ways, this backs up FIFA's media release that states this summer's tournament has “shown that high-quality football is played all over the world”.

This is a sentiment shared by Real Madrid head coach Xabi Alonso. “The (Club) World Cup is showing us the high level of competition in other leagues,” Alonso said ahead of Madrid's quarter-final with Borussia Dortmund. “Maybe we Europeans are not so familiar with it. The Saudi, Brazilian and even the Argentinian leagues. Sometimes in Europe we are too ‘Championsised'”.

That is true to an extent. We should not ignore how good certain clubs are across global football, but what these isolated cases in a summer tournament can teach us about the quality of leagues across the world is another question altogether.

Do FIFA's conclusions live and die within the confines of the competition itself? Or can we extrapolate each team's performances as indicative of their league's strength?

As The Athletic has previously analysed, footballing inequality can exist within any country, such that the strength of the best teams does not always represent the competitiveness, or quality, of the entire league itself — think Celtic and Rangers in the Scottish Premiership.

Using data from Twenty First Group, a sports intelligence firm that advises clubs, leagues and investors, we can look at the spread in quality across selected leagues whose teams have reached the latter stages of the Club World Cup — and we have thrown MLS in there for good measure.

Twenty First Group's World Super League model uses a machine-learning algorithm to generate a single rating for every team in world football. League strength can then be calculated from the average rating of each team.

As you can see below, there is plenty of spread across each league, but some clubs separate themselves from the pack more than others.



The Brazilian league is an interesting case. “We currently rate Brazil's Serie A as the sixth-best league globally, so we expected the four Brazilian teams to be competitive pre-tournament,” said Twenty First Group's Senior Data Scientist, Aurel Nazmiu.

Crucially, it is not just the strength of the league but the compact distribution of teams within the Brazilian top flight that highlights the competitiveness of the division from top to bottom. As the strongest teams in the league, Palmeiras and Flamengo are not worlds apart from Juventude — the lowest-rated team.

This is made clear when comparing the “standard deviation” of team ratings across each league. This statistical term simply looks at the variability of a set of numbers. The larger the standard deviation, the more spread out the ratings are within the respective league.

Owing to the salary-cap system in the United States, MLS comes out with the lowest standard deviation and the highest competitiveness statistically. A close second is the Brazilian league, which can give us confidence that this summer's impressive performances by its four representatives at the tournament are proof of the quality of its league.

By contrast, the Saudi Pro League has the highest standard deviation across the division, with the riches of Al Hilal — and their fellow three clubs controlled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) — dwarfing others within the country.



“Although we rate the Saudi Pro League as the 50th-best league globally, Al Hilal are significantly better than the rest of the league at the moment — ranked 132nd in the world in our models,” Nazmiu says. “ For context, the second-best Saudi team, Al Ahli, are much lower at 279.”

Among the top 50 leagues worldwide, the Saudi Pro League is ranked as the fifth-most unequal in terms of quality.

Contrast Al Hilal's global ranking of 132nd — sandwiched between the Bundesliga's Union Berlin and Spain's Las Palmas — with the lowest-ranked team in the Saudi Pro League in 2024-25, Al Orobah, who come in at 2,405th in the world. Al Orobah finished 17th last season with an average attendance of 2,307, lower than the average at Barnet (2,315) in England's fifth tier in 2024-25.

So Al Hilal's success this summer does not yet prove that the quality of the entire Saudi Pro League is on the rise.

Of course, European football is not exempt from such inequality, with Paris Saint-Germain dominant in France and the Portuguese trio of Benfica, Porto and Sporting CP dominating their top flight. You could very easily throw Bayern Munich in Germany into that argument across a 10-year window.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino said that “a new era of football has definitely started” on social media after Al Hilal's victory over Manchester City last week — but is that an accurate declaration?

Yes, there has been some excellent football on show and some memorable support from die-hard fans who have made the journey from around the world. There has been drama, shocks, and some notable upsets.

However, to use this tournament as an advertisement for the increased competitiveness of the global game might just be a stretch too far.

Szymon Marciniak will be in charge of this game.

FIFA have appointed Polish referee Szymon Marciniak as the man in charge of Wednesday's match between Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain in the FIFA Club World Cup Semifinals, which will be played in New Jersey (21:00 CEST, 03:00pm EST).

Marciniak is the most experienced referee in European football and he's been in charge of many crucial games. He was the official in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and he also refereed Real Madrid's 1-0 win against Juventus in this current Club World Cup and the team's victory over Atletico de Madrid in the return leg of the Champions League's Round of 16. Real Madrid have a 6-2-3 record with the Polish referee in charge.

Marciniak will have his hands full in this game, as both teams will surely play with intensity and physicality given that they will be playing for a spot in the Final.

Where I stand after FIFA's latest tournament

Borussia Dortmund are out of the Club World Cup. 

Now that Dortmund are out of the tournament, I thought I'd provide some closing remarks, not so much on how the club in particular performed, but on the tournament as a whole, because I have some... thoughts.

The thing that frustrates me the most is that the format and the general concept for the CWC clearly have a lot of potential. The idea of club fans from around the world traveling to one country for a single tournament makes just as much sense as national team fans coming together for the FIFA World Cup. There are also many historic clubs around the world, and from the standpoint of football culture, the idea of Dortmund being able to play clubs like Boca Juniors, Palmeiras, and Monterrey in a context other than a meaningless friendly is legitimately really cool. Unfortunately, these concepts are undermined by the practical realities of putting such a tournament together. 

Here are some of the biggest challenges I'm finding that are preventing me from truly embracing the Club World Cup: 

Don't get me wrong, I've been impressed by the resilience that the non-European clubs have shown in the tournament. Boca Juniors put up stiff resistance against Bayern Munich, Lionel Messi led Inter Miami to victory over Porto, and Al-Hilal and Fluminese both defeated European teams in the Round of 16. Unfortunately, these results were the exception. 9 of the 16 clubs to make it out of the group stage were European, and here we are in the semifinals with three out of four clubs from Europe. Fluminese still have a chance, of course, but even if they go all the way, the fact that the best we can hope for is a stray Latin club going on a run doesn't seem sustainable. 

Unfortunately, this is a pretty insurmountable problem to overcome, and there aren't any perfect solutions without major tradeoffs. The European advantage in football isn't going anywhere anytime soon, and if anything it will probably continue to grow over time. The most expedient way to give other clubs a chance to go further would simply be to invite fewer European clubs, but they're obviously the biggest revenue drivers of the tournament, so FIFA won't want to do that. 

I'm not going to say that “nobody” cares about this tournament, because quite clearly, a lot of the players care quite deeply, especially those from non-European teams. Look at Fluminese celebrating their win over Inter if you disagree: 

Mira nada más a los cabrones del FLUMINENSE celebrando que eliminaron al actual subcampeón de la Champions, bendito sea el puto fútbol pic.twitter.com/xZPdoajaoe

The same cannot be said for everyone, though. Granted, this is just from my own subjective analysis, but it doesn't seem to me that the Dortmund players have taken this tournament very seriously. From their muted celebrations to the Dortmund bench watching the game from the locker room to avoid the heat. It has given the vibe that the players just see this as something they need to push through, like a long day of busy work at the office. 

There is simply not enough time to hold this tournament without it being a massive inconvenience. When it's held in the middle of the summer like this year, it merely lengthens an already too-long season and decreases the increasingly scarce rest that players have. 

There is pretty much no solution to this that doesn't involve cutting some other competition(s), whether it's the various Nations Leagues, international friendlies, or even decreasing the size of domestic club competitions. Knowing FIFA, that will never happen. 

I don't hate the Club World Cup. I actually think it could work if competitive leagues were more evenly distributed across continents, or if it wasn't shoehorned into an already crowded schedule. Unfortunately, it simply isn't a good fit for how the sport is organized right now, and the changes required to fix it would have negative repercussions elsewhere. Until then, this tournament will continue to mostly be an afterthought.

Former champions Chelsea play Fluminense, one of Brazil's most popular sides, in the first semifinal of FIFA Club World Cup.

Who: Chelsea vs Fluminense

What: Semifinal, FIFA Club World Cup 2025

Where: MetLife Stadium, New Jersey, United States

When: Tuesday, July 8 at 3pm local time (19:00 GMT)

How to follow: We'll have all the build-up on Al Jazeera Sport from noon (16:00 GMT) in advance of our live text commentary stream.

Chelsea will be hoping to seal their spot in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup (CWC) final with victory against Brazil's Fluminense in the opening semifinal on Tuesday.

The Blues are striving to become the first side to win the CWC for a second time but face a formidable task against the Rio de Janeiro giants, who are unbeaten in the tournament.

Here is all to know before their semifinal showdown at MetLife Stadium, just outside New York:

Chelsea finished second in Group D to another Brazilian super club, Flamengo.

The London-based club opened their campaign with a 2-1 win over Los Angeles FC, before stumbling to a tough 3-1 loss against Flamengo. They qualified for the knockout stage with a 3-0 defeat of Esperance de Tunisie.

Enzo Maresca's side faced the Group C winners Benfica in the last 16, beating the Portuguese side 4-1 after extra time.

The Blues then played a second Brazilian club in the quarterfinals, beating Palmeiras 2-1 to qualify for the final four.

Fluminense, who qualified for the CWC as winners of the 2023 Copa Libertadores, were unbeaten in Group F, finishing second behind Borussia Dortmund with one win and two draws.

They played out a 0-0 scoreline with Dortmund in their tournament opener, then defeated South Korean side Ulsan HD 4-2. In their final group fixture, they played out 0-0 against Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa.

In the knockout phase, Fluminense upset Inter Milan 2-0 in Charlotte, then ended the fairytale run of Saudi club Al Hilal in the quarterfinal, winning 2-1 and booking their place in Tuesday's semifinal.

The inspirational 40-year-old, regarded by many as one of the greatest defenders of all time, is the former skipper of Chelsea, having played more than 150 matches for the English club from 2020 until 2024.

Silva was a fan favourite at Stamford Bridge and won three trophies during his time with Chelsea, including the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.

Silva is expected to be in the starting XI against his old club.

This will be the first competitive meeting between Fluminense and Chelsea.

Chelsea won the 18th edition of the CWC in 2021, hosted in the United Arab Emirates.

The Blues won the final 2-1 against Palmeiras at the Mohammed bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi.

The tournament was originally planned to take place in late 2021 in Japan, but was moved to February 2022 in the UAE due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Fluminense made their Club World Cup debut at the 2023 tournament in Saudi Arabia, making it all the way to the final in Jeddah where they lost to Manchester City 4-0.

Chelsea will be without Levi Colwill and Liam Delap after both received their second yellow cards of the tournament against Palmeiras in the quarterfinal.

Moises Caicedo will rejoin the Blues squad after serving his suspension.

On the injury front, Romeo Lavia and Reece James were both held back against Palmeiras and are questionable heading into Tuesday's match. Omari Kellyman is unavailable for selection.

Fluminense will be without Juan Pablo Freytes and Mathues Martinelli – who scored the game-winner against Al Hilal in the quarterfinal – after both received their second yellow cards of the tournament in their last-eight final against the Saudi club.

Key defender Rene returns to the club from suspension and is expected to reclaim his place in the starting XI at the expense of Gabriel Fuentes, whom coach Renato Gaucho might redeploy in an attacking midfield role against Chelsea.

Talisman Jhon Arias should again lead Fluminense's forward line.

Central midfielder Otavio was a pretournament scratching after suffering a season-ending Achilles tendon tear in May.

Chelsea: Sanchez; Gusto, Tosin, Chalobah, Cucurella; Fernandez, Caicedo; Neto, Palmer, Nkunku; Pedro

Fluminense: Fabio; Ignacio, Silva, Rene; Xavier, Hercules, Bernal, Nonato, Fuentes; Arias, Cano

Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca said: “I watched some games that they [Fluminense] have played. And you can see that they are very well-organised. They have some very good players. The manager [Gaucho] is doing a fantastic job.”

“And again, it will be the same [in the semi] final. The energy from the Brazilian team in this competition has been high … Probably … because you are starting now the season, while we are finishing the season. So, the energy is normal. It is different. And we try to deal with that in a different way.”

Renato Gaucho, who has helped Fluminense defy the odds to knock out Champions League runners-up Inter Milan in the last 16 and Al Hilal in the quarterfinals, spoke after his side qualified for the semifinal against Chelsea.

“It is another step forward, thanks to everyone's efforts. Participating in the Club World Cup is a unique opportunity … We do not know when we will have the chance to participate again. I dedicate this qualification [victory over Al Hilal] to our fans, and I imagine the wonderful atmosphere in Rio de Janeiro, just as it was wonderful here in the stadium, it was a deserved victory.”

FIFA slashed standard ticket prices for the Club World Cup  semifinal between Chelsea and Fluminense at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on Tuesday to $13.40, down from $473.90 earlier in the past week.

FIFA has used dynamic pricing for the 63-game tournament.  

Standard ticket prices for Wednesday's semifinal between European champion Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid at MetLife Stadium start at $199.60. The championship will be played there on July 13. 

FIFA previously dropped ticket prices to $11.15 for a quarterfinal in Orlando, Florida, between Fluminense and Al Hilal and in Philadelphia between Chelsea and Palmeiras.

The dramatic drop in prices was first reported by The Athletic.

Many matches during the tournament have had sparse crowds. Real Madrid has been an exception, drawing at least 60,000 for all five of its matches, including 76,611 for its quarterfinal win Saturday over Borussia Dortmund in New Jersey.

MetLife Stadium is also slated to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup final.

U.S. players were crestfallen after another loss to Mexico, but this tournament was a down payment on the 2026 World Cup

HOUSTON - As various dignitaries ascended the hastily built stage at the center of NRG Stadium on Sunday night, several of the U.S. men's national team's young players sat, dejected. A few had heads in hands. Others simply stared up at the roof, as if that would change what had just happened.

They were likely thinking about the moments that got away, the mistakes that had consequences, the calls - right or wrong - that impacted the outcome. Mostly, they were frustrated that they were not the ones set to ascend that stage to lift the 2025 Gold Cup.

Ultimately, the U.S. fell short. One goal short, but that's why they keep score. There would be no celebration, no culture-defining storybook ending about defying the odds. This was Mexico's day and Mexico's tournament - as it had been nine times before - and El Tri's 2-1 victory before a pro-Mexico crowd was tough to swallow.

There were moments of joy along the way, of course, and plenty of them - five consecutive wins to reach the Gold Cup final, which helped erase the sting of four straight losses entering the tournament.. There were a few on Sunday, too. Yet in the end, inexperience proved the USMNT's undoing - along with an attacking, threatening Mexico side.

""I told every player after the game how proud I was just of the growth of every single individual,"" said Tyler Adams. ""As a team, you look around the locker room and I couldn't be more proud of the guys who just got so close over these last five weeks. So many sacrifices, so much to be here spending time away from their families, their clubs. To come together as a new group and make a final? It's a positive and we'll make sure it carries forward.""

There will be plenty of discussion about what this tournament meant for the USMNT, good, bad and indifferent. There will be an attempt to contextualize an odd summer, one that both prepared the U.S. for 2026 and - with player absences galore - didn't. Still, there are no feel-good runners-up. In the end, all the U.S. could do was look up in frustration, realizing they had wasted an early goal and ultimately fell short.

As Mexico lifted the trophy with pyrotechnics exploding and raucous Mexico fans screaming, the U.S. players walked off. Only a few bothered to look back. It's onto the next, particularly with a World Cup a year away. But for those who grinded through this summer, Sunday's defeat will sting for some time.

""I think everyone grieves differently, but I think some people - and I know myself personally it hurt - but maybe it's something that needed to happen,"" Chris Richards said. ""You take it on the chin and you keep pushing forward. And I promise you we won't lose anymore finals against Mexico. I threw my medal away. There's no point in having a silver medal. I think, as a nation, we strive for greatness. And I think, as individuals, we do, too. So, going forward, that's what we're going to do.""

Mikel Arteta has finally listened to the pleas of the Gunners faithful by moving for the prolific Sweden international

""When you look at the injuries and you look at the players that came, OK, he brought players – he got [Raheem] Sterling when everyone wanted a nine,"" Thierry Henry said on The Stick to Football podcast, brought to you by Sky Bet, when assessing Mikel Arteta's transfer choices after seeing Arsenal finish second in the Premier League for the third year in a row. ""He had time to get a nine, he had time. I'm not the coach, I don't know how the discussion went. Everyone has been screaming for a nine.""

The Arsenal faithful had indeed been ""screaming"" for a new striker throughout the 2024 summer window, but Bologna defender Riccardo Calafiori and Real Sociedad midfielder Mikel Merino were the only two major permanent deals that Arsenal closed, while Sterling arrived from Chelsea on loan. Arteta inexplicably decided to keep faith in Kai Havertz and the injury-plagued Gabriel Jesus - the only proper No.9 signed by the Spaniard in his entire reign to date - to finally get the Gunners over the title line, and unsurprisingly, it backfired.

Liverpool won the 2024-25 Premier League crown with four games to spare as Arsenal struggled for the consistency of previous seasons amid an injury crisis that claimed the likes of Havertz, Jesus, Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Magalhaes, Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Martinelli, and Calafiori. Arteta's side did enjoy a run to the Champions League semi-finals, but were ultimately outclassed by Paris Saint-Germain, and ended up extending their trophy drought to five years.

Bad luck undoubtedly played a part in that, but Arteta's poor planning in the transfer market was the main reason for Arsenal's failure, and there will be no hiding place for the 43-year-old coach if the same thing happens again next season. Arsenal are no longer making forward progress, and a change in the dugout will be inevitable if Arteta doesn't learn from his mistakes.

The early signs this summer, though, suggest that he has. After closing deals for Real Sociedad playmaker Martin Zubimendi and back-up goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, the Gunners are reportedly now closing in on a blockbuster transfer for Sporting CP sensation Viktor Gyokeres, who has all the attributes to be the transformational signing Arteta so desperately needs to deliver tangible success to the Emirates Stadium.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Al-Ahli have launched a bid to sign Lionel Messi that would see the Inter Miami star reunited with Cristiano Ronaldo in the Saudi Pro League.

Argentine icon Messi has been competing in MLS since deciding to chase the American dream in the summer of 2023. He snubbed interest from the Middle East at that stage, despite lucrative contract offers being on the table.

Messi has enjoyed Leagues Cup and Supporters' Shield triumphs in the United States, while being named MVP for 2024, but is seeing his contract in South Florida run down. He is only tied to terms through to the end of the year.

With no extension being agreed, despite a 12-month option being in place, Messi is free to speak with any interested parties outside of America. According to L'Equipe, Al-Ahli are making a serious play for the 38-year-old's signature.

They are looking to do a deal that would see Messi take on a new challenge in December. No financial details of the approach are being revealed, but Saudi Arabia is reportedly doing “everything it can to tip the scales”.

A stunning switch late in 2025 would see Messi come up against eternal rival Ronaldo once more, as the Portuguese GOAT has agreed a new two-year contract with Al-Nassr. They - having once graced opposing sides of the fierce Clasico divide that exists between Barcelona and Real Madrid - are both looking to compete at the next World Cup in 2026.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Arsenal are on the verge of sealing a transfer for Viktor Gyokeres after agreeing to match Sporting CP's demands for the striker. The Gunners have agreed personal terms with the Swede, who has made up his mind about moving to the Premier League this summer. With Gyokeres' transfer almost sealed, Arsenal are no longer pursuing a move for RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.

Arsenal could finally get the top striker they have been craving, with reports suggesting that Viktor Gyokeres is close to signing. Gyokeres is not keen on returning to Sporting, but the Gunners must find an agreement with the Portuguese club regarding the transfer fee.

Following criticism for their lack of focus in securing a top striker, the North London side is looking to address this issue this summer. Previous rumours linking them with Swedish international Gyokeres seem set to become a reality.

According to multiple media reports (via Fabrizio Romano), Arsenal are now edging closer to securing the 27-year-old attacker. The Gunners have reportedly agreed on personal terms with Gyokeres' camp, but must now work on a deal with Sporting.

The former Brighton and Hove Albion forward has informed his plan to part ways with his current club and won't be joining their preseason training camp. Romano even added that Gyokeres is open to giving up 2m Euros from his salary to facilitate his move from Sporting to Arsenal.

An agreement could arrive soon, as long as both parties are not too far apart in their valuation for the striker. Before dealing with Gyokeres, Arsenal have already added some new faces to their squad this season with the arrival of Kepa Arrizabalaga and Martin Zubimendi.

When you blitz into the Final Eight in your debut at Roland-Garros, it makes sense for the tennis community to immediately take you for a star in the making. That's exactly what happened with Amanda Anisimova. The American star announced her triumphant debut at the 2019 French Open by becoming the first player born in the 21st century to reach the quarterfinals of the tournament. While that campaign ultimately came to a halt in the semis, where Australia's Ashleigh Barty finally managed to stop Anisimova in her tracks, it was clear that the latter was here to stay. But soon, disaster struck.

In the summer of 2022, Anisimova lost her father and coach, Konstantin. Goes without saying, the incident rocked Amanda's world. To cope with the stress and turmoil, Amanda declared in May 2023 that she would go into an indefinite hiatus in order to find balance inside her head. Well, looking at how 2025 is panning out for the 23-year-old, it can be safely assumed that Anisimova has found the closure she needed. However, for those who have walked a similar road, the burden that you inevitably carry on is apparent, even as the 2025 Qatar Open champ continues to reach new heights.

In a YouTube upload by Tennis Channel on July 6, ex-pro player Jim Courier opened up on how the scar might still be lingering inside Anisimova's mind despite playing some of the best tennis of her career at SW19. Talking about how life caught Amanda off-guard, Courier said, “She burst on the scene as a semi-finalist at Roland Garros, right? Young woman playing the sport, and then life intervenes. She had some real stuff…Her father passed away, took some time away to regroup, and now she's on the verge of making another semi-final here against Pavlyuchenkova,” noting that Anisimova can very well defeat the Russian when they cross paths at the Wimbledon quarterfinal tomorrow.

“…you can just see it means more now than it did then. She was innocent when she first burst on. She's had the real world come up and give her, you know, a real dose. So, it's going to be deeper in meaning for her,” the former professional tennis star kept speaking his mind about why Anisimova's run at the British Slam is so noteworthy. While Courier noted that pain and loss in personal life can be a great motivator, it also comes with a caveat.

The 4x Grand Slam-winning star went on about why Anisimova seemed so emotional after securing her spot in the quarterfinal by defeating Linda Noskova (6-2, 7-5, 6-4)in the Round of 16. “Sometimes it's harder when it means more like this to overcome that scar tissue that you're carrying. So, that's why I think why she was crying after the win. That's a massive moment for her,” Courier explained.

But we do understand why Courier feels that the young American has a lot on her mind even while making waves at Wimbledon. After all, Amanda mentioned it herself that she had to work extra hard to overcome the demons.

Can Anisimova's emotional resilience propel her to another Grand Slam semifinal, or will past scars hold her back?

Just days before stepping into the thick of things at Wimbledon, Anisimova talked about how her recent years have been more like a whirlwind of things, and how she came up with creative ideas to tackle those head-on. “I feel like tennis is such a rollercoaster. Maybe I could compare it to rap because I get pretty serious on the court – sometimes a bit aggressive,” she told Olympics.com about how hip-hop is the music genre that she finds similar to her playing style.

With the star reaching the quarterfinal stage at the tournament in 2022, justifiably, many fans were left heartbroken for being denied the chance to see how she could improve on her SW19 result in the next year. While her decision to stay away from the tennis court took the world by surprise in 2023, especially with the announcement arriving just one month before Wimbledon that year, Anisimova knew that was the right call for her to get her house in order. And she managed to find her calm in art.

“I picked that hobby up when I was struggling with my mental health. It was definitely something that I really enjoyed off the court, for a few hours to reset my mind,” Anisimova said on June 29 about how Vincent van Gogh was the one who inspired her to pursue her love for the arts. “It was special to me,” she admitted. However, in every step of the way, her team kept their hand on her shoulders, making sure that Amanda didn't have to navigate through the troubled waters all by herself.

Accor's Pullman Dubai Downtown is serving up a hospitality experience with the launch of the Roland-Garros themed suites – the first of its kind in the Middle East, developed as a part of  ALL Accor's loyalty program, and an official partner of the tournament since 2015.

Paul Stevens, Chief Operating Officer, Premium, Midscale & Economy Division, Middle East, Africa & Türkiye at Accor says, “Through our global partnership with Roland-Garros, we're proud to bring this iconic French sporting experience to the region. More than a themed stay, this collaboration celebrates culture and sport in the heart of Dubai, aligning with the UAE's vision to become a global hub for lifestyle, tourism, and innovation in hospitality.”

“We've moved from visibility to immersion. These fully transformed properties with Roland-Garros-inspired design, programming, and fan zones allow guests to live the tournament spirit wherever they are,” says Kerry Healy, Chief Commercial Officer, Premium, Midscale & Economy, Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific at Accor.

It transforms a signature suite into an immersive, grand slam-inspired tennis retreat, offering guests a chance to experience the Parisian tournament in the heart of Dubai. But this activation is just one part of a much larger play for emotional loyalty, immersive experiences, and global brand storytelling.



ALL Accor branding is prominently featured on-site at Roland-Garros, from courtside signage to hospitality spaces and fan activations. Healy notes, the branded suites were the result of a significant uplift in net media value for ALL Accor (their loyalty program) following the renewed Roland-Garros partnership in 2014, particularly due to enhanced brand visibility on the tournament's main courts.

At the same time, viewership of Roland-Garros grew across priority markets for Accor, not just the Middle East, but globally, including Brazil, the U.S., Western Europe, and China. These insights revealed a strong appetite for premium, lifestyle-driven sports content among global audiences.

In response, Accor strategically rebranded select hotels to bring the tournament's unique energy and atmosphere directly to guests.

“That's why we extended the experience beyond the screen, rebranding select hotels and creating immersive Roland-Garros atmospheres on property, to engage tennis fans and guests locally in an authentic, emotionally resonant way,” comments Healy.

The combination of branding and loyalty efforts strengthens Accor's engagement with its audience, extending its reach beyond the tournament itself and into its own suites.

Open from May 27, 2025, to May 2026, the immersive suites and hotel transformations launched at Pullman flagship properties in Paris, Tokyo, and São Paulo – each being the first and only officially licensed Roland-Garros themed suites ever created in their respective countries. These activations are tailored to reflect the local market while staying true to the brand's cosmopolitan and experiential DNA.

The suite highlights an immersive in-room design with bespoke Roland-Garros décor, exclusive gaming content, and curated culinary offerings, aimed at engaging tennis fans, design lovers, and cosmopolitan travellers alike.

“Our strategy focuses on direct engagement with tennis fans, lifestyle travellers, and ALL Accor loyalty members, using both global and hyper-local tools,” says Healy.

In parallel, Pullman Dubai Downtown activated live tournament screenings and themed events at Breadhouse Bistro & Bakery to further amplify the Grand Slam energy for guests and locals. In-hotel activations, like watch parties, themed dining menus, and immersive fan zones, supported converting locals and walk-ins into brand advocates, making the experience accessible even without a suite booking. And finally, the Limitless Experiences rewarded members with access to Roland-Garros, building emotional loyalty and word-of-mouth buzz far beyond the campaign window.

The global media rollout was launched on platforms like YouTube and Meta and is being tailored to meet younger audiences where they live and engage online. The 360° content strategy included behind-the-scenes footage, influencer collaborations, and immersive storytelling across social media and digital channels to drive emotional connection and virality.

Hyper-targeted digital ads on platforms like Meta and YouTube, tailored by market (including the UAE, France, Japan, Brazil, and more), are being used to reach tennis audiences during high-intent moments – especially around key tournament dates.



While not explicitly targeted at high-net-worth individuals, the Roland-Garros audience naturally overlaps with Accor's luxury and premium segments. But there's also a strong generational element to the marketing initiative.

“We're not just targeting traditional tennis fans; we're intentionally reaching younger, experience-driven audiences who value curated, culturally relevant brand moments,” says Healy. “Younger demographics, particularly Millennials and Gen Z, are increasingly drawn to brands that offer more than just a product or service. They want emotionally resonant experiences, personal relevance, and digital-first engagement. That's exactly what this Roland-Garros partnership delivers.”

She continues, “By elevating ALL Accor as not just a loyalty program but a cultural connector, linking tennis, travel, and lifestyle, we're speaking directly to younger consumers who want to align with brands that share their passions in travel, sport, and unique experiences.”

The initiative aligns with ALL Accor's broader mission: to evolve its loyalty program into a global lifestyle brand. At the 2024 tournament, Accor launched Advantage ALL.com, a new platform connecting tennis fans with privileged access to hotels, curated experiences, and exclusive rewards.

Healy says, “Our partnership reflects a long-term strategic commitment to elevating ALL Accor, our loyalty program, as a global lifestyle and hospitality brand, particularly in the world of sport,” says Kerry Healy, Chief Commercial Officer, Premium, Midscale & Economy, Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific at Accor.

“This platform connects tennis fans with the world of ALL Accor, offering privileged hotel access, loyalty rewards, and curated lifestyle experiences. Our goal is to make ALL Accor the natural choice for tennis enthusiasts, not just during the tournament, but year-round,” She adds.

As a result, the branded suite aims to deliver a Grand Slam experience while aligning with ALL Accor's ongoing mission to connect guests with culture, sport, and lifestyle experiences.

The Roland-Garros themed suites in Dubai is just the beginning. “Our work with Roland-Garros is a blueprint for how we blend brand, sport, lifestyle, and loyalty into a cohesive and enduring global platform, one that creates real value for guests, hotel owners, and the broader Accor ecosystem,” comments Healy.

She adds, “This isn't just about regional awareness. It's a global brand play. The goal is to scale and adapt this concept across other markets over time, depending on brand fit, guest appetite, and regional event relevance – so while it starts in Dubai for the Middle East, it's not the last.”

With international campaigns spanning France, the UK, the U.S., Australia, and Brazil, the brand is building a year-round lifestyle offering that meets guests at the intersection of passion and travel.

Umpire Nico Helwerth opted to replay a point when a 'human error' led to the line-calling technology being deactivated

Wimbledon 2025

Dates: 30 June-13 July Venue: All England Club

Coverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full coverage guide.

Wimbledon has made changes to its electronic line calling system to remove the possibility of ""human error"" after it was accidentally deactivated in a controversial episode on Sunday.

An ""operator error"" meant the ball-tracking technology was turned off for one game in the fourth-round match between Britain's Sonay Kartal and Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova on Centre Court.

""Following our review, we have now removed the ability for Hawk-Eye operators to manually deactivate the ball tracking,"" the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) said in a statement to BBC Sport.

""While the source of the issue was human error, this error cannot now be repeated due to the system changes we have made.""

Kartal sent a backhand long when game point down at 4-4, but this was not detected by the line-call system, which instead made two automated calls of ""stop"".

Umpire Nico Helwerth opted to replay the point - which Kartal won - but was criticised by Pavlyuchenkova and some pundits for not using his authority to overrule and call the ball out.

TV replays had shown the ball was well long and Pavlyuchenkova suggested there should be a video review system, similar to that in football, which would have enabled the umpire to make the call. 

The AELTC said Helwerth had ""followed the established process"", but later added that the issue of video reviews would be ""among the matters considered"" at the end of the Championships. 

Club chief executive Sally Bolton said earlier on Monday that Helwerth was ""having a rest day"".

""We have rotation of our umpires regularly. A little bit like the players, the umpires also need rest days throughout the tournament,"" Bolton told BBC Sport.

""He's having a rest day today. He's fine. 

""It's really important to say that the umpire followed the protocols in place. He did what he needed to do on court and acted entirely correctly.""

Tennis losing its charm because of technology - Pavlyuchenkova

Electronic line calling is used at many top-level tournaments, and the US Open and Australian Open also have a video review system.

When there were line judges at Wimbledon, players could challenge the calls by using an electronic review. The new technology is an ""enhanced"" version of the Hawk-Eye system that was used for player challenges.

There are no challenges under the current system and video replays are not used.

At the moment, replays of points can be shown on the big screens - but they are essentially replays of what the technology has determined and only show that something was a ""close call"".

But with millions able to see the replays of points on their televisions at home, fans will always wonder why the umpire is not able to use that footage if they are unsure over a call.

Pavlyuchenkova suggested tennis should use video checks like football does ""so that we can review the point"".

""On such a big event I think it is necessary, since this isn't the first time this has happened,"" she told BBC Sport on Sunday.

The AELTC said: ""We do not have a video review system as part of our suite of officiating tools.

""As we do every year, we will fully review all aspects of The Championships' operation following the event and this will be among the matters considered.""

There is a line-calling hub inside Wimbledon's grounds, where 50 operators use 144 screens to monitor the ball-tracking footage from 12 cameras on each court. 

Wimbledon's first week of electronic line calling system has been a big topic of discussion. 

Some players questioned its accuracy, others said the calls were too quiet - and some simply missed the 147-year-old tradition of smartly dressed officials around the court.

Former British number one and BBC pundit Tim Henman pointed to the accuracy of the technology as a reason why video reviews were not necessary. 

""The technology, when it's activated, works extremely well,"" he said.

""There's another sort of narrative that the line calling has been inaccurate, and that's just absolute rubbish.

""When you're on the court, you're hoping that it goes out, because if it goes out, you win the point. 

""But actually, 100 times out of 100 when you go back and look at it, the human - the player - gets it wrong. The technology doesn't.""

The AELTC said it continued to have ""full confidence in the accuracy of the ball-tracking technology"".

In response to player concerns about not hearing the calls sometimes, the club added that it was ""adjusting the volume all the time, given the ambient noise on court and around the grounds"".

Emma Navarro had a spell in the middle of the match but ultimately Mirra Andreeva was just too good and some of the shots in there were breath-taking.

Can she put some pressure on Mirra Andreeva's serve? 

*Navarro 2-6 2-4 Andreeva

Well, how about that for a response?

Emma Navarro reduces Mirra Andreeva's lead to a break in this second set.

It feels like she needs the frustration of losing her serve to come out and play with more aggression - and it worked there.

Can she keep it up? 

Navarro 2-6 1-4 Andreeva*

Mirra Andreeva is running away with this.

She gets the double break and it's all of Emma Navarro's making.

The American 11th seed saves two break points before succumbing to the third.

The Russian teenager is in cruise control now.

*Navarro 2-6 1-3 Andreeva

Martina NavratilovaNine-time Wimbledon singles champion on BBC TV

Navarro is standing about 4ft behind the baseline. She would make her life so much easier if she just moved forward a little bit so she is not having to cut the corner to reach a shot. 

Navarro is hanging in there but she is not getting any freebies from Andreeva. She is also struggling to get first serves in. 

Shelton 3-6 6-1 7-6 (7-1) 4-3 Sonego*

Still on serve in the fourth set on Court One.

The power of the Ben Shelton serve is such that Lorenzo Sonego has to be faultless in his returning.

He's been extremely good today but Shelton still holds to love in his latest service game.

We're approaching the business end of the fourth now. Will we get a fifth?

*Navarro 2-6 1-3 Andreeva

Well, that is an almighty hold for Mirra Andreeva.

Her level has definitely dropped here but the Russian manages to save three break point opportunities from Emma Navarro.

The American is hitting so much better and playing far more aggressively.

But that was a huge missed opportunity for her.

Andreeva just has more options today - she can add the height when she needs to or the injection of pace, especially on the first serve that we have seen time and time again.

It just looks like she has so much more confidence. In these tight matches, she can sometimes get quite tight and irritable but we haven't seen her get close to that today.

Gary RoseBBC Sport at Wimbledon

Emma Navarro looked up to the sky after being lulled into moving into the middle of the court before Mirra Andreeva sent a forehand down the line. 

The celebration of getting a break was all too brief for Navarro, as Andreeva just swiftly broke again.

Shelton 3-6 6-1 7-6 (7-1) 3-2 Sonego*

Lorenzo Sonego holds to love as if to let Ben Shelton know that he's not going anywhere in this match.

The Italian hammers home the point by bring up break point with a vicious overhead smash but Shelton shows fantastic touch at the net to save it.

Serve and volley, the ball dips at his feet but the half-volley drop shot from Shelton in near-perfect.

It's getting noisy out there with shouts from both players but after another massive serve down the middle, it's a big hold for the American.

Navarro 2-6 1-2 Andreeva*

Three games have been played in this second set and there have been three breaks of serve.

Mirra Andreeva gets her nose back in front again.

She came out punching there, probably angered by that sloppy service game last time out. 

*Navarro 2-6 1-1 Andreeva

Emma Navarro's playing with so much more aggression now and it's paying off.

The American breaks back to put us back on serve in this second set. 

Shelton 3-6 6-1 7-6 (7-1) 2-1 Sonego*

A big serve down the T clinches a comfortable hold for Ben Shelton.

The American 10th seed is showing no signs of letting up after his impressive showing in the third-set tie-break.

Navarro 2-6 0-1 Andreeva*

Gary RoseBBC Sport at Wimbledon

There's more people in their seats now, perhaps drawn in by the oohs and ahhs that followed that amazing first-game rally that ended with Mirra Andreeva getting an immediate break. Emma Navarro must be wondering what she has to do to beat the teenager.

Navarro 2-6 0-1 Andreeva*

Oh my goodness. 

Mirra Andreeva, that is phenomenal.

The Russian was 30-0 down but wins three points in a row to earn the break point.

The longest rally of the match follows, with Andreeva spending most of it defending against the aggression of Emma Navarro.

But the teenager turns defence into attack to hit a cross-court forehand winner for the break.

Shelton 3-6 6-1 7-6 (7-1) 1-0 Sonego*

A very telling stat has just flashed up on BBC coverage.

Lorenzo Sonego has a 6-32 record against top 10 players. He has lost his past 14 such encounters.

The Italian needs to win the next two sets to halt that sequence - he takes Ben Shelton to deuce to start set four but is fuming after a backhand goes long and the American goes on to hold.

One is a chatty 18-year-old long tipped as a future Grand Slam champion.

The other is a straight-talking 53-year-old former Wimbledon winner, who has also coached another top player to the title.

Together, Mirra Andreeva and her coach Conchita Martinez are forming a successful double act.

""Mirra is a very special player and very complete in everything she does – but also improvable. I think she has a lot to learn,"" said Spaniard Martinez, who memorably won the 1994 title.

""If I won Wimbledon - I was more of a clay-court player - then I think she has a good shot of winning.""

Ben Shelton isn't the only tennis star in his family. 

Emma Shelton, the sister of the 22-year-old tennis phenom, has become a breakout star during her brother's run at Wimbledon — and has gotten plenty of TV  time during Shelton's run at the All England Club.

It started when Shelton defeated Hungary's Marton Fucsovics in straight sets to reach the Round of 16  on Saturday.

Following the match, Shelton gave Emma a shout-out, calling her his “lucky charm” throughout the tournament, and explained she needed more PTO from her job at Morgan Stanley to stay in London to support him.

“My sister's here,” Shelton said after his victory on Saturday. “She's been here for every match I've played in this tournament so far. She's been the lucky charm. But she has work back in the U.S. starting on Monday. She works for Morgan Stanley.”

The crowd began booing as the camera focused on Emma, who was laughing while covering her mouth  with her hands. 

“Ay ay ay! Come on now,” Shelton continued. “So if any of y'all have some connects and can get her a couple extra days off, we're gonna keep this rolling and that would be great.”

Shelton's parents and his girlfriend, USWNT star Trinity Rodman, were seen laughing.

Emma, a former college tennis player at the University of Florida and South Carolina, is a digital virtual engagement associate at Morgan Stanley in Georgia, according to her LinkedIn profile. 

She played two seasons with the Gamecocks women's tennis team before transferring to the University of Florida, where her father serves as the head coach of the men's team.

In the 2022-23 season, her last, Emma was a perfect 5-0 in singles play at the Bedford Cup en route to claiming the Green bracket individual title.

Shelton, chasing his first-ever singles Grand Slam, previously shared in an Instagram Story video that Emma got the first week of July off from work to support him at Wimbledon.

She was seen jumping up and down in the clip.

Emma returned to the All England Club on Monday for Ben's fourth-round match against Italian Lorenzo Sonego, and was seen sitting with Rodman and parents Bryan and Lisa.

“[Emma's] still around here because Ben's urging probably helped her company, her employer … let her stay a little longer and skip a little more work,” one of the announcers said as cameras captured Shelton's family in the stands.

The announcers also discussed the boos that came during Emma's previous appearance.

“Were those boos just because she works back in the U.S.?” one of the announcers said.

“I am not sure,” another broadcast replied. “But you know what they, you gotta keep the rhythm going. A lot of players they like when they look up at the player's box and see the same people seeing in the same area time and time again. So maybe for Ben it is important to see Emma with mom, dad, coach in that order.”

Shelton was up by two sets in his match against Sonego as of Monday afternoon. The fourth round is the furthest Shelton has advanced at Wimbledon.","{'href': 'https://nypost.com', 'title': 'New York Post'}","tennis"

Emma Raducanu will lose a huge amount of her Wimbledon prize money after raking in six figures at SW19. The young Brit was dumped out in the third round, losing to Aryna Sabalenka in straight sets. It followed one-sided wins over Mimi Xu and Marketa Vondrousova in her opening two matches.

Raducanu put up a good fight against Sabalenka, taking the first set to a tiebreak, but the Belarusian ultimately proved too strong. She will be paid handsomely for making it to the third round, with the 22-year-old entitled to receive £152,000 in prize money. Had she managed to beat Sabalenka and get through to round four, she would have won £240,000.

The former US Open champion will not get to keep it all, though. She will be presented with a hefty tax bill, which will see almost half of her Wimbledon prize money taken away.

Paul Barham, tax partner at Forvis Mazars, told Express Sport: ""Assuming that Emma is an additional rate taxpayer (with other income over £125,140), the tax rate that will apply to the prize money will be 45 per cent resulting in a UK tax liability of £68,400.

""Assuming Emma is resident in the UK, she is also likely to have Class Four National Insurance to pay at two per cent on this income resulting in a National Insurance liability of £3,040. Therefore, her take home pay after tax and NIC would be £80,560.

""These figures represent the liabilities before taking into account any deductible expenses such as travel and accommodation costs and coaching fees. These expenses can be deducted from the taxable amount and will therefore reduce the final tax bill.""

Raducanu was visibly emotional in the wake of her defeat to Sabalenka, admitting that it was hard to see the positives in her post-match press conference.

""I think I'm just very self-critical,"" she explained. ""It's hard to see. Of course, I'm very proud of being competitive on the court. I think I would rather that than it being completely one way.

""I think it's difficult to see that right now, having just come off the court. It's hard to take a loss like that. At the same time, I'm playing Aryna, who is No. 1 in the world, a great champion. I have to be proud of my effort today.""

Sabalenka, meanwhile, has set up a quarter-final date with Laura Siegemund after beating Elise Mertens in the fourth round. If she goes all the way and wins her first Wimbledon title, she will land a whopping £3million in prize money.

The champions of the 2025 Wimbledon men's and women's singles will each win £3m in prize money - a rise of £300,000 from last year.

There is a total prize fund of £53.55m at the tournament - split across all rounds of every competition. Also included in that figure is money won by players in the men's and women's singles that entered qualification.

Reaching the first round of the competition earns players £66,000. That figure jumps to £99,000 for players moving into the second round.

Getting beyond that and into the last 32 takes players to £152,000, while those making the last 16 will earn £240,000 each.

Players reaching the quarter-finals will earn £400,000, and a win in that round to progress to the semi-finals would take players to £775,000.

Finishing as the runner-up in one of the singles competitions is worth £1.52m.

There are prize pots for the other competitions at the Championships, but they are significantly lower than the two main singles competitions.

Prize pots are not cumulative, with players jumping up a prize bracket until the round in which they are eliminated.

Novak Djokovic overcomes a tough start to defeat Alex de Minaur in four sets and reach the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. (0:41)

Novak Djokovic overcame an uncharacteristically unsteady start to avoid what would have been his earliest exit at Wimbledon since 2016, coming through for a 1-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 victory over 11th-seeded Alex De Minaur in the fourth round Monday.

Djokovic, who has won seven of his 24 Grand Slam titles at Wimbledon, advanced to his 63rd major quarterfinal. But very little went right at the outset for the 38-year-old.

After entering with 41 holds in 42 service games in the tournament, Djokovic was broken in five of his first seven against De Minaur, a 26-year-old Australian who was supposed face the Serb in last year's quarterfinals at Wimbledon but withdrew with an injured hip.

Despite producing merely four clean winners of his own in the opening set, De Minaur accumulated nearly twice as many points as Djokovic, 27-14. That's because Djokovic contributed a whopping 16 unforced errors.

He lost the opening set in 31 minutes. Before Monday, Djokovic had never won fewer than two games in an opening set at Wimbledon.

""I can't remember when I've seen him play a worse set than this,"" John McEnroe, who won Wimbledon three times in the 1980s, said on the BBC telecast. ""I mean, it's literally been years.""

But Djokovic turned things around in the middle sets, saying afterward that he reset himself in the second and considered the end of that one a momentum shift.

He really surged at the end after trailing 4-1 in the fourth. He saved a break point to avoid going down 5-1, taking the last five games and 14 of the final 15 points.

""I'm still trying to process the whole match and what happened on the court. It wasn't a great start for me, it was a great start for Alex,"" a relieved Djokovic said in his on-court interview. ""He was just managing the play better from the back of the court and I didn't have many solutions. I was very pleased to hang tough in the right moments and win this one.""

Djokovic was clearly discombobulated early, as he rushed between points and reacted to flubbed shots by rolling his eyes or putting his arms wide as if seeking explanations from someone, anyone.

At changeovers, he placed an ice-filled towel -- usually wrapped around necks by players in steamy conditions -- on his stomach, which he complained about during his first-round victory last week. But afterward, Djokovic dismissed the significance of that.

""Lot of cat and mouse play, a lot of slices,"" he said of what it's like playing De Minaur. ""It's extremely difficult to play someone like him if you're not feeling the ball very well.""

It was Djokovic's 101st career match win at Wimbledon, tying his most (101 at French Open) at any one major. That's also tied for the fourth-most match wins by any man at one major in the Open era.

Based on age on the final day of the tournament, Djokovic is the third-oldest man in the Open era to reach the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, after Roger Federer in 2021 and Ken Rosewall in 1974.

Novak Djokovic's 52 major wins when dropping the opening set are the most in the Open era. No one else has 45 such wins.

Federer, and eight-time champion at the All England Club, was sitting in the Royal Box to watch Djokovic's match on Centre Court.

""It's probably the first time he's watched me and I won the match. The last couple I lost,"" Djokovic said. ""So, good to break the curse.""

Djokovic has now won 43 of his past 45 matches at Wimbledon and not since 2017 has he failed to reach the final. The two losses were against reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz in the past two championship matches.

His bid for an eighth Wimbledon title and 25th Grand Slam singles trophy overall will continue against No. 22 Flavio Cobolli of Italy.

Cobolli reached his first major quarterfinal with a 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (4), 7-6 (3) victory over 2014 US Open champion and two-time major runner-up Marin Cilic.

Cobolli's season got off to a rocky start, as he lost seven consecutive tour-level matches beginning with his final match at the United Cup through the Miami Open. But he has been on a roll since, winning 20 of his last 27 tour-level matches that included two ATP titles at Bucharest and Hamburg during the European clay-court swing.

Marin Cilic has fired a broadside at the All England Club after the 2017 finalist bowed out of Wimbledon. The 36-year-old, who knocked out home favourite Jack Draper in the second round, was sent to Court Two for his round-of-16 match with Flavio Cobolli, the No.22 seed.

And in a morning start, the Italian beat Cilic 6-4 6-4 6-7 7-6 to set up a quarter-final showdown with Novak Djokovic. The Croatian admitted 23-year-old Cobolli had played “at a great level”, he was furious at the scheduling of his fourth round match.

Cilic, winner of the 2014 US Open, said: “I feel bitter. Why is there a need to play at 11 o'clock? The practice courts open at 9.30 - this morning, I had to warm up indoors. You wake up at 6am.

“Ok, the earlier rounds start at 11 but this is the last 16. It was raining overnight and the court was quite soft. It was really difficult to play on. You just push the ball in the middle of the court and the ball stays super low. It was just a struggle.”

And with the Italian being a clay court specialist, the conditions appeared to favour Cobolli.

Indeed, he admitted: “I think it helped me a lot to play on Court Two. I think it is a little bit slower than the other ones (Centre Court and Court One).”

But Cobolli is almost certain to be on Centre Court against 38-year-old Djokovic and said: “I don't want to think about the court. I just want to enjoy the day.

""I don't want to think about the other player. I want to think about myself. I want to have fun on every point I play on this kind of stage.

“This is something I have dreamt of since I was young, since I started to play tennis. I'm really emotional because this is a day that I will never forget, for sure. I am very proud of myself.”

And while he was not enamoured with the scheduling, Cilic was full of praise for his conqueror, saying: “Flavio played at a great level. There were not many things he did wrong. He was doing lots of things very cleanly. He served well and was putting me in a lot of tough positions.

“He played fantastically and it is great for him to be in his first quarter-final.”

Wimbledon 2025 has finally begun, and fans can still buy tickets to the sporting event right now.

Ben Shelton's final words after his Australian Open semifinal exit still echo with quiet confidence: “I know I'm close. I know my level's close. I know I have a lot of the stuff that I need. I certainly believe in myself.” True to his belief, the American pushed through the clay gauntlet in Paris, reaching the fourth round, and now carries that fire into Wimbledon. With only Taylor Fritz joining him in the QF hunt, Shelton now stands tall on the green stage, facing Italy's Lorenzo Sonego, a grass-court assassin who recently took out fellow American Brandon Nakashima in 5 sets. Can Shelton summon his power, belief, and grass-court swagger to break through? Let's dive into this electric showdown.

Ben Shelton's rise through the Wimbledon 2025 draw has been smooth, almost too smooth. With a straight-sets win over Hungary's Marton Fucsovics, the 21-year-old American stormed into the fourth round of a Slam for the sixth time in just 12 major appearances. That's a staggering level of consistency for someone still carving his name into the upper echelons of the men's game. But while his talent is undeniable, there's no denying lady luck has played her part in paving a path for Shelton at the majors, especially in the early rounds.

So far this Wimbledon, Shelton hasn't faced a single opponent ranked inside the Top 80. His path included No. 179 Alex Bolt, No. 87 Rinky Hijikata, and No. 105 Fucsovics. The average ranking of his opponents? A modest 124. He's only beaten a seeded player once en route to the fourth round of a Grand Slam.

Still, that doesn't take away from the clinical way he's dispatched his challengers without dropping a set. Against Fucsovics, Shelton powered down a 148 mph ace, equaling Andy Roddick's record for the most straight-sets wins by an American in the first three rounds at Wimbledon.

AD

Shelton's 2025 season has been impressive as well, including a semifinal appearance at the Australian Open, a quarterfinal run at Indian Wells, and his first ATP Top 10 debut following a strong Stuttgart showing. His biggest improvements under the watchful eye of his father-coach have come on the backhand wing and at the net, where he's now finishing 70% of his points successfully. Nicknamed a “servebot” for his blazing deliveries, Shelton has matured into more than just a cannonball server. He's becoming a grass-court threat.

However, Sonego hasn't had a standout season overall. After a quarterfinal finish in Melbourne, he stumbled with early exits in Madrid, Rome, and Paris. However, he's shown signs of life on the grass. The 2024 Winston-Salem Open champion cruised past Jaime Faria and Nikoloz Basilashvili before grinding out his epic against Nakashima. Ranked No. 47 in the world, Sonego has never been flashy on social media, but his tennis is speaking volumes again.

The H2H favors Shelton 3–1. Their last meeting? A five-set thriller in Paris at the French Open, where Shelton rallied for a 6–4, 4–6, 3–6, 6–2, 6–3 win on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Now, they meet again, this time under the shadow of Centre Court's sister, Court No. 1, with grass and adrenaline underfoot.

Is Ben Shelton's Wimbledon success due to skill, luck, or his sister's 'lucky charm' presence?

Debate

Shelton's booming serve is tailor-made for these slick lawns as well. With a 23–14 career record on grass, the American is no seasoned veteran, but his lefty serve-and-volley game is catching fire. Leading the 2025 ATP Tour in aces per match (7.7), winning 94% of matches where he serves more than 3.5 aces, and saving 69% of breakpoints, Shelton's serve is a lethal weapon. He wins 76% of his first-serve points and constantly applies pressure with bold court positioning.

Sonego's numbers aren't too shabby either, especially on hard courts, where he averages 9 aces and wins 73% of first-serve points. But grass isn't his most dominant surface. A baseliner by nature, he thrives on longer rallies and strategic point construction. He converts 33.5% of his return games, while Shelton averages 1.8 breaks per match in best-of-three contests, a stat that could prove critical in best-of-five Grand Slam play.

With fatigue creeping in for Sonego and Shelton brimming with confidence, momentum, and perhaps a bit of fortune, this matchup is tilted heavily in the American's favor. That said, don't count the Italian out just yet; his fight against Nakashima proves his resilience. Still, Shelton's weapons and freshness might be too much to handle.

A five-setter may be on the cards, but Shelton is clearly in the driver's seat. And with his lucky charm, alongside a 148-mph missile, riding shotgun, he may just floor it into the quarterfinals.

Ben Shelton has been blazing through Wimbledon, and while US soccer star and girlfriend Trinity Rodman has brought fierce courtside energy. However, it's his sister Emma Shelton who's quietly become his “lucky charm.” After sealing a commanding win over Marton Fucsovics, the American ace dropped a gem in his post-match interview that tugged on hearts, and maybe even a few corporate strings.

“I have been playing well this week. It's not just me here; I have a great team. My parents are here, and my girlfriend is here. Also, my sister is here; she's been here in every match I played in this tournament,” Shelton said. “She's been my lucky charm, but she has work back in the US, so on Monday, she works for Morgan Stanley. So when you have something next, so… give her a couple of extra days off so she can really give this role, and that'd be great.”

And just hours later, Ben gave fans a peek into a golden sibling moment via his Instagram Stories. From what looked like his hotel room, he captured Emma in the background as he cheekily asked, “you got the week off or what?” Emma responded with a happy dance, clearly banking on that Wimbledon magic. Ben followed it up with a shout that sealed the deal: “shoutout to Morgan Stanley.”

The fun didn't end there. Emma reposted the story, adding her twist with a playful caption: “thank you MS 💙💙💙, return flight got cancelled 🤪.”

With his sister still cheering from the stands and the QF on the horizon, all eyes are now on Shelton. Can the American powerhouse carry that energy to Centre Court? One thing's clear: he's got the luck and maybe even Wall Street on his side.

Roger Federer chose a special day to make his first appearance at this year's Championships at Wimbledon, where he was present in the Royal Box for former rival Novak Djokovic's fourth-round clash on Monday.

The record eight-time champion, Federer, made his 22nd and final professional appearance at SW19 in 2021, but has been an ever-present at the grass-court major since. Returning this year, the 43-year-old had the best seat in the house to watch Djokovic, who is aiming to equal the Swiss maestro's tally of eight crowns, in action against Alex de Minaur.

Back where he belongs ❤️🌱@rogerfederer | #Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/gMNqcTy3F7

Four of Federer and Djokovic's 50 Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings came at Wimbledon, including their epic five-set final in 2019. Federer held two championship points on his serve at 8-7, 40/15 in the fifth set before Djokovic stormed back to a deciding-set tie-break victory after four hours, 55 minutes.

Max Verstappen faced a tough afternoon at the British Grand Prix, with the Red Bull driver dropping backwards after a spin before recovering to fifth place.

Max Verstappen has given his take on a “very difficult race” at the British Grand Prix, with the Red Bull driver admitting that he had “no pace” on an afternoon that saw him recover to P5 following a spin at the second Safety Car restart.

After lining up in pole position, Verstappen initially led before being overtaken by McLaren's Oscar Piastri on Lap 8 of 52.

While a second Safety Car phase closed the gaps again – amid changing weather conditions – the Dutchman spun shortly after the restart, dropping him down the order.

From there Verstappen embarked on a recovery drive and crossed the line in fifth place, while Lando Norris took victory ahead of Piastri and Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg.

“It was just a very difficult race for us, but even after that spin I had no pace,” the four-time World Champion conceded when reflecting on his race.

“I was just stuck with that group and it was just very difficult to drive, and naturally of course we knew that it was going to be difficult in the wet with that [low downforce] rear wing that we had on the car.

“But even then I think we were still struggling a lot, and even also in the last few laps on the slick tyres were quite a handful to drive.

“[It was] just very difficult. A few things to look at of course, but we were no match anyway with the McLarens, and on the other hand when we have a difficult day we try to of course collect the points. To see Nico on that podium, for me at least, it's nice to see.”

In terms of what the approach would be going forward – after a weekend in which a strong Qualifying performance was followed by a tougher race day – Verstappen said: “Just go to the next one.

“We have nothing to lose, nothing to gain – we are not in the fight for the championships, so we tried to just… see every race as a one-off and try to maximise everything.”

Lewis Hamilton fought for a podium in the British Grand Prix but ultimately missed out by five seconds, with the Ferrari driver crossing the line in P4.

Lewis Hamilton assessed the British Grand Prix as a “difficult race”, with the seven-time World Champion admitting that his Ferrari had been a “very hard car to drive” in the mixed conditions at Silverstone.

After showing flashes of strong pace during the weekend, Hamilton lined up in P5 on the grid for his home race and suggested that he would not give up hope of a podium.

That dream very nearly came true as the 40-year-old found himself in fourth and chasing down third-placed Nico Hulkenberg in the latter stages of the Grand Prix, before ultimately missing out on the rostrum by just over five seconds.

Sharing his reflections after jumping out of the car, Hamilton said: “[It was a] difficult race, not a great one from my side. I did the best I could.

“As it showed there was plenty of mistakes out there and very, very tricky conditions, in really a very, very hard car to drive here – this car doesn't like those conditions. Not ideal, but we got some points at least.”

Hamilton's pace appeared to drop off slightly as he embarked on a second stint on the intermediate tyres before switching to the soft compound in the final phase.

Asked to summarise that segment of the race, he explained: “The tyres [were] dropping off, the car doesn't like low-speed corners, lots of understeer, and I started knocking out the left front and then just couldn't keep up.”

Despite the disappointment of missing out on a top-three result, Hamilton could still take the positives from racing in front of his home crowd.

“What I take from it is the amazing energy from all the fans,” the Briton said.

“They've been incredible this weekend and it's been amazing to see so many people switch to red and, yeah, got some points.”

George Russell and Kimi Antonelli reflect on their British Grand Prix experiences from a very wet Silverstone.

George Russell was left to rue a British Grand Prix where ""everything went wrong at every single point"", as Mercedes had a race to forget at Silverstone.

The Briton came home in 10th place on Sunday, having started fourth, as the Silver Arrows' gambles failed to pay off in a Grand Prix that saw a mid-race rain shower, two Virtual Safety Car periods and two full Safety Cars.

The first crucial call that backfired occurred before the lights had even gone out – Russell one of five drivers to pit at the end of the Formation Lap for slick tyres. But thanks to a first lap crash involving Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson, an immediate VSC period was called and that hampered Russell's attempts to keep his hard tyres up to temperature.

The Briton did start to make some progress back through the field as the rain fell, his Mercedes looking well balanced in the wet conditions, but then came a second call to move back to the hard tyre again as the track dried.

With Fernando Alonso having pitted for slicks half a lap before, it became apparent that Alonso was struggling and soon Russell was also in a similar position.

Once again he could not get the C2 rubber up to temperature and spun off into the gravel – fortunately keeping clear of the barriers. In the end he did hold onto P10 at the flag, which was a small consolation from a very disappointing Grand Prix.

“Everything just went wrong at every single point to be honest,” Russell explained. ""I feel at the beginning, pitting to slicks was not a stupid decision as we knew it was going to be dry for 25 minutes.

“But we had 15 minutes' worth of [Virtual] Safety Car and that didn't allow us to warm the tyres, it didn't allow us to [utilise] the gains of when it was dry. By the end of that stint, we were five seconds a lap faster than the wet runners.

“Then at the end maybe I called to pit one or two laps early, but I wasn't expecting the hard tyre and of course then it all just went wrong. Really disappointing day, if you play it safe, you'll come home with a safe result and that's not really what we were going for.”

Despite having a new set of mediums, Mercedes didn't fit those or any of the softs onto Russell's car – which Lance Stroll used to good effect in the early stages of the race. And, as Nico Hulkenberg showed with his run from P19 to third, there were big points available to anyone who made the right calls in a dramatic race.

“I think at the beginning with the information we had, it was totally justifiable but the call at the end was not right, that's on me,” Russell concluded.

""If you have a fast car, you can afford to do what you want, and you'll always find yourself in a good position. At the moment unfortunately we don't have that luxury.""

While Russell did at least see the chequered flag, the same couldn't be said for his team mate as Kimi Antonelli was rear-ended by the Racing Bulls car of Isack Hadjar when the visibility was at its worst midway through the race. Although Antonelli was able to limp back to the pits, the damage was too great and he retired the car.

“I mean the whole diffuser was gone so it was pretty undriveable the car, it was a shame,” the teenager said.

“I was just a passenger but I think Isack, he was also a passenger because he couldn't see until he was into my back. So yeah, just a shame to have ended with another DNF.”

Andrea Stella and Zak Brown react to McLaren's 1-2 after the British Grand Prix.

Andrea Stella and Zak Brown were both left with mixed feelings in the wake of the British Grand Prix after their McLaren drivers bagged another 1-2- result. While Lando Norris was over the moon to grab a first home victory, Oscar Piastri was left more disgruntled thanks to a mid-race penalty.

That 10-second time penalty ended up costing Piastri the win, the time he lost in the pits enough to jump Norris ahead after the Australian had led his team mate for much of the race.

While a 1-2 is still a dream result for the team, and extends McLaren's lead in the Championship to a mighty 238 points, the joy Team Principal Andrea Stella felt was slightly tempered by some frustration on behalf of Piastri.

“Both drivers drove very well, pretty much with no issues at all,” said Stella to Sky Sports F1 in the wake of a chaotic race in wet-dry conditions.

“Oscar very aggressive at the start, he gained the lead quite deservedly, then the penalty unfortunately meant he couldn't capitalise on a victory. This went to Lando.

“I'm sure for Lando this is a very, very special day, a win at the home Grand Prix. P1, P2 for McLaren so overall a very strong day, we are really happy, it is something we need to celebrate.”

“Couldn't be happier for Lando, couldn't be happier for the team, but disappointed for Oscar for sure, he drove an unbelievable race,” added McLaren's CEO Zak Brown.

Piastri's penalty was for braking behind the second Safety Car ahead of the restart, when he was trying to build a gap as the lead car. The stewards deemed him guilty of “erratic” braking and handed him a 10-second time penalty, which cost him the lead.

“We certainly gave our input to the Race Direction, especially related to the fact that we felt the Safety Car was called in relatively late,” Stella explained.

“This didn't give much space for the leading driver to take control of the group and go with the restarting procedure. So, we think overall the penalty was harsh… At the moment there is not much we can do, we just need to take it on the chin.

“A tough one for Oscar as he drove very well today, very well. But it is just the midseason, many more opportunities and I think this will give Oscar even more motivation.”

Brown was in full agreement, saying it looked “worse than it was,” before adding that these kinds of penalties always have “an element of subjectivity.”

Norris winning meant he cut into Piastri's Championship lead – which stood at 22 points just two races ago. Back-to-back victories for Norris has reduced that to just eight points at the midway point in the season.

“If we can continue to build a gap, we want it to be up to them to decide who wins the Championship,” added Brown.

“If it comes down to the two of them, may the best man win. And they are both very clean drivers, so that is what is cool, you don't feel like one is going to run one off the track. They'll fight hard, mistakes will happen along the way, but I think it's going to be an epic battle down to the final race.”

Yuki Tsunoda struggled in the changeable conditions at Silverstone on Sunday, coming home as the final finisher.

Yuki Tsunoda cut a downbeat figure following the British Grand Prix, describing his pace as “outstandingly slow” in the wet/dry conditions en route to 15th position.

Tsunoda showed some much-needed promise during Qualifying at Silverstone, with the Japanese driver pushing for a Q3 spot until a power issue hampered his final run and left him just outside the cut.

Starting the race from 11th, Tsunoda was hopeful of being in points contention amid the changeable weather, only to struggle throughout and eventually cross the line as the final finisher – a lap down on winner Lando Norris.

Tsunoda's afternoon included a clash with Haas rookie Ollie Bearman, which earned him a 10-second penalty and added insult to injury.

“I mean, it's quite clear with that collision,” he said afterwards. “Other than that, to be honest the pace was sadly very slow.

“When it comes to the long run, it's something that always is very outstandingly slow somehow. Just ‘degging' [the tyres] like crazy – I never had like this kind of feeling.

“I know we were running quite low downforce, but to be honest I had still good confidence in the rain. The rain pace was absolutely nowhere, so I'm a bit lost.”

Asked what he can take from the weekend, given his apparent progress before the race, Tsunoda added: “Yeah, a couple of positives from the dry conditions. On one lap it was pretty good, but yeah, the long run is something to look at more.”

In the other Red Bull, Max Verstappen started from pole position and came away with a fifth-place finish, having lost ground with a spin when a mid-race Safety Car period ended.

Red Bull's Max Verstappen held firm from pole position as the charging McLaren of Oscar Piastri chased him down at the race start for the British Grand Prix.

Polesitter Max Verstappen held off the McLarens of Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris during a chaotic start to the British Grand Prix.

With the Formation Lap at Silverstone starting behind the Safety Car, and the entire field on intermediate tyres, top-10 starters Charles Leclerc and George Russell dove into the pit lane to switch for slicks - along with the likes of Isack Hadjar, Gabriel Bortoleto and Ollie Bearman.

As the lights went out for the standing start, the cars that took to the grid launched off the line in the damp conditions with Verstappen holding off the charging McLaren duo behind him.

Later in the lap Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson was forced to retire after colliding with Haas' Esteban Ocon, with a Virtual Safety Car needing to be called upon.

The drivers and teams report back on all the action from Silverstone for the British Grand Prix.

Starting in the wet, Piastri managed to extract more grip from his inters than race-leader Verstappen could and picked off the Dutchman for the lead. After the leaders all pitted for fresh inters as the rain started to fall again, Piastri wound up with a huge 13s lead – only to lose that when a Safety Car came out. The papaya cars held position through the first restart, despite Norris putting Verstappen under huge pressure.

But at a second Safety Car restart, Piastri braked heavily, and Verstappen shot past him. The stewards decided that the Australian had not followed procedure and handed him a 10-second time penalty. At that point Norris was running second after Verstappen had spun and dropped back. Both McLarens pitted again after building a huge advantage over the field, Norris emerging ahead after Piastri served his penalty. That left the Brit to enjoy the last few laps before crossing the line to win his home race for the first time.

Lando Norris, 1st

“It was hard to imagine what this would be like – but it's everything I dreamed of, everything I've ever wanted to achieve. Aside from winning a Championship, I think this is as good as it gets in terms of feelings, in terms of achievement. It was an incredible race, but the support of the fans made the difference today. The last few laps, I was looking into the crowd, trying to take it all in and enjoy the moment. Shout out to my grandstand in the corner. They were amazing. They cheered me on every lap, and it was really a beautiful thing.

“As for the race itself, it was about as stressful as they can get. It's a long 52 laps, you never knew what was going to happen, especially when it was raining earlier. But the team made good decisions, we pitted at the right times and got an amazing result. Thank you to the team for their incredible work - these are memories I'll have forever.”

Oscar Piastri, 2nd

“Today didn't end how I wanted it to for me but well done to the team on a really successful day. A 1-2 at our home Grand Prix is brilliant and it's a great chunk of points for us. Whilst it was a frustrating one for me with the penalty, we had a rocket ship of a car, so thank you to the team for all their work which meant we could pull such a gap over the rest of the field. I'll use the frustration of today to fuel us further at the next weekend, but for now, we can reflect on a great weekend for McLaren.”

Andrea Stella, Team Principal

“We leave our home race with a 1-2 and a win at home for Lando, which is a fantastic result and a great reward for the hard-working men and women of McLaren, many of whom were in the stands to witness this achievement. With that said, the race was not a simple one, with changeable conditions and a penalty for Oscar which was difficult to take. We will look at that over the coming days and work to understand what could have been done differently. Oscar drove a fantastic race and made a great move for the lead of the race, and the team did well to calmly execute in difficult conditions. 

“On Lando's side, he executed an excellent race. His pace was quick throughout the race, and we're pleased to have been able to win this special British Grand Prix with him. Our focus now turns to the final two races before the summer break, where we will look to score more wins and podiums.

“Thank you to all of the fans in the grandstands and events we've attended this week. Your support drives us forward and motivates us to keep pushing in this fascinating and exciting season of Formula 1.”

Hulkenberg started last on the grid in P19, with Colapinto starting from the pit lane. But thanks to timing his first pit stop to perfection and staying on the inters, he jumped up into the top 10. From there he didn't put a foot wrong, picking off Stroll for P3 and then making the switch to medium tyres on the perfect lap. He had to hold off a charging Hamilton, but was able to as the German recorded his first ever F1 podium after 239 Grand Prix starts. That result brought plenty of joy to the paddock, with everyone pleased to see Hulkenberg on the rostrum.

Bortoleto wasn't so fortunate. He swapped to the mediums at the end of the Formation Lap but as the rain fell, he lost temperature and spun off. He did manage to get back to the track but was forced to park up with pieces of his rear wing hanging off.

Nico Hulkenberg, 3rd

""I am ecstatic — this is such a special day for the team and for me personally. That first podium feeling... I cannot put it into words. It was such an intense race with changing conditions all the time, and you always feel like you are right on the edge.

“We made the right calls today, especially stopping later for slicks — that decision was crucial and made all the difference. The battle with Lewis in the final stint was really intense. He was closing the gap, but I managed to keep him behind and even pull away a little as the tyres came in. I think if it had been a dry race, the day would have looked very different for us, but we made the most of the conditions and took every opportunity.

“Starting from last on the grid and finishing on the podium honestly feels kind of surreal. It's going to take a few days, a few moments, to process everything and take it all in. It's been a great team effort from start to finish, and I am really proud of what we achieved together. Now, we have two weeks to enjoy this and celebrate properly before we get back to work – and finish the first half of the season on a high.""

Gabriel Bortoleto, DNF

""First of all, congratulations to Nico! Seeing him fight for the podium and achieve this result after so many years in Formula One means a lot. He is the best teammate I have ever worked with — both as a driver and as a person — and he absolutely deserves this moment: I am genuinely happy for him. It's a special day for the team and, even though my own race didn't go to plan, I am proud to be part of this. I'll keep working hard and hopefully be up there as well someday. Looking back at how the race went for me, I am rather disappointed: I took a risk by switching to the medium tyre, expecting the track to dry quicker with the conditions we had but, unfortunately, it didn't go the way I hoped. I pushed on the restart, lost the car, and that was the end of my race, on top of an already challenging weekend. I am always very self-critical and I know I let the team down today, because we had the potential for an even stronger result. But these things are all part of the learning curve. Now, we'll celebrate Nico and head into a couple of weeks without racing, which we'll use to keep training and working on improving even more ahead of the summer break.”

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal

“Where do I start… The most overdue podium in F1 history and the first podium for the team since Japan in 2012. This was a weekend of highs and lows but ultimately, we pulled it all together and when the opportunity was there, we grabbed it with both hands. After his success in Austria this was a frustrating weekend for Gabriel, but he grows stronger with every race. Easy to forget that this is still only his first season in F1 and I know he will be eager to get back on track and start the second half of the championship.

“Nico drove a masterclass today. From starting in 19th to P3 this was the lowest ever starting position for a podium finisher in Sauber's 32-year history and after 239 Grand Prix starts, Nico delivered the goods. No driver is more deserving of a podium than Nico.

“Once again, we came together as a team today. We showed confidence and belief in ourselves, delivering a result that everyone in the factory and at the track can be justly proud of. What a day.”

With a drying track, Leclerc opted to come in at the end of the Formation Lap for medium tyres. But it was the wrong call, and he struggled down the order. Hamilton stayed out on the inters, but he was also struggling, with the Ferrari not looking very switched on in the wet. Leclerc's day never really improved as he ran off twice to come home 14th, but Hamilton's afternoon did see some positives. He lost a few places with the timing of his pit stops, but once the track started to dry, he was fast. However, Hamilton's inters didn't last, meaning a less than optimum final stop for the slicks. Stopping one lap too early cost him, and he didn't have time to chase down Hulkenberg for a podium.

Charles Leclerc, 14th

""It was a really tough race from start to finish. In retrospect, my decision to stop on the formation lap for slicks was not the right one, but I don't think it changed much because our pace just wasn't there today. I went quite extreme with the set-up on my car for the last few races, and it paid off in the dry. However, in the conditions we saw here today, it didn't seem to work as well. There is a lot of work ahead of us.

""Congratulations to Nico for his podium, it's a great achievement for him and his team.""

Lewis Hamilton, 4th

""Not the result we were hoping for today but we're continuing to grow as a team and I'm also getting more in tune with the car. Third place felt within reach at times but credit to Nico on his first podium, he drove a strong race. Silverstone always puts on a great show and the changing weather definitely made things interesting. Big thanks to the amazing crowd for all the support this weekend, it is always great to be home.""

Fred Vasseur, Team Principal

""That was a chaotic race for everyone from start to finish. I can imagine for the fans it was a good one. The conditions were changing so frequently that it was difficult to be on the right tyre at the right moment. The many Safety Cars also meant it was very difficult to predict what would come next. At the end of the race, you always feel you could have done much better in terms of strategy.

""Charles' gamble to switch immediately to slicks was a brave call and, if things had gone differently, it could have been the right one. Clearly, McLaren were much faster than us, but today we scored more points than Mercedes and Red Bull, which is positive, as is the fact that we were competitive all the way up to the final run in Q3, that our pace has improved considerably compared to earlier in the year and now we need to carry that performance level into the second half of the season.

""We will study this weekend's data to see why we struggled where we did. Now, the most important thing is that we make a further step forward in performance at the next race in Spa, that we put everything together to ensure we have a perfect weekend from start to finish.

""Finally, congratulations to Nico on his first podium. Given his undoubted talent, he deserves it.""

Verstappen led off the line but was very much struggling in a car set-up to be fast down the straights. That lack of downforce cost him in the wet, and he lost the lead to Piastri and looked close to being picked off by Norris. But worse was to come when he spun at the second Safety Car restart, and then ran wide trying to recover. He dropped to P10 and after a spell stuck behind Sainz, managed to climb back to fifth at the flag. As for Tsunoda, he was in the thick of the action down the order. He was handed a 10-second time penalty for tagging Bearman into a spin, and wound up coming home last of the runners.

Max Verstappen, 5th

“Today wasn't great. We didn't think it was going to be so wet today; the weather forecast overnight changed and it was not in our favour, so it was really difficult with the rear wing that we had today. Every time we were low on downforce and couldn't balance it out in the high and low speed, with the tools that we had. Of course, I had the spin and we lost a lot of positions at the restart. I don't really know what happened as I tried to go on the throttle, but we recovered it as much as we could to get to P5. Even after that happened, I continued and the car had no pace which wasn't great. From a positive side, we got our strategy right and did the right thing with the pit stop and staying on the inters. All the calls were correct but the inters just lacked a bit of pace. That is racing though, we will never be happy with fifth, but we move on to the next race. The race wasn't that enjoyable for me but it was nice to see Nico get his first podium and I'm sure he will be celebrating tonight. Spa is next and my favourite on the calendar, so hopefully we will go a bit better there.”

Yuki Tsunoda, 15th

“It was not easy out there at all today but somehow it was not really that messy a race for myself. I just struggled with the pace a lot and even in the dry I didn't have great pace. The rain and the conditions were the main issue today and then I had massive deg on the tyres, as usual. The incident with Ollie was really tricky, the touch itself was very light and in those conditions, it can have massive consequences. I found him to say sorry immediately after the race. In terms of short runs, I have a couple of positives to take away from this weekend but on the long runs, somehow, I just deg like crazy. I had good confidence in the rain so we need to look into why I couldn't find the pace. The downforce may have contributed but it's much more than that, we were still slower than we should have been. The car should be different for Belgium, and we will go away and work hard in the time we have off until then.”

Christian Horner, Team Principal

“Well, the race was exciting, it always is in those conditions. For us, we took a bit of a gamble with the weather, expecting a dry race and obviously when you have very low downforce in those conditions it is next to impossible. I think Max did really well, he stuck with it and he got unlucky at the restart. I'm not sure what happened with Oscar, but it put Max on the wrong part of the track and then he had the spin which put him down in the order. Once the circuit started to dry up, he managed to pick his way through the pack and it was a good recovery to P5. For Yuki, again it was a tough race. He couldn't get the pace and then the penalty, once again, left him in a hole that was unrecoverable. Not the result we were looking for but well done today to Nico Hulkenberg for finally making it onto the podium.”

Colapinto's race was over before it started, with the Argentine stalling as he pulled into the Alpine pit box – where he was due to start after the team opted to change his power unit overnight. But Gasly had a great getaway and was in the thick of the top 10. He jumped Hamilton in the pit stops, and managed to hold the Ferrari at bay for a number of laps. While he lost out to Hamilton and Verstappen late on, Gasly picked off Stroll on the last lap to record his best finish of the season.

Pierre Gasly, 6th

“It is an incredible result for the whole team to finish in sixth place. I don't think we expected to be in that position after our Practice sessions, so credit to everyone for their effort this weekend. It's made even more sweet that it's at Silverstone, the home race for Enstone, with so many staff members here watching in the grandstands. It's a great boost of motivation for everyone, so I am very happy. We had some nice on track battles with drivers we don't normally fight with like Fernando [Alonso], Lewis [Hamilton] and Max [Verstappen], so that was fun. It was all about judging the risk and we just tried to go for it. We took the risks and it paid off with the right strategy calls and great pit-stops. I am looking forward to being at the factory this week to continue the hard work and hopefully seeing some smiles tomorrow morning!”

Franco Colapinto, DNS

“I was really looking forward to today's race, so it was disappointing not to be able to get out there and try to make up for the result yesterday in conditions that opened up a lot of opportunities. It was not clear what the issue was at the time, which took some time to investigate during the race. All I know is that I could not pull away from the box. We tried a few things to get going again, but in the end, we had to retire the car. As a racer, days like today are when you want to be out there and as we have seen from the others starting further back there were possibilities to make big gains today. It was a good weekend in terms of learnings which we can take into the next races. I followed the race as it unfolded. It was an exciting one and well done to Pierre and the team for scoring points at our home race. With two weeks between races, we will now go back to Enstone and work hard for the final push before the summer break.”

Flavio Briatore, Executive Advisor

“It is a good result today for the team and a great drive by Pierre in difficult conditions. It is nice to score points at the team's home race, which is good for the whole team and the morale after some difficult races. With how we started the weekend, points didn't look possible, so well done to the team for turning it around. It's a pity about Franco's race, which ended before it even started after suffering a driveline issue. We have made up ground on Haas, RB, and Williams, while others have pulled away. The result from our rivals also gives us hope we can do the same and we will continue to push to improve on our position.”

Alonso was left frustrated after losing a handful of places when the rain arrived, despite Aston Martin putting the Spaniard on the same strategy as the leaders. His mood likely wasn't helped by the fact his team mate had jumped ahead from p17 on the grid – Stroll pitting for softs after a handful of laps, making up enough time on that compound to then pit back onto the inters and emerge in fourth.

Second time around, Alonso was the one to gamble, the first to switch back to the slicks after the mid-race rain. But it was too early and he lost a chunk of time, doing well to recover back to the points. As for Stroll, he was holding onto third for a long time, but found himself overtaken by faster cars in the last few laps.

Fernando Alonso, 9th

""I feel like it was a missed opportunity today despite scoring some points. It was difficult to read with the rain falling again and we lost some positions in the first pit-stop. For the second pit-stop we pitted too soon and I lost a lot of time on a slightly damp track with slick tyres. We had some good pace but in the end we weren't able to capitalise on an eventful race. I am very happy for Nico [Hulkenberg] to score his first podium and I hope he enjoys the celebrations.""

Lance Stroll, 7th

""Very mixed weekend for us at Silverstone – we showed some decent pace during Practice on Friday, which unfortunately we couldn't build on during Qualifying and started from the back today. The team made some good strategy calls during the race and overall a good result. I really struggled with tyre degradation and unfortunately we weren't in a position where we could fight for more. [Nico] Hulkenberg had a lot more grip during that last stint and with the level of degradation we got the best possible result today.""

Andy Cowell, Team Principal

""It was an intense and challenging afternoon in Silverstone with Lance and Fernando battling hard to score eight points between them [Lance P7 and Fernando P9]. We were fighting at the front, but our pace dropped off as the DRS was enabled and the track continued to dry. We probably switched Fernando to the dry tyres a bit too early, but he managed to recover to the points. Lance drove very well today: he didn't put a wheel out of place. Given the pace of the car, P7 is a great result. In these rainy races, you often reflect and see opportunities where you could have done things differently – and most teams probably feel the same – but we can be pleased to get both cars in the points at our home race.""

Albon was running third at one stage, opting not to come in for fresh inters as the rain fell. That cost him as he tumbled down the order when he did make it in. He found himself behind his team mate as the two were fighting Leclerc, who pulled a risky move on Sainz to climb ahead before dropping back. But the team picked the right lap to pit Albon on for the last set of slicks, and that helped him stay in the top 10 – and he picked off Alonso on the last lap for good measure. Sainz was not so fortunate, coming home outside the points.

Alex Albon, 8th

""I'm happy with our race today. We got the balance right between risky and safe, and bounced back from a tricky day yesterday. Towards the end of the race, we had really good pace, good rhythm, and managed to get Alonso on the last lap. I loved the conditions, where the racing line is so small and there's no room for mistakes. Looking to the next race, we collected a lot of useful data this weekend, which will help us get on top of the issues before Spa.""

Carlos Sainz, 12th

""I had a good race, keeping out of trouble, managing the tyres and had good pace. Unfortunately, towards the end and on slick tyres, I was about to overtake Charles, but he lost the car into Turn 15, came across the track and hit my front wing and front floor. We both went off, losing a lot of positions and I had a damaged car until the end of the race. It seems to be the story of my season so far and it's very annoying that different issues continue to impact our weekends. I'm driving well and I know better days will come, but it's frustrating at this point. I'm looking forward to the two-week reset and hopefully we can have a better second half of the season. Massive thanks to every Williams fan out there this weekend! Your support has been amazing! Thank you.""

James Vowles, Team Principal

""Firstly, congratulations to Sauber and to Nico - an extraordinary result today and well-earned in these difficult conditions. For us, we didn't expect it to stay as wet for that duration. The car was set up more for a dry race and you could see that. In Inter conditions and even when it was drying, we were poor. We were taken by Aston Martin and dropped back, but at the end of the race, Alex was flying and able to climb back, which shows the swing in our performance. We also didn't get the second Intermediate call right and that cost us many seconds. For Carlos, he did everything right, but it was out of his control when a Ferrari spun in front of him and he had to avoid it. It's a tough reflection on today - I was hoping for more points.

""Now we go to Spa, where we've got an update coming that should give us a bit of an edge and help us fight back in that very tight midfield battle. Spa, like Silverstone, has tended to suit our car in the past, so let's reset and come back fighting. We have the pace to score points from here to the end of the year.""

Mercedes had a good car for the conditions, but didn't manage to get their strategy calls right. Russell stopped on the Formation Lap for slicks, but it was too early. Antonelli stayed on the inters but then moved to the slicks very early too. As the rain started to fall, both had to come in for inters and found themselves down the order having pitted twice. Antonelli's day got worse when he was rear-ended by an unsighted Hadjar in the heavy spray, and while he tried to continue, the damage to his rear diffuser was too great. As for Russell, he opted to switch back to the slicks too early and ran across the gravel. Somehow at the end of a very eventful day, he grabbed the final point.

George Russell, 10th

""It's always difficult making the right calls in conditions like today but sadly, we didn't manage to do that. We opted to go to the Hard tyre after the formation lap and we then had a 25-minute window of dry weather, which should have enabled us to put them to good use. Unfortunately, we had 15-minutes of Virtual Safety Car running. Once we were running, we were seconds a lap quicker than others but just had too much time to make up.

""We were then a few laps too early pitting back to the slick tyre after the track had dried once again. We put on the Hard tyre and suffered with warm-up issues. I spun and lost ground; we were fortunate to be able to fight back to P10 but overall, that was a bad day and not how I wanted my home race to go. We will look to learn from this and ensure we come back stronger before the summer break.""

Kimi Antonelli, DNF

""That was a tough day. I wasn't sure about stopping for the Hard tyre in the opening laps, but we made the call. Sadly, the Virtual Safety Car came out shortly afterwards and I couldn't build any temperature in the tyre. I struggled once we were back underway to generate the necessary heat and that left me unable to utilise any pace advantage we may have had as the track dried.

""Once the rain hit, the conditions became treacherous. Even once the Safety Car had come back in, visibility was still very poor and there was lots of standing water. That is what caught out Hadjar and that was just unfortunate for the both of us. I tried to continue but the diffuser damage I suffered was too much and we had to retire the car. A weekend to forget then but we will look to come back stronger in Spa.""

Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport

""We are all in this together and that was a poor performance all around from us today. We made successive decisions which weren't right, and we will be evaluating what we did, when, and why, to ensure we improve from this. We have to take this result on the chin but must make sure we do not repeat the errors we made today.

""The first call to take the slick tyre on the formation lap was wrong. From there, we spiralled from bad to worse. We didn't opt to split strategies and, if we had, Kimi's race may have been different. He was unfortunate to suffer race ending damage after the Safety Car but he shouldn't have been back in the pack and at risk of that. We didn't fit the right dry tyre at either stop, opting for the Hard compound which suffered a challenging warm-up. All in all, that was a tough day and we need to bounce back in the final two races before the summer break.""

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director

""This was a very disappointing day for the team and a difficult end to a tough double-header. After starting P4 and P10, scoring a solitary point is significantly below our own expectations. George's race was shaped by the decision to take the dry tyre on the formation lap - it was a bit of a gamble, in hindsight a mistake, and it left us on the back foot for the rest of the race.

""George drove strongly to recover ground on the first two stints, but when it came to the final stop, we aimed to leapfrog Gasly by stopping for dry tyres. We overestimated how ready the circuit was for them, however. George lost a lot of time as a result, including a spin through Becketts, and was only able to salvage a single point at the flag.

""As for Kimi, we mirrored George's call for dry tyres after two laps, sacrificing track position as a result, and he was then blameless in the collision with Hadjar in the spray. This caused significant damage to the diffuser, and we took the decision to retire the car consequently. There is much for us to analyse and learn from today, and it is imperative that we do that work, regroup and deliver a much stronger weekend in three weeks' time in Spa.""

Ocon found himself squeezed at the start, stuck between Tsunoda and Lawson. He had contact with the latter, which left him at the back of the intermediate-shod cars. His team mate was further back, Bearman opting to chuck on some hard tyres at the end of the Formation Lap. That was the wrong decision, and Bearman's afternoon was made harder when Tsunoda tagged him into a spin. Then it got even worse when he tried to overtake Ocon and the two made contact, both spinning in unison. Somehow, Bearman came close to the points – within DRS range of Russell ahead in the closing stages. But it was not to be, and Haas failed to score.

Esteban Ocon, 13th

“It was an extremely frustrating race. From the beginning when I was in the middle of two cars, I thought there was going to be contact and as soon as I saw, I backed off but there wasn't room for three cars. I glad everyone was okay and it was a miracle my car was fine, and after that we made all the right choices though we didn't box for a new set of inters. That slipped through our hands and it's not usually something that happens to me. The thing that happened with Ollie at the end I'm sad about – I'm sad for the team as well – as we both deserved more from today, we deserved to be in the points from where we came from, so we'll review to improve.”

Oliver Bearman, 11th

“It was a tough race. We switched to slicks in the early laps – in hindsight, that wasn't the right choice with the rain coming, and we lost a lot of time throughout the race. I got tapped and spun around at one stage, but even with all that, we were P11 and fighting for the points, so it's a real shame. We've been so fast this weekend and it's just disappointing to end like that. They were tough conditions out there, and there's only one racing line so I couldn't overtake Russell at the end. The positives were that the car was fast, and I feel really confident with car balance and the step that the car has taken.""

Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal

“I can't hide away from the fact that we executed a terrible race today, we have to be better. In terms of machinery, I think we have a good car now and it's really competitive. Whether it's competitive everywhere I don't know, but in Silverstone with the upgrade – all credit to the team that made this happen – we have a strong car, and we've proved that. Today, however, we didn't do justice to the car or the team, so there's a lot to learn from as a group. It's not just today, as a whole we need to focus on how we get a clean weekend together; we shouldn't be starting from P14 and P18 where we're then trying to force the result. We need to focus on executing three clean days on a race weekend and getting the result that our car deserves.

“On the incident with Ollie and Esteban today, well, our drivers' touching is the last thing that should happen – but I looked at the onboard of both drivers, I spoke with them both, and for me it was a racing incident. Again though, if you look at how they ended up in that situation, the pit stop timings for that stop were correct, so we pitted the lead car first. Ollie then went off in a high-speed corner, and that's why he was behind his team-mate when Esteban came out after his stop. As Ollie had hotter tyres than Esteban, we went for the overtake, but we shouldn't have been in that position to start with. It just shouldn't happen, and when they had different speeds or strategies, we've been swapping them over, and they're complete team players – they don't argue, and they do the job straight away. It's a racing incident, but we'll make sure it doesn't happen again.”

Lawson's day ended at a very early stage, on the outside on the opening lap he collided with Ocon in a typical first lap racing incident. That ended his afternoon, and caused the first VSC. Hadjar was one of a gaggle to pit for slicks at the end of the Formation Lap, so had already lost a handful of places. But as the rain intensified, he suddenly found himself right on the tail of Antonelli's Mercedes. He slammed on the brakes but it was too late and the two collided, with Hadjar parking up immediately as the team recorded a double DNF for the first time this season.

Isack Hadjar, DNF

""Racing in these tough conditions means that it's always a little bit of a gamble out there. At the start of the race, I was following Charles and it seemed we had a good pace; we were on the same strategy, but it wasn't the right one. During the laps we spent behind the Safety Car, I couldn't see much due to the heavy rain and the tyre temperature dropped. After the restart, I wish I could have maybe had a bit more margin, but when I saw the red light of the back of Kimi's car, it was already too late as there was just zero visibility. Thankfully, I'm okay. Now we reset, and I'm already looking forward to racing in Spa in a couple of weeks.”

Liam Lawson, DNF

“Unfortunately, our race ended early due to a racing incident. We made the right call on tyres and had a strong start, so it's a shame we couldn't show the car's full potential. I think we had a really good car today, especially suited to the mixed conditions. It was a race full of opportunity, and we missed out on some big points. Looking ahead to Spa in a few weeks, we're aiming for another weekend in the points, it'll be another special one in an F1 car.""

Laurent Mekies, Team Principal

“To start with the most important thing, both Liam and Isack are okay, they escaped the accidents they had unhurt. There is never a good day to lose both cars in crashes, but it is what it is; today was not a good day for that. What matters is that we have a strong car, strong drivers and we were fast again this weekend. However we do leave here with 0 points and we will be working very hard to improve on the few things that have derailed our weekend. We will be regrouping, preparing for Spa and turning up trying to use the pace of the car that we are confident we have. It might not have been the result we wanted to leave Silverstone with, but the hard work and team spirit in both Faenza and Milton Keynes is very high and I'd like to thank everyone for pushing to unlock the next steps together.”

Mario Isola, Motorsport Director

“It's hard to imagine a better way to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Formula 1 than the weekend we have just witnessed. I reckon the half a million people who came to Silverstone over the four days had a great time, despite today's rain not making life easy for the spectators! Yesterday's qualifying was unpredictable and so too was today's race. Congratulations to McLaren for the one-two and to Nico Hulkenberg for his very first Formula 1 podium. It was unexpected but totally well deserved!

“For our part, on the technical front, just as happened here last year, four of the five types of tyre available came into play. It's a shame we didn't see the Extreme Wet in action, because it would have been interesting to gauge its performance level compared to the Intermediate, the compound that really shone today, proving to be competitive when there was a lot of standing water on track, as well as when the track was drying in the final stages of the race. Obviously, there was graining and significant wear, both down to the track conditions, but the drivers were able to control tyre use based on how the race unfolded.

“Our work at Silverstone is not yet over. On Tuesday and Wednesday, we will back on track, working with Sauber and Aston Martin in a development test session for the 2026 tyres. Gabriel Bortoleto will be behind the wheel for the Swiss team on both days, while Lance Stroll and Felipe Drugovich will share driving duties for the team based just a stone's throw from the circuit.""

2025 British Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Oscar Piastri voiced his unhappiness at the 10-second time penalty he received during the British Grand Prix, the Australian ending the race in second after earlier leading.

Oscar Piastri has rued the impact of a “pretty bad” 10-second time penalty on his race at the British Grand Prix, with the McLaren driver feeling that he did not get the result he “deserved”.

After starting from P2, Piastri had got himself into the lead of what proved to be a highly eventful wet-dry race at Silverstone, holding onto that position through two Safety Car periods.

However, when the second phase came to an end, Piastri was deemed by the stewards to have braked too late at the restart, resulting in him being handed a 10-second penalty which he later served during a pit stop.

This dropped the Australian down to second, while team mate Lando Norris took victory and brought Piastri's championship lead down to just eight points. Nico Hulkenberg, meanwhile, claimed a debut F1 podium in third.

During his initial post-race interview, Piastri was reluctant to comment on what happened as he said: “I'm not going to say much, I'll get myself in trouble. Well done to Nico – I think that's the highlight of the day. I'll leave it there.""

He added: “Apparently you can't brake behind the Safety Car anymore. I did it for five laps before that and, again, I'm not going to say too much because I'll get myself in trouble.

“But thanks to the crowd for a great event, thanks for sticking through the weather. I still like Silverstone even if I don't like it today. Thanks for coming out everyone.”

When speaking to media later on, the 24-year-old gave a further insight into his feelings about what had happened.

“I thought the penalty was pretty bad but, anyway, I'm glad we had a quick car today, showed what I needed to prove, and it's just disappointing when what you deserve gets taken from you, but that's how it goes,” said Piastri.

“I hit the brakes, saw the Safety Car lights went off so I didn't accelerate again, and Max [Verstappen] went past me which was a bit strange, and then I got a penalty for it so about as simple as that.”

Pushed on what he would take from the weekend as a whole, Piastri responded: “The pace was good, I did everything I needed to, just didn't get the result I deserved.”

The F1 Nation crew review all the stories from an eventful British Grand Prix at Silverstone.

Mercedes Reserve driver Fred Vesti and Fox Sports Mexico journalist Diego Mejia join F1 Nation host Tom Clarkson in the Silverstone paddock to reflect on an action-packed British Grand Prix.

Lando Norris won his home race for the very first time to reduce the gap to his team mate and World Championship leader Oscar Piastri to eight points. What does that victory mean for Norris and how much momentum does winning back-to-back races give him?

And, after a 10-second penalty for a Safety Car infringement cost Piastri a chance of winning, how will the Australian approach the next race?

But there was also plenty of joy, praise and credit for Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg, who made history by securing the first podium of his F1 career in his 15th season and on his 239th race start.

How did he climb from last on the grid to take P3 and hold off a charging Lewis Hamilton? Sauber Team Principal Jonathan Wheatley and CEO Mattia Binotto reflect on a ‘masterclass' drive and what this result means for Hulkenberg and the team.

Also on the agenda in F1 Nation's review of the weekend: why wasn't Hamilton able to continue his incredible run of being on the podium at every British Grand Prix since 2014? And how did Max Verstappen go from a sensational pole position on Saturday to having an ‘undriveable car' in the wet conditions on Sunday?

Netflix doubled down on its global anime strategy over the weekend, unveiling a slate of new titles and fresh footage during its showcase at Anime Expo in Los Angeles. The company also shared updated viewership data highlighting just how far Japanese anime has come in expanding from its former niche into a powerhouse global content category. 


	According to Netflix, more than 50 percent of its members — amounting to over 150 million households, or an estimated 300 million viewers — now watch anime. The company says anime viewership on the platform has tripled over the past five years, with 2024 marking a record-breaking year: 33 anime titles appeared in Netflix's Global Top 10 (Non-English) rankings, more than double the number in 2021.

The seventh installment in the action-adventure series created by Steven Spielberg opened well ahead of expectations over the long Fourth of July holiday in the U.S. — where it racked up $147.8 million — as well as overseas. 


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	The dinos have a new lease on life.


	Universal and Amblin's Jurassic World Rebirth came in well ahead of expectations at the Fourth of July box office to hatch a new era for the Steven Spielberg-created franchise. In North America, the holiday tentpole is reporting a five-day domestic opening of $147.8 million, including $92 million for the three-day weekend, according to final numbers. (Estimates were revised upward every day since the pic hit the big screen midweek on July 2.)




Jurassic World Rebirth, the seventh title in the series, is roaring even louder overseas, where it opened to an estimated $174.8 million from 82 markets. That puts the film's global start at $322.6 million — the second-best launch of the franchise, and the biggest worldwide opening of the year to date for a Hollywood release after passing up A Minecraft Movie. No one saw that coming.

	Internationally, Rebirth scored the second-best international opening of the year and of the franchise. It even bit off a big number in China, where Hollywood tentpoles can no longer depend upon big grosses. The dino franchise, like the Mission: Impossible films, is an exception. Rebirth debuted to $41.5 million to score the biggest opening of the year so far for a Hollywood title. And it already ranks as the second-biggest Hollywood pic of the year behind Mission: Impossible – the Final Reckoning. Other top markets included the U.K. ($16.6 million) and Mexico ($14 million).

	











	In North America, Rebirth ranks as the fourth-best showing ever for the July Fourth holiday, both in terms of the five-day and three-day numbers. That's no small feat considering July 4 fell on a Friday this year, meaning many moviegoers were distracted by holiday outings on what's normally a critical day for new films.


	To boot, the latest Jurassic World pic has received decidedly mixed reviews from both critics and audiences alike (one example: it earned a meh B CinemaScore from moviegoers). But there's no dismissing the power of the Jurassic brand, or the spectacle of seeing dinosaurs come to life on the big screen. “It's the definition of a popcorn movie,” is one common refrain making the rounds in Hollywood. Another? “It's dumb fun.”


	Heading into the holiday, the pic was eyeing a far more modest domestic opening in the $100 to $120 million range and $260 million globally, considering it was a reboot and the seventh installment in a series more than 30 years old.


	Following the conclusion of the Jurassic World trilogy directed by Colin Trevorrow, Spielberg, Amblin and Universal, they went back to the drawing board and enlisted filmmaker Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) to direct Rebirth from a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp. If all goes well, it will be the first title in another trilogy, according to insiders.


	The film features an all-new cast anchored by Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali and Jonathan Bailey. The story follows an extraction team that races to an island research facility that factored into the original Jurassic Park (along the way, they discover a shipwrecked family). Now, the island is inhabited by the worst of the worst creatures that were left behind.Rupert Friend, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Luna Blaise, David Iacono and Audrina Miranda also star. Producers include longtime franchise stewards Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, with Spielberg and Denis Stewart exec producing.

	











	The first three Jurassic World pics all grossed north of $1 billion globally, and all opened higher than Rebirth domestically (comparisons are complicated by the fact that those were all three-day, non-holiday openings). In 2015, Jurassic World opened to a franchise-best $208.8 million, followed by $148 million for 2018's Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and $145 million for 2022's Jurassic World: Dominion, not adjusted for inflation. At the same time, the latest film cost less to produce, or a net $180 million before marketing.


	The first Jurassic Park, directed by Spielberg, opened to $47 million domestically in early June 1993, not adjusted for inflation — a huge sum at the time.


	Also setting off fireworks at the box office was Brad Pitt's F1: The Movie, which has already earned nearly $300 million globally, including a 10-day domestic tally of $109.2million.


	From Apple Original Films in partnership with Warner Bros., F1 came in second over the holiday weekend with an estimated three-day gross of $25.7 million. Overseas, it racked up another $56.3 million for a foreign cume of $184.1 million and $293.3 million globally.


	The movie, reteaming Top Gun: Maverick director Joseph Kosinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer, is a critical and audience darling and fell just 54 percent in its second outing. The film is enjoying a major boost from having a lock on Imax screens for three weekends. 


	Universal was a double winner at the holiday box office as DreamWorks Animation's live-action How to Train Your Dragon came in third place with an estimated $11 million for a domestic tally of $224 million. Globally, it set off fireworks in clearing the $500 million milestone after amassing a foreign haul of $292.9 million. 

	











	Pixar and Disney's troubled pic Elio came in fourth with an estimated $5.7 million for a muted domestic tally of $55.1 million. Overseas, it earned another $6.7 million for a foreign tally of $41.7 million and $96.8 million globally.


	Danny Boyle and Sony's 28 Years Later rounded out the top five domestically with $4.6 million for a domestic haul of $60.2 million. The sequel grossed another $7 million at the international box office for a foreign total of $65.6 million and $125.8 million globally.


Blumhouse and Atomic Monster's ill-fated M3GAN 2.0 fell off somewhat less than expected, or 62 percent, in its second weekend to an estimated $3.8 million after bombing in its debut a week ago. The Universal releases tied for sixth place with Disney's live-action Lilo & Stitch, which is likewise reporting a three-day gross of $3.8 million.


Lilo & Stitch made major headlines in passing up A Minecraft Movie to become the top-earning pic of 2025 at the worldwide box office after finishing Sunday with a global total of $972.7 million. It remains to be seen whether the Memorial Day release can become the first Hollywood title of the year to join the billion-dollar club. 


	Elsewhere on the top 10 chart, fellow Memorial Day release Mission: Impossible: The Final Reckoning finished Sunday with a global haul of $576.2 million.

""I don't want her to lose anything, ever. I feel very married to what Charlotte wants,"" Kristin Davis tells THR about season three of the 'Sex and the City' sequel series.


							By 

	Jackie Strause


Managing Editor, East Coast


[This story contains spoilers from the fifth and sixth episodes of And Just Like That season three.]


	During the June 26 episode of And Just Like That, Charlotte's (Kristin Davis) husband Harry (Evan Handler) told her that he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. 




	Though Harry assured Charlotte that everything is going to be OK, Charlotte can't help but worry. She quickly goes into overdrive, throwing all of her energy into doing what she can to support her soulmate, all the while keeping the news quiet from their children and her girlfriends.

	The plot sparks déjà vu for And Just Like That viewers, since the Sex and the City sequel series famously killed off the show's First Husband, Big (Chris Noth), when protagonist Carrie Bradshaw's (Sarah Jessica Parker) partner suddenly dropped dead of a heart attack to kick off the grief-heavy first season of the HBO Max continuation show. (Noth was going to have a cameo in the finale of that season, but the appearance was scrapped after he was accused of sexual assault.)


	This time around, with the series now in season three, the actor who plays Harry assured fans that the husband who hails from the original series is likely not being killed off. “I don't think the show is going to go in the direction of delving deeply into Harry's medical journey,” Handler said recently in an interview with CNN. “It's going to be more about, how does this affect a couple? How does this affect a woman whose partner has asked her not to tell anyone? What are the implications for a relationship when someone makes a request like that, which is reasonable on his part, but may be untenable for — for the partner.”

	











	Handler, who himself was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at the age of 24, added, “These are the things that come up, just as all kinds of things come up in any long term relationship. And I think that's what the show means to explore, is those kinds of things for the people who have watched these characters for so long.”


	Davis spoke briefly to The Hollywood Reporter about Harry's health revelation and she agreed with Handler when it comes to how the news will impact the most steady couple of the Michael Patrick King-steered franchise. Sex and the City viewers will recall Charlotte's reaction from the first movie when, after Big jilted Carrie at their wedding, Charlotte confided in Carrie that she worries that her too-perfect life will come crashing down one day. In the more recent sixth episode, Charlotte breaks down to Carrie in a drugstore aisle, leading her to confess to her friend, “I can't stop thinking that he's going to die.” 


	“You're so right,” Davis told THR when reminded about that 2008 Sex and the City movie scene. “I do always have a little bit of trepidation when we start a new season of, ‘Oh, no, is Charlotte's wonderful life going to fall away?' And I do think that's how Charlotte receives the news. What I love about Charlotte is she's always going to do her best to be hopeful and to try to keep it together and try to be all things for all the people in her life that she loves. And she definitely does that, but you start to see some of the cracks after that episode.”

	











	She continues, “I really think it's great to show that because you can't just take care of everyone and not take care of yourself. It's a really important thing to remember, and Charlotte gets a really good — and funny but good — reminder that she also has to take care of herself. I always want everything to be great in Charlotte's life. As a character, obviously, you can't have everything worked out, but I don't want her to lose anything, ever. I feel very married to what Charlotte wants. I think you'll be happy with what happens. I hope you will.”


	In the most recent July 3 episode, another relationship was tested in a different way when Aidan (John Corbett) dropped a bomb on Carrie that he slept with his ex-wife, Kathy (Rosemarie DeWitt). The confession and ensuing conversation between the lovers has sparked think pieces and social media reactions around the series' central couple, who has been making it work long distance ever since Aidan chose fatherhood, and being there for his troubled son Wyatt (Logan Souza), over his relationship with Carrie in the season two finale.


	Creator-writer King and star-executive producer Parker previously spoke to THR about the challenges of keeping Carrie and Aidan central to the show despite their Virginia-to-New York long distance, and King had summed up this third season as being “a nice balance of fun and fragileness.”

	











	“Things are fragile. Life is fragile. At any moment, something can happen,” King had told THR. “And, it's part of life, but there are a lot of fragile emotions. I think what Carrie and Aiden are going through can be very complicated, and the fun of writing it was the maze of that and trying to figure out whose side the audience would be on at every given moment. Are they now understanding his point of view? Are they understanding her point of view?”


	After Aidan's sex-with-an-ex confession, it seems the audience has spoken. But fans may be too quick to forget that when Carrie revealed her affair with Big to Aidan in the original series, all she ever wanted was forgiveness from Aidan. (Instead she got: “You broke my heart!”) And this time, Carrie doesn't even consider it to be cheating, since she didn't view the terms of their current relationship as exclusive — even though Aidan apparently did.


	Executive producer and writer Julie Rottenberg, who directed the episode, acknowledged how divided fans have grown over Aidan's choices in season three. “I know many people who were so in love with Aidan and felt like he could do no wrong,” she told Glamour. “I know there's still a divide, but I can't believe many people have turned so hard on him and are very critical of him to the point saying he's making excuses for his kid and he's too protective of his kid.”


	Parker, meanwhile, stood by the storyline and Carrie easily forgiving Aidan. “When you're in your 50s, you listen differently and you allow people to disappoint themselves, disappoint you, and that doesn't mean it's the end of the line,” she told the outlet. “This is the way in which people might reach for one another when things are so fraught, when it feels so scary, when you have such concerns about your child. It's possible that this is the way you comfort one another.”

	











	Her answer harkens back to what King said when teasing the 12-episode third season. “Here we are, 27 years into the evolution of Carrie Bradshaw. And seeing her really evolve and grow and change and risk still right in front of us, is thrilling,” he told THR. “Very rarely do you get to see an actor play characters for this long. And as long as there is a story to tell, because life is unexpected and complicated and challenging, it's fun to be able to show that in a fictional world. Fragility and fiction is fun.”


	And Just Like That releases new season three episodes on Thursdays.

	The original Thomas Crown, made by United Artists in 1968, starred Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway and involved a man who organizes bank robberies for sport but meets his match when he falls for (or maybe not) the insurance investigator hot on his tail. The 1999 remake starred Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo.


	Sources say this time the action is taking place in Europe while still keeping the art thieving theme.


	Taylor Russell is already on board as a suave private detective. Character details for Gladstone and Branagh are being kept under the umbrella.


	Amazon MGM has set a March 5, 2027 theatrical release for the romantic thriller.


	Drew Pearce wrote the script for Thomas Crown after a previous draft was written by Wes Tooke and Justin Britt-Gibson, which was based on the original film.

	











	Patrick McCormick and Toberoff Productions' Marc Toberoff will also serve as producers. Alan Trustman, who wrote of the original 1968 film, is an executive producer.


	Branagh won the Oscar in 2022 for original screenplay for his film personal drama Belfast, which he also earned him nominations for directing and for best picture. He already had five previous Oscar nominations under his belt. As an actor, he appeared in Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer and will next be seen opposite Ryan Reynolds in Mayday.


	Gladstone became the first Native American to be nominated for an Academy Award for best actress thanks to her starring role opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon. The role also earned her the 2023 Golden Globe for best actress in a drama motion picture, the 2024 Screen Actors Guild Award for female actor in a leading role, best actress of 2023 by the New York Film Critics Circle and The National Board of Review.


	Gladstone appeared in Hulu's limited series Under The Bridge in another role that earned her various accolades, an Emmy, SAG, and Indie Spirit Award nominations among them. She can currently be seen in Andrew Ahn's The Wedding Banquet for Bleecker Street.


	Gladstone is repped by IAG, Authentic and McKuin Frankel while Branagh is repped by WME, Berwick & Kovacik, and Gochman Law Group.

After receiving a Karlovy Vary Film Festival honor, the actress talks about not being cool and ""kind of stuck"" in acting, preferring trees over AI and ""my sort of silent resistance"" in the digital age.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


Vicky Krieps is one of the stars featured at this year's 59th edition of the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (KVIFF). On the opening night of the festival in the Czech spa town, she received its President's Award to a huge ovation. She also introduced a screening of Anna Cazenave Cambet's Love Me Tender, starring Krieps. 


	And she took time to reflect on her acting career, including her upcoming film with Jim Jarmusch, social media, AI and much more in a wide-ranging discussion during a roundtable interview with reporters.

	During her acceptance speech, the actress had told the loving crowd that she was never cool. Asked about that comment, she explained to the press roundtable: “It's true. Of course, I'm challenging people's ideas because they think I am cool, because I'm an actor and I do what I want, I say my opinion, and that's cool. But the truth is, it's a journey. And when I started my journey, like all of us, and I went to school, I was not cool. In high school, I wasn't bullied, I wasn't expelled from school, but I never managed to fit in. Yet, I didn't try to be different.” 


	Krieps continued by sharing a story from her time in school. “I would have been happy to fit in, but I didn't. I wasn't chasing to be special,” she said. “I remember wearing a tie, because I was thinking: ‘Why is no one doing that?' To me, it was just a beautiful piece of clothing. I didn't give it much thought. So I went to school with my tie a few times, and of course, immediately they thought that I'm into girls, and that's a problem, and I just ignored it. I decided not to think about it. Also, I didn't finish my studies because I had a child too early. I never wanted to, but I ended up oftentimes doing things that put me on the outside. It's an illusion what's cool and what's not cool. That's basically what I was trying to say.”

	











	Krieps also shared her thoughts on what drives actors. “I think most actors have a traumatized childhood, and they try to heal themselves,” she said. “That's why they become actors, and then it's a matter of how truthful you deal with this. How much do you share honestly with people watching you suffer in becoming a person. Life is about becoming yourself. And in order to become yourself, you have to suffer. It's like taking off skin after skin. And a good actor is someone who does that in a way that allows you to see them take off their skin again and again. With every movie, you become more and more yourself.”


	That led to a debate about social media. “There's a big misconception, especially nowadays, when you have Instagram or social media and the Internet and these things,” Krieps said. “Not that it's only bad, but a lot of it is bullshit, because it tells some sort of tale of celebrity, which is not true. Celebrities are usually people who are stuck in another role they've been given, which is ‘now you are famous.'”


	Given the various celebrated roles she has taken on during her career so far, portraying both historical figures and fictional characters, what's Krieps' secret to nailing her roles? Her answer may surprise you. “I actually choose to not prepare. And it's a conscious choice, because what I'm trying to avoid is it becoming the exercise of Vicky Krieps, the actress, and saying, ‘Look at how well I did my homework. I really walk like someone from the 1800s. Or, I really speak like Ingeborg Bachmann.' Because to me, then I let down the audience, because then I take away this moment where I am truly taking off my skin, and I'm truly trying to find something. You're watching me truly trying to survive, truly trying to find an answer to something where there is no answer.”

	











	That said, she also suggested that actors may have “two brains” or use two parts of their brains. “One brain is always doing the homework,” she argued. “So the minute I know I am playing [Austrian Empress] Sissi, anything I see around me that is Sissi, I will absorb, and it will calculate.” When she played the Austrian author Ingeborg Bachmann in Margarethe von Trotta's Ingeborg Bachmann — Journey Into the Desert, Krieps didn't seek out interviews with her, though. “I didn't want to even listen to her speak. I think I heard her speak once before preparing for the movie,” she explained. “And the crazy thing, and that has happened to me a few times, the brother who's still alive came to me and was in shock because he didn't understand why I spoke like his sister. He was like, ‘How did you know?' It was not only about the voice, it was also about certain movements and things people wouldn't know, but he knew. So I think by removing my preparation, I make space for something to come in, which is inspiration, like in music.”


	Concluded Krieps: “We all know that with the great musicians, there is something that makes the way they play things different, and it has to do with something that they don't really control themselves. And I think with actors, it's the same. You can open yourself to some different kind of knowledge that is not yours.”


	In this context, Krieps also shared one thing she dreads in particular. “One fear I always have is [that of] the imposter, that someone will come and say, ‘Oh, look at her just trying to pretend,' because I am not her,” she said.

	











	Asked about trying to feel her way into roles and avoid information about characters and avoid distractions in the digital and information ages when the Internet, mobile phones and other technologies rule people's attention, Krieps offered that she is trying to take an alternative approach to it all. “I think what I'm doing is my sort of silent resistance. I really don't give in to any of this,” she explained. “I have to give in to it in a way that it is part of my life, because it's just being forced on me. We are all slaves of this thing. But what I can do is: I don't give a fuck. I don't care. I will always say what I think, and I don't care if they think I'm important or not. I don't think it's interesting if I have ‘likes' or if I don't have ‘likes.' I don't care if I didn't see a text. I don't care if I'm not behaving the way I'm supposed to.”


	Continued the star: “Fighting it wouldn't work. I mean, I did not have a phone for a year, and that was wonderful. I might do it again. But fighting it is very difficult, also, because fighting always only generates fighting. If you fight something, there will be something coming back. So I've decided to just not care. I just really don't care. I don't care if I am good for them or the Internet.”


	How does she feel about AI? “I cannot lose my energy on fighting something that is, for so many people, apparently so important. Yes, they can have artificial intelligence, but I will just look at the tree, and they can go and they can do what they do, and they can talk about what they talk about. But I myself will look at the tree and be more interested in the tree.”

	











	Krieps obviously is happy to avoid all the hype and noise. “I like silence,” she told reporters. “There's so much noise nowadays that I just believe in silence. And whenever I can hold silence in a movie, I'm holding it, and I'm also holding it for everyone else. I'm inviting everyone into the silence.”


	Could she imagine stopping work as an actress? “I would love to,” Krieps replied. “I'm kind of stuck in this, also financially…. Having to raise two kids and also being the sole provider, because the father of the kids doesn't really earn money. I can live off this, which is already very cool, and I'm proud of that. But I couldn't yet build a [financial] cushion. I would like to take a break and then maybe write a script or something. I have all this in me. I just need the time and the possibility.”


	Krieps has had a lot of great acting opportunities, of course. And her latest one is a role in Jarmusch's upcoming Father, Mother, Sister, Brother, which also stars Cate Blanchett, Adam Driver, Mayim Bialik, Tom Waits and Charlotte Rampling.


	“What I really, really love about [Jarmusch] is that he is still just making a movie. He's not trying to make the next Jim Jarmusch. He's not trying to go to Cannes,” Krieps said. “He's really trying to figure out how to make the movie on set, like a student would make a movie. And that is very, very beautiful. That's very loving, so it was a very loving set, very careful set. Working with Cate Blanchett and Charlotte Rampling was a gift, and we just had so much fun. We were laughing.”

Sabrina Carpenter turned London's BST Hyde Park into a full moon party Sunday night (July 6), bringing out surprise guests Duran Duran for a raucous rendition of their 1982 hit “Hungry Like the Wolf.”

	The 26-year-old pop sensation performed two consecutive sold-out shows at the iconic outdoor venue, kicking off July 5 with an all-star supporting cast including Clairo, Beabadoobee, Amber Mark, Luvcat, Ider, Sofy, Dellaxoz, The Tulips and Sola. For her second night on July 6, Carpenter returned with Clairo again, alongside Olivia Dean, Chloe Qisha, Miso Extra, Tanner Adell, and others.

	On Sunday night, she had the crowd rehearse their howls before introducing her surprise guests. “I also thought it might be fun if I brought out some friends of mine from the U.K.,” Carpenter teased. “I'm going to need you guys to put that howling to good use. But everybody please give it up and make so much noise for the legendary Duran Duran.”


	Frontman Simon Le Bon and bassist John Taylor joined Carpenter on stage to perform the band's 1982 classic “Hungry Like the Wolf.” Le Bon took the lead vocals as Carpenter chimed in with harmonies and later handled the second verse. 


	The special appearance capped off Carpenter's two-night Hyde Park stint, part of her ongoing Short n' Sweet World Tour, which has seen the singer graduate from theatres to arenas and festival main stages worldwide. This leg comes ahead of her upcoming album Man's Best Friend, the follow-up to 2024's Short n' Sweet.

	











Sharing the news on Instagram last month, Carpenter unveiled the project's sensual cover art — a photo of the Grammy winner down on her knees in black stilettos, held in place by a man gripping a fistful of her hair — and revealed that it will arrive Aug. 29. “i can't wait for it to be yours x,” she added in her caption.


	According to its Spotify countdown page, Man's Best Friend will feature 12 tracks, including lead single “Manchild,” which recently debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. The country-tinged track — co-written and produced alongside Carpenter's Short n' Sweet collaborators Jack Antonoff and Amy Allen — finds the Girl Meets World alum playfully calling out incompetent men.


	Carpenter is set to headline Lollapalooza in Chicago on Aug. 3 before embarking on the second North American leg of her tour, which will run through November.

	The highlight of the night was the live premiere of their brand-new track “Jump,” which sent tens of thousands of fans into a frenzy. The powerful sound and choreography underscored how BLACKPINK's musical world continues to evolve.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Each of the four members has spent the past years honing their skills through solo activities in the global market, and they brought that growth to the stage with individual performances that showcased their unique styles and artistry. 


	What made this concert even more meaningful was the members' direct involvement in every aspect of production—from stage design to choreography, sets, and props—creating an experience that felt deeply personal and authentic to fans. The show encapsulated BLACKPINK's musical journey so far, while also hinting at the exciting future ahead.


	Joining the group on stage were world-class band sessions and dancers who have worked with global pop icons like Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande, enhancing the performance with dynamic and fresh energy.

	











	 Supported by a top-tier creative team from Korea and beyond, the show struck a perfect balance between cutting-edge production and emotional resonance, transforming it from a concert into a true cultural experience.


	And this is only the beginning. With 31 shows planned across 16 cities around the world, the DEADLINE tour marks the start of BLACKPINK's next era. Expectations are already sky-high—and once again, BLACKPINK is poised to raise the bar for what K-pop can be on the global stage.


‘블랙핑크 인 유어 에리어!' 블랙핑크가 돌아왔다. 월드투어 ‘DEADLINE' 고양에서 성대한 개막


	지난 7월 5일과 6일, 블랙핑크는 고양종합운동장에서 단독 콘서트 ‘BLACKPINK WORLD TOUR DEADLINE IN GOYANG'을 열고, 2년 8개월 만의 전 세계 팬들과의 새로운 여정을 시작했다. K-팝 걸그룹 최초로 고양종합운동장 주경기장에 입성한 이번 공연은, 단순한 컴백이 아닌 새로운 K-POP 역사의 첫 장이었다.


	이번 투어는 블랙핑크가 왜 ‘K-팝 레전드'로 불리는지를 다시금 입증한 자리였다. 첫 곡 ‘Kill This Love'를 시작으로, 무대는 압도적인 에너지로 채워졌으며, 공연의 하이라이트는 단연 이번 콘서트에서 처음 공개된 신곡 “Jump”였다. 이 곡은 무대를 찾은 수만 명의 팬들을 열광시켰고, 블랙핑크의 음악 세계가 여전히 진화 중임을 강하게 각인시켰다.


	네 멤버는 각자 개인 활동을 통해 글로벌 시장에서 활약하며 역량을 끌어올렸고, 이번 콘서트에서 멤버별 솔로 무대를 선보이며 각자의 개성과 음악성을 녹여냈다. 특히 무대 연출, 세트, 안무, 소품에 이르기까지 멤버들이 직접 제작에 참여해 더욱 진정성 있는 무대를 완성했다는 점이 팬들에게 깊은 감동을 선사했다. 공연 전체는 블랙핑크의 음악 여정을 집약한 동시에, 그들이 앞으로 보여줄 미래를 암시하는 무대로 꾸려졌다.

	











	이번 공연에는 레이디 가가, 아리아나 그란데 등 글로벌 팝스타와 함께 작업한 최정상급 밴드 세션과 댄서들이 합류해 역동적이면서도 신선한 퍼포먼스를 완성시켰다. 국내외 최정상의 스태프가 참여한 무대는 기술과 감성이 조화를 이루며, 단순한 공연을 넘어 하나의 문화적 경험으로 자리매김했다.


	이제 시작일 뿐이다. 고양을 출발점으로 전 세계 16개 도시에서 31회차 공연이 예정된 DEADLINE 투어는, 블랙핑크가 펼쳐나갈 ‘새로운 시대의 이야기'를 예고하고 있다. 팬들의 기대는 이미 최고조에 달했으며, 블랙핑크는 그 기대를 넘어서는 무대로 또 한 번 K-팝의 기준을 다시 쓰고 있다.

Manchester's Radar Festival is seeing a growing wave of artist withdrawals in the wake of Bob Vylan's controversial Glastonbury performance and subsequent removal from the Manchester event's lineup.

	The latest act to announce their exit is Dublin metalcore band Hero In Error, who announced on Instagram that they would no longer perform at the independent event, set to run through July 6 at Manchester's O2 Victoria Warehouse. “We will not be performing at Radar Festival this weekend,” they began in a statement.

	“After speaking with Radar's organisers, it's clear they're facing the same pressures that many de-platformed artists are currently experiencing. They are good people, and it's evident they stand for progressive ideals.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	They continued, “Both they and the artists being targeted are caught in a wider effort to deflect attention from the reality of what's happening. We respect the work Radar has done, but we believe that stepping back from this year's event is the right decision at this time.”


	Their departure follows similar moves from The Scratch and ĠENN, who also withdrew over the weekend in protest of Bob Vylan's removal. Meanwhile, The Scratch shared their own message with fans, explaining their decision to withdraw as an act of solidarity.

	











	“The censorship and de-platforming of artists speaking out against the ongoing genocide in Gaza is greasy, dangerous and must be challenged,” they wrote. “To be clear, this decision is not a criticism of Radar Festival. We understand it was an incredibly difficult and complex situation. This is about showing solidarity with Bob Vylan and any artist who may face similar treatment in the future.”


	They continued, “Shadowy government influence and wealthy lobbying groups should not be allowed to dictate who is given a platform and what can be said on it. This situation will only worsen unless we, as artists, support one another and take action.”


	ĠENN echoed a similar sentiment, citing concerns about “bullying, censorship, and strong-arming” directed at Bob Vylan and Radar Festival.


	“As a minority on pretty much every line-up, and with a relatively modest platform, we considered whether we could use our physical presence to speak against the bullying, censorship, and strong-arming demonstrated towards the likes of both Bob Vylan and Radar,” the band said. “For our safety and sanity, we've made the final decision to pull out from performing at Radar this weekend.”


	“Our fight should not be focused on the policing of those who are trying to spread awareness within their means. This is a distraction from a wider picture. Pressure needs to be placed on those who are instigating the censorship of a genocide happening in real time.”


	Bob Vylan were pulled from Radar earlier this week after leading chants of “death to the IDF” during their Glastonbury set on June 28. The duo also criticised the BBC, the U.S. and U.K. governments, and more, sparking widespread backlash. Glastonbury organisers said the chants “crossed a line,” calling it “anti-Semitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.”

	











	In the days since, Bob Vylan have been dropped by their agency, lost multiple international festival slots, and had their U.S. visas revoked. The duo maintain that their remarks were not calling for harm to any group but rather “the dismantling of a violent military machine.”


	Radar Festival organiser Catherine Jackson-Smith has been vocal about the pressure placed on the event, saying it was “categorically one of the most horrendous professional discussions I've ever had” to remove Bob Vylan. “I cannot express clearly enough that I wanted Bob Vylan to perform at our festival,” she told the Two Promoters One Pod podcast but revealed the decision was made to avoid jeopardising the festival's entire Saturday program.


	Meanwhile, Massive Attack and other artists including Amyl and The Sniffers and Soft Play have publicly supported Bob Vylan, urging the media to focus on “what is happening daily to the people of Gaza” rather than silencing artists who speak out.


	Radar Festival has yet to confirm a replacement for Bob Vylan's headline slot.

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: After seeing Wicked soar to 10 Oscar nominations and a worldwide gross exceeding $756M, and with the back half of the two-part musical coming up for release in November, Jon M. Chu has inked a deal to direct a live-action Hot Wheels movie for Mattel and Warner Bros. Pictures.


Juel Taylor & Tony Rettenmaier, a writer-director duo whose credits include Creed II and They Cloned Tyrone, have been tapped to pen the script, with J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot and Chu's Electric Somewhere producing. Robbie Brenner will produce for Mattel Studios alongside Chu, Abrams and Michael Bostick, with Arturo Thur de Koós overseeing for Mattel Studios. Sheila Walcott and Zach Hamby are overseeing for Warner Bros. Pictures, along with Jon Cohen for Bad Robot and Jane Lee for Electric Somewhere.

			Watch on Deadline		







Hot Wheels is billed as an action film, inspired by Mattel's bestselling toy car line, which will showcase some of the world's hottest and sleekest vehicles. Further plot details are under wraps. The project reunites Chu with Warner Bros and Bad Robot, amid their current work together on Oh, the Places You'll Go!, an adaptation of the classic Dr. Seuss story, which marks Bad Robot's first theatrical animated feature.


	In a statement to Deadline on today's Hot Wheels news, Mattel Studios' President and Chief Content Officer Brenner said: “Jon's ability to craft rich, elaborate worlds with a distinct point of view makes him the ideal storyteller to bring Hot Wheels to life. His films are visual spectacles — true eye candy — but what sets them apart is how he weaves unforgettable narratives within those stunning frames. Paired with Juel and Tony's compelling storytelling, this team is uniquely positioned to capture the heart, adrenaline, and spirit of Hot Wheels, a leading brand in car culture.”

	Chu added: “Hot Wheels has always been about more than speed — it's about imagination, connection and the thrill of play. Bringing that spirit to the big screen is an incredible opportunity. I'm excited to partner with Mattel Studios, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Bad Robot to create an adventure that honors Hot Wheels' legacy while driving it somewhere entirely new.”


	A globally recognized brand of die-cast toy cars introduced in 1968, Hot Wheels was conceived by Mattel co-founder Elliot Handler as a cooler, more performance-oriented alternative to Matchbox cars, which dominated the die-cast market at the time. (Mattel went on to acquire that brand four decades after its introduction.) In addition to selling more than 8 billion vehicles worldwide, the brand has proved its influence in automotive and pop culture over the years via collaborations with global leaders in automotive, streetwear, fashion, luxury, entertainment, gaming, action sports and motorsports.

	Bad Robot announced its partnership with Mattel and Warner Bros on the Hot Wheels movie in 2022. In his own statement today, producer Abrams said: “We already felt incredibly lucky to collaborate with Mattel on this special film. Having Jon, Juel and Tony come aboard takes our excitement to a whole new level.”


	Added Jesse Ehrman, Warner Bros. Pictures' President of Development and Production: “Jon is a visionary director and an incredible partner to Warner Bros. We are thrilled to have him join us, along with the talented writing duo of Juel and Tony. With our collaborators at Bad Robot and Mattel Studios, we can't wait to bring Hot Wheels to life on the big screen.”


	Last November, the first half of Chu's two-part adaptation of the Tony Award-winning musical Wicked broke out as a cultural phenomenon, becoming the highest-grossing Broadway adaptation in domestic box office history. For his work on the film, Chu was named the year's Best Director by the Critics Choice Awards and the National Board of Review. Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande star in the musical, whose second installment, Wicked: For Good, is slated for release on November 21.


	Chu has teamed with co-director Jill Culton on Oh, the Places You'll Go!, featuring songs by La La Land‘s Benj Pasek & Justin Paul, which is dated for release on March 17, 2028. Recently, he also lined up Split Fiction starring Sydney Sweeney, an adaptation of the video game for Amazon MGM Studios. Also known for work on films like In the Heights and Crazy Rich Asians, the filmmaker is represented by Artists First, UTA, and Goodman Genow Schenkman.


	Recently combining its film and TV units under the banner of Mattel Studios, as we were first to report, Mattel has also recently announced feature adaptations of the toy brands Whac-A-Mole and View-Master. They're also developing projects based on IP including American Girl, Bob the Builder, Magic 8 Ball, Major Matt Mason, Polly Pocket, Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots, Thomas & Friends, UNO and Wishbone.


Hot Wheels scribes Taylor and Rettenmaier are repped by WME, Redefine, The Gotham Group & Darren Trattner at Jackoway Tyerman.

Good lord, how many decades as Hot Wheels been kicking around? Is it really that complicated?

JJ was supposed to write and direct this movie but smartly did Rad Racer instead. That should tell everyone a lot.

Kool Aid! The Movie!

What a waste of talent.

Mattel IP after Barbie is stale, outdated and not innovative. Same with its leadership who need to be replaced. Jon should make better use of his talent.

What do mean replaced? You couldn't mean, Robbie. No, her title is earned… Chief C. Totally earned.

10000000%. Chief C all day, every day. The title finally caught up with the reputation.

EXCLUSIVE: Oscar nominee Lily Gladstone (Killers of the Flower Moon) is another new addition to Amazon MGM Studios‘ reimagining of The Thomas Crown Affair, to be directed by and star Michael B. Jordan.


	No word yet on the role to be played by Gladstone. Oscar winner Kenneth Branagh is another new addition to the cast, as we told you earlier this morning, when Oscar-winning producer Charles Roven announced his involvement with the project, as well. Jordan and Taylor Russell lead the cast of the film, which shoots this summer and is slated for an exclusive theatrical release on March 5, 2027.

	











	While plot details are being kept under wraps, both the original 1968 film from United Artists and the 1999 remake from MGM were heist stories revolving around a wealthy, thrill-seeking man who orchestrates a high-stakes robbery simply for the challenge, only to find himself entangled in a complex cat-and-mouse game with a brilliant investigator.




			Watch on Deadline		







	As previously reported, Drew Pearce wrote the script for The Thomas Crown Affair, with Wes Tooke and Justin Britt-Gibson penning an earlier draft, based on the original film. Patrick McCormick and Toberoff Productions' Marc Toberoff will also serve as producers, with Alan Trustman — who penned the 1968 original — serving as executive producer.


	Since becoming the first Native American to be nominated for the Best Actress Oscar for her starring role in Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, Gladstone has been seen starring in Erica Tremblay's Apple pic Fancy Dance, Morrisa Maltz's indie drama Jazzy, and Hulu's Under the Bridge. Currently, she can be seen starring in Andrew Ahn's update on The Wedding Banquet for Bleecker Street. Other upcoming projects include Mark Pellington's action thriller Lone Wolf, opposite Bryan Cranston, and the starry indie comedy In Memoriam from writer-director Rob Burnett. She is represented by Authentic, IAG, and McKuin Frankel Whitehead LLP.

EXCLUSIVE: Amazon MGM Studios‘ Michael B. Jordan-directed reimagining of The Thomas Crown Affair has added a pair of Oscar winners to its team: Kenneth Branagh (Belfast), who joins in an undisclosed (we're told villainous) role, and producer Charles Roven (Oppenheimer), who will produce the film via his Atlas Entertainment banner, alongside Jordan and Elizabeth Raposo via Outlier Society, and others.


	As previously announced, Jordan and Taylor Russell lead the cast of the film, which shoots this summer and is slated for an exclusive theatrical release on March 5, 2027.


	While plot details are being kept under wraps, both the original 1968 film from United Artists and the 1999 remake from MGM were heist stories revolving around a wealthy, thrill-seeking man who orchestrates a high-stakes robbery simply for the challenge, only to find himself entangled in a complex cat-and-mouse game with a brilliant investigator.

	As previously reported, Drew Pearce wrote the script for The Thomas Crown Affair, with Wes Tooke and Justin Britt-Gibson penning an earlier draft, based on the original film. Patrick McCormick and Toberoff Productions' Marc Toberoff will also serve as producers, with Alan Trustman — who penned the 1968 original — serving as executive producer.


	As you'll recall, Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway starred in the first Thomas Crown Affair, directed by Norman Jewison, while Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo toplined the '90s remake, helmed by Die Hard‘s John McTiernan.


	Winning his first Oscar in 2022 for his screenplay for directorial effort Belfast, Branagh's recent credits in front of the camera include Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, Tenet, and Oppenheimer. Most recently wrapping production opposite Boyd Holbrook and Hiam Abbass on Reed van Dyk's debut feature Atonement, he'll next be seen starring opposite Ryan Reynolds in Apple's action comedy Mayday. He is represented by WME, Berwick & Kovacik, and Gochman Law Group.


	Alongside partner Alex Gartner, Roven leads Atlas Entertainment, the production company behind Christopher Nolan's Best Picture Oscar winner Oppenheimer. Currently, the company is in post on Mercy, a sci-fi thriller for Amazon MGM starring Chris Pratt, Rebecca Ferguson, Kali Reis and Annabelle Wallis, which is slated for release in theaters on January 23, 2026. Upcoming for Amazon MGM Studios, Atlas also has Road House 2, the sequel to the studio's record-breaking 2024 reboot, which Guy Ritchie will direct, with Jake Gyllenhaal reprising his role as Dalton. Production begins this fall. In addition, Atlas' independent division is in post on Vicious, a horror film for Paramount Pictures, starring Dakota Fanning.

					By Greg Evans 

NY & Broadway Editor


	Producers Scott Rudin and Barry Diller announced today that Samuel D. Hunter's Little Bear Ridge Road will premiere on Broadway for a limited 18-week run this fall in a production starring Laurie Metcalf and Micah Stock, under the direction of Joe Mantello.


	Metcalf and Stock will reprise their acclaimed performances from the production's world premiere last year at The Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago. Performances will begin on Tuesday, October 7, ahead of a Thursday, October 30 opening night at Broadway's Booth Theatre.


	Steppenwolf has opted not to participate in the Broadway production.

	The production marks Rudin's return to Broadway since his 2021 departure following allegations of bullying his staff. In a New York Times profile three months ago, Rudin announced his plans to resume his producing career, saying he has undergone “a decent amount of therapy.” He called his previous behavior “bone-headed” and “narcissistic.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	The play that will see Rudin's return will be the seventh collaboration between Mantello and Metcalf, who returns to Broadway for the seventh time in 10 years. Rounding out the company from the initial run at Steppenwolf Theatre are John Drea and Meighan Gerachis. 


	The playwright, a recipient of a MacArthur “Genius” Grant, will be making his Broadway debut. His 2012 play The Whale was adapted into the 2022 film starring Brendan Fraser in an Oscar-winning performance.


	The synopsis: “On the remote outskirts of a small Idaho town, a razor-tongued aunt and her long-estranged nephew find themselves suddenly back in each other's orbit—two lonely souls with a crumbling house to sell and a tangled history to unravel. Bitingly funny and quietly explosive, Little Bear Ridge Road is a sharply etched portrait of two people reaching across emotional galaxies—searching for meaning and fumbling toward connection, even as they fear it might swallow them whole. In this piercing and profound new play, the void is vast, the stars are indifferent, and love—messy, human, and hard-won—might be the only thing tethering us to Earth.”

	











	The design team for Little Bear Ridge Road includes Scott Pask (scenic design), Jessica Pabst (costume design), Heather Gilbert (lighting design), and Mikhail Fiksel (sound design). Little Bear Ridge Road was commissioned by, and its world premiere was presented, at The Steppenwolf Theatre Company under Artistic Directors Glenn Davis and Audrey Francis and Executive Director E. Brooke Flanagan.

Oh, is he allowed to be back again?

Won't give him a dime. Too bad as I love Metcalf on the stage. If he had really worked at therapy, he would spend his remaining days doing good deeds for the poor instead of making more money.

The type of person that goes to a broadway play is the same type of person that goes to vegas restaurants owned by food network chefs.

It won't last 18 weeks. I give it 6 tops.

truly disgusting

					By Damon Wise 

Film Editor, Awards


Peter Sarsgaard arrived in Karlovy Vary as one of the festival's few honorees without a new film in the lineup — instead, he presented his 2003 film Shattered Glass, a visionary real-life drama about an ethically unmoored journalist whose embellished stories in some ways foresaw the media landscape of today. That doesn't mean the actor has been idle; he came to the Czech Republic direct from the set of William Gibson's 1984 sci-fi classic Neuromancer. 


	“It's a big, ten-episode thing for Apple,” he reveals. “I play a guy called Ashpool, who, if you've read the book, is a guy who's created something that's sort of like AI. He's the wealthiest person in the world, but the world is suffering. He's in his own small world of not suffering, and you see how that's an impossibility: Elon Musk may think he's going to go to Mars to get away from it all, but everything's going to follow him to Mars. There's no getting away. And who the f*ck wants to be on Mars?”

	After that, Sarsgaard will be seen in his wife Maggie Gyllenhaal's new film The Bride!, a '30s-set crime story loosely based on Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.  “I'm going to say that it's going to be controversial,” says the actor. “I mean, it's very punk. It's very radical in some ways, and the main characters in it are very imperfect. It's also a love story, basically. It's about the monster in all of us.” Contrary to advance rumors, the film is not a musical, as such, although Sarsgaard conceded that there are some dance routines. Is he a good dancer? “I will certainly dance if given the opportunity,” he laughs. “I'm known as the first one on and the last one off the dance floor. I shake it until my moneymaker's wet.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







DEADLINE: The clip reel of your past work that the festival showed here was pretty impressive…


PETER SARSGAARD: Anguish! [Laughs.] So much anguish, my God.


DEADLINE: How did you feel about it, looking back at your work?


SARSGAARD: I feel like I'm getting better and better as an actor. That's what I feel like. I feel like at least it's not going the other way yet.


DEADLINE: Have you always been able to be objective about your acting?


SARSGAARD: I think when I was younger, I thought I was great, period. Yeah. When I first started acting, the first time I ever did it, this beautiful woman named Karen Schmulen asked me to come to an acting class with her, because I seemed depressed or something. And so, I audited an acting class, and I remember sitting there watching these other actors. I always felt really like a non-actor. And I felt like a non-actor for a long time, because a lot of the people who were actors that I grew up around were very theatrical people. And the class had a lot of those people. They asked me to read from this play, Bent, which is about homosexuals in the Holocaust, and it was an insanely dramatic scene where he has to prove his sexuality — prove that he's heterosexual — by having sex with a dead woman. And I mean, the stakes could not be higher!


	And I didn't know that I could do it. I thought, well, this is impossible. And then I started doing it, and it was like I slipped into [a trance] and I came out the other side and everyone was looking at me like they had just watched something, and I went, ‘Oh wow, I'm really good at this. And so, I felt like I was really good at it kind of immediately. And I look back now and I see someone who needed to be seen, had a lot of emotions to let go of and express, and I was sort of just venting emotions for a long time. It wasn't as finely nuanced as I'm ultimately capable of. And it took a number of years to get all of that out. Now, I have access to an emotional life, but that doesn't have to be everything.


DEADLINE: When did you reach that point of letting go?


SARSGAARD: I mean, it was gradual. I don't know that there was an exact moment, but I knew it was something that I needed to ultimately do. I was asked to play a lot of people in crisis situations early on, a lot of victims. My audition for Dead Man Walking was: “Your girlfriend is getting raped in front of you. Improvise.” I actually have the audition tape. The casting director, Doug Aibel, still had it, and I saw it recently. It's very convincing. I look like a person who's watching his girlfriend get raped, but that's only one aspect of acting, right? To put yourself in heightened imaginary circumstances and be able to do it. I'm really glad that I'm not having to do that anymore. I mean, to be fair, the circumstances in Neuromancer that I'm doing right now are insanely high, the given circumstances, and I'm approaching it differently. The thing to remember is that people disassociate really well. This is something I think actors forget. I mean, if your girlfriend's being raped in front of you, I don't know that you even weep. I think you might. I don't know. Look at people in wartime. They're not crying and pulling their hair out all the time. They're in a kind of survival mode. It's not anguish all the time. So, I think that that's something that it takes time and wisdom to realize.


DEADLINE: Were you disappointed that your last film, September 5, didn't get the attention it deserved?












SARSGAARD: I think it was controversial, considering what's going on in Israel. What was interesting about that film is I had people who were on both sides of that war come up to me and say, “I have problems with the film,” and I've had people who are on both sides of that situation come up to me and say that they thought the film was great. To me, that film was just about journalism. It was about the beginning of 24/7 news coverage, and it asks, “Is seeing something in real time, without having any perspective on it, the truth?” I mean, is it better to take 24 hours to fully understand something versus following it second by second? Where you point the camera, you've made a decision already. It's already subjective. This idea that a live camera is the truth I don't think is… It's certainly not the full truth.


	So… I don't know. To me, it exceeded its expectations. When I went to go make that movie, if somebody had told me that it would've been nominated for any awards, I would've been very surprised.


DEADLINE: Just because it was so small?


SARSGAARD: Yeah. It was made for nothing. It had no money behind it. Awards are about money. Look, if you're on a big movie, that's a lot of voters that are just on your movie set that are going to vote for your movie, right? Or if your director has been nominated for 15 Academy Awards, chances are he will be nominated, the film will be nominated, and all the actors will be nominated. The awards are no litmus test of anything other than a certain degree of quality and popularity.


	I think awards are important for shining a light on movies that otherwise wouldn't have been seen. And so that's why, I guess in some sense, I'm into a kind of affirmative action with awards. We should really go, “What needs it?” Not necessarily what deserves it, because who the f*ck knows what deserves it? We all have different opinions on that, but what could use a spotlight? What could use some attention? For me, a film like Nickel Boys, that deserves some attention. That's an interesting thing that happened not that long ago in the United States and I thought the film was very well-made and, yeah, give that film some attention.


DEADLINE: You're in Karlovy Vary with another film about journalism, Shattered Glass, about a guy who fabricates his stories…


SARSGAARD: …In the interest of entertainment?


DEADLINE: Yes. How do you think that story resonates in today's world?


SARSGAARD: Isn't journalism all about entertainment on some level? I mean, why do we cover a hurricane coming toward some place in 24/7 coverage? It's not just to warn people to get away. It's because it's entertaining. It's a natural phenomenon that looks incredible. “Oh, we're going to get in a plane and we're going to look at it from the top and it's impressive.” It's viewership. A lot of the places where I get my news are not supported by advertising. And I think that if viewership is your model and advertising and all of that, then it's going to have an effect on the news. So, what happens in Shattered Glass is, he's trying to make it entertaining. So, he fabricates things to make it more entertaining. I think that happens so much now that it's almost like the movie feels old-fashioned. Right? I know a couple of journalists who are independent journalists, and I actually get a lot of my news from them.


DEADLINE: In your speech the other night you touched on current affairs in the United States. Do you like to use your platform as an actor, as a public figure, or is it more about the need to express how you feel?












SARSGAARD: I have no idea if anyone will listen to what I say, but anytime I'm in front of a microphone and there are a bunch of people, I consider it an opportunity. And I certainly am not going to stand up there and weep about how my acting teacher helped me get to this moment. I think we are not in the age of individual achievement. Nobody wants to watch an actor get up there and be like, “This is my big moment!”


	I think, above a certain level of quality in acting, we're all basically doing the same thing. Some people have more opportunities; some people have fewer opportunities. Some people have a bigger range, some of them less. And so, with the speech I gave in Venice and the one I gave here, I wrote them both on the same day that I gave them. It's whatever is on my mind on that day. I told [my agent] I was going to give a 45-second speech, because I also don't believe in long speeches. And in 45 seconds I want to say what? This is an opportunity to say something. I'm not an overtly political person. I'm not going to take down one political leader and prop up another. I'm not going to weigh in on some issue that's incredibly divisive, even though I have my own opinions about it. But I try to do a more 30,000ft view of what I think is all of our problems. What I don't see a lot in the world is anyone asking, “what is our collective problem?” I think for 99% of us, 1% [of the population] is fucking things up.


DEADLINE: Do you think actors in particular are starting to self-censor, because they don't know whether their words will be used against them?


SARSGAARD: I think that that time is ending. I was looking at actors at Cannes, they were all speaking out quite forcefully about things they believed in. I mean, some of them pretty controversially. I don't feel scared about it, really. I mean, I'm not an actor that's in big blockbusters that have to sell to every single person. My audience doesn't have to be absolutely everyone. When you make a movie for $10 million or under, you can make it however you want it. You don't have to have everybody like it. If you make a movie for a $100 million then you have to not say anything controversial. The good news is that I'm not like Tom Cruise. I think for him there would probably be more at stake in terms of saying what he thought. In some ways he does say what he thinks, but not super-controversially.


DEADLINE: What is your relationship with technology and AI?


SARSGAARD: My relationship with that stuff? Well, I'm just old enough that… I mean, I have memories of black and white television and getting up and changing the channel. I watched [TV shows] Hogan's Heroes, Baa Baa Black Sheep. These were the things I grew up watching. And we didn't get cable for a long time, because my family doesn't watch television. We didn't get cable until I was, I think, 14. And then I didn't get a cell phone until I was 23 or something like that. But my dad was a computer programmer and salesman and stuff and knew a lot about computers. And so, we always had IBM computers in the house. My dad also had a ham radio. They felt similar. So, my relationship with technology is still like that. I use this phone for music and chess. That's about it.

	The BBC has unveiled the full cast for its six-part drama Dear England, adapted from James Graham's hit National Theatre play about Gareth Southgate and his campaign to turnaround the fortunes of the England men's football team.

	Adam Hugill (Sherwood), Josh Barrow (Hostage) and screen newcomer Lewis Shepherd reprise their respective stage roles as Harry Maguire, Jordan Pickford and Dele Alli.


	New arrivals include Will Antenbring (Mr Loverman) as Harry Kane; Edem-Ita Duke (Mr Loverman) as Marcus Rashford; Francis Lovehall (A Thousand Blows) as Raheem Sterling; Abdul Sessay (Piglets) as Bukayo Saka; Jacob Greenway (The Dream Lands) as Jude Bellingham; David Shields (Masters of the Air) as Jordan Henderson; Hamish Frew (Generation Z) as Eric Dier; Alfie Middlemiss (Waterloo Road) as Phil Foden; Riess Fennell (The Football Fantastics) as Jadon Sancho; Daniel Quincy Annoh (The Recruit) is Ollie Watkins; Bobby Schofield (Unforgivable) as Wayne Rooney and newcomers Dom Rayner and Alexander Parsons are Cole Palmer and Jesse Lingard respectively.

	











	Produced by Left Bank Pictures (This City is Ours, The Crown) filming has begun in the South of England, and the series will air on BBC iPlayer and BBC One in 2026.


	As previously announced, Joseph Fiennes (The Handmaid's Tale, Shakespeare in Love) will reprise his Olivier award nominated role as Gareth Southgate.


	Graham's hit play charts how Southgate takes over the England team when it is at a low ebb and sets out to reverse its unenviable record of being the worst team for penalties in the world. Southgate knows he needs to open his mind and face up to the years of hurt to take England back to reverse a situation in which the country that gave the world football has delivered a painful pattern of loss.


	The stage play premiered at the National Theatre to five-star reviews, winning an Olivier award for ‘Best New Play' and a sell-out run in 2023. It returned to the National Theatre earlier this year before embarking on a national tour.


	“Bringing the national game to the National Theatre over two years ago was one of the most rewarding moments of my writing life,” said writer and executive producer Graham.


	“Getting to tell this inspiring story of Gareth's quiet revolution, and its themes of redemption, resilience, kindness and compassion in sport. To kick off its journey on screen now, and on our national broadcaster, is a huge opportunity and I'm so grateful to world class cast and creative team we've assembled.”


	Andy Harries, CEO of Left Bank Pictures, added:  “This is a premier league creative team and alongside the brilliant original team of James Graham, Rupert Goold and Joseph Fiennes we are over the moon to be reunited with Paul Whittington – who directed with such flair on The Crown. Jodie is pitch perfect as psychologist Pippa Grange and we are joined by a team of exciting actors joining the England squad. We are ready for kick off!”


Dear England (4×60) was commissioned by Lindsay Salt, Director of BBC Drama. James Graham will write the series, with Rupert Goold (Judy, King Charles III, The Hollow Crown), who directed Dear England on stage directing episode one. Paul Whittington (This Town, The Crown, White House Farm)will direct episodes two to four. Tina Pawlik (Ted Lasso, Top Boy) is the producer. Executive producers are James Graham and Rupert Goold, Andy Harries and Rebecca Hodgson for Left Bank Pictures, and Jo McClellan and Sami El-Hadi for the BBC. Sony Pictures Television will distribute Dear England internationally.


	“We're so thrilled to announce such a fantastic cast for Dear England and it has been a joy to witness the comraderie within this top team as they start filming. With Joseph Fiennes and Jodie Whittaker leading the cast, Rupert Goold and Paul Whittington directing and Left Bank Pictures producing, BBC viewers are in for a real treat,” said Salt.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Lena Dunham knows Girls ' lack of diversity was ""disappointing"" to people","https://www.avclub.com/lena-dunham-girls-lack-of-diversity","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 14:43:00 GMT","

With a name like Girls, it's reasonable to expect a show to represent a wide swath of girls' experiences. Girls, of course, largely didn't do that, choosing instead to focus on four white girls living in New York City. Creator and star Lena Dunham previously defended this choice, saying in 2012 that she was “half-Jew, half-WASP” and wanted to avoid “tokenism in casting,” per The Hollywood Reporter. 

Now, she understands that there may have been a bit more middle ground. “I think one of the profound issues around Girls was that there was so little real estate for women in television that if you had a show called Girls, which is such a monolithic name, it sounds like it's describing all the girls in all the places,” Dunham recently told The Independent. “And so if it's not reflecting a multitude of experiences, I understand how that would be really disappointing to people.”

Dunham isn't the only former Girl to reflect on some of the show's shortcomings more than a decade after its premiere. Allison Williams, who starred as Marnie, recently opined that the show could have benefited from an intimacy coordinator, telling the Not Skinny But Not Fat podcast that Dunham and Jenni Konner (a writer and producer) blocked and directed most of the show's “many” sex scenes themselves. 

Luckily, it sounds like all this experience helped Dunham make some changes for the better in her new show, Too Much. “The thing I have really come to believe is that one of the most important things is not just diversity in front of the camera, but it's diversity behind the camera,” she said. “As a producer, one of my goals is to bring a lot of different voices into a position where they can tell their story.”

Dunham is mostly behind the camera this time around. Too Much instead focuses on Meg Stalter and Will Sharpe, along with a large ensemble cast including Kit Harrington, Andrew Scott, Emily Ratajkowski, Aylin Scott, and more. Too Much premieres July 10 on Netflix. Check out the trailer below:

NeNe Leakes is reality TV royalty thanks to her run on “The Real Housewives of Atlanta.” Recently, rumors began to surface that NeNe could have been on the cast of “The Traitors” season four. Now she's confirming this and stating why she turned it down. 

NeNe Leakes appeared on the “Humble Brag” podcast, hosted by Cynthia Bailey and Crystal Kung Minkoff. Notably, NeNe and Cynthia have a history with one another as they were both on “The Real Housewives of Atlanta.”

During the episode, Cynthia asked NeNe Leakes about the rumors that the producers of “The Traitors” had asked her to join the cast for the fourth season. NeNe said, “Yes, I was asked to do Traitors.” Regarding why she didn't ultimately sign on, she revealed, “So, I was asked to do Traitors. I was really excited about doing it.”

The former “Real Housewives of Atlanta” star continued, “I couldn't do Traitors because my son was in the hospital, and he's still in the hospital.” She went on to say that he has been in the hospital since May. 

NeNe is this week's guest on Cynthia Bailey and Crystal Kung-Minkoff's “Humble Brag” podcast and no topic was left untouched!  Here, NeNe shares that her son being in the hospital is why she won't be doing Traitors this season! We wish him all the best and hope for a recovery.

NeNe Leakes didn't say which son was in the hospital. It's important to note that her son, Brentt Leakes, has had significant health issues. According to Essence, Brentt revealed in 2024 that he had undergone a heart transplant. He was 25 years old at the time and also received a diagnosis of congestive heart failure. 

NeNe Leakes' son said at the time on social media, “To begin with, let me say, ‘Thank you, God.' This year was undoubtedly the craziest for me.  After several trips to the hospital and many doctors' appointments, I finally heard the unexpected news that I was diagnosed with “congestive Heart Failure” On June 19 (Ish).”

He continued on Instagram, “In July of this year, I went into a 14-hour heart transplant surgery and now have a brand new heart in me. Now that I'm back (still in recovery), I've essentially had to relearn how to walk and communicate, but I'm even more fluent.”

While on “Humble Brag,” Cynthia Bailey asked NeNe Leakes if she would consider returning to “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” as a friend of the show instead of a full-time cast member. She stated that while she appreciates the conveniences of being part-time, she's unsure if she would be a friend of considering she debuted on the show in its first season. 

It's also worth noting that NeNe Leakes has answered questions about returning to the show. She has expressed some interest in doing so.

Country superstar Luke Bryan is used to critiquing and mentoring rising stars on “American Idol,” but on July 6, 2025, fans of A&E's “Duck Dynasty: The Revival” may have been surprised to see him show up on the show to do the same with 23-year-old cast member Will Robertson, the son of family patriarch Willie Robertson. 

So how did Bryan wind up on the episode? Here's how it all unfolded…

A post shared by Duck Dynasty (@duckdynastyae)

The original “Duck Dynasty” aired for 11 seasons on A&E. With nearly 12 million viewers at the height of its success, it was the “most-watched non-fiction series in cable history,” per the network. Until 2017, the show followed the Robertson family and its Duck Commander business, founded by the late Phil Robertson, who died in May at age 79, months after he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. 

After eight years, Willie and Korie Robertson returned to TV on June 1 with “Duck Dynasty: The Revival,” now navigating their lives with adult kids and grandchildren, and still managing the Duck Commander business in Louisiana. A&E has already picked up the reality show for a second season, per a press release. 

On the July 6 episode, Willie brought Bryan into the mix to help his son Will with his songwriting aspirations. 

“My dad and Luke Bryan have been friends for a very long time,” Will told Parade before the episode premiered. “I'm sure my dad went to a few of his concerts. Then Luke joined my dad's Buck Commander team as one of the buckmen, so they hunt a lot together.” 

“But obviously, Luke is one of the biggest country stars right now,” he continued, “and I got to just ask him a few questions about writing music and where he gets inspiration, how he gets it, what he does to (prepare).” 

When Will asked Bryan during the episode for advice on how to get into the mindset for writing a song, Bryan told him, “I think you kind of just gotta find a place that's your place to kind of do your work. And so you want to develop somewhere that you kind of got a little connection to.”

Will has been living in Texas with his wife Abby while the rest of the Robertson crew remained in Louisiana, and missing home inspired him to pen a tune called “Home” with Bryan's assistance. 

“It really helped a lot,” Will told the outlet. “And it was also just good to sit down with a family friend that we haven't seen in a while, (with) how busy he is with all that he's doing. It was cool to just sit and talk and get some advice from him.” 

Bryan and Willie have been hunting deer with their Buck Commander team of friends for over two decades, often filming their adventures for their YouTube channel. The team, which they call “The Buckmen” includes Adam LaRoche, Jason Aldean, Ryan Langerhans, Tombo Martin, and Tyler Farr. 

In February, they posted a video of their first-ever duck hunting expedition on Bryan's Tennessee farm, complete with the country star hilariously driving Willie crazy with his duck calls. 

Bryan's appearance on “Duck Dynasty: The Revival” isn't his first time making music with the Robertson crew. He's had some memorable performances with Willie over the years, including their funny “Rattlesnake” tune and performing “Hairy Christmas” on the Country Music Association's ABC Christmas Special in 2011.

On “General Hospital,” Molly Lansing Davis' love life is currently non-existent, as she dedicates all her focus to work. She split from TJ not long after the death of their child, Irene. Now, she and Cody seem to be inching their way towards one another, but love is going to take some time, if it happens between them at all. Thankfully, Molly's portrayer, Kristen Vaganos, is much luckier in the romance department.

The actress recently took to Instagram to celebrate the special man who has stolen her heart.

Kristen Vaganos, who took over the role of Molly in 2023, gave fans a peek into her personal life and a rare look at the man that she loves. She devoted several slides to his birthday.

“Please join me in wishing a very happy birthday to this impressive man,” she stated, then went on to express that “he is the kindest, most generous soul.” Not only is actor Nick Cafero “so talented” and “hard working,” he “makes the best quinoa salad” and “is fluent in every love language. And he's learning Italian!” Vaganos continued, “I love you, Nicky, thank you for sharing your life with me.”

A post shared by Kristen Vaganos (@kvaganos)

The Instagram carousel features a series of 12 photos and a video. Kristen highlighted various moments that she holds dear and showcased Cafero doing a little dance. Her “General Hospital” parents came out to send the couple some love as Nancy Lee Grahn (Alexis) shared, “Makes mama happy to see my children so happy!”. At the same time, Rick Hearst (Ric) added, “Ah. A nice Italian boy. Tanti Auguri Nicola!” which means “Happy Birthday, Nick!”

Also in the comments, Kate Mansi, who plays Kristen's sister on GH, said that everyone close to the actress knew at this time last year that Nick would still be around and in the mix now. 

Nick is just as smitten with Kristen. Back in May, he shared, “There is nothing this girl can't do. Except maybe allow people to celebrate her on her birthday. But I'm gonna do it anyways because, the way I see it, that's something about you that makes you all the more worthy. You deserve it all, my girl. Happy birthday! You'll always have a spot in my sweater.”

Hopefully, Molly Lansing Davis ends up as lucky in love as Kristen has.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","How Will Bombshell Affect Carrie on ‘And Just Like That'?","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/ajlt-carrie-bradshaw-aidan-bombshell-cheated/","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 16:40:18 GMT","

Carrie Bradshaw's romance with Aidan Shaw on “And Just Like That” has been moving in slow gear ever since the two first reunited last year. Rather than jump into a full-blown life together, Aidan realized that his home would still be in Virginia, with his troubled son, for the next five years, and Carrie agreed to be there when he was ready for more.

Aidan's visit on the latest episode of AJLT featured a bombshell that no one saw coming. He admitted to sleeping with his ex-wife, Kathy, after dealing with a stressful situation with their son. None of the writers wanted Carrie to have a massive reaction to Aidan's confession, EP Julie Rottenberg told TVLine, “You sort of see her talk herself through it.” 

Aidan attempted to be playful when he first arrived at Carrie's and tried to get her attention by throwing a pebble at her window. The window wasn't the only fragile thing that was affected by the impact of his visit. After shattering her ancient window, Aidan later risked breaking her heart by admitting that he had slept with his ex. 

Even more shocking than his misstep was her reaction. Carrie told him, “I kind of understand,” adding that she never agreed not to sleep with other people while they were apart, a revelation that floored Aidan.

Executive Producer, Elisa Zuritsky, believes: “In life, I think we don't say everything we think and feel at every moment, especially when the stakes are so high, and we really wanted to explore that kind of gray area between two people who really want it to work. Like, you sort of don't want to ruin it by over-talking.” 

The revelation that made Aidan feel so guilty seemed to barely impact Carrie, but it did require a second look at what terms the duo was willing to agree to.

Zuritsky says that Aidan's indiscretion “wasn't the thing that broke them, or at least in this episode caused such conflict, but it was the reveal of: ‘Wait a minute, what did you agree to?' It's sort of like neither of them wanted to go back. Actually, it's like going back to the most painful moment for each of them, for different reasons… I think there were a number of places where I felt like at any time, one of them could just want to eject out of that really sticky situation.”

The agreement that Carrie and Aidan made was a massive topic in the “And Just Like That” writers' room as they started working on Season 3. Elisa Zuritsky told TVLine: “On the first day, we all talked about what we each individually thought Aidan was asking Carrie to agree to, and we all said different things. So what we realized was: This is the perfect sociological or psychological experiment, where two people have basically signed different contracts.”

Carrie and Aidan have been through so much over the last 20 years, and this is one more instance where they are not actually in sync. Will they be able to make a new deal that they can both agree on clearly?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘General Hospital' Spoilers: Who Has Baby Daisy?","https://entertainmentnow.com/soap-operas/general-hospital-spoilers-daisy-missing-sidwell/","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 11:52:33 GMT","

Port Charles is still celebrating the Fourth of July, and several explosive storylines are expected for the week of July 7, 2025. A new “General Hospital” promo video has dropped, and it features the kind of fireworks that keep soap fans coming back for more.

Let's take a look at all that we know so far about this upcoming week on “General Hospital.”

Sonny is in an interrogation room at PCPD, talking to Laura, when Police Commissioner Anna Devane storms in, holding files. “I have the autopsy report here,” Anna announces. “And?” Laura asks in return as the promo video clip goes back to Anna, who has a concerned look on her face. Did the medical examiner find that Natalia's death was the result of foul play? Or was it an accidental overdose? Sonny's freedom hangs in the balance with the results.

Meanwhile, Marco already believes that Sonny is involved, and he is looking for revenge this week. “Sonny cannot get away with this,” the lawyer declares. As the video flashes to Sonny, Jens Sidwell makes a vow to his son. “He won't.” Will Marco's quest to avenge Natalia's death make him an unknowing participant in Sidwell's plot to take down Sonny? Or will Marco somehow manage to keep his hands clean?

Brook Lynn accidentally gave Lulu a taste of her own medicine, and she certainly doesn't like it. BLQ dug into Rocco's birth records, uncovering a secret that would traumatize him. She debated about telling him and then chose not to because she didn't want to cause the same sort of pain that Lulu had. Unfortunately, Brook Lynn left the file where Rocco could find it, and he then confronted his mother. Now, Lulu is seen in the clip slapping Brook Lynn while shouting, “She came for our son!” Will Rocco learn his true birth story?

Sasha has been basking in the joy of her new baby, Daisy. She walks into her nursery at the Quartermaines to check on her daughter, and Daisy's crib is empty. “Daisy?!?” she shouts, as she frantically looks around for the newborn. She quickly finds Michael near the front door of the estate and frantically says, “Michael, someone took our daughter!” 

Someone has been watching over Daisy, changing her clothing and moving her around, making Sasha think she is a little crazy. Now it's clear that these things have happened and that person has Daisy. Does Sidwell have the tot? Or is it someone else, and why would they have taken her?

Check out the explosive promo video for the week of July 7, 2025, on “General Hospital” below!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","'Holidazed' on Hallmark Channel: What You Need to Know About the Charming Christmas Series","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/holidazed-series-cast-where-when-filmed/","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 02:04:53 GMT","

At last, Hallmark's star-studded series “Holidazed” will make its way to Hallmark Channel as part of the network's Christmas in July programming slate. The eight-episode series aired exclusively on Hallmark+ during the 2024 holiday season, but will now make its cable debut starting on July 6, 2025. 

“Holidazed” chronicles the lives of six families who live on the same cul-de-sac, performed by an ensemble cast comprised of 36 principal actors including Hallmark fan-favorites like Erin Cahill, Holland Roden, and Ian Harding, as well as celebrated actors who are new to the network, like Virginia Madsen and Dennis Haysbert. 

In “Holidazed,” the six families living on Oakslane — the Hills, the Woods, the Lins, the Manetti-Hanahans, the Lewins and the Camarenas — all have big holiday plans, but none of them go as expected, of course. 

The first episode, “The Beginning,” outlines in quick-step detail how everyone in the cul-de-sac is connected and foreshadows the issues each family is facing, from strained relationships to a fake engagement. Most episodes of “Holidazed” focus on the saga of a certain family, but some cast members cross storylines, including Cahill, who plays the town sheriff and single mom. 

Though the characters' stories intertwine throughout the eight episodes of “Holidazed,” Cahill told EntertainmentNow in November that the script didn't call for all 36 actors to appear in every episode. That meant many of the show's stars — which include Loretta Devine, Noemi Gonzalez, Virginia Madsen and John C. McGinley — got to go home at different points.

As EntertainmentNow previously reported, “Holidazed” was filmed in Vancouver in late 2022. As they wrapped filming in early December, Cahill tweeted that it was “one of my favorite projects ever.”

She still felt that way two years later, as she promoted the show in November 2024, telling EntertainmentNow, “I got so lucky. I got to meet and work with everybody, and I was the only actor that got to do that. It was such a gift.” 

A post shared by Holland Roden (@hollandroden)

Though three years have passed since the cast filmed “Holidazed,” it's clear they still have a sweet spot in their hearts for the project. Many of them promoted Hallmark Channel's premiere in early July, including young actor Sebastian Billingsley-Rodriguez, who played Cahill's son. 

“This was such a special one to film,” he wrote in a post on July 6. “Adored working with everyone (truly a star-studded cast), especially acting alongside the fabulous talents of Erin Cahill (the most amazing and kindest Hollywood mom) and Ian Harding (the most amazing and kindest Hollywood buddy). I loved playing Theo Jacobs in this special holiday mini-Series.”

Roden, who will star in Hallmark's second “Holiday Touchdown” movie during Hallmark's 2025 Countdown to Christmas, wrote of the series in the above post on July 5, “This eight-episode series follows six families from different backgrounds, cultures and generations, all living on the same cul-de-sac, as they gather for the holiday season. During a time when emotions are amplified, each family comes together to celebrate their unique, rich traditions and navigate family eccentricities that ultimately help them discover what they do have in common: LOVE in all its different forms. ❤️🎉❤️🎉❤️🎉❤️”

Hours before the series premiere on Hallmark Channel, Cahill shared on Instagram, “Watch the first two episodes and get some much needed Holiday Magic! You guys, this is TRULY one of my favorite projects I have ever done. The cast, crew, stories we got to tell… it was a dream come true and I can't WAIT to hear what you think!! It was the greatest gift to be opposite @ianmharding and @sebastian_billingsleyrodriguez @dennishaysbert with the rest of this BRILLIANT cast. 💕”

“Holidazed” premieres with two back-to-back episodes on July 6 at 8 p.m. Eastern time, and will air two more episodes each Sunday night throughout the month of July on Hallmark Channel.

Genre:

Electronic

Reviewed:

July 7, 2025

The new project ex_libris quietly marks the return of a club music innovator: Dave Huismans, the Dutch artist also known as 2562 and A Made Up Sound. These two untitled EPs, released simultaneously, are his first new music in nearly a decade (save a 2023 ambient remix), after he quietly shuttered A Made Up Sound's eponymous label in 2016. Huismans' reasons for ending the project seem almost guilelessly simple: He had always seen it as a finite series and felt it had run its course.

A Made Up Sound's eight-year run was a highlight of what we now look back on as the post-dubstep era—a time when dubstep artists outgrew the genre's classic conventions and, when they didn't lazily revert to house and disco (looking at you, Skream), dreamed up weird and wonderful new mutations of the sound. Huismans, a Dutch outsider to this UK-centric scene, made much of its best music, reliably supplying cutting-edge DJs with records that were twisted, otherworldly, and utterly party-rocking. “I've no idea how Dave does it,” Ben UFO said when A Made Up Sound wrapped up in 2016. “It's experimental music that people have to move to.”

A Made Up Sound's final 12"" was 2016's Bygones / Peace Offering, a record that at the time Huismans said sounded “like what I wanted to make [in the beginning] but wasn't yet entirely able to.” Listening to that EP now, it's tempting to say that, with ex_libris, Huismans has picked up right where he left off. But in fact these new records show a far more skilled artist at work, venturing further than ever into the murky outskirts of club music. “Bygones” and “Peace Offering” are moody and atmospheric techno, luring the listener through a space as vivid as it is ethereal. The ex_libris project does something similar, but its soundworlds are vastly more elaborate and richly imagined. Stylistically, they are too unconventional to be called techno or anything else (though even more imperfect, the first word that sprang to mind for me was “illbient,” the short-lived genre tag applied to ambient hip-hop artists like DJ Spooky). That Ben UFO quote holds truer than ever: This is experimental music with an unusually physical charge.

Huismans has always been good at making electronic music feel loose—an almost quixotic task when you're making music on software. That remains a defining feature of his music now, but in a new way. Most of Huismans' old music had the sound of a machine on the brink of collapse, but in a funky way (see “Take The Plunge,” probably his biggest club hit). Where those tracks were clangy and glitched out, these are organic, earthy, and fluid, each one conjuring up a teeming ecosystem of flora and fauna, shot through with a damp thud of a kick drum.

His sense of rhythm has evolved as well. Many of these tracks have some form of rhythmic fake-out, opening with loops that set your inner metronome to one tempo, then, in a subtle sleight of hand, teasing out something altogether different. Take the first track of the first EP, “#13-20 (Wetlands)” (why the track titles are formatted that way, with nonsequential numbers followed by a title in parenthesis, is anyone's guess). The opening sounds, a drifting arrangement that calls to mind boats rising and falling in a harbor, form a groove that's loose and slow, half-time to the deep-house cadence that glides in after a minute. Same goes for what might be the suite's best track, “#32 (Walrus).” On this one, a fluttering groove blossoms at an odd angle to the syncopated, dubsteppy loops of the opening bars.

The arrangements are more poetic than ever, ditching the buildups and breakdowns of club music for something fluid and meandering. On “#8 (Cascade),” a bassline that, in another arrangement, might have been the track's central hook first appears well past the three-minute mark, more than halfway through the song. Perhaps the most essential feature of these records is also the most general: their mood. Huisman's past music had a clangy, glitchy, almost steampunk vibe, all metal and electricity. The vibe here is mellow and dreamy, serene even in its darker moments.

“I probably never even expected my music to be played in a club,” Huismans said in 2016. And then, as if to explain the hiatus that was about to ensue: “It's only after you've been doing it for a while that you realise the music itself was the main reward all along, rather than actually releasing it.” We can only speculate what Huismans was up to over the past nine years. Listening to these records, though, you have to think he was simply honing his craft, inching toward a sound that existed in his mind, taking as long as it needed to take.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Mark Lipsitz, Bar/None Records Label Manager, Dies at 62","https://pitchfork.com/news/mark-lipsitz-bar-none-records-label-manager-dies-at-62/","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 01:22:58 GMT","

Mark Lipsitz, the longtime label manager of Bar/None Records, died yesterday (July 5), according to the label. “Mark was a fierce artist advocate and championed the music he discovered, pushing everyone he knew to be the best musician and the best person they could be,” Bar/None Records wrote in a statement on Instagram. “The music industry is losing a coach, an ambassador, and an ally. But Mark created friendships and networks of people that would never thrive as they do without his influence. The work he leaves behind will enrich us all forever.” Lipsitz was 62.

In 1986, Bar/None Records was founded in Hoboken, New Jersey, at the hands of Tom Prendergast, a former pirate radio DJ and concert booker. After Glenn Morrow of Rage to Live became a partner in the label, Prendergast eventually left and Morrow tapped Lipsitz to spearhead Bar/None's marketing in 2001. As the years passed, Lipsitz took on all manner of roles at the label, from suggesting bands worth signing to helping artists navigate the daunting music landscape, as the roster grew to include Big Star's Alex Chilton, the Feelies, Ezra Furman, Tindersticks, the Front Bottoms, Diners, Pardoner, and dozens more.

Rocky O'Reilly, formerly of the Northern Irish duo Oppenheimer, told The Hudson Reporter in 2015 that Lipsitz didn't just help him find a broader audience internationally once signed to Bar/None, but to foster the drive needed to make the most out of life. “One phrase I heard from Mark early on, and many times after, was ‘proactivity breeds proactivity,'” he recalled. “I wouldn't be doing any of this if Bar/None hadn't picked our demo from a box and called me up full of passion, joy, and belief.”

Prior to joining Bar/None, Lipsitz also worked at Razor & Tie with acts like Continental Drifters and Dar Williams, as well as Seed Records via Atlantic and Important Relativity. Lipsitz often took a hands-on approach to working with and promoting bands at each label, with artists routinely speaking fondly of him in interviews over the years regarding his passionate approach to helping them grow.

One of the most beloved acts that Lipsitz discovered and helped champion to gain more recognition was Ivy, the cult 1990s indie-pop trio featuring the late Adam Schlesinger, Andy Chase, and Dominique Durand. Lipsitz took the band under his wing in 1994, helped Schlesinger get Fountains of Wayne signed to Atlantic, and welcomed Ivy back to Bar/None following Schlesinger's death and the discovery of previously unreleased Ivy music.

“When we told Mark in 2022 that we might have enough old material we could finish for a new IVY album, he was ecstatic about it and encouraged us to forge ahead and finish them. He was the loving, supportive mentor as always,” Ivy wrote in a lengthy tribute. “Secretly, Dominique and I were just glad to be having a pretext to be in his energetic, enthusiastic sphere again. Lunches, meetings, phone calls, always Mark's delicious southern drawl infusing us with his spirit and kindness. We were so happy to be doing all of this for and with Mark again.”

Ivy continued, “[I]n an ever changing and more turbulent musical climate now than ever, just know that if everyone in the music industry could have been like Mark Lipsitz, the landscape would be a more beautiful and stable place today. This much we know.”

Dozens of artists have shared tributes on social media honoring the late Lipsitz, including Emperor X and the Paranoid Style. “Mark was a great partner and longtime supporter at Bar/None Records,” wrote the Feelies. “He was tireless in his efforts in helping to promote the band, but at the same time he understood and ultimately appreciated what was important to us as individuals as we lived inside the world of music. He will be greatly missed.”

Maxo's music has a strange, hypnagogic ambiance, full of bottom-heavy beats, gaseous samples, and pitch-shifting vocals. There's a sense that nothing is ever quite settled. Songs seem to fade in and out of the ether, and Maxo's elastic timbre can be unrecognizable from track to track. He's charmingly bewildered by the complexities of life: Control-f a question mark in the lyrics of any of his albums and you'll get plenty of results. His last two projects, 2023's Even God Has a Sense of Humor and Debbie's Son, were interior works that balanced the vulnerable and melancholic with the confident and ecstatic. Despite their hazy sonics, both felt fairly straightforward, capturing the dueling feelings of immortality and abject terror that tend to mark one's 20s. Mars Is Electric pulls the threads those albums left dangling; it's his loosest, dreamiest dispatch yet, an enveloping and atmospheric collection that constantly comes together and breaks apart.

Maxo has described making MARS IS ELECTRIC as the first time he approached music without an end goal in mind. He wanted to remain open, following his ideas down whatever tunnel they led. That creative excitement comes through immediately on opener “All of Everything,” where his wordless coos line up like stepping stones over a squiggling mass of synths and clicks. It's pleasantly indica-scented, drifting aimlessly until Maxo's whispered verse, hard-panned to the left channel, appears like sweet nothings from a sleepy lover.

It's a sharp turn away from the clarity he'd been shifting toward, one that signals a deeper self-assurance than on previous records. The album's first third, full of floating pads and echoing drums, feels like a fog that lifts but never breaks, giving the rest of the songs the bright, hazy glow of an overcast summer day. Rather than his usual crumbling soul and jazz loops, Maxo sources production with a more electronic bent: “Saturday Love” and “Idk” are both inspired by '90s jungle; frequent collaborator Lastnamedavid channels Andy Stott's concrete thump on “Matt's Studio;” and Baird's programming on “Donahoo's Chicken” sounds like a '90s Memphis rap take on Tim Carleton and Darrick Deel's “Opus 1.”

MARS IS ELECTRIC is a much more textural exploration of Maxo's style overall. Cuts like “FWM” and “Eyes On Me” from Debbie's Son hinted at a more airy, expansive vocal style, and he leans further into those ideas here. Syllables stretch languidly over the ends of bars, and phrases hang in mid-air. Even during his tightest flows, like the triplets on the title track or the syncopated bounce on “Matt's Studio,” his words feel padded with space like glassware packed for a move.

That spaciousness makes Maxo's evergreen existentialism feel a little lighter, a little less urgent. When faced with cosmic overwhelm, like at the end of “Sweet N Sour” when he yelps, “I can't come back! I can't be reborn!”, he sounds more at peace than upset. A few months before the album's release, Maxo turned 30, an age often touted as a turning point towards more understanding and acceptance of oneself. There's a clarity of vision to MARS IS ELECTRIC that feels familiar but new, the sound of someone more willing and able to figure out who they are.

After a lifetime of perpetual motion, standing still can be harder than it seems. Juan Wauters' earliest solo albums had a transient feel, as if he was constantly walking around his home borough of Queens, an eavesdropping troubadour catching snippets of conversations and singing them back over the nylon-stringed guitar slung around his torso. Since then he's traveled to South America, collaborated with dozens of other musicians, and recorded about as much in English as Spanish. And after documenting his claustrophobia during early pandemic lockdowns on 2021's Real Life Situations, he began traveling again—including a move back to his birthplace, the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo.

The return home seemed to shake the rambler out of him. “During COVID I discovered/That I like stability,” he sang with a disarmingly straightforward candor on 2023's Wandering Rebel, “but the world still sees me/As a wandering rebel.” That one was recorded between New York, L.A., Brazil, and Argentina, so clearly he hadn't quite settled down yet. But MVD LUV, his seventh album, was recorded fully in Montevideo, which, in typical Wauters fashion, he announces in a fourth-wall-breaking, spoken-word intro: “Though I'm from here, this is the first time I get to record an album here,” he says. “I have always longed to do this.”

MVD LUV is, on its face, a full, loving embrace of where he was born and raised and now calls home again. Staying put means that Wauters can dig deeper and find more beauty in the details, folding in sounds of Uruguayan folk traditions and nodding to the lineage of experimental Uruguayan folk artists of the '70s and '80s. He's impressively deft with these new ideas, drums and cymbals drifting into the mix like passing carnivals heard from a top-floor apartment.

Burbles of drum syncopations drive “Manejando por Pando” and “La Lucía,” and “Aeropuerto” bursts into life behind insistent rhythms borrowed from the musical theatre tradition of murga. As ever, Wauters hops back and forth between Spanish and English, and his simple classical guitar lines anchor most of his melodies while flutes, synths, and a box piano flutter about. It's disorienting the same way that visiting any new city is a bit weird at first, but Wauters exercises impressive restraint to make sure this version of Montevideo feels real and tangible.

But beneath the cheerful tour guide act, it's clear that Wauters still isn't done reckoning with himself. And given the sweetly ramshackle nature of any Wauters album, his frankness here often comes as a shock. Early on, after two buoyant songs celebrating love, singing, and cars, he comes clean: “Can't help but fronting I'm doing well,” he sings on the piano ballad “Acting Like I Don't Know.” He dips in and out of these little despairs once every few songs. On “Dime Amiga,” he sings over his guitar and a little patter of drums, his cheerful melody masking the lyrics' sorrow: “Cosas en tu mente/De repente/Ahogándote” (“Things on your mind/Suddenly/Drowning you”). Wauters may like stability, but coming to a sudden stop after perpetual movement—literal or mental—is always going to take some adjustment. On the shuffling and breezy-sounding “Mutuación,” he sings, “Se hace difícil siempre estar/Acostumbrandose/A mi nueva forma de ser” (“It is always difficult to be/Getting used to it/To my new way of being”). The album's final track, an acoustic folk song, ends by bursting into life for a few dramatic seconds, just after Wauters has summed up the album's peripatetic theme: “After flying so much,” he sings in Spanish, “My tired wings will say/That there are times to fly and get lost/And there are also times to return.”

There's an earnest desire from Wauters to be understood here, or at least to make a meaningful connection with others: “Every time I wrote a song/I was thinking/I was wondering if what I was singing/They were things that everyone could understand,” he sings in Spanish on “Mutuación.”  Often, his jumping back and forth between languages can seem like an attempt to reach as many people as possible. In that sense, MVD LUV is less a love letter to his hometown and more an attempt to reconcile the irreconcilable: the wanderer and the homebody, Montevideo and Queens, a carefree melody and a stark admission of utter desperation (the minute-long a capella track “Lonely By Myself” is a particular jolt to the system). It would have been far easier to ignore these complications, play the lovable oddball, and put together an entertaining tour of his home city for outsiders. Instead, Wauters seems to have gone searching for his hometown and found his own reflection.

Love Island Season Seven bombshell Cierra Ortega has been removed from the villa. During Sunday night's episode, narrator Iain Stirling announced that the 25-year-old “left the villa due to a personal situation.” In the episodes leading up to her departure, viewers noticed that Ortega was receiving significantly less screen time. The production edit appeared to coincide with the surfacing of old social media posts from 2015 and 2020 in which she used a racial slur toward the Asian community to describe her eyes.


	Ortega is no longer in the villa, but has not yet returned home from Fiji, where the show is filmed. On her official Instagram account, her parents have posted a statement pleading for “compassion, for patience, for basic human decency” from the show's viewer base, which has grown more intense since expanding due to the success of Season Six.


	“As Cierra's parents, this has been one of the most painful weeks of our lives,” they wrote. “We've seen the posts, the headlines, the hurt and the hate. And while Cierra hasn't seen any of it yet, we have. And so have the people who love her. We're not here to justify or ignore what's surfaced. We understand why people are upset, and we know accountability matters. But what's happening online right now has gone far beyond that. The threats. The cruel messages. The attacks on her family, her friends, even her supporters, it's heartbreaking. It's uncalled for. And no one deserves that kind of hate, no matter what mistake they've made.”

	During her stint on the show, Ortega's social media accounts were being handled by her friend MJ Hedderman. After the posts surfaced, Hedderman stepped away from her role. “I cannot speak for anybody or make any statements besides my own, and decided to take a step back from running her account,” she said on her own account. “I was asked by her family to turn off comments and refrain from speaking on her behalf. This situation has been really difficult, and I'm still processing everything.”

	Viewers advocated for Ortega's removal with the same fervor, if not more, as they did for the removal of Season Seven contestant Yulissa Escobar. Escobar made it through one episode of the show before being quietly dumped from the island after clips surfaced from a podcast appearance during which she used the n-word multiple times. Producers would have opened the show up to even more criticism for not responding to both instances in an appropriate manner.


	However, some viewers have questioned whether the more hardcore and invested sector of the fanbase saw Ortega's racial insensitivity as an easy way to remove an obstacle between two other islanders they wanted to bring together, instead. Ortega was in a couple with Nic Vansteenberg since her first week in the villa. When she was removed, he was left “officially single.” This was bad news for those who were rooting for their couple, but considered a win for viewers who have wanted Vansteenberg to further explore his connection with fellow islander Olandria Carthen.


	Vansteenberg and Carthen briefly explored their connection after they were both dumped during the Casa Amor section of the show, only to be offered a lifeline to remain in the villa by coupling up. They ultimately agreed they didn't feel a spark after sharing a passionate (and now viral) kiss, despite what viewers and even host Ariana Madix seemed to believe. When the official post-Casa recoupling occurred, Vansteenberg and Ortega picked up where they left off and later “closed off” their relationship, meaning neither would explore other potential connections. With Ortega gone, Vansteenberg and Carthen are now in a couple together once again.


	In the villa, islanders do not have access to their phones or any other means of connecting with the outside world. The reason for Ortega's removal has not been revealed to them, and they're likely unaware of just how intense their viewer base has come to be. In June, Love Island issued a warning about cyberbullying. “Please just remember they're real people — so let's be kind and spread the love,” a social media statement from the show read.

	Madix issued a warning of her own during an “Aftersun” episode, the weekly recap of the show with former contestants filmed while the ones inside the villa get a break from the cameras. “I do want to say something to some of those people that are online,” she said. “Don't be contacting people's families. Don't be doxxing people. Don't be going on Islander's pages and saying rude things. You still have time to delete all of that, because the Islanders don't have their phones, so we're giving you a chance.”

	











	Ortega hasn't yet “had the chance to process any of this or speak for herself,” her family said, “but we know our daughter. We know her heart. And when she returns, we believe she'll face this with honesty, growth, and grace.” Her parents continued, “While she'll always be our little girl, she's also a woman, one who will take responsibility in her own time and her own voice. Until then, we're simply asking for compassion. For patience. For basic human decency. Not just for her, but for everyone caught in the middle of this. Thank you to those who've continued to show love, even when it's not easy.”

Zayn Malik appears to confront the racism he faced while a member of One Direction in a teaser for a new song, ostensibly titled “Fuchsia Sea.”


	Malik shared a snippet of the song on Instagram over the weekend, promising the full track would be “coming soon.” Following the mix of soft rock, soul, and country on his 2024 album, Room Under the Stairs, the “Fuchsia Sea” clip finds Zayn pivoting to pensive hip-hop, as he rhymes casually over a punchy piano beat. (It's worth noting that Room Under the Stairs also featured a song called “Fuchsia Sea.”)


	While Zayn covers a lot of ground in the clip that he shared, the line that jumps out most comes near the end of the first verse, and seems to be a very specific nod to his time in One Direction. “I'm a convert to the concert/And I did that for inflation/'Cause I worked hard in a white band/And they still laughed at the Asian,” he says.

A post shared by Zayn Malik (@zayn)


	The son of a Pakistani Muslim father and an English mother of Irish descent, Zayn has spoken before about facing racism and bigotry, especially when he was growing up in Bradford, England. While in One Direction, he occasionally spoke about being the target of online harassment, like in a 2012 interview when he said, “Nasty things [were said] like I'm a terrorist, and this and that. How can you justify that? How can you call me that and get away with it?”

	Zayn has yet to share any additional details about “Fuchsia Sea,” like when the full song will be release, or whether it's a one-off track or the first offering from his next project. 

	











	Earlier this year, Zayn completed his Stairway to the Sky Tour in support of Room Under the Stairs. At his final two shows in Mexico City, Zayn performed One Direction's “Night Changes” for the first time in 10 years. The performances happened to coincide with the anniversary of his departure of the group, and also poignantly came several months after the death of his former bandmate, Liam Payne.

	As the death toll rises in the aftermath of devastating flash floods that have ravaged areas of central Texas, celebrities are taking to social media to share relief resources and express sympathies for the impacted communities.


	“Dear San Antonio, our hearts and prayers are with those affected by the flood in Central Texas,” Shakira said on social platform X. The musician performed at the Alamodome on July 5. “We are donating a portion of tonight's show proceeds to Catholic Charities of San Antonio, who are providing disaster relief to the families impacted,” she continued. “If you would like to join me in donating, please click on the link below. Your help is important and appreciated.”


Maren Morris, an Arlington, Texas native, spotlighted the impact fund Texas Hill Country Community Foundation on Instagram. “Thinking of my home state right now. the floods are devastating and people are still missing,” she wrote. The foundation has set up funding resources for local efforts including nonprofits, local government, first responders, and shelters.

	Uvalde, Texas native Matthew McConaughey reflected on the tragedy in a social media statement shared on X and Instagram. “At least 70 lives have been lost, many more are unaccounted for, and countless Texans are hurting – inside and out,” he wrote. “If you're able, please lend a helping hand where and how you can. It's gonna be a long road ahead, but right now the shock, the pain, and the chaos need the steady hand of a neighbor. Texans are some of the most resilient and generous people on the planet.”

	











	On Instagram, Khloe Kardashian expressed sympathies for “the families in Texas and the overwhelming pain they're going through right now.” Of the dozens dead, at least 30 are children. Others remain unaccounted for, Gov. Greg Abbott said in a press conference.


	“As a mother, this kind of tragedy hits in a place words can't reach,” Kardashian continued. “The loss of those sweet, innocent children is something I can't fully process. there are just no words for this. My heart is so deeply aching for every parent, every family member, and every community. Please know that so many of us are carrying you in our hearts right now and I'm praying with everything I have in me for those still missing. Texas, we are holding you close.”

	Last week, Jon Bauman paused in the middle of a Zoom call with Rolling Stone, put on his glasses and glanced up at a TV screen in his home. “You and I are right now in the middle of the vote on the Big Ugly Bill,” he said as the Senate cast its ballots for or against Donald Trump's so-called “Big Beautiful Bill.” “This is the greatest loss of healthcare in the history of the country. No one's ever tried to do anything like this before. It's a horrible idea, and it's all in service of giving the wealthiest Americans a tax cut they don't need. That's not a good enough reason. Sorry.”


	If Bauman's name doesn't immediately ring any bells, his alter ego should. From 1970 until a farewell tour earlier this year, he was known to several generations as “Bowzer,” the cocky greaser with the flexed bicep, comically agape mouth, and heart-of-hoodlum-gold pose that made him the most iconic member of Sha Na Na, the long-running Fifties tribute band. Boomers remember Sha Na Na as the first retro oldies band, one that even appeared at Woodstock; Gen X knows Bowzer for his starring role on Sha Na Na's syndicated TV show, which lasted into the early Eighties.

	











	But these days, Bauman has his fist raised for a different reason. When he wasn't on tour hosting an oldies revue, he's spent the last two decades advocating for health-care issues. That phase of his life kicked in even harder in 2017, when he joined the Social Security Works Political Action Committee (PAC), an advocacy group that endorses and donates to candidates supportive of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, some of which are now imperiled by last week's vote. “I really am part of the resistance,” Bauman, 77 and a Medicare and Social Security recipient himself, says. “Besides being Bowser, I'm pretty much a public policy wonk. And for better or worse, I do understand how this stuff works, and I do understand who you elect to public office makes all the difference in the world and how these things play themselves out.”

	And he's not shy about it.  As he wrote in one of his many vitriolic recent X posts, “Some Trumpers want to know what we learned from the last election. We learned you don't give a f*ck about anything but beating us. You don't give a f*ck about your Social Security. You don't give a f*ck about your Medicare. You don't give a f*ck about your drug prices.” (When another questioned his expertise and relevance, he replied, “Eat shit. Blocked.”)


	Bauman's past is never that far back in the rearview mirror. In 1972, John Lennon and Yoko Ono headlined a benefit concert at New York's Madison Square Garden to help a a home for disabled children and adults. In this year's One to One: John & Yoko doc, about the show and their lives in New York during that period, we see the concert's climactic moment: a sing-along of “Give Peace a Chance,” with … Sha Na Na? “I don't know who asked us to do it, but we always had a great show,” Bauman says. “So I'm not surprised that people wanted us to do stuff. But I was a little surprised when we were singing ‘Give Peace a Chance' and John turns as he's playing and looks at me and goes, ‘Hey, come over here,' and invited me to the mic.”


	That clip was a reminder of how big Sha Na Na were, for a time, part of a retro nostalgia movement that also included American Graffiti, Happy Days, and the original Grease stage show. At least three times in 1973, one of Sha Na Na's opening acts was a relative newcomer named Bruce Springsteen. “People on our crew were saying, ‘You gotta check out this local guy, he's really good,'” Bauman says. “The stagehands said it. The woman putting the soft drinks in the cooler in the dressing room said it. So I stick my big nose out and see this guy with a saxophone player, and I listen to the first song and go, ‘Oh, that's pretty good.' You listen to the second song, ‘That's really good.'  By the fifth song, you're going, ‘ I hope we can follow this guy.'”

	Bauman left Sha Na Na in the Eighties, moving on to a career that came to include acting roles (one episode of Miami Vice), voiceover work (My Little Pony), a brief VJ stint (on VH1), and years of touring as part of his Bowzer-fronted oldies show. He became a proponent of the Truth in Music initiative, a series of bills passed in more than 30 states that helped shut down unauthorized versions of classic R&B and doo-wop groups of the Fifties and Sixties. “The names weren't properly protected, and [the original members] were just getting savaged by unscrupulous people who were pumping out dozens of Coasters and dozens of Drifters and dozens of Platters,” he says. “In the meantime, the audience is also being deceived, because they think they're going to see something that has some connection to the actual group, and they're actually just seeing a tribute show.” The bills have allowed state attorneys general to contact a venue about a pending “imposter” show, resulting in many being canceled.

	











	The turning point in Bauman's unexpected pivot to health-care advocate came with the 2000 presidential election, where George W. Bush prevailed over Al Gore. “It should never have gone to the United States Supreme Court,” he says. “I just said to myself, ‘Okay, I'm never sitting another one of these things out. I'm going to become involved in this.'” Bauman campaigned for John Kerry in 2004, and partook in rallies in support of Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. On social media he regularly went after waffling politicians like Maine senator Susan Collins, whom he dubbed “Coward Collins.”


	In the process, Brauman educated both himself and his assistance-inclined fan base about programs that Republicans have, to his disgust, called “entitlements.” “I understood that this was where my best usefulness was, and made myself an expert on senior issues, which you have to be if you're going to do this kind of work,” he says. “I start every speech that I give with, ‘I love the music of the Fifties and early Sixties. But that does not mean I actually want to return to the Fifties or the early Sixties.' I did not want to return to a time before Medicare was passed in 1965 when over 35 percent of American seniors had incomes below the poverty line.”


	After Bauman resurrected the Bowzer character in 1987, his touring schedule brought him several times to what was called the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City in the early 2000s. Back then, Bauman says he barely knew anything about the person whose name was on the building. “It was just some guy who owned a bunch of casinos,” he says. “I did make the remark at the time, when I played there three years in a row or something, ‘If this is a Taj Mahal, I'm a big red steam shovel.' The lamps were falling down. You could barely sleep in the bed. This was no kind of Taj Mahal. It was a dump.”


	But Bauman was destined to reacquaint himself with Trump, especially once he won the presidency the first time in 2016. “I was known to say I have no interest in him whatsoever,” Bauman says. “That [Atlantic City work] was just a booking. Now I have interest in him because I think he's a really awful person doing a really awful job. This is a guy who said, ‘I will not cut Medicaid,' and they're busy throwing at least 12 million people off it, and 17 million people altogether off of their health insurance. So, I mean, this guy just seems to be an inveterate liar.”

	











	Like many, Bauman says he struggles to understand Republican support for the bill that was signed into law last week. “Donald Trump's Big Ugly Bill makes the largest Medicaid cut in history, leaves kids and seniors to go hungry and blows up the national debt to give tax breaks to billionaires,” he says. “Why would anyone vote for that? I don't know. I can't answer that. Well, I can answer that. It's because their donors want the tax cut, and they gotta figure out how to pay for it. It's all money driven. It's disgusting.”


	So far this year, Bauman participated in almost a dozen events in swing districts with rural hospitals that could face closures once Medicaid cuts kick in. “This Big Ugly Bill is going to have terrible consequences for rural hospitals and nursing homes,” he says. “If this bill passes, and Medicaid is attacked in the way they're proposing and those hospitals close, don't think you're escaping because you go to another hospital. Your hospital is going to get overrun by patients from the hospitals that close. Everybody's going to be out on the street when that nursing home closes. This is something that affects everybody.”


	Now that Trump has signed the bill into law, Bauman is putting his hope in what the calls “our consolation prize,” a backlash that would benefit Democrats in next year's midterms. He's also intrigued by Elon Musk's proposal to start a third political party. “I have always felt that this is a coalition of the greediest among us and the most bigoted among us,” he says. “So anything that fractures that coalition is good.” And Bauman isn't happy with the email the Trump-led Social Security Administration sent out, claiming the bill “reaffirms President Trump's promise to protect Social Security”: “Someone like me is used to the hyperbolic marketing bullshit that's at the heart of his regime. That's exactly what this new Social Security propaganda actually is.”

	Early this year, Bauman wrapped up his long-running “Rock ‘n' Doo Wop Party,” a tour that featured him and other period legends like Chubby Checker and Gary “U.S” Bonds. The wear and tear of age had something to do with Bauman's retirement from the road, although he gives props to those even older veterans still out there: “If I had the repertoire of a Paul Simon, I would probably still be doing it too.”


	Bauman largely kept his political raps out of the show but admits that in the final performances in January, he couldn't help himself. “I started talking much more about Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and senior issues, because my audience is older, and these things apply to them in a very direct and not particularly partisan way,” he says. “A few maybe thought that the Bowzer character was a real guy stalking the streets of Brooklyn. I seem to get more positive feedback than not, and frankly, I don't care. The country is in a very dangerous spot where we're facing an attempt at an authoritarian takeover in every way, shape, matter, or form. And if I've lost some old fans over it, so be it. I would like to convince them that our country is worth saving.”

Billie Joe Armstrong celebrated the Fourth of July by criticizing the current president. During a concert at Rock Werchter in Belgium over the weekend, the Green Day frontman led the audience in a chant of “Fuck Donald Trump.”


	The punk band opened their set with “American Idiot,” during which Armstrong tweaked the lyrics to say “I'm not a part of the MAGA agenda”—a common alteration during recent Green Day shows. The musicians transitioned into “Holiday” and urged the crowd to join them as they shouted “fuck Donald Trump” during an extended jam.

	Armstrong has been a vocal critic of Trump and his policies, often using Green Day shows as an opportunity to call out the president and his allies. In June, the frontman told Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Trump administration to “fuck off” in support of the thousands of the Los Angeles-area residents who had been protesting raids against the immigrant community.

	











	“American Idiot” was originally written about George W. Bush's presidential administration. During New Year's Rockin' Eve this year, Green Day notably sang, “not a part of the MAGA agenda.” Following the election in January, Armstrong also took aim at Elon Musk. While performing “American Idiot” in Johannesburg, South Africa, the band switched the lyrics to fire at the Tesla and X CEO: “I'm not a part of the Elon agenda.”

Could Titan harbor life in its frozen ocean? New research suggests an alien biosphere the size of a dog, sparking a new frontier in the search for extraterrestrial life.

In a groundbreaking study, evolutionary biologist Antonin Affholder from the University of Arizona presents a theory about Titan, Saturn's largest moon. Titan could harbor life in its hidden underground ocean, though the entire biosphere might be no more substantial than a miniature poodle. This new revelation, based on research into the moon's potential for microbial life, contrasts with the once-hopeful expectations of abundant alien life on Titan. The study uses bioenergetic modeling to analyze the potential for life in Titan's subsurface ocean, offering a more realistic view of what life might look like in this distant world.

Titan's environment is unique in our Solar System, with a thick atmosphere rich in organic molecules, methane lakes, and a subterranean ocean that could harbor microbial life. However, this hypothetical biosphere is minuscule, limited by Titan's energy sources, which are insufficient for a thriving ecosystem. Life on Titan may consist of individual cells struggling for survival in an ocean that is vast but energy-poor.

Titan is a cold, mysterious world, distinguished by its thick, hazy atmosphere and unique organic compounds. The surface of Titan is covered in vast liquid methane lakes and rivers, while its subsurface is home to an ocean of water beneath an icy crust. This ocean is of particular interest to scientists, as it might contain the necessary conditions to support life, albeit in a form very different from what we are familiar with on Earth.

Titan's organic molecules are created when methane and nitrogen in the atmosphere undergo reactions induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. These molecules rain down onto the surface, accumulating as hydrocarbons that could potentially form the building blocks of life. The presence of these molecules makes Titan one of the most intriguing celestial bodies for researchers searching for extraterrestrial life.

In the study, researchers focused on the bioenergetics of Titan's ocean, analyzing how its unique chemistry might support life forms that could survive in the cold, anaerobic environment. The study reveals that the amount of energy available in the ocean may be too low to support large or complex ecosystems. However, even the simplest life forms, such as fermenting microbes, could find a niche in this cold world.

On Earth, fermentation is one of the oldest and simplest methods by which microorganisms generate energy, and it might be the key to survival for any life forms on Titan. Researchers propose that Titan's microbes might use fermentation to break down organic compounds like glycine, a molecule commonly found throughout the Universe. This process does not require oxygen and can provide the necessary energy for microbial life to thrive in an otherwise inhospitable environment.

Fermentation could be particularly suitable for Titan's conditions, where the available energy sources are meager, and oxygen is entirely absent. The discovery of microbial life based on fermentation would be an important step forward in understanding how life can adapt to extreme environments in our Solar System.

Despite these possibilities, the model shows that the total amount of biomass in Titan's ocean might only be a few kilograms, the equivalent of a small dog. This suggests that any life on Titan would be sparse, with far fewer cells per kilogram of water compared to Earth's oceans. The implications of this finding are significant, as it suggests that life on Titan, if it exists, is not only rare but also incredibly challenging to detect.

Given the small scale of potential life on Titan, the challenge of detecting it becomes even more daunting. With fewer than one microbial cell per kilogram of water, finding signs of life in Titan's ocean would be like searching for a needle in a haystack—an enormous haystack located 800 million miles away.

Despite these challenges, the research opens new avenues for exploring Titan's potential as a habitat for life. Future missions, such as NASA's Dragonfly drone, set to launch to Titan in the 2030s, may offer the best chance to probe Titan's surface and atmosphere for signs of organic chemistry and microbial activity. These missions will help scientists further understand whether life, albeit microscopic and sparse, could exist on Titan.

SINGAPORE, July 7 — A former massage therapist who claimed to possess supernatural powers and taught followers controversial beliefs — including justifying gambling and spiritual marriages — has been sentenced to four months' jail in Singapore for promoting a doctrine deemed contrary to Islamic law.

Mohd Razif Radi, 67, was convicted under the country's Administration of Muslim Law Act following a trial, The Straits Times reported today.

Delivering the sentence, District Judge Shaiffudin Saruwan said Razif's teachings were “linked to sins in Islam” and showed a “high degree of premeditation”.

He added that Razif's conduct had affected multiple victims and caused public unease and outcry.

During the trial, Razif was found to have conducted lessons in the early 2000s in which he claimed, among other things, that gambling profits from 4-D and Toto could be “cleansed” and used to fund businesses.

He also allegedly taught that a man and woman could be considered married via a “spiritual marriage”, bypassing Islamic rites.

According to The Straits Times, Razif had never been accredited under Singapore's Asatizah Recognition Scheme.

The Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) states that gambling is clearly prohibited under Islamic law and that spiritual marriages — which lack solemnisation, witnesses, and dowry — are considered deviant.

“In most cases, there are no limitations on the number of women ‘married' to a man through such deviant spiritual marriages,” Muis said.

“Such acts occur either between followers of a particular teaching or between the teacher and his students.”

Razif also claimed he could summon the spirit of “Mbah”, who he said was either Prophet Muhammad or descended from the Prophet's line.

One witness, under a gag order, testified that Razif would appear “possessed” during teachings.

“I expected a religious class, but it became like somebody entered (Razif's body),” the man told the court.

When speaking as “Mbah”, Razif reportedly adopted an Indonesian accent.

“The women would be stunned. They cried and kissed (Razif's) hand... This is against (our religion),” he said.

Another man said Razif taught he needed 13 wives. He claimed he had personally witnessed Razif take a female business owner as a “wife” in one such spiritual marriage.

He added that his own marriage broke down after he and his wife attended Razif's classes. She later sought a divorce and gained full custody of their daughter.

He said other men also experienced similar breakdowns after their partners followed Razif.

Razif denied all allegations when he took the stand in November 2024. He claimed he never conducted religious classes, had never acted as “Mbah”, and had not heard of spiritual marriages before his court proceedings.

Deputy Public Prosecutor Sruthi Boppana sought a sentence of five to seven months, arguing that Razif's conduct had disrupted family ties and was “motivated by self-interest”.

Defence lawyer Simon Tan urged for a fine instead, saying Razif had ceased conducting classes in 2012 and was in his “twilight years”.

Razif still faces a separate charge for allegedly running an unregistered religious school between 2017 and 2020 at Lina's Cafe in Jalan Pisang.

There's a feud going down over at Prime Video in the U.S. right now where two of the platform's newest titles are going head-to-head in a knock-down-drag-out fight that sees them duking it out for the top spot. Okay, so we might be making it sound much more dramatic than it is, but after a global streak that saw it fall from the number one position on Prime Video's Top 10, Countdown is slowly but surely making a comeback, starting in the United States where it's managed to fight off We Were Liars and reign supreme — if only for now.

The two productions couldn't be more different, which is what makes their viewership beef all the more interesting and entertaining. The former is a high-octane law enforcement-centered production that stars Supernatural and The Boys alum, Jensen Ackles, and Grey's Anatomy legend, Eric Dane. Meanwhile, We Were Liars is about as teen drama heavy as it gets, featuring the talents of Emily Alyn Lind (Doctor Sleep) as a young woman who grows up in extreme wealth, only to have her world flipped upside down by a traumatizing accident that causes her to lose her memory. Despite their massive and distinct differences, it seems there's plenty of space for both Countdown and We Were Liars, with audiences proving to be just as hungry for an action-packed thrill ride as they are for a whodunnit-style mystery with flavors of hits of yesteryear like Gossip Girl.

While viewers might be in agreement when it comes to their love for both Countdown and We Were Liars, critics are a completely different story. The former was one of the most eagerly anticipated projects of the summer, so it came as a huge shock to many when the reviews began pouring in. On Rotten Tomatoes, critics blasted Ackles' big turn as an action star, slamming it with a 36% approval rating against the audience's 72%. At Collider, Jeff Ewing fell in line with the latter group, rating it 8/10 and writing,

“As a whole, Countdown's cast and character dynamics make for an engaging watch. The design of the series—combining a whole multi-agency team of agents who don't play by the rules and have adept research and undercover skills—is a good premise for atypical plotting. The narrative also provides unexpected legs of the investigation that are often well-mined for a drama that stands out in a saturated subgenre. Taking advantage of characters' knacks for undercover work, for example, puts them in novel situations throughout the season. These routinely distinct events mean that Countdown gets to set up and utilize a wide array of set pieces for action, drama, and suspense, including car stunts, tense prison situations, computer investigations, and deep cover ops.”

Both Countdown and We Were Liars are now streaming on Prime Video.

Townsville's world-famous psychic crocodile, Krakatoa, predicts a Ford win

Australia also predicted to win PBR Tasman Cup on Friday night

NTI Townsville 500 begins on Friday, highlighted by 100km sprint race

Townsville's world-famous 5.2 metre, 800kg psychic crocodile, Krakatoa, has predicted a Ford win this weekend at the NTI Townsville 500.

The largest estuarine crocodile in Queensland who calls Townsville's famous Billabong Sanctuary home, was watched on by his famous girlfriend Madonna as he leaped up to select food tied to flags of both Ford and Chevrolet today - and the Blue Oval was the big fella's choice.

Krakatoa also selected a win for the Australian team in Friday night's Pro Bull Riding competition, that will be a world-first - where PBR joins a motorsport event for the first time. 

Cameron Griffiths, General Manager of Billabong Sanctuary, said: ""We use Krakatoa to predict the State of Origin, and generally he comes up pretty much honest, he picked every game last year.

""He missed out on the last one, so we thought we'd put it to the test for the Supercars on the weekend and for the bull riding.

""He likes a turducken, so we might give him something extra special if he picks both of them.""

This week's NTI Townsville 500 will also serve as the penultimate round of the Repco Sprint Cup, with vital points on the line before a Sprint Champion is crowned and locks in the first guaranteed place in the inaugural Repco Supercars Championship Finals Series.

Red Bull Ampol Racing's Chevrolet ace Broc Feeney leads the Supercars table by 183 points from teammate and defending Supercars Champion Will Brown.

In a global first, Professional Bull Riders (PBR) Australia will bring its renowned, high-adrenaline format to the heart of the Supercars precinct with the first-ever Australia vs New Zealand PBR showdown.

The Friday night spectacle will see elite riders from both countries go head-to-head in front of a roaring crowd, with the bullring set up behind the Supercars paddock and access included for all same-day ticket holders.

The event will also play host to Summernats Goes Troppo, an unmissable daily showcase of burnouts, drift cars, dyno runs, and elite show vehicles, led by more than 20 purpose-built burnout beasts and drift stars including Leteisha Chun Tie and Mercurial Mouse.

MotorEx Alley brings the country's biggest car culture expo to North Queensland for the first time, with the Horsepower Hero dyno show, live Flying Spanners engine build battles, signing sessions, expert panels and special guest builds including Joe Bauer's 3000hp Dodge Charger.

Street Machine Magazine will stage one of its most high-profile show and shine displays, packed with the toughest Aussie street cars on the scene.

Fresh off a sold-out national tour, 2024 Australian Idol winner Dylan Wright will headline the NTI Townsville 500's live music program, performing hits from his #1 country EP.

NTI Townsville 500 Event Manager Matt Ramsden said: ""The track build is well underway, we're getting very, very close now. Boundary Street and Charters Towers Road are shut, so we're full swing into the build.

""Things are really starting to come to life down on site, and we can't wait to open the doors on Friday.

""We actually saw a couple of people at the Cowboys game on Saturday night in racing gear, so that's a good sign that a lot of people are hanging around for both weekends, really taking in the best of North Queensland and the Townsville region.

""Ticket sales are tracking on really well, expecting a late surge this week, and looking forward to the excitement of the Townsville 500.""

All same-day ticket holders will be able to access the entire Reid Park precinct.

Practice begins on Friday morning ahead of Friday Qualifying and the 100km race.

The event is live and ad free on Fox Sports and Kayo, with the Seven Network broadcasting Saturday and Sunday action live. Check local guides for details.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","Jeffrey Epstein didn't have a ‘client list,' committed suicide, DOJ, FBI reveal in findings that debunk conspiracy theories","https://nypost.com/2025/07/06/us-news/jeffrey-epstein-didnt-have-a-client-list-committed-suicide-doj-fbi-reveal-in-findings-that-debunk-conspiracy-theories/","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 02:12:00 GMT","

Notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein didn't keep a supposed “client list,” and he was not murdered during his short stay in a Manhattan lockup, the Justice Department and FBI reportedly concluded in a joint probe.

The investigation, the results of which were detailed in a memo obtained by Axios, also found no evidence that Epstein “blackmailed prominent individuals.”

The Trump administration plans to release a video to prove the agencies' findings on Epstein's 2019 death, which bred mounds of conspiracy theories.

“He's the only person in there and the only person coming out. You can see it,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in late May. 

The video falls in line with the medical examiner's assessment post-mortem that Epstein committed suicide, according to the memo.

The medical examiner's conclusions were contested by Epstein's surviving family, who turned to a forensic pathologist who determined that a homicide was far more probable based on the evidence. 

No one else involved in the Epstein case will face charges, according to the memo, beyond his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving 20 years for child sex trafficking and other related crimes. 

President Trump previously promised to release the apparently debunked “client list” during his re-election campaign.

Trump has asserted that he had never visited Epstein's notorious private island, where scores of underage girls and young women were allegedly abused. 

But the president has said “a lot of people did” — whom he was willing to unmask. 

Back in February, Trump's DOJ released Epstein's contact list as part of a long-awaited trove of documents connected to the notorious sex predator.

Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Alec Baldwin and Mick Jagger were among the high-profile names on Epstein's contact list. 

But the hyped-up February release was panned by critics as containing little to no new information about Epstein's case. 

Epstein's demise just 36 days into his stay at the Metropolitan Correctional Center has been the source of rampant conspiracy theories for nearly a decade, including rumors that some of the rich and famous on whom he had incriminating information arranged for him to be murdered. 

The disgraced mogul first pleaded guilty in 2008 for soliciting underage sex and was placed on the sex offenders list. 

Epstein served just 13 months of an 18-month sentence in a county jail, when he only spent one day a week physically at the facility and the other six out on “work release.” 

In 2014, Virginia Giuffre alleged in a sworn affidavit that she was sex-trafficked and even used as a “sex slave” for years by Epstein and Maxwell for their own use and for others', including Prince Andrew, which the former royal continues to deny today.

The $2.7 billion acquisition of Neiman Marcus by Saks Fifth Avenue's owner last year was supposed to create a luxury powerhouse. Instead, both department stores are losing customers and sales to competitors including Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom. 

Sales at Saks Fifth Avenue fell 16% during the quarter that ended in June from a year earlier, according to Bloomberg Second Measure, which tracks debit and credit purchases. During the same period, combined sales at Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman sank 10%. The slowdown accelerated over the three months, with June showing the biggest drop at the three retailers.

U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened an additional 10% tariff on countries that orient themselves along the ""Anti-American policies of BRICS.""

Trump's announcement, which did not elaborate on any specific policy of BRICS, came as the group's meeting is underway in Rio de Janeiro.

The bloc's leaders appeared to take aim at Trump's sweeping tariff policies in a joint statement on Sunday, warning against ""unjustified unilateral protectionist measures, including the indiscriminate increase of reciprocal tariffs.""

Without calling out the U.S., the leaders voiced ""serious concerns about the rise of unilateral tariff and non-tariff measures which distort trade and are inconsistent with WTO rules,"" warning that the ""proliferation of trade-restrictive actions"" threaten to disrupt the global economy and worsen the existing economic disparities.

""Any Country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of BRICS, will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% Tariff. There will be no exceptions to this policy,"" Trump said in a post Sunday evening stateside on Truth Social.

Trump could have been provoked by the BRICS leaders' joint statement taking a thinly veiled swipe at his tariff policies, said Stephen Olson, former U.S. trade negotiator and current visiting senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.

By ""anti-American"" policies, the president may be referring to ""the desire expressed by BRICS members to move beyond a U.S.-led world order in finance and global governance,"" said Olson, adding that how that alignment will be assessed was ""anyone's guess.""

This year's BRICS host country, Brazil, did not respond to CNBC's request for comments.

The BRICS group of developing nations also offered symbolic backing to fellow member, Iran, condemning a series of military strikes on the country, without naming Israel or the U.S which carried out the military operation.

The bloc includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Iran. The grouping describes itself as ""a political and diplomatic coordination forum for countries from the Global South and for coordination in the most diverse areas.""

The bloc seeks to challenge Western-dominated institutions of global economic governance, as well as to supplant the U.S. dollar's role in the global economy, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

This year, Chinese President Xi Jinping sent Premier Li Qiang to the BRICS meeting in his absence, while Russian President Vladimir Putin, who faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court, attended online.

In response to Trump's threat of a 10% extra duty, a spokesperson for Chinese Foreign Ministry said at a regular press briefing Monday that China opposed any action of using tariffs as ""a tool to coerce others.""

""China has been consistent in opposing any tariff war, trade war,"" the spokesperson said, adding that ""arbitrarily slapping tariffs does not serve the interests of any party."" That's according to CNBC's translation of her comments in Mandarin.

Separately, Trump confirmed that the U.S. will start delivering letters on Monday, detailing country-specific tariff rates and any agreements reached with various trading partners. That affirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's comments over the weekend.

The Trump administration has said that tariffs announced in April will take effect on Aug. 1, instead of July 9, for countries that have not reached an agreement with the U.S.

Bessent rejected the idea that Aug. 1 was yet another new tariff deadline. ""We are saying this is when it's happening, if you want to speed things up, have at it, if you want to go back to the old rate that's your choice,"" Bessent said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

In April, Trump announced a 90-day pause on the steep tariffs he had unveiled just days prior on most trading partners. That pause is due to expire on Wednesday, sparking concern among investors and U.S. trading partners.

Follow:


            The Trump administration will no longer consider Syria's Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the group led by Syria's interim president, a foreign terrorist organization, according to a notice from Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
    


            The revocation of the foreign terrorist designation for the group, which is also known as the al-Nusra Front, comes amid a growing rapprochement between Washington and Damascus.
    


            The revocation was signed on June 23 and will take effect on Tuesday, according to the notice from Rubio. The draft was posted in the federal register on Monday.
    


            In a separate statement Monday, Rubio said the revocation of the designation “follows the announced dissolution of HTS and the Syrian government's commitment to combat terrorism in all its forms.”
    


            “This action also builds on the momentum of the June 30 Executive Order ‘Providing for the Revocation of Syria Sanctions' and recognizes the positive actions taken by the new Syrian government under President Ahmed al-Sharaa,” he said. “This FTO revocation is an important step in fulfilling President Trump's vision of a stable, unified, and peaceful Syria.”
    


            The United States and Syria have not yet re-established diplomatic relations, although a number of administration officials have met with Syrian officials, including interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa.
    


            Al-Sharaa is the leader of the HTS, which was was formed out of a former al Qaeda affiliate. HTS, with Al-Sharaa at its helm, led the shocking ouster of Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.
    


            Last week, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to formally end US sanctions on Syria, following an announcement earlier in June that he would lift sanctions in order to help the country rebuild after years of war.
    


            As part of the executive order, the administration was reviewing Syria's state sponsor of terrorism and foreign terrorist organization designations, a senior administration official said. The state sponsor of terrorism designation has been in place since 1979.
    


            The executive order also directed the State Department to review the Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) designations on the HTS and al-Sharaa. It is unclear if the Trump administration is also lifting the SDGT designations. CNN has reached out to the State Department for additional information.

Western states led by the US provoke wars to make profit and preserve a “decaying” unipolar world order, Bolivian President Luis Arce has told RT. In contrast, BRICS countries represent an emerging, more equal global order, he said.

Arce cited the recent Iran-Israel escalation and the Ukraine conflict, alleging that Western officials deliberately exaggerated threats – such as claims that Russia could attack the EU – to provoke fear and justify escalation.

“These claptrap statements that provoked the war between Russia and Ukraine are the same statements that led to mutual attacks between Israel and Iran. They follow the same logic, they want to provoke the BRICS countries to take retaliatory actions,” Arce told RT at the BRICS Summit in Brazil.

“We all understand that wars benefit one country – the US, which is the main supplier of weapons. This sector... stimulates the American economy, which is in decline. The Americans have always sought to unleash wars, because for them it is a way to solve economic problems,” Arce added.

He claimed that the US and EU realize they are losing influence and are trying to block emerging power centers.

“The BRICS countries are playing an increasingly important role… There is a clear struggle between the old stagnant bloc of the US and Europe on one side and the emerging bloc of BRICS countries on the other,” the Bolivian leader stated.

Arce said his country rejects unipolarity and promotes multilateralism.

“We no longer believe that the planet should be dominated by one country… The fact that more and more countries want to join the BRICS group is a convincing proof that the world embraces the principle of multilateralism,” the Bolivian leader stated. He added that BRICS does not make subordinates of its members, but allows them all to benefit from mutual cooperation.

BRICS was founded by Brazil, Russia, India, and China in 2006, and later added South Africa, Egypt, Iran, Ethiopia, the UAE, and Indonesia. At last year's summit in Kazan, the group introduced a ‘partner country' status after receiving over 30 membership applications.

In their declaration at the Rio summit that started on Sunday, BRICS leaders backed a multipolar world, UN Security Council reform, and fairer global finance. They called for IMF and World Bank reforms, stronger trade among BRICS states, expanded use of local currencies, and alternative payment systems.

Kayapó chief tells in memoir of seeing former president in his dreams and of warning Lula not to repeat past mistakes

Brazil's most revered Indigenous leader, Raoni Metuktire, has said he believes that one of the former president Jair Bolsonaro's goals while in office was to “exterminate” the country's Indigenous peoples.

According to the Kayapó chief, the far-right populist “encouraged invasions, mining and deforestation” in order to hand Indigenous lands over to the kubẽ (non-Indigenous people).

“He really wanted to exterminate us,” Metuktire says in his new book, Memórias do Cacique (The Chief's Memoirs), recently released in Portuguese, its cover featuring Metuktire with his trademark lip plate and bright yellow feather headdress.

“But Indigenous peoples across Brazil united to resist his government,” he says, adding that “from now on, every president elected in Brazil must respect Indigenous peoples”.

Metuktire, 88, has gained international recognition since the 1980s for his efforts to combat environmental destruction and protect Indigenous lands, and he became a frequent target of Bolsonaro, whose administration coincided with a sharp rise in deforestation in the Amazon.

In the book, the Indigenous leader says Bolsonaro began appearing in his dreams towards the end of the president's term. “I told him [in the dream]: ‘Just wait, you'll be out of the presidency. I'll remove you,'” he says.

The Guardian contacted Bolsonaro for comment but did not receive a response.

In January 2023, Metuktire stood alongside Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva as the leftist took office for a third term, having defeated Bolsonaro in the 2022 election.

In the book, the chief recalls telling Lula that he could not “repeat the mistakes of the past”. He says Indigenous communities were “deceived” during Lula's previous administration, particularly with the construction of the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam on the Xingu River.

Despite his criticism over the dam's construction, the overall tone towards Lula is one of trust and cautious hope.

The book, not yet scheduled for English translation, is the result of more than 80 hours of interviews given to Metuktire's “grandchildren”, a term that includes biological descendants and younger members of the community who are not blood-related.

The interviews were conducted and transcribed in the Indigenous language Mẽbêngôkre and translated into Portuguese with support from Fernando Niemeyer, an anthropologist who led the research for the book.

Through this work, Niemeyer was able to determine Metuktire's year of birth – until now only an estimate, as there were no official records – as 1937. The exact date, however, remains uncertain.

The chief recalls moments including his tour across 13 countries in the late 1980s alongside the rock star Sting to denounce the destruction of Brazil's forests and raise funds for the demarcation of Indigenous lands.

Metuktire remembers being at Sting's home when they saw on the news that the environmentalist Chico Mendes had been murdered by ranchers illegally occupying protected land.

“After lunch, Sting came over to me and said: ‘Let's talk. Raoni, I'm worried about you. They've just killed Chico Mendes because he was fighting for the forest. Find people you trust to manage this money, and take care of yourself in this struggle,'” the chief says.

The narrative does not follow a linear chronology. Instead, the book weaves together personal accounts, myths, dreams and songs – a deliberate choice, Niemeyer explains, to preserve the way Metuktire sees and relates to the world.

“For centuries, our colonial tradition worked to erase Indigenous memory,” the anthropologist said, noting that there were still very few autobiographies by Brazilian Indigenous leaders. “Until quite recently, the ones writing about Indigenous people were white – and there were practically no Indigenous voices writing about whites.”

The memoir is also a call to arms and unity for the younger generations, with frequent scoldings for, in Metuktire's view, drifting away from tradition.

“I still feel strong enough to keep fighting,” Metuktire says, “but my grandchildren must carry this struggle forward.” He is expected to name his successor as chief next month.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

New traffic lights for Euros

Authorities in the Swiss city of Basel have installed 12 altered pedestrian crossing lights featuring a green woman kicking a soccer ball at locations frequented by soccer fans while the country hosts the nearly month-long UEFA Women's European Championship. Some are located near the soccer stadium, others near the train station. “They will stay until the end of the Women's Euro — maybe even a few days longer,” Basel Construction and Transport Department spokeswoman Nicole Ryf-Stocker said. The idea and design were provided by the St. Gallen Construction and Environment Department, while the lights were manufactured by the same company that manufactures Basel's traffic lights, she said. Basel is to host the final on July 27, among other games.

FIFA cuts ticket prices

FIFA slashed standard ticket prices for the semi-final between Chelsea and Fluminense at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, today to US$13.40 from US$473.90 last week. FIFA has used dynamic pricing for the 63-game tournament. Standard ticket prices for tomorrow's semi-final between Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid in New Jersey start at US$199.60. FIFA had dropped ticket prices to US$11.15 for a quarter-final in Orlando, Florida, between Fluminense and Al-Hilal, and in Philadelphia between Chelsea and Palmeiras. The dramatic drop in prices was first reported by The Athletic. Many matches during the tournament have had sparse crowds. Real Madrid have been an exception, drawing at least 60,000 for all five of their matches, including 76,611 for their quarter-final win on Saturday over Borussia Dortmund in New Jersey.

NBA 

Durant to join Rockets

Kevin Durant's trade from the Phoenix Suns to the Houston Rockets was agreed upon in principle on Sunday as part of an NBA-record seven-team deal. The Rockets would also welcome back Clint Capela in a sign-and-trade deal with Atlanta, the Athletic and ESPN reported, citing unnamed sources. Also involved in the blockbuster transfer were the Brooklyn Nets, Golden State Warriors, Minnesota Timberwolves and Los Angeles Lakers. Durant, a 15-time NBA All-Star forward and four-time league scoring leader, turns 37 in September. The 2014 NBA most valuable player won NBA titles in 2017 and 2018. Capela, 31, played his first six NBA seasons in Houston and the past five for the Hawks.

Ed Fiori dies aged 72

Ed Fiori, who for 13 years was the only player to rally from a 54-hole deficit to beat Tiger Woods on the PGA Tour, died on Sunday, the tour said on its Web site. He was 72. The tour said Fiori had been battling cancer. It provided no other details. A four-time winner on the PGA Tour, no victory was more memorable than the 1996 Quad City Classic, now the John Deere Classic. Three tournaments into his pro career, a 20-year-old Woods had a one-shot lead over Fiori going into the final round at Oakwood Country Club. Woods had a quadruple bogey on the fourth hole and a four-putt double bogey on the seventh hole. He shot 72 to tie for fifth, four shots behind Fiori. Woods won two starts later in Las Vegas. He did not lose a 54-hole lead in another PGA Tour event until 2009.

Having claimed the last two Ballon d'Or awards, Barcelona midfielder Bonmati is the game's biggest star at present, so her absence in the final days before the start of Euro 2025 is a major setback. 
The 27-year-old came down with a fever in training last week, and was subsequently hospitalized and diagnosed with viral meningitis. 
Bonmati was discharged on Sunday and joined up with                                    


HSIEH ADVANCES:
                                        In the women's doubles, Taiwan's Hsieh Su-wei was to play in the second round last night, but Taiwan's Ray Ho exited in the men's doubles                                        It is more than 10 years since Grigor Dimitrov reached his sole Wimbledon semi-final and back then it still seemed a reasonable bet that the Bulgarian once dubbed “Baby Federer” would win a Grand Slam title.
There were semi-final runs at the US Open and Australian Open after that, but it has never quite happened and despite him still being ranked No. 21, it most likely never will.
Dimitrov, 34, remains one of the most stylish players on the circuit though, with his elegant single-handed backhand and smooth all-court game a rare reminder of how tennis was before the power merchants turned                                    


TAIWANESE WIN:
                                        Chan Hao-ching and Wu Fang-hsien and their partners won their first-round matches in the women's doubles at the All England Lawn Tennis Club                                        Late-night finishes and five-set matches are becoming a habit for Taylor Fritz at Wimbledon this year.
On Wednesday, he wrapped up his win over Gabriel Diallo before the match was suspended — making sure the fifth-seeded American would not have to come back on court for a fourth straight day.
Fritz overcame a bloodied elbow to win 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/0), 4-6, 6-3 on No. 1 Court a day after he finished off another five-set win over Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in a match that was halted on Monday at about 10:15pm after Fritz forced a fifth set with Wimbledon's 11pm curfew looming.

			Israeli PM's latest White House visit billed as a ‘celebration' of Iran strikes

Donald Trump has billed Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the White House on Monday as a “celebration” of the strikes on Iran.

But it will also come with trickier talks about a ceasefire in Gaza, and what comes next in the Middle East.

Those two strands illustrate the complex relationship between an America First president and an Israeli ally worried about how Mr Trump has gone it alone when it has suited him.

When Mr Trump welcomes Mr Netanyahu into the Oval Office, he will know the Israeli prime minister holds the key to unlocking his grand vision for the Middle East.

A normalisation deal between the Jewish state and Saudi Arabia is the great unfinished business of the Abraham Accords brokered in his first term, which saw Israel establish diplomatic links with the UAE, Bahrain and others.

Mohammed Bin Salman, the Saudi Crown Prince, has made it clear that there can be no hope of that until the war is ended and, at the very least, the Palestinian people are put on a meaningful path to statehood.

At times, the delicate balancing act Mr Trump must perform – supporting Israel, while being mindful of the views of America's Arab allies – has generated headlines about rifts over bombing Iran or the need to end the war in Gaza.

But insiders say the relationship – between two men who see themselves in each other, and have sometimes used misdirection to hide their mutual plans – is closer than you think.

“Netanyahu, you know, he's sort of like Trump,” said a source close to the White House describing Mr Trump's view of their connection. “He's disliked, hated by a lot of people, but he wins.”

The low point in their relationship came after the 2020 election, he added, when Mr Netanyahu congratulated Joe Biden on his victory.

“I haven't spoken to him since. F--- him,” Mr Trump was quoted as saying at the time.

Yet Mr Netanyahu now holds a privileged place. He is making his third visit to the White House in less than six months.

Top of the agenda will be what comes next in stifling Iran's nuclear programme and a deal to release the last hostages held by Hamas.

Mr Trump has ramped up expectations of a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, although a source said the meeting on Monday was being “low keyed”, without high hopes of a major breakthrough.

While most of the opposition to Mr Trump's ceasefire deal has come from Hamas, the group on Friday indicated that it was feeling “positive” about the terms and was considering laying down arms, according to a Saudi news outlet.

Either way, Mr Netanyahu's visit comes after a rollercoaster of highs and lows in his relationship with the American president.

During his first term, Mr Trump went out of his way to line up with the Israeli prime minister.

He moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognising the disputed city as the capital of Israel, and leading a drive to normalise relations with Arab states.

Their meeting on Monday comes during one of their public highs.

After American B-2 bombers joined Israeli warplanes in conducting strikes on Iranian nuclear targets, Mr Trump weighed in on Israel's domestic politics.

He called for authorities to drop the “ridiculous witch hunt” and charges of corruption and fraud against Mr Netanyahu.

“Bibi and I just went through HELL together,” Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social, using the prime minister's nickname. “Bibi could not have been better, sharper, or stronger in his LOVE for the incredible Holy Land.”

From Mr Netenyahu's perspective, on top of the base-level reliance Israel has for the US, for weapons shipments above all, he owes the president for weighing in so meaningfully against Iran.

He has never been under greater pressure than he is at this moment to defy his ultra-nationalist coalition partners, who could topple his government, by wrapping up the military campaign in Gaza.

The veteran prime minister will also be aware that Mr Trump has potentially more to offer him in the form of vocal opposition to his corruption trial.

Just by welcoming the Israeli leader to Washington, he has kept Mr Netanyahu out of court for a second consecutive week.

When, politically, you survive day to day, as Mr Netanyahu does, that is a win in itself.

The current show of strength marks a turnaround from the early months of Mr Trump's second term when he appeared to be distancing himself from Israel.

He did not visit Israel during a trip to the Middle East, and he cut a deal with the Houthis and ended US bombing of Yemen even as the Iranian proxy group continued firing on Israel.

His officials also negotiated directly with Hamas to secure the release of an American hostage from Gaza.

Perhaps the lowest point came in April during Mr Netanyahu's second visit to the White House this year.

The US president announced he was opening direct negotiations with Iran over its nuclear programme.

Josh Hammer, author of Israel and Civilization: The Fate of the Jewish Nation and the Destiny of the West, said none of their public spats were evidence of a fundamental rift between the two men.

Rather, it was Mr Trump acting on America First promises to stay out of foreign wars.

“He is someone who campaigns as something of a deal maker and a peacemaker,” he said.

“So I think that the tension for him is balancing out those campaign promises with his other instincts, which are to be a defender of American interests, defender of allies' interests, and defender, more broadly speaking, of the Judaeo-Christian West against the bad guys, the Islamists and so forth.”

At first, Mr Trump signalled opposition to Israeli strikes on Iran.

“I prefer the more friendly path,” he told reporters last month as he warned that attacks would likely undermine any chance of talks.

He continued pushing for a deal even as Mr Netanyahu launched warplanes and as his own B-2s went into action.

There was no rift between the two men, said the source close to the White House.

“Since the election, everything you saw … like any disagreements between them, that was pure misdirection,” he said.

The American B-2 bombers delivered their bunker-busting payloads without coming under fire and returned safely.

But signs of tension emerged days later when a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Iran quickly came apart.

A furious Mr Trump declared they “don't know what the f--- they're doing”.

That will all be forgotten when Mr Netanyahu arrives at the White House.

Gil Troy, an Israeli-American scholar of American presidential history and Zionism, said it was just one more twist in a relationship that was much closer than it looked from the outside.

He cited comments made by the American president recently when he said Mr Netanyahu had been treated “very unfairly” by the Israeli people, mirroring language he has used about his own treatment.

“When Donald Trump identifies with you, not just supports you, but says, I am you and you are me, that shows a kind of deep Trumpian bonding, very much in the style of a family businessman, very much in the style of a monarch, very much in the style of Donald Trump,” he said.

The two leaders sit down on Monday after the first round of formal indirect talks in Doha ended without agreement.

Hamas had already demanded revisions on the scope of the Israeli withdrawal in the event of a deal, as well as the size of humanitarian zones and the distribution methods of aid, which Israel had criticised as unacceptable.

It was reported on Monday that the Israeli team in Doha lacked the authority to strike a deal.

However, it had been thought that on the main meat of a 60-day ceasefire, the parties were broadly in step.

Although details are unclear, the proposal was believed to include a roughly five-stage release of living and dead hostages across the two months.

By the end of that period, roughly half of the living hostages – 10 – would have made it home. This would be accompanied by the release of, presumably, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, a significant Israeli withdrawal and a dramatic increase in the volume of aid.

The key sticking point, as it has been since January, is likely to be what happens after – whether Israel will even entertain the idea of ending the war without defeating Hamas.

Mr Netanyahu has sounded bellicose on this in recent days. However, he loses nothing by appearing resolute.

The real test will come when he sits down with Mr Trump and finds out just how fiercely his great patron in Washington is demanding an end to the fighting.

That is likely to be when the talks in Doha begin in practice.

Analysts say private jet owners will be able to write off the full cost of their aircraft in the first year of purchase.

The Republican budget measure that U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law late last week contains a provision that analysts say will allow private jet owners to write off the full cost of their aircraft in the first year of purchase, a boon to the ultra-rich that comes as millions of people are set to lose healthcare under the same legislation.

FlyUSA, a private aviation provider, gushed in a blog post that with final passage of the unpopular budget reconciliation package, “business jet ownership has never looked more fiscally attractive or more fun to explain to your accountant.”

The law, crafted by congressional Republicans and approved with only GOP support, permanently restores a major corporate tax break known as 100% bonus depreciation, which allows businesses to deduct the costs of certain assets in the first year of purchase rather than writing them off over time.

Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.

Forbes noted that the bonus depreciation policy “applies to a slew of qualified, physical business expenses which depreciate over time, such as machinery and company cars, but the policy is often associated with big-ticket luxury items, such as private aircraft, and its institution last decade led to a boom in jet sales.”

Chuck Collins, director of the Program on Inequality at the Institute for Policy Studies, called bonus depreciation “a massive tax break for billionaires and centi-millionaires that use the most polluting form of transportation on the planet.”

“A corporation purchasing a $50 million private jet could potentially deduct the entire $50 million from their taxes in the year of the purchase, rather than spreading the deduction over many years,” Collins wrote. “This amounts to a massive taxpayer subsidy, as ordinary taxpayers pick up the tab for the private jet industry and billionaire high flyers.”

“Subsidizing more private jets on a warming planet is reckless and indefensible,” he added.

The National Business Aviation Association, a lobbying group for the private aviation industry, celebrated passage of the Republican legislation, specifically welcoming the bonus depreciation policy as “effective for incentivizing aircraft purchase.” (The Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy argues that “depreciation tax breaks have never been shown to encourage more capital investment.”)

Meanwhile, communities across the United States are bracing for the law's deep cuts to Medicaid and federal nutrition assistance, which are expected to impose damaging strains on state budgets and strip food benefits and health coverage from millions of low-income Americans.

“Trump and congressional Republicans have certainly delivered for the billionaire class,” said Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen. “This is certainly one of the cruelest bills in American history, backtracking on the country's painfully slow history of expanding healthcare coverage and, equally remarkably, taking food away from the hungry.”

“That's a lot of needless suffering just to make the richest Americans richer,” he added.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has held a press conference at the 17th annual BRICS summit. The two-day event kicked off on Sunday in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which currently holds the group's rotating presidency.

This year, the summit focuses on multilateral cooperation, as well as global development and governance issues. Speaking during the second session of the summit earlier on Monday, Lavrov said the group has been striving for “a more stable global economic architecture that is built on the principles of universality, transparency, and non-discrimination.” 

The top Russian diplomat also called for a fundamental reform of international institutions, arguing that many have long since degraded into neo-colonial tools of control. The emerging multipolar world is “not a choice but rather an objective reality,” he stated, adding that the new model is set to succeed “the outdated neo-liberal model that actually builds on neo-colonial practices” dominated by “the so-called developed states of the West.” 

BRICS was founded primarily as a trade and development group in 2006 by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, with South Africa joining in 2010. Over the past year, the group has extended full membership to Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates, and Indonesia, as well as welcoming ten partner states. 

This year's summit brings together around 4,000 participants from 37 nations, including senior dignitaries from member states, partner countries, and international institutions.

Lavrov has urged the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to take responsibility for its assessment of Iran's nuclear program, which the UN agency released shortly before the recent Israeli strikes against the country. The agency must avoid politicizing the nuclear issue and “strictly adhere to the responsibilities it is vested with,” the Russian foreign minister stressed. 

“These assessments have been widely perceived as ambiguous. Unlike previous [IAEA] reports, they are open to interpretation to imply that Iran is not fulfilling its obligations in good faith.”



Asked about the recent deadly attacks on Russian passenger trains, which have been attributed to Ukraine and now condemned in the joint BRICS statement, Lavrov said Russia was not seeking any international help in investigating the incidents.

“Such attacks have long been banned by numerous conventions... As for bringing those responsible to justice, we are not trying to throw this topic into the international discussion. We are doing this ourselves... No one must escape responsibility,” the top diplomat said.

Lavrov has dismissed the accusations repeatedly voiced by US President Donald Trump that BRICS is an anti-American group. Trump has threatened to impose an additional 10% tariff on any country that “aligns itself” with BRICS and its allegedly “anti-American policies.” The Russian foreign minister has suggested that the claims are yet another sign of the erosion of the unipolar world order. 

“No one knows when and why someone ends up being punished. Even those considered to be allies of the US cannot feel safe,” Lavrov said.



The Russian foreign minister has dismissed concerns voiced in the West that the expansion of BRICS could erode its unity and ultimately derail the group, stating that BRICS has been built upon the principles of equality and mutual respect. 

“I believe they are reflecting… on the expansion of NATO, which did nothing good for anyone, including, in my opinion, the members of the military bloc themselves. The strife is deepening within it… since more and more nations seek to act based not on some ideological dogmas imposed by their master but on their national interests,” Lavrov stated.

Asked about the extended format of the summit, which has brought together representatives of some 37 nations, including ten official partner countries, the Russian foreign minister said that the big turnout is not surprising.

“Unlike guest-nations, [partner] countries are set to participate in all BRICS events, not only summits or ministerial events, but the majority of sectoral meetings as well, dedicated to various economic, humanitarian and other issues,” Lavrov explained.

BRICS is working to create a “more stable, more fair, multipolar world order, which would rely on the principles outlined in the UN Charter,” Lavrov has said.

DTE Energy had denied involvement in dark money non-profits, but court documents show a $100,000 donation

Newly released court documents show power utility DTE Energy knowingly contributed $100,000 to a dark money non-profit that helped sabotage Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer's Covid lockdown policies.

The documents contradict previous DTE statements that claimed the utility was not involved with the donation.

In January 2023, the Guardian detailed how a DTE-affiliated dark money non-profit financially contributed to the successful repeal of Whitmer's emergency order powers. The campaign, coordinated with state Republican leadership, helped bring about an end to Covid lockdowns and policies.

Peter Ternes, then a DTE Energy spokesperson, twice emphatically denied the company's involvement. In late 2022, he told a Guardian reporter, “DTE unequivocally is not financially supporting” the campaign to kill Whitmer's emergency order powers, led by Unlock Michigan, and made an almost identical statement when asked in 2020.

New emails, however, show a DTE employee coordinated the $100,000 contribution. The dark money non-profit and Unlock Michigan leadership referred to it as a “DTE donation” and “$100,000 DTE check”, emails show.

The emails are part of a criminal case over alleged Unlock Michigan campaign finance violations and are not directly related to DTE.

The “revelatory” emails illuminate how DTE “deploys dark money in Michigan”, said Karlee Weinmann, research and communications manager with the utility industry watchdog Energy and Policy Institute. The group detailed the emails in a new report.

“The emails raise questions about the appropriateness of DTE's political spending and activity,” Weinmann added.

Michigan was a global flashpoint in the cultural and political fight over how governments should handle Covid. Whitmer's lockdowns were effective at controlling the virus's spread, but rightwing opposition to the restrictions culminated with multiple demonstrations and armed protesters storming the state legislature in mid-2020.

While the Covid restrictions are over, dark money groups remain powerful players in state and national politics, and the emails show how lax transparency laws shield them as they move funding for politicians or causes.

Utilities generally opposed lockdowns in 2020, industry observers have said. During the first wave of Covid restrictions, many voluntarily stopped or were required to cease shutting off service to financially struggling customers.

Sources initially alerted a Guardian reporter to the donation around the time it was made in late 2020, but no public record of it was available at the time.

Internal Revenue Service records confirming the donation became public in late 2021. They show the funds went from a DTE-affiliated dark money group, Michigan Energy First (MEF), to another dark money non-profit called Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility (MCRF). The latter served as a primary funder of the Unlock Michigan campaign, donating about $1.8m in 2020.

Though DTE lobbyists served on MEF's board, then DTE spokesperson Ternes had steadfastly insisted it was a separate entity and there was no coordination between the two. Ternes also said DTE did not give donations to MEF.

In an email sent on Wednesday, DTE spokesperson Jill Wilmot conceded that the company gave money to MEF, representing a shift from its past statements. Still, DTE denied that it knew what MEF did with the donation.

“While DTE has contributed to Michigan Energy First (MEF) in the past, we can't speak on behalf of MEF or the contributions the organization makes,” the spokesperson said.

However, the new emails show DTE did know how MEF would spend the money. The company's corporate and government affairs chief of staff, Pam Headley, in 2020 facilitated the $100,000 donation from MEF to MCFR, emails show.

MEF's board president at the time was Renze Hoeksema, a now-retired DTE lobbyist. Headley was a DTE employee with no known role with MEF.

Headley sent an email from her DTE email account during business hours to MCFR with the subject line “RE: Contribution from Michigan Energy First”.

The email shows how Headley coordinated the DTE donation: “Renze asked me to let you know that today the Michigan Energy First Board approved a $100,000 contribution to Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility.” She included a request for an invoice and closed out the email with her DTE email signature.

The criminal filings also include emails between MCFR and Republican Senate leadership working with Unlock Michigan. They refer to the donation as being from DTE Energy.

One email states, “I think I'm getting the $100,000 tomorrow from DTE.” Another from the following day states, “Unlock Michigan update: $100,000 DTE check arrived today.”

In 2022, DTE's Ternes told the Guardian: “DTE has worked hand-in-hand with the governor to protect our customers, employees and the public throughout the coronavirus pandemic. The actions taken by the state have slowed Covid transmission and death rates.”

The utility industry widely uses dark money to influence policy across the country, and the donations have been at the center of recent scandals, including two in neighboring Ohio. MEF also donates millions each election cycle to a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including to Whitmer's affiliated Pac.

The donations show DTE “has power and wields influence over parts of people's lives that they don't want DTE to have influence over”, said Eli Day, communications director for the We the People Action Fund, which has been involved in utility affordability campaigns.

Donations like this are made through dark money channels because companies know their political donations would generate blowback, Day added.

“Ordinary people who are outraged can have a real impact and change their lives for the better, and DTE is terrified of that,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:taipeitimes.com","Taiwan Ratings raises GDP growth forecast to 3.3%","https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2025/07/08/2003839902","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

Taiwan Ratings Corp (中華信評) has upgraded its GDP growth forecast for Taiwan this year to 3.3 percent from its 2.4 percent estimate in March, citing robust first-half momentum fueled by a resilient technology sector and front-loaded export orders.

Despite the upward revision, the ratings agency yesterday cautioned that the economy would face mounting headwinds in the second half.

Taiwan's economy remains vulnerable to external shocks due to its trade-dependent structure and exposure to global supply chains, Taiwan Ratings credit analyst Joe Lin (林顯勍) said at a news conference in Taipei.

“Export strength seen in the first half is likely to taper off as clients complete inventory restocking and early shipments intended to get ahead of anticipated US tariff hikes begin to fade,” Lin said.

The New Taiwan dollar's sharp appreciation could also erode local exporters' profit margins and reduce their competitiveness across tech supply chains, Lin added.

The local currency's exchange rate against the US dollar is projected to stabilize at about NT$30 this year, as tariff-related volatility subsides, he said.

Washington is expected to announce further tariff details this week, as a 90-day waiver ends, a development that could influence Taiwan's export performance.

Outside the technology sector, performance across traditional industries is mixed. 

Taiwan Ratings credit analyst Beatrice Chen (陳靜儀) said the chemicals industry remains under pressure, with recovery lagging earlier forecasts.

China's stimulus efforts are unlikely to provide meaningful relief, given underlying structural demand weaknesses, she added.

Steelmakers are also under strain, as subdued global demand, persistent overcapacity in China and rising exports weigh on prices and profitability of Taiwanese peers, Chen said.

In contrast, the cement industry is showing signs of stabilization. Improved pricing and production discipline in China, and lower coal costs are helping shore up margins, she said.

Steady income from non-cement operations and overseas businesses is also supporting cash flow stability, she added.

As for financial services, insurers are facing challenges amid market volatility. 

Taiwan Ratings credit analyst Andy Chang (張書評) said that average returns on assets are expected to decline this year. 

However, enhanced hedging strategies and regulatory support are likely to preserve the sector's profitability, he said.

Life insurance premium growth is projected to be about 6 percent this year, driven by demand for US dollar-denominated, interest-sensitive and participating policies, Chang said.


INVESTOR RESILIENCE?
                                        An analyst said that despite near-term pressures, foreign investors tend to view NT dollar strength as a positive signal for valuation multiples                                        Morgan Stanley has flagged a potential 10 percent revenue decline for Taiwan's tech hardware sector this year, as a sharp appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar begins to dent the earnings power of major exporters.
In what appears to be the first such warning from a major foreign brokerage, the US investment bank said the currency's strength — fueled by foreign capital inflows and expectations of US interest rate cuts — is compressing profit margins for manufacturers with heavy exposure to US dollar-denominated revenues.
The local currency has surged about 10 percent against the greenback over the past quarter and yesterday breached                                    


MARKET FACTORS:
                                        Navitas Semiconductor Inc said that Powerchip is to take over from TSMC as its supplier of high-voltage gallium nitride chips                                        Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, 台積電) yesterday in a statement said that it would phase out its compound semiconductor gallium nitride (GaN) business over the next two years, citing market dynamics.
The decision would not affect its financial targets announced previously, the world's biggest contract chipmaker said.
“We are working closely with our customers to ensure a smooth transition and remain committed to meeting their needs during this period,” it said. “Our focus continues to be on delivering sustained value to our partners and the market.”
TSMC's latest move came unexpectedly, as the chipmaker had said in its annual report that it has                                    



                                                                                Rick Cassidy, the chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's (TSMC, 台積電) US subsidiary, TSMC Arizona Corp, plans to retire, but the company has yet to name a successor.
After Cassidy made his intention to retire known, TSMC Arizona held a special general meeting and approved a resolution that Cassidy would not continue as chairman and would not remain as a director, TSMC said in a statement filed with the Taiwan Stock Exchange last night.
The meeting also approved a plan to appoint TSMC Arizona president Rose Castanares as a director, the company said, adding that Cassidy has been named as an advisor                                    


SECURITY WARNING:
                                        The company possesses key 3-nanometer technology, and Taiwan should prevent it from being transferred to China, a lawmaker said                                        The Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday said it would conduct a “strict review” of any proposed acquisition of Taiwanese tech company Source Photonics Co (索爾思光電), following media reports that a Chinese firm was planning to buy the company in the Hsinchu Science Park (新竹科學園區).
Local media reported that Suzhou Dongshan Precision Manufacturing Co (東山精密), China's largest printed circuit board manufacturer, had announced plans to acquire Source Photonics for 5.9 billion yuan (US$823.1 million).
The ministry said it has not received an application from Source Photonics and has formally notified the company that any buyout would constitute a change in its ownership structure.

Paris couture week opened not with sequins or red carpet pageantry, but Cardi B's crow moment.

Wrapped in a custom Schiaparelli gown of graphic fringe, the U.S. rapper stood beneath the gilded columns of the Petit Palais, holding a live crow on her arm.

Her avian plus one squawked, glared, and nearly lunged – setting the tone for a show that soared straight into the surreal.

It was a fitting image for Schiaparelli. Elsa Schiaparelli, the house's founder, built her legend in the 1930s by weaving the unexpected – lobster dresses, shoe hats, and, yes, animals – into the heart of high fashion.

That legacy pulsed through Daniel Roseberry's Fall 2025 collection, a spectacle in pure black and white, staged as if the city itself had been drained of color, leaving only stark contrast and raw emotion.

Cardi B accessorized with a crow, while Dua Lipa and Karol G were also among the stars arriving to see Schiaparelli's show at Paris Fashion Week.

The Associated Press

Inside, the mood was cinematic – gowns and jackets defined by intensity and ease, with the waist and hips shaped through unexpected techniques. Hints of disco sheen flickered like film across the runway.

But if the house has been criticized in the past for relying on extreme corsetry and body manipulation, this season marked a shift. Roseberry, perhaps heeding the critics, abandoned his signature corset silhouette. In its place: a freer, more elastic exploration of the body, echoing Schiaparelli's own restless spirit.

Roseberry said the collection was inspired by the moment in 1940, when Elsa Schiaparelli fled Nazi-occupied Paris for New York – a period “when life and art was on the precipice: to the sunset of elegance, and to the end of the world as we knew it.”

Here, that tension was alive in every look: archival codes reimagined, but with a restless push toward the future. Dresses undulated like car bodies, hips arced in impossibly engineered shapes, ribbons from antique Lyon couture fluttered as kinetic sculptures.

Yet the show was more than spectacle. This was couture at its most essential – an ideas factory for the entire fashion industry, unfettered by trends.

“Chanel was interested in how clothes could be of practical use to women; Elsa was interested in what fashion could be,” Roseberry added.

It is this what-if energy, the transformation of memory, myth, and sheer technique into something never seen before, that keeps couture vital, even as the world rushes toward AI and disposable fast fashion.

The setting only heightened the effect. The Petit Palais is currently home to an exhibit on Charles Worth, the 19th-century Englishman who invented haute couture by bringing artistry and handcraft to Paris. The symmetry was irresistible: in these halls, Schiaparelli's past collided with fashion's future, reminding all why couture matters: not as museum piece, but as living laboratory for risk, reinvention, and radical beauty.

A decade after its relaunch, Schiaparelli has found commercial traction and become a fixture on the world's red carpets, a rare feat in today's luxury market. But above all, the brand's power lies in its ability to surprise. On opening day, as Cardi B's crow threatened to take flight, Schiaparelli proved that in Paris, fashion's most potent magic is still the unexpected.

If there is one executive who represents the agony and the ecstasy of car company ownership, it is John Elkann. 

Mr. Elkann, 49, is the heir of Italy's Agnelli family dynasty and the chairman of both Stellantis STLA-N, the world's fourth-biggest auto maker, and Ferrari RACE-N. The family holding company that he runs, Exor, is the biggest single shareholder in both companies. His grandfather, Gianni Agnelli, who died in 2003, was the Italian industrialist and playboy fashion dandy who controlled Fiat and turned it, briefly, into Europe's biggest auto maker. 

Two weeks ago at the Ferrari factory in northern Italy, Mr. Elkann made a rare public appearance. On stage, he was wearing white pants, blue sneakers and a blue Ferrari jersey, as if he were about to step onto a yacht. In fact, he was launching Ferrari's latest project, Hypersail, a sailboat that will be 30 metres long, cost a fortune – the price was not disclosed – and no doubt burn up the long-distance ocean racing circuit in the same way Ferrari machines burn up the F1 circuits. 

“We're taking Ferrari from the land to the sea,” Mr. Elkann said.

For investors and hard-core F1 fans, Hypersail was a non-event. So far, only one boat is planned and its development costs will be paltry compared to the hundreds of millions Ferrari spends every year on research and development for its sports and F1 cars. But that's not the point; the point is that Ferrari is at the top of its game and can afford to blow a few bucks on adventures in the name of brand extension – or just for the hell of it.

While everything about Ferrari makes Mr. Elkann beam with pride, the same cannot be said about Stellantis, whose brands include Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Maserati, Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge, Citroen and Peugeot. 

Stellantis, especially its once-glorious Italian brands and its once-steadfast U.S. fleet, are losing horrendous amounts of market share. In 2024, global revenues fell 17 per cent to €157-billion, net profits sank 70 per cent to €5.5-billion and auto deliveries were down 12 per cent. In the U.S., the company's market share is a mere 8 per cent; not long ago, it was more than 12 per cent. 

Opinion: With a brand new CEO, Stellantis sets itself up for failure once again

Ferrari makes about 14,000 cars a year, Stellantis about six million. Ferrari shares have climbed 6 per cent in the last 12 months, giving the company a value of €80-billion. Stellantis shares have lost 52 per cent, for a value of €25.3-billion. 

Here's another way of looking at it. Each car that comes off the Ferrari line (excluding the F1s) is equivalent to €5.7-million of market value. For Stellantis, the figure is €4,200. 

It's hard to imagine that Mr. Elkann would sell Ferrari or merge it with another sports car maker. It's entirely possible to imagine that he would unload Stellantis. But that scenario today seems highly unlikely, given that the company has lost almost two-thirds of his value since 2024. He and the new Stellantis CEO, Italy's Antonio Filosa, who replaced the hapless Carlos Tavares of Portugal, will have to overhaul the company before they wade into the sellers' market. But how?

Stellantis was formed in 2021 by the merger of Fiat Chrysler with France's PSA Group. Fiat Chrysler had been put together by Sergio Marchionne, the Italian-Canadian CEO who saved both the Italian and American car makers from oblivion, and who was also CEO of Ferrari. He died in 2018, after which the Agnelli-Elkann family sought a merger partner for the mass-market auto maker. Stellantis was created and Mr. Tavares hit the ground running. 

Huge profits were reported at first, but sales fell off a cliff in 2023 and 2024 as the company jacked up prices, repelling customers, while it was trying to cope with pandemic-induced supply shortages.

Stellantis was its own worst enemy in other ways.

It arrived late to the electric-vehicle scene and its cars became bland. Alfa Romeo, for instance, became largely a maker of SUVs, betraying its lineage of sleek, light, sexy sports cars. 

Excessive platform-sharing diluted brand values. The Alfa Romeo Tonale compact SUV, for instance, is based on a platform shared with Jeeps. Maserati was allowed to languish and now barely exists. Ditto Lancia and Abarth, Fiat's maker of hot little cars. Chrysler, Dodge and Fiat itself pumped out a series of forgettable machines. Sales plummeted. Stellantis's Mirafiori factory in Turin, which was Europe's biggest car factory in the pre-Marchionne Fiat era, has almost no production. 

The bigger problem is fighting the rise of Chinese EVs. China has built battery and EV plants in Hungary to infiltrate the EU market and avoid tariffs. Another problem is the EU plan to end the sale of internal-combustion-engine cars by 2035. No auto company, let alone Stellantis, is prepared for that deadline. Factories will inevitably close, handing greater market share to cheap Chinese EVs. 

Ferrari will almost certainly survive and thrive (as a low-volume manufacturer, it hopes to be exempt from the 2035 deadline). But Stellantis, who knows? It has too many brands, too little respect for the qualities that had made some of the brands, like Alfa and Maserati, wonders on wheels, and a broken EV strategy. In Maranello last month, Mr. Elkann was happy to talk about Ferrari but declined to answer questions about Stellantis. No wonder.

Several National Weather Service offices in Texas are considerably understaffed.

Over the weekend, President Donald Trump appeared to deflect reporters' questions on the deadly flash floods in central Texas last week, including a question on whether his administration's cuts to the National Weather Service (NWS) affected preparedness levels in the region.

As of Monday morning, more than 80 deaths across six Texas counties have been documented, while dozens reportedly remain missing. In Kerr County alone, 40 adults and 28 children have been killed by the catastrophic flooding, including 27 campers and counselors at a popular youth campsite.

On Sunday, while taking questions from reporters, Trump claimed that he had difficulty hearing a reporter who had started asking a question about cuts to the NWS.

“Democrats are blaming your federal cuts for the deaths over in Texas,” the reporter began her question to Trump, shouting loud enough to be heard.

Despite the reporter's volume — and the fact that he was able to understand other reporters' questions beforehand — Trump responded by saying, “I can't hear you.” He then waved off the reporter, shifting his attention to another journalist at the presser. 

Q: “Dems are blaming your cuts for the deaths in Texas.” (It isn't just Dems)Trump: *pretends he can't hear*Q: “Are you still planning to phase out FEMA?”Trump: “We can talk about that later.”

Later, another reporter asked about cuts to the NWS, questioning whether the Trump administration's actions hampered warnings to people in central Texas affected by the floodings.

“They didn't,” Trump said matter-of-factly.

The president also appeared to place some blame on his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, though he walked back that blame just seconds later.

“You look at that water situation, that was really the Biden setup,” Trump said. “That was not our setup. But I wouldn't blame Biden for it either; I would just say this is a hundred-year catastrophe, and it's just so horrible to watch.”

Trump has similarly blamed Democratic leaders for water systems detrimentally contributing to natural disasters in the past, citing no evidence.

Trump also pushed back on the idea that the federal government should rehire meteorologists that his “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) has terminated or pushed out.

“I wouldn't know that. I really wouldn't. I would think not,” he said, further claiming that “nobody expected” the flooding to happen. 

In fact, despite its limited resources, the NWS issued warnings about the Texas floods hours before they occurred.

Some experts have suggested that staffing shortages at the agency prompted by DOGE's cuts hindered forecasters' abilities to effectively warn people in the region, as several NWS sites in Texas lack key personnel.

In San Angelo, Texas, for instance, the NWS office does not have a senior hydrologist, a staff forecaster, or even a top meteorologist. In San Antonio, the NWS office lacks a warning coordination meteorologist and a science officer. 

Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) has said that it's worth examining whether cuts to the NWS worsened the devastating floods.

“I don't think it's helpful to have missing key personnel from the [NWS] not in place to help prevent these tragedies,” Castro said in an interview on CNN, adding that the situation “should be investigated.”

“The library is for everybody,” said the Pierce County library manager, who had served for 15 years before her firing.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

A 15-year employee of a library in southern Georgia was fired from her position last month over her inclusion of a book featuring a transgender child in a display.

The display created by Pierce County Library Manager Lavonnia Moore was part of a statewide “color our world” summer reading program. Moore said that children contributed to the display, which featured media of varying colors.

“There were books, DVDs, games, and each and every one of them had at least a hint of a rainbow on it,” she said, speaking to The Georgia Recorder about her termination last week. “Because all the kids went to find rainbows. I was just happy that the kids knew where the books were. They even took the time to go into the card catalog to find books.”

One child asked Moore if she could include a book called “When Aidan Became a Brother,” by Kyle Lukoff, in the display. Moore said she was unfamiliar with the book, which features a transgender boy whose family is about to welcome another child.

“All I saw was Aidan becoming a big brother,” Moore said. “I saw a family with a kid wearing a rainbow sweater and the mom pregnant. It was a mixed family. I was like, ‘OK, sure, put it on the table.'”

The book's inclusion in the display caught the attention of a far right religious organization called the Alliance for Faith and Family, which waged a social media campaign against Moore, calling on its followers to email the Three Rivers Library System and Pierce County elected officials demanding action against her. The group claimed the book was part of a “mental manipulation” to teach children “God made them incorrectly,” Georgia Public Broadcasting reported.

On June 18, Moore met with Three Rivers Library System Director Jeremy Snell, who told her he was firing her over the controversy.

Moore said she was “shocked” at the news of her termination.

“I broke down. In my mind, I was thinking to myself, ‘I was not going to tell a child no,'” she said.

“This was not about poor performance. It was about political pressure,” she told Georgia Public Broadcasting.

That the book included LGBTQ themes shouldn't matter, she told other news outlets, noting:

The library is for everybody. You should be able to go into any library and feel welcome or at least find something that you will enjoy reading, doing or any resources.

Moore has started a GoFundMe page to help cover her living expenses and to mount a legal challenge to her termination. She has criticized the library system for firing her without hearing her side of the story.

“Instead of investigating, talking to me or my team, or exploring any kind of fair process, they used the ‘at-will' clause in my contract to terminate me on the spot,” Moore wrote on her GoFundMe page. “No warning. No meeting. No due diligence. Just the words ‘poor decision making' on a piece of paper after 15 years of service.”

The author of the book that led to Moore's firing, Kyle Lukoff, has shared multiple links to news articles about her on his Bluesky account. He has also expressed his direct support for Moore, describing the library system's actions as deeply unjust.

“Lavonnia Moore, the librarian fired for including one of my books on a display after a child requested it, sounds incredible,” Lukoff wrote in a post, “and what happened to her should be a crime.”

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) — A woman was killed when floodwaters from the remnants of Tropical Storm Chantal swept her car from a rural road and forced dozens of people to flee their homes, officials in North Carolina said Monday. 

Parts of central North Carolina experienced hazardous conditions overnight including 3 to 8 inches (about 8 to 20 centimeters) of rain and possible tornadoes, according to North Carolina Emergency Management. Multiple swift water rescues were conducted in Alamance, Orange, Chatham and Durham counties overnight and several areas have declared local states of emergency, officials said. About 120 roads were closed Monday across the state, but several major roads had reopened, including parts of Interstate 40 and 85 in Alamance County, according to Gov. Josh Stein's office. 

An 83-year-old Pittsboro woman was killed when her car was swept off a rural Chatham County road by floodwaters on Sunday night, according to the North Carolina State Highway Patrol. Responding troopers found the submerged vehicle about 100 feet (about 31 meters) from the road and the woman was found dead inside, officials said. 

The Chapel Hill Fire Department and neighboring agencies completed more than 50 water rescues, many of them in areas where floodwaters entered or threatened to enter apartments, officials said. More than 60 people were displaced Sunday and Monday. After helping with rescues in Chapel Hill, the Durham Fire Department said in a social media post that its crews performed more than 80 more rescues in the Old Farm area of Durham. 

Alesia Ray, 65, stood on a second-floor staircase at her apartment building in Chapel Hill for five hours, clicking a flashlight, until rescuers in a rubber boat got her out. Below her, floodwaters wrecked her home.




“It was really scary,” she said Monday as she and fiancé Thomas Hux worked to salvage some of their belongings. “I've never experienced anything like that. I don't want to go through that again.”

Floodwaters inundated Chapel Hill's Eastgate Crossings shopping center, where the red-framed glass doors of a Talbots store were blown in and debris-specked white mannequins littered the floor. Next door, at the Great Outdoor Provision Co., manager Chad Pickens said kayaks ended up 30 feet from where they had been on display and shelves in the shoe room were toppled like dominoes. 

What happened there pales in comparison to the floods in Texas, he said.

“The bottom line is these are just things, and while it hurts to lose things, it's a lot different to losing people,” Pickens said.

A large brown dumpster had smashed into the outdoor dining area of a Shake Shack in the shopping center. The windows were blown out and chairs and cups were strewn everywhere.

Hua Jiang said he put in an order at the Shake Shack around 8:45 p.m. Sunday and about 10 minutes later, water started flowing through the doors. After about five minutes, employees said they should make a run for it, he said. Jiang's Toyota RAV4 was already flooded in the parking lot, so he went to a Chipotle that was on higher ground.

“It's unfortunate, but that's life,” Jiang said, wiping sweat from his brow on Monday morning.

A facility used to service local government vehicles in Carrboro, a town near Chapel Hill, was also significantly damaged as rushing floodwaters rose more than 3 feet (about 1 meter), the town's public works director, Kevin Belanger, said at a news conference Monday. Several solid waste trucks and police cars were totaled from the storm, he said. 

In Chatham County, authorities were searching Monday for two canoers who went missing during the storm, according to a county sheriff's office news release. They were last seen launching their canoe on Jordan Lake late Sunday afternoon and their canoe was recovered Sunday night, authorities said.

The Eno River crested early Monday at Durham at 25.63 feet (7.81 meters), surpassing the previous record of 23.6 feet (7.19 meters), according to the National Water Prediction Service's website.

The Haw River crested early Monday at 32.5 feet (9.91 meters), the second highest river stage ever recorded at the Town of Haw River. That level was only eclipsed by Hurricane Fran in 1996 when the stage reached 32.83 feet (10.01 meters), according to a post from the National Weather Service's Raleigh office.

Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a depression Sunday after making landfall near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, early Sunday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. 

By late morning Monday, the storm was about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north-northeast of Newport News, Virginia, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (45 kph). It was moving northeast at about 17 mph (28 kph).

Flood watches were in effect for parts of eastern Virginia, southern and eastern Maryland, Delaware, southern New Jersey and southeastern Pennsylvania. Forecasters warned of dangerous surf and rip currents at beaches from northeastern Florida to the mid-Atlantic states for the next couple of days.

Coconino County Sheriff's Office rescue teams made a dramatic rescue after a woman who went on a hike with her father went missing for three days.

A tourist who went missing after she failed to return to her cruise ship last week has been found dead.

Marites Buenafe, 62, of Kentucky, was visiting Alaska's capital city when she did not return from a hike.

The Alaska Department of Public Safety said her body was found by an Alaska Army National Guard helicopter crew late Thursday below the ridge line of Gold Ridge.

Buenafe is listed as a doctor at UK HealthCare, a system of hospitals and clinics of the University of Kentucky.

State troopers and Juneau Mountain Rescue were able to recover Buenafe's body with help from Temsco Helicopters and the National Guard.

Her family has been notified of her death and her body will be sent to the state's medical examiner's office for an autopsy, the Associated Press reported.

On July 1, the Juneau Police Department heard from Buenafe's relatives that she had left for a hike that morning and had plans to take a popular tourist tram partially up a mountain overlooking downtown Juneau before walking to Gastineau Peak and Gold Ridge, according to the state Department of Public Safety. 

She had gotten off the Norwegian Bliss and did not return to the vessel by its departure time.

Fox News correspondent David Spunt has the latest on Kilmar Abrego Garcia's trial on 'Special Report.'

Justice Department lawyers and attorneys for Salvadoran migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia will square off in court Monday as a federal judge in Maryland weighs a flurry of motions over his U.S. custody – and the Trump administration pushes to dismiss the civil case entirely – in a closely watched legal battle that's become a flashpoint in President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. 

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis scheduled the hearing last week to consider recent motions from both sides, after Abrego Garcia was wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March and returned three months later to face criminal charges in a different state.

The hearing is all but certain to reignite a high-profile fight over Abrego Garcia's legal status in the U.S., which is currently playing out in two separate federal courts.

Ahead of the 11 a.m. hearing, here's what to know about the civil case – and potential next steps from Judge Xinis.

FEDERAL JUDGE JAMES BOASBERG FINDS PROBABLE CAUSE TO HOLD TRUMP IN CONTEMPT OVER DEPORTATION FLIGHTS

The hearing in Maryland comes after Salvadorian migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia was summarily deported by Trump officials to El Salvador in March in violation of an existing court order. His family sued the Trump administration over his removal almost immediately, and later that month, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, an Obama appointee, ordered the Trump administration to ""facilitate"" Abrego Garica's return to the U.S. 

The ruling was later upheld by the Supreme Court, though it took three months – and many discovery hearings before Xinis – for Trump officials to eventually comply with the court's order and return him to the U.S. in June.

On return, Abrego Garcia was immediately taken into custody in Tennessee for federal charges stemming from a 2022 traffic stop. Court documents show the charges were brought in late May, prompting questions as to when the investigation, and the impaneling of a grand jury, would have taken place.

It's unclear how far Xinis will go in addressing the competing requests filed by both sides, though she signaled last week that the hearing will remain narrowly focused on the government's motion to dismiss the civil case and the plaintiffs' bid to transfer Abrego Garcia into U.S. custody in Maryland.

Abrego Garcia's lawyers had asked Xinis to issue an order blocking his possible removal from the U.S. without prior notification, pointing to statements from the Trump administration as evidence that they could try to remove him to a possible third country other than El Salvador. 

""Defendants have repeatedly stated their intent to remove Mr. Abrego Garcia to a third country,"" his lawyers said last week in a filing, adding that he could face ""persecution or torture if removed directly to various other countries,"" including Libya, South Sudan and Eritrea, which are notorious for human rights abuses. 

Meanwhile, new allegations made in court filings days earlier could prove difficult for the court to distinguish in its consideration of the other issues.

Last week, Abrego Garcia alleged in a filing that he was severely beaten and psychologically tortured in El Salvador's maximum-security prison, CECOT, when he was detained there earlier this year.

Adding to the complexity of the matter is the separate criminal case playing out in Tennessee. 

The federal judge overseeing that case on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to comply with rules prohibiting Justice Department and DHS officials from making any public statements about Abrego Garcia that could potentially prejudice a jury or impact the integrity of the court proceedings, after his attorneys accused administration officials of months of ""extensive and inflammatory extrajudicial comments"" against their client that threatened to prejudice his right to a fair trial.

""Thus far, the government's unabated public disparagement of [Abrego] has far outpaced its ability to muster actual evidence, notwithstanding its extraordinary efforts to conjure up such evidence,"" they wrote, warning that such statements could complicate efforts to seat an impartial jury in the Middle District of Tennessee, where his trial is set to take place.

It remains to be seen what Xinis will do in Abrego Garcia's civil case, especially as the criminal case in Tennessee proceeds. 

But her frustration with the Trump administration has been clear in earlier proceedings. For months, Xinis struggled to obtain answers from Trump administration officials on Abrego Garcia's status in El Salvador, as well as what, if any, efforts the Trump government had taken to comply with her order to facilitate his return to the U.S., and at one time suggested she could move to open possible contempt proceedings against the administration.

In May, Xinis sparred with the Justice Department lawyers for more than two hours over their lack of candor and compliance with the discovery process and the deadlines set by the court. It was the last public status hearing she presided over before the administration returned Abrego Garcia to U.S. soil.

During that hearing, Judge Xinis rebuked the Justice Department for attempting to invoke the state secrets privilege via a footnote that referenced a filing in a separate federal court case, before a different federal judge. 

She also excoriated the lack of compliance from Trump administration officials, and attempts to press the administration for answers, which she described as beating a ""frustrated and dead horse.""

President Joe Biden was implored by his closest advisers to participate in his ill-fated debate against now-President Donald Trump, which ended his campaign and precipitated former Vice President Kamala Harris replacing him as the 2024 Democratic nominee.

In a six-page memo, dated April 15, Biden's advisers underscored how the then-president should debate Trump “as early as possible” because the Commission on Presidential Debates schedule would have started on Sept. 16 when many battleground states had already commenced early voting and voter registration deadlines would have passed.

“By holding the first debate in the spring, YOU will be able to reach the widest audience possible before we are deep in the summer months with the conventions, Olympics, and family vacations taking precedence,” Biden's advisers wrote. “In addition, the earlier YOU are able to debate the better, so that the American people can see YOU standing next to Trump and showing the strength of YOUR leadership, compared to Trump's weakness and chaos.”

The advisers also suggested that Biden debate Trump twice during his campaign and agree to a plan with his opponent as quickly as possible so he could “enter the debate process from a position of strength.”

The memo, poised to be published in Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager, and Isaac Arnsdorf's upcoming book 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America, additionally detailed advice regarding debate preparation in “three parts.”

The three parts included “practice at different opportunities with ongoing press and radio engagements, question and answer sessions as part of appropriate and pre-planned campaign engagements, and more formal activities, like a campaign taped town hall.”

“Intensive prep in the lead up to the debate, similar to what was done around [State of the Union]-prep — we would build out debate prep at Camp David for at least a five-day stretch leading up to YOUR debate appearances,” Biden's advisers wrote.

Instead, Biden's June 27 debate against Trump punctuated the public perception the former president was too old to remain commander in chief, walking stiffly onto the CNN set, coughing twice during his first answer, and then losing his train of thought within the first 15 minutes in response to a question about the care economy and drug prices. He, too, was captured looking at Trump with his mouth agape. His performance contributed to his eventual decision to step down from running and paved the way for Harris's 100-day campaign, in which she eventually lost to Trump.

‘YOUR CAMPAIGN IS A MESS': WHAT ‘INCREDULOUS' OBAMA THOUGHT OF BIDEN RUNNING AGAIN

Despite the memo, Dawsey, Pager, and Arnsdorf simultaneously report that the advice that Biden should debate Trump as early as possible was not unanimous. One donor reportedly told Biden's advisers to “find an excuse” for the former president not to debate after a concerning appearance during a Chicago fundraiser, the trio writes in an excerpt published by Politico on Monday.

2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America comes after the Wall Street Journal reported last weekend that Hunter Biden asserted his presence in his father's White House, attempting to pressure the Democratic National Committee into paying his legal fees amid federal prosecutions for tax and gun crimes, participating in administration phone calls, and encouraging his father to pardon him as he did before the end of his one and only term.

The book similarly comes as House Republicans ramp up their investigations into the Biden White House, particularly the former president and his advisers' use of his autopen during his administration.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Crew members aboard a Liberian-flagged ship set ablaze by a series of attacks in the Red Sea abandoned the vessel Sunday night as it took on water, marking the first serious assault in the vital corridor for trade after a monthslong campaign by Yemen‘s Houthi rebels there.

Suspicion for the attack on the Greek-owned bulk carrier Magic Seas immediately fell on the Houthis, particularly as a security firm said it appeared bomb-carrying drone boats hit the ship after it was targeted by small arms and rocket-propelled grenades. The rebels' media reported on the attack but did not claim it. It can take them hours or even days before they acknowledge an assault.

A renewed Houthi campaign against shipping could again draw in U.S. and Western forces to the area, particularly after President Donald Trump targeted the rebels in a major airstrike campaign.

Shortly before midnight in Yemen, Israel's military issued a warning for three Houthi-held ports and said airstrikes would begin shortly in Hodeidah, Ras Isa, and Salif, along with at the Ras al-Khatib power station.

The ship attack comes at a sensitive moment in the Middle East, as a possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war hangs in the balance and as Iran weighs whether to restart negotiations over its nuclear program following American airstrikes targeting its most sensitive atomic sites amid an Israeli war against the Islamic Republic.

“It likely serves as a message that the Houthis continue to possess the capability and willingness to strike at strategic maritime targets regardless of diplomatic developments,” wrote Mohammad al Basha, a Yemen analyst at the Basha Report risk advisory firm.

The British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center first said that an armed security team on the unidentified vessel had returned fire against an initial attack and that the “situation is ongoing.” It described the attack as happening some 60 miles southwest of Hodeida, Yemen, which is held by the country's Houthi rebels.

“Authorities are investigating,” it said. It later said the ship was on fire after being “struck by unknown projectiles.”

Ambrey, a private maritime security firm, issued an alert saying that a merchant ship had been “attacked by eight skiffs while transiting northbound in the Red Sea.”

Ambrey later said the ship also had been attacked by bomb-carrying drone boats, which could mark a major escalation. It said two drone boats struck the ship, while another two had been destroyed by the armed guards on board.

The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said the ship was taking on water and its crew had abandoned the vessel.

The U.S. Navy‘s Mideast-based 5th Fleet referred questions to the military's Central Command, which said it was aware of the incident without elaborating.

Moammar al Eryani, the information minister for Yemen's exiled government opposing the Houthis, identified the vessel attacked as the Magic Seas and blamed the rebels for the attack. The ship had been broadcasting it had an armed security team on board in the vicinity the attack took place and had been heading north.

“The attack also proves once again that the Houthis are merely a front for an Iranian scheme using Yemen as a platform to undermine regional and global stability, at a time when Tehran continues to arm the militia and provide it with military technology, including missiles, aircraft, drones, and sea mines,” al Eryani wrote on the social platform X.

The Magic Seas' owners did not respond to a request for comment.

The Houthi rebels have been launching missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group's leadership has described as an effort to end Israel's offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

The group's al Masirah satellite news channel acknowledged the attack occurred, but offered no other comment on it as it aired a speech by its secretive leader, Abdul Malik al Houthi. However, Ambrey said the vessel targeted met “the established Houthi target profile,” without elaborating.

Between November 2023 and January 2025, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.

The Houthis paused attacks in a self-imposed ceasefire until the United States launched a broad assault against the rebels in mid-March. That ended weeks later and the Houthis haven't attacked a vessel, though they have continued occasional missile attacks targeting Israel. On Sunday, the group claimed launching a missile at Israel, which the Israeli military said it intercepted. Shipping through the Red Sea, while still lower than normal, has increased in recent weeks.

Meanwhile, a wider, decadelong war in Yemen between the Houthis and the country's exiled government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, remains in a stalemate. The Yemeni Coast Guard, which is loyal to the exiled government, has engaged in a firefight with at least one vessel in the Red Sea in the past as well.

Pirates from Somalia also have operated in the region, though typically they've sought to capture vessels either to rob or ransom their crews. But neither the Yemeni Coast Guard nor the pirates have been known to use drone boats in their attacks.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Why the Medicaid work requirement is a terrible idea

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

According to the White House, the One Big Beautiful Bill, the president's signature second-term domestic legislation, does not cut Medicaid. According to any number of budget analysts, including Congress's own, it guts the health program, bleeding it of $1 trillion in financing and eliminating coverage for 10 million people.

The White House has found a simple way to square this technocratic circle: lie. A trillion dollars in cuts is not a cut; stripping 10 million people of health insurance does not constitute shrinking the program; the president never said “lock her up”; Joe Biden did not win the 2020 election; up is down and down is up.

Other Republicans are adopting a more complicated form of explanatory geometry. The law implements a nationwide work requirement for Medicaid. Able-bodied adults will have to prove that they are employed, volunteering, or in school in exchange for coverage. “If you are able to work and you refuse to do so, you are defrauding the system,” Speaker Mike Johnson explained on CBS. “You're cheating the system, and no one in the country believes that that's right. So there's a moral component to what we're doing.” The law does not cut Medicaid, in this telling. It protects the program from abuse.

Johnson's explanation is no less galling than Donald Trump's lies. The Medicaid work requirement will not strengthen the program, improve the labor market, or kick lazy cheaters off government benefits. Rather, it will saddle taxpayers with billions of dollars of new costs and low-income Americans with hundreds of millions of hours of busywork. Red tape will cause millions of people to lose health coverage, some of whom will perish because they cannot access care. Republicans are not protecting Medicaid. They are voting to annoy their own constituents to death.

Why does Medicaid need a work requirement in the first place? To prevent the safety net from becoming a hammock, Republicans love to say. But most people on Medicaid are already working if they can work. And Medicaid doesn't provide its enrollees with cash or a cash-like payment, as the country's unemployment-insurance, welfare, Social Security, and SNAP programs do. You can't eat an insurance card. You can't pay your rent with the guarantee of low co-pays for ambulatory care. Because insurance does not help recipients make ends meet, it does not shrink the labor market, as proved by a randomized controlled trial.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 64 percent of nondisabled adults on Medicaid have a job. Most of the others are not working because they have medical problems or significant caretaking responsibilities, or because they are attending school. Just 8 percent of nondisabled adults seem to be in the category of folks Johnson hopes will be spurred to work by the threat of losing their health coverage. They aren't 28-year-old guys signing up for public insurance so they can play video games all day. They are retirees and people who can't find work in their community.

Thus, the work requirement should really be understood as a work-reporting requirement. Starting in 2027, nondisabled adults will have to log in and tell Uncle Sam what they do with their time in order to afford cancer screenings and bloodwork. Each state with an expanded Medicaid program will have to pay a contractor to create, test, and launch a complex intake-and-verification system in 18 months—six, really, because the Department of Health and Human Services is not expected to release detailed rules on the new requirement until midway through next year. In 2019, the Government Accountability Office found that states had spent as much as $463 per beneficiary setting up such systems in the past. Georgia, the only state that currently has a Medicaid work requirement, spends $9 on overhead for every $1 it spends on medical care through the initiative.

More than 20 million Americans will have to set up accounts to let the state know that they are in compliance with the work requirement, out of compliance, or not subject to it. This likely means collecting documents, uploading them, waiting for verifications, submitting sensitive personal data, and appealing incorrect determinations, all on what, history shows, will surely be a clunky, faulty system backed by a too-small cadre of overworked and underpaid civil servants. A broken laptop or a faulty internet connection might cause an individual to get rejected; a missed phone call from a caseworker might lead to a person missing out on care. Washington is shifting the burden of public administration onto individuals, and counting on people to fail.

In general, work requirements are far better at weeding out worthy participants than they are at motivating noncompliant ones. Roughly 240,000 Georgians are eligible for the state's work-for-Medicaid initiative, which covers very poor nondisabled adults. Only 5,500 are actually enrolled, thanks to the complexity of the program's rules and the impossibility of its portal. Arkansas kicked nearly 20,000 people off Medicaid when it required applicants to prove that they were working in 2018 and 2019; the change had no effect on employment. One analysis of the One Big Beautiful Bill suggests that each “appropriate” disenrollment from Medicaid will cost taxpayers $5,000 in bureaucratic overhead—not far off from how much Medicaid spends per person to begin with.

Trump's law doesn't protect Medicaid. It requires Americans to spend hundreds of millions of hours a year filling out tedious, unnecessary paperwork. It will cause millions of Americans to lose their health coverage, limiting their access to care and forcing them into debt. An estimated 50,000 people will die each year—many thanks to red tape.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The former California governor is the latest to recognize that the most remarkable thing about the first president was not how he exercised power, but how he yielded it.

On July 4, Arnold Schwarzenegger made his first pilgrimage to Mount Vernon. The former California governor was there to congratulate 100 individuals from nearly as many countries, ranging from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, as they became American citizens. In doing so, he joined a long line of distinguished individuals who have come to pay homage to a man whose leadership was defined not by how he wielded power, but by how he gave it up.

That ideal of voluntary restraint inspired a much earlier visitor, the Marquis de Lafayette. In 1784, less than a year after the end of the Revolutionary War, Lafayette journeyed from France to the banks of the Potomac River in Virginia, and from there to Mount Vernon. The nobleman and Continental Army general was the first foreigner to visit George Washington after he gave up power. Writing to his wife, the marquis declared, “In retirement, General Washington is even greater than he was during the Revolution.”

Lafayette understood greatness to lie in what one chooses not to do. Washington's decision in 1783 to relinquish command of the Continental Army shocked the world. His further refusal to seek a third presidential term solidified his status as a latter-day Cincinnatus, the Roman leader who returned to his farm rather than cling to power. King George III, upon hearing that Washington intended to resign, said that his decision would make him “the greatest man in the world.” Lafayette also believed that Washington wasn't the father of just his country, calling him the “patriarch” of liberty. In 1790, after the storming of the Bastille announced the advent of the French Revolution, Lafayette sent Washington the key to the notorious prison, which still hangs at Mount Vernon.

Would-be Washingtons like the Hungarian Lajos Kossuth, foreign royalty such as Prince Albert (later King Edward VII), and fellow cigar smokers including Winston Churchill and Fidel Castro—a steady parade of visitors have made their way to Mount Vernon. When Prince Albert visited, in 1860, a London newspaper noted the irony of royalty paying tribute to someone who had refused a crown: “Without royal state, royalty contemplated the last abode of one who, though once pronounced a rebel and a traitor by the very ancestors of the prince, now ranks above all kings.”

Lindsay Chervinsky: The ‘dirty and nasty people' who became Americans

In 1969, Washington caught the attention of a recent Austrian immigrant. Schwarzenegger, who was a fan of Richard Nixon, was given a book incorrectly listing the first president as a member of the Republican Party. He was led to believe that the Founding Father, who was famous for having no political party, was “where it all began” for the GOP. Schwarzenegger still has the book in his office, but his appreciation of Washington has gained a sounder historical footing over time.

Like many other leaders, Schwarzenegger is particularly fascinated by Washington's willingness to step aside. “When he was offered the ultimate power, he refused it,” he told me. “He could have run another five times, but he didn't. He went back to farming. To me, that is the ultimate of great.” After two terms as governor, Schwarzenegger didn't retire to agricultural pursuits—unless you count his miniature pony, miniature donkey, pig, and two dogs. “Instead of going back to a farm, I went back to blowing things up on movie sets,” he wrote in 2021.

Yet there is a certain parallel, evident in the way that Washington's legacy speaks to those who conceive of leadership not as wielding power, but as civic stewardship. And the annual naturalization ceremony at Mount Vernon proves that this vision still matters. It matters to the 100 new citizens who took their oath. It matters to an immigrant who became governor. And it matters to a country constantly negotiating what it means to be American and what it means to be great.

“Not in my wildest dreams,” Schwarzenegger said, “did I think that one day this immigrant would be asked to lay a wreath at George Washington's tomb.”

How missed flood warnings and infrastructure gaps cost so many lives in central Texas.

At least 90 people have died in central Texas in extraordinary floods, the deadliest in the Lone Star State since Hurricane Harvey killed 89 people.

A torrential downpour started off the July 4 weekend with several months' worth of rain falling in a few hours, lifting water levels in the Guadalupe River as high as 22 feet. Among the dead are 27 children and counselors at a summer camp near Kerrville in Kerr County. One adult at the camp may have died trying to rescue children. More people are still missing, and more rain is in the forecast.

The storm arose from the fading remnants of Tropical Storm Barry, which formed on June 28. It was well ahead of schedule for the typical second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which usually forms in mid-July. The weather system parked over Texas where it converged with a band of moisture moving north, forming thunderstorms that squeezed out a torrential downpour. 

With its topography of hills and rivers as well as a history of sudden downpours, this region in Texas has been dubbed “flash flood alley.” Kerrville itself experienced a deadly flood in 1987 when the Guadalupe River received 11 inches of rain in less than five hours, raising water in some portions by 29 feet. The flood killed 10 people. 

But there were several factors that converged to make this storm so deadly — and not all of them had to do with the sheer amount of rain. Here are some things to know about disasters like this:

Kerr County, population 54,000, is a couple hundred miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico, but it has a history of tropical storms and hurricanes passing through the region on occasion. So the leftovers from Tropical Storm Barry reaching the area isn't too surprising. Scientists, however, are still trying to find out how storms that are powered by warm ocean water continue to get energy over land. 

The recent flooding is occurring in an era where even “ordinary” storms are becoming more dangerous. Strong thunderstorms and tornadoes are a common sight in Texas summer skies and the state has a history of deadly floods. Over the years, the amount of rain falling from major storms has been increasing. 

As average temperatures rise due to climate change, air can retain more moisture, which means when storms occur, there's more water falling out of the sky, turning roads into rivers and submerging the landscape. 

Ahead of the Texas floods, the Texas Division of Emergency Management activated its emergency response system on July 2 in anticipation of major floods, including mobilizing water rescue squads, helicopters, and road-clearing equipment. On July 3, the National Weather Service issued a flood watch. (NPR has a very useful timeline of the planning and response to the floods.) 

But as the watches turned to warnings, they revealed gaps in the communication system. There are spots along the Guadalupe River that don't have flood warning sirens, including Kerr County. Officials there contemplated installing a flood warning system, but it was rejected for being too expensive. 

Text message alerts did go out, but they were sent in the middle of the night after the July Fourth holiday, when many people were camping or traveling in unfamiliar places. Parts of the county also have spotty cell service. And residents who did get the alerts weren't sure what to do about them, whether to stay or evacuate, until the water levels were perilously high. 

The National Weather Service this year has lost 600 employees between layoffs, buyouts, and retirements spurred by the Trump administration's “Department of Government Efficiency.” That included Paul Yura, the warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service Austin/San Antonio office, which is responsible for Kerr County. However, National Weather Service staff said the office was operating normally during the floods and wasn't dealing with a staff shortage. 

In general, natural disasters are killing fewer people over time. There are a lot of reasons why, like stronger building codes that can better resist fires, floods, and earthquakes. 

One of the most important lifesaving trends is better warning systems ahead of huge storms. Improvements in observations, a growing understanding of the underlying physics, and advances in computer modeling have led forecasters to build up their lead time ahead of severe weather. Researchers are even starting to get more forewarnings about volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. 

But warnings are only effective if people have the knowledge and the tools to react to them. During floods, people often underestimate currents and try to cross dangerous submerged areas. “Purposely driving or walking into floodwaters accounts for more than 86% of total flood fatalities,” according to a study of flood deaths in the US between 1959 and 2019. 

It is possible to protect lives against the forces of nature, but it requires a lot of parts working together — planning, infrastructure, forecasting, alerts, and evacuations. 

Not necessarily, but the baselines are changing. 

Most assessments of flood risk are based on historical data. Local, state, and federal agencies can map out high watermarks of the past and show which properties might be at the greatest risk. But at best, these maps are conservative estimates; they don't show the full potential of where water can reach. Often, flood maps aren't revised regularly and don't take into account how the risk landscape is changing. 

For instance, more construction in an area can lead to more impervious surfaces that retain water or shunt it toward a certain neighborhood. Losing natural watersheds that normally soak up rain can increase the probability of floods. Overdrawing groundwater can cause land to sink. 

In coastal areas, rising sea levels are increasing the reach of coastal flooding, while rainstorms inland are pouring out more water. Disasters can also compound each other. A major wildfire can wipe out trees and grasses anchoring soil, leading to floods and landslides when the rain comes, for example. 

Inflation, growing populations, and rising property values mean that when floods do occur, they extract a much bigger price from the economy. Kerr County's population has grown about 25 percent since 2000. 

As a result, when it comes to floods, many people don't even realize that they're at risk. And even in the wake of a major inundation, the lessons are quickly forgotten. 

One analysis showed that people buy more flood insurance after a major flood recedes, but gradually, they let their policies lapse, returning to the baseline insurance rate in three years in some cases. That's why one of the biggest challenges in disaster risk reduction is simply trying to get people to understand that bad things can happen to them and they should prepare.

And 3 reasons that explain it.

Throughout Zohran Mamdani's campaign for New York City mayor, he's faced a barrage of attacks that have only gotten worse since he handily won the Democratic primary two weeks ago. And this isn't just happening at the local level; New York City's mayoral race has drawn attention from across the country, and politicians and pundits have been fearmongering about Mamdani from afar.

Here's just a sampling:

On X, US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) shared a photo of the Statue of Liberty dressed in a burqa shortly after Mamdani's victory, saying, “This hits hard.” US Rep. Brandon Gill, of Texas, criticized Mamdani for eating with his hands, saying, “Civilized people in America don't eat like this.” US Rep. Andy Ogles, of Tennessee, who referred to the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor as “Zohran ‘little Muhammad' Mamdani,” called for Mamdani to be denaturalized and deported. And shortly after Mamdani's primary win, David Frum, an Atlantic staff writer, posted on X, “Well, at least we can retire that faded and false line, ‘antisemitism has no place in New York City.'”

It's also not just conservatives. In an interview on CNN, US Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) said, “I don't associate myself with what [Mamdani] has said about the Jewish people,” without expanding on what, exactly, Mamdani has said. (While Mamdani has criticized Zionism and the Israeli government, he has not said anything negative about Jewish people.) Kirsten Gillibrand, New York's Democratic senator, falsely claimed that Mamdani had made “references to global jihad” in a radio interview. She later apologized to Mamdani, according to her team, “for mischaracterizing Mamdani's record and for her tone.” 

Anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant bigotry is, of course, not a new feature of American politics. But how emboldened public figures clearly feel to make such brazen and openly racist statements seems to have reached a fever pitch. Since when, for example, is it acceptable to call on deporting American citizens? Here are three reasons why the racism against Mamdani in particular has been so extreme:

The kind of rhetoric directed at Mamdani is a product of an era of politics where hate speech and cruelty have become normalized. That has made public figures far more comfortable saying things in public that they might have thought twice about before. Stephen Miller, a senior Trump administration official, said that New York City is “the clearest warning yet of what happens to a society when it fails to control migration. Even the president's son retweeted a post that said, “I'm old enough to remember when New Yorkers endured 9/11 instead of voting for it,” adding, “New York City has fallen.” It's no longer shocking to see members of Congress, pundits, and business leaders criticizing entire peoples and cultures within the US as un-American.

In addition, President Donald Trump has pushed anti-immigrant rhetoric since he launched his campaign for president in 2015, and has only become more extreme in return to office. In this new era, meanness is not only politically rewarded but openly embraced and promoted by the White House and a variety of official online accounts. Trump's White House, for example, has turned videos of deportations into memes, taken dehumanizing photo ops, and used AI-generated images to make light of genuinely cruel policies. This kind of politics has made hate speech all the more acceptable. 

Part of the reason the attacks on Mamdani — who was born in Uganda and is of Indian descent — have been so widespread is precisely because this type of rhetoric gets spewed from the very top of American politics and government on a regular basis. 

Since Mamdani's recent rise in New York City politics, there have been calls to deport him despite the fact that he moved to New York with his family when he was 7 and became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 2018. Trump himself has threatened to arrest Mamdani, saying, “Look, we don't need a communist in this country.” That we are now at a point where we're talking about deporting citizens is a new low, but it is a direct product of Trump's style of politics, which has ushered in a new era of online bullying, extreme xenophobia, and open racism.

As I wrote last year, anti-Palestinian racism specifically targets people because they support the cause of Palestinian liberation — even if they aren't Palestinian themselves. This is why crackdowns on college campus protests were so extreme, and why the Trump administration has detained and attempted to deport international students, including non-Palestinians, simply because of what they have said about Israel. 

Mamdani isn't Palestinian, but has been a vocal critic of Israel and has a history of organizing and advocating for Palestinian rights. Like many activists in pro-Palestinian spaces, Mamdani has been baselessly smeared as antisemitic. That's why comments like Frum's have cropped up since Mamdani won his primary: By supporting Palestinians, Mamdani is inherently viewed as a threat — not just to Israel but to Jewish people as a whole. 

Frum, for example, later posted on X about the NYC primary, “[...]people with zero (or worse) regard for Jewish life and Jewish safety scolding actual Jews about how wrong and stupid we are about Jewish life and Jewish safety.” But this has nothing to do with what Mamdani has said about Jewish people. In fact, Mamdani's platform also includes addressing antisemitism in the city by dramatically increasing funding for hate-crime prevention.

Anti-Palestinian racism is still an acceptable form of bigotry that we often see displayed in American politics and media without receiving the kind of pushback that other forms of racism do. It also results in amplifying other forms of racism when its victims come from other marginalized groups. “Like many other forms of hate, there can be intersectionalities, and that's also true when it's allies of ours who are speaking for Palestinian human rights,” one expert told me last year. “If it's a Black ally, we will see anti-Black racism. If it's an Indigenous ally, we will see anti-Indigenous racism. [If it's] queer allies, trans allies, we will see homophobic and anti-queer rhetoric.”

Anti-Muslim bigotry has long been a constant in American politics, and it has been especially potent since the War on Terror. Former President Barack Obama, for example, was accused of being Muslim — as though that would disqualify him from public office — even though he is a Christian. Since Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar were elected to Congress in 2018, they have been routinely victimized by smear campaigns and hate speech that has specifically targeted their identities. Tlaib, for example, has been accused by her colleagues in Congress of engaging in “antisemitic activity” and “sympathizing with terrorist organizations.” And at a fundraiser, Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado called Omar the “jihad squad.” 

Now, Mamdani is seeing his own Muslim background be weaponized against him. He has been said to come “from a culture that lies about everything,” that he is uncivilized, and that he is a threat to people's safety simply because New York might have a “Muslim mayor.” 

There are still several months until New Yorkers head to the polls to vote for a new mayor in the general election. And unfortunately, this kind of open bigotry against Mamdani is likely to only get worse as Election Day nears. But while the attacks on Mamdani might seem like just one attempt at bringing down a candidate in a local race, their ultimate effect is much more damaging: They will make US politics all the more toxic and will only further normalize this kind of extreme bigotry against Muslims and immigrants in America.

﻿The strongest defense can be summed up in just two words.

The public tends to dislike big budget bills, and the way they're passed.

It cuts taxes, slashes the safety net, funds deportations, harms the clean energy industry, and sends the debt soaring.

This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with Risa Morimoto, a senior lecturer in economics at SOAS University of London, in England. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

Students always cheat. 

I've been a lecturer for 18 years, and I've dealt with cheating throughout that time, but with AI tools becoming widely available in recent years, I've experienced a significant change.

There are definitely positive aspects to AI. It's much easier to get access to information and students can use these tools to improve their writing, spelling, and grammar, so there are fewer badly written essays.

However, I believe some of my students have been using AI to generate essay content that pulls information from the internet, instead of using material from my classes to complete their assignments.

AI is supposed to help us work efficiently, but my workload has skyrocketed because of it. I have to spend lots of time figuring out whether the work students are handing in was really written by them.

I've decided to take dramatic action, changing the way I assess students to encourage them to be more creative and rely less on AI. The world is changing, so universities can't stand still.

I've worked at SOAS University of London since 2012. My teaching focus is ecological economics.

Initially, my teaching style was exam-based, but I found that students were anxious about one-off exams, and their results wouldn't always correspond to their performance.

I eventually pivoted to a focus on essays. Students chose their topic and consolidated theories into an essay. It worked well — until AI came along.

Cheating used to be easier to spot. I'd maybe catch one or two students cheating by copying huge chunks of text from internet sources, leading to a plagiarism case. Even two or three years ago, detecting inappropriate AI use was easier due to signs like robotic writing styles.

Now, with more sophisticated AI technologies, it's harder to detect, and I believe the scale of cheating has increased. 

I'll read 100 essays and some of them will be very similar using identical case examples, that I've never taught.

These examples are typically referenced on the internet, which makes me think the students are using an AI tool that is incorporating them. Some of the essays will cite 20 pieces of literature, but not a single one will be something from the reading list I set.

While students can use examples from internet sources in their work, I'm concerned that some students have just used AI to generate the essay content without reading or engaging with the original source.

I started using AI detection tools to assess work, but I'm aware this technology has limitations. 

AI tools are easy to access for students who feel pressured by the amount of work they have to do. University fees are increasing, and a lot of students work part-time jobs, so it makes sense to me that they want to use these tools to complete work more quickly.

During the first lecture of my module, I'll tell students they can use AI to check grammar or summarize the literature to better understand it, but they can't use it to generate responses to their assignments.

SOAS has guidance for AI use among students, which sets similar principles about not using AI to generate essays.

Over the past year, I've sat on an academic misconduct panel at the university, dealing with students who've been flagged for inappropriate AI use across departments. 

I've seen students refer to these guidelines and say that they only used AI to support their learning and not to write their responses.

It can be hard to make decisions because you can't be 100% sure from reading the essay whether it's AI-generated or not. It's also hard to draw a line between cheating and using AI to support learning.

My colleagues and I speak about the negative and positive aspects of AI, and we're aware that we still have a lot to learn about the technology ourselves.

The university is encouraging lecturers to change their teaching and assessment practices. At the department level, we often discuss how to improve things.

I send my two young children to a school with an alternative, progressive education system, rather than a mainstream British state school. Seeing how my kids are educated has inspired me to try two alternative assessment methods this coming academic year. I had to go through a formal process with the university to get them approved.

I'll ask my students to choose a topic and produce a summary of what they learned in the class about it. Second, they'll create a blog, so they can translate what they've understood of the highly technical terms into a more communicable format.

My aim is to make sure the assignments are directly tied to what we've learned in class and make assessments more personal and creative. 

The old assessment model, which involves memorizing facts and regurgitating them in exams, isn't useful anymore. ChatGPT can easily give you a beautiful summary of information like this. Instead, educators need to help students with soft skills, communication, and out-of-the-box thinking.

In a statement to BI, a SOAS spokesperson said students are guided to use AI in ways that ""uphold academic integrity."" They said the university encouraged students to pursue work that is harder for AI to replicate and have ""robust mechanisms"" in place for investigating AI misuse. ""The use of AI is constantly evolving, and we are regularly reviewing and updating our policies to respond to these changes,"" the spokesperson added.

Last year, Jane Street Group sued Millennium Management for allegedly stealing its secret trade ideas. Jane Street had employed a couple of traders who discovered a trading strategy in the [redacted] market. Jane Street did some initial testing and found results that were “counterintuitive, unexpected, and initially met with significant skepticism and incredulity internally at Jane Street”: It made so much money that everyone thought it was a mistake. Jane Street started running the strategy in the [redacted] market and made a lot of money. Eventually the traders left for Millennium, and then Millennium allegedly started running the same strategy, eating into Jane Street's incredible profits.

In its lawsuit, Jane Street did not describe the strategy, or even name the [redacted] market in which it was operating, because “even identifying the country involved would lead to others ‘picking apart' the details.” But in a court hearing, Millennium's lawyers repeatedly said that the strategy involved options trades in India, “at multiple points apologizing to the judge for doing so.” Oops!

Trump's Second Term:

Blackouts in the US could double by 2030 amid an expected increase in power demand brought on by AI, according to a Trump administration report that blames the expected energy shortfall on the closures of coal and natural gas power plants and overreliance on renewable energy.

A 100% “surge in power outages” is expected within five years if planned power plant closures remain on schedule without new units to replace them, the Energy Department, which is releasing the report on Monday, said in a statement. “Staying on the present course would undermine U.S. economic growth, national security, and leadership in emerging technologies,” it said.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Russia's sacked transport minister has been found dead in his car outside Moscow with a gunshot wound and the principal hypothesis is that he took his own life, state investigators said on Monday, hours after President Vladimir Putin fired him.

A presidential decree published earlier on Monday gave no reason for the dismissal of Roman Starovoit after barely a year in the job, though political analysts were quick to raise the possibility that he may have been dismissed in connection with an investigation into corruption in the region he once ran.

Reuters could not independently confirm these suggestions, though a transport industry source, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said Starovoit's position had been in question for months due to questions about the same corruption scandal, which centred on funds earmarked for fortifying Russia's border with Ukraine in the Kursk region.

There were conflicting reports about the timing of Starovoit's death. Russia's Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, said in a statement it was working to establish the precise circumstances.

Various Russian media cited law enforcement sources as saying a pistol belonging to Starovoit had been found alongside his body in his car.

Before being appointed transport minister in May 2024, Starovoit had been governor of the Kursk region for nearly five years.

Three months after he became transport minister, Ukrainian troops crossed the border into Kursk in the biggest foreign incursion into Russian territory since World War Two and were only pushed out earlier this year after fierce fighting and widespread destruction.

In April this year, Starovoit's successor as governor, Alexei Smirnov, was charged with embezzling money earmarked for defence purposes amid accusations that the funds earmarked for border defences had been stolen, leaving Kursk more vulnerable to Ukrainian attack.    

Pressed earlier on Monday by reporters on whether his dismissal meant Putin had lost trust in Starovoit over Kursk, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said ""a loss of trust is mentioned if there is a loss of trust"".

""There is no such wording in the (Kremlin) decree.""

Starovoit's dismissal comes at a time of significant challenges for Russia's transport sector as the war in Ukraine drags on for a fourth year.

Russia's aviation sector is short of spare parts and Russian Railways, the country's largest employer, is grappling with soaring interest costs as high rates - needed to curb higher inflation exacerbated by the war - take their toll. 

The Kremlin said Andrei Nikitin, a former governor of the Novgorod region, had been appointed acting transport minister and it published photographs of him shaking hands with Putin in the Kremlin.

Asked about Nikitin's swift appointment, Kremlin spokesman Peskov said: ""At present, in the president's opinion, Andrei Nikitin's professional qualities and experience will best contribute to ensuring that this agency, which the president described as extremely important, fulfils its tasks and functions.""

Two transport industry sources said plans to replace Starovoit with Nikitin had been in the works since before last month's International Economic Forum in St. Petersburg. 

The transport ministry declined to comment on Monday.

At his meeting with Putin, Nikitin spoke about working on the huge task of digitising Russia's transport industry in an effort to reduce cargo bottlenecks and ensure smoother cross-border flows of goods.

In this article

White House trade advisor Peter Navarro criticized Apple CEO Tim Cook on Monday over the company's response to pressure from the Trump administration to make more of its products outside China.

""Going back to the first Trump term, Tim Cook has continually asked for more time in order to move his factories out of China,"" Navarro said in an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" ""I mean it's the longest-running soap opera in Silicon Valley.""

CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment on Navarro's criticism.

President Donald Trump has in recent months ramped up demands for Apple to move production of its iconic iPhone to the U.S. from overseas. Apple's flagship phone is produced primarily in China, but the company has increasingly boosted production in India, partly to avoid the higher cost of Trump's tariffs.

Trump in May warned Apple would have to pay a tariff of 25% or more for iPhones made outside the U.S. In separate remarks, Trump said he told Cook, ""I don't want you building in India.""

Analysts and supply chain experts have argued it would be impossible for Apple to completely move iPhone production to the U.S. By some estimates, a U.S.-made iPhone could cost as much as $3,500.

Navarro said Cook isn't shifting production out of China quickly enough.

""With all these new advanced manufacturing techniques and the way things are moving with AI and things like that, it's inconceivable to me that Tim Cook could not produce his iPhones elsewhere around the world and in this country,"" Navarro said.

Apple currently makes very few products in the U.S. During Trump's first term, Apple extended its commitment to assemble the $3,000 Mac Pro in Texas.

In February, Apple said it would spend $500 billion within the U.S., including on assembling some AI servers.

In this article

Tesla stock fell about 7% on Monday after CEO Elon Musk announced plans to form a new political party.

The stock was on pace for its worst day since June 5, when it fell 14% as the clash between Musk and President Donald Trump erupted.

Musk said Saturday that the party would be called the ""America Party"" and could focus ""on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts."" He suggested this would be ""enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws, ensuring that they serve the true will of the people.""

The billionaire's involvement in politics has been a point of contention for investors. Musk earlier this year was instrumental in the so-called Department of Government Efficiency and worked closely with Trump — a move seen as potentially hurting Tesla's brand.

Musk left DOGE in May, which helped Tesla's stock.

Now the tech billionaire's reinvolvement in the political arena is making investors nervous.

""Very simply Musk diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take during this crucial period for the Tesla story,"" Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, said in a note Sunday.

""While the core Musk supporters will back Musk at every turn no matter what, there is broader sense of exhaustion from many Tesla investors that Musk keeps heading down the political track,"" he wrote.

Musk's previous political foray earned him Trump's praise in the early days, but he has since drawn the ire of the U.S. president.

The two have clashed over various areas of policy, including Trump's spending bill, which Musk has said would increase America's debt burden. Musk has taken issue with particular cuts to tax credits and support for solar and wind energy and electric vehicles.

Trump on Sunday called Musk's move to form a political party ""ridiculous,"" adding that the Tesla boss had gone ""completely off the rails.""

Musk is contending with more than just political turmoil. Tesla reported a 14% year-on-year decline in car deliveries in the second quarter, missing expectations. The company is facing rising competition, especially in its key market, China.

A new Ethereum proposal, co-authored by Vitalik Buterin and Toni Wahrstaetter,  aims to impose a hard cap on the maximum gas a transaction can consume in a move developers say could strengthen network stability and make the chain more viable for certain applications.

The proposal, EIP-7983, suggests limiting individual transactions to 16,777,216 gas (2²⁴) — a sharp change from the current design which technically allows a single transaction to consume the entire block gas limit.

As of Monday, a single Ethereum transaction can consume as much gas as an entire block allows — a design choice that introduces several performance and security challenges.

When a single transaction consumes nearly all the available gas, it disrupts the distribution of workloads across the network and tends to make block execution less efficient.

Developers working on zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVM) have found it difficult to process large transactions in parallel, often defaulting to splitting work across multiple transactions instead.

And for parallel execution engines, wildly varying gas sizes introduce imbalance across processing threads

Proponents say that the cap would simplify these pain points.

“16,777,216 is nice because it makes it easier to subdivide things, potentially simplifying downstream engineering,” one contributor wrote in the GitHub thread. Others argued it aligned with Ethereum's longer-term shift toward modularity and provability.

The new ceiling would require splitting some large transactions, such as contract deployments, into smaller chunks. Authors of the proposal stated that most real-world activities already fall well below the limit, and edge cases are minimal.

EIP-7983 builds on earlier resource-bounding initiatives, such as EIP-7825, and signals a growing consensus that Ethereum's base layer should enforce tighter execution guarantees as it scales.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, July  07, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Little Pepe, a new entrant in the crypto space blending meme culture with scalable blockchain infrastructure, today announced it has successfully raised $4 million in its presale and launched a custom EVM-compatible Layer 2 blockchain. The milestone marks a major step forward for the project as it positions itself as a next-generation meme coin ecosystem on Ethereum's Layer 2 landscape.

The presale, currently in its fourth phase, has seen increasing investor demand, with tokens priced at $0.0013 and available exclusively via the project's website: LittlePepe.com. The funds raised are being used to further develop the Little Pepe Layer 2 network, which is now operational and optimized for fast, low-cost transactions.

“Most meme tokens exist as basic ERC-20 assets. We've taken it a step further by creating a fully functioning Layer 2 chain designed specifically for meme-based applications,” said a spokesperson for Little Pepe. “This infrastructure is what sets us apart.”

Custom Layer 2 Blockchain Built for Memes

The Little Pepe blockchain is a dedicated Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 chain that brings high speed, minimal fees, and seamless developer compatibility to the meme coin space. Designed with scalability and community use in mind, the network aims to support social dApps, NFT platforms, and other meme-driven utilities, offering developers a purpose-built alternative to congested mainnets.

Unlike many meme coins that rely purely on social media hype, Little Pepe's approach is centered on building an actual ecosystem—complete with EVM compatibility and room for technical growth.

Organic Growth and Community Momentum

In contrast to high-budget token launches, Little Pepe has opted for an organic growth model fueled by grassroots support on platforms like Telegram and X (formerly Twitter). The project's community-first approach has attracted attention across crypto circles for its blend of humor, utility, and long-term potential.

A New Category: Infrastructure-Backed Meme Coins

Little Pepe is part of a rising trend of “infrastructure-backed meme tokens,” combining internet culture with robust blockchain architecture. The project continues to embrace its fun, irreverent identity—complete with Pepe-inspired visuals—while building serious tools for long-term growth.

“People don't expect meme coins to come with their own chain. We're changing that expectation,” the spokesperson added.

About Little PepeLittle Pepe is a next-gen Layer 2 blockchain project designed to merge meme culture with high-speed, low-cost decentralized infrastructure. Built for scalability, security, and developer flexibility, Little Pepe supports EVM-compatible applications and is powered by the $LILPEPE token. Its mission is to create a meme coin environment where community engagement meets serious tech innovation.

	You are here:
Influencer Marketing Hub » Creator Economy » How Marketers Use No-Code Platforms to Scale Influencer NFT Drops

Modern influencer campaigns demand both speed and authenticity for success. But that demands asking two key questions: 

Emerging no-code Web3 creator tools are answering these questions by abstracting smart-contract complexity and automating metadata pipelines.

A clear pattern across hundreds of influencer-led campaigns is the shift toward design-centric workflows—whether “sharing to StarChive” from Canva, clicking a “Create NFT” button in Starchive, or using ThirdWeb's drag-and-drop contract templates.

Another trend is the demand for seamless audience onboarding: gas-free minting, fiat checkout options, and wallet-agnostic interfaces address the high drop-off rates seen when followers encounter technical hurdles.

This article explores those platforms—comparing their strengths and weaknesses, evaluating how they integrate into influencer briefs and campaign calendars, and recommending strategic frameworks for marketers to turn token drops into high-impact, code-free activations.




In an influencer campaign, every step—from drafting the creative brief to executing on-chain activations—must align with brand goals, timelines, and talent workflows. When marketers attempt NFT launches without coding expertise, they introduce bottlenecks that ripple across deliverables, slow down negotiated partnership milestones, and dilute campaign ROI.

Recognizing these technical traps upfront enables brand teams to integrate NFT drops seamlessly into influencer briefs and cadence plans, ensuring that creators can focus on storytelling and engagement rather than wrestling with blockchain mechanics.

Marketers embarking on NFT initiatives face a constellation of operational and technical obstacles that erode speed-to-market and inflate resource demands. First, smart contract complexity imposes steep learning curves: defining token standards, enumerating metadata attributes, and configuring royalty splits often requires developer intervention or in-house solidity expertise. This barrier directly conflicts with agency KPIs around rapid ideation and testing, forcing teams into lengthy build sprints or reliance on scarce blockchain developers.

Second, metadata orchestration remains a persistent pain point. Influencer campaigns frequently employ generative-art frameworks that emit thousands of images and JSON trait files.

 

Check out the How Influencers Are Monetizing NFTs Without Launching Their Own Collection

However, many no-code platforms demand a single, consolidated manifest. Marketers then spend hours merging disparate trait files, reconciling naming conventions, and ensuring IPFS or Web3 storage links align. This manual chore negates much of the value promised by “drag-and-drop” minting interfaces and introduces the risk of misaligned metadata, which can break mint cycles or create mismatches in on-chain records.

Third, gas-fee volatility and multi-chain uncertainty complicate budget forecasts. Agencies accustomed to CPM and CPC models now must allocate flexible budgets for mint and transfer fees that fluctuate with network congestion.

Without built-in gas-optimization or subsidy mechanisms, campaigns can stall or balloon beyond approved spend. Additionally, determining the optimal chain—balancing audience reach, cost, and security demands research into emerging Layer-2 solutions and sidechains. This evaluative exercise distracts marketers from core campaign strategy and dilutes time spent on audience segmentation and creative development.

Fourth, user onboarding friction transcends technical challenges. Converting an influencer's followers into NFT buyers requires seamless wallet setup, marketplace registration, and education on crypto fundamentals. Even simple wallet connections via MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet can confuse non-crypto-native audiences, leading to drop-off before checkout.

Where traditional e-commerce leverages familiar credit-card flows, the NFT journey often demands cross-platform app installs or private key management—frictions that depress conversion rates and leave marketers scrambling for user-friendly alternatives.

Finally, brand consistency and compliance present governance hurdles. Deploying on public marketplaces like OpenSea affords exposure but limits customization of branding, UI, and legal terms. Conversely, white-label SDKs grant stylistic control but require technical integration and ongoing maintenance.

Additionally, marketers must navigate emerging regulatory frameworks around KYC/AML, ensuring token-gated experiences do not inadvertently violate local jurisdictions—an ever-shifting landscape that necessitates in-depth legal consultation.

When these hurdles are addressed strategically, brands can transform NFT drops from technical experiments into high-impact, creator-led engagements. This alignment ensures that influencers spend their energy crafting authentic messaging rather than troubleshooting smart contracts, preserving brand trust and accelerating campaign timelines.

 

Check out the Top Crypto & NFT Promotional Campaigns Redefining Industry Success

Influencer marketers must assess no-code NFT platforms not just on technical specs, but on how they integrate with campaign briefs, approval gates, and creative calendars.

The right platform acts as the central hub for talent coordination, handling everything from drop scheduling in an influencer content calendar to automated royalty reconciliation across each creator's wallet.

By applying evaluation criteria through this operational lens, agencies can ensure seamless execution across creative, legal, and analytics teams.

By rigorously applying these criteria through an influencer-campaign lens, marketers can select platforms that not only simplify technical execution but also harmonize with creative workflows, legal milestones, and post-launch analytics.

This cohesion transforms NFT initiatives from one-off tech pilots into scalable, repeatable influencer-driven activations that drive both brand equity and measurable business KPIs.

 

Check out the Top Crypto & NFT Promotional Strategies Used by Leading Brands (with Examples)

Influencer marketers must assess no-code NFT platforms not only on feature sets but on how they enable scalable multi-creator activations.

The ideal solution functions as a centralized “brief-to-mint” hub, streamlining content handoffs, co-approval loops, and drop-day coordination across dozens—or even hundreds—of—influencers.

Evaluating platforms through this lens ensures that each creator's deliverables, compensation triggers, and community outreach align with brand timelines and KPIs.

ThirdWeb has quickly become a go-to solution for marketers seeking enterprise-grade NFT deployment without blockchain engineering teams.

Since its 2021 launch, it's powered drops for global brands like Shopify and The Sandbox, evidencing strong product-market fit. Rather than building contracts from scratch, users leverage ThirdWeb's audited, parameterized modules, dramatically reducing security risk and time-to-market.

It's hosted dashboard further abstracts blockchain endpoints, enabling campaign managers to monitor mint performance and revenue in real time. ThirdWeb's open-source SDK fosters active community contributions, but this breadth of options can overwhelm non-technical users, occasionally necessitating developer consultation to implement advanced flows (e.g., lazy minting, cross-chain bridging).

Despite robust documentation, learning the nuances of gas-optimization settings or multi-phase drop scripts may introduce operational friction for teams without dedicated Web3 specialists.

Key strengths include:

OpenSea remains the market leader in NFT discovery and secondary-market liquidity, capturing approximately 42% of active users across top marketplaces. Its breadth of categories—from art and gaming to domain names—attracts diverse audiences, making it a powerful amplification channel for influencer-led drops seeking secondary-market visibility.

The platform's native royalty engine enforces up to 10% resale fees, ensuring influencers benefit from aftermarket activity. However, OpenSea's templated collection pages lack flexible theming, which can disrupt cohesive brand experiences when audiences navigate from social channels to the marketplace. Additionally, fee structures( 2.5% marketplace cut plus creator royalties) require careful upfront modeling to maintain campaign profitability.

While OpenSea's API grants real-time floor-price and volume feeds for post-drop analytics, higher-tier usage demands paid access and rate-limits that can hinder rapid iteration across multiple influencer activations.

Its strengths include:

Coinbase NFT review!

 ♬ Witch Familiar (Classical) [Classic](143628) - dice 

 

Coinbase NFT launched with a 1.5 million–member waitlist, signaling strong mainstream appetite for simplified NFT commerce. By integrating seamlessly with Coinbase Wallet, it obviates the need for browser extensions or third-party wallets, lowering onboarding friction for non-crypto-native influencer audiences.

Its aggregated marketplace structure sources listings across Ethereum and Polygon, automatically routing users to the lowest-fee option. From a brand perspective, Coinbase's rigorous KYC/AML compliance and SOC 2 security posture deliver institutional confidence, making it attractive for regulated industries.

On the flip side, as a beta offering, its tooling for bulk metadata uploads, whitelisting, and collection insights remains rudimentary. Furthermore, upfront fee schedules (mint, listing, and service fees) are still evolving, complicating precise financial planning for agency campaigns with tight ROI targets.

Key strengths:

Weaknesses:



Starchive provides a unified DAM-to-NFT pipeline, enabling marketers and influencer networks to mint directly from their existing asset repositories. Its desktop and mobile clients support one-click NFT creation—complete with IPFS pinning—while hosting on eco-conscious Polygon/Palm sidechains.

The native Canva plugin further embeds mint-ready workflows into designers' preferred environment: influencers simply “share to Starchive” to queue assets for approval and drop scheduling. Starchive's granular share-link controls double as whitelisting mechanisms for private pre-sales and VIP influencer tiers.

However, its sidechain focus restricts immediate compatibility with Ethereum-centric marketplaces, requiring manual bridging for broader exposure. Additionally, advanced analytics and cohort segmentation for multi-influencer activations are still nascent features.

Strengths include:

 ♬ LoFi Hip Hop with an urban feel(837632) - akito misaki 

 

Mintable offers an accessible entry point for creators, having processed over 50 million transactions since 2018. Its flagship gas-free “lazy minting” defers blockchain recording until purchase, eliminating upfront costs and aligning well with influencer campaigns on tight budgets.

The platform's step-by-step UI guides non-technical influencers through asset upload, metadata tagging, and listing type selection (auction vs. fixed price). User reviews praise its zero-fee model, but they also highlight potential buyer friction: deferred minting can inflate end-user costs and obscure token provenance until sale confirmation.

Mintable's built-in analytics track item views, favorites, and sales, feeding directly into creator performance reports. However, the absence of white-label customization and limited IP verification controls pose brand-risk challenges for high-profile influencer partnerships.

Check out the 12 Best Web3 Marketing Agencies to Partner With

For influencer-led NFT initiatives, advanced capabilities become game-changers only when embedded within campaign orchestration systems. Marketers should adopt a “RACI-blockchain” model—defining who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for each on-chain event—then automate handoffs via Zapier or native APIs.

This framework ensures metadata generation, smart-contract calls, and post-mint notifications are seamlessly woven into influencer content calendars, approval boards, and performance dashboards.

Generative-Art Pipelines

Leverage Photoshop-based HashLips scripts alongside cloud storage connectors (e.g., AWS S3) to automatically push trait metadata into the mint queue. Configure auto-trigger workflows so that once an influencer's creative assets are approved in your DAM, they feed directly into the platform's manifest generator, eliminating manual steps and aligning with content-deadline milestones in your influencer brief.

Physical-Asset Authentication

Use NFC-linked NFTs for limited-edition influencer merch drops. For example, pair a signed influencer print with an on-chain token that includes scanned serial-number data. Set up a Shopify plugin that cross-verifies NFT ownership at checkout, unlocking exclusive IRL events or product bundles. This drives stronger influencer engagement by merging digital collectibles with tangible rewards.

IPFS & Metadata Decentralization

Host core campaign assets on IPFS and pin through services like Pinata. Configure your no-code platform to retrieve metadata via persistent gateways, ensuring influencer galleries remain live despite central-server outages. Link each influencer's collection page back to your CRM to log on-chain engagement events as lead-gen triggers.

CRM & Campaign Automation

Connect mint events to email/SMS platforms (e.g., Klaviyo) via webhooks. Whenever an influencer's wallet address mints a token, auto-enroll that user in a post-mint drip—delivering personalized thank-you messages from the influencer, cross-sell opportunities, or loyalty up-sell invitations. Track redemptions and secondary-market sales within your BI tools to refine creator compensation models and future campaign budgets.

By weaving these advanced capabilities into a unified influencer-campaign architecture—leveraging automation frameworks, decentralized storage best practices, and CRM integrations—brands can elevate NFT drops from novelty experiments to fully integrated influencer activations.

The result is a cohesive end-to-end experience that drives authentic engagement, measurable conversions, and scalable campaign repeatability.

Strategic alignment between brand teams, agencies, and talent is paramount for NFT launch success. To transform token drops into coordinated activations, marketers must formalize processes—mapping each NFT-related deliverable to the influencer brief, campaign calendar, and approval milestones.

Below are targeted recommendations that integrate NFT mechanics directly into influencer-UGC operations, ensuring clarity across all stakeholders and measurable impact on engagement and conversions.

Centralize NFT mechanics in your existing influencer-brief framework. Add dedicated sections for token attributes, mint schedules, and wallet setup instructions. This ensures every influencer campaign—from micro to macro—has clear milestones for asset submission, metadata approval, and drop-day promotion.

By treating NFTs as another creative deliverable rather than a stand-alone experiment, you maintain alignment with standard content calendars and reduce briefing ambiguity.

Before scaling, run a controlled drop with 5-10 key influencers to test UTM-tagged performance, conversion rates, and wallet-onboarding fidelity. Use these pilots to refine gas-fee subsidies, whitelist criteria, and post-mint email triggers.

Data from these initial cohorts will inform royalty structures and revenue-share models for larger activations, mitigating budget overruns and user-experience friction.

Design multi-tier influencer campaigns where NFT holders unlock exclusive content, AMAs, or in-person events. Integrate gating logic into your CRM so that mint events automatically segment audiences and trigger personalized nurture sequences. This drives scarcity-driven urgency, deepens community engagement, and provides tangible post-mint engagement KPIs.

Allocate a fixed pool of “gas credit” per campaign and bundle it into paid social budgets. Partner with platforms offering meta-transactions or sponsored-gas models to ensure that mint fees never derail influencer ROI. Including gas caps in contract terms prevents last-minute spend spikes and aligns financial incentives across brand, agency, and talent.

Feed real-time mint and secondary-sale data into existing marketing-automation or BI platforms (e.g., Looker, Domo). Tag each influencer's wallet addresses as unique campaign variables, enabling cross-channel attribution models that capture both on-chain and off-chain engagement.

This holistic view allows for dynamic optimization of influencer compensation, drop timing, and creative assets.

Form a cross-functional team of marketing ops, legal, and developer liaisons to document best practices, compliance matrices, and technical playbooks. This living repository should capture lessons from each drop—metadata workflows, gas-fee strategies, gating setups—and be embedded within your agency or brand's standard operating procedures to accelerate future activations.

By institutionalizing these recommendations, marketers convert NFT experiments into repeatable playbooks that amplify influencer reach and drive quantifiable KPIs. To operationalize this, adopt collaboration platforms that synchronize tasks across creative teams, legal sign-offs, and influencer partners.

This ensures every NFT milestone—from metadata approval to gated-content delivery—is visible, accountable, and optimized for maximum campaign performance.

NFTs represent more than collectible art; when integrated into influencer campaigns, they unlock new engagement models, data-driven monetization, and scarce rewards that amplify brand loyalty. By embedding NFT workflows into established brief templates, leveraging pilot cohorts for optimization, and aligning gas-fee strategies with paid-media budgets, marketers can transform token drops into scalable, performance-driven activations.

Token gating and on-chain analytics further deepen community connection and quantify revenue beyond one-time sales. As brands build internal Web3 centers of excellence, each drop becomes a repeatable blueprint, ensuring that NFTs fuel sustainable influencer ecosystems rather than one-off experiments.

Embrace NFTs strategically, and you'll turn digital scarcity into lasting brand momentum.

Artyfact has launched its first official Play-and-Earn tournament with a $30,000 prize pool. 

The competition is free to enter and available now through the Epic Games Store, with the event running until September 28. Players earn in-game points by competing in matches and can win both fixed and randomized rewards based on their ranking.

The tournament introduces a new seasonal format called “Leaderboard Rush,” where players collect ArtyPoints (AP) during gameplay. Each in-game kill is worth one AP, with an additional 25 AP awarded for winning a match. Players can also collect points during special capture events on the map. These points determine leaderboard placement and final prize payouts.

Top players are rewarded based on their final ranking. First place wins $1,500, second receives $700, and third gets $550. Players ranked from 4th to 50th earn $100 each, while those from 51st to 100th will get $55. Additionally, 900 random players will receive $22 just for participating, making this event inclusive for both casual and competitive users.

Although the game is free to play, players can increase their AP totals by holding Artyfact NFTs. Items like jetpacks, weapons, and character skins come with built-in AP bonuses. For example, owning an epic-tier NFT grants 9,900 extra AP. These items are part of the broader NFT economy that ties directly into the game's ecosystem.

Artyfact combines fast-paced shooter mechanics with Web3 elements. Powered by Unreal Engine 5 and running on Binance Smart Chain, the game supports several modes including Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Control, and Battle Royale. Features like jetpacks, transformable vehicles, and map-based power-ups make every match unpredictable.

The game also uses an AI system called Player-Experience Modeling (PEM), which adjusts difficulty based on user behavior. This helps new players ease into the experience while offering advanced challenges to more experienced users.

Alongside the tournament, Artyfact is running a 35,000 USDT airdrop. Players who complete social media and community tasks can enter, with 1,500 total winners. The campaign ends August 11, and winners will receive their rewards starting August 15.

The $ARTY token supports the entire platform. Players can stake it, use it for purchases, or join governance votes through the game's DAO. Ten percent of NFT sale revenue is burned, reducing the total supply and supporting long-term token value. $ARTY is currently traded on exchanges like OKX, KuCoin, PancakeSwap, and Bybit.

Artyfact is available now for free download on the Epic Games Store. Players don't need any crypto knowledge or a wallet to begin. Upon joining, each user receives an integrated Artyfact Wallet, allowing seamless access to the game's features. More tournament updates are expected in the coming weeks.

ICO Seeks Solutions to AdTech Privacy Troubles


                                                                                Elizabeth Greenberg

“A new approach to regulation can create opportunities to unlock business growth through innovation, while safeguarding people's privacy and improving user experience,” the UK data regulator says. 




                                                                                Elizabeth Greenberg

                                                03.30pm


The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is calling for views on a new enforcement approach that could unlock privacy-preserving alternatives to the dominant adtech business model.

The proposal – set out in a call for views on how the ICO applies regulation 6 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) – aim to support innovation by enabling new advertising models that respect user privacy while maintaining revenue streams.

Regulation 6 revolves around the processing involved in storing or accessing stored information in user devices as it applies to GDPR.

The ICO is exploring how publishers could deliver privacy-preserving advertising to users who have not given consent, where the risks are demonstratably low.

“Currently, publishers deploying online advertising technologies must secure people's consent. This is because online advertising involves storage of, or access to, information on people's devices. Storage and access technologies for online advertising purposes do not meet any of the exceptions to regulation 6 requirements,” the ICO said.

“We are exploring whether a risk-based approach to enforcing PECR could allow publishers to deliver online advertising to users who have not granted consent, where there is a low risk to their privacy.”

The regulator will continue to enforce consent requirements for the collection of personal information for targeted advertising during this exploration.

“Online advertising doesn't have to come at the expense of privacy. We want to see industry develop new models that put users in control while supporting publishers and platforms to thrive,” Stephen Almond, director of regulator risk at the ICO said.

“Our role isn't to dictate how that's done – it's to remove unnecessary regulatory barriers and open the door to responsible innovation.”

The ICO has also launched an updated consultation on its Storage and Access Technologies (SATs) guidance, revised to reflect changes introduced by the new Data (Use and Access) Act 2025. The Act permits consent-free use of cookies for certain low-risk functions, such as statistical analysis and website improvement.

The regulator believes that there may be commercially viable ways to deliver online advertising that do not require the intensive processing often undertaken with behavioural advertising.

“A new approach to regulation can create opportunities to unlock business growth through innovation, while safeguarding people's privacy and improving user experience,” the regulator contends.

“Provided users have a clear understanding that services appearing to be ‘free' are funded by advertising, they may accept some storage and access of information for functions to deliver that advertising. However, they may not accept the scale and granularity of processing often currently undertaken when they grant consent,” the ICO says.

The ICO is also commissioning further user research to better understand public attitudes to online tracking and consent, ensuring its regulatory approach is aligned with real-world expectations.

The call for views on the ICO's enforcement approach closes on Friday 29 August, while the SATs guidance consultation closes on Friday 26 September. Responses will inform the ICO's final guidance and a formal statement on its updated enforcement approach, due in early 2026.

The Information Commissioner (“ICO”) has secured a significant victory against TikTok, with the First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) (“FTT”) ruling in the ICO's favour on a key preliminary issue concerning the regulator's power to take action against online platforms hosting user-generated content.

In April 2023 the ICO imposed a £12.7 million penalty on TikTok for breaches of data protection law, including unlawful processing of the personal data of children under the age of 13yrs. TikTok appealed against the penalty, notably on the basis that the penalty was ultra vires because it was made “with respect to processing of personal data for the special purposes” (i.e. journalistic, academic, artistic or literary purposes) within the meaning of sections 156 and 174 of the Data Protection Act 2018 (“DPA”). On that basis, according to TikTok, the ICO had no power to issue the penalty notice without first obtaining prior Court approval in accordance with section 174 DPA.

The FTT ordered the issue be determined by way of a trial of a preliminary issue. In its decision released on 4 July 2025, the FTT ruled in favour of the ICO, rejecting TikTok's case that data processing  for the purposes of providing the TikTok service is processing “for the special purposes” because it is intended to enable and encourage artistic expression by TikTok users.

The FTT's decision is available here.

Gerry Facenna KC, Nikolaus Grubeck and Jenn Lawrence acted for the ICO.

A US lawmaker has introduced a draft bill aimed at updating the country's tax code as it relates to digital assets.

The move followed the exclusion of cryptocurrency provisions from the recently passed federal spending package. The proposal outlines a series of tax exemptions intended to provide clarity and reduce compliance burdens for participants in the digital asset sector.

Among the main provisions is a de minimis exemption for digital asset transactions and capital gains up to USD 300, capped at USD 5,000 annually. The bill also recommends that taxes on rewards from crypto mining and staking should only be applied when the assets are sold.

The draft legislation includes additional carve-outs for digital assets used in lending agreements and charitable contributions, effectively shielding those activities from taxation. These measures appear designed to address industry concerns around double taxation and the complexity of current reporting requirements.

Representatives from the senator's office noted that the existing tax framework is outdated in the context of emerging digital technologies, and suggested the new bill is an attempt to align regulation more closely with how decentralised systems operate in practice. They added that the proposal aims to reduce regulatory confusion and unintended tax violations.

According to Cointelegraph, digital asset taxation has become an increasingly contentious issue in the United States, with industry participants citing inconsistent rules and a lack of formal guidance. In particular, the treatment of decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms and non-custodial protocols remains unclear. These platforms often operate without a centralised operator or control over user funds, which complicates the application of existing financial regulations.

In a related development last month, members of the House Financial Services Committee introduced an amendment to the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025. The amendment proposes that developers of decentralised protocols should not be classified as money-transmitting services. If adopted, the change would relieve these entities from tax reporting obligations currently applicable to centralised exchanges and other traditional financial entities.

The Bank of Korea has stopped its mission to create a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) before the plan, named ‘Project Han River,' entered its second phase.

The project came to a halt due to growing dissatisfaction among participating banks and active discussions about introducing a won-based stablecoin led by the private sector. The first pilot test began in March with seven banks and aimed to transform deposited funds into electronic tokens for use at merchant payment locations, similar to physical cash. The project ended on the 30th, with the plans for a second pilot in October 2025 being postponed to reduce uncertainty.

The suspension of the CBDC project reflects the disagreements between the Bank of Korea and commercial banks regarding the issuance of a won stablecoin. The government's decision to create the stablecoin raised questions about the practicality of CBDCs, especially as international counterparts like the US and EU are working on stablecoin rules.

The Bank of Korea had previously agreed to share some of the costs of the second test with the banking sector to reduce financial burdens, but the growing interest in stablecoins has shifted the focus. Banks that participated, such as KB, Hana Bank, and Kakao Bank, are now focusing on capturing the stablecoin market. They applied for trademarks related to stablecoins and created a consortium to explore the issuance operations. Hana Bank plans to join this association in the near future.

Some argue that CBDCs, with their public nature, and stablecoins, which are flexibly used in the private digital landscape, can function in parallel and coexist. This could be possible using DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) or compatible infrastructure. Looking outside of Korea, countries like Hong Kong utilised both CBDCs and privately led stablecoins in their digital asset adoption process, with the appropriate regulatory framework.

Kiwoom Securities supports stablecoins backed by CBDCs but believes that there's a need for legal clarity, AML systems, and policy changes. The company's investment strategy team warns of risks from overlapping functions and urges clear standards for interoperability, issuance, and consumer protection.

U.S.-based BitMine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE American: BMNR), is rapidly transforming the world of Bitcoin and digital asset mining. By harnessing immersion cooling technology and targeting carbon neutrality, the next-gen bitcoin miner is setting new standards for efficiency, sustainability, and operational scale in the crypto sector.

With a recent surge in stock price and a $250 million capital raise, the company is drawing attention from both institutional and retail investors seeking exposure to the future of green blockchain infrastructure.

First, let's take a peek at its operations

BitMine Immersion Technologies has built a multi-faceted Bitcoin mining business designed for performance and scale. It operates four active mining sites. Two of these are located in Texas, selected for their robust energy infrastructure and access to low-cost power. The other two are in Trinidad & Tobago, where the company benefits from long-term energy contracts and high energy efficiency.

This strategic geographic mix helps BitMine maintain a balance between reliability, energy savings, and consistent uptime. Its operations include:

BitMine's mining success is because of its immersion cooling. It's a next-generation method that replaces traditional air cooling. Instead of relying on fans and air conditioners, it submerges its mining rigs in a special dielectric liquid. This fluid absorbs heat more efficiently, keeping equipment cooler and operating at peak performance.

This advanced approach offers several benefits:

Hashrate measures how much computing power miners use to validate Bitcoin transactions and secure the blockchain. It's a key indicator of network strength and miner confidence.

Here's a breakdown:

Currently, the global bitcoin network runs at over 865 exahashes per second (EH/s)—one of the highest levels in history.

This technology is especially relevant as AI, data centers, and crypto mining all demand more power and generate more heat. As air cooling reaches its limits, immersion cooling positions BitMine as a leader in next-generation infrastructure.

BitMine Immersion Technologies is also serious about protecting the environment. The company's immersion cooling systems drastically cut energy consumption and reduce environmental impact. This shows they are investing capital in infrastructure upgrades aimed at cutting emissions and maximizing operational efficiency.

Research from the Bitcoin Policy Institute (BPI) highlights how bitcoin mining increasingly relies on renewable energy, turning surplus energy into a valuable resource. Using excess power from renewable sources like wind and solar helps stabilize grids and reduce energy waste, proving that it can contribute to carbon reduction rather than exacerbating emissions.



Immersion cooling is widely recognized as a greener alternative to traditional air cooling. This technique involves submerging mining hardware in a non-conductive dielectric fluid that quickly absorbs and dissipates heat. Thereby offering several sustainability advantages.

BitMine Immersion Technologies is showing how high-performance mining can also be environmentally responsible. With an initial hosting capacity of 50 megawatts, the company is rapidly expanding across North America and the Caribbean, without losing sight of its commitment to sustainability.

It runs on a smart, dual-income model that supports both resilience and expansion. Key highlights of its portfolio are:

This approach gives Bitmine steady revenue, lowers risk, and allows it to adjust quickly to shifts in the crypto market. By partnering with leading ASIC equipment providers and locking in service contracts, the company ensures consistent payouts and flexibility.

Investors have taken notice of BMNR stock's momentum:

Jonathan Bates, CEO of BitMine, said in the press release that,

“The private placement will accelerate BitMine's treasury holdings shortly after its first treasury purchase on June 9, 2025. FalconX, Kraken, and Galaxy Digital plan to partner with the Company to grow a world-class Ethereum treasury strategy alongside existing custody partners, BitGo and Fidelity Digital.”

BitMine has grown rapidly, outpacing much of the market:

However, it still presents a high-risk investment profile. The company is not yet profitable, with a net income margin of -77.8%, as it continues to prioritize rapid growth and infrastructure expansion over short-term earnings.

According to experts, its valuation is also on the higher side, trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 14.4, well above the S&P 500 average of 3.1. This indicates strong investor expectations for future growth. Additionally, BMNR stock remains highly volatile, experiencing sharp fluctuations in price in recent months.

BitMine runs a lean team of just seven employees. As said before, it leases its mining equipment to enable fast scaling based on market demand. Strategic partnerships with ASIC brokers and service providers give it access to the latest technology and support steady revenue growth.

With new funding secured, BitMine is gearing up to expand its hosting capacity well beyond the current 50 megawatts. The company also plans to deploy advanced cybersecurity systems and smart management tools.

It is actively working on launching additional facilities across North America and the Caribbean, adding hundreds of megawatts in capacity. At the same time, the company is focused on setting new industry benchmarks through its sustainable immersion-cooled mining systems.

These initiatives emerge at a time when ESG standards are gaining increasing importance to investors and regulators alike. As the push for cleaner blockchain practices continues, its unique model may well shape the future of green digital asset mining.

 Vietnam is leveraging crypto regulation to meet FATF standards, combat digital asset fraud and rebuild its international financial reputation. 

On June 14, 2025, Vietnam's National Assembly approved the Law on Digital Technology Industry, effective Jan. 1, 2026.

Vietnam's crypto regulation is part of a broader effort to meet FATF standards after being gray-listed in 2023 due to AML/CFT deficiencies.

The law distinguishes between crypto assets (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether) and virtual assets (non-financial digital items), excluding CBDCs and securities.

The law mandates identity checks, transaction monitoring and reporting obligations to detect and prevent digital asset fraud, addressing enforcement gaps.

On June 14, 2025, Vietnam's National Assembly passed the Law on Digital Technology Industry, signaling a significant shift in how the country manages digital assets. Effective Jan. 1, 2026, this law introduces clear regulations for Vietnam's fast-growing cryptocurrency sector. It represents a broader attempt by Vietnam to improve its financial reputation and exit the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) gray list. 

With this law, Vietnam has implemented a comprehensive legal framework for digital assets. This includes classifying digital assets, licensing requirements and robust compliance mechanisms aligned with international standards. By regulating its crypto sector, Vietnam aims to address FATF concerns, boost investor confidence and position itself as a digital economy hub in Southeast Asia. 

This article explores how crypto reform supports Vietnam's FATF comeback strategy. It digs into Vietnamese crypto law and explains how it addresses the FATF's concerns.

Founded in 1989 by the G7, or the Group of Seven, the FATF is a global organization that establishes standards to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing and other threats to the financial system. The FATF creates policies and oversees their adoption in member countries. The G7 is an intergovernmental organization comprising seven leading advanced economies: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US. 

The FATF provides recommendations to shape national laws and assesses compliance through peer reviews. Countries that do not meet FATF standards may be placed on a “gray list” or “blacklist,” which can harm their global financial reputation and investment environment.

Did you know? By complying with FATF rules, Vietnam hopes to attract global VCs and crypto exchanges, turning regulatory clarity into an economic development tool. 

In June 2023, Vietnam was placed on the FATF gray list, officially termed “jurisdictions under increased monitoring,” after agreeing to address significant deficiencies in its Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) measures. 

The FATF cited issues such as inadequate supervision of financial institutions, weak Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and insufficient regulation of virtual asset service providers. It also raised concerns about Vietnam's efforts to combat illicit financing tied to weapons proliferation. 

To be removed from the gray list, Vietnam must fully implement an FATF action plan. This includes strengthening AML laws, improving regulatory oversight, enhancing CDD and ensuring effective prosecution of financial crimes. 

The FATF monitors progress through updates and on-site visits. Once compliance is demonstrated, member states vote in a plenary session to decide on removal, signaling renewed trust in the country's financial integrity. 

Vietnam became the world's first country to pass a standalone law dedicated to the digital technology industry. The law was passed in June 2025; implementation begins in January 2026.

Here are the key highlights of Vietnam's Law on Digital Technology Industry (Digital Technology Law):

Ambitious growth: Aims to create 150,000 digital tech firms by 2035 under the “Make in Vietnam” initiative.

Defined categories: The law separates crypto assets (like Bitcoin, Ether) from virtual assets (non-financial digital items), enabling more precise risk-based regulation per FATF guidance.

Strong incentives: Offers tax breaks, grants and import duty exemptions for startups, SMEs, and foreign tech investors.

Workforce support: Vietnamese digital experts get five years of tax exemption; foreign experts receive five-year visas and no work permit requirement.

AI and digital asset regulation: Introduces a risk-based AI framework and legal rules for crypto and virtual assets.

Regulatory sandbox: Allows controlled testing of blockchain, DeFi and virtual asset technologies to foster innovation.

The law divides digital assets into two categories: 

Virtual assets: Non-financial digital items used for exchange or investment. These exclude securities, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), fiat currencies and traditional financial instruments. 

Crypto assets: Digital assets that use encryption or blockchain technologies to manage issuance, transfer and storage. Like virtual assets, they do not include securities or CBDCs. 

This classification of digital assets facilitates a structured legal framework that enables regulated use of these assets while differentiating these categories from mainstream financial products. It tasks the government with licensing, oversight and operational guidelines for each category, signaling a move toward transparency and compliance.

The law excludes securities, CBDCs, and traditional financial instruments from these categories.

Key changes for crypto startups include legal recognition, a framework for regulation and tax incentives. The law also includes provisions for pilot sandbox mechanisms for virtual asset products and services. Tax exemptions, subsidies and workforce training programs are available for blockchain startups.

Did you know? Vietnam's crypto law allows authorities to collaborate internationally on digital asset fraud, improving cross-border investigations and curbing global crypto crime.

More than just a domestic milestone, Vietnam's Law on the Digital Technology Industry represents a critical step toward aligning Vietnam's digital asset sector with FATF standards on AML and Countering the Financing of Terrorism.

Key highlights include:

Crypto officially legalized: Vietnam's 2025 law ends legal ambiguity by recognizing crypto ownership and use, aligning with FATF's push for clear national regulation of digital assets.

Defined categories: The law separates crypto assets (like Bitcoin, Ether) from virtual assets (non-financial digital items), enabling more precise risk-based regulation per FATF guidance.

AML and CFT integration: Crypto exchanges and wallet providers will fall under state supervision, helping Vietnam address FATF concerns about weak customer due diligence and illicit finance.

Stablecoins excluded: Fiat-backed stablecoins are regulated separately under financial laws, ensuring consistent oversight and reducing systemic risk in line with FATF's risk-based approach.

Regulatory clarity for businesses: Clear rules attract crypto startups and help formalize the sector, making it easier to monitor transactions, enforce KYC and reduce capital flight.

These reforms directly support Vietnam's goal of exiting the FATF gray list by establishing a transparent, controlled crypto environment that is compliant with global standards.

The legislation also empowers the government to define licensing rules, asset classification and oversight mechanisms, ensuring crypto service providers and financial institutions operate within a regulated environment. 

Through these measures, Vietnam signals its commitment to meeting FATF standards and regaining international trust in its financial ecosystem. 

The law provides Vietnamese authorities with a clear legal framework to investigate, prosecute and deter digital asset fraud. Previously, the absence of legal tools hampered enforcement efforts. The law introduces compliance obligations such as identity checks, transaction monitoring and reporting duties. 

Two recent fraud cases highlight the urgency of these reforms: 

In February 2025, authorities arrested four individuals behind BitMiner, a fake crypto mining scheme that defrauded 200 victims of over 4 billion Vietnamese dong (~$157,300). 

In December 2024, the Hanoi police disrupted a scam involving Million Smiles, which used deceptive ads to promote a cryptocurrency called QFS, resulting in losses of about $1.17 million. 

The law passed by Vietnam's National Assembly includes AML and CFT measures, requiring crypto service providers to implement compliance procedures such as identity checks, transaction monitoring and reporting obligations.

Provisions of the law facilitate greater cooperation with international regulators. Vietnam facilitates collaboration with foreign authorities on cross-border investigations by aligning its crypto regulations with global standards. 

This law is particularly important for addressing transnational crypto crimes, where assets and suspects often cross jurisdictions. By addressing legal gaps and enhancing regulatory coordination, Vietnam has bolstered its national enforcement efforts and reputation in the global financial community.

Did you know? Being on the FATF gray list doesn't just hurt reputation; it can make foreign banks hesitant to work with domestic institutions, limiting capital flow and investments.

Vietnam's new crypto law is part of its ambition to become a digital technology hub in Southeast Asia. By formally recognizing crypto assets, the government welcomes innovation and attracts global startups and investors. 

The law offers significant incentives for tech companies, including: 

Tax reductions for blockchain, AI and chip design firms. 

Subsidized access to digital campuses and innovation parks. 

Grants and infrastructure support for R&D in semiconductors and cloud technology. 

To support this ecosystem, the government is also investing in digital education through vocational programs, university-industry collaboration and tech apprenticeships, ensuring a skilled workforce for the future. 

These combined efforts aim to establish Vietnam as a regional leader in digital innovation. 

Vietnam's cryptocurrency law is central to its FATF compliance strategy. By defining virtual and crypto assets and enforcing rules on licensing, AML/KYC, cybersecurity and transaction oversight, the country has aligned itself with FATF Recommendation 15, one of the key issues cited during its gray listing. 

In parallel, the State Bank of Vietnam has tightened AML rules, updated risk assessments, standardized reporting practices, and strengthened CDD under revised Circular 09. If fully implemented by January 2026, these reforms could pave the way for Vietnam's removal from the gray list. 

A clear regulatory environment also enhances investor confidence. Legalized exchange operations and strong compliance standards reassure international crypto businesses, venture capitalists and tech firms. Moreover, seamless integration between crypto and traditional banking improves access to capital markets and institutional finance. 

Ultimately, Vietnam's crypto regulation not only addresses FATF concerns but also enhances its global image as a transparent and innovation-friendly economy.

Crypto-focused prediction market Polymarket is facing a fresh dose of criticism this week in relation to a market on whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would wear a suit before July.

More than $160 million worth of crypto was bet on the market, with the initial outcome of ""yes"" being disputed by the validators behind UMA, the oracle protocol that determines the results.

The price of ""yes"" has now plummeted to $0.04 from $0.19, giving an implied probability of outcome at just 4%. The ""yes"" voters are striking back, claiming that Zelenskyy did indeed wear a suit at the NATO summit on June 24 and that there could be foul play by UMA validators to swing the decision. 

The validators are holders of UMA protocol tokens, who get to vote on the veracity of the real-world data that's encoded in the protocol's oracle. In theory, a large-enough swathe of token-holders could manipulate a result to their own choosing.

This is not the first time there has been a divide between Polymarket and UMA communities. In March another Ukrainian-themed market was disputed amid claims of manipulation from large holders of UMA.

""We all know the whales are trying to rig the UMA vote on the Zelensky suit market,"" X user Atlantislq wrote. ""But that doesn't mean we should stay silent. This is a critical moment Polymarket claims to care about truth and decentralization so let's hold them to it.""

AI chat bot Grok took the side of ""yes"" voters, saying that ""Zelenskyy wore a suit in June 2025.""

On the other side, popular menswear influencer and writer who goes by the moniker ""derek guy"" bet $3.6 million on the market resolving as ""no."" He stands to make $72,000 if the bet is successful.

A final resolution on the market will be made at 00:00 UTC on July 8.

Bitcoin's BTC$108,023.58 very modest weekend rally modestly reversed on Monday as President Trump's tariff policies took center stage again.

The largest cryptocurrency slipped below $108,000 during the U.S. afternoon, down 0.8% over the past 24 hours. Changing hands at around $107,700, BTC has round-tripped all of the move to $109,700 on Sunday.

Ethereum's ether ETH$2,541.53 was 0.6% lower, while smaller cryptos including Solana's SOL SOL$148.59, dogecoin DOGE$0.1676, Sui's SUI SUI$2.8637 declined 1%-2%. XRP XRP$2.2912 outperformed with more than a 2% gain.

Dampening investor sentiment was the President Trump ramping up tariffs even while delaying his self-imposed July 9 trade deal deadline to August 1.

In letters from the White House to counterparts in Japan and South Korea, Trump set 25% tariffs on products from those two countries starting on August 1. Trump shared more letters on Truth Social, revealing a 25% levies against Kazakhstan and Malaysia, 30% against South Africa, and 40% for Myanmar and Laos.

In a Monday social post, Trump also threatened additional tariffs on countries aligning with policies by the BRICS, a loose intergovernmental group of countries including Brazil, India, China and Russia.

In a press conference, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the government will send out letters to more countries about tariff rates or announce trade deals in the coming days.

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes were lower by about 1% on Monday, while yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds also headed higher, nearing 4.4%.

UPDATE (July 7, 18:43 UTC): Adds tariffs against Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Laos, Myanmar and South Africa.

 Michael Saylor's Strategy skipped weekly Bitcoin buys for the first time since April, announcing a new $4.2 billion stock sale and reporting $14 billion in unrealized gains in Q2. 

Michael Saylor's Strategy, the world's largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, reported $14 billion in unrealized gains on its holdings in the second quarter of 2025.

The company recorded an unrealized gain on its digital asset holdings of $14.05 billion, along with a deferred tax expense of $4.04 billion, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday

“As of June 30, 2025, the Company's digital asset carrying value was $64.36 billion, with a related deferred tax liability of $6.31 billion,” the filing stated.

Despite the gains, Strategy paused its Bitcoin buying spree last week, with the company's BTC holdings remaining at 597,325 BTC following its recent 4,980 BTC purchase.

Strategy's decision to skip buying Bitcoin came as prices fell to $105,400 last Tuesday, before briefly surging above $110,000 on Thursday, according to CoinGecko data.

The pause marked the first time since April that Strategy skipped a weekly Bitcoin purchase. The company previously paused acquisitions when Bitcoin fell below $87,000.

Following the previous pause, Strategy resumed with a 3,459 BTC purchase announced on April 14, two weeks after the previous buy of 22,048 BTC on March 31.

The newly released official Strategy figures are slightly above the estimations by Bloomberg analysts, who last week projected the company to report at least $13 billion in unrealized gains for 2Q 2025.

In addition to releasing the second quarter results, Strategy also announced its latest $4.2 billion at-the-marketing (ATM) offering on Monday.

The company has entered into a sales agreement under which Strategy may issue and sell shares of its 10% Series A perpetual Stride (STRD) preferred stock at the price of $0.001 per share.

Similar to other Strategy offerings, including the $21 billion STRK ATM, the new ATM program is an equity-raising mechanism designed to allow the company to gradually sell newly issued shares to buy more Bitcoin.

According to an investor presentation accompanying the new $4.2 billion STRD ATM announcement, Strategy has so far issued $477 million STRK and $163 million STRF ATMs.

The total remaining ATM capacity across the programs is $44.8 billion, including $18.1 billion for MSTR, $4.2 billion for STRD, $20.5 billion for STRK and $1.9 billion for STRF, Strategy reported.

This Astronaut's Space Photography Puts Fireworks to Shame

We spoke with NASA astronaut Matthew Dominick in an exclusive, first-ever interview from the cupola of the International Space Station.

By Rachel Feltman, Kelso Harper, Fonda Mwangi & Jeffery DelViscio 

Kelso Harper/Scientific American

NASA: Scientific American, this is Mission Control, Houston.

Rachel Feltman: Station, this is Scientific American. How do you hear me?

Matthew Dominick: Loud and clear. Welcome to the cupola on the space station.

Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. For the next few days we're doing something a little different. We're going to use this week to share reruns of three of our favorite episodes from the past year. First up we've got a chat with a guy who just needs a little space.

Back in September we rang up the International Space Station for a live video convo with Matthew Dominick. At the time he was serving as the commander and flight engineer of NASA's SpaceX Crew-8 mission—and spent a lot of his downtime taking and sharing stunning photos, videos and time-lapses from orbit. In fact, his video call with Science Quickly marked the first ever interview from the cupola.

If you wanna see the video—which, trust me, you definitely do—check out our show notes for a link to the whole interview on YouTube.

Matt, thanks so much for taking the time to chat with me today.

Dominick: So excited to do so.

Feltman: Yeah, so where exactly are you, are you calling in from? Because I understand it's a, a pretty big deal—and not just because you're in space right now.

Dominick: Awesome. We're trying out something new today. We're on the International Space Station, of course, but we're in the cupola, which is one of the astronauts' favorite places and—to hang out. It's a seven-windowed environment on the bottom of the space station, so when you see us, you know, we kind of look upside down relative to Earth. But that's how we come in: our head is going down towards the Earth, and we get to look out and see our beautiful Earth through these seven windows. In the view right now you're seeing four of those windows. And as we go through this conversation, we get to see a dynamic event, which is sunset.

So I could take days and days to describe it, but—which is one of the reasons that drives me to do so much photography, 'cause—to just try and capture what we see. But super excited to come to you from the cupola today.

Feltman: Awesome, yeah, and I understand it took some, like, special equipment, some new window filters to make this possible. Could you tell me more about why that is?

Dominick: Oh, absolutely. It's incredibly bright—in fact, right now as we're going through sunset, if you're watching on video, the sun is coming up on the right-hand side of my face. It's really bright as we're getting close to sunset, and the—through the course of our conversation today, we'll go from, you know, a full day to full night. And we'll see the darkness—the “terminator,” we call it; the day-night transition—come over the top of me, and so I'm gonna just close [laughs] one of our shutters right now to protect the right side of my face from the searing sun and turn on a light.

But the cupola is really bright, and we, we recently got something shipped up to us called neutral-density filters, and [they're] these little films that we put over the windows—for photography nerds these are four stops. So these are—these provide four stops of, of exposure change that we're able to put in front of the windows to help expose—for pictures, if we want to take a picture of something both inside the cupola but also be able to see the Earth on the outside. So we're trying that out today.

Feltman: Very cool. Now speaking of photography nerds, you're an engineer, a pilot and of course, an astronaut, but you're also a prolific photographer. So how did you get into photography?

Dominick: So many paths led to that. I mean, to start when I was young, my dad was a photographer and a journalist and producer-director for, for local stuff growing up in Colorado. He actually started doing that in the Air Force—he was a photographer, ran a motion picture unit for the United States Air Force. And just seeing how he took photographs and, and how he composed things and, and cropped things and set up shots—I didn't do a lot of it growing up, but I was around it.

And then joining NASA, we got, we got trained by our, our photo/TV department how to take pictures, and then there's some very distinct moments I remember as part of my spaceflight—now we've been up here for five or six months ago—but things that really stick in my mind: you know, obviously the rocket lifting you off the launchpad, but that first time floating out of your seat and going to the window, I immediately wanted to just spend [laughs] so much time trying to capture what I saw with my eye with a camera.

I feel immense responsibility to share what we see. So few people are lucky enough to come up into space, I feel an immense obligation to take pictures and share everything we see with the world. And with the tools we have, the cameras we have up here, doing my absolute best to try and share what we see with the world.

Feltman: And how different is it taking photos in space versus on Earth?

Dominick: Oh, man, there are good parts, and there are hard parts. The dynamic component of the lighting is really a challenge. But you're also lucky that, you know, we—in photography they talk about the golden hour, or right there at, at sunrise or sunset. Folks like to take a lot of pictures at those times; the lighting is just incredible. And we're lucky to get 16 of those a day. We're going [about] 17,500 miles an hour. We're making a lap around the Earth every 90 minutes. So if I don't get the lighting right or the setup right on a pass, I can wait 90 minutes, and I'll get a chance to do it again. In fact, we're going through it right now—right above the top of my head, it's getting dark very quickly. The sun is searing out the right side of this hatch.

But shooting in space can also be a challenge because you're shooting through windows. And so you have to manage a lot of odd reflections, and so we have shrouds that we put up around the cameras to kind of block out interior lights from reflections. Shooting through the glass can be troublesome.

You know, and you have to shoot really fast shutter speeds sometimes just because we're going so fast. Folks who do astrophotography on Earth might be able to expose 10, 15 seconds without seeing star trails, depending on what lenses they're using. Up here, you know, I was [taking] pictures the other day; in a half-second exposure I was seeing streaks in city lights.

So it presents some unique challenges, but we have great instructors that teach us how to do it, and it's a lot of fun.

Feltman: Very cool. Do you use any special equipment?

Dominick: So much—so many cool toys. I'm a giant nerd. I'm willing to admit it ...

Feltman: [Laughs]

Dominick: We recently, you know, we—[laughs] I'm totally willing to admit it.

We have, you know, these big full-frame mirrorless cameras. This is an 85mm lens, super-fast lens: 1.4. That's super fun.

You know, we have cameras that are great for taking pictures of the Earth during the daytime. This is one of those. This is a 50-500 zoom lens. Love using this guy for daytime photography—super versatile.

We got a new lens, and so I've been posting a lot of images online with this lens. It's a 15mm lens that's super fast. It doesn't use f-stops, it uses T-stops, but it's about an f/1.2 or 1.4, and it's a T1.8. Love this thing. This has yielded so many incredible photographs.

So lots of great equipment up here and lots of practice. And luckily it's not analog anymore, so you can shoot a lot and not feel too bad about wasting film.

Feltman: Totally. So I know there are, like, pretty strict rules about how much weight an astronaut can bring up into space. Did you have to make any tough decisions about what equipment to bring with you?

Dominick: Luckily all the photo/TV equipment is provided through, through the International Space Station. That's up here already. We don't bring our own equipment. It's all up here already, and we share it and pass it around, and, you know, it's a blast. We have an incredible set of equipment. In fact, these—we get new equipment all the time. This lens just came up maybe a month ago and a couple other lenses and so absolutely loving it.

Feltman: Tell me more about training that you got specifically for space photography. You know, what kinds of new skills did you need to learn? What is—what does NASA want astronauts to know about taking photos in space?

Dominick: I think the key to taking photos in space, or anywhere for that matter, is understanding the basics, right: how aperture, exposure, ISO and—how they all play together and how you trade those three. Because you never really quite know the exact situation you're gonna be in. NASA does a great job developing procedures for specific situations, but once you get in that lighting situation, you know, you gotta really understand how to manipulate those on the camera, what lens you're using to mix them together to get what you want.

We do, you know, some artistic photography up here. I really like to take pictures of space station structure with the Earth in the background, the curvature of the Earth. In fact, watching right now, you're watching the sunset, which is amazing, right behind me. And this is a really dynamic event. You can see the darkness of night coming and taking over the day of the Earth. It's a really dynamic event. A sunset on Earth, you might have minutes. Here, you know, you have very little time to capture a sunset because you're going so fast. But NASA trains us those basics, and from those basics you can expand as far as you wanna go.

They also teach us technical photography. We are up here conducting research in science. And so sometimes you have to take technical photographs to show the researchers on Earth what you're doing or what their—the result of their experiment. So we do a lot of macrophotography; we get in close. And we have a whole set of lenses and lights to take pictures both inside the space station and outside the space station.

Feltman: What are some of your favorite things to photograph from the ISS?

Dominick: I think my favorite thing is the thing I'm not expecting. The things that I do expect to see or hope to see a lot of is aurora. I love seeing lights from Earth reflected off station structure. I took a picture really recently that I absolutely love where aurora and city lights are reflecting off the blue solar arrays that are on the service module. I just love those reflections, the interaction of Earth lights reflecting off of station structure.

But some of my favorite pictures are the ones I don't expect. I was in here with my crewmate Mike a couple weeks ago, and I don't remember what we were shooting. We were shooting something else, and all of a sudden I saw the moon getting ready to set. And I quickly grabbed a different camera, swapped the lenses, put the settings in and was shooting over Mike's shoulder and ended up getting a great exposure of, of the moon setting on the Earth and just loved it. And so the unexpected are some of my favorite shots.

Feltman: Do you have a favorite photograph or time-lapse in particular from your time on ISS?

Dominick: I think I'm gonna suffer from recency bias there. I have a lot of pictures. I do like to take a lot of candid pictures inside the space station of crewmates at work or, or catch them when they're having fun. But external photographs, I probably suffer from recency bias here. Just set up a time-lapse the other day, shooting one of my favorite things, which is Southeast Asia fishing boats. Actually, no, it wasn't that picture, sorry [laughs]. Shooting the Nile River. There's too many things to be excited about.

I love shooting the Nile River at night or coming over Europe and seeing the Mediterranean and the Nile River. And we were coming up over Africa with lightning, and I love taking pictures of lightning. And we come up over the Nile River, and then we go over Israel—and it was a time-lapse. I was trying a new technique. I was trying to, you know, really crank the gain up and see what would happen with ISO and went to review the pictures later over the dinner table on the camera, and I was just blown away because I caught a meteor, a massive meteor, coming into the atmosphere out of just sheer luck and exploding in the atmosphere, and it just emits this giant green glow that was multiple sizes times bigger than Israel. And it was just an incredible, just lucky shot. So it's always something new.

Feltman: What are you hoping that people think or feel when they see your images?

Dominick: I feel like people are interested in what you're doing when you're interested in it and when you're talking about it and sharing it. And I just wanna share what we see. I feel this immense obligation to share what we're seeing up here in space. I'm super lucky to be here. Not a lot of people get to come up here, and I just wanna share with the world what humanity can do when they come together to do something. So many nations worked together to put together this International Space Station across seemingly impossible boundaries across nations, and look what we get to do and we get to see outside the window.

And from the moment I first looked out the window, I wanted to try and capture what my eyeball sees, and I've yet to completely do it with the camera. It's very difficult. The human eye is really—can show such a deep dynamic range that I haven't been able to capture quite yet with the camera.

But I want people to think whatever they wanna think. I just wanna share what I see.

Feltman: Yeah. So you're coming to the end of your mission on ISS. What's something that you're really gonna miss when you're back on Earth?

Dominick: So many things. I enjoy the short commute. I can wake up a couple minutes before the start of the day and be out of my crew quarters and at work in just a couple minutes [laughs]. And I get to float to work, which is super awesome. I love flipping. Why would you float straight when you can flip the whole time? So I spend a lot of time flipping everywhere on the space station. I'm gonna miss that immensely. I'm gonna miss having all of these cameras in my fingertips. It's amazing—I've got five or six cameras in my fingertips that I can choose from to take a shot.

There, there's a lot of aspects of space I'm gonna miss. I—it's tough to nail one individual thing down.

Feltman: What are you looking forward to back on Earth?

Dominick: [Laughs] I mean, obviously I want to go be at home for a little bit of time with my wife and daughters. I would like to take a shower; I haven't taken a shower since March. I'm part of a research experiment where I don't

use the treadmill up here, so I haven't walked since March. I'd like to walk maybe once or twice [laughs] or maybe a lot.

But there's so many things. But I love, I love both places: I love the space station, and I love being on Earth. The Earth—when you look out these windows and you look at Earth, it just blows you away with its beauty.

Feltman: Wow. I'd love to hear more about that research project. So how many months has it been since you walked again?

Dominick: So as part of the research project, the last time I walked was when I walked into the spacecraft, the Dragon, in March. There's a treadmill up here that we use for working out, but I volunteered for a research program where I don't use the treadmill. I use our, our resistance device, our training device, and a bicycle. The reason being is a treadmill takes up a lot of space and a lot of mass that could be difficult on long-duration missions to the moon or to Mars. And so we wanna see what happens to the human body if you aren't exposed to that ambulation.

Oh, by the way, the lighting is amazing right now. We're just now going through sunset here. And one of my favorite things to watch is the lighting on people's faces, so I've turned off the internal lights in here so you can just watch the lighting on someone's face during a sunset. I love watching it on my crewmates' faces.

Feltman: Wow, very cool. So what do you think you're gonna photograph when you're back on Earth, you know, now that you've experienced space photography from space?

Dominick: Well, NASA does this really cool thing to help us get better at photography and taking quick pictures, and that is: they let us borrow the cameras. And so I practice taking pictures of things that don't sit still, like my kids—oh, or other sporting events or those kinds of things that can be tricky. Those are kind of fun. Or just work at NASA or those kinds of things to keep your practice up. But there's so many beautiful things to take pictures on Earth, just as there are in space.

Feltman: And other than photography, what's your favorite thing to do on ISS?

Dominick: Favorite thing to do? I mean, other than photography—you're, you're asking me tough questions here, to rank and stack things.

I really, like I said before, I love flipping and floating through the lab. I love playing in zero-g and just seeing how things react. And I don't need a lot to entertain me. A stick and some mud works on Earth sometimes. But one time I was up here just playing with a bolt and a nut and see how they spin and work together and see if you can catch the two. And it's just so much fun to play in zero-g—or play with water. Every time I talk with one of my daughters on video chat, she's always saying, “Hey, Dad, do the water thing.” And we make big bubbles of water and play with them. And we don't just do those things when we're doing [Public Affairs Office] events; we do those things for fun 'cause it's so much fun to play with.

Feltman: My last question is just: Is there anything you haven't gotten to photograph on ISS yet that you're hoping to catch while you're up there?

Dominick: I'm planning to take some videos of just some basic physics things inside the space station that you can only do up here in zero-g. I'm thinking about how we're gonna do propellant transfer from one rocket to another, and I've been thinking about how you, you know, that's really important for the future of spaceflight right now. Rockets launch, and they use all their fuel, and they—you don't refuel in space as much. And we do have some small cases—in fact, the space station does on-orbit refueling—but refueling on large scales, and I've been t

hinking about how you move fluids around. So making videos of how fluids move around in zero-g, among other things. I'm looking forward to making a lot of videos, to be honest.

Feltman: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for taking the time to chat today and for, you know, pushing to help us see this space live. It's such a cool view, so I know I really appreciate it, and I'm sure everybody else watching does, too.

Dominick: Awesome. Thank you so much. I'm, I'm super glad to share with you—you know, we started in the daytime. We went through this entire interview in the sunset, dynamic changes, and I think that really shows just kind of the environment we live in.

And, you know, 30 minutes from now the sun's gonna be rising again, and we're gonna be in another sunrise. And it's super fun to be a part of and thankful that you would join us today.

Massive Study Flips Our Story of Addiction and the Brain

Brain differences in children and teens who experiment with drugs early show up before they take their first puff or sip

By Maia Szalavitz edited by Allison Parshall

For decades, Americans have been told a simple story about addiction: taking drugs damages the brain—and the earlier in life children start using substances, the more likely they are to progress through a “gateway” from milder ones such as marijuana to more dangerous drugs such as opioids. Indeed, those who start using at younger ages are much more likely to become addicted.

But a recent study, part of an ongoing project to scan the brains of 10,000 kids as they move through childhood into adulthood, complicates the picture. It found that the brains of those who started experimenting with cannabis, cigarettes or alcohol before age 15 showed differences from those who did not—before the individuals took their first puff or sip. When paired with an independent trial of a successful prevention program tailored to at-risk kids, the findings suggest better ways to fend off substance use disorders before they start.

“This study is extremely helpful because it begins to outline the brain changes that are seen in teenagers who start to use drugs early,” says Ayana Jordan, an associate professor of psychiatry and population health at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, who was not associated with the project.

The findings are “actually telling you that there are vulnerability factors and identifying them,” says Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), part of the National Institutes of Health, which funded the research. Published in December 2024 in JAMA Network Open, the new work is part of the ongoing NIDA-led Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development initiative, the largest-ever long-term U.S. study of child brain health and growth. (Like all current NIH projects, it is threatened by the budget cuts imposed by the Trump administration, though Volkow says sustaining it is a top priority for NIDA.) In the new study, children aged nine to 11 underwent regular brain scans for three years. In separate interviews, the participants and their parents also provided information on diet and substance use. Nearly a quarter of the children had used drugs including alcohol, cannabis and nicotine before the study began.

Children who started using drugs during the study period had preexisting enlargements in many brain regions and had larger brains overall when the study began than those who did not use drugs, explains lead author Alex Miller, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Indiana University School of Medicine. These youth had many of the same brain differences as children who had begun drug use before the start of the study. In both groups, the outer portion of the brain, called the cortex, also had a larger surface area on average, with more folds and grooves.

Having a bulkier and more heavily creased brain is generally linked to higher intelligence, though these factors are far from the only ones that matter. Bigger and groovier isn't always better: during adolescence, natural processes actually “prune back” some brain areas—so whether size differences are positive depends on the life stage being studied and on the brain regions that should be large at that time.

Other research has associated the some of the brain differences found in the study with certain personality traits: curiosity, or interest in exploring the environment, and a penchant for risk-taking.

Like having a large brain, curiosity and interest in novelty (which are sometimes measured together as a personality trait called “openness to experience”) are associated with intelligence. But when curiosity is coupled with a strong drive to seek intense sensations and a willingness to take risks without considering the consequences, it's also linked to a higher likelihood of trying drugs.

If these early brain differences aren't caused by drugs, where do they come from? They could reflect certain genetic variations or childhood exposure to adverse experiences—both of which have previously been associated with addiction risk. While it's still possible that substances could chemically interfere with brain development, contributing to the elevated risk for addiction among those who start drinking or taking other drugs early, the study suggests that there are other, preexisting factors at play.

The brain differences here were only linked to early initiation of drug use—not necessarily to addiction itself. “More data is needed to see if any of these brain changes are related to disease progression, severity of use or how the teens may respond to treatment,” Jordan says.

Research already suggests that early differences can be targeted to improve prevention programs. In fact, a recent trial showed that substance use disorders can be prevented in kids with personality traits that put them at higher risk. Some of the personality traits targeted in this trial have previously been associated with the kinds of brain differences found in the new brain scan study.

In the prevention trial, researchers compared Montreal-area schools in which teens received a personality-based intervention in seventh grade with those that did not. The program began by having kids take a validated personality test. Months later, with no reference to the test, teens who scored highest in the traits of impulsiveness, sensation-seeking, hopelessness or sensitivity to anxiety were invited to participate in two 90-minute workshops. These workshops taught cognitive skills aimed at maximizing the strengths and minimizing the weaknesses typically associated with their specific most strongly outlying trait.

Five years later, students at the schools that did use the program had 87 percent lower odds of developing substance use disorders. “It's a 35 percent reduction in the annual growth of substance use disorders across time,” says Patricia Conrod, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Montreal and lead author of the prevention trial. The results were published in the American Journal of Psychiatry in January.

Conrod emphasizes that “risky” traits have pluses as well as minuses. For example, a tendency to seek new experiences can be critical for success in science, medicine and the arts. A willingness to take risks is useful in occupations ranging from firefighting to entrepreneurship. The trick is to help young people manage such predilections safely.

In some children she has worked with, who start drugs as early as age 13, Conrod says that “the drive to self-medicate is so strong; it's really striking. There really is this discomfort with their inner world.” As a result, providing ways to manage these feelings without misusing drugs—and without pathologizing those with outlying traits—can be a powerful way to support healthy development.

The long-lost Wonder of the World was rediscovered underwater in 1968. Finally, some of its blocks have been raised to the surface.

This story is a collaboration with Biography.com

We might finally be able to understand the scale and scope of one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that had been lost to time for centuries.

La Brujula Verde reports that an endeavor called the “PHAROS” project has actually raised up from the seafloor twenty-two massive blocks that were once part of the eminent work of architecture known as the Lighthouse of Alexandria. Among the remnants recovered from the watery depths, which were rediscovered in 1968 and more thoroughly in the 1990s, were the lintels and uprights that were once part of the structure's staggering entrance.

The ultimate endgame of the “PHAROS” project, and why they raised these blocks? To fully reconstruct, to scale, the celebrated Lighthouse of Alexandria.

At least, reconstruct it in digital form.

The “PHAROS” project intends to create a 3D reconstruction of the lighthouse. “The objective is to create a digital twin of the Lighthouse of Alexandria, a virtual model offering the unique possibility of ‘visiting' it as if time had never passed,” La Brujula Verde notes, which will allow researchers to “test every possible hypothesis” about both how the tower was built, and how it ultimately fell apart.

The Lighthouse of Alexandria in Alexandria, Egypt, was actually one of the longest surviving of the Ancient Wonders. Constructed in the 200s B.C., sometime during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, it endured as an active lighthouse all the way up to 1303, when it was finally deactivated. More than a century later, in 1480, what pieces remained of the lighthouse were used to build the Citadel of Quitbay, which still stands in that spot today.

More than just an architectural marvel, the Lighthouse of Alexandria boasted a powerful guiding light for those approaching Egypt by sea. In the historian Josephus' first-century AD work The Jewish War, writing in the present tense, he noted that the lighthouse “affords the sight of a fire to such as sail within three hundred furlongs of it, that ships may cast anchor a great way off in the night time, by reason of the difficulty of sailing nearer.”

Due to its position and its powerful light, the structure alternatively known as the Pharos (hence the name of the aforementioned project) offered an important strategic advantage to whomever controlled it. This was a fact recognized by no less than Julius Caesar, who in his Civil Wars wrote that:

But while the qualities of the lighthouse were recorded in these ancient histories, many mysteries still remain. As La Brujula Verde notes, the “PHAROS” project hopes its reconstruction can elucidate much of what is still very muddled, including “its unique design, its innovative engineering, and, crucially, on the reasons that led to its final collapse after more than sixteen hundred years of defying time and the elements.”

But raising those blocks was only the the beginning. The report notes that the next phase of the project involves studying and 3D-scanning the raised blocks “which will join the hundreds of architectural elements that, over the past ten years, have already been meticulously digitized directly in their underwater environment by the teams from the Center for Alexandrian Studies (CEAlex), a permanent unit of the CNRS and the French Institute of Oriental Archaeology (IFAO) in Egypt, operating under the authority of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.”

From there, the responsibility will fall to a team of volunteers from the Dassault Systèmes Foundation. All the scans, all the studies, all of the data the project has gathered so far, notes La Brujula Verde, “will need to be analyzed with the utmost scientific rigor and virtually placed in its hypothetical original position within the now-vanished structure.”

But should the “PHAROS” project succeed, it will offer historians of the future to experience this Wonder of the World in a way those ancient writers centuries ago could never have imagined.

In June 2016, neurobiologist Catherina Becker witnessed at first hand how a contentious national issue could affect the members of her laboratory group. The United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union, triggering the process known as Brexit, was divisive. Becker, then director of the Centre for Neuroregeneration at the University of Edinburgh, UK, found herself navigating the fine line between acknowledging her group's distress at the vote's possible implications for their careers and families, and keeping the lab's day-to-day research on track.

Becker, who was very active in the anti-Brexit movement before the vote, admits to strong feelings when she learnt of the result. “I was a bit non-directorial,” Becker admits. “I may have cussed a bit.”

But she also had to acknowledge the issue in her group. “It did come up,” she says. “It is difficult to navigate, because you have to respect people's views. There were probably a couple of people who were pro-Brexit for various reasons. And you can't roll over them,” she says. “So, while I expressed my opinion, I offered solidarity with everyone, hopefully.”

Still, it was a struggle. “It was a rubbish year,” Becker says.

Ideally, research labs should be devoid of pressures from national politics or international conflict: places where students, researchers and technicians keep experiments running and discoveries flowing. Distressing events, however, can affect lab members more than a principal investigator (PI) might realize. In the past few years alone, the global community has had to contend with the fall of US protections for abortion, wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and the Trump administration's cuts to research funding — tied to climate, diversity, certain universities and the health of people from sexual and gender minorities (LGBTQ+) — to name just a few. Acknowledging the fears of students and staff member and communicating support are powerful leadership and management skills. By knowing how to navigate difficult conversations, PIs can help to ensure their groups feel safe, protected and supported during uncertain times.

Becker, who is now at the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, says it's important to allow lab members to express their feelings. “Acknowledge that something momentous has happened,” she says. “And just leave some breathing space and don't tell people what to feel.” That kind of empathy requires trust, Becker says. In Edinburgh, she established that culture through a Friday lab lunch. It included rollicking 45-minute discussions on topics such as ‘Who's eaten the most experimental animals?' — anything except the group's work.

Becker is one of several PIs around the world who spoke to Nature's Careers team about strategies for creating safe spaces to discuss world events. Some of these PIs have been recognized by Nature for outstanding mentorship through its annual award for mentoring in science (see go.nature.com/4zrmakc), now in its 20th year. They describe their best strategies for helping lab members to navigate contentious outside events (see ‘Five top tips for difficult group discussions'). Although their experiences might be specific to their location, a common theme emerged: that early-career researchers might feel concern and stress, and might need space and time to express their concerns safely in research environments that, historically, have not always prized personal openness or asking for help.

These PIs stress that maintaining trust is crucial so that, instead of ignoring the outside world, lab members feel they can speak up when struggling with troubling events.

1. Avoid the urge to ignore an unsettling incident in the news, says Peter Scontrino, an organizational psychologist in Seattle, Washington. Remember that the words a group leader says — or doesn't say — will affect lab members. Even if a contentious issue does not affect you personally, it could land very differently with lab members who have less power or experience.

2. Consider starting a group meeting with supportive words. Scontrino suggests something along the following lines: “I know everyone is probably feeling concerned by what's happening in the world. I'm feeling frustrated myself. I just want everyone to know that my door is open if you want to talk.”

3. Catherina Becker, a neurobiologist at the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, suggests taking a lab member whom you suspect might be struggling out for an off-campus coffee or tea. Let them know that you care, and that you're available if needed.

4. Offer continuous support during tumultuous times. Adesola Ogunniyi, a neurologist at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria, reassures his lab members that their research will not be hindered by outside events. “I tell them to come and see me so we can discuss it,” Ogunniyi says.

5. Exemplify resilience by investing in your own mental health and speaking openly about it to colleagues. This helps to build an atmosphere of trust and respect so that everyone, from undergraduates to staff scientists, knows that they are valued.

Adesola Ogunniyi, a neurologist at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria, recalls the Occupy Nigeria movement of January 2012. Sparked by government action that more than doubled the price of fuel, Occupy Nigeria led to nationwide protests including sit-down strikes, demonstrations and even attempts to disrupt the electricity grid. These actions presented a huge risk for biomedical labs that need a reliable power supply for freezers and equipment.

Now an emeritus professor, Ogunniyi, a winner of Nature's 2024 Mentoring in Science award, remembers how he guided his trainees when Occupy Nigeria, and similar protests and labour strikes since then, led to great uncertainty in the academic community.

“We had a lot of these incidents in which education was disrupted,” Ogunniyi says. “Sometimes, you didn't know when [the] academic year would end, and whether, especially if you had a grant, you would be able to carry out the research.”

“Such challenges can disturb people, both psychologically and in terms of productivity,” he observes. “Sometimes protesters could be quite militant, going from lab to lab, directing people to leave their offices,”

Ogunniyi's strategy during difficult times was twofold: to reassure lab members that “nothing lasts forever” and things would return to normal at some point, and to stress that they should continue their research, even if they had to work around the challenges presented by protesters' actions.

Ogunniyi told his group members to keep focused on their work, whether by planning its next phase or by looking at past results to identify aspects that needed improvement or required more experiments. That way, he says, “by the time things return back to normal, they are able to come back, make up for these deficits, and continue”.

Ogunniyi says that PIs must nurture the dialogue between mentor and trainees, allowing the trainee to formulate contingency plans during disruptive periods. By giving group members ownership of decision-making, he helps them to develop the leadership skills they will need to flourish in their scientific careers.

“It has to be a two-way affair,” Ogunniyi says of the partnership. It's not always the lab member asking what to do and the mentor giving them instructions, he notes. “It's a dialogue. It has to be a feedback process.”

“We must always look for opportunities for growth, so that if one door closes, another one will open” if we are paying attention, he says. “Political situations and socio-economic problems should not stop science.”

Andrew Prentice, a maternal and child nutrition researcher and another 2024 award winner, is mentoring his way through a more current international challenge. Prentice directs a group at the Keneba field station, a research and health-care clinic of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine's Medical Research Council Unit in Gambia. His team depends on research funding from various sources, including the UK National Institute for Health and Care Research.

Prentice's team is currently absorbing the impact of sudden cuts to science funding by the administration of US President Donald Trump. Perhaps surprisingly, these affect his funding for research in Gambia because the UK government is reallocating resources to places where US funding has been curtailed.

While keeping a positive outlook, Prentice is being pragmatic and is encouraging the members of his group to make contingency plans for their careers. It is a delicate balance.

“We can't just say to our group members, ‘Oh, don't worry, we'll be fine,'” Prentice says. “Our moral responsibility is to say, yes, I think you do need to look for other options” in case funding does not come through.

Prentice says his leadership approach was influenced by the relationship he had with his own mentor in Gambia, Roger Whitehead, a nutritionist who was based there between 1973 and 1998. Prentice recalls long walks on the salt flats near Keneba, on which he and Whitehead talked about their scientific endeavours.

Earlier this year, a PhD student in Prentice's group was unable to travel to Europe for his thesis defence when his family members' visa applications were refused — an unusual occurrence, which Prentice says was probably the result of new political pressures on immigration to European countries. In response, Prentice organized a virtual celebration for the student and his family: a show of solidarity in the face of outside events, as well as a gesture of empathy.

Prentice's advice to PI colleagues is to manage expectations with group members while encouraging them to look for potential solutions, but also to maintain a positive attitude, especially when talking to early-career researchers. “I think we must keep the faith,” Prentice says. “You've got to believe that things are going to get better. And we can find interim survival mechanisms to get us through to a better future.”

Block CEO and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey wrote in an X post on Sunday night that he spent his weekend creating an app called Bitchat (presumably a combination of the words “bit” and “chat,” and not the other combination of words that it looks like). 

Bitchat is a messaging app that operates through Bluetooth mesh networks, allowing users to send messages without Wi-Fi or cell reception. Because of Bluetooth's technical limitations, this kind of app generally only works at a range of around 100 meters, making it useful for situations like finding friends at a busy music festival where cell service is spotty. However, Dorsey claims that his app has an extended range, relaying messages through peers to extend up to 300 meters, or 984 feet.

One of the most popular Bluetooth messaging apps, Bridgefy, was notably used during pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, since its ability to function without the internet makes it harder for Chinese authorities to detect. Both Bridgefy and Bitchat say they are end-to-end encrypted.

Coincidentally, Bridgefy is funded in part by another Twitter co-founder, Biz Stone. But Dorsey's newfound foray into developing Bitchat makes sense, given his long-term interests in decentralizing tech — he is a massive proponent of Bitcoin, and he originally founded the project that would become Bluesky while he was CEO of Twitter. Dorsey is no longer affiliated with Bluesky as it operates now.

Dorsey opened Bitchat to beta testers via Apple's Testflight, but the test is now full after hitting its 10,000-user maximum. He said on X that the app is still under review before it will be released.

Waymo kicked off two “road trips” to Philadelphia and New York City on Monday, signaling the Alphabet-owned company's interest in expanding into Northeastern cities. 

Waymo's branded “road trips” don't necessarily signal a commercial launch anytime soon. Waymo has announced several other road trips this year, including to Houston, Orlando, Las Vegas, San Diego, and San Antonio. Typically, the trips involve sending a small fleet of human-driven vehicles equipped with Waymo's autonomous driving system to map out the new city. Then Waymo tests the vehicles autonomously, though still with a human behind the wheel, before taking any data and learnings back to its engineers to improve the AI driver's performance. 

In some cases, these road trips have led to commercial launches. In 2023, the company made a road trip to Santa Monica, a city in Los Angeles County. The company now operates a commercial service in Los Angeles, including Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, and Hollywood. 

For its Philadelphia trip, Waymo plans to place vehicles in the most complex parts of the city, including downtown and freeways, according to a spokesperson. She noted folks will see Waymo vehicles driving “at all hours throughout various Philadelphia neighborhoods, from North Central to Eastwick, University City, and as far east as the Delaware River.”

This city is a National Treasure. It's a city of love, where eagles fly with a gritty spirit and cheese that spreads and cheese that steaks. Our road trip continues to Philly next. https://t.co/96XzLSFV8O https://t.co/L4PkJySxO5 pic.twitter.com/G58dFGlSaa

In NYC, Waymo will drive its cars manually in Manhattan just north of Central Park down to The Battery and parts of Downtown Brooklyn. The company will also map parts of Jersey City and Hoboken in New Jersey.

Waymo applied last month for a permit to test its AVs in New York City with a human behind the wheel. The company has not yet received approval. 

This isn't the company's first time in the Big Apple. Waymo initially deployed a small fleet of vehicles in late 2021 to map parts of Manhattan and New Jersey. This past winter, Waymo took a road trip up to Buffalo to test self-driving in wintery conditions. 

Even if Waymo gets approved to test its vehicles autonomously in NYC with a specialist behind the wheel, it'll be a long road to commercial deployment. NYC's AV regulations don't currently allow operators to deploy self-driving vehicles with no human in the front seat — a law Waymo is currently advocating to change.

Waymo's continued testing across the country is anchored by the company's current commercial robotaxi services offered in Atlanta, Austin, the Bay Area, Los Angeles, and Phoenix. Waymo plans to launch in Miami this year and Washington D.C. in 2026.

Some tennis players are not happy with Wimbledon's new AI line judges, as reported by The Telegraph. 

This is the first year the prestigious tennis tournament, which is still ongoing, replaced human line judges, who determine if a ball is in or out, with an electronic line calling system (ELC). 

Numerous players criticized the AI technology, mostly for making incorrect calls, leading to them losing points. Notably, British tennis star Emma Raducanu called out the technology for missing a ball that her opponent hit out, but instead had to be played as if it were in. On a television replay, the ball indeed looked out, the Telegraph reported. 

Jack Draper, the British No. 1, also said he felt some line calls were wrong, saying he did not think the AI technology was “100 percent accurate.”

Player Ben Shelton had to speed up his match after being told that the new AI line system was about to stop working because of the dimming sunlight. Elsewhere, players said they couldn't hear the new automated speaker system, with one deaf player saying that without the human hand signals from the line judges, she was unable to tell when she won a point or not. 

The technology also met a blip at a key point during a match this weekend between British player Sonay Kartal and the Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, where a ball went out, but the technology failed to make the call. The umpire had to step in to stop the rally and told the players to replay the point because the ELC failed to track the point. Wimbledon later apologized, saying it was a “human error,” and that the technology was accidentally shut off during the match. It also adjusted the technology so that, ideally,  the mistake could not be repeated. 

Debbie Jevans, chair of the All England Club, the organization that hosts Wimbledon, hit back at Raducanu and Draper, saying, “When we did have linesmen, we were constantly asked why we didn't have electronic line calling because it's more accurate than the rest of the tour.” 

We've reached out to Wimbledon for comment. 

This is not the first time the AI technology has come under fire as tennis tournaments continue to either partially or fully adopt automated systems. Alexander Zverev, a German player, called out the same automated line judging technology back in April, posting a picture to Instagram showing where a ball called in was very much out. 

The critiques reveal the friction in completely replacing humans with AI, making the case for why a human-AI balance is perhaps necessary as more organizations adopt such technology. Just recently, the company Klarna said it was looking to hire human workers after previously making a push for automated jobs.

The data industry is on the verge of a drastic transformation.

The market is consolidating. And if the deal flow in the past two months is any indicator — with Databricks buying Neon for $1 billion and Salesforce snapping up cloud management firm Informatica for $8 billion — momentum is building for more.

The acquired companies may range in size, age, and focus area within the data stack, but they all have one thing in common. These companies are being bought in hopes the acquired technology will be the missing piece needed to get enterprises to adopt AI.

On the surface level, this strategy makes sense.

The success of AI companies, and AI applications, is determined by access to quality underlying data. Without it, there simply isn't value — a belief shared by enterprise VCs. In a TechCrunch survey conducted in December 2024, enterprise VCs said data quality was a key factor to make AI startups stand out and succeed. And while some of these companies involved in these deals aren't startups, the sentiment still stands.

Gaurav Dhillon — the co-founder and former CEO of Informatica and current chairman and CEO at data integration company SnapLogic — echoed this in a recent interview with TechCrunch.

“There is a complete reset in how data is managed and flows around the enterprise,” Dhillon said. “If people want to seize the AI imperative, they have to redo their data platforms in a very big way. And this is where I believe you're seeing all these data acquisitions, because this is the foundation to have a sound AI strategy.”

But is this strategy of snapping up companies built before a post-ChatGPT world the way to increase enterprise AI adoption in today's rapidly innovating market? That's unclear. Dhillon has doubts too.

“Nobody was born in AI; that's only three years old,” Dhillon said, referring to the current post-ChatGPT AI market. “For a larger company, to provide AI innovations to re-imagine the enterprise, the agentic enterprise in particular, it's going to need a lot of retooling to make it happen.”

The data industry has grown into a sprawling and fragmented web over the past decade — which makes it ripe for consolidation. All it needed was a catalyst. From 2020 through 2024 alone, more than $300 billion was invested into data startups across more than 24,000 deals, according to PitchBook data.

The data industry wasn't immune to the trends seen in other industries like SaaS where the venture swell of the last decade resulted in numerous startups getting funded by venture capitalists that only targeted one specific area or were in some cases built around a single feature.

The current industry standard of bundling together a bunch of different data management solutions, each with its own specific focus, doesn't work when you want AI to crawl around your data to find answers or build applications.

It makes sense that larger companies are looking to snap up startups that can plug into and fill existing gaps in their data stack. A perfect example of this trend is Fivetran's recent acquisition of Census in May — which yes, was done in the name of AI.

Fivetran helps companies move their data from a variety of sources into cloud databases. For the first 13 years of its business, it didn't allow customers to move this data back out of said databases, which is exactly what Census offers. This means prior to this acquisition, Fivetran customers needed to work with a second company to create an end-to-end solution.

To be clear, this isn't meant to cast shade on Fivetran. At the time of the deal, George Fraser, the co-founder and CEO of Fivetran, told TechCrunch that while moving data in and out of these warehouses seems like two sides of the same coin, it's not that simple; the company even tried and abandoned an in-house solution to this problem.

“Technically speaking, if you look at the code underneath [these] services, they're actually pretty different,” Fraser said at the time. “You have to solve a pretty different set of problems in order to do this.”

This situation helps illustrate how the data market has transformed in the last decade. For Sanjeev Mohan, a former Gartner analyst who now runs SanjMo, his own data trend advisory firm, these types of scenarios are a big driver of the current wave of consolidation.

“This consolidation is being driven by customers being fed up with a multitude of products that are incompatible,” Mohan said. “We live in a very interesting world where there are a lot of different data storage solutions, you can do open source, they can go to Kafka, but the one area where we have failed is metadata. Dozens of these products are capturing some metadata but to do their job, it's an overlap.”

The broader market plays a role here, too, Mohan said. Data startups are struggling to raise capital, Mohan said, and an exit is better than having to wind down or load up on debt. For the acquirers, adding features gives them better pricing leverage and an edge against their peers.

“If Salesforce or Google isn't acquiring these companies, then their competitors likely are,” Derek Hernandez, a senior emerging tech analyst at PitchBook, told TechCrunch. “The best solutions are being acquired currently. Even if you have an award-winning solution, I don't know that the outlook for staying private ultimately wins over going to a larger [acquirer].”

This trend brings big benefits to the startups getting acquired. The venture market is starving for exits and the current quiet period for IPOs doesn't leave them a lot of opportunities. Getting acquired not only provides that exit, but in many cases it also gives these founding teams room to keep building.

Mohan agreed and added that many data startups are feeling the pains of the current market regarding exits and the slow recovery of venture funding.

“At this point in time, acquisition has been a much more favorable exit strategy for them,” Hernandez said. “So I think, kind of both sides are very incentivized to get to the finish line on these. And I think Informatica is a good example of that, where even with a bit of a haircut from where Salesforce was talking to them last year, it's still, you know, was the best solution, according to their board.”

But the doubt still remains if this acquisition strategy will achieve the buyers' goals.

As Dhillon pointed out, the database companies being acquired weren't necessarily built to easily work with the rapidly changing AI market. Plus, if the company with the best data wins the AI world, will it make sense for data and AI companies to be separate entities?

“I think a lot of the value is in merging the major AI players with the data management companies,” Hernandez said. “I don't know that a stand-alone data management company is particularly incentivized to remain so and, kind of like, play a third party between enterprises and AI solutions.”

Think of a river - the water carves the banks, the banks channel the water. Which is the real river?A model is like the river banks, it is not intelligent in itself. Neither is activity by itself.

The contextual tokens (banks) vs the mass of probability for the next token (water). Agent environment (banks) vs agent activity (water).The trick here is that neither is capable of explaining the process, or more fundamental than the other. It is a recursive process rewriting its own rules.And we know from Godel, Turing and Chaitin that recursive processes exhibit incompleteness, undecidability and incompressibility. There is no way to predict them from outside, they can only be known only through unrolling, you have to be inside, or you have to be it to know it.

Plus: what went wrong with the Texas flash floods?

This is today's edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what's going on in the world of technology.

The latest threat from the rise of Chinese manufacturing

In 2013, a trio of academics showed convincing evidence that increased trade with China beginning in the early 2000s and the resulting flood of cheap imports had been an unmitigated disaster for many US communities, destroying their manufacturing lifeblood.

The results of what they called the “China shock” were gut-wrenching: the loss of 1 million US manufacturing jobs and 2.4 million jobs in total by 2011.If in retrospect all that seems obvious, it's only because the research by David Autor, an MIT labor economist, and his colleagues has become an accepted, albeit often distorted, political narrative these days: China destroyed all our manufacturing jobs! Though the nuances are often ignored, the results help explain at least some of today's political unrest. It's reflected in rising calls for US protectionism, President Trump's broad tariffs on imported goods, and nostalgia for the lost days of domestic manufacturing glory.

Our editor at large David Rotman recently spoke to Autor about what he considers a far more urgent problem——what some are calling China shock 2.0—and the lessons it holds for today's manufacturing challenges. Read the full story.



Three things I'm into into right now

In each issue of our print magazine, we ask a member of staff to tell us about three things they're loving at the moment. For our latest edition, which was all about power, I was in the hotseat! Check out my (frankly amazing) recommendations here, and subscribe to catch future editions here.



The must-reads

I've combed the internet to find you today's most fun/important/scary/fascinating stories about technology.

1 A new TikTok is coming It's reportedly launching a new version in the US in September ahead of a planned sale. (The Information $)+ It'll still require the Chinese government's say-so. (The Verge)

2 Texas Hill Country was caught off guard by the flash floodsBut now people are asking: why? (WP $)+ America's National Weather Service has been on the receiving end of heavy cuts. (CNN)+ Bad weather has interrupted ongoing searches for survivors. (WSJ $)

3 Elon Musk is forging ahead with his own political partyTo the chagrin of investors in his companies. (The Guardian)+ Former friend Donald Trump has some thoughts. (Insider $)+ The America Party is facing an uphill struggle. (WP $)4 The Trump administration has axed a group focused on birth control safetyThey were tasked with advising women which contraceptives to use. (Undark)

10 More than 30 tech unicorns have been minted during 2025And we could see a far few more before the year is out. (TechCrunch)



Quote of the day

“If you go in with the expectation that the AI is as smart or smarter than humans, you're quickly disappointed by the reality.”

—Eric Schwartz, chief marketing officer of Clorox, tells the Wall Street Journal that AI can't be relied upon to come up with truly original or engaging ideas.



One more thing

Alina Chan tweeted life into the idea that the virus came from a labAlina Chan started asking questions in March 2020. She was chatting with friends on Facebook about the virus then spreading out of China. She thought it was strange that no one had found any infected animal. She wondered why no one was admitting another possibility, which to her seemed very obvious: the outbreak might have been due to a lab accident.Chan is a postdoc in a gene therapy lab at the Broad Institute, a prestigious research institute affiliated with both Harvard and MIT. Throughout 2020, Chan relentlessly stoked scientific argument, and wasn't afraid to pit her brain against the best virologists in the world. Her persistence even helped change some researchers' minds. Read the full story.

—Antonio Regalado



We can still have nice things

A place for comfort, fun and distraction to brighten up your day. (Got any ideas? Drop me a line or skeet 'em at me.)+ Why 2025 might just be the year of animal escapes.+ Very cool—an iron age settlement has been uncovered in England thanks to a lucky metal detectorist.+ This little armadillo is having the time of their life in a paddling pool.+ Peace and love to Mr Ringo Starr, 85 years young today!

Prime Day is the perfect moment to pick up all kinds of gadgets, and Amazon's strategy is clear: boost sales by slashing prices on best-sellers whether they're from big brands or lesser-known names. If you're looking for a portable charger that can handle all your devices and comes with built-in cables as well as multiple outputs, this model is currently among the top five best-sellers on Amazon.

Now, you can get this 10,000mAh portable charger for just $19, a decrease from its normal price of $29. The 33% discount is the all-time lowest price on this top-selling power bank and it makes it a simple addition to your carry everyday bag. With over 11,000 reviews and an average rating of 4.6 out of 5 stars, it's a safe choice.

See at Amazon

With ultimate convenience in mind, this 10,000mAh portable power bank comes pre-equipped with four cables: three output cables and one input cable. The implication is that you can charge almost any device if you're an iPhone, iPad, Samsung, Pixel or other Micro USB and USB-C owner. With the integrated design, you wouldn't have to bother bringing separate cables or adapters so your charging process becomes simpler. Other than the integrated cables, the charger also comprises a total of six outputs and six devices that you can charge at once.

The charger also comes with three input ports: an integrated recharging cable, a USB-C port, and a Micro USB port. This flexibility makes it possible to charge the power bank through whatever cable you have available at hand, which makes it so much easier to get the charger itself ready. The portability is also exceptional with the charger being only 5.68 inches by 2.63 inches by 0.69 inches in dimension and weighing just 0.55 pounds.

There is a digital LED display that provides an accurate and real-time reading of residual battery life percentage so you'll never have to guess how much juice you have remaining. That way, you'll know when to re-fit the charger so you're prepared for your next activity.

Make sure you grab this fantastic Prime Day deal before it runs out of stock.

Anker, Jackery, and EcoFlow are engaged in a fierce competition to offer the best portable power stations on the market. Based on our experience and customer reviews, Anker consistently gets the edge with its innovation and reliability that set it apart from the competition.

If you're looking for a portable power station, Prime Day is the perfect time to buy: Amazon's event brings discounts rarely seen throughout the year as the retailer aims to boost sales volume. This year, the Anker SOLIX C1000 is available at its lowest price ever—just $499, down from $799, with no Prime membership required to access the deal. There's also a sale on the bundle with a 200W solar panel, marked down to $749 from $1,299.

See Anker Solix at Amazon

See Anker Solix + 200W Solar Panels at Amazon

The Solix C1000 has been designed to deliver high performance for a wide range of applications, from home backup in case of power failure to outdoor and RV use. Its 1056Wh LiFePO4 battery is built to endure, with a lifespan of 10 years and up to 3,000 charge cycles. That means you can rely on it for years to come, whether for backup in an emergency or portable power in the field. Anker's UltraFast charging technology is a big advantage: you can reach 80% battery in just 43 minutes and full battery in less than an hour with AC input.

Capable of delivering a continuous 1800W and 2400W peak via SurgePad technology, it can power up to 99% of household appliances. It has 11 ports, including AC sockets, USB-C, USB-A, and a car socket so you can charge anything from phones and laptops to mini fridges and medical devices. This level of compatibility is ideal if you're looking to keep all your essential devices running.

For those interested in sustainable energy, the Solix C1000 supports up to 600W fast solar recharging. Paired with the optional 200W solar panel, the station can be fully recharged in just 1.8 hours under optimal conditions. This feature is a game-changer if you're looking to embrace an eco-friendly lifestyle or need reliable power far from the grid.

The Solix C1000 is also engineered for portability: It's 15% lighter than comparable 1kWh units, which makes it more portable and easier to store. Whether you're stocking up for a weekend in the wilderness or simply need a home backup that won't take up too much room, this station is the way to go. The Anker app adds another level of control and enables you to modify charging speeds and monitor power usage in real time.

If you're looking for a reliable portable power solution, the Anker Solix C1000 at $499 is a rare opportunity. The additional solar panel bundle at $749 for Prime Day further enhances its appeal if you want to harness solar energy.

Patient-attributable delays exceeding 90 days in breast cancer care were associated with a more than threefold higher risk for 2-year mortality. Living alone emerged as the only independent predictor of prolonged patient-attributable delay (PPAD), increasing the risk for delay by 88.2%.

""Our findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to raise cancer symptom awareness and address barriers faced by vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and individuals living alone, to reduce delays, improve clinical outcomes, increase survival rates, and ultimately the quality of life for patients,"" the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Desirée Martín-García, Hospital Universitario Costa del Sol, Marbella, Spain. It was published online on June 24, 2025, in the European Journal of Surgical Oncology.

Psychosocial factors that contributed to delayed medical attention were not collected as part of the original study protocol, which limited the ability to fully understand patient motivations. This study relied on self-reported data regarding the time patients take to seek medical care, which may have introduced recall bias. Additionally, the study's focus on the Spanish healthcare context may have limited the generalisability of the findings to other settings with different healthcare systems and cultural dynamics.

This study received funding from the Carlos III Health Institute and Andalusian Ministry of Health, with co-funding from the European Social Fund/European Regional Development Fund. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

In the last several decades, vaccines have quietly transformed the world: wiping out once-devastating diseases, rewriting childhood illnesses, and pushing the boundaries of what medicine can prevent.

Much of the development of vaccines has been thanks to both private and federal grants. But that progress is under threat.

The federal government has proposed deep cuts to vaccine development funding — nearly halving the CDC's budget, shuttering its Global Health Center, and slashing spending on the National Institutes of Health by 43% — while continuing to phase out the US Agency for International Development.

That's where foundations come in. One of the biggest players is the Seattle-based Gates Foundation, founded by Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates. It is among the largest funders of global healthcare initiatives, dipping into its endowment as it enacts a spend-down plan that will double its charitable investments over the next two decades.

In 2000, the Gates Foundation made a landmark $750 million pledge to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance: a Geneva-based global health partnership that, according to the World Health Organization, has since delivered vaccines to more than a billion children.

“But even as our organization raises spending to $9 billion a year,” Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman notes, “it is unrealistic to think that private giving can make up the shortfall as public giving shrinks.”

Yet foundations are determined to try. In March, the nonprofit Council on Foundations in Washington, DC, polled 183 of its members and found that most (80%) were considering or planning a change of approach in light of expected government cuts, with 70% contemplating multiple changes. Some 44% were looking at shifting grantmaking priorities with an eye toward filling funding gaps, and 27% said they planned to increase their overall grantmaking budget or were at least considering it.

The Michelson Medical Research Foundation reports a surge of interest in its Michelson Prizes, which have helped finance early-career researchers in the fields of immunology and vaccine discovery since 2017. This year, as federal money dries up, the Los Angeles-based foundation has received a record number of applications.

“We're committed to bridging those immediate funding gaps, given what's happening with the loss of federal grants,” says program manager Michele Morris. “At the same time, we're looking for lasting solutions that can safeguard scientific progress and cultivate the next generation of biomedical leaders.”

Foundation leaders, meanwhile, appear to be lying low as the current budget bill wends its way through Congress. Many declined to go on the record for this article or simply didn't reply to interview requests. Still, they've made their positions clear. In April, Suzman wrote an op-ed piece for The Economist in which he noted that assistance to poor countries had already fallen “off a cliff,” with affluent nations like France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom planning to reduce their aid budgets by “around a third.”

Even as many remain quiet publicly, behind the scenes, collaboration is gaining traction. One of the most widely supported ideas was to join forces with fellow funders: 54% of those surveyed said they would seek “new opportunities to collaborate” with other foundations, much the way Gates works with Gavi.

Not all foundations are rethinking their strategies. The Novo Nordisk Foundation, with its Initiative for Vaccines and Immunity (NIVI), is staying on course. In 2023, in partnership with the University of Copenhagen, it established a limited liability company now known as NIVI-Development, or NIVI-D. Its aim is to complement and accelerate the work of NIVI-Research, initially focused on tuberculosis, influenza, and group A streptococcus. “The gap between basic research and vaccine development is often difficult to bridge,” notes a foundation spokesperson. “But NIVI-D is set up to do exactly that, boosting the chances of success.”

Chicago's MacArthur Foundation, best known for its no-strings-attached “genius” grants, isn't usually associated with the health field. But in 2021, in the thick of the COVID-19 pandemic, it made headlines with a grant to the Vaccine Confidence Project (VCP), a London-based research group that tracks attitudes toward vaccines worldwide. Also funded by foundations linked to pharmaceutical companies such as AstraZeneca and Merck, the VCP helps implement immunization programs that have addressed outbreaks ranging from Ebola in West Africa to the Zika virus in Brazil.

Founded in 2010 to fight vaccine myths — such as those that prompted resistance to an earlier polio eradication effort in Nigeria — the VCP received fresh support during the pandemic that began a decade later. But vaccine hesitancy remains a tough nut. Earlier this year, a KFF tracking poll found that at least moderate faith in the FDA had dropped to 53%, compared to 65% in June 2023, with a third of respondents maintaining that vaccines' risks outweigh their benefits. General trust in public health has also eroded over the years. In short, vaccine initiatives have been hit with a double whammy: mounting skepticism plus deep budget cuts in the name of government efficiency.

Ironically, one thing that attracted the data-driven Gates Foundation to Gavi is that its immunization efforts are so cost-effective. A 2020 study of 73 countries showed that $1 spent on vaccine programs resulted in savings of $21 in medical costs, as well as lost wages and productivity. Factoring in the broader societal value of lives saved, Gavi claims an even more impressive return on investment: $54 for each dollar spent.

Whatever the precise ROI, it's a point that health-sector foundations grasp — even as government support wanes. As the Michelson Foundation's Morris says, “It's less expensive to safeguard the community than it is to care for the community once it becomes ill.”

Despite concerns about cognitive decline after cancer treatment, most breast cancer survivors show no increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, and some may have a slightly lower risk than their cancer-free peers, according to a large retrospective study from Korea.

However, any apparent protective effect faded with time, the investigators reported online in JAMA Network Open.

Overall, this is “reassuring news for cancer survivors,” Tim Ahles, PhD, a psychologist with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, who wasn't involved in the study, told Medscape Medical News.

“I get this question from patients a lot,” Ahles said. And based on these findings, “it doesn't look like a history of breast cancer and breast cancer treatment increases your risk for Alzheimer's disease.”

Breast cancer survivors often report cancer-related cognitive impairment, such as difficulties with concentration and memory, both during and after cancer treatment. But evidence surrounding patients' risk for Alzheimer's disease is mixed. One large study based in Sweden, for instance, reported a 35% increased risk for Alzheimer's disease among patients diagnosed with breast cancer after the age of 65 years, but not among younger patients. A population-based study from Taiwan, however, found no increase in the risk for dementia overall compared with cancer-free individuals but did note a lower dementia risk in patients who had received tamoxifen.

To help clarify the evidence, investigators assessed Alzheimer's disease risk in a large cohort of patients and explored the association by treatment type, age, and important risk factors.

Using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database, the researchers matched 70,701 patients who underwent breast cancer surgery between 2010 and 2016 with 180,360 cancer-free control individuals.

The mean age of breast cancer survivors was 53.1 years. Overall, 72% received radiotherapy. Cyclophosphamide (57%) and anthracycline (50%) were the most commonly used chemotherapies, and tamoxifen (47%) and aromatase inhibitors (30%) were the most commonly used endocrine therapies.

The primary outcome of this study was the incidence of newly diagnosed Alzheimer's disease, which was defined on the basis of at least one prescription for medications to manage dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, or memantine).

During a median follow-up of about 7 years, 1229 newly diagnosed Alzheimer's disease cases were detected in breast cancer survivors and 3430 cases in control individuals — incidence rates of 2.45 and 2.63 per 1000 person-years, respectively.

This corresponded to an 8% lower risk for Alzheimer's disease in breast cancer survivors compared with cancer-free control individuals at 6 months (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.98). The association was especially notable in survivors older than 65 years (SHR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85-0.99).

Looking at individual treatment modalities, only radiation therapy was associated with significantly lower risk for Alzheimer's disease among breast cancer survivors (adjusted HR [aHR], 0.77).

Several risk factors were associated with a significantly higher risk for Alzheimer's disease: current smoker vs never or ex-smokers (aHR, 2.04), diabetes (aHR, 1.58), and chronic kidney disease (aHR, 3.11). Notably, alcohol use, physical activity level, and hypertension were not associated with Alzheimer's disease risk.

However, any potential protective effect may be short-lived. The reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease was no longer significant at 1 year (SHR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.87-1.01), 3 years (SHR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.90-1.05), or 5 years (SHR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.89-1.08).

Even so, breast cancer survivors can still feel reassured by the findings.

“Concerns about chemobrain and the long-term adverse effects of breast cancer treatment on cognition are common, but our findings suggest that this treatment does not directly lead to Alzheimer's disease,” wrote the authors, led by Su-Min Jeong, MD, with Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.

Ahles agreed. The general takeaway from this study is that there is “no strong evidence that the cancer treatment is going to increase your risk for developing Alzheimer's,” Ahles said. When patients ask about the risk for Alzheimer's disease, “I can say, ‘Here's yet another new study that supports the idea that there's no increased risk.'”

He cautioned, however, that the study doesn't address whether people with a genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's might develop it sooner due to cancer treatment.

“Does the cancer treatment increase your probability or nudge you along? The study doesn't answer that question,” Ahles said.

The study reported having no commercial funding. Jeong and Ahles reported having no relevant disclosures.

DISCLOSURES |  July 07, 2025  

Editor's Note:The Case Challenge series includes difficult-to-diagnose conditions, some of which are not frequently encountered by most clinicians, but are nonetheless important to accurately recognize. Test your diagnostic and treatment skills using the following patient scenario and corresponding questions. If you have a case that you would like to suggest for a future Case Challenge, please email us at ccsuggestions@medscape.com with the subject line ""Case Challenge Suggestion."" We look forward to hearing from you.

A 35-year-old man with a history of two prior spontaneous pneumothoraxes — both managed conservatively — presents to the emergency department with new-onset chest pain and lightheadedness. The pain is described as sudden, intense, and exacerbated by deep breathing. He indicates that it is located in the center of the chest. He denies dyspnea or leg swelling and has no other complaints. When asked, he says this pain is different from his pneumothorax pain, mainly because it is in the center of his chest.

Vital signs are within normal limits, except for a pulse > 120 bpm. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds on the left hemithorax. There are no rales or wheezes and no leg edema.

Central pleuritic chest pain in a patient with a history of pneumothorax suggests a pulmonary etiology. A chest x-ray is the most appropriate investigation to promptly assess for recurrent pneumothorax, pleural effusion, structural abnormalities, or other intrathoracic pathology.

ECG or cardiac biomarkers such as troponins are indicated primarily if myocardial ischemia or infarction is suspected. This suspicion would be raised if the patient described his chest pain as squeezing or pressure-like sensation radiating to the neck, jaw, or left arm. The patient's young age and lack of history of coronary artery disease also make acute coronary syndrome less likely.

A CBC may provide supplementary information about signs of infection or inflammation, especially if the chest x-ray appears normal, but a CBC alone is unlikely to determine the cause of the patient's acute pleuritic chest pain.

On initial testing, chest x-ray, metabolic panel, and troponin level were normal. CBC showed an elevated white blood cell count (16,200/μL). An ECG was also performed (Figure 1).

Figure 1. ECG performed on patient in ED.

Despite the central location of symptoms, the patient's young age, history of pneumothorax, and presence of pleuritic chest pain would have placed pneumothorax high on the initial differential diagnosis. After pneumothorax was ruled out with chest x-ray, PE should have become the leading consideration given the pleuritic pain and the patient's age group, in which PE is far more common than coronary artery disease. Although anxiety is also common in this age group — as it is in others — it should remain a diagnosis of exclusion, considered only after more serious conditions have been reasonably ruled out.

While the ECG is not diagnostic of PE, it raises suspicion by demonstrating three supportive findings: tachycardia, incomplete right bundle branch block, and nonspecific ST-segment changes.[1] A subsequent D-dimer test was positive, and chest CT angiography showed extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli, more pronounced on the left side.

PE typically presents as either unilateral pleuritic chest pain or as dyspnea with or without chest pain.[1] However, PE can present without the typical symptom of chest pain, sometimes being asymptomatic or discovered incidentally during diagnostic workup for other conditions.[1,2,3] Other symptoms of large pulmonary emboli may include syncope, diaphoresis, and cardiac arrest. Other symptoms of smaller emboli may include minor hemoptysis or cough.[1,3]

Although most patients with PE have at least one identifiable risk factor, up to 20% of patients present without any known risk factor, so the absence of risk factors should not exclude the diagnosis.[1]

Pain in patients with PE is believed to result from pulmonary infarction, which typically occurs when small to medium emboli lodge distally in the peripheral pulmonary arteries — areas with limited collateral circulation — making them more susceptible to infarction. The absence of chest pain does not exclude PE and may contribute to missed diagnoses, increasing the risk of patient morbidity and mortality.

PE classically presents with pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea associated with known risk factors, tachycardia, and clear lungs both on auscultation and chest radiography. However, most patients with PE present with one or more atypical features, which may include the absence of pain or any known risk factors and/or normal or nonspecific ECG findings.[1] About 40% of patients with PE have tachycardia.[1]

Scoring systems such as the PE Rule-out Criteria (PERC) can be useful in evaluating patients with suspected PE, but clinicians must be familiar with both the inclusion and exclusion criteria and should recognize that applying PERC requires a low pretest probability based on clinical judgment and the presence of a more likely alternate diagnosis with adequate supporting evidence.

When PE cannot be excluded based on clinical assessment, diagnostic testing is warranted, typically beginning with a D-dimer assay. If the D-dimer is positive, imaging with CT pulmonary angiography or a or ventilation-perfusion scan should follow.[2,3] D-dimer should not be ordered reflexively or “just in case,” as this often leads to unnecessary imaging. As Greg Henry advises, ”In medicine and life, don't ask questions you don't really want to know the answer to.”

PE is typically treated with anticoagulants unless they are absolutely contraindicated, in which case a vena cava interruption filter may be used.[2,3,4] The treatment setting and choice of anticoagulant depend on various factors, including PE severity, comorbidities, and bleeding risk.[3] Most patients are admitted for treatment initiation, but some low-risk patients may be discharged with oral anticoagulants.[2] Patients with hypotension or right ventricular strain often require ICU admission for close monitoring and may be treated with thrombolytic therapy or, in some cases, surgical intervention.[1,2,3]

The absolute contraindication to thrombolytic therapy is a history of intracranial hemorrhage, due to a significantly increased risk of catastrophic bleeding.[1,2,4] Thrombolytic agents can dissolve blood clots, but they also impair hemostasis.

A history of pneumothorax episodes is not considered an absolute contraindication to thrombolytics in this patient.[1] Anemia is an important clinical factor that significantly increases the risk of bleeding during anticoagulation, but it does not preclude thrombolysis, if not caused by active bleeding or associated with a significant coagulopathy.[1,3,5]

Hemodynamic instability is not a contraindication but rather an indication for thrombolytic therapy in patients with massive PE. The benefits of restoring circulation outweigh the bleeding risk associated with thrombolysis.[1,2,4]

Hospital admission on intravenous heparin is reasonable. The patient could deteriorate if additional thrombi embolize. ICU admission is typically reserved for patients who remain unstable or require intravenous fibrinolytics. Discharge may be appropriate for stable patients who meet discharge criteria. For patients who are stable but do not qualify for discharge and have a low risk of decompensation, admission to a general medical floor may be considered.

Because this patient's CT angiography showed extensive PE and his vital signs were concerning, thrombolytics were considered. However, after heparin was initiated, his vital signs normalized within a few hours, so he was able to be admitted to a telemetry bed.

Although most patients with PE meet criteria for outpatient treatment,[3,4] a minority of eligible patients are actually discharged from the emergency department despite having an estimated mortality risk of less than 3%.[1,2] Risk stratification tools such as the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index and the Hestia criteria can help identify candidates for outpatient treatment. Clinicians should also consider using an online calculator (eg, MDcalc.com). In addition to PE severity, clinicians should evaluate the patient's bleeding risk on anticoagulation when making disposition decisions.[1,2,3,4]

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Let's talk about the cone method, a super effective way to ask questions, especially in clinical settings. Picture a cone: It starts wide at the top and narrows at the bottom. That's exactly how your questioning should go. Start broad and then get specific. For example, if a patient comes in with abdominal pain, you don't jump straight to “Is it dull or sharp?”

You start with “Tell me more about the pain.” That open-ended approach lets the patient tell their story without you leading them. Then, you slowly narrow in. “Where is it located? When did it start? What makes it better or worse?” This method helps you get a full, more accurate picture without missing key details. It also makes patients feel heard — because they are. 

And honestly, this works outside of medicine too. Whether you're interviewing someone, having a tough conversation, or just trying to understand a friend better, start wide, get curious, and then go deep.

A 66-year-old man presented with generalised jaundice, significant weight loss, and epigastric pain. Diagnostic imaging, including ultrasound, CT, and MRI, revealed a periampullary duodenal diverticulum (PAD) compressing the distal common bile duct (CBD), leading to luminal dilatation without the presence of stones or malignancy.

A case report by Masome Aghaei Lasboo, MD, at the Department of Internal Medicine, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran, and colleagues, highlighted the diagnostic challenges of Lemmel syndrome, a condition frequently misdiagnosed due to its rarity and non-specific presentation.

The patient was admitted to the hospital with no significant medical history after experiencing ten days of intermittent fever, nausea, and vomiting two to three times daily, particularly after meals, along with general jaundice and abdominal pain.

Jaundice was first noted in the eyes and progressed to involve the face and body by day 5.

Four days prior to hospitalisation, the patient experienced colicky abdominal pain in the epigastric and right upper quadrant regions. Each episode lasted for 20-30 minutes.

Importantly, the pain did not worsen with eating, bowel movements, or changes in body position, suggesting a non-intestinal aetiology. He also reported significant weight loss over the past 6 months. Additional symptoms included nocturnal sweats, fatigue, generalised weakness, and anorexia. His medication, family, social, travel, and allergy histories were unremarkable.

On admission, the vital signs were pulse 85 beats/min, temperature 37.0 °C, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 95% on room air.

Abdominal examination revealed no palpable masses or areas of tenderness. Murphy's sign was negative. The liver span was approximately 10 cm. The patient had no history of gall bladder disease or alcohol use.

Laboratory results were as follows:

Serological tests for hepatitis C virus antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen, and anti-leptospira antibodies were negative.

An initial ultrasound of the bile ducts and liver showed that the CBD was nearly normal in diameter (5-7.6 mm), with no evidence of stones. The gall bladder had an average wall thickness and contained small amounts of sludge, but no stones were visualised. Follow-up imaging with CT and MRI revealed dilation of the middle and proximal segments of the CBD, measuring 11-12 mm in diameter. A 21-25 mm PAD was noted on the medial wall of the second part of the duodenum, compressing the distal CBD and leading to upstream bile duct dilation. The presence of gas and food particles within the diverticulum indicated mechanical obstruction.

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed to further evaluate the patient. It revealed gastroesophageal reflux disease, Los Angeles class B, mild antral gastritis, and bile reflux.

The second part of the duodenum showed normal mucosa without ulcerations or masses. These findings ruled out obstructive tumours or intrinsic duodenal lesions and supported the diagnosis of Lemmel syndrome, caused by extrinsic compression from the PAD. The patient was treated with intravenous fluids, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole during hospitalisation. After his pain, fever, and laboratory markers normalised, he was discharged after 23 days.

“Although Lemmel syndrome is rare, it remains an important differential diagnosis for obstructive jaundice, especially in the absence of gallstones or tumours. Early recognition and imaging-based diagnosis are critical to prevent complications such as cholangitis and pancreatitis,” the authors wrote.

Measuring copeptin levels in patients with hypotonic hyponatremia on emergency department (ED) admission provided key diagnostic insights. The copeptin to urinary sodium ratio more accurately predicted preserved extracellular fluid (ECF) than urinary sodium alone, and higher copeptin levels were linked to an increased risk for mortality.

“It is important to note that our results do not suggest replacing copeptin with other established clinical and biochemical evaluations routinely performed in emergency care, such as s-K [serum potassium] or NT-proBNP [N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide] levels, when clinically appropriate. Rather, the aim of adjusting copeptin's predictive value for these common parameters in our analysis was to confirm its independent contribution,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Alessandro Maria Berton, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy. It was published online in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism.

Patient recruitment was restricted to daytime hours and weekdays, thus limiting the generalizability. Certain analytes were not available for all patients during ED evaluation. Additional urinary parameters such as urine chloride, uric acid fractional excretion, and potassium levels were not compared with the copeptin/urinary sodium index.

This study received no specific grant from any funding agency. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Scientists reveal that children exposed to certain plastic-derived chemicals before age five face higher risks of asthma and wheeze, underscoring growing concerns over everyday environmental exposures.

Study: Phthalates and bisphenols early-life exposure, and childhood allergic conditions: a pooled analysis of cohort studies. Image Credit: antoniodiaz / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology, researchers utilized an extensive (n = 5,306) pooled Australian, United States (US), and Canadian cohort to investigate the clinical outcomes of childhood and early life (before the age of 5) exposure to harmful plastic-derived chemicals.

Their findings reveal that increased prenatal and early-life exposure to phthalates and bisphenols, chemicals found in many everyday products such as shampoos and food packaging, was associated with a modestly increased risk of developing asthma and other allergic conditions by preschool age. The findings contribute to a growing body of evidence on how we address invisible pollutants that surround us and our children from birth.

Exposure timing in pregnancy mattered more than expected: First-trimester BPS exposure showed a stronger link to asthma (2.45x higher risk), while second-trimester DBP, BBzP, and MCPP levels were more strongly tied to later asthma development.

Phthalates and bisphenols, ubiquitous chemicals found in plastics, packaging, toys, grooming, and personal-care products, are increasingly scrutinized for their potentially harmful effects on child health. A growing body of evidence suggests that these persistent environmental contaminants act as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), altering metabolic and neurodevelopmental pathways and having potentially lifelong consequences.

The impacts of phthalates and bisphenols on respiratory outcomes and allergies remain less understood. While a limited number of epidemiological investigations have linked these EDCs with an increased risk of adverse childhood respiratory outcomes (wheezing, eczema, asthma, and rhinitis), recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have flagged these findings as inconsistent and often confounding, potentially due to a glaring lack of methodological standardization between studies.

Furthermore, even in this understudied field, investigations on the impacts of EDCs on children under the age of five, a period of rapid development and exacerbated chemical sensitivity, are underrepresented. Consequently, clinicians and policymakers have little to no scientific evidence upon which to base their public health and environmental recommendations.

The phthalate metabolite MCPP emerged as a notable player: It was linked to increased prenatal rhinitis and postnatal wheeze risk, and also carried the heaviest weight in the chemical mixture associated with wheezing.

The present study aims to address this knowledge gap and inform future environmental and public health policy. By pooling major birth cohorts across three countries, it evaluates how urinary levels of phthalates and bisphenols (measured during pregnancy and early childhood) correlate with diagnosed allergic outcomes by age five. The study further aims to elucidate if any identified EDC-allergy risk associations are influenced by exposure timing, dose, or sex.

Study data were obtained and pooled from four established longitudinal cohorts: 1. Australia's Barwon Infant Study (BIS), 2. Canada's Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development Study (CHILD) study, and the United States' (US's) 3. Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study and 4. Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO).

Individuals with preserved urinary samples or urinary phthalates and bisphenols data from their first five years of life (postnatal subcohort) or pregnancy time (prenatal), alongside at least one allergy test from the same period, were included as current study participants. EDCs were characterized and quantified using standardized high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS).

Study outcomes (wheezing, asthma, rhinitis, and eczema) were assessed using several cohort-specific questionnaires (e.g., the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire). Where possible, caregiver-reported questionnaires were supplemented with clinical allergy evaluations. Sex-stratified generalized estimating equations (for chemical analysis) and quantile G-computation (to evaluate the cumulative effects of several co-occurring EDCs) were leveraged, accounting for potential sociodemographic confounders.

The present study validates a link between plastic-derived EDCs and adverse childhood respiratory outcomes. It leverages a final sample cohort of 5,306 children. It reveals that prenatal exposure to dibutyl phthalates (DBP) and butyl benzyl phthalate (BBzP) is associated with a higher risk of asthma in children under five. A two-fold increase in exposure to these phthalates corresponded to a 6-8% increase in asthma risk (RR = 1.08 for DBP and 1.06 for BBzP).

Prenatal analysis models adjusted for cohort membership, maternal age, ethnicity, parental education, marital status, family history of asthma, prenatal tobacco smoke exposure, and season of birth. Postnatal analysis models were further adjusted for breastfeeding duration, age at outcome assessment, postnatal smoke exposure and gestational age.

Mono-(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP), one of the most common phthalate metabolites, was similarly associated with a 5% increased risk of rhinitis (relative risk, RR = 1.05). Postnatal phthalate exposure showed similar trends, with BBzP, DEHP, and MCPP levels all associated with an increased risk of childhood wheezing (5-9%).

Additionally, combined exposure to a mixture of phthalates was associated with a higher risk of wheezing, with mixture models revealing that a one-quartile increase in overall postnatal chemical exposure increased the risk of childhood wheeze by 14%.

DEHP exposure showed a complex picture: While associated with increased wheezing risk postnatally, higher levels were also unexpectedly linked to a slightly lower risk of childhood eczema.

The study also investigated other factors, finding only limited evidence that the effects of these chemicals differed between boys and girls. However, the analysis did suggest that the timing of exposure during pregnancy could be important, with stronger associations observed for exposure during the first and second trimesters for certain outcomes. The study also noted that some associations were non-linear, following U-shaped or inverted U-shaped patterns, meaning that risk did not always increase steadily with higher exposure.

While the study found no statistically significant associations for bisphenols like BPA, the authors note that low detection rates for these chemicals may have limited the statistical power to identify minor effects. Curiously, high-molecular-weight phthalates were associated with a lower risk of eczema. The study's authors suggest that this surprising finding requires further investigation, noting that it could be influenced by factors such as reverse causation, where children with eczema may use more personal care products.

With over 5,000 children from across continents contributing to its dataset, this large-scale, multinational study adds to the growing body of evidence that early-life exposure to phthalates may subtly increase the risk of childhood asthma, wheeze, and rhinitis. Although associations between bisphenols and respiratory conditions could not be observed, these findings suggest a need for reduced exposure to plastic-derived chemicals during pregnancy and early childhood. The authors themselves caution that the observed effects are modest on an individual level and highlight study limitations, such as differences in data collection between cohorts and the potential for unmeasured confounding factors, underscoring the need for further research.

CD8⁺ T cells are the immune system's frontline warriors, charged with detecting and eliminating cancer cells. But in the hostile and chronic environment of tumors, these cells often falter. Prolonged exposure to antigens, lack of co-stimulatory signals, and a barrage of suppressive molecules push them into an exhausted state. Like batteries drained of power, they stop proliferating, reduce cytokine production, and overexpress inhibitory receptors like PD-1, CTLA-4, and LAG-3. Worse still, their mitochondria and metabolism break down, leaving them energy-starved. Due to these compounded dysfunctions, many cancer treatments struggle to sustain durable responses. Faced with these challenges, there's an urgent need to investigate how to reactivate these fatigued immune fighters.

In a comprehensive review (DOI: /10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2024.0628) published in Cancer Biology & Medicine, researchers from Jining Medical University examine the multi-layered causes and consequences of CD8⁺ T cell exhaustion in cancer. Their work pulls together insights across immunology, epigenetics, metabolism, and tumor biology to present a unified picture of how immune fatigue develops—and how it might be reversed. By exploring both the molecular roots and therapeutic frontiers of exhaustion, the study provides a compelling roadmap for designing next-generation immunotherapies that overcome this critical barrier.

The review decodes the layered mechanisms driving CD8⁺ T cell exhaustion—a process that unfolds when cancer persists and overwhelms immune defenses. A major contributor is the tumor microenvironment (TME), where immune suppressor cells like Tregs and MDSCs flood the space with IL-10 and TGF-β, while stromal fibroblasts erect physical and biochemical barriers. Hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and excess adenosine further compound the damage. Exhausted T cells show high expression of inhibitory receptors, faltering metabolism, and epigenetic marks that lock them into dysfunction.

Key molecular players include transcription factors like TOX, NR4A, and BATF, which rewire gene expression away from effector functions. Meanwhile, non-coding RNAs and histone modifiers reinforce this altered identity. Yet hope lies in reversing this trajectory. The authors highlight promising tools: immune checkpoint inhibitors, epigenetic modulators, metabolic reprogramming, and even gut microbiota reshaping. Engineering T cells—via CAR-T platforms or CRISPR tools—to resist exhaustion is emerging as a particularly powerful strategy. Notably, combinations that simultaneously relieve immune suppression and boost T cell resilience are showing the most promise. The review emphasizes that tailored, multi-pronged therapies will be essential for achieving lasting tumor control.

Exhausted CD8⁺ T cells are like soldiers trapped behind enemy lines—cut off from reinforcements and starved of fuel. Our review reveals how cancer exploits this weakness and, more importantly, how we can intervene. By targeting the underlying checkpoints, metabolic imbalances, and epigenetic blocks, we can restore their combat readiness. The future of immunotherapy lies not just in attacking cancer, but in empowering the immune system to fight back with full force.""

Dr. Tao Zhong, senior author of the study

This work paves the way for more precise and effective cancer immunotherapies. By mapping the exhaustion landscape, researchers and clinicians can better stratify patients and tailor treatments to individual immune states. Biomarkers of exhaustion may help identify who will benefit most from checkpoint inhibitors or combination therapies. Moreover, interventions like CAR-T cell reprogramming or microbiome modulation could extend the reach of immunotherapy to patients with previously resistant tumors. Ultimately, reinvigorating exhausted T cells could transform cancer from a terminal diagnosis into a manageable condition—and reshape the future of precision oncology.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Scientists discover key signal for artificial blood production","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250707/Scientists-discover-key-signal-for-artificial-blood-production.aspx","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 17:28:00 GMT","

Scientists have been working on the artificial production of blood for several decades. Now, researchers from the University of Konstanz and Queen Mary University of London have taken an important step closer to that goal with a new discovery.

Roughly 15,000 units of blood are needed daily in Germany, most of which currently come from donations. Research into developing alternative sources, such as large-scale artificial blood production, has been ongoing for decades but is still far from reaching its widespread utility. The main challenge lies in the complex and still not fully appreciated means how our bodies naturally produce this vital fluid. 

Doctor Julia Gutjahr, a biologist at the Institute of Cellular Biology and Immunology Thurgau at the University of Konstanz, studies the mechanisms of blood production. Together with colleagues from Queen Mary University of London, she has identified the molecular signal, chemokine CXCL12, that triggers the expulsion of the nucleus by the red blood cell precursors, a key step in the development of red blood cells.

In the body, natural blood production takes place in the bone marrow. Stem cells develop into erythroblasts, which are precursor cells to erythrocytes - the red blood cells.

""In the final stage of an erythroblast's development into an erythrocyte, the erythroblast expels its nucleus. This process only occurs in mammals, allowing to make more room for haemoglobin involved in the transport of oxygen"", Gutjahr explains.

While the process of stem cell maturation into erythrocytes is now nearly optimised, it was previously unclear what factors induce the expulsion of the nucleus. ""We discovered that the chemokine CXCL12 found mainly in bone marrow can trigger such nucleus expulsion, albeit in an interplay with several factors. By adding CXCL12 to erythroblasts at the right moment, we were able to artificially induce the expulsion of their nucleus,"" says Gutjahr.

This finding is a scientific breakthrough that in the future should help make artificial blood production much more efficient. However, further research will still be necessary. Gutjahr began this work in 2019 as a postdoctoral researcher in the Lab of Professor Antal Rot at Queen Mary University of London. She is now continuing her research at the University of Konstanz. Since 2023, she has led her own research groups at the Institute of Cellular Biology and Immunology Thurgau, where she continues the studies on CXCL12.

""We are currently investigating how to use CXCL12 to optimize the artificial production of human erythrocytes,"" Gutjahr explains.

Importantly, apart from immediate practical application for the industrial production of red blood cells, our results brought a completely new understanding of cell biological mechanisms involved in erythroblast responses to chemokines. While all other cells migrate when stimulated by CXCL12, in erythroblasts this signalling molecule is transported into the interior of the cell, even into the nucleus. There, it accelerates their maturation and helps to expel the nucleus. Our research shows for the first time that chemokine receptors not only act on the cell surface but also inside the cell, thus opening entirely new perspectives on their role in cell biology.""

Professor Antal Rot at Queen Mary University of London

Stem cells are currently the most effective method for producing artificial blood with nuclear expulsion taking place in about 80% of cells. However, stem cell sources are limited relying on isolation from umbilical cord blood or bone marrow donations for the treatment of specific diseases, not feasible for mass production of blood to fulfil the clinical need.

However, recently it became possible to reprogram different types of cells into stem cells and use them to generate red blood cells. This approach offers an almost unlimited cell source for artificial blood production, but takes much longer, and the success rate for nucleus expulsion is only about 40%. ""Based on our new findings highlighting the key role of CXCL12 in triggering nuclear expulsion, we can expect that using CXCL12 should bring significant improvement in producing red blood cells from reprogrammed cells,"" says Gutjahr.

If large-scale production becomes possible, a wide range of applications could emerge. ""Even though body cells are readily available, the lab-based production process will remain complex. But it would enable the targeted generation of rare blood types, help bridge shortages, or allow individuals to reproduce their own blood for specialized treatments in many different diseases,"" says Gutjahr.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Multicenter study supports cautious use of low-dose HCQ in severe COVID-19 cases","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250707/Multicenter-study-supports-cautious-use-of-low-dose-HCQ-in-severe-COVID-19-cases.aspx","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 04:50:00 GMT","

This multicenter study investigates the association between hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) dosage and COVID-19 mortality among hospitalized patients in China, aiming to clarify conflicting evidence from prior research. Leveraging data from multiple medical centers, the analysis focuses on determining whether low-dose HCQ confers mortality benefits with acceptable safety, contrasting with potential risks of higher doses. By systematically evaluating clinical outcomes across different HCQ dosage groups, the research seeks to provide evidence-informed guidance for antiviral therapy in COVID-19 management, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

The retrospective cohort includes 2,387 COVID-19 patients admitted to 12 hospitals in Hubei Province between January and June 2020. Patients are categorized into three groups: non-HCQ use (n=1,124), low-dose HCQ (≤600 mg/day, n=893), and high-dose HCQ (>600 mg/day, n=370). Baseline characteristics are compared across groups, with adjustments for age, sex, comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), disease severity (mild, severe, critical), and concurrent medications (antibiotics, glucocorticoids). The primary endpoint is all-cause mortality, while secondary endpoints include treatment-related adverse events (AEs), such as QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias.

Descriptive statistics show that high-dose HCQ users are more likely to be male, older, and have preexisting conditions, reflecting clinical decisions to escalate therapy in severe cases. Univariate analysis reveals significantly lower mortality in the low-dose HCQ group (15.2%) compared to non-HCQ (22.8%) and high-dose HCQ (28.9%) groups (p<0.001 for both comparisons). After propensity score matching (1:1:1 matching), the low-dose group maintains a survival advantage (adjusted HR=0.68, 95% CI: 0.51-0.90, p=0.008), while the high-dose group exhibits higher mortality (HR=1.32, 95% CI: 1.05-1.67, p=0.018). Subgroup analyses by disease severity show consistent benefits of low-dose HCQ in severe (HR=0.72, p=0.023) and critical (HR=0.65, p=0.011) patients, but no significant effect in mild cases.

Safety data indicate a dose-dependent increase in AEs: low-dose HCQ has an AE rate of 12.7%, comparable to non-HCQ (10.9%, p=0.21), while high-dose HCQ shows a significantly higher rate (22.4%, p<0.001). The most common AEs are gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea) and electrolyte imbalances, with rare but serious ventricular arrhythmias (2.1% in high-dose vs. 0.8% in low-dose, p=0.03). Multivariate Cox regression identifies high-dose HCQ (HR=1.45, 95% CI: 1.12-1.87, p=0.005) and older age (HR=1.08 per year, p<0.001) as independent risk factors for mortality, while low-dose HCQ (HR=0.79, 95% CI: 0.63-0.99, p=0.04) and early treatment initiation (within 5 days of symptom onset, HR=0.64, p=0.002) are protective.

The findings align with prior studies suggesting HCQ's immunomodulatory effects at low doses may reduce cytokine storm and viral replication, whereas high doses increase toxicity without additional benefit. Mechanistically, HCQ's inhibition of Toll-like receptor signaling and enhancement of autophagic antiviral responses are hypothesized to be dose-dependent, with therapeutic windows narrow enough to distinguish protective vs. toxic effects. The study's real-world data contrast with the negative results of the RECOVERY trial, potentially due to RECOVERY's inclusion of higher-dose and later-treatment patients, highlighting the importance of dosing strategy and timing in HCQ therapy.

Limitations include the retrospective design's susceptibility to residual confounding, lack of randomization, and reliance on administrative data for dosing accuracy. Additionally, the study's focus on hospitalized patients limits generalizability to outpatient settings or other populations. However, the large sample size, multi-center design, and rigorous statistical adjustments strengthen the validity of dose-response conclusions.

Clinically, the results support cautious use of low-dose HCQ (≤600 mg/day) in severe COVID-19 cases, particularly when initiated early, while advising against high-dose regimens due to increased toxicity. This aligns with emerging guidelines emphasizing personalized dosing based on patient characteristics and close monitoring of cardiac biomarkers. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings and explore HCQ's role in combination with other antiviral agents, such as remdesivir or nirmatrelvir.

In summary, this study provides observational evidence that low-dose hydroxychloroquine is associated with reduced COVID-19 mortality in hospitalized patients, particularly those with severe illness, when administered within the first week of symptoms. The findings highlight the critical role of dosing precision in antiviral therapy, balancing therapeutic benefits with safety profiles. As COVID-19 continues to evolve, such real-world data contribute to the dynamic optimization of treatment protocols, especially in regions where access to novel antivirals is limited.

Studies suggest mindfulness meditation can improve cognition, but few researchers have examined whether virtual mindfulness meditation apps are effective. In a new eNeuro paper, Andy Kim et al., from the University of Southern California, assessed attention control in adults following about a month of mindfulness meditation guided by a mobile app. 

In participants of all ages, mindfulness improved attention control as measured by reliable eye movement tasks established to assess how quickly people orient their attention. A control group that listened to an audio book did not have this cognitive improvement. Notably, self-reported measures of cognitive ability, including attention and distractibility, suggest that participants were not aware of the cognitive improvement from meditation. 

According to the authors, they are among the first to measure cognitive improvements from mindfulness using a reliable eye task in addition to self-reporting surveys. Future work may probe whether longer-term mindfulness interventions strengthen the effects observed in this study.

The Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS, President Lee Ho Seong) has successfully developed a nanomaterial capable of simultaneously performing cancer diagnosis, treatment, and immune response induction. Compared to conventional nanomaterials that only perform one function, this new material significantly enhances treatment efficiency and is expected to serve as a next-generation cancer therapy platform utilizing nanotechnology.

Currently, cancer treatments primarily include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. However, these treatments have significant limitations, as they not only affect cancerous areas but also cause damage to healthy tissues, leading to considerable side effects.

Cancer treatment using nanomaterials has emerged as a next-generation technology that aims to overcome the limitations of conventional treatments. By utilizing the physical and chemical properties of nanomaterials, it is possible to precisely target and deliver drugs to cancer cells and affected areas. Additionally, personalized treatments based on individual genetic profiles are now possible, offering a therapy that significantly reduces side effects while improving effectiveness compared to traditional methods.

The KRISS Nanobio Measurement Group has developed a new nanomaterial that not only allows real-time monitoring and treatment of cancerous areas but also activates the immune response system. The nanomaterial developed by the research team is a triple-layer nanodisk (AuFeAuNDs), with iron (Fe) inserted between gold (Au). The design of the nanomaterial, which features iron at the center of a disc-shaped structure, provides superior structural stability compared to traditional spherical materials. Additionally, by applying a magnet near the tumor site, the magnetic properties of the iron allow the nanomaterial to be easily attracted, further enhancing treatment efficiency.

The nanodisk developed by the research team is equipped with photoacoustic (PA) imaging capabilities, allowing for real-time observation of both the tumor's location and the drug delivery process. PA is a technique that visualizes the vibrations (ultrasound) generated by heat when light (laser) is directed at the nanodisk. By using this feature, treatment can be performed at the optimal time when the nanomaterial reaches the tumor site, maximizing its effectiveness. In fact, in animal experiments, the research team successfully tracked the accumulation of nanoparticles at the tumor site over time using PA imaging, identifying that the most effective time for treatment is 6 hours after the material is administered.

Furthermore, this nanodisk can perform three different therapeutic mechanisms in an integrated manner, which is expected to treat various types of cancer cells, unlike materials that are limited to single therapies. While conventional nanomaterials used only photothermal therapy (PTT), which involves heating gold particles to eliminate cancer cells, the nanodisk developed by the research team can also perform chemical dynamic therapy (CDT) by utilizing the properties of iron to induce oxidation within the tumor, as well as ferroptosis therapy.

After treatment, the nanodisk also induces immune response substances. The developed nanodisk prompts cancer cells to release danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) when they die, which helps the body recognize the same cancer cells and attack them if they recur. In animal experiments, the research team confirmed that the generation of warning signals through the nanodisk led to an increase in immune cell count by up to three times.

Unlike conventional nanomaterials, which are composed of a single element and perform only one function, the material developed in this study utilizes the combined properties of gold and iron to perform multiple functions.""

Drinking tea helps, but adding apples, berries, and citrus to your plate to mix up your flavonoid consumption could be the key to a longer, healthier life.

Study: High diversity of dietary flavonoid intake is associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality and major chronic diseases. Image credit: marilyn barbone/Shutterstock.com

Increased flavonoid consumption is linked to better health outcomes, but the impact of broadening the range of flavonoids has not been studied. A recent paper published in Nature Food demonstrates the health-promoting effects of consuming multiple types of flavonoids and increasing the total quantity.

Flavonoids are polyphenols in several foods, from nuts and legumes to tea and wine. Multiple flavonoid categories depend on the chemical structure, including anthocyanins, flavonols, flavon-3-ols, flavanones, and flavones.

Multiple studies show that increased flavonoid consumption from different subclasses is associated with lower incidences of chronic disease. This includes conditions like cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cancer, respiratory disease, and neurodegenerative disease.

Different flavonoids have varying types of bioactivity, depending on bioavailability and metabolism. They are potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant molecules, which may explain why they inhibit the development of chronic diseases driven by chronic inflammation and oxidative stress.

Flavonoids are also heart-protective, improving endothelial structure and function and slowing down age-related tissue deterioration by inhibiting senescence pathways. Additionally, their suppression of cell proliferation is a key mechanism in preventing cancer.

The current study sought to estimate the diversity of flavonoid intake in diet, and the associations of flavonoid intake with mortality and disease risk.

The study cohort included 124,805 UK adults aged 40 years or more, predominantly female (56%). Less than 10% smoked, but 60% were overweight or obese. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and high cholesterol was 4%, 25%, and 15%, respectively.

The median flavonoid consumption was 792 mg/day, with nine flavonoids being consumed on average daily. Flavan-3-ols were the most significant component by far, at 87%. Other categories, anthocyanins, flavonols, and flavanones, made up 4.5% each, with flavones accounting for <1%.

Black or green tea was the primary source of flavonoids, at 67%, while apples made up 6% and red wine 5%. Other sources, including grapes and berries, contributed 2%. Oranges, satsumas, orange juice, and dark chocolate each accounted for 1%. Altogether, these made up 85% of daily intake.

People with higher dietary flavonoids had less diversity overall, relying primarily on tea for their flavonoid intake. In contrast, those with a more diverse flavonoid consumption derived it from fruit and red wine. These were more likely to be women with a leaner physique, older, more physically active, and more educated.

Those with the highest flavonoid diversity had a 14% lower risk of all-cause mortality, a 10% lower risk of cardiovascular disease, and a 20% lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence. Respiratory and cancer risks were reduced by 8%. No statistically significant association was observed for neurodegenerative disease with total flavonoid diversity.

Quantitatively, compared to the lowest quintile, participants in the second quintile of flavonoid intake (about 500 mg/day) had a 16% lower risk of death from all-cause mortality. The risk of other diseases was lower by 9%-13%. The risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus was lowest in the highest quintile, 25% less than in the first quintile. For neurodegenerative disease, a 20% lower risk was observed only at the highest quintile of total flavonoid intake, not diversity.

These associations remained after adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, and other medical risk factors. Although no statistical interactions were observed between diversity and quantity (Pinteraction > 0.05), both factors independently predicted disease outcomes, suggesting that higher intakes of both contribute more than either factor alone.

In particular, an increased variety of flavan-3-ols and flavanones in the diet reduced the all-cause mortality independent of absolute intake. Quantitatively, the consumption of flavan-3-ols was linked to a stable reduction in mortality risk in the second and higher quintiles. Conversely, a lower chronic disease risk mainly appeared at the fourth or fifth quintile compared to the first.

Class-wise, the most significant reductions included a 13% lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus for flavan-3-ols and a 7% lower cancer risk for all flavanones. For flavones, an 18% lower risk of neurodegenerative disease and a 13% lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus were observed at the highest quintiles. The previously stated “75% cancer risk reduction” was not supported by the data and has been corrected.

Similar benefits were observed for diversity in flavonoid-rich foods. Having 4.5 different servings of flavonoids reduced all-cause deaths by 16% compared to 1.3 diverse servings.

The overall quantity of flavonoids consumed regularly and flavonoid diversity independently predicted mortality and disease risk. Rather than consuming one or a few flavonoids in higher amounts, it is better to include a broad variety of flavonoid-rich foods. 

Prior research on flavonoid benefits has led to the recommendation that 400-600 mg of flavan-3-ols be consumed. This recommendation could potentially be modified to include the guideline that multiple sources be included in the diet for maximum benefit. The current study's authors have developed the Flavodiet Score, which measures the number of servings of flavonoid-rich foods.

The study also used a novel approach to measuring dietary diversity: applying Hill's effective number, a metric that accounts for both the variety and proportional intake of different flavonoid compounds.

According to this study, mortality and chronic disease risk are reduced among people who had the greatest variety of flavonoids in their diet, both as foods and as specific subclasses.

These results are biologically plausible due to the known ability of different flavonoids to suppress platelet aggregation and reduce atherosclerosis risk, increase insulin sensitivity and antioxidant capacity, and inhibit inflammation. They also antagonize cancer development processes by killing tumor cells and preventing their proliferation. 

“These findings suggest that consuming several different daily servings of flavonoid-rich foods or beverages, such as tea, berries, apples, oranges or grapes, may lower risk of all-cause mortality and chronic disease.”

However, it is essential to note that this was an observational study, and while associations were strong, causation cannot be confirmed. Future studies should validate these findings and explore the sustainability of flavonoid-rich foods.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Researchers explore new therapies to prevent organ rejection without immunosuppressive drugs","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250707/Researchers-explore-new-therapies-to-prevent-organ-rejection-without-immunosuppressive-drugs.aspx","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 16:53:00 GMT","

While immunosuppressive medications are critical to prevent rejection of transplant organs, they also come with plenty of downsides. They can cause harsh side effects, like headaches and tremors, and increase the risk for infection and cancer. But what if there was a way to prevent organ rejection without using these medications?

That goal fuels the work of Mark Stegall, M.D., a longtime Mayo Clinic transplant researcher. He leads a team of researchers developing pioneering therapies to prevent organ rejection without the need for immunosuppression. A recently published study in the American Journal of Transplantation is offering hope for patients.

Mayo Clinic participated in the multisite phase 3 clinical trial detailed in the study. The goal was to see whether people who simultaneously received both a kidney and stem cell transplant from a closely matched sibling could discontinue all immunosuppressive medications after a year. The results were promising. The study found that 75% of participants were able to stop taking the medication for more than two years. At Mayo Clinic, three patients participated, with two off immunosuppression medications for over three years and one on a low dose.

I've been involved in transplant research for more than 30 years, and we've done quite a few amazing things. But in the scheme of things, this research is right at the very top. It's been a goal - to be able to safely get transplant recipients off immunosuppression - for longer than I've been doing this. We're very excited about it.""

Dr. Mark Stegall, co-author of the study

The research being done across Mayo Clinic is part of a growing trend in transplant to explore ways to use cellular therapies to prevent organ rejection. It is also a cornerstone of Mayo Clinic's Transforming Transplant Initiative, which has the bold goal of ensuring everyone who wants a transplant can get one and to make transplants more successful.

To qualify for the clinical trial, the transplant recipients and donors needed to be siblings whose tissue types closely matched. The donor agreed to donate their stem cells in addition to their kidney to their sibling. The recipient receives the transplant, undergoes radiation and then receives the stem cell transplant. The goal was to wean recipients off immunosuppression medication after a year.

For Minnesota native Mark Welter, the results have been better than he imagined. Four years ago, he needed a kidney transplant due to polycystic kidney disease, an inherited condition that causes cysts to grow on the kidneys. The Mayo Clinic patient volunteered to be a part of the clinical trial in hopes of not having to worry about immunosuppression medication the rest of his life. His younger sister Cindy Kendall immediately stepped forward to donate a kidney and her stem cells to help her brother.

""Being able to see him get off those medications has been amazing,"" Cindy says. ""He just gets to live his life to the fullest. He has been able to see both of his daughters get married and meet his grandchildren.""

Mark has not taken immunosuppression medication for more than three years.

""I feel fantastic. I actually feel like I did before the transplant, which has been the greatest thing,"" Mark says. ""It's almost like the transplant didn't happen.""

There is still plenty of work to be done to advance this research. This clinical trial only involved siblings with closely matching tissue types. Researchers want to know if stem cell transplants can prevent rejection in recipients paired with a less closely matched donor.

""Even in closely matched siblings, immunosuppression is needed lifelong. We have seen stopping medications even at eight to 10 years post-transplant leads to rejection. Our goal is to find ways to reduce or stop immunosuppressive medications after transplant so patients can have longer lasting kidneys with fewer side effects,"" says Andrew Bentall, M.B., Ch.B., M.D., a Mayo Clinic transplant nephrologist.

...

HOUSTON — For 23 fleeting minutes here at NRG Stadium on Sunday night, the U.S. men's national team was back atop CONCACAF. It was beating Mexico, 1-0, in the Gold Cup final, and rising past expectations, toward a regional summit. But in the end, it succumbed to a better team — El Tri, which came back to win 2-1 and claim Mexico's 10th Gold Cup title.

Edson Álvarez's 77th-minute goal, awarded after a dramatic VAR review, was the difference.

An hour and a half earlier, before some of 70,925 fans here could even settle into their seats, the U.S. was ahead. Patrick Agyemang won a free kick on the right. Sebastian Berhalter whipped it into the box. Chris Richards hunted it, and nodded a world-class header over Mexican goalkeeper Luis Malagón, onto the crossbar, and narrowly over the line.

For a few tense seconds, players and fans alike froze, uncertain whether the ball had fully crossed the line. But the assistant referee raised his flag. The head referee, Mario Escobar, noticed it and whistled for a goal. Richards wheeled away in celebration, with a finger to his ear, as U.S. teammates erupted.

Replays weren't definitive. CONCACAF, the regional soccer governing body that runs the Gold Cup, does not use goal-line technology, so the call was made by fallible humans on the field. Nonetheless, it was a goal, and the U.S. was buoyant.

Throughout a fascinating first half, though, Mexico's quality began to show. Álvarez, 16-year-old Gilberto Mora and Marcel Ruíz began to run the show. The U.S. struggled to cope with their movement in midfield, and struggled to get out of its defensive shell when possession changed hands.

From Richards' goal until first-half stoppage time, the Americans didn't take a single shot. They hardly got into the final third.

And in the 27th minute, Ruíz unlocked the U.S. defense. He slipped into a pocket of space at the top of the penalty box. Tyler Adams got caught between him and Alexis Vega. U.S. right back Alex Freeman got caught in “no-man's land,” and didn't recover quick enough to Ruíz. Ruíz slid a clever reverse pass to Raúl Jiménez, who finished like the most accomplished player in the field — which he was.

The U.S. stabilized over the final 10 minutes of the first half. In fact, the Americans never truly lost their footing. They limited Mexico to very few legitimate looks at goal.

But they failed to create much of anything going forward. Several players showed their inexperience under the “pressure” and “stress” that head coach Mauricio Pochettino promised this game would bring. Adams, Luca de la Torre and Berhalter lacked composure and precision. Diego Luna was overwhelmed and invisible.

Similar patterns resumed in the second half. The USMNT, with no true wingers, offered essentially zero vertical threat. Mexico pushed, gently, for a go-ahead goal — and for a while couldn't find one. Richards was dominant in the air and strong on the ground. In midfield as well, tackles began flying in. Adams was booked for crunching Álvarez.

But Álvarez got the last laugh, with his diving header off a flicked free kick.

When VAR overruled the assistant referee's offside call, the Mexican captain, and player of the tournament, sprinted half the length of the field toward green-clad fans behind the goal.

The U.S. searched for an equalizer, but didn't have the firepower to find one.

It had come a long way, from the brink of crisis to this final, but it couldn't quite clear the last — and tallest — hurdle.

Less than four weeks ago, the Americans were reeling. Half their A-team was missing. The other half headlined a depleted, makeshift, MLS-heavy squad, which arrived at the Gold Cup hounded by critics. After a 4-0 capitulation to Switzerland, their fourth straight loss, “everyone basically counted us out,” defender Tim Ream later said.

In reality, they were still the second-favorites; but among a disillusioned fan base, and among former players, doubts rippled.

In the sanctity of locker rooms and meal rooms, though, on flights and training fields, throughout their last true tournament before the 2026 World Cup, they jelled. “We have become a family, become a team,” goalkeeper Matt Freese said on the eve of the final. Richards and others also used that word, family. Ream felt like he'd added “20 more kids” to his.

And together, they strolled through Group D. They scraped past Costa Rica in a quarterfinal shootout. They survived a Guatemalan scare in the semis. They never wowed with their soccer, but they won back a skeptical public. Over 3 million people tuned into their quarterfinal, and didn't see Christian Pulisic or Weston McKennie; but did see Luna and a group of likable underdogs who, as Pochettino said, were “desperate” to “represent our country, and … fight for our flag, for our shirt.”

They came to Houston with some expectations already met. “I think there's been a lot of success this summer, with how the team's grown,” Richards said Saturday.

“But me personally,” he continued, “I like to win trophies — especially against Mexico.”

So they came with business unfinished. “We haven't proved what we want to prove yet,” Freese said. When Pochettino gathered players and staff before training this weekend, he recounted a trophy-lifting dream he'd had the night before. And he told them, per Freese: “We did not come here to be a second-place team.”

Their problem, though, was that they came with second-place talent.

They came with a six-game unbeaten streak against Mexico in official matches, but without Pulisic and McKennie, without Sergiño Dest and Antonee Robinson, without several architects of the streak, players who could equal Mexico's Álvarez and Jiménez.

And besides: “Streaks are meant to be broken,” Jiménez said Saturday in Spanish. “And we think tomorrow is a great day for us to break [this one].”

Sure enough, they broke it.

They became the first team to successfully defend a Gold Cup title since their Mexican predecessors went back-to-back in 2009 and 2011.

They will head into North America's home World Cup next summer as the outright kings of the continent once again.

HOUSTON (July 6, 2025) – The journey for the United States Men's National Team in the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup ended Sunday night with a 2-1 loss to defending champion and rival Mexico in an intense, World Cup-level tournament final in front of a sold-out crowd of 70,925 at NRG Stadium.

The result concludes a gritty, determined run for a young and relatively inexperienced USMNT roster led by first-year head coach Mauricio Pochettino.

Mexico entered Sunday's match favored as the reigning champions, though both teams reached the final after wins by one goal in the mid-week semifinals. On Wednesday, the U.S. met their toughest challenge to date and quelled a loud, pro-Guatemala crowd at Energizer Park in St. Louis with a 2-1 win. Later that night, Mexico edged out Honduras 1-0 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.

The two Concacaf forces collided in this year's final for the eighth time in Gold Cup history. Overall, the United States and Mexico have dominated the tournament, combining now to win the tournament 17 out of 18 times.

Pochettino opted for continuity with his lineup and ran out the same starting XI for the third-straight match. It was the first time the USMNT has started the same lineup in three consecutive Gold Cup knockout matches.

The USA's starting XI for the Gold Cup final was emblematic of the camp roster – profuse with rising talent and a few veterans mixed in. Tonight, five starters brought experience playing against Mexico, including midfielder Tyler Adams and captain Tim Ream, while for several players it was the first time in their international careers they faced the regional rival.

Eight of the previous 10 finals between the USMNT and Mexico across all competitions have been won by the team that scored first, so both sides started Sunday's match looking to establish themselves from the opening kick. The initial moments were nervy, given the stakes and booming noise of 70,925 in attendance.

Less than four minutes into the match, the United States opened the scoring with a combination that has been successful this tournament. Forward Patrick Agyemang drew a foul that set up a direct free kick from about 40 yards out for the United States.Midfielder Sebastian Berhalter took the kick, driving a terrific ball into the box. Center back Chris Richards judged the kick beautifully and beat his defender to direct a header on goal. The header bounced down off the underside of the crossbar and over the goal line to put the U.S. ahead 1-0 early.

It was the second time this tournament that Berhalter assisted a Richards' goal. The two previously linked up on a set piece for the lone goal against Saudi Arabia in the group stage.

Mexico slowly began to control possession as the first half progressed. In the 13th minute, goalkeeper Matt Freese, in his seventh cap and sixth straight start for the U.S., was called into action. Sixteen-year-old Gilberto Mora for Mexico fed the ball to Roberto Alvarado. The center forward's left-footed strike from the right side of the box put the first shot on target on the night for Mexico, but Freese collected for the easy save. Later in the 24th minute, Freese made his second save on a long-range, sinking shot from Mora.

Soon, the advantage in possession paid off and Mexico leveled the match in the 27th minute. After some patient buildup, midfielder Marcel Ruíz slipped a through ball inside the box to Raúl Jiménez. The striker slammed a quick-fire shot off his left foot for his second goal in as many matches. 

Mexico's possession kept the United States off the ball and without a shot since the opening goal. In the 37th minute, midfielder Malik Tillman tipped the scales of possession in favor of the U.S., breaking through Mexico's defense. The U.S. was not able to create a chance out of the stretch of possession, and minutes later the ball ended up in Mexico's half. Mora fired another long-range shot that got scarily close to slipping in below the crossbar, but Freese's long reach resulted in his fourth save of the night.

In first-half stoppage time, the U.S. nearly scored the go-ahead goal. Out of Mexico's half, Berhalter served a long ball over the top. Defender Alex Freeman, stretching the U.S. attack, ran it down on a dead sprint and headed the ball over Ángel Malagón. The Mexico goalkeeper blocked the attempt off his head, but the ball stayed in bounds. After a wild flurry, the ball ended up on the right foot of Diego Luna inside the box. Though Luna eventually skied the shot, the chance gave the U.S. a jolt of momentum heading into the halftime break.

Both sides approached the second 45 on the front foot, battling hard for loose balls and trading looks for the go-ahead goal. For Mexico, Alvarado hit a left-footed shot from outside the box that got very close to tucking into the far side netting. For the U.S., a skillful stepover move from fullback Max Arfsten set up a curling strike that sailed wide of frame.

The tension built as the two teams remained even until Mexico broke the 50-minute deadlock. Off a direct free kick from wide on the left flank, Edson Álvarez stayed onside and dove to redirect a flick from Johan Vásquez with a header of his own to give Mexico the 2-1 lead.

The U.S. pushed to find the equalizer in the dying moments of full time. The United States got close several times – including off a free kick in the 87th minute and when Agyemang broke free to receive a long ball from  Ream in second-half stoppage time. Even with a sense of urgency, the U.S. couldn't find the equalizer to hold off Mexico from winning back-to-back titles.

The match, played 340 days away from the start of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, gave the world a glimpse of the kind of competition to expect next summer. This year's Gold Cup was the last major competitive tournament for the U.S. until the World Cup comes to the U.S., Mexico and Canada, and the USMNT now heads into one of the most important moments in U.S. Soccer history battle tested.

USA – CHRIS RICHARDS (SEBASTIAN BERHALTER), 4th minute: TheUnited States opened the scoring on a set piece. Berhalter's right-footed service on a direct free kick from the right flank was slightly behind Richards, but the center back positioned himself for a header on frame 12 yards out from goal. The driven header hit the underside of the middle of the crossbar and fell downward over the goal line. USA 1, MEX 0

MEX – RAÚL JIMÉNEZ (MARCEL RUÍZ), 27th minute: Ruíz sent a through ball to Jiménez making a run inside the box. Jiménez's hit the ball hard off his left foot from about 10 yards out and stuck it into the upper back of the net to even the score. USA 1, MEX 1

MEX – EDSON ÁLVAREZ (JOHAN VÁSQUEZ), 77th minute: Mexico drew a foul on the left flank and earned a free kick from 20 yards out. Vásquez flicked the initial service toward goal, before Álvarez drove his header into the back of the net from six yards out. USA 1, MEX 2 FINAL.

Straight Arrow News


				The USMNT dropped a 2-1 decision to Mexico in the Gold Cup final match Sunday, July 6.			


				The U.S. had some pointed comments about the officiating after some controversial calls in the second half.			


				The U.S. made progress, winning five matches despite missing some of their biggest stars during the tournament.			

The U.S. men's national soccer team did not want their July 4th holiday weekend to end with a loss, but the experience gained could be more valuable down the road. The 2-1 loss to Mexico in the CONCACAF Gold Cup tournament final was still a springboard to next summer's World Cup.

The U.S brought their backup players to the tournament, but that didn't stop them from having an outstanding run to the final match. Midfielder Tyler Adams said that after a month playing together, the group of younger players felt like a family.

“We got so close over these five weeks,” Adams said. “So many guys sacrificed so much to be here, spend time away from their families, spend time away from their clubs and come together.”

On the pitch, the Americans scored the first goal Sunday, July 6, and looked to be in good form. Mexico answered later in the first half to take the match to halftime even at one goal apiece. There were some controversial moments in the second half, including a clear handball by a Mexican player that should have been a penalty kick for the U.S. The referee said it wasn't intentional and thus didn't call the foul, but U.S. head coach Mauricio Pochettino didn't hold back in the post-match press conference. 

“It's not about to cry, it's not about to complain, it's not about to put excuses for different things,” Pochettino said. “But I think we can continue talking, for me it was embarrassing to see in that situation. It's a shame.”

The game-winning goal by Mexico was also frustrating for Pochettino and his players. The header by Edson Álvarez was initially disallowed for offside, but after a VAR review the goal was deemed good.

Controversy aside, after four consecutive losses in friendly matches heading into the tournament, the U.S. completely turned things around over the last few weeks. They won three Gold Cup group stage matches and then two elimination matches to make it to the final. The team did it all without their best players, who sat out the tournament for various reasons. Pochettino believes the younger players who got a chance to shine have discovered their identity. 

“The most important thing is to have our heads up because I think the tournament was fantastic,” Pochettino said. “I think we need to keep going. That is the way we want to be in the World Cup. In this way, I have no doubt we are going to be really, really competitive.”  

Adding established national team stars like Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Antonee Robinson and Sergiño Dest can only help next summer. They, along with several other USMNT regulars, decided to skip the Gold Cup to rest or play for their professional clubs.

On June 8, former Team USA legend and now soccer analyst Landon Donovan called out those stars for skipping the Gold Cup tournament, saying they needed to take more pride in playing for their country. He had a more positive spin Sunday night after the loss.

“To get to the final and put in a really good effort against a good Mexico team was a positive,” Donovan said. “Although it hurts to lose, we don't ever take solace in losing, but I think it was a big stepping stone for this team.”  

The U.S. will have two friendly matches in September, against South Korea and Japan, to see where their progress stands before learning their World Cup draw in December. The question is how Pochettino will reintegrate those big-time stars into a group that took several steps without them over the last month. 

Pochettino didn't want to talk about the missing guys Sunday night, saying he wasn't going to make excuses. He added that he and his staff were “people that are very open, the players that deserve to be on the team” will be there next summer.


The outcome of the U.S. men's national soccer team's performance in the CONCACAF Gold Cup final highlights both current squad development and crucial questions about team composition and preparation ahead of the World Cup.

The tournament allowed less-experienced players to gain international exposure and fostered a sense of unity within the squad, which was noted by players such as Tyler Adams.

The absence of several key players who chose to skip the tournament raised discussions, including criticism and analysis from former players like Landon Donovan, about commitment and future reintegration.

Contested refereeing decisions, especially regarding a denied penalty claim and the VAR-reviewed game-winning goal, were called out by head coach Mauricio Pochettino as points of frustration and potential impact on the final match outcome.

World Cup

HOUSTON — For all of his experiences managing at some of the world's biggest clubs, Mauricio Pochettino spent this summer learning on the fly.

The Concacaf Gold Cup was the first time the U.S. men's national team coach managed an international tournament, one with a full group-to-knockout-stage cadence that can theoretically simulate the World Cup experience. There's no doubt Pochettino will take away plenty from the 36 days he spent with this team: in how he thinks about building a roster, the chemistry needed in the group and even the logistics around a month-long competition. The U.S. logged about 7,500 miles traveling to nine cities: Chicago, East Hartford, Nashville, San Jose, Austin, Dallas, Minneapolis, St. Louis and Houston. Pochettino's side played eight games, with opponents ranging from 17th-ranked Mexico and 20th-ranked Switzerland to 106th-ranked Guatemala.

“It's a good experience to be able to feel what it means to be constantly traveling … I think we're learning a lot,” Pochettino reflected last week ahead of the semifinal. “We're also learning a lot from the players, the group and the staff. It's an experience that will be very useful to us as we prepare for the World Cup.”

Pochettino got plenty out of a group of players that was not the team many envisioned he would be coaching this summer (or envision he will be coaching next summer, for that matter). The U.S. ultimately fell 2-1 to Mexico in the Gold Cup final, but there was belief around the team that it had developed a better understanding of the mentality and identity needed for the team to be successful at the World Cup.

Perhaps more importantly, the players involved in the Gold Cup said they started to get a better understanding of the coaches themselves. Since arriving last October, Pochettino and his staff had very little time with the player pool. Players would arrive and have a recovery session and one training session, then play a game; then have another recovery session and one or two training sessions before the next game. Then everyone would fly home.

This summer gave the group extended time together.

“We talked about from from day one, this being an opportunity for a lot of guys, myself included, it was an opportunity to to grow as as players, but (also) grow as people, to create a culture and a togetherness that that we've maybe lacked in a lot of moments in the past six months to a year,” U.S. center back Tim Ream said. “That's what's been driven home (by the coaching staff), and that is what has been created. The way they treat each staff member, the way they treat each player, whether they're first on the starting 11, or if they haven't played a minute. The treatment of everybody is the exact same.

“I love being able to sit back and watch interactions. And their interactions with everybody is just, it's so impressive. His entire staff, the interactions that they have with players, they know when it's time to be serious and they know when it's time to put an arm around a guy. They know when it's time to poke a guy to get the best out of them, and they know when it's time to have a little laugh and a joke. And I think that's a sign of a great manager, when they can see when those moments are necessary and what those moments call for. And it's been probably the most impressive thing to see with all his staff.”

Those interactions ultimately are what build chemistry and understanding within a group. It's one of the challenges of the timing around Pochettino's hire. Pochettino had two years to try to get to know his player pool, figure out what drives them and then unlock more. It is a sprint to get it all done before the 2026 World Cup kicks off.

Many of these players have been together since 2019 helping to rebuild a program that missed the 2018 World Cup. In the lead up to the 2022 World Cup, the chemistry of the group was considered one of the strengths. That familiarity, though, started to feel too much like comfort in the last year. The Copa América exit set off alarm bells and prompted U.S. Soccer leadership to fire then-coach Gregg Berhalter. Pochettino's job was to shake things up, to create competition and push the group to get better. In a way, this goal around this summer was to find players that could challenge the “core” of this U.S. team and make them feel that it's no guarantee they'll be called into every U.S. camp.

It is not easy to inject that mentality into the group while simultaneously building trust. For some of the veterans in camp, the biggest benefit of this summer was the latter part of the equation.

“I learned not just the players, but the coaching staff better,” said center back Chris Richards, who emerged as a more vocal leader at the Gold Cup. “They kind of come off as intimidating when you first come into camp, because they have such a good CV. They've coached some of the best players in the world. That can be a little bit intimidating. But then once you finally get to meet them, you understand that they're all just big teddy bears, and they all really care about family. That's been the No. 1 thing that they've stressed all camp long. That's been the biggest thing that I've learned from them, is that I know we are a big family, and we're all going to fight for each other. … One of the biggest things that we kind of learned this summer is that the coaching staff and players are starting to really understand each other.”

While Pochettino undoubtedly got significant value in team building and camaraderie this summer, it may have been more important how he came to understand roster building and depth for a tournament.

Pochettino leaned on the same starting XI for all three knockout games at the Gold Cup. It was clear he found the players he trusted the most, even just for this competition. But it also called into question the depth of the group and his talent assessment. In some ways, the team he had this summer was out of his hands. Beyond the many players who were unavailable, several players originally summoned for the tournament left due to injury, including Sergiño Dest, Haji Wright, Folarin Balogun and Zack Steffen. Injuries in camp limited minutes for Damion Downs and Johnny Cardoso.

But Pochettino's decision to leave off some players who had been involved in the Nations League camp and other competitions hurt the quality and depth of the squad in this tournament. Players like Tanner Tessmann, Joe Scally, Alejandro Zendejas and Josh Sargent undoubtedly would have improved this team's matchday flexibility.

There was a balance between sending a message to the player pool and picking the best possible squad to maximize performance. When it comes time to the World Cup, Pochettino will have to hope that the messages he sent were received, because he'll need every ounce of competition and depth, without sacrificing quality.

At bare minimum, he should now have a much better idea of the level of the player pool top to bottom.

On Sunday after the game, Pochettino wasn't quite ready to talk about the players who weren't there. He seemed a bit thrown by a question about how to integrate some of the regulars who weren't there this summer back into the team.

“You already made the list?” Pochettino responded when asked about reintegrating players like Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Antonee Robinson and Dest. “Or you ask artificial intelligence and you do the roster for next time?”

“I don't understand that question. Because for different [reasons], we have the roster that we have. All the American players have the possibility for September to be on the roster. It's up to us now to analyze, but all the names you told me, all are under scrutiny, and we are following them.

“It's still one year from the World Cup. But now we need to build a roster for September. And yes, we need to analyze every single player, see the circumstances, the situations, performance, fitness level. Don't worry. We are people that are very open, and not closed. And who deserves to be (there) will be (there).”

The answer hinted that there is no guarantee that every “regular” will be back with the group in September. Pochettino's overarching message from this Gold Cup was about valuing every call-up and taking the job seriously. Richards said there were “a few non-negotiables now.” Anything short of those foundational standards will leave you on the outside looking in.

Asked Sunday how to carry the togetherness and mentality gained this summer into the full group this fall, U.S. midfielder Tyler Adams was blunt.

“If I'm being honest, I think it has to translate right away, or I think Mauricio probably just won't call people in,” Adams said. “Because the culture that we have, it doesn't matter who you are, if it's guys here that played well, if it's guys coming back into the group, if you're coming back from injury – whatever it is, the culture and the emotion is the first thing that [Pochettino] wants to see.

“And I think that's gonna lead to positive results.”

If that's the lasting legacy of this Gold Cup, it will have been a successful first international tournament for Pochettino – even if it ended without a trophy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Gold Cup Run Provides ‘Massive Lesson' For Mauricio Pochettino, USMNT","https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2025/07/gold-cup-takeaways-head-coach-mauricio-pochettino-usmnt-vs-mexico","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 04:52:02 GMT","

United States Men's National Team head coach Mauricio Pochettino started the press conference after his team's 2-1 loss in the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup Final by congratulating the victors, Mexico, not just once but twice – in both English and Spanish.

The head coach was a good sport fresh off leaving the pitch where his team lost to the their biggest rival in a Cup final. In a match deemed World Cup caliber because of its intensity, high level of competition and setting, a United States lineup that averaged just 23 caps gave the defending champions a run for their money. The U.S. started fast, opening the scoring in the fourth minute. As the match continued, Mexico climbed back to tie it up, then broke a 50-minute deadlock with the game-winner in the second half.

The result put the U.S. one win away from a trophy, and one win away from Pochettino's first title since being named USMNT head coach in September 2024, a fact the manager acknowledged as “very painful.” But even though his team came up short on the night, Pochettino's outlook, like his introduction, was positive and focused on building.

“It's a massive lesson for us,” Pochettino said. “What I've seen is priceless. It was an amazing tournament to realize the way that we want to grow... I think we're going to find the way to compete better and better and better, to be very competitive and be in the place we wanted to be.”

Lessons learned from this tournament start with the depth of the squad. Heading into the Gold Cup, the USMNT was missing several mainstays. The 26-player roster averaged only 16 caps entering the tournament, just eight in official competition.

The starting XI that took the pitch Sunday against 17th-ranked Mexico reflected the makeup of the roster. Only five starters had faced Mexico before. For several players, it marked the first time seeing the regional rival in their international careers.

This tournament gave players quality experience on a big stage. It also allowed Pochettino, in his first year as head coach, to get to know his players more during this 40-day camp and see what they're capable of on the pitch. When looking at the entirety of the tournament run, the United States witnessed several breakout performances:

Another takeaway from the tournament is the overall results. The United States completed group play unbeaten, winning all three matches while conceding just one goal. In the knockout stage, the U.S. faced two tough opponents, Costa Rica and Guatemala – one in a penalty kick shootout and one in a particularly loud and hostile environment. The U.S. prevailed both times to advance, showing tremendous fight and poise, and clear a path toward the program's 13th Gold Cup Final.

“I am so proud about the team,” Pochettino said. “Keep going, keep fighting, keep pushing. One year to the World Cup, too many positives even to take.”

The Gold Cup was the last competitive tournament for the United States before the FIFA World Cup kicks off next summer. Tonight's match marked 340 days until the World Cup comes to the United States, Mexico and Canada. Sunday night's environment gave the world a taste of what next summer will be like – NRG Stadium, where tonight's Gold Cup Final was held, is one of America's World Cup venues in 2026.

As one of the host countries next summer, the United States will want to perform well and make a deep run. If the Gold Cup is any indicator, the United States is sure to be competitive and bring a deep squad when the world's biggest soccer tournament arrives on American soil.

“The most important thing is to have our head up because I think the tournament was fantastic,” he said. “Keep going. That is the way that we want to build our journey to the World Cup. In this way, I have no doubt that we are going to be really, really competitive and going to be difficult for the opponent.”

We look ahead to this
semi-final at the 2025 Club World
Cup with our Fluminense vs Chelsea prediction and preview. Can
the Brazilians cause another upset in New Jersey?

It's time for the semi-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup, and
this game features the only remaining non-European team in the
competition.

Fluminense have done brilliantly to reach the final four, coming
through their group before beating Internazionale in the last 16
and Al-Hilal in the quarter-finals.

Matheus Martinelli gave the Brazilian side the lead against
their Saudi opponents before Marcos Leonardo equalised early in the
second half. However, Hércules came off the bench to score the
winner with 20 minutes remaining, sparking scenes of jubilation
from Fluminense on the final whistle.

They come up against Chelsea,
who defeated Benfica and Palmeiras in the knockout stages to get
this far.

The Blues were made to work for it, with future Chelsea player
Estêvão equalising after Cole
Palmer had given the Premier
League side an early lead. An own goal from Agustín Giay
decided it with just seven minutes left, though.

The only previous time Fluminense have played English opposition
in the Club World Cup was their 4-0 defeat to Manchester City in
the 2023 final.

However, they come into this game in excellent form. Their 2-1
win over Al-Hilal in the last eight extended their unbeaten run in
all competitions to 11 matches (W8 D3). In fact, Leonardo's
equaliser came in the 51st minute, which was the first goal
Fluminense had conceded in the second half of a match since 18 May,
ending a run of eight straight second-half shutouts.

That has been in part down to the continued brilliance of Thiago
Silva, still performing to a high standard even though he turns 41
in September. The Brazil legend will be aiming to stop his former
side on Tuesday at MetLife Stadium.

Jhon Arias will be someone for Chelsea to watch out for. He
created five chances against Al-Hilal, his second match with at
least five chances created in this year's competition (six vs
Ulsan). He also made three line-breaking passes that broke the
defensive line, more than any other player in the game.

Chelsea have had mixed fortunes against Brazilian opponents.
This will be their third match against Brazilian teams in this
year's Club World Cup, after a 3-1 loss to Flamengo in the group
stage and a 2-1 win over Palmeiras in the quarter-finals.

Enzo Maresca has plenty of quality to call on, but it's
difficult to look past Palmer as the main threat. The England
international scored his first goal of the tournament in the
quarter-final, becoming the 10th Englishman to score in this
edition of the competition.

Chelsea's Pedro
Neto has impressed at this tournament, and is one of only three
players with 10+ successful dribbles and 10+ chances created, along
with Arias and Man City's Savinho.

Chelsea are heavy favourites to reach the final of the Club
World Cup, doing so in 81.3% of the Opta supercomputer's 10,000
pre-match simulations. Fluminense only did so 18.7% of the
time.

The Premier League side won inside 90 minutes in 69.1% of sims,
compared to the Brazilians' 12.8%. The game went to extra-time and
potentially penalties in the remaining 18.1%.

Never say never, but the supercomputer is not backing Fluminense
to win the whole tournament. 
The latest simulations see them do so just 2.4% of the time,
while Chelsea (34.1%) are now second favourites behind Paris
Saint-Germain (38.9%).

Jannik Sinner suffered a potentially damaging fall in the early stages of his fourth-round clash with Grigor Dimitrov at Wimbledon, where he trails the Bulgarian 3-6, 5-7.

In the first game of the match, the top-seeded Sinner attempted to reach a deep backhand and subsequently fell to the ground, landing on his extended right arm. The 23-year-old then dropped his serve for the first time in the campaign in the ensuing game and took a medical timeout to receive treatment after five games of the second set.



Sinner had reached the fourth round at Wimbledon for the loss of just 17 games — equalling the Open Era record set by Jan Kodes in 1972 — but he was put under extreme pressure by Dimitrov in the early stages. The Bulgarian dropped just three of 34 service points in the first set, and caused havoc with his craft and guile, often executing slice and drop shots.

Due to the fading light, the roof on Centre Court was closed after the second set, adding a delay of approximately 10 minutes.

The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Sinner is aiming to reach the quarter-finals at Wimbledon for the fourth consecutive year. He has come back to win from two sets down twice in his career, including in the 2024 Australian Open final against Daniil Medvedev. The Italian, who has not failed to reach the quarter-finals at a major since the 2023 US Open, owns a 6-10 record in five-set matches.

Sinner leads Dimitrov 4-1 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series, but this marks their first meeting on grass. Dimitrov, the 2017 Nitto ATP Finals champion, is aiming to defeat a World No. 1 for the second time in his career and reach the quarter-finals at Wimbledon for the first time since 2014.

With his 101st singles win at Wimbledon on Monday, Novak Djokovic advanced to his 16th quarter-final at the grass-court Grand Slam and moved within four victories of equalling Roger Federer's record 105 match wins at the event. The Swiss legend was on hand for Djokovic's 1-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 triumph against Alex de Minaur, after which the Serbian paid homage to the eight-time Wimbledon champion.

""It's probably the first time he's watching me and I've won the match,"" Djokovic said in his on-court interview. ""In the last couple, I lost the match, so it's good to break the curse.

""It's great to have Roger here, a huge champion and someone I admired and respected a lot. We've shared the stage for so many years and it's great to have him back in his most successful and favourite tournament, no doubt.""

De Minaur pushed Djokovic hard on Centre Court, with the Aussie racing through the opening set and leading 4-1 in the fourth with a break point for 5-1.

""It was a very difficult encounter, some very challenging moments for me,"" Djokovic said, before referencing Federer in the stands. ""Sometimes, I wish I had a serve and volley and a nice touch from the gentleman who is standing right there. That would help,"" he joked.

Djokovic was all too familiar with the singular skills of the Swiss. Their 50 Lexus ATP Head2Head matchups are the second most of any rivals in ATP Tour history, second only to Djokovic and Rafael Nadal (59).

 Moving house can be stressful at the best of times. 

 For Flavio Cobolli, a forced change of accommodation unexpectedly disrupted his fortnight at Wimbledon, but the Italian remains alive at the grass major after he overcame Marin Cilic 6-4, 6-4, 6-7(4), 7-6(3) to reach his first major quarter-final.

 ""Now I'm really emotional because this is a day that I never forget, for sure,"" said Cobolli in his post-match press conference. ""I played a really good match today.

 Unable to stay longer at the house he rented for the start of the grass-court major, Cobolli had been on the hunt for new digs, ideally not too far from the All England Club, ahead of his third-round clash with Jakub Mensik. 

 “[I had] to move house. The lady didn't renew our contract,” Cobolli, who had also struggled to sleep in his original accommodation as a heatwave hit London, told Eurosport in Italian before his Saturday meeting with Mensik. “We didn't complain... We didn't have anything to deal with the heat, but I spoke to many players, and the situation is the same for everyone. 

 “It wasn't a problem with the house, but when you find yourself unable to sleep like I did, you always try to find a solution. But now she's kicked us out and we hope to find a house. The hotels, they're far away here. I went to dinner in Chelsea, it took me an hour and twenty minutes. A hotel is the last resort."" 



 Cobolli's house-search was ultimately successful, and the change of base has done nothing to halt his winning charge at SW19. After defeating Mensik in straight sets, the 23-year-old on Monday overcame Cilic 6-4, 6-4, 6-7(4), 7-6(3) to set a last-eight meeting with seven-time champion Novak Djokovic. 

 “I had some problems with my first house, but now I found a great solution,” Cobolli told ATPTour.com after defeating Cilic. “I slept well. I have a great relationship with the guy that I rent the apartment. Now I'm in good shape.” 

 Competing at a career-high No. 24 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Cobolli has enjoyed a personal-best season in 2025. He lifted his first two ATP Tour trophies in Bucharest and Hamburg, respectively, and he is up five spots to No. 19 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings as a result of his Wimbledon run so far. 

 The scenes after Cobolli completed his victory against Cilic, during which the Italian converted three of eight points he earned against the big-serving Croatian, were emotional. Cobolli's father and coach, Stefano Cobolli, shed tears in the stands on No. 2 Court.

 “It is something that I dreamt of since when I was young, since when I started to play tennis,” reflected Cobolli in his post-match press conference. “Everyone in my family, on my team, told me every day that I was born to play matches like this because they saw me really cold, electric on the court. They always told me that I live for this kind of match. 

 “I think it is true because I really love to play against a big player, against a legend of our sport. I like to play on this kind of stage, this kind of tournament. I really love to play here in Wimbledon. I love to play on grass.”

Novak Djokovic recovered from a slow start on Monday at Wimbledon, where he battled past Alex de Minaur 1-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to reach the quarter-finals in London for the 16th time.

Last year, De Minaur was forced to withdraw ahead of his quarter-final clash against Djokovic at SW19 due to a hip injury sustained late in his fourth-round win against Arthur Fils.

The Australian dropped just one set en route to the fourth round this year to ensure he would have a crack at Djokovic but he was once again left frustrated. The 26-year-old rolled through the first set but failed to convert break point opportunities when trailing 4-5 in the second set, with Djokovic crucially holding to level. The Serbian limited errors from the baseline and moved the Australian from side to side to lead before he rallied from 1-4 in the fourth set to advance after three hours and 18 minutes.

""I am still trying to process the whole match and what happened on court,"" Djokovic said. ""It wasn't a great start for me, it was a great start for him. He broke my serve three times in the first set. Very windy, swirly conditions on the court. He was just managing better with the play from the back of the court.

""I didn't have many solutions but I managed to reset myself. It was kind of a tough game to close out the second set. Perhaps that was a momentum shift where I just felt like 'OK, I am back in the game'. It was a lot of cat-and-mouse play, a lot of slices and he is so good at it. He is one of the quickest players we have on the Tour and on grass where the ball bounces so low, it is extremely difficult to play someone like him if you are not feeling the ball really well. He exposes all your weaknesses and I was pleased to hang in tough in the right moments.""

Djokovic defeated countryman Miomir Kecmanovic in the third round to notch his 100th match win at Wimbledon, with only record eight-time champion Roger Federer (105) earning more victories in the men's singles.

With win 101, Djokovic improved to 25-8 on the season and moved to within three victories of a record-extending 25th major. If he wins the title, he will equal Federer's record of eight crowns at the grass-court major. The former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings Federer was watching his former rival from the Royal Box on Monday.

""It was a very difficult encounter, some very challenging moments for me. Sometimes, I wish I had a serve and volley and a nice touch from the gentleman who is standing right there, that would help,"" Djokovic said with a smile, acknowledging Federer.



Djokovic will next meet Italian Flavio Cobolli after the 22nd seed downed Marin Cilic 6-4, 6-4, 6-7(4), 7-6(3) to reach the quarter-finals at Wimbledon for the first time.

De Minaur was aiming to advance to the quarter-finals at a major for the sixth time. The World No. 11 soaked up Djokovic's groundstrokes with his clean ballstriking and demonstrated quick foot speed to track down the Serbian's drop shots. However, he was unable to hurt the former World No. 1 enough and faded quickly from 4-1 ahead in the fourth set. Djokovic, who has dropped just two sets this fortnight, now leads the Australian 3-1 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

The second grand slam of the year is ongoing at Roland-Garros. The 2025 French Open has reached the men's semifinals. Defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz has made it through to the semis. Defending champ Iga Swiatek was knocked out in her semis match by the top seed of the women's tournament, Aryna Sabalenka — who will face No. 2 Coco Gauff in the women's final this Saturday. In the U.S., coverage of this year's tournament is airing on TNT and truTV, and every match is streaming live on HBO Max.

Are you ready to watch the men's semis at the French Open? Here's how to follow all the action down on the clay courts at Roland-Garros.

Dates: May 25 - June 8

Time: Play starts daily at 5 a.m. ET

Location: Stade Roland-Garros

TV channel: TNT, truTV

Streaming: HBO Max

The 2025 French Open will take place between May 25 and June 8. Singles play begins May 25, with the men's final closing things out on June 8.

Thanks to the time difference between the U.S. and France, the tennis tournament at Roland-Garros will start daily play at 5 a.m. ET/3 a.m. PT.

In a shift from last year, the 2025 Roland-Garros tennis tournament will air across TNT and truTV — with all matches streaming on Max (soon to be officially re-named HBO Max).

Disney

The Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle gets you exactly what it sounds like: access to Disney+, Hulu and Max. If you go ad-free ($29.99/month) you'll save up to 38% off compared to individually paying for all three services — and gain access to all French Open coverage. 

If you don't already have access to these platforms, this is a great option that really covers your bases, streaming-wise. You'll get access to three vast libraries, fully stocked with everything MCU, all those Disney princesses (new and old), Hulu's robust catalog of shows on-demand the day after they air, including the latest episodes of Abbott Elementary, Grey's Anatomy and more, and the most recent seasons of The Last of Us, The Pitt and White Lotus.

 

While Sling doesn't offer a free trial these days, the tournament will last longer than any free trial anyway. With Sling Blue, you can get access to French Open coverage on TNT and truTV. 

Sling also has an option to bundle Max in with your Sling Orange + Blue subscription and save $5 on the overall price, in case you want to watch games via Max and take advantage of all the channels offered in the Sling Orange + Blue combo package. 

If you want to catch every match of the French Open and don't currently subscribe to HBO Max or a live TV streaming service, in Australia a majority of the action is streaming free with ads on 9Now, and in Austria it's all streaming free with ads on ServusTV.

Don't live in either of those places? Don't worry, you can still stream like you do with the help of a VPN. A VPN (virtual private network) helps protect your data, can mask your IP address and is perhaps most popular for being especially useful in the age of streaming. Whether you're looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to next F1 race without a cable package, a VPN can help you out. Looking to try a VPN for the first time? This guide breaks down the best VPN options for every kind of user.

 

ExpressVPN offers “internet without borders,” meaning you can tune into an Austrian or Australian livestream this month as opposed to paying for another streaming subscription. All you'll need to do is sign up for ExpressVPN, change your server location and then find free livestream coverage on 9Now or ServusTV. 

ExpressVPN's added protection, speed and range of location options make it an excellent choice for first-time VPN users looking to stretch their streaming abilities, plus, it's Engadget's top pick for the best streaming VPN. New users can save 61% when they sign up for ExpressVPN's 2-year subscription. Plus, the service offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, in case you're nervous about trying a VPN.

SPOTLIGHT

The world's most iconic streetball tournament, Quai 54, made a powerful return this Saturday, opening in spectacular fashion at the historic Roland-Garros stadium. Traditionally home to tennis royalty, the Parisian venue transformed into an electrifying arena where basketball, hip-hop, and street culture collided most boldly.

Founded in 2003 by Hammadoun Sidibé and Thibaut de Longeville, Quai 54 has evolved from humble outdoor courts into a global celebration of sport and urban identity. Named after a local Paris bus stop — “Quai 54” — the event has grown into a world-class cultural phenomenon, previously held at iconic locations like the Trocadéro and now, Roland-Garros.



Each edition brings together elite basketball talent, top DJs, dancers, and artists, creating an unmatched blend of athleticism, music, and community energy.

This year's opening carried profound emotional weight. Held on July 5, it marked the 50th anniversary of Cape Verde's independence, turning the tournament's opening day into a powerful tribute to the island nation's resilience, pride, and cultural spirit.

The team representing Cape Verde, Team Hello Cabo Verde, hit the court as part of the Cabo Verde Sports Festival — the country's first national initiative fusing sports, education, and tourism. Running from July to October 2025, the festival spotlights Cape Verdean talent both on the islands and across the diaspora.

The moment was set with the soulful performance of the Cape Verdean national anthem by Lucyle Cruz, followed by a mesmerizing batuku dance — a traditional rhythm deeply rooted in Cape Verdean heritage. The stadium pulsed in unity, a shared heartbeat between players, fans, and performers.



Among those lighting up the court was William Tavares, younger brother to NBA and Real Madrid star Edy Tavares. His presence at Quai 54 was more than symbolic — it was personal.

“For me, it was priceless to be here for the first time,” he said post-game, visibly moved. “To do it on a day that means so much to Cape Verdeans… It meant everything. I'm still shaking, honestly. It was an incredible feeling.”

Tavares, currently exploring professional opportunities, brought both heart and hustle to the floor.

“I'm a 4 or 5 who can shoot and dribble. I can play like a big one, but I'm comfortable with the ball. The game just comes to me — I go with the flow.”

When asked about the uniqueness of Quai 54, his face lit up:

“It's something special. The people, the vibe, the atmosphere — it's all love. It felt amazing just being here.”

For Tavares, basketball is deeply intertwined with family and identity. He began playing to protect his brother:

“I started because I wanted to shield Edy. Watching him go through struggles made me want to stand beside him. Then I fell in love with the game — and it's been joy ever since.”

His long-term goal is crystal clear:



“My dream is to take Cape Verde as far as possible — and grow, both as a player and as a man.”

Now in its 22nd edition, Quai 54 proves once again that it's far more than just a tournament. It's a cultural movement — a global celebration of excellence, identity, and connection.

And on July 5, the court became a canvas — where Cape Verde shone with pride, rhythm, and purpose. From the streets of Praia to the heart of Paris, the world witnessed what it means to play — and live — with soul.

Novak Djokovic overcame a slow start to defeat Alex de Minaur in the Round of 16 at Wimbledon on Monday. 

Djokovic dropped the first set of the match before he ultimately moved one step closer to his eighth Wimbledon title with a 1-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 win over de Minaur. 

Now, he's set to face Flavio Cobolli in the quarterfinals. 

Djokovic didn't start Monday on a high note, as his serve was broken in the first game of the match. Three break points were converted by de Minaur in the opening set, as the 24-time Grand Slam champion dealt with several double faults in the windy conditions.

Djokovic got back on track in the second set, taking an early 3-1 lead. He eventually held a 5-4 advantage during the set, although de Minaur fought back to force a break point. He was ultimately unable to convert, as Djokovic avoided potentially being down by two sets.

He took the third set 6-4, but ran into trouble once again to begin the fourth. De Minaur earned another break and held serve, taking a 4-1 lead following a volley that hit the net from the 38-year-old.

Djokovic quickly responded, though. He ended the match by winning each of the final five games, advancing to the quarterfinals with a backhand winner.

He finished with six aces compared to just one for de Minaur. Djokovic also converted six of 13 break points, while de Minaur struggled following his success in the opening set. He converted six of 19 break points.

Djokovic gave a shoutout to fellow tennis legend Roger Federer, who was in attendance, after the match concluded.

Djokovic has now advanced to the quarterfinals at Wimbledon for the 16th time in his career and will face Cobolli on Wednesday.","{'href': 'https://bleacherreport.com', 'title': 'Bleacher Report'}","tennis"

After Novak Djokovic saw off Alex de Minaur, Jannik Sinner takes on Grigor Dimitrov as the fourth round continues

We're into the second week of Wimbledon 2025, as the fourth round continues and sees major names take to the grass.

The first players out on Centre Court on Monday were Novak Djokovic, who continues his bid for a record-equalling eighth title in SW19, and Alex de Minaur, with Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek set to be in action later.

Djokovic saw off 11th seed Alex de Minaur in four sets, losing the first in short order in a shocking episode, before fighting back to eliminate the Aussie. Djokovic, 38, also played down injury concerns despite clutching his stomach throughout, having suffered a stomach issue in round one.

Sinner will take to the same court to play Grigor Dimitrov, while Swiatek – like Sinner – continues to pursue a first Wimbledon title, but on No 1 Court. Five-time major winner Swiatek is through to the quarter-finals after a 6-4 6-1 win over Denmark's Clara Tauson in just 65 minutes. 

Follow all the latest tennis updates, scores and results from Wimbledon below.

How it all changed in a moment. Grigor Dimitrov was beating Jannik Sinner and deservedly so. But his Wimbledon is over. 

Sinner goes to Dimitrov and embraces his stricken opponent. He has torn his pectoral muscle and is out of Wimbledon in the cruelest of circumstances. 

Jannik Sinner is through but he has not won tonight and admits so himself. The World No 1 will play Ben Shelton in the quarter-finals. 

Oh my goodness. Your heart just breaks for Grigor Dimitrov. He returns to court but shakes his head and retires from his match while two sets up against Jannik Sinner. Extraordinary. 

More follows

Dimitrov seems to be in a real state, mentally, and who can blame him?

Sinner has come over again, checking on Dimitrov as the physios do the same.

Dimitrov, it seems, will continue – but only after leaving the court for now.

Dimitrov holds serve to make it 2-2, then drops to the grass on his backside, clutching his chest.

He seems to be struggling with a pectoral issue, perhaps? Sinner comes over to check on him, as do a couple of trainers...

Back underway on Centre Court, where Sinner does what he failed to manage in the first two sets and wins his opening service game of the set. Sinner does not have the best record in long matches, or in five-sets in general at the grand slams, but he can start improving that by coming from behind against Dimitrov. 

At this point, it's a long way to go, though. 

Sinner 3-6 5-7 1-0 Dimitrov*

At the third attempt, Grigor Dimitrov wins the set to take a 2-0 lead over Jannik Sinner! Incredible. This has been a vintage performance from the 34-year-old, and certainly a below-par display from the World No 1, who has been struggling with an elbow injury. 

The Italian will need to come from two sets down, and from under the roof on Centre Court. The roof is closing and Sinner is heading off court to clear his head. 

*Sinner 3-6 5-7 Dimitrov

Who saw this twist coming after Sinner stayed alive? Dimitrov plays a sensational return game and breaks straight back! The Bulgarian will have the second opportunity to serve for the set... 

Sinner 3-6 5-6 Dimitrov*

With Grigor Dimitrov serving for the set, Jannik Sinner breaks for the first time in the match and roars at his box! The ice-man brings some fire to Centre Court as he avoids going two sets down. Big moment. 

*Sinner 3-6 5-5 Dimitrov

Home hope's ‘annoying' antics have irked opponents

‘That's my energy,' Norrie admits before quarter-final

Cameron Norrie said he relishes playing Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon quarter-finals on Tuesday and will continue to compete with the competitive energy that has driven his success, regardless of what other people think.

“I'm excited to play against him and I'm going to have to play my best level, and even better, to have a chance because he's got such a diverse game,” Norrie said. “I'm going to have to be tough and bring more energy to have a chance.”

Norrie reached the quarter-finals by holding his nerve in a bruising five-set battle with the Chilean qualifier Nicolás Jarry on Sunday. Jarry complained afterwards to Norrie about his tendency to cheer loudly after most points. “He said I was a little bit vocal and I think: ‘That's my energy,'” Norrie said.

The competitive drive and relentless positivity that the left‑hander displays have been key factors in his success over the years. Some players, however, are less enthused by opponents who cheer their unforced errors or after less important points. Asked last week about the impact of the crowd on their second-round match, Frances Tiafoe focused immediately on Norrie's cheering: “He was super‑amped,” Tiafoe said. “He was saying ‘c'mon' from the first game, which is definitely annoying, but that part bothered me more than the crowd.”

Norrie also tends to encourage himself in French and Spanish, which led to a tense moment with the Spaniard Roberto Carballés Baena in Metz last November after the British player recovered to seal a three-set win: “You say ‘vamos!' all the time, looking right in my face,” Carballes Baena said. Norrie then offered a self-deprecating response: “A couple of ‘vamoses' and you get pissed off?” he said. “I'm playing so bad, so I had to fire myself up.”

As he looked to his upcoming match against Alcaraz, Norrie, 29, took these criticisms in his stride: “[When] a couple of people have not been too happy with it, I think it's been in a big match. I think they want to win the match as well, so it's understandable to maybe take it personally. But for me, I'm just aiming it at my team and aiming it at some people and some friends in the crowd.

“I think [against Jarry] it was a match where there's some moments with not a lot happening. I think some of the points are maybe not worthy of saying ‘vamos' or saying ‘c'mon' but it was a match that I really had to do that, because those points that don't mean a lot, if you lose those ones, you can get broken, and the match can go away from you very quickly.”

To his credit, Norrie keeps the same energy regardless of his opposition. After their match at the Italian Open in 2023, Novak Djokovic also took issue with Norrie's frequent fist‑pumping. As he faces off against Alcaraz, the two-time defending champion and French Open champion who is on a 22‑match winning run, Norrie vowed that he will not shy away from the occasion.

“There's a lot of big matches, and we're playing and we're competing for [our] livelihood out there. So I want to compete as hard as I can, and I'm not going to tank matches and roll over matches for someone else. I'm doing it for myself, I'm not doing it to make someone else feel bad, or not doing it for that. If they take it personally, it's nothing to do with me.”

Despite the gulf between their achievements, tennis is a game of match-ups and Norrie has at least caused Alcaraz trouble. The Spaniard has won four and lost two against Norrie but the Briton has won two of their past three meetings. At times, Norrie has been able to wear the world No 2 down with his shot tolerance and physicality, luring him into lengthy rallies and exposing Alcaraz's lack of patience. The pair have a great relationship and train together frequently at tournaments.

“Facing Cam is always really, really difficult,” Alcaraz said. “We have really difficult battles. For me facing him is almost a nightmare, to be honest. Really tough from the baseline. I'm not surprised he's in the quarter-final playing great tennis because I've seen him practising. When he lost at Queen's [Club], he stayed for five days practising morning, afternoon and night. I saw him. So I'm not surprised at all seeing his level.”

Alcaraz, though, has improved dramatically since Norrie won their most recent meeting, in the 2023 Rio Open final. He presents a completely different challenge across best-of-five-sets at grand slams and the grass courts only accentuate his complete game. The Spaniard will enter Centre Court as the clear favourite in his pursuit of a third Wimbledon title .","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"

Novak Djokovic overcame an uncharacteristically unsteady start to avoid what would have been his earliest exit at Wimbledon since 2016, coming through for a 1-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 victory over 11th-seeded Alex de Minaur in the fourth round Monday.

With Roger Federer, an eight-time Wimbledon winner, sitting in the front row of the Royal Box, so little went right at the outset for the 38-year-old Djokovic on the grass below during a breezy afternoon with the temperature in the 60s Fahrenheit (teens Celsius), a week after matches were contested in record-breaking heat.

But Djokovic turned things around enough to grab the middle two sets and then really took control after trailing 4-1 in the fourth. He won the last five games and 14 of the final 15 points.

His bid for an eighth Wimbledon title and 25th Grand Slam singles trophy overall will continue against No. 22 Flavio Cobolli of Italy. Cobolli reached his first major quarterfinal with a 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (4), 7-6 (3) victory over 2014 U.S. Open champion and two-time major runner-up Marin Cilic.

Djokovic will be appearing in his 63rd Slam quarterfinal.

Against de Minaur, he made mistake after mistake, double-faulting four times in the first set alone. By match's end, he had faced a hard-to-believe 19 break points.

After entering with 41 holds in 42 service games in the tournament, Djokovic was broken in five of his first seven against de Minaur, a 26-year-old Australian who was supposed face the Serb in last year's quarterfinals at Wimbledon but withdrew with an injured hip.

Despite producing merely four clean winners of his own in the opening set, de Minaur accumulated nearly twice as many points as Djokovic, 27-14. That's because Djokovic contributed a whopping 16 unforced errors.

“I can't remember when I've seen him play a worse set than this,” John McEnroe, who won Wimbledon three times in the 1980s, said on the BBC telecast. “I mean, it's literally been years.”

All in all, Djokovic was discombobulated, chalking it up afterward to nerves. He rushed between points. He reacted to flubbed shots by rolling his eyes or shouting and glaring in the direction of his guest box or putting his arms wide as if seeking explanations from someone, anyone.

At changeovers, he placed an ice-filled towel — usually wrapped around necks by players in steamy conditions — on his stomach, which he complained about during his first-round victory last week. But afterward, Djokovic dismissed the significance of that.

This could have been Djokovic's soonest setback at Wimbledon since he was eliminated in the third round by Sam Querrey nine years ago. That one was even more shocking, because it ended Djokovic's 30-match Grand Slam winning streak, which included championships at the preceding four major tournaments in a row, making him the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold each of those trophies simultaneously.

Djokovic won his men's-record 24th major title at the 2023 U.S. Open.

He's come close to raising his total, finishing as the runner-up to Carlos Alcaraz at Wimbledon last year — the second consecutive time they met in the final, with the results the same — and departing each of the first two Slams of 2025 in the semifinals: he stopped with a hurt hamstring at the Australian Open in January and lost to No. 1 Jannik Sinner at the French Open last month.

No man as old as Djokovic is now has won a major championship.

He keeps showing why it's not preposterous to think he could, though, such as his diving volley winner earlier in the tournament or the way Djokovic broke to lead 2-1 in the second set on a 35-stroke exchange Monday. He put his right index finger to his ear and waved his arms to ask for noise from the spectators.

The comeback officially was on, and soon enough, he was closing the third set with a winner to cap a 27-shot point.

By the very end, it's almost as though de Minaur was resigned to defeat, knowing he's only the latest — and perhaps not the last — opponent to succumb to a surging Djokovic.

Novak Djokovic overcomes a tough start to defeat Alex de Minaur in four sets and reach the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. (0:41)

Novak Djokovic overcame an uncharacteristically unsteady start to avoid what would have been his earliest exit at Wimbledon since 2016, coming through for a 1-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 victory over 11th-seeded Alex De Minaur in the fourth round Monday.

Djokovic, who has won seven of his 24 Grand Slam titles at Wimbledon, advanced to his 63rd major quarterfinal. But very little went right at the outset for the 38-year-old.

""A lot of challenging moments for me,"" Djokovic said right after the win, then later called it a ""big, big relief"" not to get pushed to a fifth set.

After entering with 41 holds in 42 service games in the tournament, Djokovic was broken in five of his first seven against De Minaur, a 26-year-old Australian who was supposed face the Serb in last year's quarterfinals at Wimbledon but withdrew with an injured hip.

Djokovic made 16 unforced errors in the first set alone, which he lost in 31 minutes. Before Monday, Djokovic had never won fewer than two games in an opening set at Wimbledon.

""I can't remember when I've seen him play a worse set than this,"" John McEnroe, who won Wimbledon three times in the 1980s, said on the BBC telecast. ""I mean, it's literally been years.""

But Djokovic turned things around in the middle sets, saying afterward that he considered the end of the second a momentum shift.

He really surged at the end after trailing 4-1 in the fourth. He saved a break point to avoid going down 5-1, taking the last five games and 14 of the final 15 points.

""Lifted his level,"" De Minaur said, ""big-time.""

Djokovic was clearly discombobulated early, as he rushed between points and reacted to flubbed shots by rolling his eyes or putting his arms wide as if seeking explanations from someone, anyone.

""I didn't have many solutions, to be honest,"" Djokovic said, ""but I just reset myself in the second.""

At changeovers, he placed an ice-filled towel -- usually wrapped around necks by players in steamy conditions -- on his stomach, which he complained about during his first-round victory last week. But afterward, Djokovic dismissed the significance of that.

""Lot of cat and mouse play, a lot of slices,"" he said of what it's like playing De Minaur. ""It's extremely difficult to play someone like him if you're not feeling the ball very well.""

It was Djokovic's 101st career match win at Wimbledon, tying his most (101 at French Open) at any one major. That's also tied for the fourth-most match wins by any man at one major in the Open era.

""I mean,"" De Minaur summed up, ""he's been pretty good in big moments for a very long time.""

Based on age on the final day of the tournament, Djokovic is the third-oldest man in the Open era to reach the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, after Roger Federer in 2021 and Ken Rosewall in 1974.

Novak Djokovic's 52 major wins when dropping the opening set are the most in the Open era. No one else has 45 such wins.

Federer, and eight-time champion at the All England Club, was sitting in the Royal Box to watch Djokovic's match on Centre Court.

""It's probably the first time he's watched me and I won the match. The last couple I lost,"" Djokovic said. ""So, good to break the curse.""

Djokovic has now won 43 of his past 45 matches at Wimbledon and not since 2017 has he failed to reach the final. The two losses were against reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz in the past two championship matches.

His bid for an eighth Wimbledon title and 25th Grand Slam singles trophy overall will continue against No. 22 Flavio Cobolli of Italy.

Cobolli reached his first major quarterfinal with a 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (4), 7-6 (3) victory over 2014 US Open champion and two-time major runner-up Marin Cilic.

Cobolli's season got off to a rocky start, as he lost seven consecutive tour-level matches beginning with his final match at the United Cup through the Miami Open. But he has been on a roll since, winning 20 of his past 27 tour-level matches that included two ATP titles at Bucharest and Hamburg during the European clay-court swing.

...

Wimbledon, one of four Grand Slam tennis tournaments, is underway.

Some tennis players make tens of millions of dollars each year.

Coco Gauff, Carlos Alcaraz, and Naomi Osaka were some of the highest-paid players in 2024.

It's time to don your best tennis whites and sip a Pimm's Cup: Wimbledon is here.

Wimbledon, the third Grand Slam tennis tournament, began on June 30 and wraps up on July 13. Some major players have already been eliminated from the tournament, including third-seed Alexander Zverev, ninth-seed Daniil Medvedev, and 12th-seed Frances Tiafoe for the men, and second- through-fifth-seeds Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Jasmine Paolini, and Zheng Qinwen for the women.

In other words, it's anyone's game.

Tennis is one of the biggest sports in the world, and according to Tennis.com, the number of players is only growing. There was a jump of nearly 2 million tennis players in the US from 2023 to 2024.

While becoming a professional tennis player is grueling work, it can lead to huge paydays. Forbes ranked the highest-paid tennis players in the world in 2024, with earnings ranging from $13.7 million to an eye-popping $42.3 million.

Here are the highest-earning tennis players in the world, and how they did it.

10. Aryna Sabalenka

Sabalenka, a 27-year-old champ from Belarus, was ranked the first seed at Wimbledon this year, and remains the only woman from the top five still in competition. She's also ranked No. 1 in the world by the WTA.

Forbes reported Sabalenka earned a total of $13.7 million last year: $6.7 million in prize money and $7 million in sponsorships and other deals.

Most recently, she won the 2024 US Open and the 2024 Australian Open. She also made it to the finals of the 2025 Australian Open and the 2025 French Open.

Sabalenka, who has 3 million followers on Instagram, has partnerships with Wilson, Nike, and Audemars Piguet.

9. Casper Ruud

Ruud skipped Wimbledon this year, though he was seeded at No. 15. He announced on June 21 that a knee injury was hindering his ability to play, per ESPN.

The 26-year-old hails from Norway, and although he's never won a Grand Slam (he's been runner-up three times), he's still earned a pretty penny. Forbes estimated that he earned $13.9 million last year, with $10 million coming from off-the-court endeavors and $3.9 million from winnings.

His biggest endorsements are Samsonite, Vitamin Well, watch brand Fleming, Yonex, and Varsity Headwear.

8. Naomi Osaka

Osaka, 27, has been one of the best-known tennis players in the world since her surprise 2018 US Open win over Serena Williams. In the years following, she's won another US Open and two Australian Opens. She also made it to the third round of Wimbledon for the first time since 2018 this year, though she was knocked out by Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.

Osaka, who was born in Japan, earned an estimated $14.6 million last year, and just $600,000 of that came from winnings, Forbes reported. The remaining $14 million came from off-the-court partnerships with Maybelline, Etsy, Nike, and her own media company, Hana Kumo. She also has an impressively loyal fan base of 2.8 million Instagram followers.

7. Daniil Medvedev

Medvedev, who was seeded at No. 9, has already been knocked out of Wimbledon this year, but that shouldn't keep the 29-year-old down for long. He's had multiple finals appearances in Grand Slams and won the US Open in 2021. He also made it to the quarterfinals at the 2020 Olympics as part of the Russian Olympic Committee.

Of course, his $20.3 million earnings from last year should be a nice consolation prize, too.

Medvedev has high-profile deals with video game brands EA Sports and Ubisoft, as a gamer himself, in addition to Lacoste, BMW, and Tecnifibre, which add up to $13 million, Forbes reported.

He also earned $7.3 million in prize money last year.

6. Rafael Nadal

Technically, Nadal isn't a tennis player anymore; he retired in 2024 at 38 years old and as one of three men who completed the career Golden Slam in men's singles (all four Grand Slam tournaments plus a gold medal at the Olympics).

However, in the last full year of his career, he earned $23.3 million. While most of that ($23 million to be specific) came from off the court, we still have to pay respect to one of the GOATs of tennis. Especially one who has won over $120 million in prize money over the course of his career.

Nadal's brand partnerships include Kia, Louis Vuitton, Nike, and the sports app Playtomic.

5. Jannik Sinner

Sinner, 23, is the No. 1 seed for Wimbledon this year and is still in competition for the win. In 2025, he won the Australian Open (which he also won in 2024) and was in the finals of the French Open. Sinner is also ranked No. 1 by ATP, the governing body of men's tennis.

The Italian player, per Forbes, earned $26.6 million last year: $11.6 million in winnings and $15 million from other streams of income.

A quick look at his Instagram feed tells us he has partnerships with Nike, the skincare brand La Roche Posay, Lavazza, and Gucci.

4. Iga Swiatek

Swiatek, 24, is currently ranked No. 4 in the world by the WTA, and was seeded eighth at Wimbledon, where she is still in contention to win.

In addition to being the first Polish tennis player to win a singles title, she's won four of the seven French Opens she's competed in. She also won the US Open in 2022.

Forbes put her 2024 earnings at $26.7 million, with $11.7 million in winnings and $15 million from brand deals and other career endeavors.

You might've seen her promoting Lancôme, On, Rolex, Visa, and Tecnifibre.

3. Coco Gauff

Gauff is not only the youngest player on this list, at 21, but she was also the highest-paid American tennis player last year, earning $27.1 million ($7.1 million in earnings, $20 million in deals), per Forbes.

She rocketed to fame in 2023 after she became the first teenager since Serena Williams in 1999 to win the US Open. Since then, she won the French Open in 2025 and made it to the third round of the 2024 Olympics. She was, however, knocked out of Wimbledon in the first round this year.

Gauff has her own line at New Balance and deals with Bose, UPS, and Naked Juice. She also announced the start of Coco Gauff Enterprises in partnership with the talent agency WME in April 2025.

2. Novak Djokovic

What is there to say about Djokovic? He's the only player in history to win all nine active ATP Masters tournaments, the only player to complete the Career Grand Slam three times, and at 38 years old, he's still ranked No. 6 in the world.

Fittingly, he was also the sixth seed at Wimbledon this year, and is fighting for his eighth Wimbledon title.

While the legend from Serbia is only at No. 2 for 2024 earnings, he's far and away the highest-earning tennis player of all time with $187,870,986 in winnings to his name, per ATP.

Last year, he earned $37.2 million — $25 million of that was off the court, while $12.2 million was prize money.

His endorsements include Joe and the Juice, Asics, Lacoste, and Qatar Airways.

1. Carlos Alcaraz

At the top of the list is 22-year-old Alcaraz, who is looking for a threepeat at Wimbledon this year after winning in 2023 and 2024. He started off 2025 strong with a win at the French Open.

Forbes put Alacaraz's 2024 earnings at $42.3 million, with $10.3 million in prize money and $32 million in endorsements.

Alcaraz, who hails from Spain, has partnered with Rolex, BMW, Nike, Louis Vuitton, Evian, and more. He also starred in his own Netflix docuseries in 2025 called ""Carlos Alcaraz: My Way.""

Amanda Anisimova fought back from a break down in the third set to overcome Linda Noskova and reach the Wimbledon quarterfinals for the second time in her career.

With a possible Top 10 debut in her sights, surging Amanda Anisimova battled her way back into the Wimbledon quarterfinals.

Wimbledon: Scores | Order of play | Draws

In a gripping fourth-round encounter under the roof of No. 1 Court on Sunday evening, No. 13 seed Anisimova of the United States fought past No. 30 seed Linda Noskova of the Czech Republic 6-2, 5-7, 6-4.

Anisimova needed 2 hours and 2 minutes to prevail. The American stormed back from a break down at 3-1 in the third set, outlasting Noskova in a power-hitting showdown.

A post shared by Wimbledon (@wimbledon)

""I didn't remember what the score was,"" Anisimova said after the match. ""Someone told me, 'You were 1-3 down.' I was like, 'I was?'"" she said with a smile.

""I just kept telling myself to, first, keep believing in myself. Second off, just to bring my level up because I feel like I was playing a bit tentative there. ... I knew I had to step it up if I wanted to give myself a chance there in the third.""

The 23-year-old Anisimova is into her third career Grand Slam quarterfinal, and her second at Wimbledon. She is one win away from matching her career-best Grand Slam result, when she made the 2019 Roland Garros semifinals as a 17-year-old before losing to eventual champion Ashleigh Barty.

Anisimova will next face World No. 50 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova with a Wimbledon semifinal spot on the line. Anisimova has won all three of their previous meetings, including two wins last year.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Breakthrough year: Anisimova made the Wimbledon quarterfinals in 2022 but had not played the main draw in London since then. She missed the 2023 event during a hiatus from tour, then fell in the final round of qualifying last year.

Right after that Wimbledon qualifying loss last year, Anisimova quickly began checking off new milestones, and her last 12 months have been the best of her professional career.

Anisimova made her first WTA 1000 final at Toronto last August, and she bettered that earlier this year by winning her first WTA 1000 title at Doha in February. The Doha title pushed her into the Top 20 for the first time in her career.

Contesting Wimbledon at a career-high PIF WTA Ranking of World No. 12, Anisimova could potentially crack the Top 10 after the event, depending upon the remaining tournament results. Either way, it is a huge rise from her position of No.189 just 12 months ago.

""I think a lot of things have changed for myself,"" Anisimova said. ""My work ethic and I feel like my professionalism has took a whole 360. ... Everything is centered around my tennis and how I can prepare the best that I can and recover from my matches.

""I think ever since I took my break, I just found this new perspective and this newfound sense of fighting for everything and accepting the challenges that come and embracing them. I think maybe I didn't do it quite like I do it now.""

A post shared by Amanda Kay Victoria (@amandaanisimova)

Growing on grass: Anisimova notched her 10th grass-court match-win of the year by beating Noskova on Sunday. The American has not lost before the quarterfinals on the surface this season, making the Queen's Club final and reaching the Berlin quarterfinals.

But Anisimova needed all of her grit to hold off 20-year-old Noskova. Anisimova completely dominated the first set, but Noskova took the early lead in the second set, breaking for 2-1 after coming out on top in a forehand-to-forehand rally.

Noskova failed to convert a set point at 5-4 and dropped serve, but the big-hitting Czech struck right back with a love break for 6-5. With her second opportunity, Noskova slammed an ace to convert her second set point.

Another love break caused Anisimova to fall behind 3-1 in the decider, as upset artist Noskova neared her 15th career Top 20 win. However, three forehand errors by Noskova at 3-2 gave Anisimova a lifeline, and the American took advantage, reaching 3-3 with a deft passing winner.

With the momentum back in her favor, Anisimova found key aces to keep herself in front through 5-4, where she reached double match point on Noskova's serve. The American's backhand was her more reliable wing on the day, and she hit her 10th winner from that side to close out a tough victory.

2025 British Grand Prix: Hulkenberg's race from P19 to his first podium

Radio Rewind: 2025 British Grand Prix

Previous

Lewis Hamilton is taking the positives from Qualifying at the British Grand Prix, despite missing out on a potential front row start.

Lewis Hamilton was left satisfied with a “better” feeling Ferrari in Qualifying for the British Grand Prix, with the seven-time World Champion not giving up on a podium after taking P5 despite earlier looking to be in the fight for pole.

After hinting at good pace earlier in the weekend – having set the pace in the weekend's opening practice session – Hamilton followed this up by going fastest during Q2, sparking celebratory scenes amongst his fans in the crowd.

The Briton went on to claim P2 during the first runs of Q3 but was not able to improve, leaving him in a final position of fifth.

Reflecting back on his final effort, Hamilton said: “The lap was pretty decent at the end and then I lost a bit of time in the last corner, which probably would have put me on the front row or at least third.

“We were right on the knife edge I think, other than that squeezed everything I could out the car.”

Pushed on whether he is taking the positives from being in the position to fight again as he continues to adapt to the SF-25, the 40-year-old responded: “I definitely feel a lot better in the car this weekend.

“This track is incredible, the crowd's been amazing but we needed just a little bit more, like another tenth of performance in the car just to nudge us a little bit closer to the front guys.”

And while he is not starting as far up the order as he might have liked, Hamilton has not given up on dreaming of a podium at his home event.

“Of course, I'll dream of it tonight and I'll try and execute tomorrow,” he explained. “I think the weather's going to be interesting, I'd imagine it's dry probably for the race but it would be cool if it's drizzling or… yeah, we'll see.”

Team mate Charles Leclerc had also looked strong during the early stages of Qualifying but, like Hamilton, did not put his final lap together perfectly and wound up in P6.

Asked if he had been left frustrated by the session, the Monegasque conceded: “Yeah, horrible. Nothing really to say, I think the pace was there for the front row but I eventually didn't do the job when I needed to. I lost the car in the last two corners and lost a lot of lap time.

“That's been the story of the season, I need to find back my rhythm in Qualifying because I'm really struggling and I'm not putting everything together, and all the time I get out of the car there's always one thing that hasn't gone my way in Qualifying, so I'm very frustrated with myself more than anything.

“I know that in the race I'm doing a really good job generally, but I've got to put everything together.”

In terms of whether he still has a good race car for the main event – with Ferrari often faring better in race trim than Qualifying form – a downbeat Leclerc added: “As always yes, but when you are starting P6 then it's going to be very difficult.”

2025 British Grand Prix: Hulkenberg's race from P19 to his first podium

Radio Rewind: 2025 British Grand Prix

Kick Sauber driver Nico Hulkenberg ended his long wait for a podium finish in Formula 1 with a stunning drive to third place at the British Grand Prix.

After 239 starts, Nico Hulkenberg finally stood on the podium as an F1 driver at the end of a dramatic, rain-hit British Grand Prix – the German describing it as a “pretty surreal” achievement.

Hulkenberg arrived on the F1 grid back in 2010, with his best result up to Sunday's race – which marked his 239th start – being a fourth-place finish on three occasions.

But the 37-year-old changed that statistic with a supreme rise from 19th in tricky, changeable conditions at Silverstone, following the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri home via a spirited defence against Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton.

“It's been a long time coming, hasn't it?” Hulkenberg beamed afterwards. “I always knew we have it in us, and I have it in me somewhere.

“I mean what a race, coming from virtually last, and doing it all over again from last weekend, was pretty surreal to be honest. Not sure how it all happened, but obviously crazy conditions, mixed conditions – it was a survival fight for a lot of the race.

“I think we were just really on it – the right calls, the right tyres in the right moment. We made no mistakes and it's quite incredible.”

After several close podium misses in the past, Hulkenberg continued: “Today, I think I was in denial until the last pit stop, then when I heard we had gapped Lewis quite a bit with the one extra lap I was like, ‘Okay, this is good! This is some breathing space!'

“But then he was catching quite quickly. The pressure was there, it was an intense race, but we didn't crack. No mistakes and obviously really, really happy with that.

“Obviously I was thinking that Lewis is going to give it all in front of his home crowd and I was like, ‘Sorry guys – it's also my day!' I've got to stick my neck out.”

Hulkenberg's fourth successive top-10 finish moves Sauber up to sixth in the Teams' Championship standings on 41 points, five clear of rivals Racing Bulls and Aston Martin.

Lando Norris secured home victory in a dramatic British Grand Prix, as Nico Hulkenberg took his maiden F1 podium.

Lando Norris secured home victory as he led his penalised McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri across the line in an eventful wet-dry British Grand Prix.

While McLaren took another 1-2, Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg expertly rose from a P19 start on the grid to take his maiden F1 podium on what was his 239th Grand Prix start.

With the British weather playing its part in proceedings at Silverstone, polesitter Max Verstappen had initially held the race lead before being passed by Piastri on Lap 8. However, things took a turn for Piastri as he was hit with a 10-second time penalty for slowing too much when preparing to lead the pack away at a Safety Car restart, while a spin for Verstappen moments later saw the Dutchman drop backwards.

Elsewhere five drivers retired, with Franco Colapinto the first to do so after stalling his Alpine in the pit lane. Liam Lawson exited on Lap 1 following a collision with Esteban Ocon, while Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto was the next to record a DNF after a spin into the gravel.

Isack Hadjar suffered a heavy crash in the mixed conditions and Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli became the final retiree, with his car involved in the Hadjar collision.

The British Grand Prix at Silverstone produced not only a memorable race, but also a treasure trove of top trivia to dive into.

It was never a dull moment at Silverstone as the fickle British weather kept the fans on the edge of their seats throughout the 52 laps. Those fans were rewarded with a home win, as McLaren's Lando Norris took top honours, though another of his compatriots was notable by his podium absence. Here's our round-up of the need-to-know numbers…

•	Norris is the 13th British driver to win the British Grand Prix.

•	It's the 25th time that a British driver has won at Silverstone in 75 years of the World Championship.

•	It was the first McLaren win at Silverstone since Lewis Hamilton in 2008.

•	Norris has reduced the championship gap to eight points behind Oscar Piastri.

•	With Piastri finishing in P2, McLaren have scored consecutive one-twos in Austria and Great Britain.

•	It was McLaren's fifth 1-2 finish of 2025, their most in any season in the 21st century.

•	In P3 for Kick Sauber, Nico Hulkenberg has had the longest career in F1 history before scoring a first podium finish (238 Grands Prix over 15 years).

•	It was the first Sauber podium finish since Japan 2012 with Kamui Kobayashi.

•	Hulkenberg is the first German to finish on the podium since Sebastian Vettel at the 2021 Azerbaijan Grand Prix.

•	Hulkenberg is the oldest first-time podium finisher (37 years old) since George Follmer (39 years old) at the 1973 Spanish Grand Prix.

•	Kick Sauber have jumped up to seventh place in the Constructors' Championship after that result.

•	Hulkenberg started 19th, the lowest-ever starting position for a podium finisher in Sauber's 32-year history.

•	Hulkenberg had spent 177 laps in a podium position across his career before this race.

•	Hulkenberg is the 218th driver to finish on the podium in F1 championship history.

•	With P4 for Ferrari, Lewis Hamilton tied his best Grand Prix result of the season for the second race running.

•	It ended Hamilton's run of 12 consecutive podium finishes at Silverstone (the longest streak by any driver at any circuit).

•	After finishing fifth for Red Bull, Max Verstappen is now 69 points behind the championship lead.

•	In P6, Pierre Gasly scored Alpine's best result of the season.

•	Lance Stroll's P7 finish for Aston Martin was his first top-eight finish since the season's opening race in Australia.

•	Stroll ran his first laps in a podium position since 2023.

•	Williams' Alex Albon scored points at Silverstone for the third consecutive season with his P8 result.

•	Fernando Alonso came home ninth for Aston Martin to secure his fourth consecutive points finish this season.

•	It was Alonso's sixth consecutive points finish at Silverstone.

•	With George Russell in P10 and Kimi Antonelli retiring, Mercedes missed the podium at Silverstone for the first time since 2012.

•	There were eight constructors in the points positions, tying the highest number this season.

•	Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finished outside the points for the first time this season, in P14 (he was disqualified from fifth place in China).

•	Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda, in P15, was the last classified finisher for the second consecutive race.

•	Antonelli's DNF was his fourth retirement in the last six races.

•	The DNF for Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar was the French rookie's first official retirement from a Grand Prix (he failed to take the start in Australia).

•	Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto also retired, meaning the two drivers with career-best finishes last time out in Austria (Bortoleto and Liam Lawson) were both out before the end of Lap 6 at Silverstone.

•	Lawson's DNF was the first time he's ever retired on the first lap of a Grand Prix (he retired on Lap 1 of the Sprint in Qatar 2023).

•	Racing Bulls saw both cars out by Lap 19, their first double DNF since China 2024.

The seventh installment in the action-adventure franchise created by Steven Spielberg opened well ahead of expectations over the long Fourth of July holiday in the U.S. — where it racked up $147.8 million — as well as overseas. 


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	The dinos have a new lease on life.


	Universal and Amblin's Jurassic World Rebirth came in well ahead of expectations at the Fourth of July box office to hatch a new era for the Steven Spielberg-created franchise. In North America, the holiday tentpole is reporting a five-day domestic opening of $147.8 million, including $92 million for the three-day weekend, according to final numbers. (Estimates were revised upward every day since the pic hit the big screen midweek on July 2.)




Jurassic World Rebirth, the seventh title in the series, is roaring even louder overseas, where it opened to an estimated $174.8 million from 82 markets. That puts the film's global start at $322.6 million — the second-best launch of the franchise, and the biggest worldwide opening of the year to date for a Hollywood release after passing up A Minecraft Movie. No one saw that coming.

	Internationally, Rebirth scored the second-best international opening of the year and of the franchise. It even bit off a big number in China, where Hollywood tentpoles can no longer depend upon big grosses. The dino franchise, like the Mission: Impossible films, is an exception. Rebirth debuted to $41.5 million to score the biggest opening of the year so far for a Hollywood title. And it already ranks as the second-biggest Hollywood pic of the year behind Mission: Impossible – the Final Reckoning. Other top markets included the U.K. ($16.6 million) and Mexico ($14 million).


	In North America, Rebirth ranks as the fourth-best showing ever for the July Fourth holiday, both in terms of the five-day and three-day numbers. That's no small feat considering July 4 fell on a Friday this year, meaning many moviegoers were distracted by holiday outings on what's normally a critical day for new films.

	











	To boot, the latest Jurassic World pic has received decidedly mixed reviews from both critics and audiences alike (one example: it earned a meh B CinemaScore from moviegoers). But there's no dismissing the power of the Jurassic brand, or the spectacle of seeing dinosaurs come to life on the big screen. “It's the definition of a popcorn movie,” is one common refrain making the rounds in Hollywood. Another? “It's dumb fun.”


	Heading into the holiday, the pic was eyeing a far more modest domestic opening in the $100 to $120 million range and $260 million globally, considering it was a reboot and the seventh installment in a series more than 30 years old.


	Following the conclusion of the Jurassic World trilogy directed by Colin Trevorrow, Spielberg, Amblin and Universal, they went back to the drawing board and enlisted filmmaker Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) to direct Rebirth from a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp. If all goes well, it will be the first title in another trilogy, according to insiders.


	The film features an all-new cast anchored by Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali and Jonathan Bailey. The story follows an extraction team that races to an island research facility that factored into the original Jurassic Park (along the way, they discover a shipwrecked family). Now, the island is inhabited by the worst of the worst creatures that were left behind.Rupert Friend, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Luna Blaise, David Iacono and Audrina Miranda also star. Producers include longtime franchise stewards Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, with Spielberg and Denis Stewart exec producing.


	The first three Jurassic World pics all grossed north of $1 billion globally, and all opened higher than Rebirth domestically (comparisons are complicated by the fact that those were all three-day, non-holiday openings). In 2015, Jurassic World opened to a franchise-best $208.8 million, followed by $148 million for 2018's Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and $145 million for 2022's Jurassic World: Dominion, not adjusted for inflation. At the same time, the latest film cost less to produce, or a net $180 million before marketing.

	











	The first Jurassic Park, directed by Spielberg, opened to $47 million domestically in early June 1993, not adjusted for inflation — a huge sum at the time.


	Also setting off fireworks at the box office was Brad Pitt's F1: The Movie, which has already earned nearly $300 million globally, including a 10-day domestic tally of $109.2million.


	From Apple Original Films in partnership with Warner Bros., F1 came in second over the holiday weekend with an estimated three-day gross of $25.7 million. Overseas, it racked up another $56.3 million for a foreign cume of $184.1 million and $293.3 million globally.


	The movie, reteaming Top Gun: Maverick director Joseph Kosinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer, is a critical and audience darling and fell just 54 percent in its second outing. The film is enjoying a major boost from having a lock on Imax screens for three weekends. 


	Universal was a double winner at the holiday box office as DreamWorks Animation's live-action How to Train Your Dragon came in third place with an estimated $11 million for a domestic tally of $224 million. Globally, it set off fireworks in clearing the $500 million milestone after amassing a foreign haul of $292.9 million. 


	Pixar and Disney's troubled pic Elio came in fourth with an estimated $5.7 million for a muted domestic tally of $55.1 million. Overseas, it earned another $6.7 million for a foreign tally of $41.7 million and $96.8 million globally.

	











	Danny Boyle and Sony's 28 Years Later rounded out the top five domestically with $4.6 million for a domestic haul of $60.2 million. The sequel grossed another $7 million at the international box office for a foreign total of $65.6 million and $125.8 million globally.


Blumhouse and Atomic Monster's ill-fated M3GAN 2.0 fell off somewhat less than expected, or 62 percent, in its second weekend to an estimated $3.8 million after bombing in its debut a week ago. The Universal releases tied for sixth place with Disney's live-action Lilo & Stitch, which is likewise reporting a three-day gross of $3.8 million.


Lilo & Stitch made major headlines in passing up A Minecraft Movie to become the top-earning pic of 2025 at the worldwide box office after finishing Sunday with a global total of $972.7 million. It remains to be seen whether the Memorial Day release can become the first Hollywood title of the year to join the billion-dollar club. 


	Elsewhere on the top 10 chart, fellow Memorial Day release Mission: Impossible: The Final Reckoning finished Sunday with a global haul of $576.2 million.

The criticism followed the popular podcaster calling the mass targeting of undocumented migrant workers for arrest and deportation “insane” in an episode released last week.


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


Mark Ruffalo is calling out podcaster and prominent Trump supporter Joe Rogan for being late to the game in his criticism of ICE immigration raids.


	“Dear @joerogan. It's a little late now to pretend like project 2025 didn't exist and wasn't the play book all along. You are either not that smart or not that dumb. It's hard to tell at this point,” Ruffalo, who campaigned heavily for Democrat Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential campaign, wrote on Threads.



	He added Rogan should have known about Trump's immigration policies when he supported his 2024 re-election campaign. Ruffalo was reacting to a July 2 episode of the Joe Rogan Experience in which the podcaster hit out at ICE raids on workplaces where undocumented migrant workers were targeted.

	“It's insane. We were told there would be no — well, there are two things that are insane. One is the targeting of migrant workers — not cartel members, not gang members, not drug dealers — just construction workers, showing up in construction sites, raiding them. Gardeners. Like, really?” Rogan said during a conversation with Replit CEO Amjad Masad.


	During his second administration, Trump has stepped up the arrest of people accused of immigration violations. The ongoing immigration raids have sparked protests, including in Los Angeles, against what critics call unlawful ICE raids.

	











	In response to the L.A. protests, Trump deployed National Guard troops over California Gov. Gavin Newsom‘s opposition, leading to a legal dispute between the president and the state leader. Late last month, an appeals court ruling that Trump could retain control of the National Guard troops he deployed to L.A.

Juel Taylor and Tony Rettenmaier will pen the script for the live-action feature take of the iconic racing toy brand.


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


Crazy Rich Asians and Wicked director Jon M. Chu is set to helm the live-action Hot Wheels feature, the big screen take on Mattel's iconic toy cars for Warner Bros. 


	The screenwriting duo of Juel Taylor and Tony Rettenmaier will pen the script, with J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot Productions, which has longstanding ties with Warner Bros., and Chu's Electric Somewhere producing.   




	The hiring of the director and writers is a major development for the project that originated with Warner teaming with Mattel Studios in January 2019 to develop and produce a big-screen project. The action film promises to bring the iconic Hot Wheels franchise to the movies screen.

	“Jon's ability to craft rich, elaborate worlds with a distinct point of view makes him the ideal storyteller to bring Hot Wheels to life. His films are visual spectacles — true eye candy — but what sets them apart is how he weaves unforgettable narratives within those stunning frames. Paired with Juel and Tony's compelling storytelling, this team is uniquely positioned to capture the heart, adrenaline, and spirit of Hot Wheels, a leading brand in car culture.,” Robbie Brenner, president of Mattel Studios and chief content officer, said in a statement on Monday.


	The collaboration between Warner Bros. and Mattel Studios follows the box-office success of the Greta Gerwig-directed Warner Bros. tentpole Barbie. 


	Chu added in his own statement: “Hot Wheels has always been about more than speed — it's about imagination, connection and the thrill of play. Bringing that spirit to the big screen is an incredible opportunity. I'm excited to partner with Mattel Studios, Warner Bros. Pictures and Bad Robot to create an adventure that honors Hot Wheels' legacy while driving it somewhere entirely new.”

	











	Chu recently directed Universal Pictures' Wicked starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. He also directed In the Heights for Warner Bros.


	The film's producers — including Mattel as it looks to its toy properties to become a franchise-driven entertainment giant — have yet to lift the hood on the movie's plotline. “We already felt incredibly lucky to collaborate with Mattel on this special film. Having Jon, Juel and Tony come aboard takes our excitement to a whole new level,” said Abrams in his own statement.


	Taylor and Rettenmaier have worked on projects like Creed II and They Cloned Tyrone,  which marked Taylor's directorial debut. Brenner is producing for Mattel Studios alongside Chu, Abrams and Michael Bostick.

Plus, Morgan Wallen ties Kendrick Lamar and nears the Beatles for a record.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Alex Warren's “Ordinary” rolls on atop the Billboard Hot 100, as his first leader on the chart notches a fifth week at No. 1.


	Meanwhile, Morgan Wallen logs his fifth week in 2025 with at least three songs in the Hot 100's top five simultaneously, as “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, holds at No. 2, “Just in Case” rises 4-3 and “I'm the Problem” keeps at No. 5. Wallen ties Kendrick Lamar for the most weeks with three or more concurrent top five hits in a single year among soloists, with Lamar also having posted three such weeks this year. Among all acts, only the Beatles in their historic 1964 breakthrough boasted more such frames (eight).


	Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated July 12, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, July 8. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	“Ordinary,” on Atlantic Records, tallied 20.2 million official streams (up 2% week-over-week),  69.7 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 9%) and 7,000 sold (up 3%) in the United States June 27-July 3.


	“Ordinary” holds at No. 2 on the Streaming Songs chart, following four weeks at the summit; adds a third week at No. 1 on Radio Songs; and rebounds 2-1 for an eighth week atop Digital Song Sales.


	The track also continues to shine at No. 1 on the Songs of the Summer chart, having led in all six weeks since the seasonal survey made its annual return after Memorial Day.


	Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, is steady at No. 2 on the Hot 100, after it debuted in May as Wallen's fourth No. 1 and McRae's first. It claims a sixth week atop Streaming Songs (22.8 million, up 2%) and a seventh week at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart.


	Wallen follows on the Hot 100 with two No. 2-peaking hits: “Just in Case,” which lifts 4-3, and “I'm the Problem,” which holds at No. 5. Wallen rings up his fifth week in 2025 with at least three songs in the top five simultaneously — tying Kendrick Lamar for the most weeks with three or more concurrent top five hits in a single year among soloists, with Lamar also having earned three such weeks this year. Among all acts, only the Beatles in 1964 achieved more such frames (eight).


	As for career marks, dating to the Hot 100's 1958 start, Wallen's fifth week with three or more simultaneous top five hits (all notched since May) ties him with Justin Bieber for the fourth-most. The Beatles lead with eight such weeks, followed by Drake and Lamar with six each.


	Similarly, Wallen charts five songs in the Hot Country Songs top 10. Dating to his first such week in January 2021, it's his 28th week with at least half the list's top 10 — no other act has more than one week earning the honor (Beyoncé, in 2024, and Zach Bryan and Taylor Swift, both in 2023).


	Meanwhile, Wallen's I'm the Problem — the parent set of all three of his current top five Hot 100 hits — scores a seventh week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.


	Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” buzzes 7-4 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 beginning last July.


	Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” repeats at No. 6 after 13 weeks atop the Hot 100 beginning in March. It collects a 28th week at No. 1 on both the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts, extending the longest reign on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (dating to October 1958, when the chart became the genre's all-encompassing songs ranking).


	Sabrina Carpenter's “Manchild” drops 3-7 on the Hot 100, after it debuted as her second No. 1, and first chart-topping debut, three weeks earlier.


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and became the year's No. 1 song, ascends 9-8. It adds a record-extending 68th week in the top 10 and a record-furthering 98th week on the chart overall.


	Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” slips 8-9 on the Hot 100 after five weeks at No. 1 beginning in January. Already the longest-charting song in the top 10 ever by a woman artist — 45 weeks — it surpasses The Kid LAROI and Justin Bieber's “Stay,” in 2021-22, for the longest such stay for a collaboration. Overall, only “Lose Control,” “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” (60 weeks) and The Weeknd's “Blinding Lights” (57) have spent more time in the top 10.


	Rounding out the Hot 100's top 10, Chappell Roan's “Pink Pony Club” rides back into the tier (11-10), after it reached No. 4. Also notably, while Alex Warren's “Ordinary” is the week's top-selling download, Chappell Roan's “The Giver” is the week's top-selling song overall, with 57,000 in sales, up from a negligible sum, after vinyl copies, which account for nearly all the song's sales in the tracking week, were shipped to consumers. The single reenters the Hot 100 at No. 43 — it launched at its No. 5 high, and at No. 1 on Hot Country Songs, in March.

The ""Antichrist Superstar"" performer was not on hand for Saturday's all-star tribute.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



Marilyn Manson was not part of the line-up for Saturday's (July 5) epic Back to the Beginning final concert by a reunited Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne. While a murder's row of hard rock and heavy metal superstars took the stage at Villa Park in Birmingham, England to fête the Prince of Darkness in what was billed as Osbourne's last-ever show with original Sabbath mates guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler and drummer Bill Ward, Manson beamed in with a video message paying homage.

	











	But based on some fan reaction to the gesture, it was not well-received by all. “F–k that guy he's a rapist piece of s–t,” wrote one fan after video of the tribute was posted. In the clip, Manson (born Brian Warner), 56 — who was accused in lawsuits from four women of sexual assault and domestic abuse — said, “It is a great honor to be here via this video,” according to the NME. “And I'd like to say congratulations, and I love you very much, Ozzy.”

	











	After the video played at the show featuring sets from Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Tool, Pantera, Anthrax and many more, fans weighed in online about the surprise Manson pop-in. “Eurgh Marilyn Manson making an appearance on the sabbath stream. F–k that guy he's a rapist piece of s–t,” wrote one, with others adding, “Marilyn Manson on the black sabbath stream f–k off” and “disgraceful that he is on this otherwise outstanding Black Sabbath show.”


	According to British media reports, some fans at the show booed during the video or turned their backs on Manson's video. At press time a spokesperson for Manson had not returned Billboard‘s request for comment. It did not appear as if Manson, who performed on Ozzfest in 1997, 2001, 2003, 2017 and 2018, and, like many on the bill has long cited Osbourne and Sabbath as a formative rock influence, was invited to participate in Saturday's show.


	The feeling of some was summed up by another tweet that read, “ew marilyn manson go away.” Manson has long denied the sexual abuse allegations, which have resulted in his being dropped by his label, manager and booking agent, and, most recently, the Oct. 29 One Assassination Under God tour kick-off gig in Brighton, U.K. getting cancelled at the urging of members of Parliament. In January, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office announced that it wouldn't file criminal charges against Manson in the cases, citing the expiration of the statute of limitations and insufficient evidence in the alleged incidents that prosecutors said happened between 2009 and 2011.


Stories about sexual assault allegations can be traumatizing for survivors of sexual assault. If you or anyone you know needs support, you can reach out to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN). The organization provides free, confidential support to sexual assault victims. Call RAINN's National Sexual Assault Hotline (800.656.HOPE) or visit the anti-sexual violence organization's website for more information.

For Entry 005 of Mic Drops and Elbow Drops, Carl Lamarre explores if Drake could help bring the heat back to hip-hop this summer.


													By
												

	Carl Lamarre



	During last year's Fourth of July, Kendrick Lamar set off more than fireworks when he released his now-ubiquitous video, “Not Like Us.” The seething retort against Drake not only rattled the 6 God and his disciples but unequivocally lunged Lamar into God mode. What followed was an unrelenting onslaught: a cinematic Super Bowl performance, a resounding Grammy sweep, and a 13-week Hot 100 triumph with “Luther.” Lamar's indomitable reign has only intensified in the months since courtesy of his Grand National Stadium Tour alongside SZA. TDE's 1-2 punch has landed devastating haymakers with Mike Tyson force while the rest of the rap game scrambles for hits.

	This year's Fourth of July rang a little differently: Lamar's former lyrical combatant Drake entered the ring with ruthless intentions of his own, releasing “What Did I Miss?” After quietly piecing together a solid comeback campaign consisting of his chart-topping $ome $exy $ongs 4 U album with PARTYNEXTDOOR — as well as that set's breakout hit, the No. 2-climbing Hot 100 smash “NOKIA” — Drizzy could be masterminding his biggest heist yet: The Summer of Drake.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Hip-hop needs this, in more ways than one. Aside from “Luther” running the tables on the Hot 100, the only hip-hop song to go No. 1 this year was Travis Scott's “4X4,” which lasted only a week on top and dropped out of the top 40 the next frame. Though Playboi Carti's Music album dominated the Billboard 200 and served as a career win for him, none of the set's singles had longevity inside the top 10 of the Hot 100 either. And while we do have a platter of braggadocious bars being served this month in Clipse's Let God Sort Em Out, alongside a possible reunion between Freddie Gibbs and Alchemist for Alfredo 2, Lamar and Drake remain the genre's main characters. Together, “Luther” and “NOKIA” have kept the genre's pulse alive through the first half of 2025.

	











	Now, with Drake firmly in album mode and gearing up for a historic three-day set at Wireless Festival beginning this Friday (July 11), the cards appear stacked in his favor. Sonically, “What Did I Miss?” is a solid rap return for Drake, who's otherwise spent the year entrenched in his R&B bag. Consider it a shootaround for the rapper: a volley of barbs, an entrancing beat-switch, and some biting shots against one of his former NBA homies.


	Upon its release, “What Did I Miss?” rocketed to the top of Spotify and Apple Charts. Whether it can secure a high debut on the Billboard charts in typical Drake fashion remains to be seen. Still, the rollout, complete with Drake blasting snippets from an Iceman rig truck all over Toronto — was pretty dope. Couple in his upcoming U.K. Tour with PND and the looming OVO Fest, Drake could be positioning himself for a strong return. 


	Would it be enough to dethrone Kung Fu Kenny? That's tough to chew on, considering the god-tier run Lamar has delivered over the last 365 days. Still, we can't dismiss Drake's hitmaking prowess and ability to shake the culture. Even after Lamar's drubbing, Drake snuck back into the conversation with “NOKIA,” which wasn't just a Billboard hit, but was an instant party starter and social media gem. Meanwhile, a song like “Somebody Loves Me” hasn't secured the Hot 100 spotlight like its predecessor, it's a song that continues to light up the social media scoreboard and nightclubs — and has been slowly climbing back up the chart for weeks after its initial debut and fade, re-entering the Hot 100's top half last week. 


	Do we want introspective raps from Drake on Iceman? Yes. But we also need a little bit of 2018 Drake when “In My Feelings” and “Nice For What” rang off in every speaker. Just like how Jay-Z ran the summers during his reign, it doesn't feel right when The Boy isn't clocking in from June to September. Maybe a little dose of Aubrey is what the game needs just about now.

EXCLUSIVE: Shōgun and Warfare star Cosmo Jarvis won't be part of the all-star cast of Christopher Nolan's The Odyssey in the end.


	As reported, Jarvis had been due to join the likes of Matt Damon, Tom Holland, Zendaya, Charlize Theron, Robert Pattinson and Anne Hathaway in the anticipated film, but it turns out a scheduling conflict meant that he had to drop out shortly before filming.


	Jarvis is gearing up to star in the feature biopic Young Stalin about the Russian dictator.




			Watch on Deadline		







	We understand that Jarvis' role in the Nolan-Universal epic was filled by Prometheus and The Defeated star Logan Marshall-Green. The role remains under wraps.

	











	The film, currently set for a release in Imax on July 17, 2026, is filming at locations in Morocco, Italy, Ireland and Scotland. Based on the epic poem, the story follows Odysseus (played by Damon), King of Ithaca, on his dangerous journey home after the Trojan War. During his voyage, the protagonist faces Polyphemus the Cyclops, Sirens, the nymph Calypso and the witch goddess Circe in the treacherous oceans that separate him from his island home and wife Penelope, who unravels a wedding train that she weaves every night in the event that one of the suitors who have taken over her home ends up marrying her should her husband not return. His memory is also guarded by his son Telemachus (played in the movie by Holland). The story also features Gods including Athena, Poseidon and Zeus.


	A teaser trailer, currently playing in theaters, recently leaked on TikTok and X. Universal released a first-look image (below) earlier this year.

People have forgotten Landgraf originally ran the company that produced “Reno 911” before he became the town crier yelling “peak Tv” and this is yet another Comedy Central style mockumentary featuring a diverse cast of comedians, obvious situations with safe and predictable hilarity ensuing.  When's the last time we've heard a comedy premise that sounded innovative?  To me, “Reno 911” was always “Police Academy” without a script.

Well, OK. I haven't seen Robert Ben Garant in a while. He appeared to be off RENO 911, and didn't participate in the State reunion, or even the festivities around Keri Kenney-Silver's Four Seasons. I was concerned he was not well.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Catherine Hardwicke launched Twilight and was rewarded with a mini cupcake","https://www.avclub.com/catherine-hardwicke-twilight-cupcake","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 16:14:00 GMT","

Catherine Hardwicke has done an enormous amount for Hollywood. She launched the massively successful Twilight film franchise, not to mention the lauded careers of both Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart. She also gave a whole cadre of other A-listers some of their earliest work, including Oscar Isaac (The Nativity Story), Jeremy Renner (Lords Of Dogtown), and Evan Rachel Wood (Thirteen). She introduced the world to vampire baseball and even wrote one of the greatest lines of all time, at least in this writer's opinion: “You better hold on tight, spider-monkey.”

And yet, for all her contributions, she was rewarded by Twilight producer Summit Entertainment with… a mini cupcake. Not even a full-sized treat! In a recent interview with The Guardian, the director said she knew successful male directors were often gifted “a car, or a three-picture deal, or [getting] to do basically whatever you want” by the studio after a box office success on Twilight‘s magnitude. (The original film made over $400 million worldwide.) Hardwicke, however, remembers that she “walked into a room with all these gifts, and everybody was congratulating the studio, and they gave me a box… I opened it up, and it was a mini cupcake.”

The revelation that the film's success wouldn't automatically snowball into more opportunities was “an earth-shattering reality right away,” she reflected. “No, people aren't going to hire more women directors. They're not going to give you the next job and let you do something great.” She was replaced by male directors for the remainder of the franchise. 

Still, Hardwicke pressed on and continued to make films that are personally meaningful to her. She's currently in post-production on her latest project, Street Smart, which she describes as “a kind of homeless The Breakfast Club” starring Yara Shahidi, Isabelle Fuhrman, Michael Cimino, and a group of unknowns with “big hearts and compassion for others; otherwise, they would be trying to work on a superhero film.”

In addition to serving as a “love letter to Venice” (the California neighborhood), the film is also a rebuke of Donald Trump's politics. “Even though we wrote it before he got elected, Street Smart is directly addressing some of [these] issues,” Hardwicke said. “It's telling a compelling story that shows people who do not look like Donald Trump, or think like him.” Hopefully, this film will lead to more opportunities for the director; or, if nothing else, at least a full-size dessert.

Over the weekend, Lauryn Hill performed for a handful of fans in the middle of the night, hours after she was originally scheduled to take the stage. The real headline here, however, is that it wasn't her fault. The notoriously tardy singer was added as a headliner for New Orleans' Essence Festival of Culture just a few days ago, and did close out Friday night at the Superdome as promised. Only it wasn't Friday by the time she actually began her set. NOLA.com reports that Hill's band started playing at 2:31 a.m. when the stadium was already “essentially empty,” and didn't exit the stage until 3:37 a.m.

Hill wasn't the only performer who had a later night than expected. The festival's entire schedule was delayed from the jump, per NOLA.com, with GloRilla, the fourth of eight total performers, finishing her set 45 minutes after The Isley Brothers were scheduled to start. The sets kept getting later as the night wore on, with Babyface starting his performance around midnight, nearly two hours after he was originally slated to take the stage. Maxwell, the second-to-last performer, began his scheduled 11:15 p.m. performance around 12:55 a.m. 

Unsurprisingly, given Hill's reputation for postponing shows and generally treating set times as a loose guideline, there was some backlash on social media when news of Hill's late performance spread. The festival, to its credit, attempted to shut that down in an Instagram post after the fact. “Family is family and around here we protect our own no matter what the PEOPLE have to say,” it wrote. “Let's be very clear— WE don't play about Ms. Lauryn Hill. Not for clicks. Not for headlines.”

“She arrived on schedule, stepped on that stage, and delivered the kind of performance only a legend can,” the post continued. “The delay? Not hers. We will take that. The moment? One for the books. The legacy? Still unmatched. Put some respect on her name. Keep the takes, but keep her out of them.” 

Besides, it sounds like the “nightclub-sized crowd” that did pull an all-nighter got a pretty special show. Hill performed alongside her sons Zion and YG Marley and reportedly “bantered” with fans in between songs. At one point, she took a request to sing “I Gotta Find Peace Of Mind” from her 2002 live acoustic album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0, even though she said she “didn't rehearse that.” Later, she singled out a specific audience member after singing “Tell Him” to say, “Sister, I was watching you for the lyrics.” It's hard to blame her for being a little fuzzy that early in the morning. That audience member may have needed a cup of coffee (or five) the next day, but they also got a story to tell for many nights to come.

Despite technically being banned since January, TikTok continues to torso dance its way across the United Smartphones of America. Now, in its third Trump-enabled extension, TikTok is reportedly planning to release a U.S. version of its app, if The Information‘s anonymous sources are to be believed. A U.S. version of TikTok is one of the requirements for the social network to continue offering Americans a space to discover which of Costco's products elicits more booms, the Chicken Bake or the Double Chocolate Chunk Cookie. The news comes a week after President Trump stated that a group of “very wealthy people” is looking to acquire the app, but he will not reveal their identities for another week. Our carnie government in action, folks. Current owners, ByteDance, would retain a minority stake in Trump's future propaganda firehose, satisfying Congress' Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. Phew. For a moment, we were concerned that social media apps were sharing users' web activities with adversarial governments, but it's only foreign adversarial governments. Meanwhile, per The Verge, the U.S. version is expected to hit app stores on September 5th, pending the sale's completion. Trump has already extended the deadline three times, but The Information‘s sources believe that the original app will be removed from the App Store when the new one is ready. The old TikTok, they say, will cease functioning in March 2026.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The bigger the mutant dinosaurs get, the emptier the Jurassic World films are","https://www.avclub.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-distortus-rex-is-terrible-lizard","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

Ever since Jurassic World decided that regular ol' dinosaurs just weren't good enough for its in-universe paying audience, and therefore not good enough for those continuing to pay to see these movies, the series' mutant hybrid killing machines have straddled the line between being meta-critiques of the demands on the franchise and edgelord dino bullshit. The dinos, like all movie sequels, needed to get bigger, flashier, more badass. The results have only gotten goofier. The Indominus rex—with its villainous name, cuttlefish camouflage, and brand-friendly Velociraptor DNA—at least had some natural advantages to accompany its Powder-like visage. It led to the ridiculous Indoraptor, which acted like a dinosaur serial killer for reasons beyond comprehension. The less said about Dominion‘s locusts, the better. But in Jurassic World Rebirth, a film that has fully lost the plot of all things Jurassic, the kaiju serving as the big bad of Godzilla director Gareth Edwards' film is just a mess. Its closest connection to the idea of dinosaurs is that it truly is a terrible lizard.

Before we get a nice clear look at the Fuckedupasaurus rex (actually called the Distortus rex, which is just the scientists being polite), Jurassic World Rebirth bows to franchise demands by iterating once again on the Velociraptors. This time the beasts are called Mutadons, which are kinda chubby raptors with wings. At the very least, we are spared one or more characters yelling, “They fly now?!”

But the Mutadons are simply a variation on a theme, coasting off the original film's solidification of raptors in the cultural imagination. Distortus rex, the monster that's been teased since the film's Final Destination-style cold open, is AI slop given life—DNA run through an LLM, with a bulbous beluga noggin and an extra set of arms dangling under its body. All it needs are three or four sets of double-Ds, and it would fit right at home on your uncle's Facebook feed.

“It's kind of like if the T-Rex was designed by H.R. Giger, and then that whole thing had sex with a Rancor,” director Gareth Edwards told Empire. While Rebirth does get dangerously close to showing dinosaur sex (which was in the script at one point, according to returning screenwriter David Koepp), Edwards' Hot Topic take on this beast lays bare its flaws. Rebirth is already a film focused on superlative dinos: The task force is on a fetch quest involving the biggest beasts on land, in the sea, and in the skies. Undermining these would-be wonders with the promise of an even more bloated and warped CGI creature—one less comprehensible as an animal whose movements and actions inspire a relatable natural terror in its audience—zips past the metacommentary of the previous films' mutants and crashes headlong into irony.

“You know, in the first movie I was struck by the irony that I'm writing a movie about greedy theme park people for…Universal, a profitable theme park company,” Koepp told IndieWire. The irony now exists in making a movie about a company who has strayed so far from their original specialty in order to innovate that they now seem intent on self-destruction. InGen's secret island lab, where bored scientists apparently tried to outdo each other by splicing critters who would make the least appealing toys, births not a particularly scary dinosaur, but a depressingly familiar movie monster.

What's scary about a T. rex? Overwhelming size and a jaws-first attack that activates our animal instincts. Its foil, the raptors, with their speed and teamwork and oversized talons, trigger a sense of being hunted. The flying and swimming dinos (should) offer similar gut-based reactions; we know about predatory birds and sharks. But in this context, a beefy alien-monster mishmash that simply grabs you with its regular arms isn't an escalation like it's intended to be—it's a reminder that what you're looking at through the majority of the film, dinosaurs for Christ's sake, are just an appetizer for a fast-food finale. That the climax of Jurassic World Rebirth is full of cop-outs and question marks makes this multi-legged Hell Knight from Doom even less effective.

Edwards is a monster-movie guy. His film before Godzilla was literally called Monsters. “When we first met, [Edwards] said, ‘If you come back to me with 10 different designs of a thing and at least six of them aren't ridiculous, you haven't gone far enough,'” said Rebirth visual effects supervisor David Vickery in the film's production notes. If ridiculous is the goal, why are you making a Jurassic Park movie? Nobody's complaint about the terrible Jurassic World trilogy was that the creatures didn't have enough arms, or were too easy to look at. If dinosaurs aren't good enough for your dinosaur movie, I have to question what we're all doing here in the first place.

As now seems like tradition for the nearly self-aware sequels, always seeming like they're so close to getting it, a line of dialogue aptly describes how bad things have gotten. “Nobody cares about these animals anymore,” says the film's main dino scientist. “They deserve better.” Is he talking about audiences? Filmmakers? IP stakeholders? Maybe all of the above. If this current trend continues, the next Jurassic film will be a collaboration with SYFY. Sure, the dark and twisted Distortus rex was a bust, but wait until it meets the Whalewolf.

Multiple HGTV stars impacted by major programming changes at the network, including five series cancellations announced since mid-June 2025, held their heads high over the 4th of July holiday weekend, finding the good as they face tough circumstances.

From “Bargain Block” star Keith Bynum sharing an upbeat message amid his show's cancellation to the stars of just-canceled “Married to Real Estate” hanging out with the stars of “100 Day Dream Home” in Florida, fans were inspired by the stars' resiliency and expressed hope they'd all land on their feet.

A post shared by Keith Bynum (@keithbynum_)

Bynum, co-star of “Bargain Block” with his partner Evan Thomas, told fans on July 5 that they were “starting to feel like life is going to be right again” three weeks after revealing their show was not renewed for a fifth season.

He wrote, “Hope everyone had a great 4th of July! Starting to feel like life is going to be right again. Thank you all for the thousands of messages of love and support.” 

Sharing how touched they and Shea Hicks-Whitfield, their realtor co-star, have been by the response to their show's cancellation, Bynum continued, “Me, Evan and Shea have been shocked beyond belief to see the response and we're so grateful. We love you all and just know, we're doing fine and will continue to work on houses and someday soon we'll share some new stuff 🙂 Enjoy the weekend and love to you all!”

Fans flooded Bynum's post with more support, including one who wrote, “You guys (and that includes Shea!) are the best! Not only are you entertaining to watch but what you are doing for Detroit is just amazing. I hope this isn't the last we'll be seeing you on television.”

Another commented, “We love you and you have so many people rooting for y'all. ❤️”

A post shared by Egypt Sherrod (@egyptsherrod)

On June 23, Egypt Sherrod revealed to fans via Instagram that she and her husband, Mike Jackson, had returned from a family vacation to the news from HGTV that their show, “Married to Real Estate,” had not been renewed for a fifth season. 

After processing the shock, the couple and their three daughters packed up again and headed for Florida to see friends, including a beach getaway and a dinner date with “100 Day Dream Home” stars Mika and Brian Kleinschmidt, whose series is expected to return in the fall. 

Sherrod posted multiple photos from their trip to Clearwater and St. Petersburg, writing, “Photo Dump! Clearwater Beach and St Pete owe us nothing. Just a simple break visiting family and friends while counting our blessings. ❤️❤️❤️❤️”

In the comment section, Mika wrote, “🙌❤️Power couples unite! 👏🔥” and, using her professional consulting agency account, she added, “We need to double date more often, next time we hit the town in ATL❤️🔥👏”

Sherrod and Jackson also both posted photos of them kissing on the beach, along with other family pics from their trip. On July 6, Jackson wrote on his post, “Family fun in the sun. Bothered by none. Positive vibes only.”

A post shared by Heather Rae El Moussa (@theheatherraeelmoussa)

Another duo who bonded over the 4th of July were girlfriends Alison Victoria and Taniya Nayak. The two have co-starred with Ty Pennington on “Battle on the Beach” for four seasons, but Victoria revealed on her new podcast that it, too, has not been renewed for a fifth season. 

Victoria and Nayak both posted photos in their Instagram Stories of themselves together with an ocean view behind them. The duo met filming the first season of “Battle on the Beach” in 2021, Nayak told Country Living in June 2024, before the fourth season premiered.

“I had never met Alison, and on day one, we hung out together, and we immediately became best friends,” she told the outlet. “She and I spent a lot of time outside of the show.”

Although Taniya does not have another HGTV series lined up on the network, Victoria co-stars with Retta on “Ugliest House in America” and “Scariest House in America,” and is expected to debut her new series “Sin City Rehab” in the fall. 

Meanwhile, a far more unlikely HGTV duo who've become good friends — Heather Rae El Moussa and Christina Haack — also spent the 4th of July together. Heather, who is married to Christina's ex-husband Tarek El Moussa, grew unexpectedly close with the “Christina on the Coast” star as they filmed “The Flip Off” in 2024. 

The two shared photos and videos in the Instagram feeds and Stories on July 4th from a pool party at Christina's house to fireworks that night, and celebrated winning a game of “champagne pong” against Tarek and Christina's beau, Christopher Larocca.

Dave Franco and Alison Brie are including their real-life romance in the latest trailer for their indie horror film “Together.” Collaborators and married couple Franco and Brie lead Michael Shanks' body horror Sundance hit, which they also produce. 

The official synopsis reads: “Years into their relationship, Tim and Millie (Franco and Brie) find themselves at a crossroads as they move to the country. Abandoning all that is familiar in their lives except each other. With tensions already flaring, a nightmarish encounter with a mysterious, unnatural force threatens to corrupt their lives, their love, and their flesh.”

The latest trailer incorporates personal outtakes of Franco and Brie's love story interspersed with creepy stills from the film.

Franco previously directed wife Brie in the horror movie “The Rental” and the 2023 romance “Somebody I Used to Know.” He told IndieWire that “Together,” though, was an unprecedented experience. “This was like the most full-on thing we've ever done together,” Franco said. “We're very picky about what we choose to do, especially when we're onscreen together, just because we don't want to burn people out on us.”

 










“Together” premiered at Sundance, where it was acquired by Neon. IndieWire's review by Kate Erbland called the film a “delightfully unhinged spin” on genre features. After the buzz of the film made the rounds, production, financing, and distribution company StudioFest filed a copyright lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court alleging that Brie and Franco had turned down an offer to star in the studio's film “Better Half,” which had specific parallels to “Together.” The lawsuit claimed that the actors then developed “Together” at WME with Shanks.

Writer/director Shanks issued a statement defending the film, which he wrote and had copyrighted in 2019. “Have you ever been in a relationship so long that the line between you and the other person starts to blur?” Shanks said. “I've been with my partner for over 16 years — almost half my life. That entanglement of identity, love, and co-dependence is what inspired TOGETHER. It's not just a script; it's a reflection of something deeply personal. Tim's story, his love for Millie, his relationship to his family, his relationship to unfulfilled ambitions as a musician, is completely rooted in my own personal life. I lost my father at a young age in the same way our main character does, his trauma is rooted in my own. To have this called into question is not only deeply upsetting but entirely untrue. […]  To now be accused of stealing this story — one so deeply based on my own lived experience, one I've developed over the course of several years — is devastating and has taken a heavy toll.”

 










Neon will release “Together” in theaters on Friday, July 30. Check out the latest trailer below.

Lena Dunham is looking back on claims of a lack of diversity in her iconic series “Girls.” Dunham created, produced, wrote, and starred in the HBO show, which aired from 2012 to 2017. Almost a decade after wrapping, the showrunner is reflecting on how the series was critically received at the time.

“I think one of the profound issues around ‘Girls' was that there was so little real estate for women in television,” Dunham told The Independent, “[so] that if you had a show called ‘Girls,' which is such a monolithic name, it sounds like it's describing all the girls in all the places. And so if it's not reflecting a multitude of experiences, I understand how that would be really disappointing to people.”

Dunham is now returning to TV again with her semi-autobiographical Netflix series “Too Much,” which has a large ensemble cast representing a slew of races, genders, and nationalities as the show takes place in both New York City and London. “The thing I have really come to believe is that one of the most important things is not just diversity in front of the camera, but it's diversity behind the camera,” Dunham said, citing how her experience with “Girls” impacted how she approached “Too Much.” “As a producer, one of my goals is to bring a lot of different voices into a position where they can tell their story.”

The discussions around diversity in “Girls” plagued the series ever since it premiered in 2012. The NYC-set show had a white core cast; Dunham famously introduced Donald Glover in Season 2 as one of her onscreen love interests, seemingly in direct response to the criticisms. Glover's character Sandy was a devout Republican in a subversive creative decision.

Dunham said in 2012 that the casting was not due to the diversity controversy, though. “Some are people of color, some are not, some are caucasian because I went to the actors who I wanted to work with and told the stories that seemed vital and exciting,” she said. “I don't care about satisfying the critics, but I care about satisfying my viewers. And I know I have viewers who are women of color who want to see themselves reflected onscreen. So, that's what matters to me. It doesn't matter to me to satiate people who are looking to kind of put destructive energy onto the world — not to sound like a hippie.”

Dunham added in 2018 that she later discussed Glover's character with him and wanted to make sure he was comfortable with the arc. “I emailed him later to say, ‘I hope you feel the part on “Girls” didn't tokenize you,' and his response was really Donald-y and enigmatic: ‘Let's not think back on mistakes we made in the past, let's just focus on what lies in front of us,'” she said (Glover has been vocal about his love of working with Dunham ever since starring in the series.)

 










The magnified criticisms of “Girls” at the time in part led to Dunham taking an acting hiatus. Dunham told The Times early this season, “I always joke that I need a T-shirt that says, ‘I survived New York media in 2012 and all I got was this lousy T-shirt.' And all I got was this lousy PTSD. I didn't really understand how to distinguish between what was and wasn't necessary for the public. I felt confused about how I was supposed to respond. I thought if I explain properly who I am, or give a glimpse of who I am, people are going to have a different perception of me, that we would be friends. But no one cares — and that's fine.”

James Gunn is shutting down the assumption that “Superman” has to be a box office blockbuster. The writer/director, who is also the co-head of DC Studios alongside Peter Safran, told GQ that the franchise tentpole film does not carry as much pressure at the studio as critics believe. 

“Is there something riding on it? Yeah, but it's not as big as people make it out to be,” Gunn said. “They hear these numbers that the movie's only going to be successful if it makes $700 million or something and it's just complete and utter nonsense. It doesn't need to be as big of a situation as people are saying.”

 










He added that rebooting “Superman” was “not the riskiest endeavor in the world.” David Corenswet stars as the title character superhero for the film that had a reported budget in the $200 million range, as Variety stated. “Superman” opens in theaters July 11 from Warner Bros. and DC Studios.

Gunn recently has been promoting “Superman” as a truly patriotic film, telling The Times that the storyline embodies “the story of America.” 

 










“I mean, ‘Superman' is the story of America,” Gunn said. “An immigrant that came from other places and populated the country, but for me it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost. It's about human kindness and obviously there will be jerks out there who are just not kind and will take it as offensive just because it is about kindness. But screw them.” 

He added, “Yes, it's about politics. But on another level it's about morality. Do you never kill no matter what — which is what Superman believes — or do you have some balance, as Lois believes? It's really about their relationship and the way different opinions on basic moral beliefs can tear two people apart.”

Gunn further told Rolling Stone that unlike Disney's MCU, WBD does not have a quota for DCU films. Therefore, “Superman” was only released when it was ready by Gunn's standards. 

“We don't have the mandate [at DC] to have a certain amount of movies and TV shows every year. So we're going to put out everything that we think is of the highest quality. We're obviously going to do some good things and some not-so-good things, but hopefully on average everything will be as high-quality as possible,” Gunn said. “Nothing goes before there's a screenplay that I personally am happy with.”

 










And out of all of the DCU characters, Superman isn't the most important for this next phase of the IP. “Batman's my biggest issue in all of DC right now, personally,” Gunn said. “I'm not writing ‘Batman,' but I am working with the writer of ‘Batman' [Matt Reeves] and trying to get it right, because he's incredibly important to DC, as is Wonder Woman. So outside of the stuff that I'm doing in the projects that are actively going, our two priorities are finishing our ‘Wonder Woman' and our ‘Batman' scripts.”

Anne Hathaway had to shed her Oscar-winning musical background for David Lowery's “Mother Mary.” The indie film, which centers on Hathaway's pop star character, features original songs written by Charli XCX and Jack Antonoff. While Hathaway did record the vocals for the tracks, the music was not finalized during the filming of “Mother Mary,” leading Hathaway to ad-lib the onscreen singing scenes.

“It was so confusing. I had to learn,” she told Vogue. “Because if I'd had the music a year before we ever turned a camera on, I would have tattooed every note of it on my soul, and there would have been a whole process, very specific. And that was not available to me. In the end. I am very grateful I could not take control.”

The “Odyssey” actress actually had to tap into relearning certain parts of acting. “I had to submit to being a beginner,” she said. “The humility of that — showing up every day knowing you're going to suck. And it has to be OK. You're not ‘bad.' You're just a beginner. Getting to that mindset — I had to shed some things that were hard to shed. It was welcome. But it was hard, the way transformational experiences can be hard.”

Hathaway's character is described as “a sort of Gaga–Taylor Swift hybrid.” Michaela Coel plays a fashion designer who becomes entangled in Mother Mary's web. Coel, who went to techno clubs with Hathaway to prepare for her role, said that “it's very brave work that [Hathaway has] done.” 

Writer/director Lowery even cited just how intense the production got at one point. While shooting a pivotal scene for the end of the film, Hathaway became fully immersed in the moment. “At one point Annie broke down and said, ‘I have to apologize, because I think what's going to come out of me will hurt you,'” Lowery recalled. “And Michaela took her hands and said, ‘I love you, I trust you.'” 

Lowery added, “It felt like shooting ‘Apocalypse Now.'” 

The filmmaker previously said during the Melbourne International Film Festival that “Mother Mary” is a “weird, weird film,” that is in part inspired by Francis Ford Coppola's “Bram Stoker's Dracula.”

“I'm in the edit right now [for ‘Mother Mary'] and I have been wondering, ‘What is this movie?'” Lowery said. “I know what I set out to make and that is indeed what I've made, but it is so wild. It is a movie I am sure will provoke a lot of strong feelings, in every possible direction. It feels very true to who I am, and very close to me, but it is also consistently surprising me in ways that I did not anticipate.”

It's exciting when a new auteur emerges on the film scene. Greta Gerwig took the leap from acting to writing and directing back in 2017 with “Lady Bird,” and now actress Embeth Davidtz, who broke out back in 1993 with “Schindler's List,” and since then has starred in “Matilda” (1996), “Bridget Jones Diary” (2001), and tons of TV, including the recent “The Morning Show,” has emerged as an auteur in her own right with “Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight.” 

Davidtz adapted the 2001 Alexandra Fuller bestselling memoir of the same name over eight years, after many others, including the author, tried and failed.

That time was well-spent. The final result, which debuted to raves at the Telluride and Toronto festivals last fall, is a detailed, specific, visually rich, and immersive dive into a time and place: war-torn Rhodesia/Zimbabwe in 1980. A once peacefully settled farm family is now in terrible danger from the civil war erupting around them. While the stressed-out white parents (Davidtz and Andreas Damm) sleep with guns by their beds, their feral daughter Bobo (discovery Lexi Venter) plays with her dog and local housekeeper Sarah (Zikhona Bali), whose loyalty is hard to parse.

The filmmaker's breakthrough: anchoring the narrative on the eight-year-old Bobo. By focusing on the Rhodesian farm girl, Davidtz found herself, too. 

The film, while based on Fuller's life, is also rooted in Davidtz's experience moving to South Africa at the same age, and confronting a baffling, racist culture. She is attending the opening in South Africa with her family, partly so her two grown kids can visit their grandparents.

Davidtz felt compelled to adapt Fuller's memoir herself. “It's such a mirror image of my own [life],” she told IndieWire. “The reason I fell in love with the story was because, even the child that I found to play Bobo looked like me at that age. Though the war, the mother, the mental illness, the alcoholism, the relationship to Zimbabwe, that was Alexandra's story, mine was a child put into this unequal place, alcoholism in the family, the loneliness, the unsupervised childhood, where things felt so scary and so much could go wrong.”

While Davidtz and Fuller bonded over their shared experiences, “I have to be careful to always distinguish between my story and hers,” said Davidtz. “They have blended at this stage.”

Davidtz did not hesitate to make the film her own. “I kept telling it from the outside, the third person, trying to explain and show,” she said. “I remember one day thinking, ‘This isn't working.' What did it was the opening line: ‘Mum says we mustn't come creeping into her room at night.' What if that was the voice? What if I wrote everything from that point of view? It changed everything once I did that.”

 










Where did these hidden writing and directing skills come from? “I've always written,” she said. “I loved English at university [Rhodes University]. I've actually got a little novella that I've whittled away at. But acting always took me away from it. Acting is distracting.”

While Davidtz's acting resume is extensive, over the last 20 years she took time to raise her kids. She battled breast cancer. And over the last eight years, she tackled Final Draft. “Very slow,” she said. “I'm a slow writer. I'm slow with technology. But the book gave me the scaffolding to pick the sliver of time that I wanted to tell the story in, and then pull and cherry pick the pieces that were the most interesting dramatically.”

The filmmaker invested her own money in the project. “My husband [attorney Jason Sloane] kindly threw in a bit, and we had one person who had a little bit of money, not a lot, and we ended up doing it for about $1.4 million, U.S. And there's a good exchange rate,” she said.

Proceeding on the movie hinged on a stroke of luck. “I took a Starz Network job [‘The Venery of Samantha Bird'],” she said. “It was a good, well-written pilot, which was then going to be an eight-part series, and we got most of the way through it. Then they got in trouble with the writing, and they fired the showrunner, and then the strike happened. I took that job because I said, ‘Whatever I make on this is going to hire me the DP and the camera package that I want.' That job that I shot in the five months, went away. They were not airing it because it didn't get finished. It wasn't very good, but I got the money. So [the financing] was cobbled together.”

 










Davidtz shot the film mostly around one farm in South Africa. “We got the one house, the one location, that land that we rented with that messed-up old house,” she said. “I had a brilliant set designer. She decorated this set, but all of it was old, broken stuff. So we somehow managed.”

When she searched for the right cinematographer, she “pulled family photographs from the late '70s with those great saturated colors,” she said. “Willie Nel came along, and I started talking about the way Peter Weir shot ‘Picnic at Hanging Rock.' I could see the dust and the dirt and the light. And he started talking the same language back at me.”

Nell proposed they acquire a costly lens package, the Black Wing Tribe 7. “It's a Panavision lens that has this way of filming so that the edges fall off,” said Davidtz. “You get a lot of those flares, but it gives you that vintage feeling. So it feels like we were looking at footage from the late '70s, early '80s.”

One hurdle Davidtz encountered while shooting was the child labor law which kept the work, according to Venter's parents, to only three hours a day. “I nearly had a nervous breakdown about it,” Davidtz said. “Everything around that child was so beautiful that I wished we'd had more leeway. But we still did it. It made me even more laser-focused to get it done, to ensure we were economical with her. By the time I had to shoot my hard scenes, which were later, you see it in my face: I've been through the ringer of just trying to carry this thing and keep it light for the child, because you can't burden a seven-year-old with whatever's going on behind the scenes. She couldn't read upset in me, and so I had to put it somewhere else. I was nicely worn down by the end to shoot the scenes of myself. I had no director. I had to direct myself. I couldn't watch it. I had no time to watch it back. I looked a little roughed up. And it helped.”

 










At the end of the movie, the family are expelled from the Garden of Eden. “They didn't belong there,” said Davidtz. “Sarah doesn't believe in the Garden of Eden, that Adam and Eve wore leaves on their private parts. The African believes in Maori and Earth. So there's the African thought process, and the European thought process, and it's the collision of the two. And ultimately, the whites had to capitulate, they had to leave. For anybody who has lived in Africa and no longer lives there, you are always separated. You feel separated from God. You feel separated from the thing that you've loved. I live in America, and I always feel I'm not connected to the thing that I grew up loving. But I can't live there anymore.”

It was tough for Davidtz, shooting some of the things her racist character does in the movie in front of the all-Black crew. “I felt embarrassed at times, and filled with shame,” she said. “We laughed, and we hugged, and I kept saying, ‘I'm sorry.'”

The experience of telling this story was cathartic. “So healing,” said Davidtz. “You don't think that's real. You don't think something can heal, but it does. I remember being a child much like Lexi is, like Alexandra Fuller was,” said Davidtz. “Far too young, becoming aware of sexual tensions in the air, with adults being drunk and being sexual with each other, with children being the objects of sexual attention from gross old uncles.”

 










Luckily the child actors were kept separate from the adult material. “Lexi was blissfully unaware of most of what she was doing,” said Davidtz. “It's a sleight of hand with this deep, smart, and sensitive child to tell her enough, but not too much. I'd throw the lines to her, but keep her in play mode. Put her in a tub of water, give her dolls to play with, shoes, put her under that table with her dog. It was her own dog. And give her scarves, I said, ‘Tie the scarf on the dog, stick the feather up the guy's leg,' and then I can use the voiceover, which I could add later.”

Having mined her traumatic childhood, Davidtz is ready to move on to other phases of her life. “I'm a middle-aged woman,” she said. “A lot has happened since [age] seven: from men and the complexities of being female, to being a mother, to losing your way, and then finding your way back again. I'm trying to get the rights to an Alice Munro short story. I always want to work with the money I've cobbled together without someone telling me: ‘Here's $50 million, but you've got to tell this story.' I'm so scared of that. Everybody said, ‘Don't go near something that covers race.' And I said, ‘I know if I tell it the right way, I can tell the story.'”

Sony Pictures Classics is sending Davidtz on the road with the movie. And Trevor Noah has come on as an executive producer. She told him: “If you can get some word out on this film, and if you want to put your name on it, just let the world know about it.” And SPC knows how to pay the awards game when the time comes. 

 










Next up: With her work on “The Morning Show” finished, Davidtz has cleared the decks for more writing. “There's nothing in my way, which is great,” she said. “Acting is distracting, you've got to pay attention to what you're doing. So it would have taken me away. I'm so happy there's nothing else except this on my plate right now and what I can write in my spare time.”

Her agents sent her a couple of action scripts. “I would be bad at this,” she said. “I can't. No thanks. So the poor agents feel deflated if you say ‘no' a few times. When I find the right thing, I will know it.”

Sony Pictures Classics will release “Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight” in theaters on Friday, July 11.

							By 

	Jon Blistein



	At least 80 people have died, including more than two dozen campers and counselors from an all-girls Christian summer camp, in the floods that devastated central Texas over the July Fourth weekend.


	The deluge that ripped through the Texas Hill Country is already considered one of the deadliest floods in the U.S. in the past 100 years. There remain concerns that more rain in the coming days could cause additional destruction. Rescue efforts continued Monday, July 7, under a fresh slate of flash flood warnings.


	As The Associated Press reports, the Texas Hill Country is particularly prone to flash flooding, as the dry soil there isn't able to soak up heavy rainfall. An early morning storm Friday, July 4, dropped 12 inches of rain that poured down the hills into the Guadalupe River, causing it to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes. 


	The worst damage so far has been along the Guadalupe in Kerr County, northwest of San Antonio. On Monday, Sheriff Larry Leitha said that 48 adults and 27 children had died in the floods, adding that many of the deceased still needed to be identified. 

	











	Also on Monday, Camp Mystic, the all-girls Christian summer camp, confirmed that 27 campers and counselors had died in the flooding. Ten campers and one counselor remain missing. 


	“Our hearts are broken alongside our families that are enduring this unimaginable tragedy,” the camp said in a statement. “We are praying for them constantly. We have been in communication with local and state authorities who are tirelessly deploying extensive resources to search for our missing girls. We are deeply grateful for the outpouring of support from community, first responders, and officials at every level.”

	











	Additional deaths have been reported in Travis County, Burnet County, Kendall County, Williamson County, and Tom Green County. Many more remain missing. 


	Flood survivors have begun to ask why they didn't receive sufficient flash flood warnings. While an initial flood watch alert was sent out by the National Weather Service on Thursday afternoon, July 3, it wasn't until 4 a.m. on July 4 that an urgent warning was finally sent.


	As The New York Times noted, several key positions at local NWS offices were vacant. That included the warning coordination meteorologist at the San Antonio office, who left in April after taking a retirement package offered by the Trump administration as part of their efforts to cut the number of federal employees.

	Speaking with reporters Sunday night, President Trump dismissed the possibility that federal cuts played some role in hindering disaster response “They didn't,” he said (via Reuters) before adding, “You look at that water situation, that was really the Biden setup. That was not our setup. But I wouldn't blame Biden for it either; I would just say this is a hundred-year catastrophe, and it's just so horrible to watch.” 


	Trump has issued a major disaster declaration to assist with rescue and relief efforts. The president is expected to visit Texas later this week.

When What We Do in the Shadows hit theaters in the U.S. back in 2015, it became an immediate hit. Created by Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi, the mockumentary brought something fresh to an otherwise stagnant subgenre, and is today regarded as one of the best horror comedies ever made. The spin-off series of the same name that hit FX in 2019 enjoyed similar, if not greater success, but in between the two, there was another short-lived spin-off you may have either missed, or forgotten about completely: Wellington Paranormal.

Starring Mike Minogue and Karen O'Leary as Officers Minogue and O'Leary from the feature film, Wellington Paranormal traces a group of New Zealand police investigators who track supernatural events, including cases of demon possession, haunted houses, and blood bank robberies. Lasting for four seasons and a Christmas special, the series maintains the mockumentary format as it introduces viewers to a new crop of hilarious threats, and while it's been available to stream on Hulu for a while, fans can also check it out now on its new streaming home of HBO Max.

Fans of the Staten Island Coven may enjoy other series of ghosts, angels, and pirates.

Also starring Maaka Pohatu and Tom Sainsbury, Wellington Paranormal featured Clement lending his voice to Mobot, and Rhys Darby reprising his character of Anton from What We Do in the Shadows. However, it was O'Leary and Minogue who were front and center in this one, and rightfully so. Their bumbling antics and the way they approached the paranormal endeared them to viewers, who praised the series for being hilarious and wholesome as it explored ridiculous plots like zombies in a supermarket, and parodied such greats as Invasion of the Body Snatchers.

Debuting on The CW back in 2021, Wellington Paranormal was first broadcast on TVNZ 2 in New Zealand in 2018. Though it only lasted for 25 episodes, it clearly left its mark on the horror comedy subgenre, as is evident by its 98% Rotten Tomatoes score. Critic Valerie Ettenhofer from Film School Rejects called it a ""drolly-funny cross-genre series with all the trappings of a cult classic,"" and it's indeed become just that. Daniel Kurland from Bloody Disgusting was another who had high praise for the series, writing:

""Wellington Paranormal is more than just a hackneyed spin-off and it contains some of the best jokes and strongest writing out of the entirety of the What We Do in the Shadows universe.""

Also called ""refreshingly silly and never pretentious"" by critic Brian Tallerico from RogerEbert.com, Wellington Paranormal is best summed up as a blend of The Office and The X-Files, but it's so much more. While it's choked full of laughs and absurdity, underneath are themes of xenophobia, bureaucratic maladroitness, and the banality of the inexplicable, all which work to create a series that's as funny as it is thought-provoking. Trust us, the episodes may be short, but when examined under a microscope, you'll quickly realize that Clement and Waititi have a lot to say.

All four seasons of Wellington Paranormal, including the Christmas special, are now available to stream on HBO Max.

Before 'Wheel of Time,' this show was canceled far to early, and according to its star had already started work on Season 2. 

The series was pitched as Netflix's answer to 'The Pitt.'

The actor admits it's going to be weird when his Prime Video series 'The Boys' finally comes to a conclusion.

Episode 2 is our favorite so far thanks to that epic sauna scene.","{'href': 'https://movieweb.com', 'title': 'MovieWeb'}","other"

Work has begun to design and build a Double-Walled Isolator (DWI), akin to an ultra-clean miniature laboratory to safely store and analyse extra-terrestrial materials, such as the first material from Mars.

University of Leicester scientists have passed a key European Space Agency review, and now will proceed to design the Qualification Model of a Double-Walled Isolator that could handle and curate samples from a Mars Sample Return mission.

The €5 million project will see a team working at Space Park Leicester, the University's pioneering £100 million science and innovation park, to design, build and test the system.

The Double Walled Isolator is effectively a miniature laboratory designed to store and handle returned extra-terrestrial samples, and notionally samples from Mars, at a high level of containment and cleanliness. It is vital to avoid cross-contamination to properly study the precious samples and so the DWI will be designed to drastically reduce interactions with human beings by using state of the art robotics.

A robotic arm and other manipulation technologies will be used to move the samples around the inert gas environment of the DWI so that samples can be analysed by an optical microscope and a Raman spectrometer to provide information about the chemistry and geology of the rock material.

Initially developed in the framework of Mars Sample Return (MSR), this project also builds on previous work that the Leicester team has undertaken in designing a prototype Double Walled Isolator. For the Qualification Model, the Leicester team will be involving a diverse array of subject matter experts from the Open University, the Francis Crick Institute, Imperial College London and the Natural History Museum.

Extract Technologies in Huddersfield are the industrial partner for the project who will provide detailed design and manufacture of the main isolator. Their expertise is in building advanced isolator technologies for the nuclear and pharmaceutical and medical industry, which has similar technical challenges of containment and cleanliness.

The team has now successfully completed a System Requirements Review, which closes the first formal phase of the project and it is now moving on to the design phase.

Andrew Cheney, DWI QM Project Manager at Space Park Leicester, said: “The SRR is a major milestone for the project that shows that we've fully understood the customer need, and translated that into a set of requirements to proceed with confidence into the design phase. Generating a good set of requirements is arguably the hardest part of any project and takes a lot of research, analysis and industry expertise. Now we have that agreed baseline, we look forward to the design phase and the many, many challenges it will bring for this unique piece of equipment.

“We have a relatively compressed period now to push a concept through to detail design and manufacture. The dedicated qualification phase will involve simulating end-to-end curatorial and scientific processing of martian analogue samples at SPL.”

John Holt, DWI QM Principal Investigator at Space Park Leicester, said: “Whether or not an astronaut or a robotic spacecraft brings samples back from Mars, the Double Walled Isolator (DWI) is a key UK technology that enables planetary scientists to scrutinise returned rocks to understand the martian environment and if there is microscopic evidence for life on the red planet.

The milestone review [SRR] we have just conducted carefully looked at the complex needs of scientists to ensure we design an ultra-clean system that allows them to handle the precious samples and use a wide range of analytical techniques to unlock the secrets within each piece of rock. Out of this world projects are only possible with the right team and that is what we have here at Space Park Leicester, with our industry partner, Extract Technology, and scientific collaborators at the Open University, the Francis Crick Institute, Imperial College London and the Natural History Museum.”

Darren Hughes, Managing Director of Extract Technology Ltd, said: “I am delighted that DEC Group Extract Technology have been chosen as the partner of choice for Space Park Leicester in the design, development and manufacture of the DWI.

“Working in collaboration with world leading academics and scientific experts, as well as leveraging our decades of experience and knowledge in providing true end to end solutions in environments that require levels of extremely high containment.

“We are as equally proud that the final design will be built at our UK facility in Huddersfield, a testament to the skills and expertise within our business to enable us to deliver on such a prestigious project.”

What new methods can be developed in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI)? This is what a recent white paper submitted to the 2025 NASA Decadal Astrobiology Research and Exploration Strategy (DARES) Request for Information (RFI) hopes to address, as a pair of researchers from the Breakthrough Listen project and Michigan State University, discussed how high-energy astronomy could be used for identifying radio signals from an extraterrestrial technological civilization, also called technosignatures. This study has the potential to help SETI and other organizations develop novel techniques for finding intelligent life beyond Earth.

The work is published on the arXiv preprint server.

For the white paper, the researchers evaluated why high-energy astronomy, which involves celestial objects emitting cosmic rays, gamma rays, and X-rays, could be used by SETI for identifying technosignatures, noting how its use has grown in recent years.

Additionally, they discussed the potential sources of high-energy emissions, including neutrinos, X-rays, cosmic rays, gamma rays, pulsar wind nebulae, neutron stars, black holes, solar flares, and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Regarding how this contributes to specifically identifying technosignatures, the researchers note how high-energy signals could be indicative of a form of communication, industry, and habitat.

For communication, high-energy signals could be indicative of a technosignature since high-energy signals are often needed to send large amounts of data. For industry, high-energy signals could be indicative of specific activities, including rockets, reactors, nuclear energy, accelerators, or even Dyson spheres and star engines, with the last two being far beyond Earth's technological capabilities.

For habitat, high-energy signals could be indicative of life on the surface of neutron stars that survive from nuclear energy and the radiation that neutron stars emit. Finally, the researchers discussed next steps for integrating high-energy astronomy into SETI, including using machine learning, searching X-ray images, neutrino bursts, and gamma-ray observations.

The study notes, ""High-energy SETI by and large must be a commensal effort for the foreseeable future. Dedicated programs will only be feasible after much further investigation. At this stage, our efforts will be like those of the early radio and optical SETI pioneers who developed methods and infrastructure that took decades to grow into the robust subfield it is today.

""An even more basic reason for commensal studies is the difficulty in building optics for some kinds of radiation. Because we cannot make neutrino lenses, every neutrino detector is sensitive to large sky areas, making it a commensal SETI facility.""

The driving force behind SETI is the SETI Institute, which was founded in 1984 with the goal of scanning the heavens for signals that could indicate intelligent life beyond Earth. While no definitive signals have been identified, arguably the closest humanity has come to receiving a signal from another world that occurred seven years before the SETI Institute was founded.

This was quickly known as the Wow! Signal, which was a radio signal that lasted over one minute and was received by the Big Ear radio telescope at Ohio State University. This signal was so powerful that the discovering astronomy intern, Jerry Ehman, wrote the word ""Wow!"" across the data readout. Despite repeated attempts, the astronomers at Big Ear were unable to identify the same signal again, and a signal of this strength and length has yet to be identified since then.

As the search for technosignatures continues, this white paper demonstrates how SETI could enhance and adapt its techniques for identifying intelligent life beyond Earth, specifically using methods that perhaps once seemed unnecessary or unreliable.

Since traditional techniques of searching for radio signals on specific frequencies have shown zero results, perhaps high-energy astronomy could open the door to help astronomers better understand the universe aside from searching for technosignatures.

BySara Dorn,

 Forbes Staff. 

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., fueled an ongoing conspiracy among the far-right—that the government is behind some of the worst natural disasters—when she said she would introduce legislation to prevent government “weather modification and geoengineering” in the wake of the deadly Texas floods.  

Greene wrote in a Saturday post on X.she would introduce legislation that bans the release of anything into “the atmosphere for the express purpose of altering weather, temperature, climate, or sunlight intensity,” saying, “no person, company, entity, or government should ever be allowed to modify our weather by any means possible!!” 

Greene did not reference the deadly Texas floods dominating the news that day, but said she has been “working with the legislative counsel for months writing this bill” to make “the dangerous and deadly practice of weather modification and geoengineering” a “felony offense.”

The Georgia congresswoman said the bill would be similar to Florida's new law that makes cloud seeding and other weather modification activities illegal.

Greene has a history of stoking conspiracies that a government “deep state” creates catastrophic weather events, including suggesting hurricanes have been engineered to hit Republican areas harder than those with more Democrats and speculating that lasers spark wildfires.

The conspiracy that weather is manipulated by forces other than nature has been repeatedly debunked amid an increase in dangerous weather caused by climate change: “NOAA does not fund or participate in cloud seeding or other weather modification projects,”  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration writes on its website.

Meteorologist Matthew Cappucci blasted Greene in a series of posts on X, explaining that the practice of cloud seeding—or injecting particles in the air to encourage rain or snow—is only possible on a small scale, and can't cause the kind of devastation seen in Texas over the weekend. “Cloud seeing is for a tiny cloud—not a 4,000,000,000,000 gallon flood,” he wrote on X. Cappucci, who has spoken out to debunk the weather modification theories in the past, added that “it's not a political statement for me as a Harvard-degreed atmospheric scientist to say that elected representative Marjorie Taylor Green[e] doesn't know what the hell she's talking about.” Cloud seeding is typically done by private companies to generate snow in mountain basins in winter and rain in reservoirs during the summer and has been “used for decades,” according to NOAA.

Greene has suggested previously that catastrophic weather events are tied to intentional weather modification. In the wake of Hurricane Helene in October, she tweeted “yes they can control the weather . . . it's ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can't be done,” without specifying who “they” is. In an earlier post, she suggested Democrats were to blame by posting a map of hurricane damage across the southeastern U.S. she said proved that Republican areas were hit harder than those with more Democrats. Weather-manipulation theories proliferated by some right-wing figures date back at least to Hurricane Ida in 2021, when QAnon conspiracy theorists pushed the idea that it was somehow geoengineered for political purposes.

In a since-deleted 2018 Facebook post, Greene questioned whether “lasers or blue beams of light” funded by the Rothschild Jewish banking family caused the Butte County, California, Camp Fire in 2018 that killed 85 people—Greene was widely ridiculed for spreading the unfounded suggestion, which became known as the “Jewish space lasers” conspiracy. The conspiracy that “directed energy weapons” are the cause of wildfires also surfaced on social media during the deadly Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year, during the Maui and Canadian fires in 2023 and the Texas Smokehouse Creek Wildfire in 2024, CBS notes.

Yes. According to NOAA, “between 1962 and 1982, NOAA provided support for research into whether hurricane intensity could be modified, known as Project STORMFURY,” but it was unsuccessful, and “STORMFURY was discontinued.” NOAA notes that cloud deeding does occur —”typically by private companies in western mountain basins in winter in order to help generate snow in specific locations, or in the desert southwest to replenish water reservoirs in summer,” and has happened for decades. 

At least 82 people, including 28 children and 27 campers and counselors from Camp Mystic summer camp on the banks of the Guadalupe River, were killed in the central Texas flash floods that began Friday, while 10 campers remain unaccounted for. The death toll is expected to rise as search and rescue efforts continue. A flash flooding threat remains in effect through Monday, with the possibility of additional heavy downpour.

As the sun beamed down over Cincinnati on Saturday, there were no dry eyes for the family of Alan Holcomb.

Saturday marked two years since the 39-year-old was shot and killed inside his apartment complex in Hartwell. No suspects were ever arrested in his murder.

“I was always his protector, like he used to always call me the ‘enforcer' of the family,” said Holcomb's cousin Kisha Ivory. “So, now in this moment, like, I don't feel like I did my job protecting him.”

For as long as we've been able to ask big questions, humans have wondered: is there life after death? Religion has long offered an answer—promising that death is not the end, but a gateway to something more.

Today, a new idea is emerging from Silicon Valley. Tech visionaries are promoting transhumanism—the belief that if an afterlife doesn't exist, perhaps it can be built. Through AI, robotics, and nanotechnology, they hope to transcend biology and digitally preserve the human mind.

But is this the future of humanity, or just high-tech science fiction?

Piers Morgan hosts a debate between neurosurgeon Michael Egnor, who is convinced that consciousness exists beyond our mortal bodies, and Michael Shermer, who is far more skeptical.

Ukraine has submitted to Germany a “secret list” containing a broad array of advanced weapons that it wishes to obtain, Bild has reported, citing a copy obtained by the outlet.

Since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022, Berlin has been the second largest supplier of arms to Kiev, surpassed only by the US.

In an article on Sunday, Bild claimed that the list is divided into three categories: air defense, armored vehicles, and electronic warfare. According to the tabloid, the requested weapons are worth billions of euros, though it is not clear at this point whether Berlin will fulfill Kiev's supposed wish list.

The media outlet reported that while anonymous “military circles and industry have confirmed the existence of the list,” a spokesperson for Germany's Defense Ministry declined to comment on the matter.

Among the weapons requested are 1,500 medium-range and 500 short-range missiles for various modifications of the German-made Iris-T air defense system, Bild claimed. Ukraine is also reportedly seeking 1,200 mine-protected and tracked vehicles, plus an additional 200 off-road vehicles.

Kiev's wish list also includes 1,000 GPS jammers and 200 mobile surveillance radars, according to the outlet.

Last week, Bild, citing unnamed sources, claimed that Chancellor Friedrich Merz's government had quietly approached US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in June at the behest of Ukrainian officials. According to the media outlet, Kiev hoped that Washington would agree to a deal under which Berlin would purchase two US-made Patriot air defense systems that would subsequently be handed over to Ukraine.

Speaking last Friday, German government spokesman Stefan Kornelius acknowledged that “intensive discussions” were taking place between Berlin and Washington regarding such an arrangement.

In May, Germany's Defense Ministry announced that it would provide €5 billion ($5.6 billion) to “finance the production of long-range weapon systems in Ukraine.”

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov condemned the decision, saying that Germany is “competing with France for primacy in further provoking war.”

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov similarly stated that Berlin's “direct involvement in the war is now obvious.”

“Germany is sliding down the same slippery slope it already followed a couple of times in the last century – down toward its own collapse,” the diplomat warned in late May.

Moscow has consistently condemned Western arms deliveries to Ukraine, arguing that they fuel more bloodshed and obstruct peace efforts.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, discusses ongoing search and rescue efforts as death tolls in Texas floods rise to over 80. 

Democrats and media outlets across the country have been quick to politicize the devastating flooding in Texas that killed at least 91 people by blaming climate change, President Trump, race and government cuts. 

""It is hard to make the Texas flood tragedy worse, except to know that on the same day Trump signed a bill cratering solar and wind energy that is vital in the battle against the climate change making these torrential rains more frequent,"" former Washington Gov. Jay Inslee posted on X on Saturday as bodies were still being recovered in Texas. 

""I think climate change is obviously a part of it,"" Dem. Rep. Joaquin Castro told CNN. ""These floods are happening more often.""

""'Waste, fraud & abuse' is a handy mantra,"" Former Obama aide David Axelrod posted on X on Sunday. ""And they surely exist, in & out of government. But cutting vital services like the weather service has predictable, hazardous consequences – especially when catastrophic weather events are becoming more frequent!""

""Accurate weather forecasting helps avoid fatal disasters,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on X in response to reports that a specific meteorologist position in the area was unfilled at the time of the flood. ""There are consequences to Trump's brainless attacks on public workers, like meteorologists.""

Murphy was one of several critics on the left to invoke Trump's name. 

""It only took 9 days for Trump's cuts to the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] to kill dozens of children in Texas when Tropical Storm Barry landed this week,"" Grant Stern, the executive editor of Occupy Democrats, wrote on X. 

""The people in Texas voted for government services controlled by Donald Trump and Greg Abbott,"" added Ron Filipkowski, former federal prosecutor and the editor-in-chief of MediasTouchNews. ""That is exactly what they (sic) getting."" 

Isaiah Martin, a Democratic candidate for Texas's 18th Congressional District, called for an immediate congressional investigation into ""the Republican DOGE cuts to NOAA and the National Weather Service.""

""We saw the affects (sic) this weekend,"" Martin wrote on X. ""Trump defunded these agencies and we DEMAND answers. There MUST be *swift* accountability!"" 

""Trump & Musk gutted the National Weather Service. The result was predictable: A bad forecast leading to the death of children in a horrific flood,"" added California state Sen. Scott Wiener.

Additionally, several media outlets joined Democrats in placing blame on budget cuts and suggesting the National Weather Service was understaffed at the time of the flooding despite an Associated Press report that said the NWS office in the area had extra staff on duty at the time of the flooding.

""Reminder: The staffing shortages at the National Weather Service's San Angelo and San Antonio offices doubled under the Trump administration,"" the official X account of the Democratic Party wrote on X in a post that was lambasted by conservatives on social media. ""These jobs are meant to coordinate disaster response and save lives.""

""The Big Ugly Bill's elimination of climate action laws and cutbacks in the National Weather Service couldn't come at a worse time as the deadly flooding in Texas has shown,"" Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., posted on X. ""Those incidents are likely to get worse as Republicans ignore the reality of climate change.""

Some incorporated race into the equation, including Sade Perkins, a former member of the Houston Food Insecurity Board, who suggested in a heavily criticized video the intense media coverage of the event was because the young girls who were killed at a summer camp in the flood's path were White. 

Several meteorologists have pushed back in recent days on Democratic claims that Trump administration cuts to NOAA, NWS and other government agencies directly contributed to the tragedy. 

""The event has nothing to do with climate change,"" meteorologist Chris Martz posted on X. ""And, the tragedy had nothing to do with DOGE cuts.If you are someone who has exploited this catastrophe because you just don't like Trump, you need to take a serious look in the mirror.""

Tom Fahy, legislative director for the National Weather Service Employees Organization, told NBC News that weather forecasting offices were adequately staffed, and ""they issued timely forecasts and warnings leading up to the storm,"" but he added that unfilled leadership positions were ""clearly a concern.""

""All I'll say is this. The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for Kerr County more than 12 hours ahead of the catastrophic flood. A flash flood warning was issued for Hunt & Ingram 3 HOURS before the Guadalupe started to climb,"" said Texas-based meteorologist Avery Tomasco. ""They did their job and they did it well.""

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson called it ""shameful and disgusting"" to see that, in the wake of this tragedy, people are politicizing what took place.

﻿""It's shameful and disgusting that in the wake of tragedy, the left's first instinct is to lie and politicize a disaster to target their political opponents. False claims about the NWS have been repeatedly debunked by meteorologists, experts and other public reporting,"" Jackson said. ""The NWS did their job, even issuing a flood watch more than 12 hours in advance. The Trump administration is grateful to the first responders who sprung into action to save hundreds of lives during this catastrophe, and will continue to help the great state of Texas in their recovery efforts.""

In a lengthy thread on X outlining the timing of the government's response, the Department of Homeland Security said ""the mainstream media is deliberately lying about the events leading up to the catastrophic flooding in Texas.""

Sprawl made suburbia affordable. Now it's breaking it. Here's what a new vision of the suburbs could look like.

For the last half-century, America's population growth has been concentrated in the sweltering, equal parts bone-dry and waterlogged, yet ever-sprawling Sunbelt. Undeterred by the limits of hydrology or climate, metro areas from Las Vegas to Miami have gotten one thing undeniably right. They have long led the country in housing construction, resulting in a relative plenitude and affordability that shames coastal cities in California and the Northeast, as well as a booming industry of takes imploring blue cities to learn from red states on housing.

But that abundance is already becoming a thing of the past. Across Sunbelt metros like Phoenix, Dallas, and Atlanta, housing supply growth has actually plummeted since the early 2000s, to rates almost as low as in hyper-expensive coastal cities, according to a new working paper by the leading urban economists Edward Glaeser and Joe Gyourko. Housing costs in these metros, while still lower than major coastal cities, have surged as a result. 

Gyourko, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School who decades ago documented slowing housing growth in superstar cities like New York and San Francisco, told me he was surprised to find the same pattern again unfolding, as if on a 20-year lag, in a region known for its lax regulations and enthusiasm for building things. Looking at the data, he thought, “Wow, Phoenix and Miami look like LA did as it was gentrifying in the '80s.” 

Although metro Phoenix, to unpack one example, is building a similar absolute number of homes as it did in the early 2000s, its population has grown by more than 58 percent since the turn of the century, so as a share of its current housing stock — the number that most matters, Gyourko says — it's now building far less. If that trend continues even as demand to live in the Sunbelt remains undimmed, he said, “you would expect them to start to look more and more like Los Angeles.” By 2045, Arizona might be facing unaffordability and population loss crises much like those choking California today. 

For many years, suburbs and exurbs have been the leading drivers of housing growth in Sunbelt cities, capturing most of the new population moving to the region. “The concepts ‘Sunbelt city' and ‘suburb' are nearly synonymous,” as historian Becky Nicolaides put it. But the slowdown in new housing builds across the region, Glaeser and Gyourko found, has been especially pronounced in well-off, low-density suburbs with desirable amenities like good schools. These suburbs have plenty of room to densify and welcome more neighbors — they just aren't doing it. 

“America's suburban frontier,” the authors warn, “appears to be closing.” 

The findings suggest that the fundamentals of housing in Raleigh, Orlando, or Miami are not so different from every other hot real estate market in the country. In most parts of the US with a growing economy and good jobs, the housing market has become badly broken to a degree that transcends the usual explanations, like regional differences in construction licensure rules or environmental review requirements — although those factors, without a doubt, matter. 

So what's really going on? Housing markets are complicated, and economic shocks like the Great Recession and the recent spike in interest rates have surely played a role. But the downturn in housing builds predates both those things, Glaeser and Gyourko found, suggesting a deeper cause. The Sunbelt may be confronting the same obstacle that has paralyzed growth elsewhere. It's one of the most taken-for-granted facts of modern American life: the suburban model itself, and all its attendant political, regulatory, and financial problems. 

Since the end of World War II, housing supply growth in the United States has overwhelmingly been driven by suburban sprawl radiating ever outward from city centers. Instead of building up, with density, we largely built out. But that engine may be running out of steam — and as a strategy for filling our national housing shortage, it's failing spectacularly. 

“It hasn't been working in the supply-constrained coastal markets for four decades. What's new is it looks like it's starting not to work in the Sunbelt,” the country's fastest-growing, most economically dynamic region, Gyourko said. “That changes the nature of America.” 

The strangeness of housing policy in the US can be summed up like this: On a national level, we long for growth. On a local level, we do everything possible to smother it. That contradiction stems, in part, from our dependence on sprawl. 

America is a nation of suburbs — that's certainly not changing any time soon. And there's nothing inherently wrong with suburbs, a housing arrangement as old and varied as human civilization. But to solve the housing crisis that is at the root of so many national problems, Americans will have to fundamentally rethink what the suburb is, and what it could become. 

If you, like me, are too online for your own good, perhaps you've seen some version of this meme. 

That image is a pretty accurate reflection of what American cities used to look like by default. Our suburbs, too, once looked much like this — remnants of the pattern can still be seen in places like Oak Park, Illinois (a suburb of Chicago), University City, Missouri (outside St. Louis), or Brookline, Massachusetts (neighboring Boston). Derived from the Latin word “suburbium,” meaning the area under or near a city, suburbs are so old that if you've ever thought about them, congratulations, you've been thinking about the Roman Empire. 

Of course, what dense, older suburbs like Brookline or Oak Park have in common is that, like the cities they neighbor, they were largely laid out before mass car ownership. It was only relatively recently that suburbs became synonymous with a specific, car- and sprawl-oriented development style. 

If the Western frontier defined American optimism in the 19th century, the suburban frontier defined it in the 20th. It's a story you may already know in broad strokes: Before World War II, only a small share of Americans lived in suburbs, with the bulk living in rural areas and central cities. After the war, a complex alchemy of factors — including a national economic and population boom, federally backed mortgages that favored suburban homes, a Great Depression- and war-era housing shortage, and white flight — produced one of the greatest social and spatial transformations in the country's history.

It would be easy, from our 21st-century perspective, to simply be bewildered by the urban planning decisions that fueled this wave of suburbanization. But those choices make a lot more sense when framed by the daily realities of mid-century urban life. Much of the prewar urban housing stock was genuinely terrible — many people lacked access to a full bathroom or even a flush toilet. Cities were still manufacturing centers and had the pollution to go with it. Americans who could afford to move were understandably pulled toward modern, spacious houses being built on an unprecedented scale in new tracts outside the city.

As this shift took place, the nature of the suburbs changed, from an organic extension of the city to what must have looked, to some at the time, like an alien planet. By 1970, most Americans dwelling in metropolitan areas — meaning a core city and its adjacent areas — were living in suburbs, and by 2010, most Americans were, full stop. Sunbelt cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas, which in the decades after World War II grew from little more than desert towns to megacities, developed in a particularly suburban, car-dependent form. 

For a long time, that model worked well for a lot of people. But there was a problem that slowly made itself felt: Though they were themselves the product of a major transformation, postwar American suburbia relied on a restrictive set of rules that made suburban neighborhoods, once built, very difficult to change. Irrationally rigid regulations on housing remain in place across the country today. If you live in a single-family home, there's a very good chance you're banned from dividing your house into a duplex, redeveloping it into a triplex or apartment building, renting out a floor to a tenant, or opening a corner store. 

These rules are set out by a system known as zoning: local regulations on what kind of things can be built where. Zoning, including single-family-exclusive zoning, first spread across the US in the early 20th century (before that, development was far more freewheeling and improvised). It reached its full expression after World War II, when it became a near-universal toolkit for shaping suburban America. 

At first glance, the idea of zoning seems reasonable enough: Factories that emit toxic pollutants should probably be kept away from residential areas, for example. In practice, it has amounted to an extraordinarily heavy-handed, totalizing form of central planning controlling the fabric of daily life. 

The overwhelming majority of residential land nationwide, as housing advocates are fond of saying, bans the construction of anything other than detached single-family houses — and that's just the beginning. Zoning codes include legions of other rules, often including minimum size requirements (effectively banning starter homes) and mandatory parking spots for at least two cars. Apartments, in many areas, are zoned out of existence.

Suburbs exist all over the world. But the US, despite our national reputation for freedom and individualism, is relatively unique in having such a prescriptive segregation of land uses governing what people are allowed to do with what is, don't forget, their own property, as Sonia Hirt, an architecture and planning professor at the University of Georgia, explains in her book Zoned in the USA. 

We're also unusual in granting privileged status to one specific, costly, and resource-intensive type of housing. “I could find no evidence in other countries that this particular form — the detached single-family home — is routinely, as in the United States, considered to be so incompatible with all other types of urbanization as to warrant a legally defined district all its own, a district where all other major land uses and building types are outlawed,” Hirt writes. 

Suburban-style zoning has become widespread not just in suburbs proper, but also in core cities, many of which have adopted similar zoning codes that would have made their original growth and housing diversity impossible. 

In that sense, suburbia isn't just a specific place — it's a mindset that's become the default American settlement pattern. For mid-century home buyers, the costs of our suburban revolution were distant. But it didn't take long for those costs to become felt nationally. 

By rigidly defining what a community is allowed to look like, suburban zoning has done more than simply shape the physical form of our cities. It has also made it all but impossible for many communities to adapt and grow, as human societies always have, which has created severe distortions in housing markets. 

“The suburban development model is built on the premise of stasis,” as Charles Marohn, a civil engineer and founder of the advocacy group Strong Towns, has put it. “These neighborhoods are frozen at their current number of households, no matter how much the surrounding city transforms. No matter how many jobs are created. No matter how desirable the area is or how high rents get,” he wrote in his recent book Escaping the Housing Trap.

That stasis quickly froze America's most desirable metro areas, leaving them unable to build enough housing to meet demand. And when housing becomes scarce relative to the number of people who want to live in the community, it simply becomes more expensive. 

Starting in the 1970s, home construction plummeted and prices soared in high-opportunity coastal cities because of restrictions on supply. Los Angeles, incredibly, downzoned its residential areas to such an extent between 1960 and 1990 that its total population capacity, as measured by the number of households it's zoned to accommodate, declined from 10 million people to about 4 million, which is the level the city's population has hovered around for the last decade. 

The upshot is that many of America's metropolitan areas have become dominated by what economist Issi Romem identified in 2018 as a “dormant suburban interior.” After World War II, cities and suburbs built out and out, mostly low-density single-family homes, before they largely stopped building altogether because zoning laws forced them to maintain an inflexible suburban form. Despite a few pockets of dense growth, most residential areas have been locked out of building incrementally and thickening up, even as demand to live there increases. 

When a high-demand city refuses to allow greater housing density, the dynamic becomes progressively more toxic, not just because homes become more scarce, but also because market incentives can push developers to replace cheaper, smaller single-family houses with more costly McMansions (as opposed to, in a healthier market, building apartments or a set of townhomes that could house more people in the same amount of space, for less money per household). 

In expensive cities, proposals to build more housing have, famously, often been blocked by angry neighbors (derisively called NIMBYs) who rely on a labyrinthine tangle of zoning laws to foil change that they don't like. Now, that vicious cycle is poised to catch up with the South and Southwest, where, Glaeser and Gyourko believe, the decline in housing starts is likely a function of incumbent residents using regulation to make it harder to build. 

“People in the Sunbelt, now that things have gotten big enough, they've figured out what the Bostonians figured out a long time ago, and the Angelenos,” Gyourko said. (And plenty of anecdotal evidence from local housing fights in the Sunbelt, Slate reporter Henry Grabar has noted, points to the same thing.)

Suburbia offered Americans an implicit bargain: Neighborhoods would never have to change, and we could instead accommodate more people by sprawling outward forever. To a great extent, that's what's happened, and it's given us lots of single-family homes, but also a mind-boggling expanse of costly, deteriorating infrastructure, nightmare commutes, unrestrained greenhouse gas emissions, sedentary, disease-promoting lifestyles, and one of the highest car crash death rates in the developed world. 

And we're still in a housing crisis, because even in the sprawl-hardened, car-loving Southwest, sprawl has its limits. I put this question to Gyourko: Once the most distant, low-density exurbs of, say, Dallas declare themselves full, why don't developers simply keep building the next ring of sprawl 50-plus miles away? “People don't want to live that far,” he said (he later clarified that we don't know the precise outer limit beyond which housing demand dwindles). Human prosperity has always depended on proximity to one another and to opportunity — and even in 2025, it still does. 

The US has gotten steadily more suburban over the last century, but not uniformly so. In the early 2010s, many core cities, including Denver, Atlanta, and Washington, DC, grew faster than suburbs, due to a combination of younger generations' increasing interest in urban lifestyles and a collapse in suburban home construction after the Great Recession. 

Some of the most expensive homes in the country are consistently those located in dense, vibrant prewar cities, a clear signal that there's high demand for those amenities. The revival of cities in the last few decades and the ongoing suburbanization of the US, Gyourko said, have both been happening at the same time. 

Nevertheless, many Americans today, particularly post-Covid, still demonstrate a preference for the suburbs, for all sorts of reasons, including cheaper, larger homes for families of the kind that can be hard to find in cities. Americans are also spending more time alone and at home, and working remotely, which might increase their preference for spacious living quarters and diminish interest in urban life. 

“There's a pendulum that swings between loving the city and loving the suburbs, and it was absolutely shifting towards loving the city” in the 2010s, Romem told me. “And then the pandemic came and undid all of that.” 

The disruptions of Covid also revealed the fragility created by American-style urban planning. Because of our preexisting shortage of about 3.8 million homes, a small share of Americans moving residences upended housing markets across the country. 

Plenty of cities and states, especially since the post-2020 run-up in home prices, have finally begun to take their largely self-inflicted housing shortages seriously. “A bunch of broken policies that seemed unfixable a year ago are actively being fixed,” said M. Nolan Gray of California YIMBY. 

The sheer volume of new laws meant to make it easier to build homes has been overwhelming, reflecting the morass of local obstacles. Here are just a few:

If it sounds draconian for states to interfere in cities' and suburbs' policies, consider that the US is unusual in its hyperlocal control over housing. Although huge barriers remain, we're just beginning to see the contours of a major shift in how housing in America gets regulated and built. 

Skyrocketing housing prices since the pandemic have given new fuel to the YIMBY (or “Yes in my backyard”) movement, which for more than a decade has sought to legalize the full diversity of housing options across the US. At bottom, YIMBYism is about freeing cities and suburbs from “the zoning straitjacket,” as M. Nolan Gray, an urban planner and senior director of legislation and research for the housing advocacy nonprofit California YIMBY, put it. In other words, he said: “Let people do things.”

“A city is the ultimate form of emergent order. A city represents the plans of the millions of people who live there and work there and play there and study there,” he said. “The basic instinct of zoning is that we can sit down and write out the exact appropriate types of uses, scale of those uses, and exactly where those uses can go — and it's just such a presumptuous way to govern a city.” 

The deeper implication is not just that we need more housing, but also that suburbs must be allowed to function like the miniature cities they are. They should be flexible enough to support a range of human aspirations — not just the hallmarks of stereotypical suburban life, but also the amenities of urban life. “No neighborhood can be exempt from change,” as Marohn put it. 

Zoning exclusively for detached single-family homes, for example, has never made much sense, but it especially doesn't make sense in 2025, when most Americans live in household sizes of two or one. Recognizing this, along with the severity of their housing crises, a number of cities and states have gotten rid of single-family-exclusive zoning in the last decade, along with other barriers to building housing. But because zoning codes are enormously complicated, repealing one barrier often isn't enough to actually allow multifamily housing to get built — things like height limits or excessive parking minimums can still make it infeasible. 

“Housing is like a door with a bunch of deadbolts on it,” Alli Thurmond Quinlan, an architect and small-scale developer based in Fayetteville, Arkansas, told me. “You have to unlock all the deadbolts, but as soon as you do, there's an enormous amount of human creativity” that rushes in. She stresses that communities shouldn't be afraid of going too far in repealing zoning rules, and that if anything, they should err on the side of going further. 

Repeal minimum lot sizes, and a developer might find a way to build a cute narrow house in a gap between existing houses. Removing parking requirements made it possible to build this lovely set of densely clustered cottages — a development style that can blend harmoniously into suburban neighborhoods — in Atlanta at a significantly lower cost: 

A single-family house, meanwhile, can be turned into a duplex: 

Right now, what little density is being added to cities and suburbs often comes in the form of large apartment buildings (you may know them as “gentrification buildings”). There's nothing wrong with those, and they have an important role to play in mitigating the housing shortage. Yet many people don't want them built in single-family neighborhoods. Making it legal to incrementally densify single-family neighborhoods would allow suburbs to still look like suburbs, while greatly increasing their population capacity and their ability to support essential services like public transit. 

“The dormant suburban sea is so vast that if the taboo on densification there were broken, even modest gradual redevelopment — tearing down one single-family home at a time and replacing it with a duplex or a small apartment building — could grow the housing stock immensely,” Romem wrote in 2018. 

That style of neighborhood development — gradually over time, rather than building to completion all at once — also happens to be the secret to creating places with a visually appealing vernacular character, Romem said. “True character comes from layer upon layer over a span of many years, from many people's different, disparate decisions. And that requires change.” 

At the dawn of mass suburbanization, Americans had legitimate reasons for wanting to move out of cities, where substandard housing and overcrowding were still commonplace. But “one generation's solutions can become the next generation's problems,” as journalists Ezra Klein (a Vox co-founder) and Derek Thompson wrote in their book Abundance. The same forces that built the American dream 80 years ago are now suffocating it, inflicting profound pain on families across the country. 

For me, this subject is personal: I've lived in apartments literally my entire life, a form of housing often treated as second-class, if it's even permitted to exist. Some of that has been in cities, and some in a suburb. My immigrant mother worked incredibly hard to find homes that were safe, stable, and affordable to raise a child in. America gave me everything, but our national housing reality made things far more difficult for her than they needed to be. 

There's no shortage of wonky policy ideas about how to fix housing in the US — and they go far beyond just zoning codes (you don't want to hear me get started on building codes or impact fees). We will also need a society-wide paradigm shift beyond policy: The financial and real estate industries will need to relearn models for supporting incremental densification, which, experts consistently told me, have fallen by the wayside since the entrenchment of sprawl and restrictive zoning. 

More than that, our minds will have to open up to the inevitability of constant change, and abandon the idea that any of us has a right to veto our community's evolution. As Marohn points out in Escaping the Housing Trap, “a community that has lost all affordable starter housing already has changed irreversibly. It is only the buildings that have not.” 

The suburbs, above all, must be allowed to be plural. Across cultures and centuries, people of all sorts of circumstances have lived on the outskirts of urban life. Today, Americans of every social class seek homes in the suburbs. Some are affluent; many are not. Others want to be near a good school, a job, a support system, or simply a hard-won foothold of affordability. It's not the role of a planning board or a legacy zoning map to decide. We don't know what the future of the suburbs will be — but we can free them to become what we need of them.

Artificial intelligence-oriented cloud infrastructure company CoreWeave said Monday it will acquire Core Scientific, a data center infrastructure provider, in an all-stock deal valued at approximately $9 billion.

CoreWeave stock fell 3% in Monday's trading session, while Core Scientific stock slid nearly 18%. Shares of both companies rallied at the end of June after the Wall Street Journal reported that talks were underway for an acquisition.

""I think that, like many things that we do, it takes the market some time to internalize the value proposition that we are representing to the market and how it all fits together,"" CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator told CNBC in an interview.

In a presentation to investors, CoreWeave said the move will eliminate $10 billion in future lease obligations and significantly enhance operating efficiency.

""We're not paying rent, right, for the next 15 years,"" Intrator said.

The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, pending regulatory and shareholder approval.

The deal expands CoreWeave's access to power and real estate, giving it ownership of 1.3 gigawatts of gross capacity across Core Scientific's U.S. data center footprint, with another gigawatt available for future growth.

Of Core Scientific's 1.3 gigawatts, 840 megawatts are allocated to CoreWeave's contracts at five locations, Nitin Agrawal, CoreWeave's finance chief, said on a call with analysts. After the deal closes, CoreWeave said it will be able to choose to divest Core Scientific's cryptocurrency mining business, which was responsible for 89% of Core Scientific's first-quarter revenue, or make it ready to handle AI workloads.

""We have gone through the conversion process,"" Intrator said. CoreWeave is in the middle of an upgrade with Galaxy Digital, he said. The cost associated with converting cryptocurrency sites is less than it is for setting up new AI data centers, Intrator said.

Plus, CoreWeave will be able to pursue investments from infrastructure-oriented vehicles and other sources that could result in a lower cost of capital, Agrawal said on the investor call. As of March 31, CoreWeave's weighted average rate on its short-term debt was 10.1%.

Core Scientific has increasingly focused on high-performance compute workloads since emerging from bankruptcy and relisting on the Nasdaq in 2024. It employs over 300 people. It has worked with CoreWeave since 2018, Intrator said.

CoreWeave went public in March, and even after Monday's pullback, its shares are worth four times more than they were at it was looking to join the Nasdaq.

When CoreWeave began working on infrastructure for AI, some people said the company should be building its own data centers, but it would have been a difficult pitch to investors, Intrator said.

But now CoreWeave is a public company, with nearly $1 billion in quarterly revenue and a broad investor base. It's constructing its own data centers, separate from Core Scientific, as it competes with major cloud infrastructure sellers such as Amazon Web Services.

""When you look at the hyperscalers, they have some infrastructure that they build, and they have some infrastructure that they use third parties to deliver, and there's a reason that they do that, and those reasons kind of are applicable to us, too, and so that's what you're seeing,"" Intrator said.

Shareholders of Core Scientific will receive 0.1235 CoreWeave shares for each share they hold. That implies a $20.40 per-share valuation and a 66% premium to Core Scientific's closing stock price before deal talks were reported.

After the deal closes, Core Scientific shareholders will own less than 10% of the combined company.

The two companies could have come together earlier. Last year Core Scientific said it had rejected CoreWeave's unsolicited offer to buy all outstanding shares.

CleanSpark (CLSK) reached the 50 EH/s milestone in June, expanding operations across four U.S. states and improving average fleet efficiency to 16.15 joules per terahash (J/Th).

The Las Vegas-based firm produced 685 BTC last month, bringing its year-to-date output to 3,968 BTC. All coins were self-mined, and total bitcoin holdings reached 12,608, ranking the company seventh among publicly traded bitcoin holders, one spot ahead of Tesla.

CleanSpark sold 578.51 BTC for $61.2 million, with an average sale price of $105,860, outpacing the volume-weighted average price for the month.

""June 2025 marked a milestone month for CleanSpark,"" said CEO Zach Bradford. ""We achieved our mid-year target of reaching 50 EH/s... through fully self-operated infrastructure.""

The company secured contracts for an additional 179 megawatts (MW) of power, raising its total contracted capacity to 987 MW. The new capacity is expected to support more than 10 EH/s of incremental hashrate.

CleanSpark also launched its Digital Asset Management program, which includes a spot sales strategy and derivative overlay. The initiative showed initial gains in June, supporting the company's broader focus on optimization and operating leverage.

The iPhone's new glassy look has been toned down with Monday's release of the third developer beta of iOS 26. This follows user complaints that the update made parts of the user interface more difficult to read.

At WWDC 2025 in June, the tech giant introduced its new design language, known as Liquid Glass, which is inspired by the optical qualities of glass in the real world, including how it refracts light and its translucent nature.

But the early version in the first developer beta of iOS 26 and the accompanying updates for Apple's other devices still left room for improvement in terms of usability, accessibility, and legibility. 

Last month, Apple fixed some of the more prominent issues with Liquid Glass, like how it made the Control Center so transparent that the iPhone Home Screen icons and widgets shone through, creating visual clutter and confusion.

Monday's update sees Apple taking yet another step to dial things back from an overly-glassy look in a number of key areas. While beta 2 addressed problems with the Control Center, beta 3 shifts its focus to other areas of the mobile operating system, like Notifications and navigation within Apple's first-party apps, like Apple Music.

For instance, the navigation bar in Apple's streaming music app no longer sees the background shining through a bit, opting for a more solid white. 

Notifications are also less translucent, as the background behind the text is darkened, increasing contrast. 

While the changes arguably make features easier to read, some users now complain that Apple has gone too far in the other direction with a return to more of a “frosted glass” aesthetic.

However, it's worth remembering these are just developer betas — early versions of the mobile operating system that won't be finalized until its public release this fall. The point of beta software is to allow Apple to collect feedback, find bugs, and address issues before the software rolls out more broadly. 

That means Apple could continue to tweak the Liquid Glass look-and-feel over the coming releases to find the sweet spot for the new glassy look within every app and screen. 

Announce a huge redesign just to throw much of it away. Apple should be allowing users to choose how much glass they want instead of just reversing by 75%. At least rename it now to Frosted Glass. Lol. https://t.co/obp9rWe5Ji

iOS 26 beta 3 featuring Diluted Glass

ios 26 beta 3 is a complete cop out, they just rolled back the glass rather than making it work well. frosted glass with dark backgrounds is what it is now.

Es ABSURDO lo que Apple está haciendo con Liquid Glass en iOS 26 beta 3 🤦🏻‍♂️iOS 26 cada vez es mas iOS 18 en cuanto a diseño. No tiene sentido que presuman y anuncien un “nuevo diseño” si al final lo van a dejar 80% igual que iOS 18 🙄Primero el CC y ahora las Barras de… pic.twitter.com/sJx9Q06Rrm

Adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2) plays a critical role in immune regulation, particularly in monocyte differentiation and activation. Unlike ADA1, which primarily functions intracellularly, ADA2 can be secreted or trafficked to lysosomes. Deficiency in ADA2 (DADA2) leads to systemic vasculitis marked by elevated TNF-α levels, excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and impaired differentiation of monocytes into anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. Research demonstrates that intracellular ADA2 localizes within endolysosomes of macrophages, and its reduction correlates with heightened TNF-α secretion. This suggests ADA2 modulates lysosomal adenosine levels, influencing inflammatory pathways. In pneumonia patients, elevated ADA2 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) align with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, while cord blood exhibits low ADA2, fostering an immunosuppressive milieu. Secreted ADA2 binds apoptotic cells, reducing extracellular adenosine and activating immune responses, highlighting its dual intra- and extracellular roles in inflammation.

Monocyte subsets exhibit differential ADA2 expression. CD16⁺ monocytes, key TNF-α producers, show lower intracellular ADA2 compared to classical CD16⁻ subsets. This disparity mirrors findings in DADA2 patients, where ADA2 deficiency leads to unregulated TNF-α release. GM-CSF-differentiated macrophages, associated with pro-inflammatory M1 polarization, express less ADA2 than M-CSF-driven M2 macrophages. CpG oligonucleotides (ODNs) enhance ADA2 retention in lysosomes, potentially stabilizing the enzyme and dampening TNF-α production. Such dynamics underscore ADA2's role in balancing immune activation. Clinical data reveal ADA2 as a biomarker in pneumonia: BAL levels rise during acute phases and decline post-treatment, correlating with cytokine profiles. This positions ADA2 as a prognostic tool for monitoring disease progression and therapeutic efficacy.

Mechanistically, ADA2 regulates lysosomal adenosine, which may influence DNA methylation and gene expression. In DADA2, impaired adenosine clearance in lysosomes disrupts epigenetic regulation, amplifying inflammatory signals. ADA2 also binds apoptotic cells via interactions with DNA and proteoglycans, suggesting a role in resolving inflammation by clearing immunomodulatory adenosine. Experiments with THP-1 cells show adenosine-induced apoptosis, mitigated by ADA2's enzymatic activity. These findings propose ADA2 as a safeguard against cytotoxic adenosine accumulation, linking its intracellular activity to cell survival and immune homeostasis.

The study highlights growth factors like GM-CSF and M-CSF as regulators of ADA2 expression and trafficking. GM-CSF reduces ADA2 levels, promoting M1 polarization and TNF-α secretion, while M-CSF sustains ADA2, favoring anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes. Mutations in ADA2 disrupt protein stability and trafficking, explaining phenotypic variability in DADA2. Enzyme replacement therapy shows limited efficacy, as extracellular ADA2 fails to curb TNF-α in DADA2 monocytes, emphasizing the importance of intracellular ADA2. Targeting lysosomal ADA2 activity emerges as a potential strategy to modulate macrophage polarization and inflammation.

Clinical implications extend beyond DADA2. Elevated ADA2 in tuberculosis and HIV underscores its role in chronic infections, while low cord blood levels align with neonatal immune tolerance. The enzyme's dual function—lysosomal adenosine regulation and extracellular immune activation—positions it as a multifaceted therapeutic target. Future research could explore ADA2's interaction with nucleic acids and its impact on Toll-like receptor signaling, offering insights into autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Overall, ADA2's intracellular and extracellular dynamics reveal a complex interplay between adenosine metabolism, immune cell activation, and disease pathogenesis, paving the way for novel interventions in inflammation and cancer.

Check out some key statistics and facts from the USWNT's 4-0 victory over Ireland. (0:58)

United States women's national team midfielder Lily Yohannes has signed a three-year contract with French powerhouse OL Lyonnes, the club announced on Monday.

Lyonnes, the eight-time champions of Europe, had agreed to terms last week on a transfer with Ajax for the 18-year-old American, sources told ESPN. Her contract will run through June 30, 2028.

A source told ESPN that the fee is around €450k ($526k), with Ajax also receiving a percentage in a future transfer. Yohannes' contract with Ajax ran through June 2026.

English champions Chelsea were also in the running to sign Yohannes, sources previously told ESPN.

Yohannes has eight caps for the USWNT. She scored 10 minutes into her debut in June 2024 as a 17-year-old.

In November, Yohannes declared her decision to represent the United States internationally. She previously had not decided amid interest from the Netherlands, where she was reportedly in the process of securing Dutch citizenship.

Yohannes was born in Virginia and her family moved to the Netherlands when she was 10. She signed a professional contract with Ajax at age 15.

In 2023, when she was 16, Yohannes became the youngest player to ever start a UEFA Women's Champions League match when she started for Ajax in a 2-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain.

""She's got unbelievable maturity and coachability, and someone who I know is going to become an important part of our program,"" USWNT head coach Emma Hayes told reporters in May.

""But I'm invested in that development, and we have to be patient with that considering her tender age and her lack of international and high-level experience.""

There might be even more Argentinian flair on Inter Miami soon. The MLS club has begun talks with Atletico Madrid about a possible transfer deal involving midfielder Rodrigo De Paul, soccer insider Fabrizio Romano reported Monday.

De Paul, 31, is entering the final year of his current contract. If De Paul and Atletico Madrid are unable to agree to an extension in the coming weeks, the Spanish club will seek to move him in a transfer, ESPN reported. But there might be some disagreement within Atletico Madrid about taking that approach as manager Diego Simeone would like the club to keep De Paul for at least another season, ESPN added in its report.

De Paul has been one of the top midfielders in La Liga as of late. After completing his fourth year with Atletico Madrid, De Paul was named to the 2024-25 La Liga Team of the Season. He scored three goals over 53 total matches for his club team this past season and has 14 goals in 187 career caps for Atletico Madrid. 

As for his international career, De Paul has become a key player for Argentina over the last few years as well. He started for Argentina in its 2022 FIFA World Cup final win over France and its 2024 Copa America final win over Colombia. He has two goals in 78 caps for Argentina.

If Inter Miami were able to land De Paul, it would likely need to clear up a Designated Player slot. Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba currently occupy those three spots for Inter Miami, which is the maximum amount of Designated Players a team can have. With Busquets turning 37 in July, his possible retirement would seem to be the most likely option for Inter Miami to open up a Designated Player spot, according to CBS Sports. 

While Busquets might be on the outs, adding De Paul would be another player with ties to Messi to join Inter Miami since his arrival in 2023. Alba and Luis Suarez played with Messi with Barcelona before joining him at Inter Miami, while there are eight other Argentinian players on the MLS club's roster. 

After winning the Supporters' Shield last season in its first full year with Messi, Inter Miami is seeking to go back-to-back and take the next step as a club. Following its disappointing Round 1 exit in the MLS Playoffs last year, Inter Miami is sixth in the Eastern Conference standings, but it only trails first-place FC Cincinnati by 10 points with four games in hand. Inter Miami was also eliminated in the Round of 16 in the FIFA Club World Cup.

After weeks of learning lessons in wins, the U.S. finally learned their harshest one in a Gold Cup final loss to Mexico

HOUSTON - Finally, the wheels came off. After a summer riding a wave of inexperienced youngsters with chips aplenty on their shoulders, the U.S. men's national team finally stumbled. Ultimately, the final was one bridge too far.

It didn't start that way. After an early goal from Chris Richards, the USMNT looked like they had the will to contest their heated rivals. Mexico, though, never wavered, erasing that 1-0 deficit to score a goal in each half to seize the Gold Cup with a 2-1 win on Sunday night.

It will sting for the USMNT, no doubt, especially considering how well they started. Richards' fourth-minute goal sent a jolt of energy through NRG Stadium, even with its pro-Mexico crowd, while energizing a youthful U.S. group throughout the first half. In the 27th minute, though, Mexico wrestled momentum back, with Raul Jimenez smashing a shot past a helpless Matt Freese to equalize following some ugly U.S. defending from a throw-in.

The teams traded chances from there but, make no mistake: from that point on, it was Mexico's game to lose. They didn't. Instead, they simply attacked it, with Edson Alvarez just narrowly beating the offside trap in the 77th minute to win the game and, more importantly, the trophy.

El Tri celebrated in Houston on Sunday night, and rightfully so. It was their 10th Gold Cup trophy, more than any other nation - the U.S. is second with seven, in 13 finals. They were, throughout this tournament and on this night, the best team.

""We're disappointed obviously to not come away with a win,"" U.S. captain Tim Ream said.

Pochettino made it clear postgame: he didn't want to make excuses, but he was upset with the manner in which USMNT lost. The USMNT boss called out the officiating, taking issue with three of the game's defining calls. There was a potential handball on Jorge Sanchez, a questionable onside on Mexico's winning goal and possible foul on Richards leading up to that goal.

None of those calls went the USMNT's way. Suffice it to say Pochettino noticed.

""I am the first to say we need to improve,"" Pochettino said. ""I am not crying. I am not saying anything against Mexico. I respect Mexico, full respect, and I have congratulated them from the beginning. I only say that, if that happened against Mexico, the coach, the people and the players would be talking the same way. For me, there would be a fire in the stadium.""

The inexperienced USMNT spent the summer attempting to defy odds, fighting, scrapping and learning lessons all the way to the final. There was no glory at the end, though, and no trophy as they were finally dealt their toughest lesson yet: that the small moments matter and, ultimately, those moments cost the U.S. a trophy.

Grigor Dimitrov's heartbreaking injury struggles continued on Monday at Wimbledon, where the Bulgarian was forced to retire due to injury when leading top seed Jannik Sinner 6-3, 7-5, 2-2.

The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Sinner suffered a nasty fall in the opening game of their fourth-round clash, and was unable to cope with Dimitrov's varied style across the opening two sets. Yet Dimitrov, who has now retired in each of his past five Grand Slam appearances, pulled up in the third set holding his right pectoral muscle and called the match in tears after two hours.

""Honestly I don't know what to say,” said Sinner. “He is an incredible player, I think we all saw this today. He's been so unlucky in the past couple of years. An incredible player, a good friend of mine also, we understand each other very well off the court too. Seeing him in this position, honestly, if there would be a chance that he could play the next round, he would deserve it.”

Dimitrov served an ace out wide to hold serve for 2-2 in the third set, but then collapsed to the ground in pain holding his right pectoral muscle. Sinner ran around the net to offer a hand before Dimitrov went off court, but he returned just moments later in tears as he was unable to continue.

Dimitrov first showed signs of the injury after missing a low backhand volley at 40/0 in that game, swiping across his body to hit a backhand volley before reaching for his pectoral muscle.

""I hope he has a speedy recovery. It's very unlucky from his side,” added Sinner. “I don't take this as a win at all. This is just a very unfortunate moment to witness for all of us. I think already in the last Grand Slams he has struggled a lot with injuries and seeing him now again having this kind of injury is very, very tough. We all saw this with his reaction, how much he cares about the sport. He's one of the most hardworking players on tour and it's very unfortunate.”

Sinner, who is into the quarter-finals at Wimbledon for the fourth consecutive year, will next face World No. 10 Ben Shelton, whom he leads 5-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. The 22-year-old American earlier rallied past Lorenzo Sonego 3-6, 6-1, 7-6(1), 7-5 to reach the quarter-finals at SW19 for the first time.

Dimitrov's series of injury woes began 12 months ago at Wimbledon, where he slipped and damaged his knee in the first set of his fourth-round clash against Daniil Medvedev. He then retired at the US Open quarter-final with Frances Tiafoe two months later, citing physical issues.

At the Australian Open in January, Dimitrov retired in his opening match due to a groin injury and then was forced to retire from the first round last month at Roland Garros, where he suffered a leg injury that had kept him sidelined until Wimbledon.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","Former U.S. Open champ will have Wimbledon earnings slashed by nearly $100,000","https://www.the-express.com/sport/tennis/176765/emma-raducanu-wimbledon-earnings-taxes","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 17:38:40 GMT","



Emma Raducanu's Wimbledon run ended in the third round at the hands of Aryna Sabalenka, curtailing her earnings despite having already amassed a six-figure sum at SW19. The British starlet, famed for her 2021 U.S. Open victory and causing a stir with an outfit that defied Wimbledon's strict dress code, was eliminated following straight-set losses to Sabalenka. Earlier, Raducanu had outplayed Mimi Xu and Marketa Vondrousova.

Raducanu showcased a tenacious performance against Sabalenka, stretching the first set to a tiebreak, yet ultimately couldn't match the Belarusian's power. For reaching round three, the 22-year-old claims £152,000 (approximately $207,000) in prize money.

Nonetheless, taxes won't allow Raducanu to keep all her winnings. She's up against significant tax deductions, which are poised to cut her Wimbledon prize money by almost half.

Tax specialist Paul Barham from Forvis Mazars broke this down for Express Sport, stating: ""Assuming that Emma is an additional rate taxpayer (due to her high earnings), the tax rate that will apply to the prize money will be 45 percent, resulting in a UK tax liability of £68,400 (around $93,000).

""Assuming Emma is resident in the UK, she is also likely to have Class Four National Insurance to pay at two percent on this income, resulting in a National Insurance liability of £3,040 (around $4,000).



""Therefore, her take-home pay after tax and NIC would be £80,560 (around $109,000).

""These figures represent the liabilities before taking into account any deductible expenses such as travel and accommodation costs and coaching fees. These expenses can be deducted from the taxable amount and will therefore reduce the final tax bill.""

After her defeat to Sabalenka, Raducanu couldn't conceal her disappointment, admitting in her post-match interview that it was tough to focus on the positives.

""I think I'm just very self-critical,"" she said. ""It's hard to see. Of course, I'm very proud of being competitive on the court. I think I would rather that than it being completely one way.

DON'T MISS...

""But, yes, there are positives. Right now, it's so soon after the match. I think it's better for me to kind of feel a bit of the pain right now and then process it better that way.

""I think it's difficult to see that right now, having just come off the court. It's hard to take a loss like that. At the same time, I'm playing Aryna, who is No. 1 in the world, a great champion. I have to be proud of my effort today.""

Meanwhile, Sabalenka is gearing up for a quarterfinal clash with Laura Siegemund after her win against Elise Mertens.

Should Sabalenka secure her first Wimbledon championship, she'll pocket a staggering £3 million ($4 million) prize.

Grigor Dimitrov is forced to retire because of injury, giving Jannik Sinner a spot in the Wimbledon quarterfinals. (1:41)

Jannik Sinner advanced to the Wimbledon quarterfinals despite hurting his right elbow in a fall and dropping the first two sets Monday night, after his opponent, Grigor Dimitrov, had to retire with an injured pectoral muscle.

The No. 1-seeded Sinner hadn't dropped a set in the tournament until falling behind No. 19 Dimitrov 6-3, 7-5. But at 2-all in the third set, Dimitrov stopped playing.

""I don't know what to say. He's an incredible player, I think we all saw this today,"" Sinner said while giving a reluctant on-court interview. ""I don't take this as a win at all.""

It's the fifth consecutive Grand Slam tournament where Dimitrov failed to complete a match, the longest such streak by any man in the Open era. He also retired at the Australian Open in January and the French Open in May, plus last year's Wimbledon and US Open.

On the last point against Sinner, Dimitrov served and immediately clutched his chest with his left hand. He took a few steps and crouched, before sitting on the grass. Sinner walked over to that side of the court to check on him.

""My pec,"" Dimitrov told Sinner.

Dimitrov then went to the sideline, sat in his chair and was checked by a trainer and doctor. As Dimitrov talked with them, Sinner knelt nearby. After a delay of a few minutes, Dimitrov walked toward the locker room with the medical personnel.

Soon, he reemerged and said he couldn't continue.

Two hours earlier, it was Sinner down on the ground and seemingly in trouble. He was hurt in the opening game, when his foot gave out from under him and he slipped and fell behind a baseline, bracing his fall with his right hand while still holding his racket.

During a medical timeout while trailing 3-2 in the second set, Sinner winced as a trainer massaged the elbow. Sinner's coaches, Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi, looked on from their box with concern.

Sinner -- a three-time Grand Slam champion who will play No. 10 Ben Shelton of the United States for a berth in the semifinals -- was given a pill to take and play resumed. He frequently shook his right arm or rubbed his elbow between points.

He entered Monday having lost a total of just 17 games in the tournament, tying the record for the fewest in the Open era by man at Wimbledon through three completed matches.

After the second set, the match was paused so the stadium's retractable roof could be closed because of fading sunlight.

About a half-hour later, the match was over.

Overall it was Dimitrov's 10th career retirement at a major.

""He's been so unlucky in the past,"" said Sinner, who called Dimitrov a good friend. ""Very unfortunate for us to witness.""

Andreeva, naturally, saw her nerves increase once spotting the eight-time champion in plain sight.“I really tried my best not to look over there. I knew as soon I would look there, I would completely lose my focus. So I did, at 4-1,” she told the crowd.“I saw Roger and Mirka. Honestly it means a lot to me that you came and watched my match. It's been one of my dreams to see you in real life.”Added Andreeva, “When I saw both of you, I got really, really nervous. I'm super happy that I managed to keep playing focused.

Lando Norris won his home Grand Prix, while Nico Hulkenberg scored a podium at the 239th time of asking, but who else stood out in an eventful Silverstone weekend?

It was a measure of how highly Nico Hulkenberg is rated among his rivals that they so warmly received his first-ever podium after 15 years of trying with a superb drive at Silverstone. But as the German deftly handled the tricky conditions, others were left floundering. Lawrence Barretto selects his winners and losers from the British Grand Prix.

At the 239th time of asking, Nico Hulkenberg secured a podium his talent has long deserved.

It was all the more remarkable given he started 19th, following his eighth Q1 elimination of the season, as his experience shone through in wet-dry conditions.

Updated: A source close to the series tells IndieWire that the deceased “dad” in Season 1 of “And Just Like That” is Lisa Todd Wexley's stepfather.

Earlier: And just like that, a major continuity error in the HBO Max series of the same name has left fans scratching their heads.

On last week's episode of “And Just Like That” Season 3, titled “Silent Mode” and written by Susan Fales-Hill, moneyed Park Avenue documentary filmmaker Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker) was forced to mourn the unexpected offscreen death of her father (Billy Dee Williams). However, as some “Sex and the City” fans on social media observed, Lisa's father had already died — in Season 1.

The episode “Silent Mode” showed Lisa attending her father's funeral at a local theater — he was a stage actor — but as fans pointed out (see the TikTok below), Lisa told her friend Charlotte Goldenblatt (Kristin Davis) in Season 1 that she had lost her father the previous year. The latest episode “Silent Mode” centers around the shock Lisa experiences from her father suddenly having a stroke. Williams played her father, Lawrence Todd, in the Season 2 episode “ALIVE!” 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






But at that point, Lisa had already said he'd died, too. Back in Season 1 circa Big's (Chris Noth) funeral, Lisa had told Charlotte, “I was exactly the same when my father died last year” with regard to Carrie's (Sarah Jessica Parker) grief. Then, we met the father in the episode “ALIVE!” and now, as of “Silent Mode,” he is dead again.

One of the social media theories is that Lisa has two gay dads, but the Darren Starr-created series, showrun by Michael Patrick King, hasn't exactly established that possibility. Nicole Ari Parker's character is one of the Samantha Jones stand-ins the series employed in Season 1 when Kim Cattrall declined to reprise her iconic role. Also among them is real estate agent Seema (Sarita Choudhury). 

Series continuity errors aren't uncommon even in “And Just Like That” as, per People, other users pointed out that Harry Goldenblatt's (Evan Handler) mother died 10 years before the start of Season 2. That doesn't make sense with the timeline of the story as Harry told Charlotte back in “Sex and the City” days that his mother's dying wish was that he marry a Jewish woman.

IndieWire has reached out to HBO Max representatives for comment.
