                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What new methods can be developed in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI)? This is what a recent white paper submitted to the 2025 NASA Decadal Astrobiology Research and Exploration Strategy (DARES) Request for Information (RFI) hopes to address, as a pair of researchers from the Breakthrough Listen project and Michigan State University, discussed how high-energy astronomy could be used for identifying radio signals from an extraterrestrial technological civilization, also called technosignatures. This study has the potential to help SETI and other organizations develop novel techniques for finding intelligent life beyond Earth. For the white paper, the researchers evaluated why high-energy astronomy, which involves celestial objects emitting cosmic rays, gamma rays, and X-rays, could be used by SETI for identifying technosignatures, noting how its use has grown in recent years. Additionally, they discussed the potential sources of high-energy emissions, including neutrinos, X-rays, cosmic rays, gamma rays, pulsar wind nebulae, neutron stars, black holes, solar flares, and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Regarding how this contributes to specifically identifying technosignatures, the researchers note how high-energy signals could be indicative of a form of communication, industry, and habitat. For communication, high-energy signals could be indicative of a technosignature since high-energy signals are often needed to send large amounts of data. For industry, high-energy signals could be indicative of specific activities, including rockets, reactors, nuclear energy, accelerators, or even Dyson spheres and star engines, with the last two being far beyond Earth's technological capabilities. For habitat, high-energy signals could be indicative of life on the surface of neutron stars that survive from nuclear energy and the radiation that neutron stars emit. Finally, the researchers discussed next steps for integrating high-energy astronomy into SETI, including using machine learning, searching X-ray images, neutrino bursts, and gamma-ray observations. Dedicated programs will only be feasible after much further investigation. At this stage, our efforts will be like those of the early radio and optical SETI pioneers who developed methods and infrastructure that took decades to grow into the robust subfield it is today. While no definitive signals have been identified, arguably the closest humanity has come to receiving a signal from another world that occurred seven years before the SETI Institute was founded. Signal, which was a radio signal that lasted over one minute and was received by the Big Ear radio telescope at Ohio State University. Despite repeated attempts, the astronomers at Big Ear were unable to identify the same signal again, and a signal of this strength and length has yet to be identified since then. As the search for technosignatures continues, this white paper demonstrates how SETI could enhance and adapt its techniques for identifying intelligent life beyond Earth, specifically using methods that perhaps once seemed unnecessary or unreliable. Since traditional techniques of searching for radio signals on specific frequencies have shown zero results, perhaps high-energy astronomy could open the door to help astronomers better understand the universe aside from searching for technosignatures.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Created by Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi, the mockumentary brought something fresh to an otherwise stagnant subgenre, and is today regarded as one of the best horror comedies ever made. The spin-off series of the same name that hit FX in 2019 enjoyed similar, if not greater success, but in between the two, there was another short-lived spin-off you may have either missed, or forgotten about completely: Wellington Paranormal. Starring Mike Minogue and Karen O'Leary as Officers Minogue and O'Leary from the feature film, Wellington Paranormal traces a group of New Zealand police investigators who track supernatural events, including cases of demon possession, haunted houses, and blood bank robberies. Lasting for four seasons and a Christmas special, the series maintains the mockumentary format as it introduces viewers to a new crop of hilarious threats, and while it's been available to stream on Hulu for a while, fans can also check it out now on its new streaming home of HBO Max. Also starring Maaka Pohatu and Tom Sainsbury, Wellington Paranormal featured Clement lending his voice to Mobot, and Rhys Darby reprising his character of Anton from What We Do in the Shadows. Though it only lasted for 25 episodes, it clearly left its mark on the horror comedy subgenre, as is evident by its 98% Rotten Tomatoes score. Critic Valerie Ettenhofer from Film School Rejects called it a "drolly-funny cross-genre series with all the trappings of a cult classic," and it's indeed become just that. Daniel Kurland from Bloody Disgusting was another who had high praise for the series, writing: Also called "refreshingly silly and never pretentious" by critic Brian Tallerico from RogerEbert.com, Wellington Paranormal is best summed up as a blend of The Office and The X-Files, but it's so much more. While it's choked full of laughs and absurdity, underneath are themes of xenophobia, bureaucratic maladroitness, and the banality of the inexplicable, all which work to create a series that's as funny as it is thought-provoking. Trust us, the episodes may be short, but when examined under a microscope, you'll quickly realize that Clement and Waititi have a lot to say. All four seasons of Wellington Paranormal, including the Christmas special, are now available to stream on HBO Max. Wellington Paranormal is a comedy series that follows Officers Minogue and O'Leary of the Wellington Police as they investigate supernatural occurrences in their city. The show blends elements of crime procedural and paranormal with a humorous undertone, featuring characters who handle unusual phenomena with a deadpan approach. Set in New Zealand, it showcases quirky scenarios while maintaining a lighthearted narrative throughout the episodes. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Episode 2 is our favorite so far thanks to that epic sauna scene.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>University of Leicester scientists have passed a key European Space Agency review, and now will proceed to design the Qualification Model of a Double-Walled Isolator that could handle and curate samples from a Mars Sample Return mission. It is vital to avoid cross-contamination to properly study the precious samples and so the DWI will be designed to drastically reduce interactions with human beings by using state of the art robotics. Initially developed in the framework of Mars Sample Return (MSR), this project also builds on previous work that the Leicester team has undertaken in designing a prototype Double Walled Isolator. Andrew Cheney, DWI QM Project Manager at Space Park Leicester, said: “The SRR is a major milestone for the project that shows that we've fully understood the customer need, and translated that into a set of requirements to proceed with confidence into the design phase. Now we have that agreed baseline, we look forward to the design phase and the many, many challenges it will bring for this unique piece of equipment. The dedicated qualification phase will involve simulating end-to-end curatorial and scientific processing of martian analogue samples at SPL.” John Holt, DWI QM Principal Investigator at Space Park Leicester, said: “Whether or not an astronaut or a robotic spacecraft brings samples back from Mars, the Double Walled Isolator (DWI) is a key UK technology that enables planetary scientists to scrutinise returned rocks to understand the martian environment and if there is microscopic evidence for life on the red planet. The milestone review [SRR] we have just conducted carefully looked at the complex needs of scientists to ensure we design an ultra-clean system that allows them to handle the precious samples and use a wide range of analytical techniques to unlock the secrets within each piece of rock. Out of this world projects are only possible with the right team and that is what we have here at Space Park Leicester, with our industry partner, Extract Technology, and scientific collaborators at the Open University, the Francis Crick Institute, Imperial College London and the Natural History Museum.” Darren Hughes, Managing Director of Extract Technology Ltd, said: “I am delighted that DEC Group Extract Technology have been chosen as the partner of choice for Space Park Leicester in the design, development and manufacture of the DWI. “Working in collaboration with world leading academics and scientific experts, as well as leveraging our decades of experience and knowledge in providing true end to end solutions in environments that require levels of extremely high containment. “We are as equally proud that the final design will be built at our UK facility in Huddersfield, a testament to the skills and expertise within our business to enable us to deliver on such a prestigious project.” Explorers Club Fellow, ex-NASA Space Station Payload manager/space biologist, Away Teams, Journalist, Lapsed climber, Synaesthete, Na'Vi-Jedi-Freman-Buddhist-mix, ASL, Devon Island and Everest Base Camp veteran, (he/him) 🖖🏻</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's a feud going down over at Prime Video in the U.S. right now where two of the platform's newest titles are going head-to-head in a knock-down-drag-out fight that sees them duking it out for the top spot. Okay, so we might be making it sound much more dramatic than it is, but after a global streak that saw it fall from the number one position on Prime Video's Top 10, Countdown is slowly but surely making a comeback, starting in the United States where it's managed to fight off We Were Liars and reign supreme — if only for now. The former is a high-octane law enforcement-centered production that stars Supernatural and The Boys alum, Jensen Ackles, and Grey's Anatomy legend, Eric Dane. Meanwhile, We Were Liars is about as teen drama heavy as it gets, featuring the talents of Emily Alyn Lind (Doctor Sleep) as a young woman who grows up in extreme wealth, only to have her world flipped upside down by a traumatizing accident that causes her to lose her memory. Despite their massive and distinct differences, it seems there's plenty of space for both Countdown and We Were Liars, with audiences proving to be just as hungry for an action-packed thrill ride as they are for a whodunnit-style mystery with flavors of hits of yesteryear like Gossip Girl. While viewers might be in agreement when it comes to their love for both Countdown and We Were Liars, critics are a completely different story. On Rotten Tomatoes, critics blasted Ackles' big turn as an action star, slamming it with a 36% approval rating against the audience's 72%. At Collider, Jeff Ewing fell in line with the latter group, rating it 8/10 and writing, “As a whole, Countdown's cast and character dynamics make for an engaging watch. The narrative also provides unexpected legs of the investigation that are often well-mined for a drama that stands out in a saturated subgenre. Both Countdown and We Were Liars are now streaming on Prime Video. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Anime owes a huge debt to these historic episodes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Titan could harbor life in its hidden underground ocean, though the entire biosphere might be no more substantial than a miniature poodle. This new revelation, based on research into the moon's potential for microbial life, contrasts with the once-hopeful expectations of abundant alien life on Titan. The study uses bioenergetic modeling to analyze the potential for life in Titan's subsurface ocean, offering a more realistic view of what life might look like in this distant world. Titan's environment is unique in our Solar System, with a thick atmosphere rich in organic molecules, methane lakes, and a subterranean ocean that could harbor microbial life. However, this hypothetical biosphere is minuscule, limited by Titan's energy sources, which are insufficient for a thriving ecosystem. Life on Titan may consist of individual cells struggling for survival in an ocean that is vast but energy-poor. Titan is a cold, mysterious world, distinguished by its thick, hazy atmosphere and unique organic compounds. The surface of Titan is covered in vast liquid methane lakes and rivers, while its subsurface is home to an ocean of water beneath an icy crust. This ocean is of particular interest to scientists, as it might contain the necessary conditions to support life, albeit in a form very different from what we are familiar with on Earth. However, even the simplest life forms, such as fermenting microbes, could find a niche in this cold world. On Earth, fermentation is one of the oldest and simplest methods by which microorganisms generate energy, and it might be the key to survival for any life forms on Titan. Researchers propose that Titan's microbes might use fermentation to break down organic compounds like glycine, a molecule commonly found throughout the Universe. This process does not require oxygen and can provide the necessary energy for microbial life to thrive in an otherwise inhospitable environment. Fermentation could be particularly suitable for Titan's conditions, where the available energy sources are meager, and oxygen is entirely absent. The discovery of microbial life based on fermentation would be an important step forward in understanding how life can adapt to extreme environments in our Solar System. This suggests that any life on Titan would be sparse, with far fewer cells per kilogram of water compared to Earth's oceans. The implications of this finding are significant, as it suggests that life on Titan, if it exists, is not only rare but also incredibly challenging to detect. With fewer than one microbial cell per kilogram of water, finding signs of life in Titan's ocean would be like searching for a needle in a haystack—an enormous haystack located 800 million miles away. These missions will help scientists further understand whether life, albeit microscopic and sparse, could exist on Titan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SINGAPORE, July 7 — A former massage therapist who claimed to possess supernatural powers and taught followers controversial beliefs — including justifying gambling and spiritual marriages — has been sentenced to four months' jail in Singapore for promoting a doctrine deemed contrary to Islamic law. Delivering the sentence, District Judge Shaiffudin Saruwan said Razif's teachings were “linked to sins in Islam” and showed a “high degree of premeditation”. During the trial, Razif was found to have conducted lessons in the early 2000s in which he claimed, among other things, that gambling profits from 4-D and Toto could be “cleansed” and used to fund businesses. According to The Straits Times, Razif had never been accredited under Singapore's Asatizah Recognition Scheme. The Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) states that gambling is clearly prohibited under Islamic law and that spiritual marriages — which lack solemnisation, witnesses, and dowry — are considered deviant. “In most cases, there are no limitations on the number of women ‘married' to a man through such deviant spiritual marriages,” Muis said. One witness, under a gag order, testified that Razif would appear “possessed” during teachings. When speaking as “Mbah”, Razif reportedly adopted an Indonesian accent. She later sought a divorce and gained full custody of their daughter. He said other men also experienced similar breakdowns after their partners followed Razif. Razif denied all allegations when he took the stand in November 2024. Deputy Public Prosecutor Sruthi Boppana sought a sentence of five to seven months, arguing that Razif's conduct had disrupted family ties and was “motivated by self-interest”. Razif still faces a separate charge for allegedly running an unregistered religious school between 2017 and 2020 at Lina's Cafe in Jalan Pisang.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You can see it,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in late May. The medical examiner's conclusions were contested by Epstein's surviving family, who turned to a forensic pathologist who determined that a homicide was far more probable based on the evidence. No one else involved in the Epstein case will face charges, according to the memo, beyond his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving 20 years for child sex trafficking and other related crimes. President Trump previously promised to release the apparently debunked “client list” during his re-election campaign. Trump has asserted that he had never visited Epstein's notorious private island, where scores of underage girls and young women were allegedly abused. But the president has said “a lot of people did” — whom he was willing to unmask. Back in February, Trump's DOJ released Epstein's contact list as part of a long-awaited trove of documents connected to the notorious sex predator. Andrew Cuomo, Alec Baldwin and Mick Jagger were among the high-profile names on Epstein's contact list. But the hyped-up February release was panned by critics as containing little to no new information about Epstein's case. Epstein's demise just 36 days into his stay at the Metropolitan Correctional Center has been the source of rampant conspiracy theories for nearly a decade, including rumors that some of the rich and famous on whom he had incriminating information arranged for him to be murdered. Epstein served just 13 months of an 18-month sentence in a county jail, when he only spent one day a week physically at the facility and the other six out on “work release.” In 2014, Virginia Giuffre alleged in a sworn affidavit that she was sex-trafficked and even used as a “sex slave” for years by Epstein and Maxwell for their own use and for others', including Prince Andrew, which the former royal continues to deny today. Giuffre's bombshell accusation opened the floodgates for other victims to speak out.</p>
