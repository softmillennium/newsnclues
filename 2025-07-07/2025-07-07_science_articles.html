                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Texas Flood Forecasts Were Accurate but Not Sufficient to Save Lives Widespread damage is visible in and around Kerrville, Texas, on July 6, 2025, following a deadly flash flood that caused the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in less than an hour. Now more than 80 people are dead, with dozens more missing across the region as of Monday morning, including at least 10 campers and a counselor from Camp Mystic summer camp on the banks of the flooded Guadalupe River.

Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly, the county's top elected official, said at a press conference on Friday that “we didn't know this kind of flood was coming.” Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd suggested at a separate press conference that NWS forecasts fell short in advance of the floods. Meteorologists can see extreme thunderstorms coming days ahead, but it's notoriously hard to pinpoint the exact amount of rain they'll produce, or how long they will linger in place, so far in advance. Meteorologists have to update their forecasts as better information becomes available. In the case of last week's floods, NWS began to escalate its warnings as much as 12 hours in advance, issuing flood watches beginning Thursday afternoon and upgrading to a flash flood warning by 1a.m. local time Friday, with more urgent warnings following into the early morning. “There have been claims that NOAA/NWS did not foresee catastrophic TX floods — but that's simply not true,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA in a lengthy Bluesky thread defending the NWS weather forecasts. Still, Swain added that “even quite good weather forecasts do not automatically translate into life-saving predictions — there's a lot of other work that has to take place to contextualize the forecast and ensure it gets to [the] right people.” These roles often serve as liaisons between NWS meteorologists and local authorities or emergency managers. Warning coordination meteorologists, in particular, help translate forecasts into usable action plans that can aid the local authorities who make decisions and evacuate communities as severe weather systems approach. It's unclear whether those vacancies have affected coordination with local authorities. Top meteorologists at NWS San Angelo and NWS Austin/San Antonio did not immediately respond to questions about whether the openings posed any challenges during the floods. The offices called “all hands on deck” to ensure that they were fully staffed during the emergency, he said, adding that “they knew this was a critical life and death situation — bodies and lives were on the line in this one.” NOAA spokesperson Erica Grow Cei provided a timeline of NWS warnings between Thursday and Friday, confirming that the first flood watch went out at 1:18 p.m. local time Thursday and the first flash flood warning was issued at 11:41 p.m. for Bandera County. Another flash flood warning — tagged “considerable” to indicate a threat of major damage — was issued at 1:14 a.m. for Bandera and Kerr counties, triggering wireless emergency alerts on enabled devices and warnings on NOAA Weather Radio. “National Weather Service is heartbroken by the tragic loss of life in Kerr County,” Cei said in an emailed statement, adding that the agency "remains committed to our mission to serve the American public through our forecasts and decision support services.” Still, cellphone and radio alerts aren't always enough to prevent loss of life during disasters. Late-night and early-morning warnings can be an even greater challenge to distribute, when much of the public is asleep. Most people who died in Friday's floods were located in Kerr County, which does not have a warning system, according to Kelly, the Kerry County judge, at a Friday news conference. Other cities in central Texas, like San Marcos, deploy outdoor weather sirens to warn of extreme weather events like floods and tornadoes, as local news reports have pointed out. In an interview with The New York Times, Kelly suggested that warning systems are expensive and “taxpayers won't pay for it.” A policy on the camp's website suggests that campers are not permitted to have cellphones, smart watches, iPads or other devices with touchscreens. It's unclear whether counselors had access to devices equipped with emergency alerts or whether the camp had access to a NOAA weather radio. Friday's floods have reignited concerns among scientists and disaster specialists about the impacts of the Trump administration's cuts to federal agencies tasked with responding to extreme weather events. Hurricane season began last month amid widespread chaos at NOAA and FEMA. Experts have warned that smaller disasters, like extreme thunderstorms and floods, are also likely to strain the federal government's disaster response systems this summer. The Trump administration also recently cut funding meant to help NWS warning coordination meteorologists travel for meetings and tabletop exercises with local authorities, Fahy said. These meetings, he said, help NWS staff members and emergency managers plan together for extreme events. “We can't predict where the next severe storm or high-impact weather event will take place,” Fahy said. President Donald Trump has on multiple occasions vowed to overhaul the agency in ways that may make states responsible for more of the costs associated with extreme weather events. Trump, however, approved disaster aid Sunday for Kerr County, which will aid in recovery efforts and help county residents pay for emergency lodging, home repairs and supplies. It was the president's first disaster declaration since June 19, when he approved aid for parts of Tennessee that were damaged by tornadoes in April. Greg Abbott (R) said his administration will seek to work with FEMA to assess the overall damage and determine whether additional counties should be eligible for FEMA aid. When asked by reporters Sunday whether he is still planning to phase out FEMA, Trump deflected. "Well, FEMA is something we can talk about later, but right now, they're busy working,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As if one ancient circular enclosure wasn't enough to evoke intrigue at an archaeological find in Eastern France, three interconnected enclosures raised the bar. In what the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (Inrap) is calling an “unprecedented” discovery in Marliens, France, near Dijon, excavations revealed a series of occupations on one site spanning from the Neolithic period to the First Iron Age. The oldest occupation features a monument with three interlocking enclosures. The team believes all three structures are linked together in both positioning and dating and that a gravel layer found on the two side enclosures suggests a fence was also present. “This type of monument seems unprecedented and currently no comparison has been possible,” the research team says in a statement. A bundle of artifacts—including seven flint arrowheads, two archer's bracers, a flint lighter, and a copper alloy dagger—discovered in the site's ditches correspond to cut flints, suggesting attribution to the Neolithic period, potentially as far back as 10,000 BC to 2,200 BC. Radiocarbon analytics is planned to help determine exact dating. The team located an armband with traces of iron oxide tied to pyrite, indicating it could have been used to light fires. These objects often accompany a burial, but the team couldn't make that conclusion just yet in this case. In another location on the site, the team dates five circular enclosures—four open and one closed across a 64,000 square foot plain—between 1500 BC and 1300 BC. Dating based on five copper alloy pins, a necklace with 40 amber beads, and rare ceramic shards confirms the timing. A First Iron Age occupation is also nearby, about 1,300 feet from the plain, this with urns and burial ornaments. Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

We might finally be able to understand the scale and scope of one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that had been lost to time for centuries. “The objective is to create a digital twin of the Lighthouse of Alexandria, a virtual model offering the unique possibility of ‘visiting' it as if time had never passed,” La Brujula Verde notes, which will allow researchers to “test every possible hypothesis” about both how the tower was built, and how it ultimately fell apart. More than a century later, in 1480, what pieces remained of the lighthouse were used to build the Citadel of Quitbay, which still stands in that spot today. More than just an architectural marvel, the Lighthouse of Alexandria boasted a powerful guiding light for those approaching Egypt by sea. This was a fact recognized by no less than Julius Caesar, who in his Civil Wars wrote that: As La Brujula Verde notes, the “PHAROS” project hopes its reconstruction can elucidate much of what is still very muddled, including “its unique design, its innovative engineering, and, crucially, on the reasons that led to its final collapse after more than sixteen hundred years of defying time and the elements.” But should the “PHAROS” project succeed, it will offer historians of the future to experience this Wonder of the World in a way those ancient writers centuries ago could never have imagined.

Biophysicist Seham Ebrahim of the University of Virginia and her team of researchers were observing mammalian cells when they discovered hemifusomes, which previously eluded detection because they are even smaller than mitochondria and can easily blur or be mistaken for background noise. These nano-orbs, which look like they have, noses bear an uncanny resemblance to BB-8 or the profiles of certain Muppets. Pop culture references aside, their function of organizing, cleaning up, and recycling proteins could potentially unlock new treatments for genetic and neurodegenerative diseases. Hemifusomes consist of two vesicles, which are membrane sacs filled with liquid and formed by hemifusion, meaning that the smaller of the two is fused to the larger one like a hemisphere, almost as if its other half is missing. This occurs when the outer layers of two membranes merge first while the inner membrane layers stay open until a thin connection between them forms a new vesicle. This is probably how they take out cellular trash. Ebrahim used cryo-electron tomography, or cryo-ET, to observe and image hemifusomes. Superfast cameras then took multiple photos of the frozen cells and their organelles. “Our observation of hemifusomes in four different cell lines originating from various species and tissues and frozen as close as possible to their native state suggests that they may be common components of the cell periphery in a wide range of cells and tissues,” she said in a study recently published in Nature Communications. These molecules are then taken in by the cell, whose plasma membrane pinches off to create an endosome that carries them into the cytoplasm. Ebrahim traced the activity of endosomes and hemifusomes, but they did not appear to work together. What makes hemifusomes so important is how they collect and recycle junk proteins. Many studies have shown that the buildup of protein plaque in the brain can cause and aggravate neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer's, and more understanding about how these organelles operate could lead to the development of treatments that work with them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just over 200 years after French engineer and physicist Sadi Carnot formulated the second law of thermodynamics, an international team of researchers has unveiled an analogous law for the quantum world. This second law of entanglement manipulation proves that, just like heat or energy in an idealized thermodynamics regime, entanglement can be reversibly manipulated, a statement which until now had been heavily contested. The new research - released on July 2, 2025 in Physical Review Letters - deepens understanding of entanglement's basic properties and provides critical fundamental insight into how to efficiently manipulate entanglement and other quantum phenomena in practice. Entanglement is arguably the central feature of quantum mechanics. If two microscopic particles are said to be entangled, then if someone measures a quantum property of one of the particles and then repeats the measurement on its entangled partner, they will always find that the pair is correlated, even when the two particles are separated by vast distances. Though entanglement still appears counterintuitive to our lived experience of the world, researchers have discovered striking parallels with something much more familiar: thermodynamics. In fact, many similarities have emerged between the theories of quantum entanglement and thermodynamics. However, an equivalent to the second law of thermodynamics - which dictates that processes tend towards increasing disorder (the aforementioned entropy) and that perfect reversibility is an attainable though rare and highly efficient ideal - has remained stubbornly out of reach. "Finding a second law analogous to the second law of thermodynamics has been an open problem in quantum information science," says study co-author Tulja Varun Kondra. Much work towards addressing this problem has focused on a scenario in which two distant parties (often called Alice and Bob) want to exchange quantum information, but are restricted to act locally on their quantum systems and communicate classically, by say phone or the internet. This limitation to local operations and classical communication (LOCC) simplifies the situation, meaning whatever Alice and Bob do, they cannot affect the intrinsically nonlocal properties of entanglement between their quantum systems. "So the question is, can we somehow go beyond LOCC in a meaningful way, and recover reversibility?" Just as an ordinary battery stores energy which can be used to inject or store work in the context of thermodynamics, an entanglement battery injects and stores entanglement. And just as a regular battery allows tasks to be performed that would be impossible without one, so too does an entanglement battery. By assisting standard LOCC operations with their hypothetical entanglement battery, the team demonstrated that any mixed-state entanglement transformation can be made perfectly reversible. But a more important outcome of this work is that the researchers have shown that the methods they have developed are applicable beyond mixed-state entanglement transformation, allowing them to leverage the entanglement battery to verify reversibility in various scenarios. Proving that entanglement manipulations across all quantum states are reversible is expected to lead to a family of second laws for entanglement manipulation. For example, the same principles apply to systems involving more than two entangled particles, paving the way for understanding and manipulating complex quantum networks and perhaps developing future, highly efficient quantum technologies. "We can have a battery that is supposed to preserve coherence or free energy, and then we can formulate a reversible framework in this setting where, instead of entanglement, we reversibly manipulate that particular resource of our system," says Streltsov. "Though many of these other principles of reversibility have already been confirmed via other approaches, our technique offers a unified proof framework based on well-established physical principles."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The vibration contains a signal that we can decode as music. Now imagine a drumhead that is ultra-thin, about 10 mm wide, and perforated with many triangular holes. Researchers at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, in collaboration with the University of Konstanz and ETH Zurich, have managed to get vibrations to travel around this membrane, almost without any loss. In fact, so little loss that it is far better than even electronic circuit signal handling. Phonons - Sound Signals or Vibrations That Spread Through a Solid Material The signal consists of phonons - which can be translated to what one might call vibrations in a solid material. It is not far-fetched to imagine encoding a signal, which is then sent through the material, and here signal loss comes into play. If the signal loses strength or parts of the signal are lost in heat or incorrect vibrations, one ends up not being able to decode it correctly. The membrane as a platform for sending information is incredibly reliable. Researchers at the Niels Bohr Institute, Assistant Professor Xiang Xi and Professor Albert Schliesser, explain that the result should not be thought of in a specific, future application - but there are still rich possibilities. Currently, there is a global effort to build a quantum computer, which is dependent on super-precise transfer of signals between its different parts. Another field within quantum research deals with sensors that, for example, can measure the smallest biological fluctuations in our own body - here too, signal transfer is crucial. But Xiang Xi and Albert Schliesser are currently most interested in exploring the possibilities even further. For example, we want to build more complex structures and see how we can get phonons to move around them, or build structures where we get phonons to collide like cars at an intersection.

Catherina Becker (centre) says it's key for leaders to give their teams breathing space when ‘something momentous' happens in the world.Credit: Anja Bretschneider In June 2016, neurobiologist Catherina Becker witnessed at first hand how a contentious national issue could affect the members of her laboratory group. But she also had to acknowledge the issue in her group. #OpenToWork: how laid-off US scientists are coping with shattered careers #OpenToWork: how laid-off US scientists are coping with shattered careers Ideally, research labs should be devoid of pressures from national politics or international conflict: places where students, researchers and technicians keep experiments running and discoveries flowing. Distressing events, however, can affect lab members more than a principal investigator (PI) might realize. Becker, who is now at the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, says it's important to allow lab members to express their feelings. In Edinburgh, she established that culture through a Friday lab lunch. It included rollicking 45-minute discussions on topics such as ‘Who's eaten the most experimental animals?' Becker is one of several PIs around the world who spoke to Nature's Careers team about strategies for creating safe spaces to discuss world events. Some of these PIs have been recognized by Nature for outstanding mentorship through its annual award for mentoring in science (see go.nature.com/4zrmakc), now in its 20th year. Although their experiences might be specific to their location, a common theme emerged: that early-career researchers might feel concern and stress, and might need space and time to express their concerns safely in research environments that, historically, have not always prized personal openness or asking for help. These PIs stress that maintaining trust is crucial so that, instead of ignoring the outside world, lab members feel they can speak up when struggling with troubling events. Remember that the words a group leader says — or doesn't say — will affect lab members. Even if a contentious issue does not affect you personally, it could land very differently with lab members who have less power or experience. Catherina Becker, a neurobiologist at the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, suggests taking a lab member whom you suspect might be struggling out for an off-campus coffee or tea. Adesola Ogunniyi, a neurologist at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria, reassures his lab members that their research will not be hindered by outside events. “I tell them to come and see me so we can discuss it,” Ogunniyi says. Exemplify resilience by investing in your own mental health and speaking openly about it to colleagues. This helps to build an atmosphere of trust and respect so that everyone, from undergraduates to staff scientists, knows that they are valued. Sparked by government action that more than doubled the price of fuel, Occupy Nigeria led to nationwide protests including sit-down strikes, demonstrations and even attempts to disrupt the electricity grid. Now an emeritus professor, Ogunniyi, a winner of Nature's 2024 Mentoring in Science award, remembers how he guided his trainees when Occupy Nigeria, and similar protests and labour strikes since then, led to great uncertainty in the academic community. “We had a lot of these incidents in which education was disrupted,” Ogunniyi says. “Such challenges can disturb people, both psychologically and in terms of productivity,” he observes. Ogunniyi told his group members to keep focused on their work, whether by planning its next phase or by looking at past results to identify aspects that needed improvement or required more experiments. That way, he says, “by the time things return back to normal, they are able to come back, make up for these deficits, and continue”. By giving group members ownership of decision-making, he helps them to develop the leadership skills they will need to flourish in their scientific careers. “It has to be a two-way affair,” Ogunniyi says of the partnership. “We must always look for opportunities for growth, so that if one door closes, another one will open” if we are paying attention, he says. “Political situations and socio-economic problems should not stop science.” Andrew Prentice, a maternal and child nutrition researcher and another 2024 award winner, is mentoring his way through a more current international challenge. Prentice directs a group at the Keneba field station, a research and health-care clinic of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine's Medical Research Council Unit in Gambia. Perhaps surprisingly, these affect his funding for research in Gambia because the UK government is reallocating resources to places where US funding has been curtailed. While keeping a positive outlook, Prentice is being pragmatic and is encouraging the members of his group to make contingency plans for their careers. Mentoring in science award winner Andrew Prentice.Credit: MRC Unit The Gambia “Our moral responsibility is to say, yes, I think you do need to look for other options” in case funding does not come through. Prentice says his leadership approach was influenced by the relationship he had with his own mentor in Gambia, Roger Whitehead, a nutritionist who was based there between 1973 and 1998. Five years on: how Brexit changed three scientists' careers Five years on: how Brexit changed three scientists' careers Earlier this year, a PhD student in Prentice's group was unable to travel to Europe for his thesis defence when his family members' visa applications were refused — an unusual occurrence, which Prentice says was probably the result of new political pressures on immigration to European countries. #OpenToWork: how laid-off US scientists are coping with shattered careers Five years on: how Brexit changed three scientists' careers Andrew Prentice: “Mentoring is about growing alongside your students” Academic language has become a proxy for European culture wars Academic language has become a proxy for European culture wars AI ‘scientists' joined these research teams: here's what happened Pioneer the development of insect-based biorobots—join SWARM Biotactics as an Insect Neuroscientist. #OpenToWork: how laid-off US scientists are coping with shattered careers Five years on: how Brexit changed three scientists' careers An essential round-up of science news, opinion and analysis, delivered to your inbox every weekday.

Nature Communications volume 16, Article number: 6124 (2025) Cite this article The 18-electron rule is a fundamental rule in coordination chemistry on which several revolutionary discoveries in catalysis and materials science are founded. This rule has classes of exceptions; however, it is widely taught and accepted that diamagnetic 18-electron complexes do not coordinate to a ligand to form a 20-electron complex even as a reaction intermediate. Here, based on tunable ligand design, we report the formation of 20-electron ferrocene derivatives through reversible nitrogen coordination to 18-electron analogs. Through theoretical studies, we have elucidated key features that enabled this coordination chemistry and how the nitrogen coordination shifts the metal−ligand bonding characters. These 20-electron ferrocene derivatives exhibit reversible FeII/FeIII/FeIV redox chemistry under previously unattainable, mild conditions. This work highlights the previously unknown coordination chemistry of diamagnetic 18-electron complexes, which underlies the foundation for future innovations in a range of synthetic chemistry. The 18-electron rule, proposed in 1921 by Langmuir1, is a widely taught and used method for predicting the structures and stability of diamagnetic d-block coordination complexes2. Three Nobel prize discoveries in this century3,4,5 and cutting-edge applications, including metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)6, are founded on this rule to a certain extent. This rule is known to have several classes of exceptions, such as the stability of paramagnetic 20-electron nickelocene7, and d8 square planar 16-electron complexes. However, the stability of diamagnetic 18-electron complexes, especially complexes with d6 electron configuration, is the commonly accepted experimental foundation of this rule. Against this backdrop, the coordination of a ligand to a diamagnetic 18-electron complex that results in a formal 20-electron complex is generally considered improbable, even as a reaction intermediate8. One of the most prominent examples of the 18-electron rule is the structure and stability of ferrocene, which marks the beginning of modern organometallic chemistry9. Various derivatives of ferrocene have been synthesized and used in important applications, such as catalysis10, solar cell components11, medicines12, medical devices13, and advanced materials14,15. The versatility of ferrocene derivatives is attributed mainly to their stability, reversible one-electron oxidation under mild potentials, and ease of functionalization16,17. The stability of ferrocene derivatives stems from their coordinatively saturated, formal 18-electron configuration. While reduction or oxidation of ferrocene derivatives to a formal 19-electron anion18,19 or 16-electron dication20,21,22, respectively, requires some of the strongest reductants or oxidants (Fig. 1a), ferrocene derivatives can be oxidized to a formal 17-electron cation at mild oxidation potentials23,24 since the iron center is relatively electron-rich. For the same reason, ferrocene derivatives can coordinate to Lewis acidic species, such as boranes, and cationic or coordinatively unsaturated metal centers25,26,27,28,29 (Fig. In contrast, the coordination of a Lewis basic ligand to iron atom in ferrocene has remained elusive (Fig. For example, ferrocene does not react with CO even under 150 atm30. In theory, this coordination would form formal 20-electron ferrocene derivatives if the η5-coordination mode of the two cyclopentadienyl (Cp) groups does not change upon the coordination31. A bonding model based on sdn metal hybridization and 3c–4e hypervalent bonding predicts the possibility of such coordination chemistry of 18-electron complexes32,33. However, such coordination chemistry of diamagnetic 18-electron ferrocene derivatives is considered unlikely according to the 18-electron rule. Here, we report the synthesis of formal 20-electron ferrocene derivatives by reversible intramolecular coordination of a pyridine ligand to the corresponding diamagnetic 18-electron derivatives. Moreover, this coordination chemistry enables unusually facile stepwise oxidation of the ferrocene derivatives from FeII through FeIII to FeIV. a Reduction and oxidation to 19- and 16-electron species. b Coordination to Lewis acidic species. c Previously unknown coordination of a Lewis basic ligand (:L). To observe the improbable coordination chemistry of 18-electron ferrocene derivatives, we developed a simple X-CpNCp ligand system (Fig. 2a) that could stabilize the expected 20-electron species. Our previous study showed that the H-CpNCp ligand promotes nitrogen coordination to a derivative of paramagnetic 19-electron cobaltocene, a typical exception to the 18-electron rule34. The addition of the Na2[H-CpNCp] salt to a tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of FeBr2 resulted in the rapid formation of NaBr precipitate and a dark red-brown solution. After workup, a dark orange crystalline solid of the Fe(H-CpNCp) complex, 1-H, was isolated in 54% yield. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) study revealed that the Fe···N distance in 1-H is 3.0403(8) Å, and the nitrogen electron pair is directed away from the iron atom, while the two Cp groups are bound to Fe in the η5-coordination mode (Fig. Therefore, in the crystalline phase, 1-H is a formal 18-electron complex without an Fe−N bond, reflecting the expected stability of an 18-electron complex. Consistent with this observation, the 57Fe Mössbauer spectrum of the solid sample of 1-H at 77 K (Fig. 3a, c) showed a doublet signal with isomer shift (δ) and quadrupole splitting (ΔEQ) similar to ferrocene35 (Fig. 3c), and solid-state magnetic measurements by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) supported the formation of a diamagnetic complex. However, in solution, extremely broad 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals were observed at 25 °C (Supplementary Fig. Variable-temperature NMR (from −40 °C to 150 °C) and solution magnetic measurements by Evans' method showed the presence of a temperature-dependent equilibrium between diamagnetic and paramagnetic species. Consistent with the solid-state structure, the diamagnetic species observed at −40 °C showed a 15N NMR chemical shift indicating the absence of an Fe−N bonding interaction (Supplementary Fig. Whereas the 1H NMR spectrum of the paramagnetic species recorded at 150 °C supported the C2v molecular symmetry and indicated formation of N-coordination species. a Synthetic route to complexes 1-X and 2-X (X = H, Cl, OMe, and NMe2). b X-ray molecular structure of 1-H with thermal ellipsoids at the 60% probability level; green circles represent hydrogen atoms. c X-ray molecular structure of 2-NMe2 with thermal ellipsoids at the 60% probability level. d Geometrical definition of Cp ring slip parameters Δ and ψ with respect to the Cp ring centroid (Cpc). a 57Fe Mössbauer spectrum of 1-H recorded at 77 K. b 57Fe Mössbauer spectrum of 2-NMe2 recorded at 77 K. c Fitting parameters for the 57Fe Mössbauer spectra of 1-X and 2-X at 77 K and ferrocene (FeCp2) at 90 K35. d 1H NMR spectra (500.13 MHz, −40 °C) of an equilibrium mixture of 1-NMe2 and 2-NMe2 in toluene-d8, as well as corresponding signal assignments (a–e and a′–e′). Two separate spectra recorded between 380 ppm to −20 ppm and between 20 ppm to −380 ppm were combined to show the entire region with accurate baseline corrections and integration values (see Supplementary Fig. 25 for an uninterrupted spectrum). s: Residual solvent signals from toluene-d8. Aiming at isolating Fe–N bonded species, we synthesized the X-CpNCp ligands with varying Lewis basicity (Fig. The Lewis acid–base interaction between the metal and the pyridine group was previously identified as the key driving force for the coordination of a pyridine group to the cobaltocene derivative34. When most Lewis basic NMe2-CpNCp ligand was reacted with FeBr2, the N-coordinated complex 2-NMe2 was isolated as an off-white solid in 39% yield. Complex 2-NMe2 is air sensitive; however, it is stable under a nitrogen atmosphere at 25 °C for more than a year. VSM measurements confirmed the formation of a high-spin, S = 2 complex with an effective magnetic moment of 4.9 μB (μB: Bohr magneton) at 298 K. The SC-XRD structure of 2-NMe2 (Fig. 2c) revealed a significantly shortened Fe−N distance of 2.1476(10) Å, which is among the shortest FeII–N distances in high-spin, pyridine-based FeIIPNP pincer complexes (Supplementary Table 12). Fe···Cp centroid (Fe···Cpc) distances of 2.0383(6) Å and 2.0393(5) Å are more than 0.33 Å longer than those of 1-H (1.689(4)–1.709(2) Å) and ferrocene (1.651 Å)36, and represent the longest Fe···Cpc distances in FeII ferrocene derivatives37, suggesting a substantial weakening of Fe···C(Cp) interatomic interactions. The coordination mode of the Cp groups was analyzed by the Cp ring slip parameters Δ and ψ (Fig. Δ distances of 0.112 Å and 0.124 Å and Ψ angles of 3.2° and 3.5° for the two Cp groups of 2-NMe2, respectively, fall within the range that supports the η5-coordination mode38,39. In agreement with this analysis, the Δ and Ψ values of η5-coordinated Cp groups in 1-H were 0.074–0.252 Å and 2.5° to 5.9°, respectively. Unlike other ferrocenophane derivatives40, the Cp rings in 2-NMe2 are tilted toward the bridging moiety of the ligand, forming a Cpc···Fe···Cpc angle of 145.92(3)°. This significant inward tilting corroborates the presence of an attractive interaction between the Fe and N atoms. In contrast, the bending of the Cpc···Fe···Cpc angle was much smaller in 1-H (about 170.6°). The 57Fe Mössbauer spectrum of solid 2-NMe2 at 77 K (Fig. 3b, c) shows a doublet signal at δ = 1.15 mm s−1 with a trace doublet signal from N-noncoordinated complex 1-NMe2 at δ = 0.58 mm s−1. Note that δ values more than 1 mm s−1 are characteristic of S = 2, FeII complexes41 and consistent with the spin and oxidation state of 2-NMe2. In solution, the 1H NMR spectrum recorded at −40 °C showed five broad signals between –330 ppm and +180 ppm, consistent with the formation of paramagnetic 2-NMe2. In addition to these signals, five sharper signals appeared in the typical diamagnetic region (0–10 ppm) of the spectrum (Fig. Based on two-dimensional (2D) NMR experiments, selective deuteration of Cp protons, and 1H NMR integral ratios, these signals in the paramagnetic and diamagnetic regions were assigned to N-coordinated 2-NMe2 and N-noncoordinated 1-NMe2, respectively. Notably, 1-NMe2 displays a 15N NMR signal of the pyridine nitrogen at 299 ppm (233 K, in toluene-d8), similar to the chemical shift of the sodium salt of the free ligand at 262 ppm (233 K, in toluene-d8 with THF-d8). The ratio of 1-NMe2 to 2-NMe2 varies with temperature, and the exchange between the two species was confirmed by 2D 1H-1H exchange (EXSY) NMR measurements (Supplementary Fig. Therefore, we experimentally observed reversible formation of the formal 20-electron 2-NMe2 via the coordination of nitrogen to the 18-electron 1-NMe2. Thermodynamic parameters for the formation of 1-NMe2 from 2-NMe2 (ΔHo = −1.98(3) kcal mol−1, ΔSo = −8.1(1) cal mol−1, and ΔG298 = 0.44(4) kcal mol−1 in toluene-d8) were determined using a van't Hoff plot, indicating that high-spin 2-NMe2 is entropically favored, similar to other spin-crossover iron complexes42. The equilibrium concentration of 2-NMe2 is higher in more polar solvents (CD3CN > THF-d8 > toluene-d8) at 230.2 K (Supplementary Fig. 33), likely due to the greater polarity and ionic character of the Fe···C(Cp) bonds (see below), which result in a higher molecular dipole moment of 2-NMe2 (8.3 D compared to 4.1 D for the free 2-NMe2 and 1-NMe2, based on theoretical computations). Interestingly, when the less Lewis basic OMe-CpNCp ligand was used, N-noncoordinated 1-OMe and N-coordinated 2-OMe were observed as a cocrystal in a 1:1 ratio in the asymmetric cell by SC-XRD (Supplementary Fig. Consistent with this observation, the 57Fe Mössbauer spectrum showed two sets of doublet signals corresponding to 1-OMe and 2-OMe in a 58.4:41.6 ratio, respectively (Supplementary Fig. When the least Lewis basic Cl-CpNCp ligand was used, only N-noncoordinated 1-Cl was obtained in the solid state. However, in solution, variable temperature NMR indicated the presence of reversible N-coordination. Therefore, in solution, the coordination of the pyridine groups to the 18-electron ferrocene derivative is reversible, and the strength of coordination is tunable by the Lewis basic character of the pyridine groups. Theoretical calculations also predicted this tunability of the nitrogen coordination and showed that it depends on the interplay of the Lewis basicity of the pyridine ligand, entropic effects caused by the 1-X/2-X transformation, and stabilizing solvent effects. The electronic structure of 2-NMe2 was further investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the TPSSh-D4/def2-QZVPP//TPSS-D4/def2-TZVPP level of theory43,44,45,46,47,48. Consistent with the experimental observation, the calculated structure of 2-NMe2 showed long Fe···Cpc distances (2.017 and 2.039 Å) and a short Fe−N distance (2.1853 Å) (Supplementary Table 2). The optimized geometry of 1-NMe2 is characterized by an Fe···N internuclear distance of 3.0540 Å and Fe···Cpc distances of 1.656 Å and 1.662 Å. In addition, the calculations with the implicit solvent model49 predict that 2-NMe2 should be energetically favored over 1-NMe2 as the polarity of the solvent increases (Supplementary Table 4), which is in accordance with the NMR experiments. Furthermore, in agreement with the experimental results, the calculated thermodynamic contributions reveal that 2-NMe2 is indeed entropically favored over 1-NMe2. This is mainly due to the contributions of vibrational entropy originating from longer Fe···C(Cp) distances (Supplementary Table 5). The frontier molecular orbital (MO) diagrams of ferrocene (FeCp2), 1-NMe2, and 2-NMe2, derived from canonical Kohn–Sham quasi-restricted molecular orbitals (KS-MOs)50, are presented in Fig. The MO diagrams indicate that ferrocene and 1-NMe2 share a similar orbital arrangement, whereas significant reorganization of the MOs is observed in 2-NMe2 as expected from the bending of the Cp···Fe···Cp fragment51. The canonical KS-MOs of 2-NMe2 reveal a \(\sigma\)-type interaction between the formerly nonbonding dz2-orbital and the nitrogen electron pair (Fig. 4, SOMO1–6; SOMO stands for singly occupied MO). The formation of the Fe−N bond results from the fully occupied Fe−N bonding (SOMO1–6) and half-occupied Fe−N antibonding (SOMO2) orbitals, giving the Fe−N bond in 2-NMe2 a formal bond order of 0.5. The formation of this bond is associated with the bending of the Cp···Fe···Cp fragment, which significantly stabilizes the orbitals descended from the lowest unoccupied MO (LUMO) of ferrocene (Fig. The half-occupation of these Fe···Cp antibonding orbitals explains the significant elongation of Fe···Cpc distances. This situation is similar to the 20-electron nickelocene52. Therefore, the stability of 2-NMe2 originates from the formation of the Fe−N bond and bending of the Cp···Fe···Cp fragment, facilitated by the structure of the NMe2-CpNCp ligand. Indeed, an intermolecular reaction between ferrocene and 4-dimethylaminopyridine showed no sign of the Fe−N bond formation, even at 130 °C. The calculations were carried out at the TPSSh-D4/def2-QZVPP//TPSS-D4/def2-TZVPP level of theory. Inset: canonical KS-MOs (isovalues are at 0.05–0.07 a.u. ), blue lobes: positive phases, and red lobes: negative phases. For a detailed MO diagram and KS-MOs, please see Supplementary Figs. HOMO highest occupied MO, LUMO lowest unoccupied MO, SOMO singly occupied MO, SOMO1–6 an MO at six energy levels below SOMO1, npy : nitrogen lone pair. The interatomic interactions in 1-NMe2 and 2-NMe2, as well as the origin of the stability of the 20-electron ferrocene derivatives, were examined by analyzing the relationships between the zero-flux surfaces U, P, and S defined in the electrostatic force \({{{\bf{F}}}}_{{{\rm{es}}}}({{\bf{r}}})\), the kinetic force \({{{\bf{F}}}}_{k}({{\bf{r}}})\), and the electron density gradient \(\nabla \rho ({{\bf{r}}})\), respectively (Fig. The coordination of N1 by Fe1 leads to a significant reorganization of these zero-flux surfaces. Upon the coordination, a notable increase in metal-to-ligand charge transfer is observed, rising from 0.796 e to 1.123 e. This increase is reflected in the expansion of the gaps between \(S\left({{\rm{Fe}}}1|{{\rm{L}}}\right)\) and \(U\left({{\rm{Fe}}}1|{{\rm{L}}}\right)\), where L refers to an atom in the first coordination sphere. In addition to the expansion of the charge transfer region, this reorganization involves \(P({{\rm{Fe}}}1|{{{\rm{C}}}}_{{{\rm{Cp}}}})\) moving away from \(U({{\rm{Fe}}}1|{{{\rm{C}}}}_{{{\rm{Cp}}}})\), while \(P\left({{\rm{Fe}}}1|{{\rm{N}}}1\right)\) moving closer to \(U\left({{\rm{Fe}}}1|{{\rm{N}}}1\right)\). As previously demonstrated, the approach of \(P\) toward \(U\) within an internuclear region reflects an increase in the electron sharing of the transferred density for a polar interatomic interaction, thereby imparting a more covalent character, and vice versa56,57. Thus, the observed arrangement of \(U\), \(P\), and \(S\) indicates that, upon the transition from 1-NMe2 to 2-NMe2, the Fe1–N1 chemical bond forms with substantial facilitation by the electron exchange correlation effect. Concurrently, the transition to the 20-electron configuration is accompanied by a shift in the mode of Fe···Cp binding from a predominantly covalent to a more electrostatically governed “ionic” mechanism. This conclusion is further supported by the enhancement of the internuclear static potential barriers, which inhibit electron delocalization between pairs of atoms58,59, from –1.075(43) to –0.816(78) a.u., and the decrease in the delocalization indices60,61 from 0.455(43) to 0.240(64) a.u. for the Fe···Cp binding upon the transition (Supplementary Tables 9 and 10). Concurrently, following the formation of the Fe1–N1 bond, the barrier height between Fe1 and N1 diminishes markedly from –0.407 a.u. to –0.917 a.u., while the delocalization index dramatically increases from 0.053 a.u. On the basis of the same characteristics (Supplementary Table 11), the formation of the analogous CoII–N coordination bond34 likewise induces a discernible attenuation of the covalent character of the Co···C(Cp) interatomic interactions. Furthermore, the analysis of the Laplacian of the electron density, \({\nabla }^{2}\rho ({{\bf{r}}})\), reveals a pronounced structural distinction between 1-NMe2 and 2-NMe2 (Fig. In both cases, charge depletion is observed in the outer shell of the Fe1 atom, associated with the 4s level. In 2-NMe2, the formation of the Fe–N bond, concomitant with the enhanced noncovalent character of the Fe···Cp binding, is accompanied by the loss of the structured pattern of valence-shell charge concentration at Fe1, attributed to its 3d electrons. This phenomenon indicates reduced directionality of chemical bonding within the coordination sphere of 2-NMe2, relative to 1-NMe2.

Contour maps of \({\nabla }^{2}\rho ({{\bf{r}}})\) for c 1-NMe2 and d 2-NMe2 are depicted using a logarithmic scale of ±1 × 10n, ±2 × 10n, ±4 × 10n, and ±8 × 10n a.u. Blue and red colors correspond to positive and negative function values, respectively. The map planes intersect the Fe1, N1, and C21 nuclei. The distance between adjacent axis tick marks is 1 Å. Intrigued by the presence of the high-lying, half-filled Fe···Cp antibonding orbitals, we investigated the redox property of the Fe(X-CpNCp) complexes using electrochemical methods. Unexpectedly, the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of all the Fe(X-CpNCp) complexes (Fig. 6a, b) showed two reversible oxidation events at approximately −0.8 V and 0.1 V vs FeCp20/+ in THF or CH2Cl2 at 23 °C. Ferrocene derivatives are known to undergo reversible one-electron oxidation to FeIII ferrocenium cations23, but further oxidation to dicationic FeIV species requires more electron-rich Cp derivatives such as pentamethylcyclopentadienyl (Cp*) and use of some of the strongest oxidizing reagents21,22,62,63, due to the prohibitively high oxidation potential and instability of the FeIV ferrocene dication20. The species formed by the two reversible oxidations of the Fe(X-CpNCp) complexes were isolated by chemical oxidations. One-electron oxidation of the Fe(X-CpNCp) complexes with [FeCp2]PF6 produced the S = 1/2, FeIII complexes: 3-X (Fig. Examination of their SC-XRD structures (Supplementary Figs. 75–78) revealed that all the FeIII complexes exhibit the nitrogen electron pairs directed toward the iron nuclei while maintaining the η5-coordination mode of the Cp groups. Consistent with the DFT calculations (Supplementary Table 2), the Fe−N distances for 3-X (2.3785(16)–2.449(3) Å) are significantly longer than that of 2-NMe2 (2.1476(10) Å), while the Fe···Cpc distances (1.7505(9)–1.7582(9) Å) are significantly shorter than that of 2-NMe2 (2.0383(6) Å and 2.0393(5) Å). The elongation of the Fe−N bonds is explained by the presence of an unpaired electron at an orbital with Fe−N antibonding character. Whereas the shortening of Fe···Cpc distances are due to the absence of electrons in the Fe···C antibonding orbitals, unlike in the case of 2-NMe2 (Fig. This explanation was further supported by the presence and absence of spin density at the pyridyl nitrogen atoms and Cp carbon atoms, respectively (Supplementary Fig. Additionally, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of all the FeIII complexes showed similar patterns, with pronounced 14N hyperfine splitting features (Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. This observation is consistent with the presence of spin density on the pyridyl nitrogen atoms, and bonding interactions between the Fe and N atoms. Therefore, 3-X are formal 19-electron, complexes. a CVs (vs FeCp20/+) of 2.5 mM equilibrium mixtures of 1-X and 2-X in 0.2 M NBu4PF6 in THF at 23 °C, recorded at a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1. b A list of the half-wave potentials; †values obtained in SO2 at −40 °C20.

To our surprise, two-electron oxidation of 1-H and 2-NMe2 with two equivalents of AgSbF6 formed S = 0, FeIV complexes: 4-H and 4-NMe2 (Fig. Therefore, FeIII complexes 3-X can be oxidized to FeIV at oxidation potentials near 0 V (Fig. In the crystals, 4-H and 4-NMe2 exhibit short Fe−N distances of 2.0437(14) Å and 2.029(5) Å, respectively (Fig. 6e and Supplementary Fig. Fe···Cpc distances of 4-H and 4-NMe2 (1.732(3)–1.740(3) Å) are also slightly shorter than those of 3-H and 3-NMe2, respectively. The short Fe−N and Fe···Cpc distances induce significant twisting of the X-CpNCp ligands and increased bending of the Cp···Fe···Cp fragment. However, the η5-coordination mode of the Cp groups remains unchanged, supporting the 18-electron configuration of the FeIV complexes. Notably, oxidation of 2-NMe2 with 1 equiv. [FeCp2]PF6 resulted in a mixture of the corresponding FeIII and FeIV complexes, 3-NMe2 and 4-NMe2-PF6, due to the combination of the low solubility of 4-NMe2-PF6 and the FeIII/IV oxidation potential of 2-NMe2 (−0.02 V vs FeCp20/+), which is lower than the FeII/III oxidation potential of FeCp2. The physical oxidation states of iron atoms in 3-H and 4-H were examined using 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and SC-XRD. The 57Fe Mössbauer spectra of 3-H and 4-H (Supplementary Fig. 57) showed a progressive decrease in isomer shifts, 0.68 mm s−1 and 0.48 mm s−1, respectively, consistent with the physical oxidation of iron atoms64,65. Consistent with this observation, the XPS spectra of 1-H, 3-H, and 4-H (Supplementary Fig. 58) showed an increase in Fe 2p3/2 binding energy from 707.6 through 708.4 eV to 709.0 eV upon oxidation. Finally, examination of C–C bond distances in the pyridine moieties of 1-H, 3-H, and 4-H showed no sign of oxidation of the pyridine groups (Supplementary Table 13). Altogether, these observations strongly support the physical FeIV oxidation states of 4-H and 4-NMe2. Thus, the formation of the Fe−N bond expands the accessible oxidation states of ferrocene derivatives, which are among the most versatile organometallic redox reagents66. We expect this new redox chemistry of ferrocene derivatives will expand its use as a redox mediator or catalyst. The coordination chemistry of the NMe2-CpNCp ligand was further examined using other 18-electron complexes. First, we examined the coordination chemistry of a cationic 18-electron cobaltocenium derivative [Co-NMe2]BF4 (Fig. Consistent with the previous study with H-CpNCp ligand34, solid and solution state characterizations of [Co-NMe2]BF4 showed the absence of Co−N bonding interaction. Synthesis of Ru analog of 2-NMe2 was attempted using [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2, however, this reaction also resulted in the formation of a RuII complex without Ru−N bonding interaction, Ru-NMe2 (Fig. These findings suggest that coordination to an 18-electron metallocene is less probable when there are strong metal···Cp bonding interactions, such as those observed in the cationic and the 2nd row transition metal complexes. The strong bonding interactions result in metal–ligand antibonding orbitals being less accessible to accept additional electrons. In summary, if an 18-electron complex can form low-lying metal−ligand antibonding orbitals upon coordination to a ligand, it may be able to exhibit coordination chemistry similar to that observed in this study. It can be hypothesized that this type of coordination chemistry is most likely to occur in neutral 1st row transition metal complexes. The hypothesis is based on the premise that these complexes tend to have weaker metal−ligand bonding interactions and thus have low-lying metal−ligand antibonding orbitals. Stronger bonding interaction between the incoming ligand and the metal will further facilitate the formation of formal 20-electron species by creating a half-filled, high-lying metal−incoming ligand antibonding orbital. Furthermore, this coordination chemistry will be entropically favored, as it pertains to the weakening of the existing metal−ligand bonding, thereby increasing the metal−ligand vibrational entropy. In typical reaction conditions, the weakening of metal−ligand bonding is likely to result in dissociation and substitution of the ligand. However, under circumstances that preclude dissociation of a ligand, such as those engendered by the ligand design or by the presence of excess dissociating ligand, as observed in certain catalytic reactions, this type of coordination chemistry may occur. A potential reaction example that aligns with the specified reaction conditions is the Co2(CO)8-catalyzed hydroformylation reaction under high temperature and high CO pressure. It has been previously established that, under elevated CO pressure, this catalytic reaction occurs through a mechanism that does not involve the dissociation of CO from Co2(CO)867. X-ray structures of a [Co-NMe2]BF4 and b Ru-NMe2 with thermal ellipsoids at the 60% probability level; green circles represent hydrogen atoms. Contrary to the conventional knowledge of the 18-electron rule, we have shown that diamagnetic 18-electron ferrocene derivatives can coordinate an additional ligand, forming formal 20-electron ferrocene derivatives. This transformation is driven by the weakening of the Fe···Cp interaction, which results in a lower-lying Fe···Cp antibonding orbital, and is accompanied by a shift in the mode of Fe···Cp binding from predominantly covalent to more ionic. The partial occupation of these high-lying antibonding orbitals enables the facile two-electron oxidation of ferrocene derivatives. This study expands our understanding of 18-electron ferrocene chemistry and the 18-electron rule and their potential applications in synthetic chemistry All metal complexes and ligands were prepared under an N2 atmosphere using an MBRAUN glovebox, UNILAB Plus SP, equipped with an MB-LMF-2/40-REG regenerable solvent trap, an MB-20-G gas purifier, and an MB-GS-35—35 °C freezer. Precursors of ligands were synthesized outside the glovebox using an argon Schlenk line or under air. All glassware was dried at 170 °C overnight and cooled down to room temperature under a vacuum in the glovebox mini antechamber. All solvents were reagent grade or higher. Hexamethyldisiloxane (Sigma-Aldrich 205389-500 ML, ≥98%), n-heptane (≥99.0%), hexanes (≥95.0%, n-hexane with minor amount of isomers of methylpentane, and methylcyclopentane), n-pentane (≥99.0%), toluene (≥99.8%), benzene (≥99.7%), dichloromethane (≥99.5%), THF (Sigma-Aldrich 401757-1L, anhydrous, ≥99.9%, inhibitor-free), diethyl ether (≥99.8%, inhibitor-free), acetonitrile (≥99.8%), methanol (≥99.8%), dimethyl formamide (DMF, ≥99.0%), 1,2-difluorobenzene (TCI, ≥98% or Oakwood Chemical, 99%), and nitromethane (TCI, ≥98%) were kept for more than 2 days with MS3A in the glovebox and kept in the glovebox. MS3A was dried overnight in a 200 °C oven and cooled to room temperature under vacuum overnight in the glovebox large antechamber. Common chemicals were purchased and used as received unless stated otherwise. Anhydrous FeBr2 (brown powder, 98%, 400831-10G) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 2,6-Bis(methylenecyclopentadienyl)pyridine disodium salt (Na2CpNCp) was prepared according to a published method34,68. Celite filtration was carried out using a pipette, cotton wool, and Celite®545. Celite®545 was dried overnight in a 170 °C oven, cooled to room temperature under vacuum overnight in the glovebox large antechamber, and kept in the glovebox. The dimensions of the 20 mL vial are 28 mm outer diameter and 60 mm in height, and the Teflon-coated stirring bar is 5 mm in diameter and 15 mm long. NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance NEO 500 spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe and an Avance III HD 400 N spectrometer. Deuterated solvents were degassed using argon, dried over dry MS3A for at least 2 days in the glovebox, and stored in the glovebox. 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (δ) relative to TMS (0 ppm) signal with the residual solvent signal (CDCl3: 7.26 (1H) and 77.16 (13C) ppm, C6D6: 7.16 (1H) and 128.06 (13C) ppm, toluene-d8: 2.08 (1H) and 20.43 (13C) ppm, THF-d8: 1.72 (1H) and 25.31 (13C) ppm, DMSO-d6: 2.50 (1H) and 39.52 (13C) ppm, methanol-d4: 3.31 (1H) and 49.00 (13C) ppm, CD3CN: 1.94 (1H) and 118.26 (13C) ppm, CD3NO2: 4.33 (1H) and 63.0 (13C) ppm) as the internal references. 11B, 15N, and 19F NMR chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (δ) relative to BF3·OEt2 in CDCl3 (0 ppm), NH3(liquid) (0 ppm), and CFCl3 (0 ppm), respectively, as the external references. 2H NMR chemical shifts are presented in parts per million (δ) with respect to the signal from the residual solvent as the internal reference. NMR signal assignments of diamagnetic organic and organometallic compounds were made using 1H-1H-gCOSY, 1H-13C-HMBC, and 1H-13C-HSQC NMR experiments. Abbreviations for NMR spectra are s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), quint (quintet), sep (septet), dd (doublet of doublet), td (doublet of triplet), dq (doublet of quartet), m (multiplet), and br (broad). 1H NMR signals of paramagnetic complexes are reported with line width at half-height (Δν1/2) and chemical shift (δ), as the coupling constants are not measurable for these complexes. Air-sensitive NMR samples were prepared in a nitrogen glovebox using a standard NMR tube sealed with a septum and parafilm or a J. Young NMR tube. 1H NMR spectra of paramagnetic complexes (typically 20 mM solution) were recorded with time domain data points (td) of 128 k, delay time (d1) of 0.1 s, scan number (ns) of 1–128, and spectral width (sw) of 200–600 ppm. Proton-coupled 13C NMR spectra were recorded using an Avance NEO 500 NMR spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. For proton-coupled 13C NMR experiments, a pulse program of zg was used with time domain data points (td) of 64 k, delay time (d1) of 0.1 s, scan number (ns) of 64 k, and spectral width (sw) of 400–1100 ppm. Evans' method was conducted using glass capillaries containing deuterated solvent used to dissolve the NMR sample as external standards. The capillaries were inserted into the NMR tubes containing sample solutions, and 1H NMR was measured before and after the insertion of the external standards to assign the signals from the standards. VSM measurements were conducted using the Quantum Design PPMS DynaCool VSM module. VSM powder sample holders (part #: 4096-388) were weighed outside the glovebox utilizing a microbalance and introduced into the glovebox. In a nitrogen glovebox, powdered samples were packed and sealed in the sample holders. The height of the packed samples was 1–2 mm. The sealed samples were taken out from the glovebox and weighed using a microbalance to calculate the weight of the samples. IR spectra were measured using a Nicolet iS5 FT-IR spectrophotometer outside the glovebox and are reported in frequency of absorption (cm−1). Abbreviations for FT-IR spectra are s (strong), m (medium), and w (weak). UV-Vis spectra were measured using a Cary 60 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The sample solution was added to a quartz cuvette (pathlength: 10 mm × 10 mm) in the glovebox, closed with a screw cap, and sealed with a parafilm, and the spectra were measured quickly outside the glovebox to avoid air oxidation of the samples. HRMS were measured using a Bruker timsTOF or Thermo Scientific LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometers, using Electro Spray Ionization (ESI) mode. Elemental analyses were carried out using an Exeter Analytical CE-440 Elemental Analyzer. Empty tin cups (EAI, Catalog #: 6703-0418) were weighed outside the glovebox utilizing a microbalance and introduced into the glovebox. In a nitrogen glovebox, 1–2 mg of samples were weighed and sealed. N2 gas in the tin cups was replaced by argon by three vacuum argon refill cycles. The sealed samples were quickly weighed outside the glovebox using a microbalance to calculate the accurate weight of the samples and promptly placed in an autosampler to minimize the effect of air oxidation. All the samples were combusted and analyzed using the autosampler, which kept the samples in a He atmosphere. All data are available in the main text or the supplementary materials.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prime Day is the perfect time to build out your arsenal of black and yellow tools We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Amazon Prime Day is always a good time to get the best deals on DeWalt tools, and this year's summer event is no exception. Based on early sales, we expect you'll find deals on cordless drills, impact drivers, circular saws, reciprocating saws, and jigsaws across the brand's standard and pro-focused “XR” product lines. There are deals on everything during Prime Day, including most of my favorite tool brands, so if you're specifically looking to buy DeWalt, it helps to narrow the field. Start by going to the DeWalt Amazon store, then click on the “all deals” tab to see what DeWalt products are on sale. DeWalt has historically been a big Prime Day backer, offering good deals every year. That said, I do generally recommend Prime Day shoppers do an extra check to make sure you're getting the best possible sale price. The company routinely puts more tools on sale than any other premium brand. For example, I noticed that there are no deals on tool batteries. This may indicate that DeWalt is holding these deals for Prime Day proper, but it could also indicate a slight pull-back on DeWalt's offering, which is something we've seen from many brands this year. This dynamic duo is a great option for novice DIYers looking to build up a toolkit, or new homeowners who just need the absolute essentials for the occasional odd job. That's ample power for pretty much any summer DIY project you're planning. If you're like me and hate all the extra effort that goes into manually sanding your carpentry projects, then this deal might help you take this edge off the task. This DeWalt XR cordless sander is nearly half-off, giving you a cheap upgrade that will spare your arm. There's even a dust bag to catch some of the sawdust and minimize mess. An oscillating multi-tool can handle a variety of tasks you may run into during your next home improvement project, like cutting through drywall, grinding grout, and sanding wood. DeWalt's XR model is one of the best: Designed for pros, it runs at three different speeds, reaching up to 20,000 oscillations per minute (OPM). Its quick-change accessory suite makes it easy to switch between blade types on complex, multi-phase jobs. At its current DIY friendly price, this tool's a steal. Fall may feel like it's a long way off, but it's never a bad idea to buy your leaf clean-up tools during the off-season, when they're most likely to be on sale. It also has a variable speed trigger you can lock when taking on bigger jobs, saving your hand. This bare 6-1/2-inch circular saw can reach max speeds of 5,150 RPM, which is more than enough power for cutting through plywood, 2x4s, and other dimensional lumber. And at just 7 pounds, it's one of the easier circular saws to use. DIY carpenters and woodworkers will love the discount on this DeWalt jigsaw. It boasts a high blade speed of up to 3,000 strokes per minute (SPM), so you can count on it to cut clean dovetails and circles through wood. If your list of summer projects involves tearing things down to create something new, then this reciprocating saw can help you power through the demo work. With its long, 1-1/8 inch stroke length and max cutting speed of 3,000 SPM, it chews through 2x4s, nails, drywall, metal and plastic with ease. You can load blades in four different positions, making it easier to cut from various angles. I've been using the same DeWalt miter saw for 20 years now and it's still going strong, so this feels like an obvious recommendation to me. This DeWalt portable job site table saw is typically priced for professionals, but this Prime Day discount makes it a viable option for veteran DIYers. It features a 8-1/4-inch blade and produces a whopping 5,800 max RPM, generating the speed and cutting capacity to make tough rip cuts through thicker materials. It also has a 24.5 inches of rip capacity, so you can cut through wider boards. Plus, at 46 pounds it is truly portable–it's light enough for one person to load into a truck, or move in and out of storage. This 20-volt cordless model comes with a HEPA-rated filter and holds 2 gallons of debris. Its 5-foot hose and compact size make it ideal for toting to wherever in the house your project happens to be or for cleaning out the car. It weighs just 8 pounds and has a convenient carrying handle on the lid. It features two hoses: A high-pressure hose for inflating tires, and a low-pressure hose for bikes, balls, and other everyday inflatables. With its LED display, it's easy to read air pressure as you're inflating. I also really like that you can plug this tool into the wall, charge it using a 12V DC car accessory cable, or rely on DeWalt's standard 20V battery.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In experiments with healthy volunteers undergoing functional MRI imaging, scientists have found increased activity in two areas of the brain that work together to react to, and possibly regulate, the brain when it's "feeling" tired and either quits or continues exerting mental effort. The experiments, designed to help detect various aspects of brain fatigue, may provide a way for physicians to better evaluate and treat people who experience overwhelming mental exhaustion, including those with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the scientists say. A report on the NIH-funded study was published online June 11 in the Journal of Neuroscience, detailing results on 18 female and 10 male healthy adult volunteers given tasks to exercise their memory. "Our lab focuses on how [our minds] generate value for effort," says Vikram Chib, Ph.D., associate professor of biomedical engineering at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and a research scientist at Kennedy Krieger Institute. "We understand less about the biology of cognitive tasks, including memory and recall, than we do about physical tasks, even though both involve a lot of effort." The 28 study participants, who ranged in age from 21 to 29, were paid $50 to participate in the study, and were told they could receive additional payments based on their performance and choices. The participants were given feedback on their performance after each test and opportunities to receive increasing payments ($1-$8) with more difficult recall exercises. The participants also were asked before and after each test to self-rate their level of cognitive fatigue. "Our study was designed to induce cognitive fatigue and see how people's choices to exert effort change when they feel fatigue, as well as identify locations in the brain where these decisions are made," says Chib. Notably, Chib and his research team members Grace Steward and Vivian Looi found that the financial incentives need to be high in order for participants to exert increased cognitive effort, suggesting that external incentives prompt such effort. "That outcome wasn't entirely surprising, given our previous work finding the same need for incentives in spurring physical effort," says Chib. However, there may be a discrepancy between perceptions in cognitive fatigue and what the human brain is actually capable of doing," says Chib. Fatigue is linked with many neurological conditions, including PTSD and depression, says Chib. "Now that we've likely identified some of the neural circuits for cognitive effort in healthy people, we need to look at how fatigue manifests in the brains of people with these conditions," he adds. Functional MRI uses blood flow to measure broad areas of activity in the brain; however, it does not directly measure neuron activation, nor more subtle nuances in brain activity. "This study was performed in an MRI scanner and with very specific cognitive tasks. Stay informed with ScienceDaily's free email newsletter, updated daily and weekly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He shoots an aerial photo of the Wordie Ice Shelf, which, 30 years later, has almost vanished after a total collapse. Fortunately, Wordie is a relatively small ice shelf and the sea level rise it has caused can be measured in millimeters. But there are much larger ice shelves in Antarctica, which, like Wordie, could collapse due to climate change. A new research study provides insights that can help identify signs of incipient collapse in these ice shelves and assess the stage of collapse. In their paper, now published in Nature Communications, they present a unique dataset based on the vast archives of old aerial images combined with modern satellite observations, which, for the first time, shows the collapse of an ice shelf as a constant evolution in a long time series. A critical insight that can be used to improve scientists' understanding of ice shelves and the mechanisms behind their collapse. "We have identified several signs of incipient ice shelf collapse that we expect will be observed in other ice shelves, but perhaps more importantly, the dataset has given us a multitude of pinning points that can reveal how far advanced a collapse is. It's a completely new tool that we can use to do reality checks on ice shelves that are at risk of collapsing or already in the process of collapsing," says Postdoc Mads Dømgaard from the Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management, who is lead author of the study. According to the researchers, this knowledge will enhance computer models of sea level rise and lead to more accurate predictions of when the water will rise, allowing for prioritization of investments in climate change adaptation in the most effective way. Warmer seawater and melting under the ice were most conclusive The hundreds of historical aerial photos were analyzed using a technique known as structure-from-motion photogrammetry. The method has enabled scientists to accurately reconstruct ice thickness, as well as its extent, surface structure and flow velocity, dating back to the 1960s. Collapse is tougher than we thought - like it or not According to co-author Anders Anker Bjørk, the new data advances our understanding of how and at what speed these collapses occur. "The tentative conclusion from our findings is that ice shelf collapse may be slower than we thought. This means that the risk of a very rapid development of violent sea level rise from melting in Antarctica is slightly lower, based on knowledge from studies like this one," says Anders Anker Bjørk, Assistant Professor at the Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management. But there is also a flip side to this, he explains: "It was already a supertanker that needed to be turned to stall the melting of ice in Antarctica, but our data shows a collapse process that is even more protracted than previously assumed. This is an unambiguous signal to prioritize halting greenhouse gas emissions now rather than sometime in the future," Anders Anker Bjørk says. As the ice mass of ice shelves is already partially or wholly in the sea, their direct contribution to sea level rise is limited. Although Antarctica is far away, areas like Denmark are being affected significantly by sea level rise caused by ice shelf collapses resulting from gravitational forces. Before Antarctica melts, its ice mass helps pull sea waters southwards. By analyzing differences in perspective between the photos, it's possible to measure heights and distances with high accuracy. This allows tracing how the ice surface, thickness and velocity have changed over time. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.
