                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S.-based BitMine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE American: BMNR), is rapidly transforming the world of Bitcoin and digital asset mining. By harnessing immersion cooling technology and targeting carbon neutrality, the next-gen bitcoin miner is setting new standards for efficiency, sustainability, and operational scale in the crypto sector. With a recent surge in stock price and a $250 million capital raise, the company is drawing attention from both institutional and retail investors seeking exposure to the future of green blockchain infrastructure. BitMine Immersion Technologies has built a multi-faceted Bitcoin mining business designed for performance and scale. Two of these are located in Texas, selected for their robust energy infrastructure and access to low-cost power. This strategic geographic mix helps BitMine maintain a balance between reliability, energy savings, and consistent uptime. Instead of relying on fans and air conditioners, it submerges its mining rigs in a special dielectric liquid. This fluid absorbs heat more efficiently, keeping equipment cooler and operating at peak performance. Hashrate measures how much computing power miners use to validate Bitcoin transactions and secure the blockchain. It's a key indicator of network strength and miner confidence. BitMine Immersion Technologies is also serious about protecting the environment. The company's immersion cooling systems drastically cut energy consumption and reduce environmental impact. This shows they are investing capital in infrastructure upgrades aimed at cutting emissions and maximizing operational efficiency. Research from the Bitcoin Policy Institute (BPI) highlights how bitcoin mining increasingly relies on renewable energy, turning surplus energy into a valuable resource. Using excess power from renewable sources like wind and solar helps stabilize grids and reduce energy waste, proving that it can contribute to carbon reduction rather than exacerbating emissions. This technique involves submerging mining hardware in a non-conductive dielectric fluid that quickly absorbs and dissipates heat. BitMine Immersion Technologies is showing how high-performance mining can also be environmentally responsible. With an initial hosting capacity of 50 megawatts, the company is rapidly expanding across North America and the Caribbean, without losing sight of its commitment to sustainability. It runs on a smart, dual-income model that supports both resilience and expansion. Jonathan Bates, CEO of BitMine, said in the press release that, FalconX, Kraken, and Galaxy Digital plan to partner with the Company to grow a world-class Ethereum treasury strategy alongside existing custody partners, BitGo and Fidelity Digital.” The company is not yet profitable, with a net income margin of -77.8%, as it continues to prioritize rapid growth and infrastructure expansion over short-term earnings. According to experts, its valuation is also on the higher side, trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 14.4, well above the S&P 500 average of 3.1. As said before, it leases its mining equipment to enable fast scaling based on market demand. With new funding secured, BitMine is gearing up to expand its hosting capacity well beyond the current 50 megawatts. The company also plans to deploy advanced cybersecurity systems and smart management tools. It is actively working on launching additional facilities across North America and the Caribbean, adding hundreds of megawatts in capacity. These initiatives emerge at a time when ESG standards are gaining increasing importance to investors and regulators alike. Overall, Bitmine Immersion Technologies stands at the intersection of clean energy, financial innovation, and cutting-edge tech. Its use of immersion cooling makes crypto mining more efficient and environmentally friendly. With a bold carbon neutrality target, fast-growing revenues, and a flexible business model, Bitmine is well-positioned to lead the charge in sustainable blockchain mining.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emerging no-code Web3 creator tools are answering these questions by abstracting smart-contract complexity and automating metadata pipelines. A clear pattern across hundreds of influencer-led campaigns is the shift toward design-centric workflows—whether “sharing to StarChive” from Canva, clicking a “Create NFT” button in Starchive, or using ThirdWeb's drag-and-drop contract templates. In an influencer campaign, every step—from drafting the creative brief to executing on-chain activations—must align with brand goals, timelines, and talent workflows. When marketers attempt NFT launches without coding expertise, they introduce bottlenecks that ripple across deliverables, slow down negotiated partnership milestones, and dilute campaign ROI. Recognizing these technical traps upfront enables brand teams to integrate NFT drops seamlessly into influencer briefs and cadence plans, ensuring that creators can focus on storytelling and engagement rather than wrestling with blockchain mechanics. First, smart contract complexity imposes steep learning curves: defining token standards, enumerating metadata attributes, and configuring royalty splits often requires developer intervention or in-house solidity expertise. This barrier directly conflicts with agency KPIs around rapid ideation and testing, forcing teams into lengthy build sprints or reliance on scarce blockchain developers. Influencer campaigns frequently employ generative-art frameworks that emit thousands of images and JSON trait files. Check out the How Influencers Are Monetizing NFTs Without Launching Their Own Collection Marketers then spend hours merging disparate trait files, reconciling naming conventions, and ensuring IPFS or Web3 storage links align. Converting an influencer's followers into NFT buyers requires seamless wallet setup, marketplace registration, and education on crypto fundamentals. Where traditional e-commerce leverages familiar credit-card flows, the NFT journey often demands cross-platform app installs or private key management—frictions that depress conversion rates and leave marketers scrambling for user-friendly alternatives. Deploying on public marketplaces like OpenSea affords exposure but limits customization of branding, UI, and legal terms. Conversely, white-label SDKs grant stylistic control but require technical integration and ongoing maintenance. Additionally, marketers must navigate emerging regulatory frameworks around KYC/AML, ensuring token-gated experiences do not inadvertently violate local jurisdictions—an ever-shifting landscape that necessitates in-depth legal consultation. When these hurdles are addressed strategically, brands can transform NFT drops from technical experiments into high-impact, creator-led engagements. This alignment ensures that influencers spend their energy crafting authentic messaging rather than troubleshooting smart contracts, preserving brand trust and accelerating campaign timelines. By applying evaluation criteria through this operational lens, agencies can ensure seamless execution across creative, legal, and analytics teams. By rigorously applying these criteria through an influencer-campaign lens, marketers can select platforms that not only simplify technical execution but also harmonize with creative workflows, legal milestones, and post-launch analytics. This cohesion transforms NFT initiatives from one-off tech pilots into scalable, repeatable influencer-driven activations that drive both brand equity and measurable business KPIs. Check out the Top Crypto & NFT Promotional Strategies Used by Leading Brands (with Examples) The ideal solution functions as a centralized “brief-to-mint” hub, streamlining content handoffs, co-approval loops, and drop-day coordination across dozens—or even hundreds—of—influencers. #stitch with @spencer.barbosa check it out if you're going into web 3 #crypto #computerscience #computer #softwareengineer #software ThirdWeb has quickly become a go-to solution for marketers seeking enterprise-grade NFT deployment without blockchain engineering teams. Since its 2021 launch, it's powered drops for global brands like Shopify and The Sandbox, evidencing strong product-market fit. Rather than building contracts from scratch, users leverage ThirdWeb's audited, parameterized modules, dramatically reducing security risk and time-to-market. It's hosted dashboard further abstracts blockchain endpoints, enabling campaign managers to monitor mint performance and revenue in real time. ThirdWeb's open-source SDK fosters active community contributions, but this breadth of options can overwhelm non-technical users, occasionally necessitating developer consultation to implement advanced flows (e.g., lazy minting, cross-chain bridging). Despite robust documentation, learning the nuances of gas-optimization settings or multi-phase drop scripts may introduce operational friction for teams without dedicated Web3 specialists. OpenSea remains the market leader in NFT discovery and secondary-market liquidity, capturing approximately 42% of active users across top marketplaces. Its breadth of categories—from art and gaming to domain names—attracts diverse audiences, making it a powerful amplification channel for influencer-led drops seeking secondary-market visibility. The platform's native royalty engine enforces up to 10% resale fees, ensuring influencers benefit from aftermarket activity. However, OpenSea's templated collection pages lack flexible theming, which can disrupt cohesive brand experiences when audiences navigate from social channels to the marketplace. Additionally, fee structures( 2.5% marketplace cut plus creator royalties) require careful upfront modeling to maintain campaign profitability. Its aggregated marketplace structure sources listings across Ethereum and Polygon, automatically routing users to the lowest-fee option. From a brand perspective, Coinbase's rigorous KYC/AML compliance and SOC 2 security posture deliver institutional confidence, making it attractive for regulated industries. On the flip side, as a beta offering, its tooling for bulk metadata uploads, whitelisting, and collection insights remains rudimentary. Furthermore, upfront fee schedules (mint, listing, and service fees) are still evolving, complicating precise financial planning for agency campaigns with tight ROI targets. Starchive provides a unified DAM-to-NFT pipeline, enabling marketers and influencer networks to mint directly from their existing asset repositories. Its desktop and mobile clients support one-click NFT creation—complete with IPFS pinning—while hosting on eco-conscious Polygon/Palm sidechains. Starchive's granular share-link controls double as whitelisting mechanisms for private pre-sales and VIP influencer tiers. However, its sidechain focus restricts immediate compatibility with Ethereum-centric marketplaces, requiring manual bridging for broader exposure. Additionally, advanced analytics and cohort segmentation for multi-influencer activations are still nascent features. Mintable offers an accessible entry point for creators, having processed over 50 million transactions since 2018. Its flagship gas-free “lazy minting” defers blockchain recording until purchase, eliminating upfront costs and aligning well with influencer campaigns on tight budgets. The platform's step-by-step UI guides non-technical influencers through asset upload, metadata tagging, and listing type selection (auction vs. fixed price). User reviews praise its zero-fee model, but they also highlight potential buyer friction: deferred minting can inflate end-user costs and obscure token provenance until sale confirmation. Mintable's built-in analytics track item views, favorites, and sales, feeding directly into creator performance reports. However, the absence of white-label customization and limited IP verification controls pose brand-risk challenges for high-profile influencer partnerships. For influencer-led NFT initiatives, advanced capabilities become game-changers only when embedded within campaign orchestration systems. Marketers should adopt a “RACI-blockchain” model—defining who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for each on-chain event—then automate handoffs via Zapier or native APIs. Leverage Photoshop-based HashLips scripts alongside cloud storage connectors (e.g., AWS S3) to automatically push trait metadata into the mint queue. Configure auto-trigger workflows so that once an influencer's creative assets are approved in your DAM, they feed directly into the platform's manifest generator, eliminating manual steps and aligning with content-deadline milestones in your influencer brief. For example, pair a signed influencer print with an on-chain token that includes scanned serial-number data. Set up a Shopify plugin that cross-verifies NFT ownership at checkout, unlocking exclusive IRL events or product bundles. Configure your no-code platform to retrieve metadata via persistent gateways, ensuring influencer galleries remain live despite central-server outages. By weaving these advanced capabilities into a unified influencer-campaign architecture—leveraging automation frameworks, decentralized storage best practices, and CRM integrations—brands can elevate NFT drops from novelty experiments to fully integrated influencer activations. The result is a cohesive end-to-end experience that drives authentic engagement, measurable conversions, and scalable campaign repeatability. Strategic alignment between brand teams, agencies, and talent is paramount for NFT launch success. This ensures every influencer campaign—from micro to macro—has clear milestones for asset submission, metadata approval, and drop-day promotion. By treating NFTs as another creative deliverable rather than a stand-alone experiment, you maintain alignment with standard content calendars and reduce briefing ambiguity. Before scaling, run a controlled drop with 5-10 key influencers to test UTM-tagged performance, conversion rates, and wallet-onboarding fidelity. Use these pilots to refine gas-fee subsidies, whitelist criteria, and post-mint email triggers. Design multi-tier influencer campaigns where NFT holders unlock exclusive content, AMAs, or in-person events. Integrate gating logic into your CRM so that mint events automatically segment audiences and trigger personalized nurture sequences. Allocate a fixed pool of “gas credit” per campaign and bundle it into paid social budgets. Partner with platforms offering meta-transactions or sponsored-gas models to ensure that mint fees never derail influencer ROI. Feed real-time mint and secondary-sale data into existing marketing-automation or BI platforms (e.g., Looker, Domo). Tag each influencer's wallet addresses as unique campaign variables, enabling cross-channel attribution models that capture both on-chain and off-chain engagement. This holistic view allows for dynamic optimization of influencer compensation, drop timing, and creative assets. This living repository should capture lessons from each drop—metadata workflows, gas-fee strategies, gating setups—and be embedded within your agency or brand's standard operating procedures to accelerate future activations. By institutionalizing these recommendations, marketers convert NFT experiments into repeatable playbooks that amplify influencer reach and drive quantifiable KPIs. To operationalize this, adopt collaboration platforms that synchronize tasks across creative teams, legal sign-offs, and influencer partners. This ensures every NFT milestone—from metadata approval to gated-content delivery—is visible, accountable, and optimized for maximum campaign performance. NFTs represent more than collectible art; when integrated into influencer campaigns, they unlock new engagement models, data-driven monetization, and scarce rewards that amplify brand loyalty. As brands build internal Web3 centers of excellence, each drop becomes a repeatable blueprint, ensuring that NFTs fuel sustainable influencer ecosystems rather than one-off experiments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Artyfact has launched its first official Play-and-Earn tournament with a $30,000 prize pool. Players earn in-game points by competing in matches and can win both fixed and randomized rewards based on their ranking. The tournament introduces a new seasonal format called “Leaderboard Rush,” where players collect ArtyPoints (AP) during gameplay. Players can also collect points during special capture events on the map. These points determine leaderboard placement and final prize payouts. Top players are rewarded based on their final ranking. First place wins $1,500, second receives $700, and third gets $550. Although the game is free to play, players can increase their AP totals by holding Artyfact NFTs. Items like jetpacks, weapons, and character skins come with built-in AP bonuses. For example, owning an epic-tier NFT grants 9,900 extra AP. Powered by Unreal Engine 5 and running on Binance Smart Chain, the game supports several modes including Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Control, and Battle Royale. Features like jetpacks, transformable vehicles, and map-based power-ups make every match unpredictable. The game also uses an AI system called Player-Experience Modeling (PEM), which adjusts difficulty based on user behavior. This helps new players ease into the experience while offering advanced challenges to more experienced users. Alongside the tournament, Artyfact is running a 35,000 USDT airdrop. Players who complete social media and community tasks can enter, with 1,500 total winners. Ten percent of NFT sale revenue is burned, reducing the total supply and supporting long-term token value. $ARTY is currently traded on exchanges like OKX, KuCoin, PancakeSwap, and Bybit. Artyfact is available now for free download on the Epic Games Store. Players don't need any crypto knowledge or a wallet to begin. Upon joining, each user receives an integrated Artyfact Wallet, allowing seamless access to the game's features. More tournament updates are expected in the coming weeks. We do not share any kind of investment advice. NFT Games are very risky and come with no guarantees.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two European companies — France's The Blockchain Group and the United Kingdom's Smarter Web Company — have expanded their Bitcoin holdings. Following its latest purchase, The Blockchain Group's holdings total 1,904 BTC, acquired at an average price of $106,000 per coin. The Blockchain Group's deputy CEO, Alexandre Laizet, wrote in an X post that the company has achieved a Bitcoin yield of 1,348.8% in 2025. Bitcoin yield is a shareholder-accretion metric created by the world's top corporate Bitcoin treasury, Strategy, when it was still called MicroStrategy. This metric measures how quickly a firm is increasing the amount of Bitcoin backing each fully diluted share by comparing the ratio. The new acquisitions follow a surge in corporate Bitcoin treasury activity driven by favorable market dynamics and the continued success of firms like Strategy, which was expected to report more than $13 billion in unrealized gains for the second quarter of 2025. Those expectations were surpassed on Monday when Strategy reported $14 billion in unrealized gains on its holdings in the Q2 2025. Strategy purchased throughout the quarter, with its most recent acquisition of 4,980 Bitcoin for $531.1 million announced on June 30. On Monday, Japan's top corporate Bitcoin treasury company, Metaplanet, acquired another 2,204 BTC for $237 million. This brings the company's total holdings to 15,555 BTC, purchased at an average price of around $99,985 a coin.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The social media company TikTok, which is currently appealing a £12.7 million fine imposed by Britain's data protection regulator, is set to hire one of that regulator's most senior officials in a move that could provoke concerns about conflicts of interest. It follows the ICO issuing TikTok the £12.7 million ($17.25 million) fine in 2023 for misusing children's data and launching in March what it called a “major investigation” into the social media platform's ongoing collection of children's data. Bonner's move, which was first reported by Politico, has been criticised as an example of the so-called revolving-door for public servants moving from roles in which they held businesses to account into roles at those same regulated companies. Dozens of former public servants have moved into the private sector in fields that directly overlap with their previous roles — particularly in the social media and technology sectors — raising concerns about conflicts of interest, as a joint investigation by Tortoise Media and BBC News reported earlier this year. Civil servants should use their position to pursue the public interest, not their own career goals,” said Mariano delli Santi, the legal and policy officer at digital rights campaigners Open Rights Group. “All former ICO employees in new employment are subject to strict legal and contractual duty of confidentiality, something set out in the Data Protection Act,” Arnold said. The ICO's deputy chief executive stressed that Bonner had “stepped back fully from any piece of work where there could be a perceived or actual conflict of interest” while he worked out his notice period. Mariano delli Santi, the legal and policy officer at the U.K.-based Open Rights Group, noted: “When in opposition, Baroness Jones of Whitchurch proposed an amendment to the Data Bill that would have precluded ICO staff from joining businesses that were subject to public enforcement action.” Delli Santi added that the Labour Party “scrapped this proposal once in government.” “The Labour Party ran on a manifesto that promised to restore integrity in British public life, and the Data Bill could have been a vehicle to ensure the ICO protects people's rights rather than corporate and private interests'. Baroness Jones, who is now a junior minister at the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) which sponsors the independent ICO, did not personally respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for DSIT said: “The ICO is independent of government and accountable to Parliament. All current and former Staff at the ICO are bound by a statutory duty of confidentiality and are answerable to Parliament in pursuit of this duty. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Information Commissioner (“ICO”) has secured a significant victory against TikTok, with the First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) (“FTT”) ruling in the ICO's favour on a key preliminary issue concerning the regulator's power to take action against online platforms hosting user-generated content. In April 2023 the ICO imposed a £12.7 million penalty on TikTok for breaches of data protection law, including unlawful processing of the personal data of children under the age of 13yrs. TikTok appealed against the penalty, notably on the basis that the penalty was ultra vires because it was made “with respect to processing of personal data for the special purposes” (i.e. journalistic, academic, artistic or literary purposes) within the meaning of sections 156 and 174 of the Data Protection Act 2018 (“DPA”). On that basis, according to TikTok, the ICO had no power to issue the penalty notice without first obtaining prior Court approval in accordance with section 174 DPA. The FTT ordered the issue be determined by way of a trial of a preliminary issue. In its decision released on 4 July 2025, the FTT ruled in favour of the ICO, rejecting TikTok's case that data processing  for the purposes of providing the TikTok service is processing “for the special purposes” because it is intended to enable and encourage artistic expression by TikTok users. The FTT's decision is available here. Gerry Facenna KC, Nikolaus Grubeck and Jenn Lawrence acted for the ICO.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, the former “first buddy” who was U.S. president Donald Trump's right-hand man until recently, has announced he's starting his own political party called the “America Party" (while dropping hints he's still backing bitcoin). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" “Nothing stops this train,” Lyn Alden, a financial commentator and founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy, said during this year's bitcoin conference in Las Vegas, a reference to TV show Breaking Bad that she used to describe the U.S. deficit that added almost $2 trillion to the U.S. debt pile in 2024. 07/07 update: Elon Musk has confirmed the wild rumors and speculation that his new America Party could adopt bitcoin, replying to an X user that asked: "Will America Party embrace bitcoin?" While Musk has abstained from directly commenting on bitcoin and crypto over the last couple of years, his car company Tesla continues to hold around 10,000 bitcoin on its balance sheet and his support of U.S. president Donald Trump has coincided with the White House throwing its weight behind bitcoin. An X account called @AmericaPartyX, which is described as a "commentary account" and clarifies in its bio it has “no affiliation,” has repeatedly interacted with bitcoin accounts and posted pro-bitcoin messages, stoking expectations Musk's political party would support bitcoin. Last week, X users were captivated by unconfirmed claims that Musk had "liked" a post suggesting he's "quietly stacking" bitcoin as he rails against the growing U.S. debt pile. "Has anyone noticed how Elon Musk talks a lot about things like overspending and debt and bad government decisions in general, but has completely stopped talking about bitcoin," an anonymous bitcoin account posted, with the account of bitcoin storage company chief executive Seedor known only as Chris, replying: “Maybe be is stacking quietly.” However, doubts immediately surfaced that the account appearing to be Musk's didn't have a verification badge as well as claims that Chris has previously trolled people with photoshopped images. Musk has said he believes president Trump as well as Republican Party politicians who won last year's election on a spending-reduction platform have betrayed voters who want government spending to be reined in. The bill is “one big red flag for fiscal sustainability and one big green flag for risk assets, especially crypto,” according to bitcoin and crypto investor Lark Davis, who wrote in an emailed note that, "this is exactly why we buy bitcoin." “Bitcoin has historically delivered double-digit gains in the weeks after big spending bills," Davis wrote. "Bitcoin jumped 38% when Trump signed a major spending bill in late 2020. And because nothing stops this train, it's hard money for the win during a debt crisis.”</p>

Multiple ‘live' YouTube videos featured Mr. Trump at what seemed to be a NATO press event. The videos were also not shared by any official White House channels. In some such videos, Mr. Trump incorrectly refers to himself as the 45th U.S. President. Screengrab of the deepfake video of Mr. Trump promoting crypto; cropped to obscure a fraudulent QR code and link | Photo Credit: YouTube Throughout the morphed video, which had a QR code and instructions saying ‘Scan QR or regret' inserted into the visuals, Mr. Trump repeatedly urged viewers to send their Bitcoin without hesitation and get more money back as soon as they could. He also gave a speech praising America's progress with Bitcoin, digital money, and energy. While some of the YouTube Live videos had been suspended when checked later, many duplicate versions of the video were still live and running, with some recording thousands of viewers or followers. Mr. Trump's voice and style of speaking in the videos were highly believable, and at first glance it did not look as if his lips were being artificially synced to match the venture he was promoting. Crypto security experts have long decried the persistent trend of celebrity deepfakes being uploaded as YouTube Live videos in order to fool crypto investors. Blockchain analytics platform Elliptic also recently released its report observing that AI tools such as chatbots and deepfake software made it easier to launch crypto crimes and scams. Mr. Trump had positioned himself as a crypto-friendly president in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election, which helped boost his popularity with fintech entrepreneurs and more conservative crypto traders. He has also been linked to the World Liberty Financial project as well as a Trump meme coin, often confusing his followers and fans who are not always sure which Trump-related crypto ventures are legitimate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Block CEO and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has launched the beta version of a new decentralized peer-to-peer messaging service that runs entirely over Bluetooth. Jack Dorsey said his weekend was spent learning about “Bluetooth mesh networks, relays, store and forward models, message encryption models, and a few other things” as he introduced Bitchat on X on Sunday. His white paper goes into more detail about Bitchat, which is a decentralized messaging application that operates over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh networks. According to the white paper, the network would be fully decentralized with no central servers, accounts, email addresses, phone numbers to register, or infrastructure dependencies. It provides “ephemeral messaging,” whereby messages exist only in device memory by default and are not stored on a central database. There is also end-to-end encryption for an extra layer of security. Meanwhile, mesh networking enables automatic multi-hop message relaying, and room-based chat can be set up with hashtag-named group chats and optional password protection. In April, Cointelegraph reported that some popular social messaging apps could be spying on users, hoovering up personal information and messages. Each device acts as both client and peripheral, creating a self-organizing mesh where messages can hop between devices to reach distant peers. The system uses a 30-meter Bluetooth range with bridge nodes connecting separate clusters. There are future plans to enable messaging over WiFi, which will increase the bandwidth for large messages. The system has several use cases, such as conferences, protests, disaster areas, or any scenario where internet infrastructure is unavailable, unreliable, or untrusted. Dorsey is no stranger to messaging protocols, having served as the CEO of Twitter while founding the decentralized social messaging platform Bluesky in 2019. He left the Bluesky board without explanation in May 2024.
