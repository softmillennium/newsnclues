                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There might be even more Argentinian flair on Inter Miami soon. The MLS club has begun talks with Atletico Madrid about a possible transfer deal involving midfielder Rodrigo De Paul, soccer insider Fabrizio Romano reported Monday. De Paul, 31, is entering the final year of his current contract. But there might be some disagreement within Atletico Madrid about taking that approach as manager Diego Simeone would like the club to keep De Paul for at least another season, ESPN added in its report. He scored three goals over 53 total matches for his club team this past season and has 14 goals in 187 career caps for Atletico Madrid. As for his international career, De Paul has become a key player for Argentina over the last few years as well. He started for Argentina in its 2022 FIFA World Cup final win over France and its 2024 Copa America final win over Colombia. Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba currently occupy those three spots for Inter Miami, which is the maximum amount of Designated Players a team can have. While Busquets might be on the outs, adding De Paul would be another player with ties to Messi to join Inter Miami since his arrival in 2023. Alba and Luis Suarez played with Messi with Barcelona before joining him at Inter Miami, while there are eight other Argentinian players on the MLS club's roster. After winning the Supporters' Shield last season in its first full year with Messi, Inter Miami is seeking to go back-to-back and take the next step as a club. Following its disappointing Round 1 exit in the MLS Playoffs last year, Inter Miami is sixth in the Eastern Conference standings, but it only trails first-place FC Cincinnati by 10 points with four games in hand.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2-1 loss to Mexico in the CONCACAF Gold Cup tournament final was still a springboard to next summer's World Cup. Midfielder Tyler Adams said that after a month playing together, the group of younger players felt like a family. “We got so close over these five weeks,” Adams said. “So many guys sacrificed so much to be here, spend time away from their families, spend time away from their clubs and come together.” “But I think we can continue talking, for me it was embarrassing to see in that situation. The game-winning goal by Mexico was also frustrating for Pochettino and his players. The header by Edson Álvarez was initially disallowed for offside, but after a VAR review the goal was deemed good. They won three Gold Cup group stage matches and then two elimination matches to make it to the final. Pochettino believes the younger players who got a chance to shine have discovered their identity. “The most important thing is to have our heads up because I think the tournament was fantastic,” Pochettino said. Adding established national team stars like Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Antonee Robinson and Sergiño Dest can only help next summer. They, along with several other USMNT regulars, decided to skip the Gold Cup to rest or play for their professional clubs. On June 8, former Team USA legend and now soccer analyst Landon Donovan called out those stars for skipping the Gold Cup tournament, saying they needed to take more pride in playing for their country. He had a more positive spin Sunday night after the loss. “Although it hurts to lose, we don't ever take solace in losing, but I think it was a big stepping stone for this team.” The U.S. will have two friendly matches in September, against South Korea and Japan, to see where their progress stands before learning their World Cup draw in December. The question is how Pochettino will reintegrate those big-time stars into a group that took several steps without them over the last month. Pochettino didn't want to talk about the missing guys Sunday night, saying he wasn't going to make excuses. The tournament allowed less-experienced players to gain international exposure and fostered a sense of unity within the squad, which was noted by players such as Tyler Adams. The absence of several key players who chose to skip the tournament raised discussions, including criticism and analysis from former players like Landon Donovan, about commitment and future reintegration. Contested refereeing decisions, especially regarding a denied penalty claim and the VAR-reviewed game-winning goal, were called out by head coach Mauricio Pochettino as points of frustration and potential impact on the final match outcome.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HOUSTON — For all of his experiences managing at some of the world's biggest clubs, Mauricio Pochettino spent this summer learning on the fly. The U.S. logged about 7,500 miles traveling to nine cities: Chicago, East Hartford, Nashville, San Jose, Austin, Dallas, Minneapolis, St. Louis and Houston. Pochettino's side played eight games, with opponents ranging from 17th-ranked Mexico and 20th-ranked Switzerland to 106th-ranked Guatemala. “It's a good experience to be able to feel what it means to be constantly traveling … I think we're learning a lot,” Pochettino reflected last week ahead of the semifinal. It's an experience that will be very useful to us as we prepare for the World Cup.” Pochettino got plenty out of a group of players that was not the team many envisioned he would be coaching this summer (or envision he will be coaching next summer, for that matter). Since arriving last October, Pochettino and his staff had very little time with the player pool. Players would arrive and have a recovery session and one training session, then play a game; then have another recovery session and one or two training sessions before the next game. This summer gave the group extended time together. “We talked about from from day one, this being an opportunity for a lot of guys, myself included, it was an opportunity to to grow as as players, but (also) grow as people, to create a culture and a togetherness that that we've maybe lacked in a lot of moments in the past six months to a year,” U.S. center back Tim Ream said. “I love being able to sit back and watch interactions. And their interactions with everybody is just, it's so impressive. His entire staff, the interactions that they have with players, they know when it's time to be serious and they know when it's time to put an arm around a guy. They know when it's time to poke a guy to get the best out of them, and they know when it's time to have a little laugh and a joke. And I think that's a sign of a great manager, when they can see when those moments are necessary and what those moments call for. And it's been probably the most impressive thing to see with all his staff.” Those interactions ultimately are what build chemistry and understanding within a group. Many of these players have been together since 2019 helping to rebuild a program that missed the 2018 World Cup. That familiarity, though, started to feel too much like comfort in the last year. The Copa América exit set off alarm bells and prompted U.S. Soccer leadership to fire then-coach Gregg Berhalter. In a way, this goal around this summer was to find players that could challenge the “core” of this U.S. team and make them feel that it's no guarantee they'll be called into every U.S. camp. It is not easy to inject that mentality into the group while simultaneously building trust. “They kind of come off as intimidating when you first come into camp, because they have such a good CV. But then once you finally get to meet them, you understand that they're all just big teddy bears, and they all really care about family. … One of the biggest things that we kind of learned this summer is that the coaching staff and players are starting to really understand each other.” While Pochettino undoubtedly got significant value in team building and camaraderie this summer, it may have been more important how he came to understand roster building and depth for a tournament. In some ways, the team he had this summer was out of his hands. Beyond the many players who were unavailable, several players originally summoned for the tournament left due to injury, including Sergiño Dest, Haji Wright, Folarin Balogun and Zack Steffen. Injuries in camp limited minutes for Damion Downs and Johnny Cardoso. But Pochettino's decision to leave off some players who had been involved in the Nations League camp and other competitions hurt the quality and depth of the squad in this tournament. Players like Tanner Tessmann, Joe Scally, Alejandro Zendejas and Josh Sargent undoubtedly would have improved this team's matchday flexibility. There was a balance between sending a message to the player pool and picking the best possible squad to maximize performance. When it comes time to the World Cup, Pochettino will have to hope that the messages he sent were received, because he'll need every ounce of competition and depth, without sacrificing quality. At bare minimum, he should now have a much better idea of the level of the player pool top to bottom. On Sunday after the game, Pochettino wasn't quite ready to talk about the players who weren't there. He seemed a bit thrown by a question about how to integrate some of the regulars who weren't there this summer back into the team. “You already made the list?” Pochettino responded when asked about reintegrating players like Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Antonee Robinson and Dest. It's up to us now to analyze, but all the names you told me, all are under scrutiny, and we are following them. “It's still one year from the World Cup. But now we need to build a roster for September. The answer hinted that there is no guarantee that every “regular” will be back with the group in September. Pochettino's overarching message from this Gold Cup was about valuing every call-up and taking the job seriously. Richards said there were “a few non-negotiables now.” Anything short of those foundational standards will leave you on the outside looking in. Asked Sunday how to carry the togetherness and mentality gained this summer into the full group this fall, U.S. midfielder Tyler Adams was blunt. “And I think that's gonna lead to positive results.” If that's the lasting legacy of this Gold Cup, it will have been a successful first international tournament for Pochettino – even if it ended without a trophy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While several star European players sat out the USMNT's Gold Cup journey, others have taken it in stride and impressed in the team's run to the final, where they fell 2–1 to Mexico. Yet, even those without the impressive summers under head coach Mauricio Pochettino could see a move shortly, as everyone looks to raise their level ahead of next year's World Cup. Already, Johnny Cardoso has moved from Real Betis to Atlético Madrid, but there could be more moves to come, and Sports Illustrated takes a look at a few of the players who could be lacing up for new clubs. The 23-year-old would return to Germany after coming through the Bayern Munich academy, but would do so as a much more polished player, having scored 25 goals and 19 assists in 73 appearances for the Dutch side and been capped 22 times by his country. At the same time, the reported fee of up to $41 million would make him the second most expensive American transfer, second only to Christian Pulisic's move from Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea in 2018-19, which totaled $73.1 million. Given he is a player on the rise and still relatively young, the hope for Leverkusen and former Manchester United head coach Erik ten Hag would be that he can step into the role left by Florian Wirtz's departure, after the 22-year-old left for Liverpool. Patrick Agyemang has carved himself out a key starting role with the USMNT at the Gold Cup and has proven to be one of the best young goal scorers in MLS with Charlotte FC. Now, he appears set to join English Championship side Derby County, in a move that will take him to Europe, but may not put him against a significantly higher level than he currently faces in MLS. Although he won the starting role and the eye of Pochettino this summer, making the move to the Championship puts him in a precarious position, where he will have to adapt quickly and maintain his form if he genuinely wants to challenge for a starting spot at next year's World Cup. One of the most recent call-ups for the USMNT, FC Köln striker Damion Downs appears set to join Premier League side Southampton, according to Sky Sports Germany's Florian Plettenberg. According to Plettenberg's report, the transfer fee would be $9.4 million, with potential add-ons which could see the package exceed $11.78 million, with a contract through 2029. While the Premier League is a big move for any 21-year-old, Downs's record could see him adapt, albeit likely at a slower pace, considering the step up from the German second division, where most of his success has come from. No move is inevitable, but Juventus look to be shopping Timothy Weah this summer, with reports that Nottingham Forest, Marseille, Leeds United, and AS Monaco are among clubs interested in the 24-year-old American. According to L'Equipe, the Old Lady could be enticed by a fee of at least $16.71 million for the winger, who scored five goals and two assists in 30 Serie A matches in 2024–25, but will hope to maintain a significant role at any club he moves to.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is, after all, the first time Kylian Mbappe will ever face his former club PSG after leaving the club on a free transfer last summer. The matchup was supposed to be all the more exciting given Mbappe's legal battles with Mbappe over €55 million unpaid salary case, which led to further cases of moral harassment and extortion. However, in a significant development, Mbappe has withdrawn cases of moral harassment and extortion against PSG. This had prompted an official investigation by the Paris prosecutor's office, which opened a judicial inquiry on June 24 and assigned two investigating judges. Tensions between Mbappe and PSG may soon de-escalate (Photo by Luke Hales/Getty Images) This decision marks a major de-escalation of the legal conflict between Mbappe and PSG. It appears the French superstar and his entourage want to focus solely on his career at Real Madrid and reduce legal tensions off the pitch. However, Mbappé is maintaining his separate claim before the French court. He is still seeking to recover the €55 million in unpaid wages and bonuses from his final months with PSG. In recent weeks, relations between Mbappe and PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi have calmed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bayern Munich's much-anticipated clash against European champions PSG ended in a 2-0 loss for the Rekordmeister, following goals from Désiré Doué and Ousmane Dembélé. This means Bayern's journey in the inaugural edition of the new Club World Cup has come to an end. Here are some observations from the game. Jamal Musiala suffered what can only be described as an absolutely terrible injury to his ankle at the end of the first half, following an unnecessary, overplayed and slightly malicious tackle from Gianluigi Donnarumma at the edge of the field. In what marked the German starlet's first start following his injury in April, this is without a doubt extremely gutting. Even PSG players were horrified by the state of Musiala's leg/ankle area. Musiala deserved far better than to meet such a fate. Having skipped the Nations League to focus on getting completely ready for this tournament, getting injured in such a manner must be heartbreaking. Fans are finding it hard to imagine what Musiala must be going through, let alone what this might mean for his career. His tears and pain resonate with every Bayern fan in the world. Losing time at such a crucial stage in his career, a career so promising and bright, is an excruciating thought. Musiala's talent will be sorely missed — and here's to hoping he is alright. It is difficult now to talk about a football game after Bayern's most important player suffered such a horrific injury. Vincent Kompany set this team up to win from the very get-go. Bayern's quick wing play, speedy buildup by bypassing the midfield entirely, and added focus on going forward were exactly what they needed in a game such as this. Bayern countering PSG relentlessly pressing them with equal pressure of their own was not only a joy to watch but also a brilliant way to face a technically superior team. It quickly became clear that Bayern do not have practice playing with such intensity or against teams of PSG's level. Watching Bayern's defence caught on the counter and scrambling behind lightning-fast PSG forwards became a running trend (pun intended), and that was down to the easily exploitable defensive set-up. In that aspect, PSG's tactics with a more fluid structure that was able to cover ground more effectively saw them maintain a solid defensive structure without compromising their chance-creation. In the end, this is something for Kompany to build upon. There is a lot that can be done here, but it was also clear that this is a game the players aren't accustomed to playing. It is almost every matchday that this complaint pops up: Bayern Munich simply weren't clinical enough. Bayern caught PSG off guard with their setup and were able to penetrate their box far more often, but they failed to capitalize. This came off the back of a fairly weak Michael Olise performance before he settled into the game, and a performance that reminded us why Kingsley Coman was a candidate for sale. Konrad Laimer made his fair share of blunders, and Harry Kane's missed header early on sent what was a surefire goal above the crossbar, a moment that captured his game in itself. Bayern had their moments to capitalize, and didn't take it. PSG weren't far better in the first half. Bayern's pivot completely nullified the PSG midfield in the first half, courtesy of a fantastic game from Aleksandar Pavlović, forcing them to play through their wingers. PSG's wingers rose to the challenge and created clear chances for themselves in admirable fashion (admittedly due to lapses in judgement from Jonathan Tah & Co.), but fell short in front of the goal. João Neves had an early break following a dispossesion of Kane but slowed the pace of the attack, completed a quick one-two, allowing PSG players to occupy the box in their typical 2-3 formation while also allowing Bayern to regain structure. Doué's incredible strike took Bayern's now-structured defense by surprise and sent Neuer the wrong way. By taking chances on the break in a more sustained manner, PSG were able to overcome their limitations and even allowed their midfield to ease back into the game. The same approach showed when they scored the second with just nine men, as Achraf Hakimi toyed with the Bayern defence and laid Dembélé up for a perfect finish. Sure, it does help that PSG has technically better forwards than Bayern. But maybe that is something for Bayern to work on over the summer. Manuel Neuer has been written off time and time again, and he continues to show why he is Bayern's #1. Enough cannot be said about his game today. Almost nothing got past him for the most part. Thomas Müller, unfortunately, played his final game for Bayern Munich today. This is far from the send-off he deserves, especially after everything that went down with Musiala. Yet he almost won a penalty in his cameo and saw the end to one of the most dramatic games in recent history. He couldn't leave without a bit of fun and drama. Good luck to the Raumdeuter in his future endeavors. It is difficult to imagine FC Bayern without him. Sorry, but it had to be said. And this is not because Bayern lost today. The new Club World Cup is nothing more than FIFA's attempt to generate more money at the players' expense. This is a loss that resonates no more than any ordinary game. The tournament crams even more games into the footballing year, whose schedule becomes increasingly more packed every season. And the players are at serious risk. Playing all these games is one thing, but the conditions the players play in at this new tournament are nothing short of diabolical. Musiala's injury came as a result of poor pitch management, causing his leg to get lodged into the grass, which is why Gianluigi Donnarumma's tackle had the devastating impact that it did. And to no one's surprise, the same stadium today is booked for a Beyoncé concert the same week. Bayern have lost their star player likely for an extended amount of time in a tournament that, as it stands today, has little footballing relevance. What did you think about the game?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We look ahead to this semi-final at the 2025 Club World Cup with our Fluminense vs Chelsea prediction and preview. Can the Brazilians cause another upset in New Jersey? They come up against Chelsea, who defeated Benfica and Palmeiras in the knockout stages to get this far. The Blues were made to work for it, with future Chelsea player Estêvão equalising after Cole Palmer had given the Premier League side an early lead. An own goal from Agustín Giay decided it with just seven minutes left, though. However, they come into this game in excellent form. Their 2-1 win over Al-Hilal in the last eight extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to 11 matches (W8 D3). In fact, Leonardo's equaliser came in the 51st minute, which was the first goal Fluminense had conceded in the second half of a match since 18 May, ending a run of eight straight second-half shutouts. That has been in part down to the continued brilliance of Thiago Silva, still performing to a high standard even though he turns 41 in September. The Brazil legend will be aiming to stop his former side on Tuesday at MetLife Stadium. He created five chances against Al-Hilal, his second match with at least five chances created in this year's competition (six vs Ulsan). He also made three line-breaking passes that broke the defensive line, more than any other player in the game. Chelsea have had mixed fortunes against Brazilian opponents. This will be their third match against Brazilian teams in this year's Club World Cup, after a 3-1 loss to Flamengo in the group stage and a 2-1 win over Palmeiras in the quarter-finals. Enzo Maresca has plenty of quality to call on, but it's difficult to look past Palmer as the main threat. Chelsea's Pedro Neto has impressed at this tournament, and is one of only three players with 10+ successful dribbles and 10+ chances created, along with Arias and Man City's Savinho. The latest simulations see them do so just 2.4% of the time, while Chelsea (34.1%) are now second favourites behind Paris Saint-Germain (38.9%).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA slashed standard ticket prices for the Club World Cup  semifinal between Chelsea and Fluminense at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on Tuesday to $13.40, down from $473.90 earlier in the past week. FIFA has used dynamic pricing for the 63-game tournament. Standard ticket prices for Wednesday's semifinal between European champion Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid at MetLife Stadium start at $199.60. The championship will be played there on July 13. FIFA previously dropped ticket prices to $11.15 for a quarterfinal in Orlando, Florida, between Fluminense and Al Hilal and in Philadelphia between Chelsea and Palmeiras. Many matches during the tournament have had sparse crowds. Real Madrid has been an exception, drawing at least 60,000 for all five of its matches, including 76,611 for its quarterfinal win Saturday over Borussia Dortmund in New Jersey. MetLife Stadium is also slated to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup final. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They had just lost 2-1 to longtime rival Mexico, and the pro-El Tri crowd celebrated by serenading them with the song "El Rey." Defender Chris Richards, whose headed goal gave the U.S. an early lead, wanted no part of that ceremony, telling reporters he threw his medal away. But as painful as the moment was, it didn't do justice to what took place over the past 40 days. Starting with the day this young U.S. team first opened training camp in Chicago, this was a side that showed impressive growth, moving past the humiliation of a 4-0 hammering at the hands of Switzerland to reach a Gold Cup final. When the tournament started, that had looked beyond their capabilities. Along the way, several players made significant strides. Center back Richards cemented his role in the starting XI, regardless of who else might be available. Others, like midfielders Diego Luna and Malik Tillman, continued their rise up the USMNT ladder. Then there were new arrivals such as goalkeeper Matt Freese, right back Alex Freeman and midfielder Sebastian Berhalter, who all made positive contributions to the U.S. effort. Will all of these players be on next year's FIFA World Cup roster? "It was a learning experience for every single person in this team. "For some guys, it was the first time playing against Mexico, so to come down here and play in front of however many thousand fans ... I'm happy with the effort from every single player." Finishing has to be clinical, and Luna will rue his first-half shot on goal that flew over the bar. Marking on set pieces needs to be touch-tight, and Patrick Agyemang needed to do better in challenging Johan Vásquez for the header that set up Edson Álvarez's game winner. Richards added that Álvarez's goal, initially flagged for offside, shouldn't have stood. He said: "I think the thing about Concacaf is that I feel like we're always one step behind with the refereeing. And then at the other end we had a block who was offside, and in any other league would've been called offside. They hate us, and we just have to keep moving with it." USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino talks about a penalty not being issued after Mexico's Jorge Sánchez's apparent handball in the box. They had more of their first-choice players available, and it showed. More critically, the longtime U.S. weakness when it comes to keeping possession was on display again. Playing out of the back was brutal to watch at times. The lessons never stop coming, no matter a player's age. One question going forward is whether some of these young players who have taken positive steps at international level continue on that path, heeding the lessons the game is giving them. "I said it to a few of 'em the other day after the first knockout game, they're no longer inexperienced," Ream said. They have to learn from it and understand what it takes to get a game over the line and they will. There were lessons for Pochettino and the staff too. The Gold Cup was their first international tournament, and Pochettino now has a better idea of who can help and who can't. September is a time when the likes of Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Timothy Weah and others should be available. But Pochettino didn't sound inclined to automatically bring them back, saying he would examine every player to see where they are at in terms of form, fitness and attitude. It started with long days on the training field, and that morphed into a grit and desire within the team that Pochettino clearly values, which was absent during the Concacaf Nations League last March. That isn't something he'll just cast aside. Adams, for one, doesn't think Pochettino is bluffing. "I think [the attitude] has to translate right away, or I think Mauricio just probably won't call people in," Adams said. "Because the culture that we have, it doesn't matter who you are. If it's guys here that played well, if it's guys coming back into the group, if you're coming back from injury, just whatever it is, the culture and the emotion is the first thing that he wants to see and I think that's going to lead to positive results." Some of the players in this squad will clearly be included in September, a group that will likely include Richards, Ream, midfielder Luca de la Torre, Luna and Tillman. "I think we understand what the standard is now," Ream said. We understand what kind of culture is wanted from us. It took a little bit longer than it probably should have, but guys are going to be coming in and out. This group will more than likely not be the same group, it won't be exactly the same again. And it's down to us players to kind of drive home the ideas that they want, the culture that they've created." Ream noted that a new generation of leaders is emerging, Richards among them. When September comes, they are the ones who will be counted on to deliver Pochettino's message. "Empower them to speak up, empower them to make sure that they're doing the exact same things at their club that they would do here," Ream said. "Make sure that if they are, whoever's in the next camp picks up where we left off. And again, it's not just created on the field. That's a lot of off-field stuff and I think that's been one of the biggest keys for us in this camp and bringing so many guys along. They'll need to be for this team to move forward and reach its goal of going deep in next year's World Cup.</p>

Chelsea will be hoping to seal their spot in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup (CWC) final with victory against Brazil's Fluminense in the opening semifinal on Tuesday. Here is all to know before their semifinal showdown at MetLife Stadium, just outside New York: Chelsea finished second in Group D to another Brazilian super club, Flamengo. They qualified for the knockout stage with a 3-0 defeat of Esperance de Tunisie. Fluminense, who qualified for the CWC as winners of the 2023 Copa Libertadores, were unbeaten in Group F, finishing second behind Borussia Dortmund with one win and two draws. They played out a 0-0 scoreline with Dortmund in their tournament opener, then defeated South Korean side Ulsan HD 4-2. In their final group fixture, they played out 0-0 against Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa. Silva was a fan favourite at Stamford Bridge and won three trophies during his time with Chelsea, including the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup. Silva is expected to be in the starting XI against his old club. This will be the first competitive meeting between Fluminense and Chelsea. Chelsea will be without Levi Colwill and Liam Delap after both received their second yellow cards of the tournament against Palmeiras in the quarterfinal. Moises Caicedo will rejoin the Blues squad after serving his suspension. On the injury front, Romeo Lavia and Reece James were both held back against Palmeiras and are questionable heading into Tuesday's match. Key defender Rene returns to the club from suspension and is expected to reclaim his place in the starting XI at the expense of Gabriel Fuentes, whom coach Renato Gaucho might redeploy in an attacking midfield role against Chelsea. Talisman Jhon Arias should again lead Fluminense's forward line. Chelsea: Sanchez; Gusto, Tosin, Chalobah, Cucurella; Fernandez, Caicedo; Neto, Palmer, Nkunku; Pedro Fluminense: Fabio; Ignacio, Silva, Rene; Xavier, Hercules, Bernal, Nonato, Fuentes; Arias, Cano Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca said: “I watched some games that they [Fluminense] have played. And you can see that they are very well-organised. And we try to deal with that in a different way.” “It is another step forward, thanks to everyone's efforts. Participating in the Club World Cup is a unique opportunity … We do not know when we will have the chance to participate again. I dedicate this qualification [victory over Al Hilal] to our fans, and I imagine the wonderful atmosphere in Rio de Janeiro, just as it was wonderful here in the stadium, it was a deserved victory.”</p>

FIFA have appointed Polish referee Szymon Marciniak as the man in charge of Wednesday's match between Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain in the FIFA Club World Cup Semifinals, which will be played in New Jersey (21:00 CEST, 03:00pm EST). Marciniak is the most experienced referee in European football and he's been in charge of many crucial games. He was the official in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and he also refereed Real Madrid's 1-0 win against Juventus in this current Club World Cup and the team's victory over Atletico de Madrid in the return leg of the Champions League's Round of 16. Real Madrid have a 6-2-3 record with the Polish referee in charge. Marciniak will have his hands full in this game, as both teams will surely play with intensity and physicality given that they will be playing for a spot in the Final.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American Ben Shelton secured a top in the final 16 at Wimbledon on Sunday, June 5 — and he made some headlines in the process. Shelton, 22, became the youngest American man to make the final 16 at three majors in one season, dating back to Andy Roddick achieving the same feat in 2004. He has also won each of his three matches so far by straight sets. The Florida native also shouted out his friends and family after his third-round win, which included another sports star in United States women's soccer star Trinity Rodman. 10-ranked player in the world is looking for his first grand slam victory, with his furthest finish being the semifinals at the U.S. Open in 2023 and Australian Open in 2025. Here's what to know of Shelton and Rodman's relationship, and why the U.S. soccer star is at Wimbledon cheering on Shelton: Rodman, a forward for the Washington Spirit of the NWSL, has been at each of Shelton's Wimbledon matches. The dynamic athletes went public with their relationship on March 18 after Shelton posted pictures to Instagram. Shelton even shouted out Rodman after his third-round win on July 5 over Marton Fucsovics. "It's not just been me here, I have a great team. My parents are here, my girlfriend's here," Shelton said as the ESPN broadcast panned to Shelton's parents and Rodman in the stands. Rodman is a 23-year-old soccer player who's one of the best scorers for the U.S. Women's National Team. Rodman, the daughter of Basketball Hall of Famer Dennis Rodman, scored three goals at the 2024 Paris Olympics to help lead the United States to a gold medal. She was also the youngest person ever drafted to the NWSL (18 years old) after going No. Rodman's signature moment of her young USWNT career came in the knockout round against Japan, when she sent the U.S. to the semifinals of the 2024 Paris Olympics after scoring an extra-time goal to win 1-0. Her brother, DJ Rodman, played basketball at Washington State and USC.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>United States Men's National Team head coach Mauricio Pochettino started the press conference after his team's 2-1 loss in the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup Final by congratulating the victors, Mexico, not just once but twice – in both English and Spanish. In a match deemed World Cup caliber because of its intensity, high level of competition and setting, a United States lineup that averaged just 23 caps gave the defending champions a run for their money. The result put the U.S. one win away from a trophy, and one win away from Pochettino's first title since being named USMNT head coach in September 2024, a fact the manager acknowledged as “very painful.” But even though his team came up short on the night, Pochettino's outlook, like his introduction, was positive and focused on building. “It's a massive lesson for us,” Pochettino said. Only five starters had faced Mexico before. For several players, it marked the first time seeing the regional rival in their international careers. This tournament gave players quality experience on a big stage. It also allowed Pochettino, in his first year as head coach, to get to know his players more during this 40-day camp and see what they're capable of on the pitch. The United States completed group play unbeaten, winning all three matches while conceding just one goal. In the knockout stage, the U.S. faced two tough opponents, Costa Rica and Guatemala – one in a penalty kick shootout and one in a particularly loud and hostile environment. The U.S. prevailed both times to advance, showing tremendous fight and poise, and clear a path toward the program's 13th Gold Cup Final. “I am so proud about the team,” Pochettino said. Sunday night's environment gave the world a taste of what next summer will be like – NRG Stadium, where tonight's Gold Cup Final was held, is one of America's World Cup venues in 2026. As one of the host countries next summer, the United States will want to perform well and make a deep run. If the Gold Cup is any indicator, the United States is sure to be competitive and bring a deep squad when the world's biggest soccer tournament arrives on American soil. “The most important thing is to have our head up because I think the tournament was fantastic,” he said. That is the way that we want to build our journey to the World Cup. In this way, I have no doubt that we are going to be really, really competitive and going to be difficult for the opponent.” A post shared by U.S. Soccer MNT (@usmnt)</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HOUSTON — For 23 fleeting minutes here at NRG Stadium on Sunday night, the U.S. men's national team was back atop CONCACAF. It was beating Mexico, 1-0, in the Gold Cup final, and rising past expectations, toward a regional summit. But in the end, it succumbed to a better team — El Tri, which came back to win 2-1 and claim Mexico's 10th Gold Cup title. Edson Álvarez's 77th-minute goal, awarded after a dramatic VAR review, was the difference. An hour and a half earlier, before some of 70,925 fans here could even settle into their seats, the U.S. was ahead. Patrick Agyemang won a free kick on the right. Chris Richards hunted it, and nodded a world-class header over Mexican goalkeeper Luis Malagón, onto the crossbar, and narrowly over the line. The head referee, Mario Escobar, noticed it and whistled for a goal. Richards wheeled away in celebration, with a finger to his ear, as U.S. teammates erupted. Throughout a fascinating first half, though, Mexico's quality began to show. Álvarez, 16-year-old Gilberto Mora and Marcel Ruíz began to run the show. The U.S. struggled to cope with their movement in midfield, and struggled to get out of its defensive shell when possession changed hands. From Richards' goal until first-half stoppage time, the Americans didn't take a single shot. Tyler Adams got caught between him and Alexis Vega. U.S. right back Alex Freeman got caught in “no-man's land,” and didn't recover quick enough to Ruíz. Ruíz slid a clever reverse pass to Raúl Jiménez, who finished like the most accomplished player in the field — which he was. In fact, the Americans never truly lost their footing. They limited Mexico to very few legitimate looks at goal. But they failed to create much of anything going forward. Several players showed their inexperience under the “pressure” and “stress” that head coach Mauricio Pochettino promised this game would bring. The USMNT, with no true wingers, offered essentially zero vertical threat. But Álvarez got the last laugh, with his diving header off a flicked free kick. It had come a long way, from the brink of crisis to this final, but it couldn't quite clear the last — and tallest — hurdle. Less than four weeks ago, the Americans were reeling. After a 4-0 capitulation to Switzerland, their fourth straight loss, “everyone basically counted us out,” defender Tim Ream later said. In the sanctity of locker rooms and meal rooms, though, on flights and training fields, throughout their last true tournament before the 2026 World Cup, they jelled. Richards and others also used that word, family. Ream felt like he'd added “20 more kids” to his. Over 3 million people tuned into their quarterfinal, and didn't see Christian Pulisic or Weston McKennie; but did see Luna and a group of likable underdogs who, as Pochettino said, were “desperate” to “represent our country, and … fight for our flag, for our shirt.” They came to Houston with some expectations already met. “I think there's been a lot of success this summer, with how the team's grown,” Richards said Saturday. “But me personally,” he continued, “I like to win trophies — especially against Mexico.” When Pochettino gathered players and staff before training this weekend, he recounted a trophy-lifting dream he'd had the night before. And he told them, per Freese: “We did not come here to be a second-place team.” Their problem, though, was that they came with second-place talent. They came with a six-game unbeaten streak against Mexico in official matches, but without Pulisic and McKennie, without Sergiño Dest and Antonee Robinson, without several architects of the streak, players who could equal Mexico's Álvarez and Jiménez. And besides: “Streaks are meant to be broken,” Jiménez said Saturday in Spanish. “And we think tomorrow is a great day for us to break [this one].” They became the first team to successfully defend a Gold Cup title since their Mexican predecessors went back-to-back in 2009 and 2011. They will head into North America's home World Cup next summer as the outright kings of the continent once again.</p>
