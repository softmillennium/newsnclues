Universal and Amblin's Jurassic World Rebirth came in well ahead of expectations at the Fourth of July box office to hatch a new era for the Steven Spielberg-created franchise. In North America, the holiday tentpole is reporting a five-day domestic opening of $147.8 million, including $92 million for the three-day weekend, according to final numbers. Jurassic World Rebirth, the seventh title in the series, is roaring even louder overseas, where it opened to an estimated $174.8 million from 82 markets. James Gunn Says 'Superman' Is About an "Immigrant That Came From Other Places" 'Jurassic World Rebirth' Star Luna Blaise Is Just Really Excited to Be Here It even bit off a big number in China, where Hollywood tentpoles can no longer depend upon big grosses. Rebirth debuted to $41.5 million to score the biggest opening of the year so far for a Hollywood title. That's no small feat considering July 4 fell on a Friday this year, meaning many moviegoers were distracted by holiday outings on what's normally a critical day for new films. To boot, the latest Jurassic World pic has received decidedly mixed reviews from both critics and audiences alike (one example: it earned a meh B CinemaScore from moviegoers). Following the conclusion of the Jurassic World trilogy directed by Colin Trevorrow, Spielberg, Amblin and Universal, they went back to the drawing board and enlisted filmmaker Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) to direct Rebirth from a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp. If all goes well, it will be the first title in another trilogy, according to insiders. The film features an all-new cast anchored by Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali and Jonathan Bailey. The first three Jurassic World pics all grossed north of $1 billion globally, and all opened higher than Rebirth domestically (comparisons are complicated by the fact that those were all three-day, non-holiday openings). In 2015, Jurassic World opened to a franchise-best $208.8 million, followed by $148 million for 2018's Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and $145 million for 2022's Jurassic World: Dominion, not adjusted for inflation. The first Jurassic Park, directed by Spielberg, opened to $47 million domestically in early June 1993, not adjusted for inflation — a huge sum at the time. Also setting off fireworks at the box office was Brad Pitt's F1: The Movie, which has already earned nearly $300 million globally, including a 10-day domestic tally of $109.2million. From Apple Original Films in partnership with Warner Bros., F1 came in second over the holiday weekend with an estimated three-day gross of $25.7 million. Universal was a double winner at the holiday box office as DreamWorks Animation's live-action How to Train Your Dragon came in third place with an estimated $11 million for a domestic tally of $224 million. Pixar and Disney's troubled pic Elio came in fourth with an estimated $5.7 million for a muted domestic tally of $55.1 million. Danny Boyle and Sony's 28 Years Later rounded out the top five domestically with $4.6 million for a domestic haul of $60.2 million. Blumhouse and Atomic Monster's ill-fated M3GAN 2.0 fell off somewhat less than expected, or 62 percent, in its second weekend to an estimated $3.8 million after bombing in its debut a week ago. The Universal releases tied for sixth place with Disney's live-action Lilo & Stitch, which is likewise reporting a three-day gross of $3.8 million. Lilo & Stitch made major headlines in passing up A Minecraft Movie to become the top-earning pic of 2025 at the worldwide box office after finishing Sunday with a global total of $972.7 million. Elsewhere on the top 10 chart, fellow Memorial Day release Mission: Impossible: The Final Reckoning finished Sunday with a global haul of $576.2 million.

Updated: A source close to the series tells IndieWire that the deceased “dad” in Season 1 of “And Just Like That” is Lisa Todd Wexley's stepfather. On last week's episode of “And Just Like That” Season 3, titled “Silent Mode” and written by Susan Fales-Hill, moneyed Park Avenue documentary filmmaker Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker) was forced to mourn the unexpected offscreen death of her father (Billy Dee Williams). However, as some “Sex and the City” fans on social media observed, Lisa's father had already died — in Season 1. Related Stories Lena Dunham ‘Understands' How Lack of Diversity in ‘Girls' Was ‘Really Disappointing' for Audiences Ben Stiller's All-Star Comedy Roundtable Celebrates 30th Nantucket Film Festival The episode “Silent Mode” showed Lisa attending her father's funeral at a local theater — he was a stage actor — but as fans pointed out (see the TikTok below), Lisa told her friend Charlotte Goldenblatt (Kristin Davis) in Season 1 that she had lost her father the previous year. Williams played her father, Lawrence Todd, in the Season 2 episode “ALIVE!” But at that point, Lisa had already said he'd died, too. Back in Season 1 circa Big's (Chris Noth) funeral, Lisa had told Charlotte, “I was exactly the same when my father died last year” with regard to Carrie's (Sarah Jessica Parker) grief. One of the social media theories is that Lisa has two gay dads, but the Darren Starr-created series, showrun by Michael Patrick King, hasn't exactly established that possibility. Nicole Ari Parker's character is one of the Samantha Jones stand-ins the series employed in Season 1 when Kim Cattrall declined to reprise her iconic role. Series continuity errors aren't uncommon even in “And Just Like That” as, per People, other users pointed out that Harry Goldenblatt's (Evan Handler) mother died 10 years before the start of Season 2.

James Gunn is shutting down the assumption that “Superman” has to be a box office blockbuster. “They hear these numbers that the movie's only going to be successful if it makes $700 million or something and it's just complete and utter nonsense. “Superman” opens in theaters July 11 from Warner Bros. and DC Studios. Related Stories Dakota Johnson: ‘I Dream of Playing' a Psychopath Michael Douglas Says He's ‘Not Retired' but Also Isn't Looking for Roles: I Don't Want to Drop ‘Dead on the Set' “I mean, ‘Superman' is the story of America,” Gunn said. “An immigrant that came from other places and populated the country, but for me it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost. Do you never kill no matter what — which is what Superman believes — or do you have some balance, as Lois believes? It's really about their relationship and the way different opinions on basic moral beliefs can tear two people apart.” Gunn further told Rolling Stone that unlike Disney's MCU, WBD does not have a quota for DCU films. “We don't have the mandate [at DC] to have a certain amount of movies and TV shows every year. We're obviously going to do some good things and some not-so-good things, but hopefully on average everything will be as high-quality as possible,” Gunn said. “Nothing goes before there's a screenplay that I personally am happy with.” “Batman's my biggest issue in all of DC right now, personally,” Gunn said. “I'm not writing ‘Batman,' but I am working with the writer of ‘Batman' [Matt Reeves] and trying to get it right, because he's incredibly important to DC, as is Wonder Woman.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Country superstar Luke Bryan is used to critiquing and mentoring rising stars on “American Idol,” but on July 6, 2025, fans of A&E's “Duck Dynasty: The Revival” may have been surprised to see him show up on the show to do the same with 23-year-old cast member Will Robertson, the son of family patriarch Willie Robertson. So how did Bryan wind up on the episode? The original “Duck Dynasty” aired for 11 seasons on A&E. After eight years, Willie and Korie Robertson returned to TV on June 1 with “Duck Dynasty: The Revival,” now navigating their lives with adult kids and grandchildren, and still managing the Duck Commander business in Louisiana. “My dad and Luke Bryan have been friends for a very long time,” Will told Parade before the episode premiered. “I'm sure my dad went to a few of his concerts. Then Luke joined my dad's Buck Commander team as one of the buckmen, so they hunt a lot together.” When Will asked Bryan during the episode for advice on how to get into the mindset for writing a song, Bryan told him, “I think you kind of just gotta find a place that's your place to kind of do your work. Will has been living in Texas with his wife Abby while the rest of the Robertson crew remained in Louisiana, and missing home inspired him to pen a tune called “Home” with Bryan's assistance. “It really helped a lot,” Will told the outlet. “And it was also just good to sit down with a family friend that we haven't seen in a while, (with) how busy he is with all that he's doing. In February, they posted a video of their first-ever duck hunting expedition on Bryan's Tennessee farm, complete with the country star hilariously driving Willie crazy with his duck calls. He's had some memorable performances with Willie over the years, including their funny “Rattlesnake” tune and performing “Hairy Christmas” on the Country Music Association's ABC Christmas Special in 2011.</p>

People have forgotten Landgraf originally ran the company that produced “Reno 911” before he became the town crier yelling “peak Tv” and this is yet another Comedy Central style mockumentary featuring a diverse cast of comedians, obvious situations with safe and predictable hilarity ensuing. When's the last time we've heard a comedy premise that sounded innovative? To me, “Reno 911” was always “Police Academy” without a script. I haven't seen Robert Ben Garant in a while. He appeared to be off RENO 911, and didn't participate in the State reunion, or even the festivities around Keri Kenney-Silver's Four Seasons.

She's currently in post-production on her latest project, Street Smart, which she describes as “a kind of homeless The Breakfast Club” starring Yara Shahidi, Isabelle Fuhrman, Michael Cimino, and a group of unknowns with “big hearts and compassion for others; otherwise, they would be trying to work on a superhero film.” In addition to serving as a “love letter to Venice” (the California neighborhood), the film is also a rebuke of Donald Trump's politics. “Even though we wrote it before he got elected, Street Smart is directly addressing some of [these] issues,” Hardwicke said. “It's telling a compelling story that shows people who do not look like Donald Trump, or think like him.” Hopefully, this film will lead to more opportunities for the director; or, if nothing else, at least a full-size dessert.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Multiple HGTV stars impacted by major programming changes at the network, including five series cancellations announced since mid-June 2025, held their heads high over the 4th of July holiday weekend, finding the good as they face tough circumstances. From “Bargain Block” star Keith Bynum sharing an upbeat message amid his show's cancellation to the stars of just-canceled “Married to Real Estate” hanging out with the stars of “100 Day Dream Home” in Florida, fans were inspired by the stars' resiliency and expressed hope they'd all land on their feet. Bynum, co-star of “Bargain Block” with his partner Evan Thomas, told fans on July 5 that they were “starting to feel like life is going to be right again” three weeks after revealing their show was not renewed for a fifth season. He wrote, “Hope everyone had a great 4th of July! Sharing how touched they and Shea Hicks-Whitfield, their realtor co-star, have been by the response to their show's cancellation, Bynum continued, “Me, Evan and Shea have been shocked beyond belief to see the response and we're so grateful. Fans flooded Bynum's post with more support, including one who wrote, “You guys (and that includes Shea!) I hope this isn't the last we'll be seeing you on television.” On June 23, Egypt Sherrod revealed to fans via Instagram that she and her husband, Mike Jackson, had returned from a family vacation to the news from HGTV that their show, “Married to Real Estate,” had not been renewed for a fifth season. Sherrod posted multiple photos from their trip to Clearwater and St. Petersburg, writing, “Photo Dump! Just a simple break visiting family and friends while counting our blessings. 👏🔥” and, using her professional consulting agency account, she added, “We need to double date more often, next time we hit the town in ATL❤️🔥👏” Sherrod and Jackson also both posted photos of them kissing on the beach, along with other family pics from their trip. A post shared by Heather Rae El Moussa (@theheatherraeelmoussa) Another duo who bonded over the 4th of July were girlfriends Alison Victoria and Taniya Nayak. Victoria and Nayak both posted photos in their Instagram Stories of themselves together with an ocean view behind them. “I had never met Alison, and on day one, we hung out together, and we immediately became best friends,” she told the outlet. Although Taniya does not have another HGTV series lined up on the network, Victoria co-stars with Retta on “Ugliest House in America” and “Scariest House in America,” and is expected to debut her new series “Sin City Rehab” in the fall. Meanwhile, a far more unlikely HGTV duo who've become good friends — Heather Rae El Moussa and Christina Haack — also spent the 4th of July together.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The "Antichrist Superstar" performer was not on hand for Saturday's all-star tribute. Marilyn Manson was not part of the line-up for Saturday's (July 5) epic Back to the Beginning final concert by a reunited Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne. While a murder's row of hard rock and heavy metal superstars took the stage at Villa Park in Birmingham, England to fête the Prince of Darkness in what was billed as Osbourne's last-ever show with original Sabbath mates guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler and drummer Bill Ward, Manson beamed in with a video message paying homage. But based on some fan reaction to the gesture, it was not well-received by all. In the clip, Manson (born Brian Warner), 56 — who was accused in lawsuits from four women of sexual assault and domestic abuse — said, “It is a great honor to be here via this video,” according to the NME. “Eurgh Marilyn Manson making an appearance on the sabbath stream. F–k that guy he's a rapist piece of s–t,” wrote one, with others adding, “Marilyn Manson on the black sabbath stream f–k off” and “disgraceful that he is on this otherwise outstanding Black Sabbath show.” It did not appear as if Manson, who performed on Ozzfest in 1997, 2001, 2003, 2017 and 2018, and, like many on the bill has long cited Osbourne and Sabbath as a formative rock influence, was invited to participate in Saturday's show. The feeling of some was summed up by another tweet that read, “ew marilyn manson go away.” Manson has long denied the sexual abuse allegations, which have resulted in his being dropped by his label, manager and booking agent, and, most recently, the Oct. 29 One Assassination Under God tour kick-off gig in Brighton, U.K. getting cancelled at the urging of members of Parliament.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last week, Jon Bauman paused in the middle of a Zoom call with Rolling Stone, put on his glasses and glanced up at a TV screen in his home. No one's ever tried to do anything like this before. It's a horrible idea, and it's all in service of giving the wealthiest Americans a tax cut they don't need. If Bauman's name doesn't immediately ring any bells, his alter ego should. But these days, Bauman has his fist raised for a different reason. That phase of his life kicked in even harder in 2017, when he joined the Social Security Works Political Action Committee (PAC), an advocacy group that endorses and donates to candidates supportive of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, some of which are now imperiled by last week's vote. “Besides being Bowser, I'm pretty much a public policy wonk. And for better or worse, I do understand how this stuff works, and I do understand who you elect to public office makes all the difference in the world and how these things play themselves out.” As he wrote in one of his many vitriolic recent X posts, “Some Trumpers want to know what we learned from the last election. We learned you don't give a f*ck about anything but beating us. You don't give a f*ck about your Social Security. You don't give a f*ck about your Medicare. You don't give a f*ck about your drug prices.” (When another questioned his expertise and relevance, he replied, “Eat shit. Bauman's past is never that far back in the rearview mirror. In this year's One to One: John & Yoko doc, about the show and their lives in New York during that period, we see the concert's climactic moment: a sing-along of “Give Peace a Chance,” with … Sha Na Na? “So I'm not surprised that people wanted us to do stuff. That clip was a reminder of how big Sha Na Na were, for a time, part of a retro nostalgia movement that also included American Graffiti, Happy Days, and the original Grease stage show. “People on our crew were saying, ‘You gotta check out this local guy, he's really good,'” Bauman says. You listen to the second song, ‘That's really good.' By the fifth song, you're going, ‘ I hope we can follow this guy. Texas Floods: At Least 80 Dead as Rescue Efforts Continue Amid New Flash Flood Warnings Watch Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong Lead Crowd in Chant of ‘Fuck Donald Trump' Bauman left Sha Na Na in the Eighties, moving on to a career that came to include acting roles (one episode of Miami Vice), voiceover work (My Little Pony), a brief VJ stint (on VH1), and years of touring as part of his Bowzer-fronted oldies show. “The names weren't properly protected, and [the original members] were just getting savaged by unscrupulous people who were pumping out dozens of Coasters and dozens of Drifters and dozens of Platters,” he says. “In the meantime, the audience is also being deceived, because they think they're going to see something that has some connection to the actual group, and they're actually just seeing a tribute show.” The bills have allowed state attorneys general to contact a venue about a pending “imposter” show, resulting in many being canceled. The turning point in Bauman's unexpected pivot to health-care advocate came with the 2000 presidential election, where George W. Bush prevailed over Al Gore. “It should never have gone to the United States Supreme Court,” he says. In the process, Brauman educated both himself and his assistance-inclined fan base about programs that Republicans have, to his disgust, called “entitlements.” “I understood that this was where my best usefulness was, and made myself an expert on senior issues, which you have to be if you're going to do this kind of work,” he says. I did not want to return to a time before Medicare was passed in 1965 when over 35 percent of American seniors had incomes below the poverty line.” “It was just some guy who owned a bunch of casinos,” he says. This is a guy who said, ‘I will not cut Medicaid,' and they're busy throwing at least 12 million people off it, and 17 million people altogether off of their health insurance. So, I mean, this guy just seems to be an inveterate liar.” Like many, Bauman says he struggles to understand Republican support for the bill that was signed into law last week. “This Big Ugly Bill is going to have terrible consequences for rural hospitals and nursing homes,” he says. “If this bill passes, and Medicaid is attacked in the way they're proposing and those hospitals close, don't think you're escaping because you go to another hospital. Your hospital is going to get overrun by patients from the hospitals that close. Everybody's going to be out on the street when that nursing home closes. Now that Trump has signed the bill into law, Bauman is putting his hope in what the calls “our consolation prize,” a backlash that would benefit Democrats in next year's midterms. He's also intrigued by Elon Musk's proposal to start a third political party. “I have always felt that this is a coalition of the greediest among us and the most bigoted among us,” he says. That's exactly what this new Social Security propaganda actually is.” ‘Love Island' Dumps Contestant Cierra Ortega After Posts Using Racial Slur Surface ‘Alligator Alcatraz' Detention Center Poses Serious Risks to Immigrants Beyond Just Alligators Ozzy Osbourne Gives Earth-Shaking Farewell at Black Sabbath's Back to the Beginning Early this year, Bauman wrapped up his long-running “Rock ‘n' Doo Wop Party,” a tour that featured him and other period legends like Chubby Checker and Gary “U.S” Bonds. The wear and tear of age had something to do with Bauman's retirement from the road, although he gives props to those even older veterans still out there: “If I had the repertoire of a Paul Simon, I would probably still be doing it too.” Bauman largely kept his political raps out of the show but admits that in the final performances in January, he couldn't help himself. “I started talking much more about Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and senior issues, because my audience is older, and these things apply to them in a very direct and not particularly partisan way,” he says. The country is in a very dangerous spot where we're facing an attempt at an authoritarian takeover in every way, shape, matter, or form. I would like to convince them that our country is worth saving.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ever since Jurassic World decided that regular ol' dinosaurs just weren't good enough for its in-universe paying audience, and therefore not good enough for those continuing to pay to see these movies, the series' mutant hybrid killing machines have straddled the line between being meta-critiques of the demands on the franchise and edgelord dino bullshit. The dinos, like all movie sequels, needed to get bigger, flashier, more badass. It led to the ridiculous Indoraptor, which acted like a dinosaur serial killer for reasons beyond comprehension. At the very least, we are spared one or more characters yelling, “They fly now? Distortus rex, the monster that's been teased since the film's Final Destination-style cold open, is AI slop given life—DNA run through an LLM, with a bulbous beluga noggin and an extra set of arms dangling under its body. “It's kind of like if the T-Rex was designed by H.R. Giger, and then that whole thing had sex with a Rancor,” director Gareth Edwards told Empire. While Rebirth does get dangerously close to showing dinosaur sex (which was in the script at one point, according to returning screenwriter David Koepp), Edwards' Hot Topic take on this beast lays bare its flaws. Undermining these would-be wonders with the promise of an even more bloated and warped CGI creature—one less comprehensible as an animal whose movements and actions inspire a relatable natural terror in its audience—zips past the metacommentary of the previous films' mutants and crashes headlong into irony. “You know, in the first movie I was struck by the irony that I'm writing a movie about greedy theme park people for…Universal, a profitable theme park company,” Koepp told IndieWire. The irony now exists in making a movie about a company who has strayed so far from their original specialty in order to innovate that they now seem intent on self-destruction. InGen's secret island lab, where bored scientists apparently tried to outdo each other by splicing critters who would make the least appealing toys, births not a particularly scary dinosaur, but a depressingly familiar movie monster. Overwhelming size and a jaws-first attack that activates our animal instincts. But in this context, a beefy alien-monster mishmash that simply grabs you with its regular arms isn't an escalation like it's intended to be—it's a reminder that what you're looking at through the majority of the film, dinosaurs for Christ's sake, are just an appetizer for a fast-food finale. That the climax of Jurassic World Rebirth is full of cop-outs and question marks makes this multi-legged Hell Knight from Doom even less effective. “When we first met, [Edwards] said, ‘If you come back to me with 10 different designs of a thing and at least six of them aren't ridiculous, you haven't gone far enough,'” said Rebirth visual effects supervisor David Vickery in the film's production notes. If ridiculous is the goal, why are you making a Jurassic Park movie? Nobody's complaint about the terrible Jurassic World trilogy was that the creatures didn't have enough arms, or were too easy to look at. If dinosaurs aren't good enough for your dinosaur movie, I have to question what we're all doing here in the first place. As now seems like tradition for the nearly self-aware sequels, always seeming like they're so close to getting it, a line of dialogue aptly describes how bad things have gotten. “Nobody cares about these animals anymore,” says the film's main dino scientist. If this current trend continues, the next Jurassic film will be a collaboration with SYFY.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During last year's Fourth of July, Kendrick Lamar set off more than fireworks when he released his now-ubiquitous video, “Not Like Us.” The seething retort against Drake not only rattled the 6 God and his disciples but unequivocally lunged Lamar into God mode. What followed was an unrelenting onslaught: a cinematic Super Bowl performance, a resounding Grammy sweep, and a 13-week Hot 100 triumph with “Luther.” Lamar's indomitable reign has only intensified in the months since courtesy of his Grand National Stadium Tour alongside SZA. Shady Nasty, Fred again.. and KETTAMA Join Forces for 'Air Maxes' This year's Fourth of July rang a little differently: Lamar's former lyrical combatant Drake entered the ring with ruthless intentions of his own, releasing “What Did I Miss?” After quietly piecing together a solid comeback campaign consisting of his chart-topping $ome $exy $ongs 4 U album with PARTYNEXTDOOR — as well as that set's breakout hit, the No. 2-climbing Hot 100 smash “NOKIA” — Drizzy could be masterminding his biggest heist yet: The Summer of Drake. And while we do have a platter of braggadocious bars being served this month in Clipse's Let God Sort Em Out, alongside a possible reunion between Freddie Gibbs and Alchemist for Alfredo 2, Lamar and Drake remain the genre's main characters. Now, with Drake firmly in album mode and gearing up for a historic three-day set at Wireless Festival beginning this Friday (July 11), the cards appear stacked in his favor. Sonically, “What Did I Miss?” is a solid rap return for Drake, who's otherwise spent the year entrenched in his R&B bag. Consider it a shootaround for the rapper: a volley of barbs, an entrancing beat-switch, and some biting shots against one of his former NBA homies. Upon its release, “What Did I Miss?” rocketed to the top of Spotify and Apple Charts. Whether it can secure a high debut on the Billboard charts in typical Drake fashion remains to be seen. Still, the rollout, complete with Drake blasting snippets from an Iceman rig truck all over Toronto — was pretty dope. Couple in his upcoming U.K. Tour with PND and the looming OVO Fest, Drake could be positioning himself for a strong return. Still, we can't dismiss Drake's hitmaking prowess and ability to shake the culture. Even after Lamar's drubbing, Drake snuck back into the conversation with “NOKIA,” which wasn't just a Billboard hit, but was an instant party starter and social media gem. Meanwhile, a song like “Somebody Loves Me” hasn't secured the Hot 100 spotlight like its predecessor, it's a song that continues to light up the social media scoreboard and nightclubs — and has been slowly climbing back up the chart for weeks after its initial debut and fade, re-entering the Hot 100's top half last week. Just like how Jay-Z ran the summers during his reign, it doesn't feel right when The Boy isn't clocking in from June to September. Maybe a little dose of Aubrey is what the game needs just about now.
