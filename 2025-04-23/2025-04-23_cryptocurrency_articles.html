Investors continued to buy risk assets on Wednesday, including growth stocks, tech stocks, and cryptocurrencies, following a sharp move higher on Tuesday. And as highly correlated assets, it's no surprise they're all up in unison today. The speculation today is that tariffs on imports from China will come down in short order after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expects a "de-escalation" in the trade war with China in the "very near future." But some of those concerns were alleviated today, at least according to the market's moves. If the trade war is indeed easing and the economy picks up later this year, it could be good for markets, including cryptocurrencies. What's notable about Bitcoin's move today is that it's correlated with growth and tech stocks, not a hedge against them. Gold, for contrast, is down 3.3% today and was up late last week and early this week when markets were crashing. Bitcoin itself doesn't appear to be an inflation hedge, market hedge, or a store of value in volatile markets. While Bitcoin has become a clear risk asset, Ethereum and Dogecoin have more questions around them as the market determines where crypto assets are going long term. Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin by a wide margin despite more utility for the blockchain built over the last few years. That's because Ethereum hasn't improved its speed or cost of transactions, as blockchains like Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) take market share because of their speed and low costs. Dogecoin is down over 50% since post-election highs and is still well below 2021 highs hit during the peak of the market frenzy. Dogecoin will continue to trade like a risk asset, but it's hard to see its fundamentals improving without a real use case for the token. I see moves like today's as another sign that the crypto market will continue to be extremely volatile and trade along with assets like growth stocks. But unlike growth stocks, there's less fundamental value behind these tokens. Bitcoin's argument for being a store of value hasn't proven to be true after falling after tariffs were announced earlier this month. And if inflation spikes, we will likely see Bitcoin fall again. Ethereum and Dogecoin continue to have mind share, but as developers and businesses are looking for more use cases for the blockchain they may lose favor. Today's move looks like a temporary bounce for Ethereum's and Dogecoin's declining fortunes long term. Cost basis and return based on previous market day close.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kyle Kemper, half-brother of former prime minister Justin Trudeau, is warning Canadians that Liberal Leader Mark Carney would push for a national central bank digital currency (CBDC). Kemper tells viewers a digital loonie would be “fully tracked, fully centralized” and could reward citizens for obedience while punishing dissent. “People don't understand how dangerous a CBDC is,” said Kemper. Kemper pointed out that President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order banning an American CBDC and argues Canada should do the same. Carney, sworn in as Liberal leader last month, has not responded publicly to Kemper's remarks. On the campaign trail this week, Carney emphasized the need for a modern payments system but has stopped short of committing to a timeline for any digital dollar. Central bank digital currencies are being tested or studied in more than 100 countries, including China and the European Union. The Bank of Canada continues internal research but says no decision will be made without public consultation and parliamentary approval. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has promised to block a CBDC if his party wins the federal election, saying it would give Ottawa too much control over personal finances. The CBDC issue adds a crypto controversy to an already volatile campaign defined by trade tensions and energy security.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cointelegraph speaks with James Check on why Bitcoin's future lies beyond four-year cycles, and how onchain data reveals what really matters. For years, crypto investors have looked to the four-year cycle, anchored around Bitcoin's halving events, as a kind of sacred roadmap. In an interview with Cointelegraph, Check said that the tidy frameworks that once defined Bitcoin's market behavior are no longer as useful in today's macro-driven, institutionally influenced environment. Rather than labeling the current market as “bull” or “bear,” Check paints a more nuanced picture. As such, the lines between bull and bear get blurry. “The world doesn't operate on four-year cycles,” he says. “You can imagine a headline tomorrow where suddenly all these tariffs get pulled back […] and markets start to move. Check also breaks down why the $70K–$75K range is such a critical confidence zone for the Bitcoin market — and how thinking in terms of scenarios rather than predictions is key for an investor's long-term success.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly $4 million in stolen cargo was   recovered by police in a case involving a South American crime ring  that looted coffee, tequila, shoes, body wash, pet food and bitcoin-mining computers. Police arrested Oscar David Borrero-Manchola, 41, and Yonaiker Rafael Martinez-Ramos, 26,  in the theft, sale and movement of stolen cargo, the Los Angeles Police Department announced in a news release. Crews of thieves who travel from Chile and other South American nations for the purpose of stealing jewels and luxury goods are not new in Los Angeles, authorities say, but such heists “are way, way up.” Borrero-Manchola was arrested April 15 and booked into a Van Nuys jail on suspicion of receiving stolen property. He was released on his own recognizance the following day, according to jail records. Martinez-Ramos was arrested Sunday on a no-bail warrant by Glendale police. The investigation remains active and more arrests could be announced, police said. South American theft groups, also called burglary tourists, have arrived in the country on tourist visas and then targeted wealthy enclaves across California in recent years, according to law enforcement. Four Colombian men were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary in May 2024 after a high-speed pursuit. In February, seven Chileans were charged with conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property after they allegedly broke in and stole valuables worth more than $2 million from the homes of professional athletes.

The second-largest crypto by market cap recently climbed past $1,800, staging a sharp rebound from its Apr. That earlier drop was partly triggered by market unease over President Trump's tariff-driven economic stance, which had weighed on risk assets. Since then, ETH has rallied more than 26%, breaking decisively out of the narrow $1,500 to $1,600 range where it had remained stuck for much of the month. As of April 23, Ethereum is trading near $1,790, gaining over 10% in just the past 24 hours. One whale recently borrowed $34.75 million in Tether (USDT) from Aave (AAVE) and used those funds to purchase nearly 20,000 ETH at an average entry of $1,740. As $ETH rebounded, a whale borrowed 34.75M $USDT from #Aave to buy 19,973 $ETH at ~$1,740 just 4 hours ago.This whale now collateralizes 50K $WETH ($89.8M) on #Aave to borrow 65.85M $USDT at a health rate of 1.12 and a liquidation price of $1,549.5.Follow @spotonchain and… pic.twitter.com/OBaDukqfAm The liquidation threshold for this position sits around $1,549, suggesting a carefully hedged bet built on short- to medium-term conviction. These inflows marked the highest single-day intake for Ethereum funds since early February and came after eight straight weeks of persistent outflows, which had totaled nearly $910 million. With both market structure and institutional behavior beginning to shift, let's examine what's happening across Ethereum's ecosystem, and where Ethereum price prediction could head in the coming days. 20, Buterin introduced the idea of replacing the Ethereum Virtual Machine with RISC-V, an open-source computing architecture known for its modularity and built-in encryption support. Popular ecosystems such as Coinbase's Base chain rely heavily on EVM standards to enable cross-chain operations and support developer migration. While the EVM has proven reliable, it is increasingly seen as a bottleneck for Ethereum's scalability. Adopting a more modern and adaptable architecture like RISC-V, according to Buterin, could enhance processing efficiency and reduce resource demands on the network. One of RISC-V's key strengths lies in its native support for encryption functions. RISC-V's built-in capabilities may offer a more direct and lightweight alternative. Buterin also pointed out that RISC-V has already shown promise in other blockchain environments, including small-scale implementations on platforms like Polkadot (DOT). In certain use cases, performance could improve by more than a hundredfold if Ethereum were to integrate RISC-V at the protocol level. These gains could help address persistent concerns over gas fees and network congestion, both of which remain barriers to everyday use and mainstream adoption. Ethereum's transaction volumes have declined, and ETH's price performance has lagged behind broader market trends. Despite this rebound, Ethereum is still trading below key long-term resistance levels. Both remain above the current price, signaling that ETH has yet to fully exit its broader downtrend and reclaim upward momentum on a longer time frame. The 5-day and 10-day moving averages have moved to $1,709 and $1,660, both now sitting below the current price, a typical early indicator of a bullish shift. The Relative Strength Index is hovering near 56.5, reflecting neutral territory, not yet in overbought or oversold conditions. This suggests there's still room for further price movement in either direction without immediate exhaustion. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), currently at 38, signals a neutral trend. It does not yet point to a strong directional shift, implying that market participants are still weighing macro cues and short-term signals. These thresholds will likely serve as key decision points for traders looking to determine whether the current move has lasting strength or is merely a temporary relief rally. Ethereum's recent bounce has sparked a wave of optimism, with several analysts suggesting that the recovery may finally be gaining structure. Both analysts are optimistic that Ethereum may be ready to climb, but only if short-term support stays intact. Meanwhile, Rekt Capital is approaching it from a broader lens, not price, but dominance. ETH dominance, which tracks Ethereum's market cap relative to the rest of crypto, recently hit new lows. But it's still holding above its 2019 base, and that matters. Another angle comes from Michaël van de Poppe, who sees a bullish divergence starting to take shape. A clear bullish divergence on $ETH signalling there's more to come.It breaks back in the lower timeframe range, indicating that we're having more in the tank.Level to hold: 1850 sats.If that holds and $ETH prints HLs, it's likely that we'll start an uptrend. Van de Poppe added that if Ethereum holds 1,850 sats against Bitcoin and starts to form higher lows, there's a good chance it could enter a fresh uptrend from here. Technical analysis can help identify potential shifts in sentiment, but charts don't account for sudden macro shocks. Whether ETH pushes higher or stalls again will depend on how the market handles upcoming resistance zones and whether confidence builds fast enough to carry it through.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cantor Fitzgerald, a leading global financial services firm, is partnering with SoftBank, Tether, and Bitfinex to build a Bitcoin acquisition vehicle. Read on as we explore the details of this deal and what it could mean for the broader crypto market. We'll also suggest three of the best altcoins you can buy to ride $BTC's potential rally. More About the Deal: Could it Help Push Bitcoin Above $100K? Cantor's partners are scheduled to convert their $BTC investments (1 $BTC at $85K) into 21 Capital shares, which will each have a face value of $10. The deal is still in its early stages, though, and there has been no official announcement yet. It's also worth noting that this isn't the first time Cantor has forayed into crypto. In November 2024, after the appointment of Trump as the president, plans emerged about a $BTC lending program with Tether that would allow people to borrow money with $BTC as collateral. Ever since Howard Lutnick stepped down from Cantor to join Trump's Commerce Department, the firm has been headed by Brandon and Kyle Lutnick (his sons) as Chairman and Executive VC. For the first time since March 2, 2025, Bitcoin has breached the $93K level after it rose by more than 6.8% on Tuesday, April 22. The king crypto jumped 1.56% within just one minute during this rally, from $91,969 to $93,405. Just a day earlier, more than $381.3M inflow was seen in the 11 US spot $BTC ETFs as well. Another analyst, ‘Ted,' believes that $BTC will eventually catch up with gold, which hit fresh lifetime highs only a few days ago. This comes after Trump said that the tariffs on China will eventually come down significantly and that he won't be removing Powell, the US Federal Reserve Chair. With institutional momentum building – and Bitcoin hitting new highs on the back of deals like Cantor's 21 Capital – the stage is set for another full-scale bull run. If you're looking for a meme coin that can mimic (and even surpass) Bitcoin's growth trajectory without requiring a huge upfront investment, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is the best crypto to buy now. Especially as $BTCBULL is the ONLY crypto that airdrops free $BTC to its token holders. Moreover, because these airdrops will take place every time Bitcoin smashes through a new milestone (like $150K, $200K, and $250K), we can expect BTC Bull Token to follow Bitcoin's coattails. What's more, the project's developers have planned to follow a deflationary approach, which will further push $BTCBULL's price. Essentially, a part of the total $BTCBULL supply will be wiped off every time Bitcoin climbs up by another $25K in price. This creates artificial scarcity for the token, which, combined with rising $BTC prices, could inflate $BTCBULL's demand – and lastly, its price. To better understand BTC Bull Token's potential, take a look at our $BTCBULL price prediction. Don't miss out on Bitcoin's biggest cheerleader and buy $BTCBULL today! Even better, each token is priced at just $0.002475, seeing as the project is in presale (where it has raised nearly $5M). Solaxy ($SOLX) – Top New Altcoin Building First-Ever Solana L2 A Bitcoin rally would add further fuel to the recent resurgence of meme coins. As a result, Solana's most anticipated listing, Solaxy ($SOLX), which aims to solve the network's congestion and scalability issues, could become the next crypto to explode. This will shoulder the burden on Solana's mainnet by offloading some of its transactions onto a sidechain. Furthermore, since $SOLX is compatible with both Ethereum and Solana (it's a multi-chain token), it will leverage the former's liquidity and the latter's speed to bring about the ultimate Solana revolution. One of the biggest reasons we've predicted Solaxy to gain over 12,000% and reach $0.20 by 2030 is its presale performance. Check out our guide on how to buy Solaxy for more information. Therefore, it's not only fair but also highly likely that his own meme coin, $TRUMP, is one of the biggest beneficiaries of a Bitcoin buying spree. $TRUMP is up over 17% in the last seven days, hinting at a reversal of sorts. The token is currently priced at just $9.40, with recent price action suggesting that a long rally might be in store. $TRUMP shot up by more than 12,000% overnight and became the fourth biggest meme coin by market capitalization in virtually seconds after its launch. Because of their high volatility (which is what gives them exploding potential, too, by the way), they can cause significant losses. That's why we urge our readers to do their own research before investing. Last but not least, please bear in mind that this article isn't financial advice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Bitcoin (BTC) has finally surpassed a key resistance that limited recovery rallies earlier this year, after rising over 5% to $93,500 in 24 hours. The leading digital asset by market value has topped the "Ichimoku Cloud," confirming a bullish shift in momentum, while other major cryptocurrencies lag. The Ichimoku cloud, developed by a Japanese journalist in the 1960s, is used to identify support and resistance, momentum, and trend change in price actions. The bullish breakout means the cloud can now act as support, arresting potential price pullbacks just as it acted as resistance, capping recovery rallies in February and March. BTC is also back to trading above the widely tracked 50-, 100-, and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs). This move now puts the focus on the resistance at $100K, a major psychological level, followed by record highs above $109K. Major altcoins such as payments-focused XRP, leading meme token DOGE, Cardano's ADA, Ethereum's native token ETH, and Solana's SOL are yet to chart a BTC-like bullish breakout above the Ichimoku cloud. The above coins, though buoyant alongside BTC's ascent, have yet to make their respective bullish breakouts. Omkar holds small amounts of bitcoin, ether, BitTorrent, tron and dot.</p>

Crypto firm Galaxy Digital is executing an asset swap involving the native tokens of layer-1 blockchains Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), according to on-chain data.

Data from blockchain tracking platform Lookonchain suggests that Galaxy Digital has, over the past two weeks, sold Ethereum worth tens of millions of dollars and purchased Solana.

“In the past two weeks, Galaxy Digital deposited 65,600 ETH ($105.48 million) to Binance and withdrew 752,240 SOL ($98.37 million) from Binance.”

Galaxy Digital's portfolio reorganization is coming amid the firm's head of research, Alex Thorn, predicting that the US will purchase Bitcoin (BTC) this year to add to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) launched in March. According to Thorn, one of the options the US could exercise to purchase the flagship crypto asset in a budget-neutral way would be to swap confiscated altcoins into Bitcoin.

“To be specific, you could sell an altcoin in an altcoin/BTC pair and never touch cash at all. No cash ever has to flow into the [US] general treasury. Could be an easier way to get to a ‘promises made, promises kept' on the SBR.”

Ethereum is trading at $1,630 at time of writing, down by 67% from the all-time high reached in November of 2021. Solana is changing hands at $140 at time of writing, down by 52% from the record high hit in January.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Backed by Tether and SoftBank Group, Twenty One is expected to launch with over 42,000 Bitcoin and a mission to maximize Bitcoin Ownership Per Share Co-founder Jack Mallers will lead Twenty One as CEO Twenty One is expected to offer investors a singular vehicle for Bitcoin exposure, pro-Bitcoin advocacy, and Bitcoin-focused content and media with plans to explore future expansion into Bitcoin-native financial products. AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Twenty One Capital, Inc. (“Twenty One” or “the Company”), a newly formed entity, today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement for a business combination with Cantor Equity Partners, Inc. (“CEP”) (Nasdaq: CEP) (the “Business Combination”), a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsored by an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald, a leading global financial services and real estate services holding company. At the closing of the Business Combination, Twenty One will be majority-owned by Tether, co-founder of Twenty One and the world's largest stablecoin issuer, and Bitfinex, with significant minority ownership by SoftBank Group Corp. (“SoftBank Group”), one of the world's leading investment holding companies. Twenty One and CEP have also entered into subscription agreements with investors to raise, at closing, $585 million of total additional capital consisting of (i) $385 million through convertible senior secured notes and (ii) $200 million through a common equity PIPE financing (the “PIPE Offerings”, and together with the Business Combination, the “Proposed Transactions”). Twenty One expects to launch with more than 42,000 Bitcoin, which would make it the third-largest Bitcoin treasury in the world as of today. Twenty One is built to accumulate Bitcoin and grow ownership per share, not just track it. As part of its launch, Twenty One will introduce two key performance metrics, to reflect its Bitcoin-denominated capital structure and Bitcoin-focused mindset. As the Founder and CEO of Strike, he has built one of the world's leading digital payment providers on Bitcoin's Lightning Network, pioneering Bitcoin brokerage infrastructure and Bitcoin's integration into corporate balance sheets. “We believe that Bitcoin is the answer, and Twenty One is how we bring that answer to public markets. Our mission is simple: to become the most successful company in Bitcoin, the most valuable financial opportunity of our time. “With Jack at the helm, we are proud to support this effort to further Bitcoin's adoption and reinforce its role as the ultimate store of value. At Tether, we have always believed in supporting initiatives that strengthen Bitcoin's dominance and real-world utility. Twenty One will take a Bitcoin-first approach that aligns with our vision—prioritizing accumulation over speculation and building long-term value for those who understand what Bitcoin represents.” Twenty One is structured to be a day one Bitcoin-native company that will strategically allocate capital to increase Bitcoin per share. Twenty One intends to develop a corporate architecture capable of supporting financial products built with and on Bitcoin. This includes native lending models, capital market instruments, and future innovations that will replace legacy financial tools with Bitcoin-aligned alternatives. As a pro-Bitcoin advocate, Twenty One plans to produce original Bitcoin-focused content and media. This pure-play approach will offer investors access to a public company that combines Bitcoin exposure with an operating business building Bitcoin-native products and services. “Cantor's relationships with innovative partners are key to unlocking unique opportunities, and we are proud of our role in this extraordinary collaboration between Tether, a foundation for today's digital asset ecosystem, and SoftBank, one of the world's preeminent investors,” said Brandon Lutnick, Chairman & CEO of Cantor Equity Partners, Inc. and Chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P. “With a visionary leader at the helm and backing from two renowned industry leaders, Twenty One is designed to help investors capture value from Bitcoin's growing global demand and increasing institutional adoption.” Twenty One will seek to trade after closing under the ticker symbol “XXI.” The transaction is expected to provide approximately $540 million in proceeds to Twenty One, including from a fully committed convertible senior secured notes PIPE of $385 million, convertible at $13.00 per share, a fully committed common equity PIPE of $200 million at $10.00 per share, and $100 million of cash held in the trust account of CEP, assuming no redemptions and prior to accounting for transaction expenses and interest accrued on the CEP trust account. Up to an additional $100 million of convertible senior secured notes may be purchased, at the investors' option (the “Convertible Notes Option”), within 30 days of the date hereof, which may generate additional proceeds. Tether has also agreed to purchase Bitcoin in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the convertible senior secured notes and equity PIPE offerings, less transaction expenses and certain other amounts, within 10 business days of the date hereof, plus additional Bitcoin to the extent investors elect to exercise their Convertible Notes Option. This Bitcoin will then be purchased by Twenty One upon closing using the proceeds of the PIPE offerings at a purchase price equal to the amount paid by Tether for such Bitcoin. Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. is acting as financial and capital markets advisor to CEP. Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP is acting as legal advisor to CEP. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom (UK) LLP is acting as legal advisor to Twenty One and Tether. Sullivan & Cromwell LLP is acting as legal advisor to SoftBank Group. Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. served as placement agent for the convertible senior secured note and common equity PIPE financings. At closing, Twenty One will become the first Bitcoin-native public company, built to maximize Bitcoin ownership per share. By leveraging cutting-edge blockchain and peer-to-peer technology, it is committed to bridging the gap between traditional financial systems and the potential of decentralized finance. The SoftBank Group is comprised of SoftBank Group Corp. (TOKYO: 9984), an investment holding company that includes stakes in AI, smart robotics, IoT, telecommunications, internet services, and clean energy technology providers, as well as a majority stake in Arm, which is building the future of computing; and the SoftBank Vision Funds, which are investing to help transform industries and shape new ones. Cantor Equity Partners (Nasdaq: CEP) is a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization, or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. The definitive proxy statement and other relevant documents will be mailed to shareholders of CEP as of a record date to be established for voting on the Proposed Transactions and other matters as described in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pump Fun co-founder Dylan Kerler has been linked to a number of shitcoin rugpulls that extracted $75,000 from unsuspecting investors when he was just 16. WIRED reportedly discovered that a developer using Dylan Kerler's name launched eight coins in 2017. Two of these, eBitcoinCash and EthereumCash, reportedly made the developer $75,000 in Ether (ETH), worth $400,000 today. They used EtherDelta to sell, making 240 ETH, before dividing it across various wallets on centralized exchanges. Certik's chief security scientist said, “We strongly suspect that [EthereumCash] was used by the developer for a rug pull.” Both coins were promoted by one person, using the accounts DOMAINBROKER and ninjagod. In one instance, DOMAINBROKER shared a personal email address with the name Dylan Kerler, while ninjagod launched a thread that referred to Kerler as the developer of EthereumCash. Pump Fun's co-founder is also listed on the electoral records as having an address in the area, and a Pump Fun entity uses this address in its corporate filings. A coin called Equis that was promoted by ninjagod on BitcoinTalk also shares identical code to EthereumCash and was featured on a YouTube account using Dylan Kerlar's name. Neither Pump Fun nor Kerler responded to WIRED's request for comment. Protos has reached out to Alon Cohen, Pump Fun's co-founder, for comment and will update this article if we hear anything back.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The non-fungible token (NFT) sector experienced explosive growth in 2021. Artists, investors, and collectors were all swept up in the frenzy. Yet, its meteoric rise was followed by a downturn, prompting questions about the sector's sustainability. In an exclusive interview with BeInCrypto, Salnikov offered his perspective on the state of NFTs in 2025 and their role moving forward. The rise of NFTs, fueled by excitement and speculation, was inevitable for a market experiencing such rapid innovation. Nonetheless, like many emerging technologies, this early surge was followed by a correction. According to the latest report by DappRadar, the art NFT market saw an impressive surge in 2021, with trading volumes reaching $2.9 billion. He emphasized the importance of a clear purpose when it comes to NFTs. But as more companies integrated the technology into everyday use cases, it became ingrained as a part of life,” he told BeInCrypto. Salnikov argued that trust quickly diminishes when NFTs are viewed merely as speculative assets. In contrast, projects rooted in real community engagement or providing tangible utility offer clear value, making their worth easily understood. Meanwhile, rather than viewing the sector's decline as a collapse, the executive sees it as a market recalibration, with the focus shifting away from speculative hype toward projects with more sustainable value. “The speculative phase had its moment, but now we're watching NFTs evolve into actual infrastructure—tools creators use to build communities, products, and new digital economies,” he said. He pointed to a growing convergence between the digital and physical worlds, with NFTs being tied to merchandise, events, and even real-world assets. Binance Research's April 2025 report further corroborates this trend. The report spotlighted several real-world partnerships, indicating interest in NFTs. “The next wave of growth isn't about chasing a trend—it's about unlocking new types of ownership and access that feel native to the internet generation,” noted Salnikov. While this perspective offers optimism, the reality for many companies is quite different. Those that didn't shut down explored alternative avenues. For instance, Magic Eden expanded beyond NFTs with the acquisition of Slingshot. “We're not trying to bolt on non-NFT features just to stay busy—we're building NFT commerce that actually fits the communities using it.” He explained that this approach uses modular, customizable on-chain marketplaces. Nonetheless, their investment strategies haven't fared particularly well. In January 2022, Bieber spent 500 ETH (approximately $1.3 million at the time) on Bored Ape #3001. This NFT is from Yuga Labs' Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection. Although the singer hasn't sold his NFT, it has received little attention lately, with no promotional efforts or notable discussions around it. As Salnikov pointed out, celebrity involvement in the sector is fleeting. “Celebrity drops will come and go—it's the culture behind them that determines if they stick,” he remarked. He argued that celebrities treating NFTs as mere merchandise deters audiences. Nevertheless, when an NFT drop is intentional and truly taps into something meaningful like music, fashion, or fandom, that's where the lasting value is found. “We're way more interested in working with creators who are building for the long haul than just chasing headlines,” Salnikov disclosed to BeInCrypto. He detailed that onboarding users should not feel “like a tech demo.” Salnikov pointed to Rarible as an example. According to him, Rarible focuses on ensuring that each marketplace built on its platform is a product people genuinely want to use. This involves features such as fiat onramps, low-cost mints, a clean user interface, and, most importantly, content that resonates with users. “We're not selling NFTs—we're powering experiences that just happen to be onchain,” Salnikov concluded. While the NFT market faces ongoing challenges, it remains to be seen whether the industry is entering a new phase of growth or if further obstacles lie ahead in its evolution.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A decision has yet to be made on whether to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the UK but the BoE, like many similar authorities worldwide, been exploring how to create what has been described as a ‘major national infrastructure project.' Despite its latest experimentation, offline payments continue to remain a head-scratcher for the authority's CBDC team. ‘This project demonstrated that while it might be technically feasible to implement an offline payment functionality for a digital pound, there are trade-offs, particularly around user experience and preventing double spending and counterfeiting, that make implementing it challenging,' the BoE states in its ‘Digital pound experiment report: Offline payments'. The BoE's latest experimentation involved work with five different private companies and explored four solutions. It demonstrated that ‘several' technology choices exist that could be made for offline payments but they are dependent on policy choices such as ‘risk appetite, product proposition and liability, which impact the options available for mitigating security risks,' the BoE summarises. RELATED ARTICLE No ‘one-size-fits-all' solution for offline CBDC payments: BIS handbook – a news article (11 May 2023) on a 119-page handbook produced by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub in partnership with Consult Hyperion (one of the companies engaged by the BoE for the experimentation this news article is about – see below) In its latest experimentation, the BoE worked with Thales, Secretarium, IDEMIA Secure Transactions, Quali-Sign and Consult Hyperion to assess different offline payment solutions. Thales UK had previously been awarded a contract, valued at £100,620 (about $134,000), from January 2023 to May 2023 to deliver a ‘CBDC Proof of Concept and Research of Offline Payments' (according to contract award notice published in April 2023 and previously reported by Global Government Fintech). Other approaches exist that could also be explored, the authority adds. The central bank points out that it explored offline payments from a technology perspective only. Other factors – such as policy, operational, legal (‘including but not limited, to the finality and irrevocability of payments from a legal perspective') and commercial considerations – will ‘need to be' explored, it continues, adding that ‘further work is required before design decisions can be made.' RELATED ARTICLE BoE publishes findings on point-of-sale testing for digital pound payments – a news story (2 June 2024) on experimentation testing the technical feasibility of using point-of-sale (POS) hardware, as currently used in the UK, for potential CBDC payments An 86-page BoE ‘Digital pound: technology working paper', published just over two years ago (February 2023), contained a section on considerations related to offline payments. ‘Online reconciliation was used as a fallback security measure in all four solutions to detect counterfeiting and double spending,' the report states. ‘Additional countermeasures had an impact on user experience and costs,' the report continues. ‘Measures such as risk mitigation limits had a negative impact on user experience since they prevented users from making further payments offline, often unexpectedly. There might also be financial inclusion impacts since more expensive, higher-end devices were needed to guarantee stronger security.' RELATED ARTICLE UK CBDC architects warned against creating ‘expensive infrastructure that no-one uses' – a report (21 March 2024) from a panel session titled ‘Stablecoins and CBDCs – what will be their impact on the payments industry?' The offline solutions assessed in this latest experimentation implemented different risk mitigation limits. The BoE reports, however, that ‘challenges […] arose when implementing those limits'. It explains: ‘For example, time-based limits were difficult to implement on the smart cards since those devices did not have an internal clock. But even on devices with an internal clock, for example smartphones, security concerns around trusting the clocks made time-based limits challenging to implement.' ‘We also observed potential user experience issues,' the BoE continues. ‘For example, we needed to consider how limits would be communicated to users and whether incoming or outgoing payments would be processed when the limits were reached. The report summarises the BoE's current perspective by stating that offline CBDC ‘would be an innovative feature with potential to support different policy goals, such as resilience or financial inclusion'. But it warns that ‘heavy reliance on secure elements meant that if the secure elements were breached, double spending and counterfeiting might occur.' ‘Secure elements are commonly used in payments today, but they are, in most cases, paired with immediate online authentication, thus limiting losses,' the central bank explains. ‘In contrast, the online layer in an offline payment (online reconciliation) occurs only after the transaction has taken place and losses have already been incurred.' ‘Our policy work on offline digital pound payments is ongoing,' the report concludes, adding that the central bank ‘expect[s] to conduct a policy assessment to determine what these findings might mean for a digital pound.' It also points out that other technical-related challenges exist that were not addressed in the project, such as what happens to offline funds if a user loses their device. The BoE kicked off 2025 on the CBDC front by reveals plans to create a ‘Digital Pound Lab' as a ‘technology sandbox environment [to] enable hands-on experimentation' through which it will test application programming interface (API) functionality, ‘innovative use cases', and potential business models for payment interface providers (PIPs) and external service interface providers (ESIPs).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With digital assets gaining legitimacy, there's growing strategic interest from major institutions, with regulation seen not as a barrier but as a catalyst for innovation. The U.S. government is moving away from a confrontational, enforcement-heavy stance on crypto and blockchain toward a more balanced regulatory posture, signaling support for compliance and innovation. As clearer frameworks emerge, there may be a split in the crypto space between companies that embrace regulation and those that operate outside it, with fewer operating in legal gray zones. The U.S. government's evolving approach to crypto regulation could mark a pivotal moment for payments innovation. “There's certainly a change in how the administration views the digital assets industry,” Dan Boyle, partner at Boies Schiller Flexner, told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster. Until recently, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) operated under what many in the industry perceived as a “regulation by prosecution” doctrine, aggressively pursuing high-profile crypto cases while offering little regulatory guidance. But the DOJ's recent decision to pivot away from that stance, paired with growing bipartisan support for proposed frameworks for stablecoin regulation, signals a reimagining of how Washington approaches cryptocurrency oversight. “This shouldn't be seen as a get out of jail free card. It's just a change in posture and market participants have to recognize that,” he said. Rather, it's a pragmatic acknowledgment that blanket hostility doesn't help to foster compliance or innovation. In other words, when it comes to cryptocurrency, sunlight may be the best disinfectant. Crypto's global reach has created a cat-and-mouse game between innovation and illicit activity. While enforcement risk remains, the GENIUS Act has emerged as a beacon of hope for crypto firms seeking clarity. If passed, it would be the first comprehensive U.S. framework for regulating stablecoins, a digital asset class often used as an off-ramp for criminal funds but increasingly embraced by mainstream financial institutions. It's a hard argument for Congress to ignore,” Boyle said. That means preparing for scrutiny around transactions linked to Venezuela, Iran or known cartels. It also means considering proactive disclosure if risky activity is detected. “When you look at how the prior administration just kind of viewed [crypto] as an area that wasn't particularly compliant … now there's going to be a lot of freedom to develop new technology,” he said. “There's some strategic value to being a world leader in digital assets … If my competitor is issuing a stablecoin or tokenizing assets, am I missing out if I don't?” Still, the future could hinge on one crucial thing: defining what digital assets even are. Boyle agreed, adding that, “even now, whatever definition we might come up with today, that may be obsolete in three to six months … Perhaps having more participants in the area is going to help us all understand what the scope of the category should be.” Ultimately, for companies navigating crypto's uncertain terrain, Boyle offered these final words of advice: don't let your guard down, but don't sit it out. “And there's a lane now for companies who want to do it right.” We're always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On February 27, 2025, the US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Division of Corporation Finance issued a staff statement (the Statement) clarifying that “meme coins” will generally not be classified as securities under federal law. Although staff statements are not official rules or regulations, this announcement signals a potential shift in the SEC's approach to the regulation of celebrity-endorsed crypto asset ventures, which often involve the endorsement of meme coins. Celebrity-endorsed crypto asset ventures promise significant returns through leveraging the influence of well-known figures to attract investors. Such endorsements have proven to be an effective means to enhance the credibility of crypto assets, but had previously captured the SEC's attention given concerns of celebrities and social media influencers promoting crypto asset offerings that are not compliant with existing securities laws. Scrutiny increased in light of the collapse of FTX Trading Ltd. — a once $32 billion dollar2 crypto asset exchange that was endorsed by several high-profile celebrities as a secure investment platform — due to financial mismanagement and the misappropriation of customer funds.3 The implications of celebrity endorsements are especially significant given the emergence of young investors who increasingly turn to social media to discover and validate investment opportunities.4 The SEC has historically taken a decisive stance on the application of anti-touting laws (which make it unlawful to promote a security for compensation without fully disclosing the receipt and amount of such compensation) with respect to celebrity-endorsed crypto assets. In 2017, following a surge of celebrities promoting investments in initial coin offerings (ICOs), the SEC issued a statement urging caution around celebrity-backed ICOs, warning that such offerings could involve the issuance or distribution of securities which require compliance with federal laws. It reaffirmed the requirement for persons making endorsements of investments in ICOs to disclose compensation received for the endorsements. More particularly, Section 17(b) of the US Securities Act5 makes it unlawful for any person to “publish, give publicity to, or circulate any […] communication which […] describes such security for a consideration […] from an issuer, underwriter, or dealer, without fully disclosing the receipt, whether past or prospective, of such consideration and the amount thereof.” By requiring such disclosure, Section 17(b) aims to safeguard the public from marketing or promotional activities (including social media posts) that claim to offer impartial opinions but are actually influenced by payments. Similarly, social media marketing of financial services caught the eye of the US Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). In September 2021, FINRA launched a targeted examination seeking to examine how firms found, contracted, and compensated social media influencers to promote their products and services (e.g., referral programs).6 In November 2022, FINRA also launched a targeted exam to review the practices of firms actively communicating with retail customers concerning crypto assets.7 In its update on the 2022 Sweep, FINRA noted having identified potential substantive violations of FINRA Rule 2210 in approximately 70 percent of the over 500 crypto-asset-related retail communication reviewed.8 Namely, FINRA observed false claims about the nature of crypto assets, misleading comparisons and explanations, omissions of key details, and misrepresentations about legal protections and coverage. However, given the current US administration's evolving policy on crypto asset regulation, it is unclear whether FINRA will continue to maintain the same level of scrutiny on social media marketing of financial services. Nonetheless, concerns regarding social media promotion have been on the Canadian Securities Administrators' (CSA) radar. In November 2018, the CSA released Staff Notice 51-356 – Problematic promotional activities by issuers, which served to caution issuers against engaging in promotional activities that could artificially inflate an issuer's share price and trading volume, or otherwise mislead investors. Such promotional activities, according to the CSA, include compensating third parties who utilize social media to promote issuers without disclosing their agency, compensation, and/or financial interest. In September 2021, the CSA and the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) jointly issued Staff Notice 21-330 – Guidance for Crypto-Trading Platforms – Requirements relating to Advertising, Marketing and Social Media Use (SN 21-330), which addressed deceptive advertising practices by crypto asset trading platforms (CTPs) and third parties acting on their behalf. SN 21-330 expressed concern with CTPs' use of marketing tactics like contests, promotions, and time-limited offers to prompt quick trading, which could lead investors to take on excessive risks. The Ontario Securities Commission has also taken steps to address third-party marketing partnerships through Staff Notice 33-755 – Summary Report for Dealers, Advisors and Investment Fund Managers (SN 33-755), where it noted the requirement for issuers to establish measures to monitor and oversee their arrangements with marketing partners (i.e., corporations or individual bloggers/influencers with an established online audience or following) and to verify that statements made about the firm's products and services are fair, substantiated, and not misleading. In particular, SN 33-755 noted that registered firms should provide sufficient disclosure to make clients aware of the arrangement between the firm and the marketing partner and any associated conflicts of interest, including compensation paid to the marketing partner. The British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC) has also been active in regulating promotional activities lacking appropriate disclosure. Although the Proposed Instrument is not yet in effect, the BCSC has actively addressed undisclosed online paid promotional activities by relying on existing provisions of the Securities Act (British Columbia), specifically Section 52(2) which provides as follows:9 52(2) A person engaged in investor relations activities, and an issuer or security holder on whose behalf investor relations activities are undertaken, must ensure that every record disseminated, as part of the investor relations activities, by the person engaged in those activities clearly and conspicuously discloses that the record is issued by or on behalf of the issuer or security holder. For example, in January 2023, the BCSC found in Re Stock Social Inc.,10that investor relations records must “clearly and conspicuously” disclose if they are disseminated by or on behalf of an issuer or security holder under Section 52(2). The panel noted that the obligation applies to promotional and marketing materials, including social media posts by influencers and is binding on issuers and those disseminating the promotional advertisements in British Columbia. Celebrity and influencer involvement in ICOs and retail investments has evolved beyond merely receiving undisclosed payments for promotions. Given their ability to leverage their influence on social media platforms, celebrities and influencers are well-equipped to engage in market manipulation by artificially inflating or deflating asset prices, which would be considered non-compliant with Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 193411 and Rule 10b-512  thereunder. These provisions prohibit any individual from directly or indirectly employing any means to defraud, making false statements, omitting pertinent information, or otherwise engaging in business practices that would deceive another party during securities transactions. For instance, the SEC charged Ishan Wahi, his brother, and a close friend with insider trading in crypto assets, violating Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. Wahi, a manager at Coinbase Global, Inc., was reportedly part of a “tight circle” that was entrusted with knowledge of which crypto asset securities would be listed on Coinbase's exchange, as well as the anticipated timing of such listings. A token being listed on an exchange or marketplace can have a material effect on its price.13 The SEC accused Wahi, his brother, and his friend of trading ahead of announcements. The brothers settled the insider trading charges by agreeing to permanent injunctions against violating securities laws, paying disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and serving prison time.14 For example, Section 126.1 of the Securities Act (Ontario) provides that it is prohibited to engage, or attempt to engage, in any conduct related to securities or derivatives that creates a misleading appearance of trading activity or an artificial price, or that perpetrates fraud.15 Section 126.2 also provides that making materially misleading or untrue statements that could significantly affect the market price or value of a security or derivative is prohibited.16 Insider trading is addressed separately; in Ontario, prohibitions are contained in the Section 76(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), which provides that no person or company in a special relationship with an issuer can trade securities of the issuer or disclose material facts or changes about the issuer that have not been generally disclosed.17 Although these provisions apply to social media influencers engaged in market manipulation and insider trading schemes, Canadian provincial regulators have yet to pursue cases analogous to those handled by the SEC. Nonetheless, the CSA has recently commented on the existing framework surrounding market manipulation and insider trading in the context of evolving technologies, indicating a readiness to address similar issues involving crypto assets.18 The SEC's Statement has introduced ambiguity into the regulatory landscape surrounding celebrity-endorsed crypto assets, particularly meme coins. As outlined above, regulatory actions in this area have historically relied on securities-related legislation. However, the SEC's clarification that meme coins generally do not constitute securities under federal law challenges this approach. This raises broader questions about how authorities might regulate the influence of celebrities in the crypto asset space beyond meme coin ventures, especially as their endorsements continue to significantly impact investor behaviour. In Canada, the classification of meme coins as securities remains unresolved, and there is a limited track record of regulatory action concerning celebrity-endorsed crypto asset ventures. While Canadian regulators are increasingly vigilant about the potential risks posed by undisclosed promotional activities, particularly in the realm of social media and digital marketing, the SEC's stance adds further uncertainty to the approach that Canadian regulators might adopt in this realm.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yuga Labs Demands $400K in Influencer's Crypto Wallets Over NFT Lawsuit Yuga Labs has filed a turnover order in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, in an effort to seize crypto assets held by influencer Jeremy Cahen, also known online as Pauly0x. Yuga Labs sued Cahen and artist Ryder Ripps in July 2022 for infringing on Yuga Labs' trademark through the sale of the Ryder Ripps Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection. Ripps had launched the copycat project in May 2022 as a form of “parody” and protest, claiming Bored Ape NFTs featured hidden Nazi and racist imagery. The final judgment, entered on February 2, 2024, became enforceable by March 3. Cahen has not posted a bond or obtained a stay of enforcement, which has allowed Yuga Labs to begin post-judgment asset recovery. “Yuga Labs has taken affirmative steps under California law, essentially every month since the Court issued its Final Judgment to locate and execute upon Cahen's assets," the company said in its most recent filing. "Still, Cahen has made a mockery of this Court's Final Judgement by refusing to pay any portion of the judgment or comply with any post-judgment discovery.” According to Yuga, this transfer occurred one day after the levy was issued—before Gemini could freeze his accounts—suggesting a deliberate effort to evade asset seizure. Gemini, in response to a subpoena, provided transaction records from Cahen's account, showing that he moved crypto into two new wallets. Cahen, who has promoted various meme coins and been accused of being a scammer, branded himself “the most censored man on X” following the suspension of his account last year. Puerto Rican authorities confirmed in February that Cahen is wanted for aggravated assault. The court has not yet ruled on Yuga Labs' turnover motion.
