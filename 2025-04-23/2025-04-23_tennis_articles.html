                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Teenage sensation Joao Fonseca has taken the tennis world by storm this season. The Brazilian took out a top-10 seed on his Grand Slam debut and followed it up by winning his first title in Buenos Aires. Now, he's eyeing a showdown with Novak Djokovic. 65 has already put himself on Djokovic's radar. The 24-time Grand Slam champion has lauded praise on Fonseca and his rise. But, while other up-and-comers would rather avoid Djokovic at the biggest tournaments, Fonseca is all-in on a blockbuster first-round meeting at the French Open. The 18-year-old qualified for his first Grand Slam main draw at the Australian Open back in January and stunned No. A few weeks later, Fonseca claimed his first ATP Tour title at the Argentina Open, and he's also collected two Challenger trophies this season. The Brazilian hit a career-high ranking of No. 59 earlier this year and now sits at No. 65, meaning he can claim direct entry into the Grand Slam tournaments, including next month's French Open. Fonseca is hoping for another huge test in his next Major appearance, facing Djokovic. Just in    Rafa Nadal 'surprised' Andy Murray wants to coach Novak Djokovic for one reason You can check out at any time. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. “I'd love to face Djokovic first, second round. Djokovic has 24 Major trophies under his belt, three of which came at the French Open, and plenty of players wouldn't want to face him early in one of the biggest tournaments. Some players will want to play ‘easier' first, but I want to play the iconic ones.” Djokovic would also likely relish a chance to play the 18-year-old while their paths can still cross. During last month's Miami Open, the tennis legend admitted he'd been impressed with Fonseca. Just incredible firepower from both ends of the baseline, serve. He faces another young star, qualifier Elmer Moller, in the first round on Thursday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>16 first round matches are scheduled on Day 2 of the ATP Mutua Madrid Open. Lots of exciting matches to look forward to for the fans including the match between Nicolas Jarry and Daniel Altmaier. He is playing in Madrid for the first time and will like his chances to make a winning start. Damir Dzumhur is an experienced campaigner and has been in good form recently. Both players are extremely close in rankings and I expect a tight contest. However, I still like Luciano Darderi's chances better in this match as he is the more natural on this surface and has played some fantastic tennis in the last month. Zizou Bergs is enjoying the best season of his career and has been super consistent. He has only played 19 main draw matches on clay but his game style is well suited for the surface. Yoshihito Nishioka will play his first match on ckay this season and would be the heavy underdog going into this match. Nishioka's serve will also be under pressure all match. Jarry is going through a rough patch since the French Open last year and is on a five match losing streak. However, he has shown some glimpses of better tennis recently and will look to play a solid match. Altmaier has done a lot of winning this year including the two wins in qualifying. First-round ATP Masters action in Madrid will feature the return of Brazilian prodigy Joao Fonseca. The 18-year-old kicks off his European clay court journey in Iga Swiatek faces a rematch from the Miami Open Madison Keys is one of three Grand Slam champions kicking off their WTA Madrid Open campaign on Thursday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As ever, we at LWOT preview and predict the matches scheduled for you. Marcos Giron is higher ranked and he would feel good about his chances against Learner Tien who will find it tough to hit through on the slow courts in Madrid. Expect Giron to be more aggressive and get the win. It will be interesting to see how well Tallon Griekspoor plays this week as he has built good momentum on the clay courts this year. He now faces Vit Kopriva who hasn't played much on the main tour and will find it tough to go toe to toe with the quality of Griekspoor. Tomas Martin Etcheverry hasn't had the European clay court swing he would have liked so far and his first round this week is a tricky one. He takes on Hamad Medjedovic who has had good results in the past month or so and the young Serb will look to capitalise on that. The Dutchman will look to take full toll of Struff's lack of confidence and the clay courts will enable Zandschulp to do so. 16 first round matches are scheduled on Day 2 of the ATP Mutua Madrid Open. First-round ATP Masters action in Madrid will feature the return of Brazilian prodigy Joao Fonseca. Madison Keys is one of three Grand Slam champions kicking off their WTA Madrid Open campaign on Thursday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a new Netflix documentary, "Carlos Alcaraz: My Way", the Spaniard describes how he went against the advice of his team to let his hair down on the Mediterranean island. "I had a friend who had a few days off, going to Ibiza with other friends," the now four-time Grand Slam champion said. "I basically went there to reventar (literally, 'burst' in Spanish), I'm not sure if that's the best way to put it but I went there to go out." It might not have been textbook preparation for Wimbledon, and his agent Albert Molina warned against it, but Alcaraz said he had to let off steam after losing to Novak Djokovic in the 2023 French Open semis having suffered with nerves and cramps. Ibiza's tonic paid off spectacularly too, as a few weeks later, aged 20, he beat the Serb in the Wimbledon final. Alcaraz repeated the trick in 2024 with another Ibiza trip before the grass-court season with his fitness coach Juanjo Moreno accusing him of being selfish. "He has a different way of understanding work and sacrifice," Ferrero said, comparing him to Djokovic. "It's so different that it makes me question whether he can really be the best in history." "I don't take care of myself as much, I spend a lot of days enjoying life. "But I want to do it my way." Alcaraz, who will be 22 next month, is second seed at this week's Madrid Masters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aryna Sabalenka and Carlos Alcaraz will both be hoping to get their hands on the Madrid Open title again. Sabalenka lost to Jelena Ostapenko last week in the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix final, as she finished runner-up in Stuttgart for a fourth time. Alcaraz suffered an injury scare in Barcelona, leaving his participation at the 2025 Madrid Open is now in doubt. Now Sabalenka has taken a different stance to Alcaraz on Masters 1000 tournaments like the Madrid Open. Last week en route to Barcelona Open final, Alcaraz was asked about two Masters 1000 tournaments. The week prior Alcaraz had won the Monte Carlo Masters, which took place over just one week, something that is becoming more of a rarity on both the ATP and WTA Tours. Some will think that in two weeks there are days of rest, but that is not the case. Suggesting that they may have different approaches to these events, Sabalenka has now given her verdict on these tournaments and revealed that she actually  prefers two week tournaments. “I prefer two-week tournaments because having a day off between matches allows you to relax more, go out to dinner with your team, and explore the city,” Sabalenka said in her pre-Madrid Open press conference. “Maybe in a few years I won't be so interested in that and prefer to spend more time at home, but right now, that's my mentality.” While Sabalenka is currently in favor of them, Alcaraz is not on his own in people who have criticised two week Masters 1000 tournaments.</p>

Former tennis world No 1 Andre Agassi will make his professional debut in the fast-growing sport of pickelball next week when he teams up with top ranked Anna Leigh Waters for the mixed doubles at the US Open Pickleball Championships.

Invented in 1965 by a group of American friends, pickleball is a fast-paced paddle sport similar to tennis and badminton played on smaller courts using a perforated plastic ball, and interest has skyrocketed in recent years.

Waters, 18, is the Professional Pickleball Association's top-ranked player in the world for singles, doubles and mixed doubles and Agassi said he would probably weigh her down.

“She's probably sick of winning so much, and that's why she called me and asked me to play,” Agassi, who won eight tennis grand slams among his 60 ATP Tour-level titles, told CNBC on Tuesday.

The 54-year-old added that he did not see him joining the growing ranks of pro pickeball players after the tournament, which takes place in Naples, Florida.

“If I had the luxury of bandwidth to focus all my energy on just playing and body recovery and all that stuff, that would be a joy. But I don't. I'm in a different season now,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis legend Andre Agassi will make his pro pickleball debut at the US Open Championships in Naples. The tournament is set to run from April 26-May 3 at East Naples Community Park. 1-ranked tennis player and winner of the sport's Grand Slam, will partner with Anna Leigh Waters, the top-ranked women's player in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Here is more to know about Andre Agassi, one of the most iconic tennis players in the sport's history. Agassi was born on April 29, 1970 in Las Vegas, which means he is 54 years old. When he was 13, Agassi started training at Nick Bollettieri's tennis academy in Bradenton. He made his professional debut as a 16-year-old in 1986 and won his first major in 1992 when he defeated Groan Ivanisevic at Wimbledon. Agassi has been married to former women's tennis great Steffi Graf since 2001. The tennis power couple first met following Agassi's Wimbledon victory in 1992. Waters, who lives in Boynton Beach, has since won 148 gold medals and earned an estimated $3 million per year from endorsements and sponsorships in 2024, according to Forbes, making her the highest-paid pickleball player in the world.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The city of Abidjan bustles with more than six million people. Energy can be felt through its streets and the city's size is impossible to ignore. Now that same vibrancy is intersecting with tennis as the Côte d'Ivoire becomes the 95th country to host an ATP Challenger Tour event. It marks another step forward for tennis in Africa, following Rwanda's debut last season and its second edition earlier this year. Brazzaville, Republic of Congo has also hosted this year and in 2024. It doesn't look like a tennis match, more so football because tennis is not very popular in Côte d'Ivoire,” said tournament director Arzel Mevellec. “People like to attend something new, so that's good. Abidjan, one of West Africa's key economic capitals, is located along the Gulf of Guinea on the Atlantic coast. The ATP Challenger Tour's expansion into the Côte d'Ivoire's former capital city is part of a larger effort to develop tennis across Africa. The Frenchman Mevellec is playing a key part, directing not only the Abidjan event, but also in Kigali, Rwanda and Brazzaville, as well as spearheading the Quimper Challenger in his home country. In Africa, they have one million players for the continent. In France, you cannot organise a tournament with no connections to clubs, for example. While Abidjan is taking a step forward as the next African city to host, it is part of the staircase leading to what could come next. “The idea is to develop a tour in Africa, so that means we hope to have four or five weeks in a row on the west coast of the continent,” Mevellec said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alcaraz has faced some harsh scrutiny this season, particularly during a mixed run of results prior to the clay-court season. The world No 3 has amassed a strong 24-5 (82.8%) record across the seven tournaments he has played so far in 2025. Alcaraz was also a semi-finalist in Indian Wells and a quarter-finalist at both the Australian Open and the Qatar Open, while he lost his opening match at the Miami Open. The Spanish star has won 18 titles, including four Grand Slams and six Masters 1000 events, in his outstanding career to date. “No, I don't understand it,” the Serbian told Eurosport Spain. “But the atmosphere and tradition of tennis in this country is very high. You want more, but what he's done in this period is incredible.” ATP Rankings: How many points are Sinner, Zverev, Alcaraz, Djokovic, Rublev dropping in Madrid? Boris Becker claims tennis ‘needs' both Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz Alcaraz, the No 2 seed, will play either Zizou Bergs or Yoshihito Nishioka in his first match in Madrid. Djokovic, who is seeded fourth, will take on Matteo Arnaldi or Borna Coric. In an interview with GQ earlier this year, Djokovic addressed Alcaraz's achievements and the ambitious statements he has made. He is going to complete his [career] Slam very soon,” the 24-time major winner said. He wants to be ‘the best in history.' But maybe it's a little bit early for him to think about history.” READ NEXT: Carlos Alcaraz leaves former world No 2 feeling ‘uneasy' ahead of Madrid Open "On the tennis court, there wasn't that much difference between us, but in this I'm much better than them." Andrey Rublev and Felix Auger-Aliassime were the 2024 Madrid Open finalists so have a lot of points to defend. The five-time Madrid Open champion has given his verdict ahead of this year's event.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Defending champion Andrey Rublev is in danger of slipping down the ATP Rankings after the Madrid Open while Lorenzo Musetti is in line to make his top-10 debut. Rublev lifted his second ATP Masters trophy last year when he defeated Felix Auger-Aliassime in the final, earning 1,000 ranking points in the process that helped him to solidify his position in the top 10. But that 1,000 points will drop from his overall tally this week and he has dropped nine places to No 17, but, of course, he can still make up ground over the next fortnight with a run to the latter stages of the tournament. The Madrid Open is a 96-player singles draw event and all 32 seeds receive byes into the second round, which means they earn 10 points without lifting a racket. So there is a bit of good news for Rublev as he is -990 ahead of his second-round match while Auger-Aliassime is -640, although the Canadian has dropped seven places in the Live Rankings to No 26. World No 1 Jannik Sinner will, of course, not be in action at the Madrid Open as it is the last tournament he will miss due to his three-month suspension, but he will still drop 200 points after reaching the quarters last year. The three-time Grand Slam winner will be back at the Italian Open in May. Alexander Zverev is the top seed and it's an event where he can make up ground on Sinner and possibly put a gap between himself and third-placed Carlos Alcaraz. The German is only defending 100 points from his third-round defeat in 2024 while Alcaraz, who was the two-time defending champion last year, lost in the quarter-final and will drop 200 points (190 when his 10 points for his bye are added). Carlos Alcaraz injury ‘decision made' ahead of Madrid Masters opener – report Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz to crash out as Alexander Zverev fights back – Madrid Open predictions Taylor Fritz lost in the last four against Rublev and so will drop 400 points, but remains at No 4 in the Live Rankings while Jiri Lehecka was the other semi-finalist and he has slipped 10 places to No 37. Daniil Medvedev and Francisco Cerundolo joined Sinner and Alcaraz in exiting at the quarter-final stage so they will effectively be -190. Novak Djokovic and Jack Draper are the biggest “winners” in the top 10 as they the former didn't compete last year so he won't drop any points while Draper is defending only 30 points. Lorenzo Musetti is currently at a career-high No 11 in the official rankings, but he has climbed two places to No 9 in the Live Rankings as he lost in the second round last year. Instead, points for his 19th best result will be deducted so he will drop 50 points before another 10 is added for his bye. Jannik Sinner – 9,730 points 2. Alex de Minaur – 3,454 8. The likes of Djokovic, Draper, De Minaur and newly-crowned Barcelona Open winner Holger Rune could receive nice ranking boosts if they enjoy runs to the latter stages at the Madrid Open. Novak Djokovic has sent a clear message to Carlos Alcaraz's critics. "On the tennis court, there wasn't that much difference between us, but in this I'm much better than them." Carlos Alcaraz may be forced to pull out of the Madrid Open, according to a report in Spain. Rafael Nadal is "sure" Jannik Sinner is "an innocent and moral person." © Planet Sport Limited 2025 • All Rights Reserved</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz has become the prince of Wimbledon. Aged just 21, the Spaniard lifted the title two years in a row, beating Novak Djokovic in both finals. But even two-time champions aren't exempt from the All England Club's strict rules. Players must compete in an all-white kit when playing on the club's hallowed courts. And Alcaraz learned that the hard way, when he was told off and warned that he wouldn't be allowed to play his next match if a banned colour was on show. It was a year of highs and lows - Alcaraz suffered heartbreak in the Olympic gold medal match and lost early at the US Open. Alcaraz let the Netflix cameras follow him during his title defence at SW19 last summer, and he revealed that he got into some trouble at the All England Club. The four-time Grand Slam champion loves Wimbledon's history and tradition, though he has fallen foul of the stringent rules himself. Remembering his own past experience, Alcaraz added: “I was wearing colour briefs and you could see them through my shorts, and they called me out on them, saying, ‘Next time, we won't let you play.' “I mean, this really goes to show you just how strict they can be!” 3 has since learned to play by the rules at Wimbledon and become a dominant force at the tournament. Then, a year later, Alcaraz dominated in a replay of the championship match, winning in straight sets. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. Not once did I let him trip me up.” Things got tricky when Alcaraz blew three championship points when serving for the title but he managed to get the job done in a tiebreak. The Spaniard will return to SW19 this summer looking for a hat-trick of trophies. His last loss at Wimbledon came in 2022, when he reached the fourth round and was beaten by Jannik Sinner.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rafael Nadal enjoyed a legendary tennis career, winning 22 Grand Slam titles during his time on tour. Two years after his final Roland Garros triumph in 2022, Nadal retired from tennis when Spain were knocked out of the 2024 Davis Cup Finals. Speaking in an interview ahead of the 2025 Madrid Open, Roberto Bautista Agut shared his thoughts on Nadal. “Rafa [Nadal] is missed a lot on the circuit,” he said. Alcaraz and Nadal are two of three Spanish players to have won multiple men's Grand Slam titles during the Open Era. Bautista Agut may never have beaten Nadal or Alcaraz, but that's not to say he hasn't scored some big wins over the years. The world number 55 hadn't qualified for a Major quarterfinal before 2019, when he embarked on an impressive Grand Slam campaign. Bautista Agut knocked out Andy Murray, John Millman, Karen Khachanov, and Marin Cilic on his way to the Australian Open quarterfinals in January. There, he lost to Greek star Stefanos Tsitsipas in four sets, learning some valuable lessons ahead of his next deep Grand Slam run. “I had planned to be in Ibiza right now,” he said. Well, it feels better to be here in London.” Bautista Agut's Cinderella run came to an end in the semi-finals as he fell to defeat against eventual champion Novak Djokovic in four sets, 2-6, 6-4, 3-6, 2-6. Bautista Agut will return to action at the Madrid Open, where he'll take on his fellow Spaniard Jaume Munar on Wednesday, April 23.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bolavip, like Futbol Sites, is a company owned by Better Collective. Born on June 8, 1997, in Riga, Latvia, Jelena Ostapenko's journey to tennis stardom began early. She turned professional in 2012 but truly announced herself in 2017 when she shocked the world by winning Roland Garros, defeating then-world No. That stunning victory marked her as one to watch, though her career since has been marked by both highs and lows. In 2025, however, Ostapenko has found her groove, delivering standout performances throughout the season. Known for her fiery personality, Ostapenko has faced her share of controversies, including clashes with other players, such as a heated exchange with Elena Rybakina in Rome. Her three-set victory over Simona Halep (3-6, 6-4, 6-3) remains a watershed moment. Reflecting on that time, Ostapenko admitted, “My life changed when I won in Paris. Winner, Jelena Ostapenko of Latvia and Runner up, Simona Halep of Romania hold their trophies following the 2017 Roland Garros final. After her 2017 triumph, injuries and inconsistency hampered Ostapenko's progress. She struggled to maintain her form and went title-less in 2018. But by 2019, she was back, claiming the Eastbourne title on grass—a testament to her resilience. Paris 2024 medalist retires at 28 due to mental health issues, receives huge support from Carlos Alcaraz Ostapenko has never shied away from confrontation, earning a reputation as one of the WTA Tour's most polarizing figures. In 2024, she famously refused to shake hands with Victoria Azarenka after a match, with reports suggesting lingering tension between the two. In 2021, she clashed with Ajla Tomljanović, accusing her opponent of feigning an injury during a match. Her infamous outburst against Elena Rybakina in 2023, where she reportedly insulted her at the net, remains one of the circuit's most talked-about incidents. Ostapenko made headlines at the 2023 US Open when she demanded the removal of a disruptive fan during her third-round match against Bernarda Pera. Explaining her actions, she said, “He started yelling like crazy while I was serving. I told him to leave, and he did.” The Latvian boasts a perfect 6-0 record against Swiatek, with her latest victory coming in Stuttgart. Ostapenko's Stuttgart performance was nothing short of extraordinary. She first took down Swiatek, the world No. 2, then cruised past Aleksandrova, and capped it off with a dominant win over Sabalenka, the top-ranked player, in the final. With this run, Ostapenko achieved a feat not seen since Serena Williams—defeating the world's top two players en route to a WTA clay-court championship. With her Stuttgart win, Ostapenko reached another milestone. She became the first woman since Serena Williams to win at least one WTA title on all major surfaces—outdoor clay, indoor clay, outdoor hard, indoor hard, and grass. She joins Petra Kvitová as the only other player to achieve this feat in singles.
