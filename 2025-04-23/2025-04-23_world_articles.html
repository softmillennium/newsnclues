                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Experts have said that Israel's withholding and targeting of humanitarian aid amount to genocidal acts. Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and top Republican leaders at Mar-a-Lago agreed in a meeting that Israel should continue bombing humanitarian aid in Gaza, Ben-Gvir has said — effectively admitting that he is getting express support from top U.S. leaders to commit what experts have deemed as war crimes and genocidal acts. On Tuesday, he attended a dinner with senior Republican Party members, including GOP House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (Indiana), at the Donald Trump-owned estate. “I had the honor and privilege of meeting with senior members of the Republican Party at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate,” Ben-Gvir wrote in a post on social media early Wednesday morning. “They expressed support for my clear stance on how action should be taken in Gaza — that food and aid depots should be bombed to create military and political pressure to bring our hostages home,” he said. Israel's campaign of withholding and attacking humanitarian aid efforts has been so horrific that its actions have been deemed not just violations of international law, but also genocidal acts by international law experts. The humanitarian catastrophe that Israel has created in Gaza is currently reaching new depths, aid groups say, with Israel having blocked all aid from entering Gaza for over 50 days now. The UN has said that the crisis is at “unprecedented levels,” with all 2 million Palestinians in Gaza “trapped, starving and desperate,” with food, water, medicine, and all other essential supplies rapidly running out. Two million people — a majority of women and children — are undergoing collective punishment,” said UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) head Philippe Lazzarini in a statement this week. Yet, Ben-Gvir and top Republicans reportedly believe that Israel should bomb what few supplies there are left in Gaza, in a seeming effort to accelerate Israel's extermination campaign. Ben-Gvir has repeatedly called for Israel to resettle Gaza, a genocidal plan supported by President Donald Trump and his administration. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced that he is eliminating an office whose stated mission is to advance human rights across the world, while the State Department is also eliminating condemnations of human rights violations from its annual reports, including denunciations of poor prison conditions. At the meeting with GOP leaders, as well as dozens of business men from Miami, Ben-Gvir boasted about eroding conditions in Israel's torture camps, where Palestinians are tortured to death, among other abuses. We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.” Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Vice President JD Vance said on April 23 that the U.S. presented a "very explicit proposal" to Russia and Ukraine on a peace deal, repeating warnings Washington might drop its peace effort if the belligerent sides refuse. "We have engaged in an extraordinary amount of diplomacy and on-the-ground work. We really tried to understand things from the perspectives of both Ukrainians and Russians," he said. "I think that we put together a very fair proposal." Vance added that "it's now time to take, if not the final step, one of the final steps"— with all parties agreeing to stop the fighting, freeze territorial lines "at some level close to where they are," and pursue a long-term diplomatic settlement. Vance noted that eventual borders may not exactly follow the current front line but stressed it is currently necessary to lay down arms and "freeze" the war. Following Vance's remarks, a spokesperson for Downing Street told AFP on April 23: "We support U.S.-led efforts to bring about a lasting end to the war. Ultimately, it must be for Ukraine to decide its future." The comments follow reporting that the U.S. is ready to recognize Russia's de jure control over Crimea and de facto control over occupied territories in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts as part of a peace deal. President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected the possibility of recognizing Russian hold over Crimea. Earlier, a source close to French President Emmanuel Macron told AFP that "respect for Ukraine's territorial integrity and its European aspirations are very strong demands of the Europeans." A Ukrainian delegation met with European officials and U.S. Special Envoy Keith Kellogg in London on April 23 to continue discussions on a possible path to peace, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a statement on X. "During our meeting with U.S. Special Envoy General Keith Kellogg, we had a constructive exchange of views on the path to peace," Sybiha wrote. The London meeting, originally intended as a ministerial-level summit involving the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, and Ukraine, was notably downgraded after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff declined to participate. Following the meetings in London, Ukrainian Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak reiterated Kyiv's position, saying, "An immediate, complete and unconditional ceasefire should be the first step towards the start of negotiations on achieving a just and lasting peace." Despite the absence of Rubio and Witkoff, the U.K. Foreign Ministry said "significant progress was made on reaching a common position," and that all parties reaffirmed support for U.S. President Donald Trump's stated commitment to achieving a just and lasting peace. The meeting followed a summit in Paris on April 17, where senior Trump administration officials outlined a controversial peace proposal to Ukrainian and European delegates. The plan reportedly includes recognition of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and a ban on Ukraine's NATO membership — two central demands by the Kremlin. President Donald Trump claimed in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, that the U.S. is not forcing Ukraine to recognize Crimea as Russian, following reports that a U.S. peace plan includes the U.S. formally recognizing Moscow's illegal annexation of Crimea. "Nobody is asking (President Volodymyr) Zelensky to recognize Crimea as Russian Territory, but if he wants Crimea, why didn't they fight for it eleven years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?" Trump's remarks come one day after President Volodymyr Zelensky reaffirmed that Ukraine would never legally recognize Russia's control of Crimea. In response, Trump called Zelensky's position "harmful to the peace negotiations with Russia," claiming that Crimea "was lost years ago under the auspices of President Barack Hussein Obama, and is not even a point of discussion." The claim that Crimea was taken without force is false. During Russia's 2014 annexation, armed Russian troops in unmarked uniforms seized Ukrainian government buildings, military installations, and blockaded bases. At least one Ukrainian serviceman was killed, and dozens were detained or assaulted. Trump also argued that "even before the annexation of Crimea, major Russian submarine bases" were present there, and accused Zelensky of inflaming tensions with rhetoric that complicates peace efforts. Despite expressing frustration over Russia's refusal to de-escalate the war, the U.S. president has so far avoided imposing any major sanctions or taking punitive action against Moscow for its invasion. While Trump appeared to frame the proposal as something Ukraine could reject, he notably did not deny that the U.S. might move forward with formally recognizing Crimea as Russian territory, something Russia had wanted for years. Recognition of the annexation would contradict a decade of bipartisan U.S. policy and a 2014 United Nations General Assembly resolution, in which 100 member states declared the seizure illegal. Since 2014, Moscow has used intimidation, religious profiling, and politically motivated terrorism charges to suppress dissent among Crimean Tatars. China's Foreign Ministry on April 23 accused Ukraine of making "groundless" accusations after the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry summoned a Chinese ambassador to present evidence of Chinese involvement in Russia's war. The Chinese Foreign Ministry called Ukraine's recent statements "groundless" and "political manipulations." "We have clarified China's position on the relevant issues. China strongly opposes groundless accusations and political manipulations," Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said during a press briefing. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on April 17 that China is supplying weapons to Russia, marking Kyiv's first confirmation that Beijing supports Russia's war effort by direct military aid. Iran and North Korea are two other allies of Moscow that supply Russia with arms. Though Beijing has long denied supplying arms, multiple reports have suggested otherwise. In summer 2024, Zelensky said China had assured Ukraine it would not deliver weapons to Russia. While officially claiming neutrality, Beijing has deepened economic ties with Moscow, supported Russia against Western sanctions, and emerged as a top supplier of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense sector. Earlier this month, Ukrainian forces captured two Chinese nationals fighting for Russia in Donetsk Oblast. Zelensky later said that "several hundred" Chinese nationals were fighting on Russia's side. Independent news channel Astra reported earlier in the day that a Ukrainian long-range drone strike had targeted Alabuga, sharing purported footage of a drone being shot down. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that Russian air defenses shot down one Ukrainian airplane-type drone in Tatarstan at about 12:20 p.m. local time, without providing further details or mentioning Alabuga. The facility that was hit manufactures up to 300 Iranian-style Shahed drones and their Russian-made variants, Gerans, per day, according to the General Staff. Shahed-style drones are frequently used by Russia in attacks on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Ukraine hit targets over 1,000 kilometers last year for the first time, with one attack occurring 1,800 kilometers (1,118 miles) from the border in Russia's Murmansk Oblast. “The strike is a justified response against a strategic military site used to support Russia's aggression and terror against Ukraine and Ukrainian civilians," the General Staff statement read. Over 6,000 Shahed-type drones were produced in Alabuga last year, as well as thousands of decoy drones used to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses, said Andrii Kovalenko, an official at Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council. Russian forces launch hundreds of drones nearly every night at Ukraine, targeting civilian areas and critical infrastructure. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has urged a temporary freeze on long-range drone and missile strikes, but Kremlin officials have dismissed the idea.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump slammed Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday for his comments that Ukraine wouldn't recognize Russian control of Crimea, calling the remarks “very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia.” The situation for Ukraine is dire — He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country,” he posted on Truth Social. His comments came a few hours after a meeting in London aimed at bringing about an end to Russia's war in Ukraine had been downgraded after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he wouldn't attend. Rubio had been expected to take part in the discussions with Ukrainian, UK and European officials, but State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Tuesday that he would no longer attend due to “logistical issues,” though a US official and two European diplomats familiar with the matter said the top US diplomat didn't go because the administration did not feel that they were at a decisive point in the ongoing talks and Rubio didn't feel attending would be the best use of his time. “It was better to let talks play out than create the illusion that a breakthrough was imminent,” said one of the European diplomats. Britain's Foreign Office confirmed on Wednesday that the meeting would take place at a lower level. “Official level talks will continue but these are closed to media,” the department said in a message to journalists. The United States has become increasingly steadfast in its push to force Kyiv to an agreement, but Ukraine is adamant that it will not give up Crimea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014, or parts of eastern Ukraine that were captured following Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022. Related article Russia launches deadly aerial barrage on Ukraine as US pushes for peace plan But Ukraine's European allies, particularly Britain and France, have been hoping to bridge the divide. Wednesday's talks were due to follow a meeting in Paris last week in which officials from the US, the United Kingdom, France and Germany discussed the American framework for a ceasefire. After Rubio reversed plans to attend the latest talks, Bruce said President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, would represent the US in London instead. Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Russia on Friday, a US official said. The US proposal that has caused deadlock includes recognizing Russia's control of Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula illegally annexed by Moscow, an official familiar with the framework told CNN. “Ukraine will not legally recognize the occupation of Crimea,” he told reporters. Asked to clarify about whether he meant the US wanted to freeze the territorial lines where they are, Vance said Wednesday, “No, I didn't say that. There's gonna have to be some territorial swaps.” Meanwhile, the war has resumed with full force this week, following a surprise ceasefire over the Easter weekend that both sides accused each other of breaching. On Wednesday, Ukrainian authorities said nine people were killed and at least 30 wounded when a Russian drone struck a bus carrying people to work near the city of Marhanets in the Dnipropetrovsk region. Russia's National Guard said it destroyed 17 Ukrainian attack drones overnight, state-run news agency Tass reported on Wednesday. The broad framework has been presented to both sides, Rubio and the State Department have said, to determine whether the differences can be narrowed in a short timeframe. Moscow has previously stalled on ceasefire negotiations and rejected an earlier US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire agreed to by Kyiv. However, under pressure from Trump, Ukraine and Russia have expressed willingness to negotiate for the first time in years; the two sides have not held direct talks since the early weeks of Moscow's invasion in 2022. On Monday, Putin raised the prospect of holding direct talks with Ukraine about a ceasefire that would halt striking civilian targets, but said further discussion was needed on how to define a civilian target. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later confirmed the Russian president's remarks, saying “(Putin) had in mind negotiations and discussions with the Ukrainian side,” Reuters reported, citing Russia's Interfax news agency.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite their immense size, species of prehistoric giant kangaroos from a site in Queensland were probably homebodies with a surprisingly small range compared to other kangaroos, according to new Australian research. Given their size, researchers expected they might have an expansive territory, said University of Wollongong palaeo-ecologist Chris Laurikainen Gaete, the co-author of the study published in PLOS One. That's because in most modern plant-eating mammals, including kangaroos and other macropods, larger body size correlated with geographic range, he said. A small marsupial such as the pademelon, for example, occupies an area smaller than a kilometre squared, whereas the red kangaroo – the largest of all kinds – in outback Australia can hop long distances, sometimes further than 20km. These protemnodon kept to close quarters, living and dying near the caves where their remains were found. Co-author Dr Scott Hocknull, a vertebrate palaeontologist and senior curator at the Queensland Museum, said the individuals from Mt Etna seemed to be “real homebodies” that stayed within “a tiny pocket” in and around the limestone caves. The population at Mt Etna was “probably quite happy” for some time, Hocknull said. Dr Isaac Kerr, who specialises in kangaroo palaeontology at Flinders University and was not involved with the study, said protemnodon fossils – found mainly in the south and east of the country – indicated there were several species adapted to different environments. “Probably they were all over the whole continent, including New Guinea,” he said. A site in Tasmania had one of the latest surviving species, dated to 41,000 years ago. Kerr said these megafauna kangaroos ranged in size but were generally stockier than their modern counterparts, with shorter feet. The researchers' next step was to apply similar techniques to fossils of smaller kangaroos such as tree kangaroos, pademelons and rock wallabies from Mt Etna, which still have living descendants, to understand how they survived the environmental changes while protemnodon died out. “Strontium is an element that varies in the environment, specifically in underlying bedrocks – so a limestone will have a significantly different strontium signature compared to something like volcanic rock or basalt,” he said. These unique signatures made their way into soil and plants, and were reflected in the fossilised teeth of herbivores that ate those plants. Laurikainen Gaete said the technique could be used to understand, on a site-by-site basis, why certain species of megafauna disappeared from particular places. Hocknull said: “It fundamentally shifts how palaeontologists and ecologists look at the fossil record.”</p>

PARIS, April 23. /TASS/. The withdrawal of the Ukrainian military from the territories of Russia's constituent regions of Donbass and Novorossiya is necessary to establish peace in Ukraine, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told France's Le Point in the interview.

"If Ukraine withdraws its troops from these four regions, then yes," he said when asked by the magazine's correspondent whether the conflict would end if this condition was met.

The Kremlin spokesman recalled that these regions are enshrined in the Russian Constitution as an integral part of it. He also noted that at the moment some territories of these regions are still occupied by the Kiev regime. "According to the results of the referendums, these territories have entered the administrative borders of Russia. From our point of view, this is a de jure and de facto situation," Peskov said.</p>

Montreal, Canada — The United States has loomed large over Canada's upcoming election, with concerns over President Donald Trump's tariffs and annexation threats dominating much of the campaign. “This is a priority issue for many Canadians,” said Dania Majid, a Palestinian community advocate and lawyer based in Toronto, in an interview with Truthout. “We are not detached from what is happening in Palestine.” Last month, a survey commissioned by the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) found that 55 percent of Canadian voters backed a ban on weapons exports to Israel as the war in Gaza dragged on. Another 49 percent said they would support extending that ban to weapons parts and military training, as well. A recent Canadian Muslim Public Affairs Council (CMPAC) election survey also found that 58 percent of Canadian Muslims said Canada's policy on Palestine was their top concern. More than 86 percent of respondents also said they viewed the Canadian government's position as “completely inadequate.” And in mid-April, thousands of people from across Canada converged on Parliament Hill in the capital, Ottawa, to demand action from Canada's political leaders to end Israel's war on Gaza. In the occupied West Bank, frequent Israeli military and settler attacks were forcing thousands of Palestinians from their homes. Despite an election race dominated by anxieties around Trump's threats against Canada as well as housing and grocery costs, activists have forced Palestine into the conversation. The goal, Majid explained, has been to show Canada's politicians that the situation in Palestine has gone beyond foreign policy to become a domestic political issue — and something that they cannot ignore. “We want to ask those who are seeking to be our representatives on Parliament Hill what their positions are on Palestine and what they are going to do about supporting Palestinian human rights,” she told Truthout. But Palestinian rights advocates and other experts say that, in practice, Canada has largely sided with Israel, a country with which it maintains strong economic and diplomatic ties. Meanwhile, similar to scenes in the U.S., students at Montreal's McGill University and the University of Toronto erected protest encampments last year to end what they said was their schools' complicity in Israel's war. Those were some of the same demands that rang out less than two weeks before Election Day as dozens of people gathered in the Montreal neighborhood of Parc-Extension to send a message to their local political candidates. She said Canadian politicians have long treated Palestine as something they can ignore, but that has been changing. Organizers have urged political candidates to sign onto its five-point platform, which includes imposing a two-way arms embargo on Israel, recognizing the State of Palestine, and funding the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which provides most of the aid in Gaza. The platform also calls on Canada to end any involvement in illegal Israeli settlements and address anti-Palestinian racism and efforts to crack down on pro-Palestinian speech domestically. As of April 21, one week before Election Day, more than 300 electoral candidates had endorsed the full “Vote Palestine” platform. Others from the Liberal, Green and Bloc Quebecois parties have also signed on. Majid, the campaign organizer, said that, as a nonpartisan effort, “Vote Palestine” is not endorsing any parties or candidates. “This is very much about empowering people because we hear often — and we saw this in the U.S. election — people feel very disenfranchised. They go to the polls, but their representatives never represent them,” Majid said. Indeed, despite an election race dominated by anxieties around Trump's threats against Canada as well as housing and grocery costs, activists have forced Palestine into the conversation. Notably, the leaders of Canada's main political parties have been asked about their positions on Gaza during recent debates. On April 17, frontrunner Mark Carney, who replaced former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the leader of the Liberal Party in March, said Canada must work to impose “maximum pressure” to reach an immediate ceasefire. But Carney has drawn criticism for refusing to describe what is happening in Gaza as a “genocide” — a term scholars, human rights groups, and other experts have used to describe Israel's military campaign and siege on the enclave. “We know that if you can't name genocide, you definitely won't stop it,” the advocacy group Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East said on social media of Carney's stance. Pro-Israel lobby groups in Canada have been outspoken during the Gaza war, defending the Israeli government's policies and attacking lawmakers who have spoken out about human rights abuses against Palestinians. Framing their unwavering support for Israel as part of a fight against anti-Semitism, these groups have maintained close ties to Canada's two main political parties — the Liberals and the Conservatives — for years. Israel, too, has enjoyed friendly relations with both Liberal and Conservative prime ministers. The government's announcement that it was barring any Canadian-made arms from reaching Gaza, for example, drew anger among Israeli leaders. He has promised to cut funding for UNRWA, the UN agency responsible for delivering humanitarian assistance in Gaza, which he has called a “terrorist” organization. Poilievre also recently said a Conservative government would deport non-Canadians who take part in what he dubbed “hate marches,” referring to pro-Palestine demonstrations. He also promised a “tougher” response for Canadians who participate. Poilievre's comments drew comparisons to Trump, whose administration has moved to deport students and permanent residents in the U.S. who have spoken out against Israel's war on Gaza. Khaled Al-Qazzaz, executive director of the CMPAC advocacy group, said the Conservative leader's positions are “not acceptable” for members of Canada's Muslim community. Recent protests in solidarity with Palestinians have been “peaceful and absent of any form of violence,” said Al-Qazzaz, stressing that Muslim Canadians have been reeling from what is happening in Gaza. To date, the campaign has endorsed 47 candidates it says have expressed support for — or have a strong track record of standing up for — Palestinians. “More importantly, there is more of a united front — whether on the organizational level or [in the] community — that is united by a cause.” But will Canada's Palestine policy really have an impact on the election outcome? Al-Qazzaz said he believes Muslim voters can influence races in areas where their communities make up a large chunk of the electorate, such as ridings in the Greater Toronto Area and in British Columbia on Canada's west coast. The country's Muslim population more than doubled between 2001 and 2021, the last year for which data is available, going from about 580,000 to more than 1.7 million people in that 20-year span. This makes the Muslim vote an impactful decision-maker, or kingmaker,” Al-Qazzaz said. Yet whatever happens on April 28, both Al-Qazzaz and Majid stressed that the push to get Canadian politicians to speak out on Palestine will continue beyond the election. They each described support for Palestinian rights as a “litmus test” that demonstrates not only where a politician stands on foreign policy but on a range of domestic issues as well, including social programs, immigrant rights, and freedoms in Canada. If they haven't signed the pledge, then there's an opportunity to keep that conversation going,” Majid said. We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency. Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.” Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A major meeting in London aimed at bringing about an end to Russia's war in Ukraine has been downgraded after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he would skip the summit, escalating a clash between Washington and Kyiv over the future of Russian-occupied territory. Rubio had been expected to take part in the discussions with Ukrainian, UK and European officials, but State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Tuesday that he would no longer attend due to “logistical issues.” London's Foreign Office then confirmed on Wednesday that the meeting would take place at a lower level. “Official level talks will continue but these are closed to media,” the department said in a message to journalists. The United States has become increasingly steadfast in its push to force Kyiv to an agreement, but Ukraine is adamant that it will not give up Crimea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014, or parts of eastern Ukraine that were captured following Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022. President Donald Trump slammed Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday for his comments that Ukraine wouldn't recognize Russian control of Crimea, calling the remarks “very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia.” The situation for Ukraine is dire — He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country,” he posted on Truth Social. Related article Russia launches deadly aerial barrage on Ukraine as US pushes for peace plan But Ukraine's European allies, particularly Britain and France, have been hoping to bridge the divide. Wednesday's talks were due to follow a meeting in Paris last week in which officials from the US, the United Kingdom, France and Germany discussed the American framework for a ceasefire. After Rubio reversed plans to attend the latest talks, Bruce said President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, would represent the US in London instead. The US proposal that has caused deadlock includes recognizing Russia's control of Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula illegally annexed by Moscow, an official familiar with the framework told CNN. “Ukraine will not legally recognize the occupation of Crimea,” he told reporters. Asked to clarify about whether he meant the US wanted to freeze the territorial lines where they are, Vance said Wednesday, “No, I didn't say that. There's gonna have to be some territorial swaps.” Meanwhile, the war has resumed with full force this week, following a surprise ceasefire over the Easter weekend that both sides accused each other of breaching. On Wednesday, Ukrainian authorities said nine people were killed and at least 30 wounded when a Russian drone struck a bus carrying people to work near the city of Marhanets in the Dnipropetrovsk region. Russia's National Guard said it destroyed 17 Ukrainian attack drones overnight, state-run news agency Tass reported on Wednesday. The broad framework has been presented to both sides, Rubio and the State Department have said, to determine whether the differences can be narrowed in a short timeframe. The Kremlin confirmed Witkoff's visit, but did not disclose further details, according to Russian state media. Moscow has previously stalled on ceasefire negotiations and rejected an earlier US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire agreed to by Kyiv. However, under pressure from Trump, Ukraine and Russia have expressed willingness to negotiate for the first time in years; the two sides have not held direct talks since the early weeks of Moscow's invasion in 2022. On Monday, Putin raised the prospect of holding direct talks with Ukraine about a ceasefire that would halt striking civilian targets, but said further discussion was needed on how to define a civilian target. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later confirmed the Russian president's remarks, saying “(Putin) had in mind negotiations and discussions with the Ukrainian side,” Reuters reported, citing Russia's Interfax news agency.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MOSCOW, April 23. /TASS/. African countries are tired of the arrogant behavior and double standards of the former West European colonial powers, Russia's Permanent Representative to the UN Vasily Nebenzya said at the plenary session of the 4th Forum "Russia-Africa: What Next? "We are convinced that the crisis situations that many African countries are currently going through are predominantly a consequence of long years of colonial dependence, consistent opposition to the manifestation of neo-colonial practices in Africa, where there is a real fatigue with the arrogant behavior and double standards of the former West European colonial powers," he said in a video message to the forum's participants. Russia's ambassador to the UN added that Africans do not intend to put up with this state of affairs. Nebenzya recalled that Russia, in its turn, consistently opposes modern practices of neocolonialism. "Trust in the collective West as a partner is declining everywhere, and there is a growing demand for fundamental changes in the modern system of international relations. Examples of successful cooperation on independent multilateral platforms, such as the Non-Aligned Movement, are multiplying," he emphasized. Nebenzya also noted that the UN Security Council should adapt to the growing role of African countries in global world affairs and "keep pace with these processes."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American Lung Association's study says almost 156 million people live in areas with unhealthy levels of soot or smog Almost half of Americans are breathing in dangerous levels of air pollutants, a new report shows, a rise compared with a year ago and likely to further increase in coming years thanks to the climate crisis and the Trump administration's sweeping environmental rollbacks. Just over 156 million people live in neighborhoods with unhealthy levels of soot or smog – a 16% rise compared with last year and the highest number in a decade, according to the American Lung Association (ALA) annual state of the air report. Every year, the ALA grades exposure to unhealthy levels of ground-level smog (ozone pollution), and year-round and short-term spikes in soot (fine particle pollution/PM2.5) over a three-year period (2021 to 2023). Its latest analysis found that almost 43m people live in areas with failing grades for all three measures. But Latino Americans are the most impacted, and three times more likely to be breathing in both toxic air pollutants. The new report includes data from summer 2023, when smoke from wildfires across Canada lit up the sky and engulfed midwestern and eastern states in soot. Ozone or smog is a potent respiratory irritant likened to causing sunburn of the lungs. Warmer temperatures increase the risk of ozone forming and makes it harder to clean up. “Families across the US are dealing with the health impacts of air pollution every day, and extreme heat and wildfires are making it worse. Air pollution is causing kids to have asthma attacks, making people who work outdoors sick, and leading to low birth weight in babies,” said Harold Wimmer, the president and CEO of the American Lung Association. Only two cities, Bangor, Maine, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, were ranked as clean cities with no spikes in smog or soot, reflecting an overall worsening of air quality across the country, the report found. “Efforts to slash staff, funding and programs at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are leaving families even more vulnerable to harmful air pollution,” Wimmer said. Environmental justice has come under particular attack, with Trump conflating efforts to address decades of environmental racism that led to poor air quality from heavy industry, landfills and highways being deliberately located in communities of color with diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reports that the U.S. could formally give de jure recognition to Russia's control over Crimea have landed like a bombshell in Kyiv, with lawmakers unanimous in their opposition to such a move, as well as issuing grave warnings about its potential consequences. "Ukraine should not side with those intending to violate the fundamental principles established after World War II," he added. The Trump administration's final proposal for ending the Russia-Ukraine war included U.S. de jure recognition of Russia's control over Crimea, along with de facto recognition of its occupation of other Ukrainian territories, Axios reported on April 23, citing sources. The news supports earlier reporting that the recognition of Russia's occupation of Crimea and a ban on Ukraine joining NATO are being considered as part of a U.S.-backed proposal to end the war. I cannot imagine us agreeing to this if it's real de jure recognition, if I'm honest. De facto recognition would mean accepting that where Russian troops are in control of Ukrainian territory, at least for the foreseeable future, they remain so. But it would leave open the option of the land returning to Ukraine, potentially by diplomatic means, something President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously acknowledged could be the only way to regain control of Crimea. De jure recognition, however, would be final — an admission that the land in question is under Russian control and will remain so indefinitely. The only means of reversing it would be by force. Russia occupied Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in February 2014. The sham voting on annexation was conducted in the absence of any international observers and with armed Russian soldiers present at polling locations. Ukrainian lawmakers who spoke to the Kyiv Independent said recognizing Russia's de jure control of the peninsula is next to impossible. "The Ukrainian Constitution does not provide for the recognition of its territories as being seized by another (country)," Ariev said. According to the Ukrainian Constitution, Crimea is a legally recognized and inseparable part of Ukraine. "No Ukrainian government has a mandate to recognize Crimea as Russian," Halyna Yanchenko, a lawmaker from the Servant of the People party, told the Kyiv Independent. "Any peace agreement that includes such a provision would risk sparking unrest within the country. That's why no Ukrainian leadership would ever agree to it. Ukraine finds itself in what Zelensky on April 22 described as "a very dangerous moment," with the U.S. threatening to back out of the peace effort if Kyiv doesn't agree to its proposal. All of this risks playing into the hands of the Kremlin, with both Moscow and Washington potentially being able to point to Ukraine's refusal as the main sticking point of negotiations. "Ukraine will never agree," Oleksandr Merezhko, lawmaker and chair of the parliament's foreign affairs committee, told the Kyiv Independent. "Recognizing territory seized by military means — this would be the first such recognition since World War II — sets a dangerous precedent that could reignite wars in the future, which could potentially reach the scale of World War III," he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former NHL players Cal Foote, Dillon Dubé, Alex Formenton, Michael McLeod and Carter Hart, accused in a sexual assault following the World Junior Hockey Championships in 2018, arrive at the Court House in London, Ont., on April 23.The Globe and Mail/The Canadian Press Crown attorney Heather Donkers began laying out the prosecution's case against five former members of Canada's world junior men's hockey team on Wednesday afternoon, the first day of their sexual-assault trial in London, Ont. “This case is not about whether [E.M.] said ‘no' or removed herself from an unwelcome situation when she had the opportunity,” Ms. Donkers said. “This case is about whether [E.M.] voluntarily agreed to engage in each and every sexual act that took place, at the time that it happened.” The complainant's name is protected by a publication ban. Michael McLeod, Carter Hart, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dubé and Cal Foote are accused of sexually assaulting E.M. in a hotel room after a Hockey Canada gala in June, 2018. The morning began with Ontario Superior Court Justice Maria Carroccia addressing the 14-person jury, instructing them on their obligations, including that they are to keep an open-mind and resist the urge to fall prey to myths and stereotypes about how sexual-assault complainants are supposed to behave. Said Ms. Donkers: “It's important that you keep this instruction in mind, as the evidence that we anticipate you will hear in this case may not match up with expectations you have about what a sexual assault is or looks like.” Then shortly after 1:20 a.m. on June 19, 2018, Ms. Donkers said that E.M. left Jack's with Mr. McLeod and had consensual sex at the Delta hotel in room 209. The jury, Ms. Donkers said, will see a copy of those text messages, including one that read: “who wants to be in a 3 way quick. Ms. Donkers said that the jury will also hear that Mr. McLeod went into the hallway and invited others into his room, where E.M. was laying naked. “There were up to 10 men inside this standard-sized hotel room at different points in the night,” Ms. Donkers said. “You will hear from some witnesses that, at different times in the night, [E.M.] was offering to perform sexual acts or was asking whether anyone was going to have sex with her,” Ms. Donkers said. Ms. Donkers said that the jury will hear that each of the five players engaged in sexual acts with E.M. without her voluntary agreement. Mr. Dubé is accused of slapping E.M.'s naked buttocks while she was engaged in a sexual act with another player. The Crown also explained the second charge against Mr. McLeod, saying this relates to the allegation that Mr. McLeod “assisted and encouraged” his teammates to engage in sexual acts with E.M., while knowing she had not consented. The Crown also addressed the existence of two brief videos taken that night, in which E.M. can be seen saying statements such as “it was all consensual.” Ms. Donkers noted that Justice Carroccia will explain that consent must be given for each sexual act at the time it is happening. The prosecution's evidence has not been tested in court. Canada's junior hockey team won the world championship in 2018. Afterward, many members of the team went out celebrating downtown. The sexual assault is alleged to have occurred that night. An initial investigation from London police was closed without charges in 2019, but the file was reopened after a wave of national outrage surfaced when the case became public three years later. In 2022, TSN reported that Hockey Canada had quietly settled a lawsuit brought forward by the complainant. The Globe and Mail then revealed that Hockey Canada had been using a so-called National Equity Fund, a pool of money collected in part through registration fees, to pay out settlements to sexual-assault complainants.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's bold move to hike tariffs on Chinese goods to 145 percent—met by Beijing's 125 percent retaliation—has reignited a national debate over trade, economic independence, and the future of U.S. industry. A new poll of 18,438 Epoch Times readers shows broad support for Trump's tough stance against the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and its decades-long record of exploiting global trade to the detriment of U.S. manufacturing and national security. The tariffs target what Trump calls the CCP's predatory tactics: currency manipulation, intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers, and market-warping state subsidies that systematically disadvantage U.S. businesses. By zeroing in on strategic sectors such as steel, technology, and critical minerals, the administration's trade overhaul aims to close the U.S.–China trade gap, fortify national security, and bring manufacturing back to U.S. soil. While some respondents expressed concern about the potential harm to U.S. exporters and consumers, most said they remained unfazed. At the same time, signs of strain are emerging within China itself. Exporters, factory owners, and industry observers have voiced growing alarm as profit margins vanish, orders dry up, and job losses mount. Critics of Beijing's response argue that the CCP's failure to negotiate may backfire, deepening China's economic isolation just as other nations seek new trade terms with Washington. A clear majority of readers supported the electronics exemption, with 32 percent strongly agreeing and another 32 percent somewhat agreeing that it was a prudent move. When asked whether the price of electronics is likely to rise despite the exemption, 23 percent strongly agreed and 40 percent somewhat agreed that it is—meaning a total of 63 percent believe to some degree that prices will rise despite the exemption. China, which dominates the rare earth mineral market and mines roughly 60 percent of the world's total supply, has imposed export controls on these essential elements as part of its response to the Trump administration's tariffs. Rare earth metals are a group of 17 essential elements that are critical in many modern technologies, both civilian and military. Securing supply chains for these elements, which have no practical substitutes, has been a priority for Trump as he seeks to strengthen the United States' manufacturing base. On the issue of China's dominance in rare earth minerals and critical components, 52 percent of respondents said they strongly agree—and 19 percent somewhat agree—that this poses a serious risk to U.S. national security. Trump's tariffs are intended to reverse this decades-long decline by shielding domestic industries from the CCP's trade abuses. The effort has raised a fundamental question: Are Americans willing to do factory work in a country where the workforce has largely shifted toward service sector and office jobs? Respondents also emphasized the critical role of education and job training. Half of all participants strongly agreed that the United States cannot rebuild a strong manufacturing base without serious reforms in vocational and technical education. Respondents also showed strong support for education and vocational training reform as a foundation for rebuilding the domestic industry. Half of all respondents said they strongly agree that without serious reforms in education and job training, the United States cannot rebuild a strong manufacturing base. However, when asked whether a lack of skilled labor and waning interest in factory work is a greater obstacle than policy or taxes, opinion was more divided. Although Trump has offered to lower tariffs if Beijing engages in serious negotiations, the CCP has shown little interest in compromise. When asked whether the Chinese regime would change course without sustained economic pressure, an overwhelming 86 percent of poll respondents agreed that it would, with 75 percent strongly agreeing. Seventeen percent said they believe that alliances and diplomatic engagement offer a better long-term strategy for confronting the CCP, while 70 percent disagreed. By contrast, 10 percent strongly agreed that diplomacy and alliances—not tariffs—are the better long-term path to confronting Beijing. The poll also revealed a near-unanimous view that China's track record—on intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers, and product dumping—has undermined global trade fairness. Poll results show overwhelming support for that vision. Eighty-nine percent of respondents said that rebuilding manufacturing is critical to national strength and global leadership, while 7 percent disagreed. When asked which factors are most critical to bringing manufacturing back, respondents pointed to education, tax policy, and cultural values. Sixty-four percent supported a more competitive overall tax and regulatory environment, while 60 percent identified stronger tariffs and trade enforcement. There was clear frustration with what many described as an underprepared, over-entitled workforce. Some called for banning social media in classrooms, dismantling the Department of Education, and returning to character-based instruction rooted in discipline, patriotism, and a good work ethic. Others called for removing Chinese nationals involved in espionage or influence operations. Several respondents blamed decades of U.S. corporate and political naivete for empowering Beijing at the expense of U.S. industry and sovereignty. While many still championed bringing key industries—such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and defense—back to U.S. soil, others emphasized that modern manufacturing is increasingly automated. They warned against nostalgic ideas of factory floors packed with workers, and instead pushed for strategic planning focused on innovation, high-tech infrastructure, and workforce readiness. Several respondents also noted that reshoring would likely raise consumer prices, and that a cultural shift—toward valuing industrial work and recognizing the changing nature of manufacturing in the 21st century—will be necessary. Together, the poll results and written responses reflect more than support for Trump's tariff strategy—they reveal a deeper desire for structural reform, cultural renewal, and national resilience. For many Epoch Times readers, restoring U.S. manufacturing is about more than just jobs or economics—it's about rebuilding the foundations of American strength, independence, and identity.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Evidence filed by Trans Mountain with the Canadian Energy Regulator shows that the proposed tolls to ship oil to China are $9.19 per barrel higher than shipping on an Enbridge pipeline to the U.S. Gulf.JASON FRANSON/The Canadian Press Thomas Gunton is professor and founding director of the Resource and Environmental Planning Program at Simon Fraser University and recently completed a report for the International Institute for Sustainable Development on the Trans Mountain Pipeline. But while there is a consensus that we need new strategies to confront the threat, we need to be careful that we do not simply make things worse by ill-advised initiatives cobbled together in the heat of the crisis. While such a strategy has intuitive appeal, it would end up being a costly blunder that would do more harm than good to the Canadian economy. No one knows for sure what the rate of decline will be, but both the International Energy Agency and private oil companies such as BP forecast a small to significant decline as high as 75 per cent by 2050, depending on future climate policies. And even if Canadian production increases, the Canadian Energy Regulator concludes that there is sufficient pipeline capacity in place – with minor low-cost expansions of existing pipelines – to meet even their most optimistic demand forecast. In this environment, building new pipelines to diversify our export markets would simply duplicate existing pipelines we have already built that ship oil to the United States. Second, the costs of duplicating existing pipelines would be enormous. The expanded Trans Mountain pipeline, for example, cost just over $34-billion to add 590,000 barrels per day of new capacity. At this rate, diverting all four mb/d exports shipped to the U.S. would cost $235-billion and building this new capacity, let alone financing it, would be prohibitive. And even if we were able to add major new capacity at a slower rate, the incremental shipment costs would be higher than any likely long-term tariffs on Canadian oil exports. At the average 2024 Western Canadian Select price of around $87 per barrel, producers would have to receive between 15 per cent and 25 per cent less per barrel shipped to the U.S. for the entire 40-year operating life of the pipeline before they would consider building one. This is why no private company has proposed building a new pipeline and will not consider the option without a massive taxpayer subsidy, even if the review process is streamlined. It may have made sense to diversify export markets when the original pipeline infrastructure was being planned, or if there are any future expansions, but the die has been cast for oil. Canada needs to diversify its exports and strengthen its economy by, for example, removing internal trade barriers, investing in energy conservation and expanding interprovincial electricity infrastructure to meet the growing demand for clean energy. Clearly, we would be better off using our scarce capital on these and other needed investments with a higher return and negotiating the removal of tariffs instead of building duplicate pipeline capacity that will make us worse off.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dana White's alliance with Trump has redefined his company as more than just a typical sports brand While one would not normally expect to see the leader of the free world and one of his top advisers – who also happens to be the world's “richest man” – strolling through scenes of bloodied knockouts and half-naked staredowns, it was not unusual for Mr Trump, or fans of UFC. In fact, the cheers from the blood-thirsty crowd were arguably louder and more emotionally charged than what you might expect to see at CPAC or a Trump rally. It has become an arena where traditional masculinity is openly celebrated. At its centre is White, who rescued the company from bankruptcy in the early 2000s and transformed it into a multi-billion dollar global enterprise. Mr Trump has always been in the UFC's orbit. In fact, he was one of the few figures who offered White a platform in the sport's early days, allowing events to be hosted at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City when others refused. Then, last November, after Trump's re-election victory, the UFC boss joined Mr Trump and his family on stage in Florida to celebrate. Andrew Schulz, who welcomed the president on his podcast, is also a regular attender. Even Andrew Tate was welcomed last month as if he wasn't under investigation for alleged sexual assault and human trafficking. In short, this is where the “bro vote”, which helped elect Mr Trump, hangs out. It's here chronically-online, often politically uncommitted Gen Z men who helped Mr Trump find viral fame on TikTok, and soaked up his messaging on podcasts, mix with politics. Young white men aged between 18 and 29 voted overwhelmingly for Mr Trump, with 64 per cent of the demographic opting for the Republican, according to Tufts. The Tufts data shows that, overall, the Republican party saw more youth votes than in 2020 – 30 per cent compared to 39 per cent last year. Young men of colour also voted for Mr Trump in droves. “You're getting conversations in these podcasts, and you yourself, as a young kid, get to really see who Donald Trump is,” White told The New Yorker of the media strategy. He continued to back Conor McGregor after the Irishman was found liable for rape in a civil court. Mr Trump also recently met with McGregor at the White House, and suggested he was his “favourite” Irish person, despite the court's ruling. White himself was filmed slapping his wife on New Year's Eve 2022, an incident that might have ended a career in another industry. But in the UFC universe, such moments are not only survivable, they are often framed as part of the brand's unvarnished realism. White's influence also appears to stretch beyond the cage. White brought the case to Mr Trump's attention, after Karelina's fiancé – professional boxer Chris van Heerden – contacted him. It was a sign that White now operates in the realm of diplomacy, although unofficially. In January, White was appointed to the board of Meta, where he will help “shape the future of social media and AI”. The UFC has staged major events in Saudi Arabia, which is now playing a central role in negotiations to end the war in Ukraine and was set to be Mr Trump's first international visit, before it was announced he was to attend the Pope's funeral in Rome on Saturday. White also secured lucrative partnerships to host fights in the UAE, with Mr Trump set to visit the country as part of a mini middle-eastern tour in May. The UFC president may say he has no desire to run for office, having expressed a deep disdain for the “disgusting” world of politics after Mr Trump's comeback victory in November. But unlike Musk, it appears White, and his world of UFC, can wield influence far from Washington DC. It is this extraordinary ability to get inside the minds of both Mr Trump and his supporters that propels the sport, its fans and its fighters to such a unique position within Maga circles.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While the United States has most of the 17 rare earth elements and 50 critical minerals underground, it has no industrial capacity to refine them into processed metals and magnets, according to Melissa “Mel” Sanderson, American Rare Earths board member and Critical Minerals Institute co-chair. “I certainly hope, as the administration is working through this critical area—no pun intended, it's a critical area—they realize there's this vulnerability gap, a four to five year gap, no matter how you look at it, in terms of ramping up domestic production,” Sanderson said. Trump's April 2 order gives Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick 180 days to suggest how the federal government can help develop a “circular” domestic rare earth supply chain. The president is also pondering an order allowing deep-sea mining and commercial stockpiling. An analyst who writes about U.S.–China trade relations for The Epoch Times, Graceffo said there are “tons of solutions” to building a domestic rare earth supply chain, including the ongoing negotiations with Ukraine. “In the long run, it's going to be much better if China cuts us off. He questioned if China can sustain its rare earth export restrictions because American industries are their biggest market. “We'll see if this is a real or just another hoop to jump through,” Lange told The Epoch Times. “We're getting close to having something here in the United States.” It will also process dysprosium and terbium, two of the seven restricted “heavies,” by building a refinery near its Halleck Creek mine outside Wheatland, Wyoming. Terbium compounds are used in electronics, semiconductors, and fluorescent lighting. Also in Wyoming, Ramaco Resources is breaking ground on an estimated 1.5 billion-ton rare earth deposit and pilot processing plant at its Brook Mine, while Rare Element Resources has started “proprietary processing and separation operations” at its Bear Lodge demonstration plant in Upton. Oklahoma-based USA Rare Earths, which is opening a “neo-magnet” factory this year, produced its first sample of dysprosium oxide from its Round Top, Texas, mine this year and processed it at its research plant in Wheat Ridge, Colorado. Ucore Rare Metals is developing the Louisiana Strategic Metals Complex in Alexandria with $20 million in state incentives, and Energy Fuels, a uranium mining company, is processing monazite sands to extract rare earths at its White Mesa Mill in Utah. Both are crucial in processing rare earths for the U.S. Department of Defense, which is midway through a five-year plan to build a “sustainable mine-to-magnet supply chain” to support its needs by 2027. The Pentagon said in January it doubled its initial project request beyond military requirements to “strengthen supply chain resilience for … burgeoning high-tech industry as well as … national security needs.” In 2024, MP Materials achieved an all-time U.S. high output at Mountain Pass, delivering more than 45,000 metric tons of rare earth oxides and refined products. “MP is basically China's largest offshore supplier” of rare earth ore, Critical Minerals Institute Executive Chair Jack Lifton said, noting China-based Shanghai Resources Industrial & Trading Co. bought 32,000 tons worth $350 million from MP Materials in 2024. MP Materials did not return phone calls or email interview requests. Meredith Schwartz, research associate at the Center for Strategic & International Studies's Project on Critical Minerals Security, said Lynas, despite being the largest producer outside China, still sends oxides to China because it does not have enough refining capacity. “But even when these facilities are fully operational” at MP Materials and Lynas in the United States, they are nowhere near commercial capacity and dwarfed by China's output, Schwartz said. Progress is being made, but there are setbacks and challenges, Schwartz said, noting that while USA Rare Earths called purifying its first dysprosium oxide “a breakthrough” for the domestic rare earths industry, “significant work remains to turn production of samples in a laboratory into full-scale commercial production.” “Even with recent investments the United States is a long way off from meeting the [Department of Defense] goal for a mine-to-magnet supply chain independent of China, and is even further from rivaling foreign adversaries in this strategic industry,” she said. It recommends Congress incentivize domestic production of rare earth magnets through tax breaks to U.S. manufacturers, which Graceffo endorses as long as it comes with long-awaited permit reform. “It's going to be a matter of Trump repealing or rolling back some of the environmental restrictions, and probably some of our allies doing the same thing,” he said, suggesting American manufacturers will develop efficiencies to produce better, less-expensive products. She said permitting reform is the first of those pinch points. “The system is antiquated, inefficient, and subject to excessive litigation, which is what keeps good projects on the chalkboard for 20-plus years,” she said. Lifton said the Trump administration must establish a China-free “organized market” for rare earths. He's surprised industry groups haven't already done so. You'd think, for example, the car companies all get together and say, ‘Listen, we're not going to talk about our competitive [issues], relative costs, what our next year's model looks like, we're going to talk about common sourcing of rare earth permanent magnet motors because we all need that,'” he said. Sanderson said another rare earth pinch point being addressed by the administration is a new “form of private public partnership” using Development Finance Corp. and Department of Defense money “to serve as an anchor for attracting private investment.” American Rare Earths, for instance, received its $456 million authorization from the U.S. Export-Import Bank through the president's executive actions mandating supply chain resiliency, she said. “You found a lot of nice rocks in the ground. Rare earth mining and processing is “extremely capital intensive and once you have invested and you have started with the operations … these guys, they won't invest if they don't see they're going to be operating the mine for 10 or 20 years,” said Didier Lesueur, CEO of the Western Research Institute in Laramie, Wyoming. Lifton said “big capital is not interested” in rare earths. He noted that corporate global mining companies such as Rio Tinto don't want to mine rare earths. Extracting rare earths from “host rocks” is “a black art kind of thing. Nobody tells you exactly how they do things, and even when they do, you need to be a super specialist to understand,” Lifton said. “Not all deposits ‘concentrate' sufficiently to make them bankable,” she said. Timelines are also difficult to benchmark in rare earths development, she said. Nevertheless, Lifton said, with more than $400 billion in tax credits and other incentives available through 2022's Inflation Reduction Act—at least for now—“Washington is floating on money for these projects.” Lesueur said building a domestic rare earth supply chain will take time, and it's worth taking the time to get it right. It takes time because most of these projects, such as American Rare Earth's Halleck Creek mine, are “green field projects” meaning, they're starting from scratch. Right now, the nation's rare earths industry is “just small stuff in a big spot of land,” Sanderson said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fresh warthog carcass in tow, a poacher speeds away from Zimbabwe's Imire Rhino and Wildlife Conservancy. His arrest comes a short while later, courtesy of Shinga, a Belgian Malinois that perfectly retraced the poacher's 2.8-mile (4.5-kilometer) route home, leading an anti-poaching team to his door. Last October's pursuit ultimately began much further afield, in the sleepy Welsh town of Carmarthen, where Shinga was born and raised. It's run by professional dog trainers Darren Priddle and Jacqui Law, who decided to blend their career experiences of developing working dogs for police, security, and military operations with their love of wildlife, after seeing photos of a poached African rhino on social media in 2015. “We can deploy dogs in the UK to track people … to look for drugs, firearms and explosives, so why could we not look at developing the dogs that we were training for conservation efforts?” The duo has since sent 15 dogs to five sub-Saharan African countries, including Mozambique and Tanzania, each one bred by them in southwest Wales. They usually breed one or two litters each year. Dutch shepherds and Belgian Malinois are two of the most common breeds for tracking, while labradors and spaniels are typically the detection (sniffer) dogs of choice. Priddle acknowledges that sounds young, but he believes early imprinting programs can provide a strong foundation for the formal training that commences around six weeks later. “There's a lot of scientific study out there that's been documented on exposing puppies to touch, different temperatures, different surfaces and textures, as well as different odors that we put into the whelping box when they're very young,” he explained We see a lot of advancement in those puppies.” The curriculum closely follows that of the typical police or security dog, focusing on obedience, tracking, and scent detection – a skill used to sniff out rhino horn, elephant ivory and bushmeat. Typically, after 16 to 18 months, dogs are ready for assignment. Even though Priddle accompanies each one on the long flight to their new home, spending the first month with the anti-poaching unit to provide field and animal welfare training to rangers, goodbyes never get easier. “The transition from spending every waking moment with that dog, having a very strong relationship, to then letting that go is challenging and difficult,” Law said. They are particularly active forums, especially given that the organization also provides training and consultancy to teams with existing dog units, such as the Akashinga Rangers, Africa's first armed all-female anti-poaching squad, who watch over Zimbabwe's vast Phundundu Wildlife Area. Such victories demonstrate the “game-changing” value such dogs can have when incorporated into conservation efforts, argue the duo, even through their mere presence. “When these reserves bring a specialist dog onto a wildlife reserve … the word spreads very quickly that the APUs now have the capability to actually catch these poachers on a more efficient and successful basis,” Priddle said. As park manager and head of anti-poaching operations at Zimbabwe's 10,000-acre Imire conservancy, Reilly Travers has had a front row seat for the last seven years to the impact of Shinga and also Murwi, a Dutch shepherd whose training was paid for by the fundraising efforts of pupils of the local Harare International school. Capable of covering as much as 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) an hour when tracking, even in darkness, dogs allow rangers to “own the night,” Travers explained, adding an invaluable level of versatility and unpredictability to their arsenal. And on numerous occasions Shinga and Murwi have alerted units to potentially mortal threats – be it from poachers or predators – through body language alone. “They've saved our guys on the ground on several occasions and they've been responsible for apprehending quite a few poachers,” Travers told CNN. “It's had a massive impact on security for Imire. Zimbabwe once boasted thousands of rhinos, yet numbers nosedived to less than 450 by 1992 because of poaching networks, according to conservation charity Save the Rhino. Though the numbers of African rhinos poached annually has dropped steadily since a peak of over 1,300 in 2015, almost 600 kills were still recorded last year, according to Save the Rhino. It contributed to an overall decline in the total African black rhino population in 2023, though white rhino numbers are on the rise. “The owners of that reserve had a relationship with that bull for 25 years – we grieve when we lose a dog after 10 to 15 years. For us to experience the impact that losing those two rhinos had on the reserve owner sort of gave us added motivation. As Dogs4Wildlife looks ahead to its long-term goal of one day opening a specialized training and canine school within Africa, mobilizing future generations has become a key part of its overall mission. Its Conservation club, called Siyafunda Ngemvelo – which translates to “we learn in nature” in IsiZulu – has taken more than 180 South African children into reserves as part of a wildlife education program. “We have to start at the fundamental basics, which is children taking responsibility for their own wildlife,” she added.</p>

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Tuesday speech that the ongoing tariffs showdown against China is unsustainable and he expects a “de-escalation” in the trade war between the world's two largest economies. But in a private speech in Washington for JPMorgan Chase, Bessent also cautioned that talks between the United States and China had yet to formally start. Trump has placed tariffs on several dozen countries, causing the stock market to stumble and interest rates to increase on U.S. debt as investors worry about slower economic growth and higher inflationary pressures. Details of the speech were confirmed by two people familiar with the remarks who insisted on anonymity to discuss them. “I do say China is going to be a slog in terms of the negotiations,” Bessent said according to a transcript obtained by The Associated Press. “Neither side thinks the status quo is sustainable.” The S&P 500 stock index rose 2.5% after Bloomberg News initially reported Bessent's remarks. Trump acknowledged the increase in the stock market in remarks to reporters afterward on Tuesday, but he avoided confirming if he, too, thought the situation with China was unsustainable as Bessent had said behind closed doors. Despite his high tariffs, Trump said he would be “very nice” to China and not play hardball with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The Trump administration has met for talks with counterparts from Japan, India, South Korea, the European Union, Canada and Mexico, among other nations. But Trump has shown no public indications that he plans to pullback his baseline 10% tariff, even as he has insisted he's looking for other nations to cut their own import taxes and remove any non-tariff barriers that the administration says have hindered exports from the U.S. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration has received 18 proposals from other countries for trade deals with the U.S., adding that “everyone involved wants to see a trade deal happen.” Trump later said that he wanted Powell to “be early” in lowering rates and that he has no intention of firing the Fed chair, despite previously suggesting that he would.
