                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They have identified biomarkers that can indicate if someone has cancer. This discovery enables faster healthcare responses, thereby increasing the patient's chances of survival. Each year, approximately 325,000 women receive a life-altering diagnosis of gynaecological cancer. For those who develop ovarian cancer, the future is often uncertain; only half survive five years after diagnosis. When cancer is detected late, survival rates drop drastically. However, there is now a glimmer of hope. The research has made crucial progress by identifying specific biomarkers that allow for early detection of gynaecological cancer. This new discovery could eventually be integrated into healthcare, improving the chances of successful treatment. We have identified several protein variants that can help distinguish between benign and malignant tumors. Benjamin Ulfenborg, Senior Lecturer in BioInformatics, University of Skövde Cancer can hide in the body for a long time before symptoms appear, making early diagnosis challenging. The research team employs a technique combining protein analysis and genetic changes. A specific part of the research targets women with endometriosis, a chronic condition affecting about one in ten women of reproductive age. The researchers have found that certain genetic alterations are shared between endometriosis and cancer, providing new insights into which patients may be at greater risk of developing cancer later. "For these women, our research could lead to more personalised monitoring and earlier detection of potential cancer changes," says Benjamin Ulfenborg. Early cancer detection can save lives and reduce the need for extensive surgical interventions and treatments with severe side effects, granting patients more years of good health and better quality of life. "Our goal is for this method to be routinely used in healthcare. By detecting cancer at an early stage, we can prevent unnecessary suffering and give more women the opportunity to live healthier lives," adds Benjamin Ulfenborg. The project is a collaboration between several research groups. Research on early diagnosis is crucial to improving survival rates. "Every success in this field gives more women a chance to survive their disease and live longer, healthier lives," concludes Benjamin Ulfenborg.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 2016, EULAR - The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology - published recommendations on the treatment of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). Since then, new evidence has become available, so the recommendations have been reviewed and updated. FMF is an autoinflammatory disease caused by a single gene. Although it is the most common of the monogenic autoinflammatory diseases, it is still rare - resulting in low awareness around the disease for both patients and healthcare professionals, and limited knowledge about its management options. The last recommendations for FMF were published in 2016, but since then there have been new treatments developed, and new evidence collected. To address this, EULAR and PReS - the Paediatric Rheumatology European Society - have worked together to review and update the recommendations. Researchers, healthcare professionals, and patients worked together to develop this new advice. These principles emphasise that FMF has a complex clinical presentation, which requires expertise in both diagnosis and management. They also stress that the treatment goal is to achieve at least minimal activity and control of subclinical inflammation to prevent damage - and that this will require lifetime management and prophylaxis. Good adherence is therefore important for people with FMF, and patient-centred management is useful to support patients in achieving good health and well-being. The 12 new recommendations focus on key management steps, from first-line treatment with colchicine and dosing considerations through to second-line options and the biologic therapies that may be considered. Specific recommendations also deal with issues such as amyloidosis, pregnancy, symptomatic treatment during attacks, and measures of disease activity. EULAR and PReS are confident that this revised set of recommendations will support rheumatologists and other healthcare professionals in managing FMF in patients of all ages. They note that the updates highlight the need for a holistic approach and attention to compliance - but there is still much to find out about this disease, and ongoing research will help to support continued updates in the future.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hip replacement surgery, or total hip arthroplasty (THA), can lessen pain and improve function in individuals with hip osteoarthritis, but some patients continue to experience long-term physical deficits-including muscle weakness, decreased functional mobility, and increased fall risk-after the procedure. New research published in the Journal of Orthopaedic Research reveals that a patient's muscle quality before THA may predict their risk of such suboptimal recovery after surgery. In the study, 10 people undergoing THA underwent imaging tests before surgery. Patients whose imaging results indicated poor muscle quality were more likely to perform poorly on movement tasks after surgery, compared with those with good muscle quality. The severity of patients' osteoarthritis before surgery (as indicated by the imaging tests performed) was not linked to their functional abilities after surgery. The findings from this study indicate that hip muscle quality may be an important predictor of post-operative biomechanical recovery following hip replacement. Future studies will seek to understand possible implications for poor hip muscle quality on long-term functional outcomes." Halvorson, R. T., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research published in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology found that mothers who are anemic in early pregnancy face a higher likelihood of giving birth to a child with a heart defect. The study assessed the health records of 2,776 women with a child diagnosed with congenital heart disease who were matched to 13,880 women whose children did not have this condition. Investigators found that 4.4% of children with congenital heart disease and 2.8% of children with normal heart function had anemia. After adjusting for potential influencing factors, the odds of giving birth to a child with congenital heart disease was 47% higher among anemic mothers. We already know that the risk of congenital heart disease can be raised by a variety of factors, but these results develop our understanding of anemia specifically and take it from lab studies to the clinic. Knowing that early maternal anemia is so damaging could be a gamechanger worldwide. Because iron deficiency is the root cause of many cases of anemia, widespread iron supplementation for women-both when trying for a baby and when pregnant-could help prevent congenital heart disease in many newborns before it has developed."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The amino acid compound was developed at University of Michigan. This glycine-based tripeptide also stopped critical processes that lead to vascular calcification, a significant catalyst of arterial stiffening and plaque instability. Results of the study, conducted in partnership with Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, are published in Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy. Atherosclerosis and vascular calcification remain among the leading global health threats, yet current standard-of-care medications fail to effectively address them. DT-109 has demonstrated a remarkable ability to counteract the progression of atherosclerosis, an achievement that holds immense therapeutic potential." Chen's team developed DT-109 in 2019 after it was discovered that impaired glycine metabolism can cause non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In a 2023 study published in Cell Metabolism, the compound reversed fat buildup and prevented scarring in the livers of mice and nonhuman primates that had developed the most severe form of fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. NASH - renamed metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in 2023 - affects nearly 7% of the global population. The condition is strongly associated with an elevated risk of atherosclerosis, which increases the likelihood of life-threatening events like heart attack and stroke. "The emergence of DT-109 as a dual-action drug capable of treating both MASH and the vascular complications associated with atherosclerosis marks a significant advancement in the treatment landscape," said Jifeng Zhang, Ph.D., co-author and research professor of cardiovascular medicine at U-M Medical School. "There is significant demand yet limited options for effective drug therapies to treat MASH, which leaves a critical gap in medical treatments that can effectively address both liver dysfunction and its cardiovascular effects." During the 2025 study, researchers fed nonhuman primates a cholesterol-rich diet for 10 months before treating them with oral DT-109. "These results are of particular importance because they suggest that DT-109 could not only reduce atherosclerotic lesions but also prevent the vascular calcification that exacerbates arterial stiffness and plaque vulnerability in advanced atherosclerosis," Chen said. Current standard-of-care for treatment of atherosclerosis primarily involves lipid-lowering drugs, like statins and PCSK9 inhibitors, to manage cholesterol levels. Those treatments, Chen says, fail to prevent vascular calcification and the progression of atherosclerosis and leave patients at continued risk for cardiovascular events. The use of nonhuman primate models in these studies, researchers note, present a distinct advantage that could fast track evaluations of DT-109. Compared to genetically modified mice, the primates exhibit a more accurate representation of human atherosclerosis and metabolic dysfunction. "Our results in nonhuman primate models strengthens the potential for successful clinical translation, offering hope in a disease landscape currently devoid of effective treatments," Chen said. "Given its ability to reduce liver damage, modulate lipid metabolism and inhibit the inflammatory pathways driving atherosclerosis, DT-109 is positioned as a groundbreaking candidate for clinical trials, with the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce the risks associated with cardiovascular events in those with MASH." Tripeptide DT-109 (Gly-Gly-Leu) attenuates atherosclerosis and vascular calcification in nonhuman primates.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this interview, Dr. Nimesh Khadka, Senior Product Application Specialist at Thermo Fisher Scientific, explores the role of Raman spectroscopy as a process analytical tool (PAT) in bioprocess monitoring, highlighting its molecular specificity, real-time capabilities, and advantages over traditional analytical methods like ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy is a technique that examines how light interacts with molecules. When light interacts with vibrating molecules, most of it bounces unchanged – this is called a Rayleigh scattering. However, a small portion of the light shifts in energy because the molecules absorb or release small amounts of energy as they vibrate—this is known as Raman scattering. Although this scattered light is faint, it carries unique molecular fingerprints, helping scientists identify and measure different substances with precision. Raman spectroscopy offers molecular specificity, which means it can identify molecules based on their distinct spectral fingerprints. Raman can also detect multiple metabolites in a single scan without degrading samples, making it invaluable for dynamic bioprocess environments. In addition, Raman spectroscopy can detect several key protein features, including amide I, II, and III regions, which reveal details about peptide bonds and secondary structures. These insights help scientists monitor protein behavior, detect aggregation, and assess structural configurations. The speed of Raman analysis is particularly beneficial in bioprocessing. Real-time monitoring enables precise process control, such as initiating UF/DF at specific protein concentrations. It helps maintain consistent product quality, reduces costs, and saves time. Further, Raman can simultaneously monitor multiple parameters at once, enhancing understanding of bioprocess dynamics for better decision-making. UV-Vis spectroscopy can be affected by other substances in the sample, such as tryptophan, leading to inaccurate protein concentration measurements. In contrast, Raman spectroscopy is unaffected by these interferences, ensuring more reliable data. It can also quantify proteins and excipients like sucrose and histidine in a single scan, giving a more complete picture of the process. For example, we performed an experiment focused on monitoring protein concentrations during ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) in downstream monoclonal antibody production. The results showed Raman's high accuracy (less than 5% error) and showcased its ability to deliver reliable data even in the presence of interfering compounds like tryptophan. In addition, Raman spectroscopy is highly specific, detecting only the target molecules without interference from others. In our experiment, UV-Vis overestimated protein concentrations by more than 70% due to tryptophan interference. In contrast, Raman accurately measured concentrations with less than 10% error since tryptophan did not affect the Raman signals in the targeted spectral regions. Raman can be integrated into bioprocesses in three ways: in-line, at-line, or on-line. In-line uses immersible probes placed directly in the process for real-time monitoring and control. In-line Raman is most effective for continuous data collection and process control, ensuring consistent product quality. There can be challenges with Raman analysis including baseline shifts, path length differences, and spectral overlaps. Dimensionality reduction techniques like Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression help build robust chemometric models for accurate predictions. Yes, Raman goes beyond basic monitoring to support crucial bioprocess quality control, such as deconvoluting protein secondary structures and quantifying protein aggregation. Raman can isolate protein-specific spectra from excipient interference and analyze beta-sheet content or aggregation profiles in real-time, proving deeper insights into process stability and product quality. Yes, process Raman spectroscopy is a versatile tool for real-time monitoring and control in bioprocessing. Unlike traditional methods such as UV-Vis, it provides molecularly specific, non-destructive measurements, even in complex mixtures. Dr. Nimesh Khadka is a Senior Product Application Specialist at Thermo Fisher Scientific and holds a PhD in Biochemistry focusing on bioanalytical techniques. With extensive expertise in spectroscopy and chemometrics, he is committed to driving innovation through process analytical technology (PAT). Dr. Khadka is particularly passionate about addressing complex challenges in bioprocessing by leveraging advanced tools. Currently, he is at the forefront of promoting Raman spectroscopy as a practical and effective solution for monitoring and controlling bioprocesses within the realm of PAT.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New analysis shows that pairing a low-sodium diet with DASH eating habits reduces cardiovascular risk by over 14%, with the biggest wins for women and Black adults facing high blood pressure. Study: Dietary sodium reduction lowers 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score: Results from the DASH-sodium trial. In a recent article published in the American Journal of Preventive Cardiology, researchers used data collected in the United States to investigate how reducing sodium in the diet, either in isolation or while following the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, affects the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) over 10 years. Their findings indicate that adherence to DASH dietary patterns and reducing dietary sodium independently reduced the risk of ASCVD, with the greatest benefits observed when the two interventions were combined. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of mortality, but over half of the cases are linked to modifiable lifestyle factors such as physical activity and diet. Across the U.S., unhealthy dietary habits, particularly excessive sodium intake, which more than 90% of American adults exceed, are major contributors to poor cardiovascular health. The DASH diet, which is endorsed by national recommendations, encourages the intake of low-fat dairy, whole grains, vegetables, and fruits while reducing the consumption of added sugars, cholesterol, and saturated fats. It has been associated with lower CVD incidence, reduced cardiac injury, and decreased 10-year ASCVD risk. While a previous trial called DASH-Sodium showed that both the DASH diet and sodium reduction were effective in improving blood pressure, their effects on the long-term risk of ASCVD were not analyzed. In this study, researchers conducted a secondary analysis using data collected during the DASH-Sodium project to evaluate whether reducing sodium intake, alone or alongside the DASH diet, could lower the risk of ASCVD over ten years. The researchers hypothesized that decreasing sodium consumption would reduce risk alone and that combining it with DASH dietary approaches would have an additive effect. The DASH-Sodium project was a randomized, multi-center feeding study conducted between 1997 and 1999 in four U.S. clinical sites. It enrolled adults with elevated blood pressure who were at least 22 years old, while excluding those with insulin-dependent diabetes, heart disease, renal insufficiency, poorly controlled dyslipidemia, excessive alcohol intake, or those on antihypertensive medications. Each participant consumed three sodium levels—high, meaning 1.6 mg of sodium for each kilocalorie consumed (about 3,500 mg/day for a 2,000 kcal diet), medium (1.1 mg per kilocalorie, about 2,400 mg/day), or low (0.5 mg per kilocalorie, about 1,150 mg/day)—in random order. Each sodium level was consumed for about 30 days, with washout periods in between. The study provided all meals, ensuring consistent nutrient intake. Static risk factors like age and smoking were measured at baseline, while dynamic variables such as blood pressure and cholesterol were measured after each period of feeding. Data were analyzed using mixed effects models, accounting for repeated measures. Sensitivity analyses addressed participants outside the PCE's valid range by imputing or excluding out-of-range values. Stratified analyses assessed outcomes by age, sex, race, hypertension status, obesity, and smoking. It is important to note that each sodium intervention period lasted only 30 days. While this allowed for controlled measurement of short-term changes in ASCVD risk scores, it does not provide evidence about the long-term impact of sustained dietary changes. Among 390 participants, baseline characteristics were similar across the control and DASH diet groups. The DASH diet led to a greater reduction in the estimated ASCVD risk over ten years compared to the control diet, with an absolute difference of −0.12% and a relative difference of −5.33%. Combined DASH diet and low sodium intake resulted in the largest decrease in ASCVD risk, with an absolute difference of −0.35%, and a relative difference of −14.09% compared to the control diet, which was high in sodium. Stratified analysis showed stronger sodium reduction effects in women, Black adults, and those with stage 2 hypertension, while no significant differences were seen by age, obesity, or smoking status. The study also noted that race was dichotomized as Black versus non-Black, so effects among other minoritized groups could not be determined. These results align with previous evidence supporting DASH and sodium reduction for cardiovascular health. However, no long-term randomized trials have confirmed DASH's effect on actual CVD events, as most evidence is based on risk factor and risk score reduction, not direct clinical outcomes. The optimal sodium intake level also remains debated. Future research should focus on long-term outcomes, include a broader range of participants, and further refine sodium intake guidelines.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A sweeping global review shows that the Mediterranean diet significantly reduces breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women, with Asian populations seeing the strongest effects, highlighting the diet's potential as a strategic prevention tool. Review: Adherence to Mediterranean Diet and Breast Cancer Risk: A Meta-Analysis of Prospective Observational Studies. In a recent study published in the journal Health Science Reports, researchers evaluated the associations between adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) and breast cancer risk. Breast cancer is a significant public health concern, accounting for a substantial proportion of cancer diagnoses among women. The MD has drawn substantial research interest due to its associations with health benefits. Moreover, studies suggest an inverse relationship between adherence to the MD and breast cancer risk, albeit some inconsistencies remain. First, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for case-control and cohort studies examining adherence to the MD and its association with breast cancer risk. They also reported risk estimates using odds, relative, or hazard ratios. Studies that lacked quantitative data, non-original studies (e.g., reviews), and those involving other dietary patterns were excluded. Next, relevant data from studies were extracted; these included sample size, participant characteristics (age, menopausal status), dietary assessment methods and duration, alcohol intake, and risk estimates. Further, the meta-analysis was performed by pooling risk estimates comparing the lowest and highest levels of MD adherence. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I-squared statistic, and publication bias was examined using Funnel plots and Begg's test. In addition, the team performed subgroup analyses by study design, regions, and menopausal status to analyze whether these variables modified risk estimates. The researchers also conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of their findings and examined the impact of adjusting for alcohol consumption, an element of the Mediterranean diet whose role in breast cancer risk is debated. Following deduplication and title/abstract screening, full texts of 43 studies were reviewed, resulting in the inclusion of 31 studies. The quality of included studies was generally high, with case-control and cohort studies scoring 3–9 and 6–9 on the NOS, respectively. The meta-analysis indicated a significant association between MD adherence and lower breast cancer risk overall, with substantial heterogeneity across studies. However, for premenopausal women, there was no significant risk reduction, with some heterogeneity across studies. By contrast, for postmenopausal women, there was a significant decrease in breast cancer risk associated with adherence to the MD, with moderate heterogeneity. Further, cohort studies with less than and over 20 years of follow-up showed no significant differences in breast cancer risk. By geographical region, studies performed in Asia showed the strongest associations between MD adherence and breast cancer risk. For premenopausal women in cohort studies, the MD had no effect on breast cancer risk; likewise, the marginal association in case-control studies appeared overestimated. By region, premenopausal women had no significant risk reduction across Asia, the Americas, or Europe. For postmenopausal women in cohort studies, there was a modest decrease in breast cancer risk associated with MD adherence, while a stronger protective effect was noted in case-control studies. The analysis also found that including or excluding alcohol as a component of the Mediterranean diet influenced the magnitude of risk reduction in some subgroups, especially among postmenopausal women, highlighting the complex and still-debated role of alcohol in breast cancer prevention. Limitations of the study include differences in findings between cohort and case-control studies, with case-control studies generally showing a stronger association but also having a higher risk of recall bias and other methodological challenges. Additionally, variations in how the Mediterranean diet is defined and implemented across different regions—often due to cultural factors—may have contributed to inconsistent results. The authors note that further research should consider breast cancer subtypes, hormone receptor status, genetic predispositions, and lifestyle factors to more fully understand the potential protective role of the Mediterranean diet. There were no significant effects for premenopausal women. Geographically, Asian populations had the strongest protective effects, with moderate associations in Europeans and Americans. While these results suggest that the MD may be a promising diet to prevent breast cancer, the authors emphasize the need for additional, well-designed studies across diverse populations and regions, and taking into account the complexity of diet composition and other risk factors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Telemedicine use in 2023 reduced monthly carbon dioxide emissions by the equivalent of up to 130,000 gas operated vehicles, suggesting it could have a positive effect on climate change, new UCLA-led research finds. The findings, to be published April 22 in the peer-reviewed American Journal of Managed Care, suggest that telemedicine could have a modest but noticeable impact on the environment by decreasing the number of vehicles traveling to and from medical appointments. They could also have policy implications, said co-senior author Dr. John N. Mafi, associate professor-in-residence of medicine in the division of general internal medicine and health services research at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. As Congress debates whether to extend or modify pandemic-era telehealth flexibilities, our results provide important evidence for policymakers to consider, namely that telemedicine has the potential to reduce the carbon footprint of US health care delivery." The researchers used de-identified data from the Milliman MedInsight Emerging Experience database to quantify nearly 1.5 million telemedicine visits, including about 66,000 in rural areas, during the April 1 through June 30, 2023 study period. They estimated that between 741,000 and 1.35 million of those were substitutes for in-person visits. Extrapolating from these calculations, the researchers estimate that CO2 emissions were reduced by between 21.4 million and 47.6 million kg each month in the U.S. due to telemedicine use, which translates to the amount produced by 61,000 to 130,000 gas powered vehicles or recycling 1.8 million to 4 million trash bags. "Our findings suggest that the environmental impact of medical care delivery can be reduced when lower-carbon options, such as telemedicine, are substituted for other services that produce more emissions." The researchers note some limitations to their findings. Their sampling method was based on data that was from a single, easy to access source rather than a random selection, so the findings may not represent the broader population or account for regional variations. Also, driving distances and vehicle market share were based on data sources from before 2023, though driving distances to in-person care were not likely to differ much from what they were prior to that year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Radiopharmaceutical company AdvanCell has received $18 million from the Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) to develop and deliver targeted alpha therapies for prostate cancer, which is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men. UQ's expertise in imaging and diagnostics will help AdvanCell progress a promising new class of treatment which delivers highly potent alpha radiation directly to cancer cells while minimising harm to healthy tissue. AdvanCell Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Anna Karmann said our MRFF funded research will accelerate the development and translation of promising targeted alpha therapy combinations. By partnering with outstanding researchers at UQ, and leading clinical investigators, we leverage novel tools and technologies combined with innovative clinical approaches to advance precision patient care and improve clinical outcomes for men with prostate cancer." At UQ's Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN) researchers will contribute to key areas to inform how, when and where these new therapies are delivered to patients, and their impact on tissues in the body. Deputy Director Professor Kristofer Thurecht said AIBN's role was to help develop strategies that show how radiation affects cancer cells and design new diagnostic tools that reveal how a patient's immune system is responding to treatment. "This will enable AdvanCell to identify suitable patients for clinical trials, monitor how well the therapy is working, and adjust treatment strategies in real time as needed," Professor Thurecht said. "Ultimately, this will make targeted alpha therapy more precise and effective." At UQ's Centre for Clinical Research, Dr Kevin Koo's lab is analysing patient samples in collaboration with AdvanCell to uncover why some prostate cancer patients respond better to treatment than others. "Every patient and tumour is different, which is why we're trying to understand why some respond exceptionally well to targeted alpha therapy," Dr Koo said. "This knowledge will help clinicians personalise therapies and improve outcomes." Head of AdvanCell's Translational Medicine and Clinical Science, Professor Stephen Rose, said the funding was an important step for Australian innovation to improve the lives of men with prostate cancer. "Our multidisciplinary multi-institutional approach is key to defeating prostate cancer."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A powerful clinical artificial intelligence tool developed by University at Buffalo biomedical informatics researchers has demonstrated remarkable accuracy on all three parts of the United States Medical Licensing Exam (Step exams), according to a paper published today (April 22) in JAMA Network Open. Achieving higher scores on the USMLE than most physicians and all other AI tools so far, Semantic Clinical Artificial Intelligence (SCAI, pronounced "Sky") has the potential to become a critical partner for physicians, says lead author Peter L. Elkin, MD, chair of the Department of Biomedical Informatics in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB and a physician with UBMD Internal Medicine. As physicians, we are used to using computers as tools, but SCAI is different; it can add to your decision-making and thinking based on its own reasoning." Any questions with a visual component were eliminated. Elkin explains that most AI tools function by using statistics to find associations in online data that allow them to answer a question. "We call these tools generative artificial intelligence," he says. "Some have postulated that they are just plagiarizing what's on the internet because the answers they give you are what others have written." However, these AI models are now becoming partners in care rather than simple tools for clinicians to utilize in their practice, he says. "But SCAI answers more complex questions and performs more complex semantic reasoning," he says, "We have created knowledge sources that can reason more the way people learn to reason while doing their training in medical school." The team started with a natural language processing software they had previously developed. They added vast amounts of authoritative clinical information gleaned from widely disparate sources ranging from recent medical literature and clinical guidelines to genomic data, drug information, discharge recommendations, patient safety data and more. Any data that might be biased, such as clinical notes, were not included. The team used basic clinical facts known as semantic triples (subject-relation-object, such as "Penicillin treats pneumococcal pneumonia") to create semantic networks. The tool can then represent these semantic networks so that it is possible to draw logical inferences from them. "We have taught large language models how to use semantic reasoning," says Elkin. Other techniques that contributed to SCAI include knowledge graphs that are designed to find new links in medical data as well as previously "hidden" patterns, as well as retrieval-augmented generation, which allows the large language model to access and incorporate information from external knowledge databases before responding to a prompt. "SCAI is different from other large language models because it can have a conversation with you and as a human-computer partnership can add to your decision-making and thinking based on its own reasoning," Elkin says. He concludes: "By adding semantics to large language models, we are providing them with the ability to reason similarly to the way we do when practicing evidence-based medicine." Because it can access such vast amounts of data, SCAI also has the potential to improve patient safety, improve access to care and "democratize specialty care," Elkin says, by making medical information on specialties and subspecialties accessible to primary care providers and even to patients. While the power of SCAI is impressive, Elkin stresses its role will be to augment, not replace, physicians. "Artificial intelligence isn't going to replace doctors," he says, "but a doctor who uses AI may replace a doctor who does not."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study led by the University of Zurich has shown that evidence of genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia can be found in the retina. In their study, the researchers examined whether changes in our nerve connections are linked to a genetic risk for schizophrenia, as impaired neural information processing is one of the main characteristics of the disorder. Previous studies suggest that schizophrenia not only reduces volume of gray matter in the brains of those affected, but that it also leads to loss of retinal tissue. However, whether these changes are the cause of schizophrenia or a consequence of the disorder has remained unanswered. Retinal health could also be affected by schizophrenia itself, for example through antipsychotic medication, lifestyle factors or diabetes. We then calculated polygenic risk scores for each individual." The researchers were able to use extensive genetic and retinal data taken from the UK Biobank, a large biomedical database containing data from over half a million people. The study shows that higher genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia is indeed associated with thinner retinas. However, the effects are small and can only be reliably demonstrated in large-scale studies. One of the study's findings is that, unlike changes in the brain, changes in the retina are easy to detect using non-invasive and inexpensive retinal measurements. Thanks to optical coherence tomography, which can be described as a kind of ultrasound for the eye, retinal thickness can be measured within a matter of minutes. This offers a promising outlook for prevention. "Our study shows the potential of using optical coherence tomography in clinical practice. But large-scale longitudinal studies are needed to examine how useful it will be for prevention," says Finn Rabe. Another key finding of the study concerns genetic variants associated with inflammatory processes in the brain. These may also contribute to structural changes in the retina. "If this hypothesis is confirmed, inflammation could be interrupted by medication, potentially enabling us to improve treatment possibilities in the future," says Rabe.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PCR genetic analysis has been in the spotlight since COVID-19, but light is now further facilitating PCR-free methods. Osaka Metropolitan University scientists have developed a light-induced DNA detection technique, using heterogeneous probe particles, that enables ultra-sensitive and ultra-fast genetic analysis without the need for PCR amplification. This advancement is lighting the way for faster, more affordable, and precise genetic analysis across medicine, environmental science, and portable diagnostics. As a means of analyzing changes in DNA, genetic testing - which is essential for diagnosing infectious diseases, detecting early-stage cancer, verifying food safety, and analyzing environmental DNA - has long relied on PCR (polymerase chain reaction) as the gold standard. But as those of us who have experienced them know, PCR tests are neither cheap nor fast; they typically require centralized labs, bulky equipment, and specially trained personnel. "Our light-induced method detects DNA without the need for PCR," write Shuichi Toyouchi, a Project Lecturer, Prof. Shiho Tokonami, the Deputy Director, and Takuya Iida, the Director at Osaka Metropolitan University's Research Institute for Light-induced Acceleration System (RILACS), as the lead authors of this study. Unlike PCR, which amplifies DNA sequences by making millions of copies of target DNA for detection, this method directly detects DNA by concentrating it and enhancing specificity through strong optical forces and photothermal effect. The team developed a system using heterogeneous probe particles, including gold nanoparticles and polystyrene microparticles. These probes are short, known DNA sequences designed to hybridize, or bind, with complementary sequences in the target DNA. This process, known as DNA hybridization, allows the matching strands to bind together, making the pairing detectable through fluorescence. The gold nanoparticles absorb laser light, creating localized heat, or photothermal effect, to further enhance the hybridization specificity. "Using just about five minutes of laser light irradiation, our method demonstrated great potential for accurate mutation detection with a sensitivity one order of magnitude higher than that of digital PCR.," Toyouchi, Tokonami, and Iida write. By eliminating the need for PCR amplification, this method reduces costs, simplifies testing, and accelerates results, making genetic analysis more accessible in daily life applications - from healthcare and food safety to environmental conservation and personal health tracking. "We aim to apply this PCR-free technology to high-sensitivity cancer diagnostics, quantum life science research, and even at-home or environmental DNA testing," Iida said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lead author, registered psychologist and PhD candidate Melanie Deek, says the study found that while both groups of women shared similar levels of body dissatisfaction, Middle-Eastern women reported higher body appreciation compared to their Western counterparts. Our findings challenge commonly held assumptions that negative body image is universally experienced in the same way. Middle-Eastern women, in particular, showed stronger body appreciation, which may reflect cultural values and close family relationships that promote self-acceptance. This suggests that family and cultural values in the Middle East may help foster a more positive view of one's body, which could serve as a potential protective factor for negative body-image and disordered eating behaviors." Melanie Deek, lead author, registered psychologist and PhD candidate from the College of Education, Psychology and Social Work "Mothers, more than sisters, were found to have a consistently stronger impact when it came to shaping eating behaviors and body image," Ms. Deek explains. "Interestingly, while Middle-Eastern women reported more frequent 'fat talk'-discussions about weight and appearance-within families, these conversations were linked to positive outcomes, like increased body appreciation-suggesting a more nuanced cultural dynamic." The study also found differences in eating behaviors, with Middle-Eastern women more likely to engage in mindful eating practices, such as eating without distractions-habits associated with better mental and physical health. "Their focus on mindful eating may contribute not only to healthier eating habits but also to a more positive body image," says Deek. Senior researcher Professor Ivanka Prichard, a body image expert, says the findings challenge the assumption that body image concerns are largely Western. "Western beauty ideals are spreading globally, but this study shows that cultural and familial factors still play a powerful role in shaping how young women see themselves," Professor Prichard says. "To effectively address body dissatisfaction and disordered eating, we must develop culturally tailored interventions-not one-size-fits-all solutions." The research team plans to expand the study to include more Middle-Eastern regions, especially areas less influenced by Western beauty norms, and explore how these findings translate in multicultural societies like Australia. "Our work underscores the need for inclusive, culturally sensitive approaches to promote positive body image and healthy eating behaviors across the globe," concludes Ms. Deek.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>University of Michigan researchers have found that certain psychedelic compounds improve the brain's ability to adapt and flexibly learn new concepts over long periods. This kind of cognitive flexibility is impaired in many psychiatric and neurological conditions. “Psychedelic compounds are being tested in ongoing clinical trials attempting to treat depression and PTSD,” said Omar Ahmed, U-M associate professor of psychology and senior author of the newly published study. We find that a single psychedelic dose can boost flexible learning over several weeks in mice, highlighting the ability of these compounds to induce long-lasting and functionally important changes to the brain.” The team discovered that one dose of the psychedelic compound 25CN-NBOH helped mice think more flexibly and do better in behavioral tests even weeks after drug administration. This research, which appeared in the journal Psychedelics, highlights why clinical trials of psychedelic drugs may benefit people living with depression or PTSD. Clinical trial designs for depression use only one or two doses. Our results show, in mouse models, that even a single dose of a psychedelic can result in lasting benefits. We studied flexible learning up to three weeks after the single dose and saw improvements. Elizabeth Brouns, U-M psychology master's student and study's first author These serotonin 2a receptors are also considered to be responsible for the therapeutic benefits of psychedelic treatments,” according to study co-author Tyler Ekins, U-M postdoctoral fellow in psychology. The mice were introduced to an automated training device called the FED3, which gave them food pellets as rewards for poking their noses into distinct holes in the correct sequence. Both male and female mice treated with the psychedelic learned this new rule more quickly than mice given control injections, even three weeks after the psychedelic was first administered. This automated task design, developed by the team, marks an advance in how scientists study flexible learning over long durations. Despite the findings, Ahmed cautions that many questions remain. Psychedelic medicine is still in its infancy but progressing quickly, he said. “A lot of fundamental, basic science and translational research is needed to ensure that clinical trials utilize optimal versions and doses of psychedelic drugs,” Ahmed said. One key question is what happens with two, three or even 20 doses taken over several months. Is every additional dose increasingly beneficial for flexible learning, or is there a plateau effect or even a negative effect of too many doses? These are important questions to answer next in the quest to make psychedelic medicine more rational and mechanistic, he said. Brouns, E. J., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers reveal that many children's mattresses release high levels of hazardous chemicals during sleep, raising fresh concerns about everyday exposure in early life. Study: Are Sleeping Children Exposed to Plasticizers, Flame Retardants, and UV-Filters from Their Mattresses? Infants and children up to four years of age spend an average of 18 hours every day in their SME, which may consist of mattresses, pillows, toys, bedding materials, and the air surrounding their immediate sleeping area. Previous studies have reported that SMEs often contain harmful chemicals, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs), and biological contaminants, including mites, bacteria, and fungi. Recently, SVOCs, such as stain repellents, plasticizers, and flame retardants, have been detected in many mattresses. Since SVOC additives are not chemically attached to mattress materials, they have the potential to contaminate the surrounding air, clothing, dust, toys, and skin surfaces. This migration of SVOCs, which are high-fugacity materials, may occur due to their passive diffusion to a lower fugacity, thereby achieving chemical equilibrium. Children's movements through shifting positions while sleeping or bouncing on a mattress also accelerate SVOC migration, which subsequently increases exposure to these harmful chemicals. In fact, previous studies have estimated that the SVOC inhalation rate among children is 10 times higher than that of adults. In addition to inhalation and dermal exposure from sleeping on mattresses for prolonged periods, frequent hand-to-mouth and mouthing activities by children also increase their susceptibility to SVOC exposure. Children's exposure to certain SVOCs, such as ortho-phthalates (PAEs) and certain organophosphate esters (OPEs), increases the risk of allergic diseases like asthma. These chemicals can also trigger adverse neurobehavioral outcomes, including effects on cognitive ability, prosocial behavior, and working memory. Several countries, including Canada, have begun enforcing regulations to limit the use of some SVOCs, including benzyl butyl phthalate (BzBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), in mattresses and toys. Canada and the United States have also banned the use of foam-based products, including tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCiPP) and tris(chloropropyl) phosphate (TCPP), in mattresses intended for children three years of age and younger. In the current study, a total of 16 new, low-cost, and varied certified children's mattresses (M1-M16) were purchased from major North American retailers. All mattresses were evaluated for the presence of selected SVOCs, with compliance to Canadian regulations. PAEs, such as DBP, BzBP, and DEHP, were also measured to ensure that these mattresses adhered to safety limits set by U.S. regulations for children's products, including their mattresses. A total of 45 analytes were tested, including OPEs, PAEs, BPs, and 5 SALs. All experiments were conducted at the University of Toronto. Of the 45 test analytes, 21 were detected in 16 mattresses with detection frequencies (DFs) of 88% for tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) and 6.3% for TCEP, methyl salicylate (M-SAL), and tris (2-isopropyl phenyl) phosphate (T2IPPP). No association was established between the total number of SVOCs detected in covers and foam and the mattress cost. Likewise, no relationship was observed between total SVOC concentrations and the type of polymer used in the cover, such as flexible polypropylene (PP), rigid polyvinyl chloride (PVC), or polyethylene (PE) copolymer. SVOCs were consistently found in the mattresses' foam and cover, thus indicating that these materials may function as the primary source of contamination. While high levels of BPs, PAEs, and SALs were detected in the covers, all tested OPEs were found at higher concentrations in the foam, except for TBOEP. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis revealed that mattress covers and foams are rich sources of TCEP and TCPPs, which can potentially migrate into the cover materials. Several mattress covers contained DiBP and DiNP concentrations exceeding the permitted levels in Canada. Thus, children's body heat and weight increase SVOC emissions, and as a result, their exposure to these harmful chemicals increases. The researchers estimated that children would be exposed to at least seven SVOCs detected in the mattress sampler and SME air samplers. In SME, the highest air concentrations were for BzBP, followed by DnBP. Nevertheless, additional studies using larger sample sizes are needed to validate these findings.
