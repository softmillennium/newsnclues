Experts have said that Israel's withholding and targeting of humanitarian aid amount to genocidal acts.

Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and top Republican leaders at Mar-a-Lago agreed in a meeting that Israel should continue bombing humanitarian aid in Gaza, Ben-Gvir has said — effectively admitting that he is getting express support from top U.S. leaders to commit what experts have deemed as war crimes and genocidal acts.

Ben-Gvir is visiting the U.S. this week for the first time as minister. On Tuesday, he attended a dinner with senior Republican Party members, including GOP House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (Indiana), at the Donald Trump-owned estate. 

“I had the honor and privilege of meeting with senior members of the Republican Party at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate,” Ben-Gvir wrote in a post on social media early Wednesday morning. 

“They expressed support for my clear stance on how action should be taken in Gaza — that food and aid depots should be bombed to create military and political pressure to bring our hostages home,” he said.

Targeting humanitarian aid and relief workers without a legitimate military target is a war crime. Israel's campaign of withholding and attacking humanitarian aid efforts has been so horrific that its actions have been deemed not just violations of international law, but also genocidal acts by international law experts.

The humanitarian catastrophe that Israel has created in Gaza is currently reaching new depths, aid groups say, with Israel having blocked all aid from entering Gaza for over 50 days now. The UN has said that the crisis is at “unprecedented levels,” with all 2 million Palestinians in Gaza “trapped, starving and desperate,” with food, water, medicine, and all other essential supplies rapidly running out.

“Hunger is spreading and deepening, deliberate and manmade. Gaza has become a land of desperation. Two million people — a majority of women and children — are undergoing collective punishment,” said UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) head Philippe Lazzarini in a statement this week. “Humanitarian aid is being used as a bargaining chip and a weapon of war.”

Yet, Ben-Gvir and top Republicans reportedly believe that Israel should bomb what few supplies there are left in Gaza, in a seeming effort to accelerate Israel's extermination campaign. Ben-Gvir has repeatedly called for Israel to resettle Gaza, a genocidal plan supported by President Donald Trump and his administration.

The Trump administration is openly embracing violators of human rights. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced that he is eliminating an office whose stated mission is to advance human rights across the world, while the State Department is also eliminating condemnations of human rights violations from its annual reports, including denunciations of poor prison conditions.

At the meeting with GOP leaders, as well as dozens of business men from Miami, Ben-Gvir boasted about eroding conditions in Israel's torture camps, where Palestinians are tortured to death, among other abuses. 

While in southern Florida, Ben-Gvir also visited a police station, a prison and a Jewish-owned gun store.

On Wednesday, Ben-Gvir is slated to speak at Yale University, where students last week erected a Gaza solidarity encampment to protest his visit. Organizers disbanded the encampment on Tuesday night after threats of “retribution” from the university administration, with 200 protesters having gathered.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

Key developments on April 23:

U.S. Vice President JD Vance said on April 23 that the U.S. presented a "very explicit proposal" to Russia and Ukraine on a peace deal, repeating warnings Washington might drop its peace effort if the belligerent sides refuse.

Talking to journalists during a visit to India, Vance said that it is time for Kyiv and Moscow "to either say yes or for the United States to walk away from this process."

"We have engaged in an extraordinary amount of diplomacy and on-the-ground work. We really tried to understand things from the perspectives of both Ukrainians and Russians," he said. "I think that we put together a very fair proposal."

Vance added that "it's now time to take, if not the final step, one of the final steps"— with all parties agreeing to stop the fighting, freeze territorial lines "at some level close to where they are," and pursue a long-term diplomatic settlement.

The U.S. vice president also said that the two sides would have to give up some of the territory they control. Vance noted that eventual borders may not exactly follow the current front line but stressed it is currently necessary to lay down arms and "freeze" the war.

Following Vance's remarks, a spokesperson for Downing Street told AFP on April 23: "We support U.S.-led efforts to bring about a lasting end to the war. I think that is what we all want. Ultimately, it must be for Ukraine to decide its future."

The comments follow reporting that the U.S. is ready to recognize Russia's de jure control over Crimea and de facto control over occupied territories in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts as part of a peace deal.

Moscow occupies roughly 20% of Ukraine's sovereign territory. This includes Crimea and parts of the Donbas region occupied in 2014, and additional territories taken after the start of the full-scale war in 2022.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected the possibility of recognizing Russian hold over Crimea.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said his country will abandon the ceasefire effort in the coming days unless progress is made.

Earlier, a source close to French President Emmanuel Macron told AFP that "respect for Ukraine's territorial integrity and its European aspirations are very strong demands of the Europeans."

The source added that while French, British, and German officials were meeting with American and Ukrainian envoys in London for ceasefire talks, "the objective remains to build a common approach that the United States could present to the Russians."

A Ukrainian delegation met with European officials and U.S. Special Envoy Keith Kellogg in London on April 23 to continue discussions on a possible path to peace, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a statement on X.

"During our meeting with U.S. Special Envoy General Keith Kellogg, we had a constructive exchange of views on the path to peace," Sybiha wrote. "Ukraine wants the war to end more than anyone else in the world. We are committed to working together to achieve this goal."

The London meeting, originally intended as a ministerial-level summit involving the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, and Ukraine, was notably downgraded after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff declined to participate.

According to Reuters, Rubio pulled out after Ukraine submitted a document to European partners on April 22 declaring it would not enter talks on territorial issues until Russia agrees to a "full and unconditional ceasefire."

Following the meetings in London, Ukrainian Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak reiterated Kyiv's position, saying, "An immediate, complete and unconditional ceasefire should be the first step towards the start of negotiations on achieving a just and lasting peace."

Yermak also emphasized that Ukraine would defend its "principled positions," which form the basis of its sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Despite the absence of Rubio and Witkoff, the U.K. Foreign Ministry said "significant progress was made on reaching a common position," and that all parties reaffirmed support for U.S. President Donald Trump's stated commitment to achieving a just and lasting peace.

The meeting followed a summit in Paris on April 17, where senior Trump administration officials outlined a controversial peace proposal to Ukrainian and European delegates.

The plan reportedly includes recognition of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and a ban on Ukraine's NATO membership — two central demands by the Kremlin.

President Donald Trump claimed in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, that the U.S. is not forcing Ukraine to recognize Crimea as Russian, following reports that a U.S. peace plan includes the U.S. formally recognizing Moscow's illegal annexation of Crimea.

"Nobody is asking (President Volodymyr) Zelensky to recognize Crimea as Russian Territory, but if he wants Crimea, why didn't they fight for it eleven years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?" Trump wrote on April 23.

Trump's remarks come one day after President Volodymyr Zelensky reaffirmed that Ukraine would never legally recognize Russia's control of Crimea.

"There is nothing to talk about. This violates our Constitution. This is our territory, the territory of the people of Ukraine," Zelensky said at a briefing in Kyiv on April 22.

In response, Trump called Zelensky's position "harmful to the peace negotiations with Russia," claiming that Crimea "was lost years ago under the auspices of President Barack Hussein Obama, and is not even a point of discussion."

The claim that Crimea was taken without force is false. During Russia's 2014 annexation, armed Russian troops in unmarked uniforms seized Ukrainian government buildings, military installations, and blockaded bases.

At least one Ukrainian serviceman was killed, and dozens were detained or assaulted. The operation, widely condemned by the international community, violated international law.

Trump also argued that "even before the annexation of Crimea, major Russian submarine bases" were present there, and accused Zelensky of inflaming tensions with rhetoric that complicates peace efforts.

"He can have peace, or he can fight for another three years before losing the whole country," Trump wrote. "I have nothing to do with Russia, but have much to do with wanting to save, on average, five thousand Russian and Ukrainian soldiers a week, who are dying for no reason whatsoever."

Despite expressing frustration over Russia's refusal to de-escalate the war, the U.S. president has so far avoided imposing any major sanctions or taking punitive action against Moscow for its invasion.

While Trump appeared to frame the proposal as something Ukraine could reject, he notably did not deny that the U.S. might move forward with formally recognizing Crimea as Russian territory, something Russia had wanted for years.

Recognition of the annexation would contradict a decade of bipartisan U.S. policy and a 2014 United Nations General Assembly resolution, in which 100 member states declared the seizure illegal.

On April 22, Refat Chubarov, chairman of the Mejlis, the representative body of the indigenous Crimean Tatar people, firmly rejected any international recognition of Crimea as Russian territory.

"Crimea is the homeland of the indigenous Crimean Tatar people and an integral part of Ukraine," Chubarov wrote. "Accordingly, no one can decide the fate of Crimea under any circumstances, except for the Ukrainian state and the Crimean Tatar people."

Since 2014, Moscow has used intimidation, religious profiling, and politically motivated terrorism charges to suppress dissent among Crimean Tatars. The Mejlis' stance, Chubarov said, is grounded in international law and fully aligned with the Ukrainian Constitution.

China's Foreign Ministry on April 23 accused Ukraine of making "groundless" accusations after the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry summoned a Chinese ambassador to present evidence of Chinese involvement in Russia's war.

A day earlier, Chinese Ambassador to Ukraine Ma Shengkun was invited to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry to meet with Deputy Foreign Minister Yevhen Perebyinis.

Perebyinis presented the Chinese ambassador with evidence of Chinese citizens' participation in hostilities against Ukraine on Russia's side and the involvement of Chinese companies in the production of military products in Russia.

The evidence was also passed on to the Chinese side by the Ukrainian security services.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry called Ukraine's recent statements "groundless" and "political manipulations."

"We have clarified China's position on the relevant issues. China strongly opposes groundless accusations and political manipulations," Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said during a press briefing.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on April 17 that China is supplying weapons to Russia, marking Kyiv's first confirmation that Beijing supports Russia's war effort by direct military aid. Iran and North Korea are two other allies of Moscow that supply Russia with arms.

Though Beijing has long denied supplying arms, multiple reports have suggested otherwise. In summer 2024, Zelensky said China had assured Ukraine it would not deliver weapons to Russia.

While officially claiming neutrality, Beijing has deepened economic ties with Moscow, supported Russia against Western sanctions, and emerged as a top supplier of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense sector.

Earlier this month, Ukrainian forces captured two Chinese nationals fighting for Russia in Donetsk Oblast. Zelensky later said that "several hundred" Chinese nationals were fighting on Russia's side.

China has denied any direct involvement in the war and claimed it has urged its citizens to avoid armed conflicts.

Ukraine's military said on April 23 that it struck a Russian facility producing combat drones located more than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) from Ukraine's border.

Independent news channel Astra reported earlier in the day that a Ukrainian long-range drone strike had targeted Alabuga, sharing purported footage of a drone being shot down.

The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that Russian air defenses shot down one Ukrainian airplane-type drone in Tatarstan at about 12:20 p.m. local time, without providing further details or mentioning Alabuga.

The strike, carried out by Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces in coordination with other branches of the military, targeted a plant in the Alabuga Special Economic Zone of Russia's Republic of Tatarstan, the General Staff said.

The facility that was hit manufactures up to 300 Iranian-style Shahed drones and their Russian-made variants, Gerans, per day, according to the General Staff. Shahed-style drones are frequently used by Russia in attacks on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.

The attack is among Ukraine's deepest strikes into Russian territory since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. Ukraine hit targets over 1,000 kilometers last year for the first time, with one attack occurring 1,800 kilometers (1,118 miles) from the border in Russia's Murmansk Oblast.

The General Staff said that there were "confirmed hits and explosions in the target area," and that the damage to the facility as a result of the attack was still being assessed.

“The strike is a justified response against a strategic military site used to support Russia's aggression and terror against Ukraine and Ukrainian civilians," the General Staff statement read.

Over 6,000 Shahed-type drones were produced in Alabuga last year, as well as thousands of decoy drones used to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses, said Andrii Kovalenko, an official at Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council.

Russian forces launch hundreds of drones nearly every night at Ukraine, targeting civilian areas and critical infrastructure. The attacks have intensified in recent months as Moscow continues to reject a U.S.-backed proposal for a 30-day ceasefire, which Kyiv says must include a halt to attacks on civilian infrastructure.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has urged a temporary freeze on long-range drone and missile strikes, but Kremlin officials have dismissed the idea.

            President Donald Trump slammed Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday for his comments that Ukraine wouldn't recognize Russian control of Crimea, calling the remarks “very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia.”
    


            “It's inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy's that makes it so difficult to settle this War. He has nothing to boast about! The situation for Ukraine is dire — He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country,” he posted on Truth Social.
    


            His comments came a few hours after a meeting in London aimed at bringing about an end to Russia's war in Ukraine had been downgraded after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he wouldn't attend.
    


            Rubio had been expected to take part in the discussions with Ukrainian, UK and European officials, but State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Tuesday that he would no longer attend due to “logistical issues,” though a US official and two European diplomats familiar with the matter said the top US diplomat didn't go because the administration did not feel that they were at a decisive point in the ongoing talks and Rubio didn't feel attending would be the best use of his time.
    


            “It was better to let talks play out than create the illusion that a breakthrough was imminent,” said one of the European diplomats.
    


            Britain's Foreign Office confirmed on Wednesday that the meeting would take place at a lower level. “Official level talks will continue but these are closed to media,” the department said in a message to journalists.
    


            The developments throw new uncertainty over the diplomatic efforts to end Russia's war. The United States has become increasingly steadfast in its push to force Kyiv to an agreement, but Ukraine is adamant that it will not give up Crimea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014, or parts of eastern Ukraine that were captured following Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022.
    


            US Vice President JD Vance threatened to abandon negotiations on Wednesday, telling reporters during a visit to India: “We've issued a very explicit proposal to both the Russians and Ukrainians, and it's time for them to either say yes or for the US to walk away from this process. We've engaged in an extraordinary amount of diplomacy, of on the ground work.”

            But Ukraine's European allies, particularly Britain and France, have been hoping to bridge the divide. Wednesday's talks were due to follow a meeting in Paris last week in which officials from the US, the United Kingdom, France and Germany discussed the American framework for a ceasefire.
    


            After Rubio reversed plans to attend the latest talks, Bruce said President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, would represent the US in London instead.
    


            Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Russia on Friday, a US official said.
    


            The US proposal that has caused deadlock includes recognizing Russia's control of Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula illegally annexed by Moscow, an official familiar with the framework told CNN. It would also put a ceasefire in place along the front lines of the war, the official said.
    


            Any move to recognize Russia's control of Crimea would reverse a decade of US policy.
    


            Zelensky made clear Tuesday that he was open to talks with Russia, but that Kyiv would not accept a deal that recognizes Moscow's control of Crimea.
    


            “Ukraine will not legally recognize the occupation of Crimea,” he told reporters. “There is nothing to talk about. It is against our constitution.”
    


            Asked to clarify about whether he meant the US wanted to freeze the territorial lines where they are, Vance said Wednesday, “No, I didn't say that. What I said is the current line, somewhere close to them is where you're ultimately, I think, going to draw the new lines in the conflict. Now of course, that means the Ukrainians and the Russians are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own. There's gonna have to be some territorial swaps.”
    


            Meanwhile, the war has resumed with full force this week, following a surprise ceasefire over the Easter weekend that both sides accused each other of breaching.
    


            On Wednesday, Ukrainian authorities said nine people were killed and at least 30 wounded when a Russian drone struck a bus carrying people to work near the city of Marhanets in the Dnipropetrovsk region.
    


            Russia's National Guard said it destroyed 17 Ukrainian attack drones overnight, state-run news agency Tass reported on Wednesday.
    


            The talks in London were scheduled as US officials publicly voiced frustration over the lack of progress at bringing an end to the war.
    


            Trump has said he would “have to see an enthusiasm to want to end it” from both sides for the US to continue negotiations, after Rubio warned last week that Washington could walk away from its efforts to end the conflict if there were no signs of progress.
    


            The broad framework has been presented to both sides, Rubio and the State Department have said, to determine whether the differences can be narrowed in a short timeframe. There are still pieces of the framework to be filled out and the US plans to work with the Europeans and the Ukrainians on that this week, the official told CNN.

            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday the negotiations were “hopefully moving in the right direction,” and declined to say what “stepping back” from the peace efforts might look like for the US.
    


            Moscow has previously stalled on ceasefire negotiations and rejected an earlier US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire agreed to by Kyiv.
    


            However, under pressure from Trump, Ukraine and Russia have expressed willingness to negotiate for the first time in years; the two sides have not held direct talks since the early weeks of Moscow's invasion in 2022.
    


            On Monday, Putin raised the prospect of holding direct talks with Ukraine about a ceasefire that would halt striking civilian targets, but said further discussion was needed on how to define a civilian target.
    


            Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later confirmed the Russian president's remarks, saying “(Putin) had in mind negotiations and discussions with the Ukrainian side,” Reuters reported, citing Russia's Interfax news agency.

Fossil teeth show species of protemnodon that roamed Australia between 5m and 40,000 years ago lived and died near Queensland caves

Despite their immense size, species of prehistoric giant kangaroos from a site in Queensland were probably homebodies with a surprisingly small range compared to other kangaroos, according to new Australian research.

Protemnodon, which roamed the Australian continent between 5m and 40,000 years ago and is now extinct, was significantly larger than its modern relatives. Some species weighed up to 170kg, making them more than twice as heavy as the largest red kangaroo.

Given their size, researchers expected they might have an expansive territory, said University of Wollongong palaeo-ecologist Chris Laurikainen Gaete, the co-author of the study published in PLOS One.

That's because in most modern plant-eating mammals, including kangaroos and other macropods, larger body size correlated with geographic range, he said. A small marsupial such as the pademelon, for example, occupies an area smaller than a kilometre squared, whereas the red kangaroo – the largest of all kinds – in outback Australia can hop long distances, sometimes further than 20km.

But analysis of fossil teeth found near Mt Etna, 30km north of Rockhampton in Queensland, revealed something quite different. These protemnodon kept to close quarters, living and dying near the caves where their remains were found.

Co-author Dr Scott Hocknull, a vertebrate palaeontologist and senior curator at the Queensland Museum, said the individuals from Mt Etna seemed to be “real homebodies” that stayed within “a tiny pocket” in and around the limestone caves.

“These gigantic kangaroos were just chilling at home, eating the rainforest leaves, because there were heaps of them around. That also means that the environment was quite stable. It meant that over hundreds of thousands of years, these animals decided that staying put was a good bet.”

The population at Mt Etna was “probably quite happy” for some time, Hocknull said. The rainforest probably provided a reliable source of food, while the caves offered protection from prehistoric predators, such as marsupial lions.

But their restricted range was a “bad bet” in the end, Hocknull said, because it pre-disposed them to a risk of extinction when a changing climate and increasing aridity disrupted the rainforest environment about 280,000 years ago.

Dr Isaac Kerr, who specialises in kangaroo palaeontology at Flinders University and was not involved with the study, said protemnodon fossils – found mainly in the south and east of the country – indicated there were several species adapted to different environments.

“Probably they were all over the whole continent, including New Guinea,” he said. A site in Tasmania had one of the latest surviving species, dated to 41,000 years ago.

Kerr said these megafauna kangaroos ranged in size but were generally stockier than their modern counterparts, with shorter feet.

Protemnodon probably looked something like a wallaroo, he said, “squat and muscular but still quite large compared to a modern kangaroo”.

Mt Etna is one of Australia's richest fossil sites, containing evidence of ancient Pleistocene rainforests and records covering periods of past environmental change when rainforests gave way to open, arid environments.

The researchers' next step was to apply similar techniques to fossils of smaller kangaroos such as tree kangaroos, pademelons and rock wallabies from Mt Etna, which still have living descendants, to understand how they survived the environmental changes while protemnodon died out.

The study compared the unique chemical signatures found in the local geology with those found in the fossilised teeth to establish the range of each animal, Gaete said.

“Strontium is an element that varies in the environment, specifically in underlying bedrocks – so a limestone will have a significantly different strontium signature compared to something like volcanic rock or basalt,” he said. These unique signatures made their way into soil and plants, and were reflected in the fossilised teeth of herbivores that ate those plants.

Laurikainen Gaete said the technique could be used to understand, on a site-by-site basis, why certain species of megafauna disappeared from particular places.

Hocknull said: “It fundamentally shifts how palaeontologists and ecologists look at the fossil record.”

PARIS, April 23. /TASS/. The withdrawal of the Ukrainian military from the territories of Russia's constituent regions of Donbass and Novorossiya is necessary to establish peace in Ukraine, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told France's Le Point in the interview.

"If Ukraine withdraws its troops from these four regions, then yes," he said when asked by the magazine's correspondent whether the conflict would end if this condition was met.

The Kremlin spokesman recalled that these regions are enshrined in the Russian Constitution as an integral part of it. He also noted that at the moment some territories of these regions are still occupied by the Kiev regime. "According to the results of the referendums, these territories have entered the administrative borders of Russia. From our point of view, this is a de jure and de facto situation," Peskov said.

Over 300 Canadian electoral candidates have endorsed a 5-point “Vote Palestine” platform thanks to activist pressure.

Montreal, Canada — The United States has loomed large over Canada's upcoming election, with concerns over President Donald Trump's tariffs and annexation threats dominating much of the campaign.

But for many Canadians, another topic has also been front-of-mind in the lead-up to the vote on April 28: Israel's war on Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

“This is a priority issue for many Canadians,” said Dania Majid, a Palestinian community advocate and lawyer based in Toronto, in an interview with Truthout. “We are not detached from what is happening in Palestine.”

Last month, a survey commissioned by the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) found that 55 percent of Canadian voters backed a ban on weapons exports to Israel as the war in Gaza dragged on. Another 49 percent said they would support extending that ban to weapons parts and military training, as well.

A recent Canadian Muslim Public Affairs Council (CMPAC) election survey also found that 58 percent of Canadian Muslims said Canada's policy on Palestine was their top concern. More than 86 percent of respondents also said they viewed the Canadian government's position as “completely inadequate.”

And in mid-April, thousands of people from across Canada converged on Parliament Hill in the capital, Ottawa, to demand action from Canada's political leaders to end Israel's war on Gaza.

When the Canadian election campaign began in late March, Palestinians in Gaza were once again facing a deadly and relentless bombardment after Israel broke the ceasefire, and the humanitarian crisis gripping the coastal enclave was deepening by the day.

In the occupied West Bank, frequent Israeli military and settler attacks were forcing thousands of Palestinians from their homes.

In response Majid and other organizers launched a Canada-wide push called “Vote Palestine” to make Palestinian rights an issue in the race.

Despite an election race dominated by anxieties around Trump's threats against Canada as well as housing and grocery costs, activists have forced Palestine into the conversation.

The goal, Majid explained, has been to show Canada's politicians that the situation in Palestine has gone beyond foreign policy to become a domestic political issue — and something that they cannot ignore.

“We want to ask those who are seeking to be our representatives on Parliament Hill what their positions are on Palestine and what they are going to do about supporting Palestinian human rights,” she told Truthout.

“With the genocide still raging [in Gaza], with the ethnic cleansing, land theft and oppression in the West Bank — this is the context this federal election is happening in.”

The focus on Palestine during the federal election campaign comes as Canada has seen months of protests, sit-ins, and other actions spurred by anger over the Israeli bombardment of Gaza and the Canadian government's stance.

Canada has long presented itself as taking a middle ground, backing a two-state solution and stressing the need to uphold international law. 

But Palestinian rights advocates and other experts say that, in practice, Canada has largely sided with Israel, a country with which it maintains strong economic and diplomatic ties.

As the war in Gaza raged, the Canadian government faced calls to act.

A growing chorus of Canadians — from Palestinian, Arab and Muslim community members to health care workers, progressive activists and others — urged the government to pressure Israel to end its military offensive.

Near-weekly protests were held in major Canadian cities, raising awareness about the situation in Gaza. Meanwhile, similar to scenes in the U.S., students at Montreal's McGill University and the University of Toronto erected protest encampments last year to end what they said was their schools' complicity in Israel's war.

Pro-Israel lobby groups and lawmakers urged university administrators to crack down, raising questions about freedom of speech and academic liberties. Nonetheless, the encampments drew support from across Canada.

Protesters demanded Ottawa suspend arms shipments to the Israeli military, denounce Israeli abuses against Palestinians, support efforts at the UN to end the war and protect the rights of people in Canada protesting Israel's policies.

Those were some of the same demands that rang out less than two weeks before Election Day as dozens of people gathered in the Montreal neighborhood of Parc-Extension to send a message to their local political candidates.

The protesters rallying in Papineau (a federal electoral district in Montreal, also known in Canada as a “riding”) on April 19 called for a two-way arms embargo against Israel and an end to the war.

“Whoever wins this election needs to respect the will of this neighborhood, and the will of this neighborhood is solidarity with Palestine,” said Amy Darwish, a member of the activist group Papineau for Palestine, which organized the demonstration.

She said Canadian politicians have long treated Palestine as something they can ignore, but that has been changing.

“[People] have been engaging actively with their candidates to make it very clear that it's not possible to ignore this genocide [in Gaza] and that they absolutely need to take action,” Darwish told Truthout.

The “Vote Palestine” campaign is centered on many of the demands Palestinian rights advocates in Canada have been pushing for over the past 18 months.

The campaign has the backing of several organizations in Canada including CMPAC, World Beyond War, Independent Jewish Voices-Canada, and the Ontario branch of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), the country's largest union.

Organizers have urged political candidates to sign onto its five-point platform, which includes imposing a two-way arms embargo on Israel, recognizing the State of Palestine, and funding the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which provides most of the aid in Gaza.

The platform also calls on Canada to end any involvement in illegal Israeli settlements and address anti-Palestinian racism and efforts to crack down on pro-Palestinian speech domestically.

As of April 21, one week before Election Day, more than 300 electoral candidates had endorsed the full “Vote Palestine” platform.

About two-thirds of the signatories are candidates with the left-wing New Democratic Party (NDP), including NDP leader Jagmeet Singh.

While the NDP has traditionally been seen as the Canadian political party that speaks out the most in defense of Palestinian rights, its record on Palestine over the years has been mixed.

Amid Israel's war on Gaza, the party faced criticism and calls to do more to pressure the Liberal government to take concrete action; now, as the election nears, Singh has been more outspoken and pressured other party leaders to unequivocally condemn Israel's war as a genocide.

Others from the Liberal, Green and Bloc Quebecois parties have also signed on. No Conservative Party candidates have signed the pledge.

Majid, the campaign organizer, said that, as a nonpartisan effort, “Vote Palestine” is not endorsing any parties or candidates.

“This is very much about empowering people because we hear often — and we saw this in the U.S. election — people feel very disenfranchised. They go to the polls, but their representatives never represent them,” Majid said.

“We're trying to get people to check back in and give people the resources and the tools to go and speak to candidates … and share that Palestine is an important issue for them in this election [and] that we shouldn't be putting the genocide to the side.”

Indeed, despite an election race dominated by anxieties around Trump's threats against Canada as well as housing and grocery costs, activists have forced Palestine into the conversation.

Notably, the leaders of Canada's main political parties have been asked about their positions on Gaza during recent debates.

On April 17, frontrunner Mark Carney, who replaced former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the leader of the Liberal Party in March, said Canada must work to impose “maximum pressure” to reach an immediate ceasefire.

He said all captives held in Gaza must also be released and humanitarian aid must resume for Palestinians.

But Carney has drawn criticism for refusing to describe what is happening in Gaza as a “genocide” — a term scholars, human rights groups, and other experts have used to describe Israel's military campaign and siege on the enclave.

“We know that if you can't name genocide, you definitely won't stop it,” the advocacy group Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East said on social media of Carney's stance.

Pro-Israel lobby groups in Canada have been outspoken during the Gaza war, defending the Israeli government's policies and attacking lawmakers who have spoken out about human rights abuses against Palestinians.

Framing their unwavering support for Israel as part of a fight against anti-Semitism, these groups have maintained close ties to Canada's two main political parties — the Liberals and the Conservatives — for years.

Israel, too, has enjoyed friendly relations with both Liberal and Conservative prime ministers. That includes both Trudeau and his Conservative predecessor, Stephen Harper, who was once described by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a “great friend of Israel.” Yet amid the pressure from pro-Palestinian activists during the Gaza war, the Liberals, who have been in power since 2015, have faced angry criticism from the Israeli government for offering limited criticism of the offensive.

The government's announcement that it was barring any Canadian-made arms from reaching Gaza, for example, drew anger among Israeli leaders.

But Canadian weapons and weapons parts are still able to reach Israel via the U.S., researchers have found.

For his part, Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre — whose party is trailing the Liberals after it held a double-digit lead in the polls at the start of the year — has taken a staunchly pro-Israel position.

He has promised to cut funding for UNRWA, the UN agency responsible for delivering humanitarian assistance in Gaza, which he has called a “terrorist” organization.

Poilievre also recently said a Conservative government would deport non-Canadians who take part in what he dubbed “hate marches,” referring to pro-Palestine demonstrations. He also promised a “tougher” response for Canadians who participate.

“We will bring in tougher laws to target vandalism, hate marches that break laws, violent attacks based on ethnicity and religion. Anyone who's here on a visitor visa who carries out lawbreaking will be deported from this country,” he said on April 12.

Poilievre's comments drew comparisons to Trump, whose administration has moved to deport students and permanent residents in the U.S. who have spoken out against Israel's war on Gaza.

“Your treatment of Palestinians has been frankly disgusting,” Singh, the leader of the NDP, told Poilievre during one of the leadership debates.

Khaled Al-Qazzaz, executive director of the CMPAC advocacy group, said the Conservative leader's positions are “not acceptable” for members of Canada's Muslim community.

Recent protests in solidarity with Palestinians have been “peaceful and absent of any form of violence,” said Al-Qazzaz, stressing that Muslim Canadians have been reeling from what is happening in Gaza.

“Gaza until now is being hit, is being bombarded, is being ethnically cleansed, and the community feels that,” he told Truthout.

“The more they [candidates] neglect committing to a principled position, the more irrelevant they become on the world stage, and the less credibility they have with Canadians,” Al-Qazzaz added.

CMPAC launched the website MuslimsVote.ca to encourage political candidates to take what Al-Qazzaz described as a “principled” stance.

To date, the campaign has endorsed 47 candidates it says have expressed support for — or have a strong track record of standing up for — Palestinians. Those candidates are about evenly split between Liberal and NDP candidates.

“The new thing in this election is that this time our community is more organized,” Al-Qazzaz said of the movement.

“There are several organizations that are involved in political organizing, in articulating these policy demands, negotiating and discussing with candidates and politicians, [and] mobilizing people on the ground,” he said. “More importantly, there is more of a united front — whether on the organizational level or [in the] community — that is united by a cause.”

But will Canada's Palestine policy really have an impact on the election outcome?

Al-Qazzaz said he believes Muslim voters can influence races in areas where their communities make up a large chunk of the electorate, such as ridings in the Greater Toronto Area and in British Columbia on Canada's west coast.

The country's Muslim population more than doubled between 2001 and 2021, the last year for which data is available, going from about 580,000 to more than 1.7 million people in that 20-year span. The population is likely even higher today.

“When the race is very close, the difference between the top two [candidates] is less than the number of registered Muslim voters in [some of] these ridings. This makes the Muslim vote an impactful decision-maker, or kingmaker,” Al-Qazzaz said.

Yet whatever happens on April 28, both Al-Qazzaz and Majid stressed that the push to get Canadian politicians to speak out on Palestine will continue beyond the election.

They each described support for Palestinian rights as a “litmus test” that demonstrates not only where a politician stands on foreign policy but on a range of domestic issues as well, including social programs, immigrant rights, and freedoms in Canada.

“If they've signed the pledge, then [there's an opportunity] to ask them what's next, how they're going to operate to realize that pledge. If they haven't signed the pledge, then there's an opportunity to keep that conversation going,” Majid said.

“It doesn't end on Election Day. The real work really starts after Election Day.”

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

            A major meeting in London aimed at bringing about an end to Russia's war in Ukraine has been downgraded after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he would skip the summit, escalating a clash between Washington and Kyiv over the future of Russian-occupied territory.
    


            Rubio had been expected to take part in the discussions with Ukrainian, UK and European officials, but State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Tuesday that he would no longer attend due to “logistical issues.”
    


            London's Foreign Office then confirmed on Wednesday that the meeting would take place at a lower level. “Official level talks will continue but these are closed to media,” the department said in a message to journalists.
    


            The developments throw new uncertainty over the diplomatic efforts to end Russia's war. The United States has become increasingly steadfast in its push to force Kyiv to an agreement, but Ukraine is adamant that it will not give up Crimea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014, or parts of eastern Ukraine that were captured following Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022.
    


            President Donald Trump slammed Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday for his comments that Ukraine wouldn't recognize Russian control of Crimea, calling the remarks “very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia.”
    


            “It's inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy's that makes it so difficult to settle this War. He has nothing to boast about! The situation for Ukraine is dire — He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country,” he posted on Truth Social.
    


            US Vice President JD Vance threatened to abandon negotiations on Wednesday, telling reporters during a visit to India: “We've issued a very explicit proposal to both the Russians and Ukrainians, and it's time for them to either say yes or for the US to walk away from this process. We've engaged in an extraordinary amount of diplomacy, of on the ground work.”

            But Ukraine's European allies, particularly Britain and France, have been hoping to bridge the divide. Wednesday's talks were due to follow a meeting in Paris last week in which officials from the US, the United Kingdom, France and Germany discussed the American framework for a ceasefire.
    


            After Rubio reversed plans to attend the latest talks, Bruce said President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, would represent the US in London instead.
    


            The US proposal that has caused deadlock includes recognizing Russia's control of Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula illegally annexed by Moscow, an official familiar with the framework told CNN. It would also put a ceasefire in place along the front lines of the war, the official said.
    


            Any move to recognize Russia's control of Crimea would reverse a decade of US policy.
    


            Zelensky made clear Tuesday that he was open to talks with Russia, but that Kyiv would not accept a deal that recognizes Moscow's control of Crimea.
    


            “Ukraine will not legally recognize the occupation of Crimea,” he told reporters. “There is nothing to talk about. It is against our constitution.”
    


            Asked to clarify about whether he meant the US wanted to freeze the territorial lines where they are, Vance said Wednesday, “No, I didn't say that. What I said is the current line, somewhere close to them is where you're ultimately, I think, going to draw the new lines in the conflict. Now of course, that means the Ukrainians and the Russians are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own. There's gonna have to be some territorial swaps.”
    


            Meanwhile, the war has resumed with full force this week, following a surprise ceasefire over the Easter weekend that both sides accused each other of breaching.
    


            On Wednesday, Ukrainian authorities said nine people were killed and at least 30 wounded when a Russian drone struck a bus carrying people to work near the city of Marhanets in the Dnipropetrovsk region.
    


            Russia's National Guard said it destroyed 17 Ukrainian attack drones overnight, state-run news agency Tass reported on Wednesday.
    


            The talks in London were scheduled as US officials publicly voiced frustration over the lack of progress at bringing an end to the war.
    


            Trump has said he would “have to see an enthusiasm to want to end it” from both sides for the US to continue negotiations, after Rubio warned last week that Washington could walk away from its efforts to end the conflict if there were no signs of progress.
    


            The broad framework has been presented to both sides, Rubio and the State Department have said, to determine whether the differences can be narrowed in a short timeframe. There are still pieces of the framework to be filled out and the US plans to work with the Europeans and the Ukrainians on that this week, the official told CNN.

The Kremlin's 30-hour truce was designed to shift blame to Ukraine. Did Trump buy it?



            Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff was expected to travel to Moscow this week to continue negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the White House said Tuesday. The Kremlin confirmed Witkoff's visit, but did not disclose further details, according to Russian state media.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday the negotiations were “hopefully moving in the right direction,” and declined to say what “stepping back” from the peace efforts might look like for the US.
    


            Moscow has previously stalled on ceasefire negotiations and rejected an earlier US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire agreed to by Kyiv.
    


            However, under pressure from Trump, Ukraine and Russia have expressed willingness to negotiate for the first time in years; the two sides have not held direct talks since the early weeks of Moscow's invasion in 2022.
    


            On Monday, Putin raised the prospect of holding direct talks with Ukraine about a ceasefire that would halt striking civilian targets, but said further discussion was needed on how to define a civilian target.
    


            Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later confirmed the Russian president's remarks, saying “(Putin) had in mind negotiations and discussions with the Ukrainian side,” Reuters reported, citing Russia's Interfax news agency.

MOSCOW, April 23. /TASS/. African countries are tired of the arrogant behavior and double standards of the former West European colonial powers, Russia's Permanent Representative to the UN Vasily Nebenzya said at the plenary session of the 4th Forum "Russia-Africa: What Next?".

"We are convinced that the crisis situations that many African countries are currently going through are predominantly a consequence of long years of colonial dependence, consistent opposition to the manifestation of neo-colonial practices in Africa, where there is a real fatigue with the arrogant behavior and double standards of the former West European colonial powers," he said in a video message to the forum's participants.

Russia's ambassador to the UN added that Africans do not intend to put up with this state of affairs. Nebenzya recalled that Russia, in its turn, consistently opposes modern practices of neocolonialism.

"Trust in the collective West as a partner is declining everywhere, and there is a growing demand for fundamental changes in the modern system of international relations. Examples of successful cooperation on independent multilateral platforms, such as the Non-Aligned Movement, are multiplying," he emphasized.

Nebenzya also noted that the UN Security Council should adapt to the growing role of African countries in global world affairs and "keep pace with these processes."

“This message will serve as your only warning,” stated a memo from Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer's chief of staff.

This story was originally published by ProPublica.


A top official in the Department of Labor this week informed all staff members that they could face criminal charges if they speak to journalists, former employees or others about agency business.

A memo sent Monday by Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer's chief of staff, Jihun Han, and obtained by ProPublica, states that “individuals who disclose confidential information or engage in unauthorized communications with the media may face serious legal consequences.”

Among the ramifications, the memo states, are “potential criminal penalties, depending on the nature of the information and the applicable laws,” and “immediate disciplinary actions, up to and including termination.”

The guidance document went on to say that “any unauthorized communication with the media,” regardless of what information is shared or how it is shared, “will be treated as a serious offense.”

The memo listed laws, regulations and a departmental guide to explain its legal position. Among them was a regulation concerning civil servants' ethical obligations and a law, the Freedom of Information Act, guaranteeing the public the right to inspect certain public records.

“This message will serve as your only warning,” the memo stated.

The warning comes as current and former Labor Department employees have spoken to the news media about harms they see resulting from the dismantling of portions of their agency, which enforces laws guaranteeing rights to a safe workplace, fair pay and protections against discrimination.

“It's very chilling,” a Labor Department employee who requested anonymity for fear of retribution told ProPublica. “It's never a good look when you're telling people to never talk about what you're doing.”

Labor Department spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“These types of missives can chill the free flow of information to the press and the public,” said Gabe Rottman, vice president of policy at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. “That's a concern.”

Civil servants do not sacrifice their First Amendment rights by accepting a job with the federal government, but there do exist higher restrictions on what information they can disclose publicly. Government agencies that handle classified information have on rare occasions launched criminal investigations against leakers, but those are typically invoked only when leaks involve classified national security intelligence or protected financial information, Rottman said.

“But normally, disclosures to the press or others would be a matter of employee discipline as opposed to carrying criminal sanctions,” he said.

While the memo raising the possibility of criminal penalties was sent to Labor Department employees, it reflects a common approach by the administration of President Donald Trump to guard against federal government employees speaking to reporters.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, for example, has publicly announced an aggressive pursuit of leakers. Elon Musk, who launched the Department of Government Efficiency, which is at the heart of the shake-up of the federal government, has bragged about his tactics in rooting out leaks at his companies. And Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has blamed alleged leaks by former Pentagon staffers for reigniting controversy over his use of the Signal messaging app to discuss military operations.

Federal employees at various agencies told ProPublica that an air of suspicion has descended on their workplace during Trump's second term, with rumors flying of surveillance of rank-and-file government workers. In the Department of Agriculture, for example, a banner temporarily appeared on government computers when employees logged in, telling them that “unauthorized or improper use of this system may result in disciplinary action, as well as civil and criminal penalties.”

Agriculture Department spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Labor Department employee told ProPublica that Monday's memo felt like the latest attack on a workforce already weathering layoffs, spending freezes and reorganizations.

“It's been horrible. It's been a deeply exhausting roller coaster,” the employee said. “It's very difficult to work when you're in a constant state of being terrorized by your employer.”



We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

American Lung Association's study says almost 156 million people live in areas with unhealthy levels of soot or smog

Almost half of Americans are breathing in dangerous levels of air pollutants, a new report shows, a rise compared with a year ago and likely to further increase in coming years thanks to the climate crisis and the Trump administration's sweeping environmental rollbacks.

Just over 156 million people live in neighborhoods with unhealthy levels of soot or smog – a 16% rise compared with last year and the highest number in a decade, according to the American Lung Association (ALA) annual state of the air report.

Soot and smog can cause premature death and increase the risk of an array of serious medical conditions such as asthma attacks, heart attacks and strokes, preterm births and impaired cognitive functioning in later life. Particle pollution also increases the risk of lung cancer.

Both pollutants are made worse by heat waves and wildfires – extreme weather events getting more intense and widespread due to human-made global heating.

Every year, the ALA grades exposure to unhealthy levels of ground-level smog (ozone pollution), and year-round and short-term spikes in soot (fine particle pollution/PM2.5) over a three-year period (2021 to 2023).

Its latest analysis found that almost 43m people live in areas with failing grades for all three measures. A person of color is more than twice as likely as a white American to live in a neighborhood with unhealthy levels of smog and soot. But Latino Americans are the most impacted, and three times more likely to be breathing in both toxic air pollutants.

PM2.5 or soot comes from wildfires, wood-burning stoves, coal-fired power plants and diesel engines among other industrial sources – and can be deadly. The new report includes data from summer 2023, when smoke from wildfires across Canada lit up the sky and engulfed midwestern and eastern states in soot.

Ozone or smog is a potent respiratory irritant likened to causing sunburn of the lungs. After years of progress on cleaning up ozone, some communities are seeing the worst smog in years.

The climate crisis-driven extreme heat and wildfires contributed to the increase in ozone levels for many parts of the country, most notably in central states from Minnesota to Texas. Warmer temperatures increase the risk of ozone forming and makes it harder to clean up.

“Families across the US are dealing with the health impacts of air pollution every day, and extreme heat and wildfires are making it worse. Air pollution is causing kids to have asthma attacks, making people who work outdoors sick, and leading to low birth weight in babies,” said Harold Wimmer, the president and CEO of the American Lung Association.

Only two cities, Bangor, Maine, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, were ranked as clean cities with no spikes in smog or soot, reflecting an overall worsening of air quality across the country, the report found.

“Efforts to slash staff, funding and programs at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are leaving families even more vulnerable to harmful air pollution,” Wimmer said.

The EPA was created in 1970 by the Nixon government amid increasing protests over unchecked industrial expansion by public health and environmental advocates, as well as communities bearing the brunt of air, water and land pollution.

The Trump administration has made dismantling climate and environmental regulations, policies and programs a top priority, and has already taken steps to gut the EPA by ordering mass layoffs and funding freezes. Environmental justice has come under particular attack, with Trump conflating efforts to address decades of environmental racism that led to poor air quality from heavy industry, landfills and highways being deliberately located in communities of color with diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies.

Even before Trump 2.0, almost 73 million people lived in counties where neither the ozone nor PM2 pollution levels are being monitored, according to the association, a public health data black hole likely to get worse as the funding cuts hit.

Reports that the U.S. could formally give de jure recognition to Russia's control over Crimea have landed like a bombshell in Kyiv, with lawmakers unanimous in their opposition to such a move, as well as issuing grave warnings about its potential consequences.

"(The potential recognition of Crimea's annexation) sets a very dangerous precedent that could plunge the world into numerous wars," Volodymyr Ariev, a lawmaker with the European Solidarity Party, told the Kyiv Independent.

"Ukraine should not side with those intending to violate the fundamental principles established after World War II," he added. 

The Trump administration's final proposal for ending the Russia-Ukraine war included U.S. de jure recognition of Russia's control over Crimea, along with de facto recognition of its occupation of other Ukrainian territories, Axios reported on April 23, citing sources.

The news supports earlier reporting that the recognition of Russia's occupation of Crimea and a ban on Ukraine joining NATO are being considered as part of a U.S.-backed proposal to end the war.

Yelyzaveta Yasko, a lawmaker from the Servant of the People party, told the Kyiv Independent that she "really fears" the question of recognizing Crimea being raised during negotiations.

"I don't like it. I cannot imagine us agreeing to this if it's real de jure recognition, if I'm honest. If it was de facto then we could, but de jure is too much" she said.

De facto recognition would mean accepting that where Russian troops are in control of Ukrainian territory, at least for the foreseeable future, they remain so.

But it would leave open the option of the land returning to Ukraine, potentially by diplomatic means, something President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously acknowledged could be the only way to regain control of Crimea.

De jure recognition, however, would be final — an admission that the land in question is under Russian control and will remain so indefinitely. The only means of reversing it would be by force.

Russia occupied Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in February 2014. In March 2014, the Russian-controlled Crimean parliament voted to hold a "referendum" to join Russia.

The sham voting on annexation was conducted in the absence of any international observers and with armed Russian soldiers present at polling locations.

Ukrainian lawmakers who spoke to the Kyiv Independent said recognizing Russia's de jure control of the peninsula is next to impossible.

"The Ukrainian Constitution does not provide for the recognition of its territories as being seized by another (country)," Ariev said. 

According to the Ukrainian Constitution, Crimea is a legally recognized and inseparable part of Ukraine.

No acts can be passed by the Ukrainian government that contradict the country's Constitution.

The only way Ukraine could legally recognize Crimea as Russian would be to hold a referendum on the issue and put the vote to the people. While recent polling shows the number of Ukrainians willing to make territorial concessions to end the war has risen, a majority still oppose the idea.

Further, polling has not specified between de facto and de jure control, with de jure likely to be more heavily opposed than de facto.

"No Ukrainian government has a mandate to recognize Crimea as Russian," Halyna Yanchenko, a lawmaker from the Servant of the People party, told the Kyiv Independent.

"Any peace agreement that includes such a provision would risk sparking unrest within the country. That's why no Ukrainian leadership would ever agree to it. 

"And there is simply no chance such a deal would pass a vote in Ukraine's Parliament."

Ukraine finds itself in what Zelensky on April 22 described as "a very dangerous moment," with the U.S. threatening to back out of the peace effort if Kyiv doesn't agree to its proposal.

Talking to journalists during a visit to India, U.S. Vice President JD Vance said that it is time for Kyiv and Moscow "to either say yes or for the United States to walk away from this process."

All of this risks playing into the hands of the Kremlin, with both Moscow and Washington potentially being able to point to Ukraine's refusal as the main sticking point of negotiations.

"Ukraine will never agree," Oleksandr Merezhko, lawmaker and chair of the parliament's foreign affairs committee, told the Kyiv Independent.

"It will be considered as a provocation with a view (for the U.S.) to exit negotiations and to put the blame on the victim of the aggression."

Ariev said that if the U.S. follows through with the move, it could "open Pandora's box globally."

"Recognizing territory seized by military means — this would be the first such recognition since World War II — sets a dangerous precedent that could reignite wars in the future, which could potentially reach the scale of World War III," he said.

"This is extremely dangerous and cruel."

SYKTYVKAR, April 23. /TASS/. Moscow will never support any initiatives that stipulate deploying European troops to Ukraine, Federation Council (upper house of parliament) Chairperson Valentina Matviyenko told reporters.

"As for the deployment of European troops to Ukraine, Russia will not even entertain such a possibility - not at any negotiating table, not ever. This is unacceptable for us and such an initiative has no chance of success," she pointed out.

According to Matviyenko, the idea was doomed from the start. "We will never support it because this concerns our country's security and sovereignty. It doesn't matter under what flag they do that, NATO's or otherwise, because it's about troops from the unfriendly countries that are confronting Russia, still nursing plans to inflict a strategic defeat on us," the Federation Council chair noted.

"Never will Russia allow it to happen; it's impossible and unrealistic. And as for their regular meetings and get-togethers, let them amuse themselves," Matviyenko concluded.

Irish language group uses Coachella gig to denounce Gaza attacks, saying ‘Palestinians have nowhere to go'

Sharon Osbourne has urged US authorities to revoke work visas for Kneecap after the Irish language rap group used a performance at Coachella to denounce Israeli attacks on Gaza.

The TV presenter accused the band of hate speech and supporting terrorist organisations and said it should not be allowed to perform in the US. “I urge you to join me in advocating for the revocation of Kneecap's work visa,” she exhorted followers on X on Tuesday.

Fox News commentators also condemned the band and accused it of bringing “Nazi Germany” sentiments to America.

Kneecap scorned the Fox News comments and posted supportive messages from fans, saying it had received thousands of such endorsements as well as “hundreds of violent Zionist threats”. Almost all the concerts of a US tour scheduled for October have sold out, it added.

The trio, Móglaí Bap and Mo Chara from Belfast and DJ Próvaí from Derry, have built a following in the US with a mix of Irish republican totems, punk spirit and a film that stormed last year's Utah film festival.

During their set last weekend at Coachella, the California desert music festival, Mo Chara said Britain had persecuted Irish people but not bombed them from the skies. “The Palestinians have nowhere to go.”

The performers led the audience in chants of “free, free Palestine” and screened pro-Palestinian messages on to screens. “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,” said one. “It is being enabled by the US government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes,” said another. The last used an expletive against Israel.

Osbourne, a judge on the TV show America's Got Talent, said the festival had “compromised its moral and spiritual integrity” by allowing Kneecap and Green Day to denounce Israel over the 18-month war.

“Music's primary purpose is to unite people. It should not be a venue for promoting terrorist organisations or spreading hate”, she said, singling out Kneecap's “aggressive” political statements.

“This band openly support terrorist organisations. This behaviour raises concerns about the appropriateness of their participation in such a festival and further shows they are booked to play in the USA.”

Fox News commentators compared the band's comments to Nazi Germany, with one saying the band should be removed from “authority positions” and that the “values of education” should be re-instilled.

Kneecap posted a clip of the segment and said the commentator's admission that she had not previously heard of the band was the “only part of this shite that made any sense”.

The group said they had planned to denounce “US-backed genocide in Gaza” at an earlier performance in Coachella, on 11 April, but that the comments did not appear on the screen. The band also complained that the festival's livestream did not carry a chant celebrating the death of Margaret Thatcher.

Former NHL players Cal Foote, Dillon Dubé, Alex Formenton, Michael McLeod and Carter Hart, accused in a sexual assault following the World Junior Hockey Championships in 2018, arrive at the Court House in London, Ont., on April 23.The Globe and Mail/The Canadian Press

Crown attorney Heather Donkers began laying out the prosecution's case against five former members of Canada's world junior men's hockey team on Wednesday afternoon, the first day of their sexual-assault trial in London, Ont. 

This case, Ms. Donkers began, is about consent.

“This case is not about whether [E.M.] said ‘no' or removed herself from an unwelcome situation when she had the opportunity,” Ms. Donkers said. “This case is about whether [E.M.] voluntarily agreed to engage in each and every sexual act that took place, at the time that it happened.” 

The complainant's name is protected by a publication ban.

Michael McLeod, Carter Hart, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dubé and Cal Foote are accused of sexually assaulting E.M. in a hotel room after a Hockey Canada gala in June, 2018. Mr. McLeod faces a second charge of being a party to sexual assault. 

Each has pleaded not guilty.

Wednesday is the first day of what is expected to be an eight-week trial. The morning began with Ontario Superior Court Justice Maria Carroccia addressing the 14-person jury, instructing them on their obligations, including that they are to keep an open-mind and resist the urge to fall prey to myths and stereotypes about how sexual-assault complainants are supposed to behave. 

Said Ms. Donkers: “It's important that you keep this instruction in mind, as the evidence that we anticipate you will hear in this case may not match up with expectations you have about what a sexual assault is or looks like.”

The Crown's first witness will be London police Detective Tiffany Waque, who will present video surveillance from the night. The footage is from a London bar, Jack's, where E.M. encountered some of the accused players.

At the bar, E.M. – who was then 20 years old – consumed eight drinks, the Crown said. Then shortly after 1:20 a.m. on June 19, 2018, Ms. Donkers said that E.M. left Jack's with Mr. McLeod and had consensual sex at the Delta hotel in room 209. The Crown said that after this encounter, “the atmosphere in the room changed.” It is alleged that E.M. noticed Mr. McLeod was on his phone, inviting others to room. 

The jury, Ms. Donkers said, will see a copy of those text messages, including one that read: “who wants to be in a 3 way quick. 209 – mikey.”

Ms. Donkers said that the jury will also hear that Mr. McLeod went into the hallway and invited others into his room, where E.M. was laying naked. 

“There were up to 10 men inside this standard-sized hotel room at different points in the night,” Ms. Donkers said.

The Crown said that E.M. felt “drunk, surprised” by what was happening and “uncertain how to react.” Over the new few hours, various sexual acts took place between the players and E.M. 

“You will hear from some witnesses that, at different times in the night, [E.M.] was offering to perform sexual acts or was asking whether anyone was going to have sex with her,” Ms. Donkers said.

The Crown said that E.M. will explain to the jury that she was going along with what she felt was expected of her, because she was “drunk, uncomfortable” and didn't know what would happen if she didn't.

Ms. Donkers said that the jury will hear that each of the five players engaged in sexual acts with E.M. without her voluntary agreement. Mr. Dubé is accused of slapping E.M.'s naked buttocks while she was engaged in a sexual act with another player. Mr. Foote “did the splits over [E.M.]'s face while she lay on the ground, grazing his genitals over her face.”

The Crown also explained the second charge against Mr. McLeod, saying this relates to the allegation that Mr. McLeod “assisted and encouraged” his teammates to engage in sexual acts with E.M., while knowing she had not consented.

E.M. did not say “no” to the acts, Ms. Donkers said, nor did she attempt to physically resist. However, E.M. will tell the jury that she felt she had no choice, Ms. Donkers said. She was 20 years old, intoxicated and in a room with many large men whom she did not know. The players, Ms. Donkers said, were “speaking to each other as if she were not there” and were telling her to do certain things.

“On occasion, she tried to leave the room, but the men coaxed her into staying,” Ms. Donkers alleged. 

The Crown also addressed the existence of two brief videos taken that night, in which E.M. can be seen saying statements such as “it was all consensual.” Ms. Donkers noted that Justice Carroccia will explain that consent must be given for each sexual act at the time it is happening.

The prosecution's evidence has not been tested in court. The players' defence counsel will lay out their version of events later in the trial.

Canada's junior hockey team won the world championship in 2018. That June, Hockey Canada – the governing body for the sport in Canada – held a gala honouring the players in London. Afterward, many members of the team went out celebrating downtown. The sexual assault is alleged to have occurred that night.

An initial investigation from London police was closed without charges in 2019, but the file was reopened after a wave of national outrage surfaced when the case became public three years later. 

In 2022, TSN reported that Hockey Canada had quietly settled a lawsuit brought forward by the complainant. Hockey Canada entered the settlement without the players' knowledge or involvement.

The Globe and Mail then revealed that Hockey Canada had been using a so-called National Equity Fund, a pool of money collected in part through registration fees, to pay out settlements to sexual-assault complainants. Hockey Canada entered the settlement without the players' knowledge or involvement.

At the time they were charged, Mr. Dubé was a member of the Calgary Flames, Mr. Hart was with the Philadelphia Flyers, and Mr. McLeod and Mr. Foote were playing for the New Jersey Devils. Mr. Formenton, who had previously been a member of the Ottawa Senators, was playing for the Swiss club HC Ambrì-Piotta.

MOSCOW, April 23. /TASS/. Officials from the US, Europe, and Ukraine were unable to hold a meeting in London to discuss the Ukraine issue because they had failed to bring their positions closer together, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at a briefing.

"As far as we understand, they have been unable to align their positions on some issues, which is why the meeting did not take place," he noted.

Peskov also pointed out that the London meeting was supposed to give the US "an opportunity to continue its mediation efforts."

According to the Daily Telegraph, the US planned to present a seven-point settlement plan at the London meeting, which included Washington's recognition of Russia's sovereignty over Crimea. However, Vladimir Zelensky rejected the option on Tuesday, after which, according to the New York Times, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called off his trip to the UK.

As a U.S.-proposed deal for Ukraine's natural resources stalled amid months of tense negotiations, some in Ukraine who were initially optimistic about the agreement are starting to lose hope.

At least that's how one graphite mine in Ukraine's central Kirovohrad Oblast feels about it, business reporter Dominic Culverwell reports in his latest.

The Zavalivskiy mine, located in the village of Zavallia, holds some 7.5 million metric tons of graphite ore in the second largest flake graphite mine in Europe.

But the war has taken a big toll on the mine. Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, the company has lost nearly a third of its workforce. Production has plummeted from 15,000 metric tons annually to 850 metric tons last year and it's lost around half of its customers around the world.

Which is why, when the minerals deal came about, the company's CEO was pretty excited.

“I think that it would be really positive if the U.S. came to the Ukrainian mining market. They should spend money and time to build something, to mine something,” CEO Ostap Kostyuk told the Kyiv Independent in February, emphasizing the critical need for investments in the underfunded sector.

In Zavalivskiy Graphite's case, innovation brought in through investors could involve high-tech equipment to purify graphite to a level suitable for use in batteries, called spherical graphite (SPG), which sells for $3,500- $10,000 per metric ton.

Machinery for SPG purification costs $30-40 million, which the currently unprofitable company can't afford. Kostyuk was optimistic the Americans could bring in this technology and cooperate with Zavalivskiy to produce the highly purified graphite and break into a market dominated by China.

But as events unfolded, drafts of the deal were leaked to the public, and it became apparent the U.S. was proposing to gain unprecedented control over Ukraine's sovereign natural resources as “repayment” for its military aid to Ukraine, Kostyuk lost the faith.

Even if the deal is signed this week, which is supposed to happen, the fears that it could be a win-lose for Ukraine have already settled in.

The minerals deal saga has left Kostyuk feeling that Ukraine is on the verge of being “scammed” and will end up on its own, indebted to its allies, Culverwell writes.

“We should recover ourselves. If this help is a debt, my kids and grandkids will pay this debt. So what can we do? We can't do anything,” Kostyuk said in April.

Following a series of rate hikes since the beginning of the year, Ukraine's Central Bank held the interest rate at 15.5% as it expects inflation to begin cooling.

The bank also said, however, that “due to the high level of uncertainty, which has only increased over past months, the National Bank of Ukraine will respond flexibly to changes in the balance of risks to the price dynamics and inflation expectations.”

Price growth is expected to start slowing this summer after it hit its highest level since May 2023 in March, reaching 14.6%. The bank expects inflation to drop to 8.7% at the end of 2025 and reach a target of 5% in 2026.

Ukraine's economic resilience may outlast Russia's oil-funded war machine, says a new report by the London School of Economics' foreign policy think tank LSE IDEAS.

The report looks closely at how both Russia and Ukraine have adapted their economies to the demands of war. Despite the difficulties brought on by a full-scale invasion, the report finds that Ukraine — buoyed by external financing secured through 2027 and improved tax mobilization — is in a surprisingly strong negotiating position.

In contrast, Russia's continued dependence on oil revenues makes it highly vulnerable to price volatility in global oil markets. The country is also facing a looming credit crunch and a potential systemic banking crisis, the report says.

While neither side is set up for “total victory,” Russia's internal vulnerabilities may change its negotiating calculus in the year ahead, says Dr. Luke Cooper, author of the report and associate professorial research fellow in international relations.

“Even in the face of the (President Donald) Trump administration's apparent pivot towards the Russian side, Ukraine and its European allies hold more ‘cards' than many, including President Trump, seem to believe,” says Cooper.

The spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank are happening this week in Washington, D.C., with President Donald Trump's tariff spree expected to dominate talks.

But as Trump and his team take an axe to institutions — and the world order as we know it — people attending the talks are wondering what implications the Trump administration's inward turn away from its global alliances will mean for institutions like the IMF and World Bank.

According to Jimena Zuniga of Bloomberg Economics, a weakened IMF and World Bank would put at risk the emerging markets around the world that rely on the IMF to respond to fiscal challenges such as high debt or shrinking reserves — a list of markets which includes Ukraine.

The IMF came to Ukraine's aid at the start of the full-scale invasion, lending to a country at war for the first time in its nearly 80-year history. In March 2023, the IMF and Ukraine agreed on a loan program to provide Kyiv with $15.6 billion in financing for budget support over four years.

The high-tech weaponry includes drones, electronic warfare systems, and missile technologies, Hlib Kanievskyi, a procurement chief at the Defense Ministry, said on April 21. Kanievskyi also said that the unification of technical standards for drones is among the key objectives for 2025 as the ministry looks to streamline procurement procedures, create a single framework for evaluating products, and accelerate decision-making.

Ukrainian airline SkyUp Airlines has made its first regular flight since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, flying on the Chisinau-Paris route on April 18, the AIN news outlet reported, citing the company's press service. Another flight is scheduled for Lisbon, and the company will also operate routes to 11 cities in seven countries, including France, Spain, Cyprus, Greece, Germany, Czechia, and Sweden.

A French court has approved the enforcement of a $5 billion arbitration award against Russia for damages caused to Ukraine's state-owned energy company Naftogaz during the occupation of Crimea, the company said on April 17. The decision allows Naftogaz to begin legal recovery efforts in France, including seizing Russian state assets to satisfy the award.

MOSCOW, April 23. /TASS/. The Sultan of Oman has visited Moscow, US President Donald Trump is expected to unveil his peace plan for Ukraine soon, and Russia may involve Washington in investigations of Ukrainian war crimes. These stories topped the headlines in Wednesday's newspapers across Russia.

 

Russian President Vladimir Putin has welcomed a second Arab leader to the Kremlin within a week. Following the April 17 official visit of Emir of Qatar Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Sultan of Oman Haitham bin Tariq Al Said arrived in Russia on April 22.

This marks the first high-level encounter between the leaders of Russia and Oman since diplomatic relations were established 40 years ago. The 1985 agreement was signed precisely by Al Said, who was a deputy foreign minister at the time. Heightened interest in the meeting with Oman's sultan stems from the fact that his country serves as a key intermediary in discussions on the nuclear deal between Iran and the US.

It is possible that the sultan conveyed confidential aspects of the deal to the Russian leadership, said Ilya Vaskin, junior research fellow at the Center for Middle East, Caucasus, and Central Asia Studies at the Higher School of Economics. He believes that the sultan may have relayed the US and Iran's shared position on Russia's involvement in the revised nuclear deal: "Russia's potential role is to be a facilitator or mediator between the US and Iran, specifically regarding the deal. For most other matters, there are international bodies and the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in the Hague. Moreover, based on earlier media reports, Moscow might assume responsibility for certain technical elements of the deal, such as transferring nuclear fuel from Iran to Russia."

Sergey Balmasov, an expert at the Institute of the Middle East, agrees that the Iranian nuclear issue was central to the talks. Currently, Oman's capital acts as a bridge between Tehran and Western nations, while Moscow is actively engaged in supporting Iran's peaceful nuclear pursuits, the expert noted.

"Evidently, the US-Iran dialogue on the nuclear issue has not yet yielded any significant advancement, due to the entrenched positions of both parties. Oman is therefore counting on Russia's help in achieving a potential breakthrough in the negotiations. Tehran is unlikely to accept a new deal modeled on the previous one without firm guarantees of its enforcement," the expert explained.

Oman has long played the role of a go-between for Iran and the West, said Murad Sadygzade, president of the Center for Middle East Research: "The recent visits to Moscow by the Qatari emir and Omani sultan are connected to the ongoing Middle East dynamics, as these countries aim to reduce the risk of a major regional conflict, which could bring significant economic and political consequences for the Middle East and North Africa, including the Persian Gulf states."

All these matters are part of the dialogue—from Syria to Iran, from regional stability to a new security framework, the expert said: "Russia, as one of the key players in the Middle East, could become one of the guarantors of a new Iranian accord, similar to its role in the previous JCPOA agreement," Sadygzade noted. He emphasized that Moscow is among the most trusted international actors by Tehran, and Iran may view Russia as a reliable mediator.

An emerging easing of tensions between Moscow and Washington also points to some encouraging signs, the expert observed: "If a Ukraine agreement is reached and ties between Moscow and Washington are renewed, Russia could become a neutral broker to assist with the US-Iran negotiations." In this light, Oman retains significance, as since 2013 it has proven its value as a trusted mediator in global conflicts—by the Iranians, Americans, and Saudis alike—having played a role in facilitating the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Sadygzade added.

 

In the near future, US President Donald Trump is expected to unveil his strategy for resolving the Ukrainian conflict, which may involve the deployment of European forces in Ukraine following a truce between Moscow and Kiev, a senior White House official told the New York Post (NYP).

It is anticipated that the US will present the specifics of its peace initiative to the Russian leadership during a visit by US Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff. According to Russian Presidential Aide Yury Ushakov, Witkoff is scheduled to visit Moscow this week.

Russia is unlikely to accept the stationing of European troops in the conflict area, believes Alexander Kamkin, an associate professor at the Financial University. According to him, such a development would revert the Russian-Ukrainian crisis to the dynamics of the Minsk-2 agreement, while Kiev would still be supplied with arms. That said, the expert did not exclude the possibility of positioning Europeans along the line of contact as part of a UN peacekeeping force. "The US is more invested than anyone in having European troops in Ukraine, primarily to safeguard their investments and infrastructure through a proxy," the political scientist added.

The presence of European soldiers in Ukraine remains unacceptable for Moscow, agrees Lev Sokolshchik, a researcher at the HSE Center for Comprehensive Economic and Social Studies. This proposal mainly reflects American interests, allowing Washington to reduce expenditures on Ukraine by transferring this responsibility to Europe, the expert noted: "Moscow has consistently opposed this plan, arguing that the deployment of NATO troops in Ukraine is the underlying cause of the conflict.

The most favorable scenario for Russia would be the establishment of peacekeeping forces and a joint committee including Russian, Ukrainian, and other delegates. In theory, representatives from the SCO or BRICS could serve as the third party."

However, even with such a structure, the peace process would remain fragile, since, according to Sokolshchik, it would not rule out ongoing provocations from both Ukraine and European countries.

 

Russia is prepared to involve observers from the US and other nations in investigations into crimes allegedly committed by Ukrainian forces, Rodion Miroshnik, the Russian Foreign Ministry's special envoy, told Izvestia. Their role may include ensuring openness in the investigation process and legal proceedings. Since 2014, the Russian Investigative Committee has initiated over 6,500 criminal cases related to war crimes, with more than 500 individuals already convicted. Experts believe various countries could participate in monitoring investigations into the actions of the Ukrainian military.

The US was backing and supporting the Kiev regime during the Biden administration. However, with Donald Trump's return, Washington has been reassessing its position on Russia and engaging in dialogue with Moscow. For example, this was evident during the contentious vote against an anti-Russian resolution at the UN General Assembly. As a result, the US might now be open to joining efforts to investigate Ukrainian war crimes, Deputy Director of the Institute of History and Politics at Moscow State Pedagogical University Vladimir Shapovalov told Izvestia.

The necessity of ensuring accountability for breaches of international law will be part of any potential peace agreements on Ukraine, Miroshnik stated in his interview with the newspaper.

There is a long-standing precedent for representatives from different nations taking part in investigations into war crimes and crimes against humanity, such as genocide. Most countries are interested in observing this process — except those actively backing the Kiev regime. The International Public Tribunal on Ukraine is already operating in Russia, yet according to Shapovalov, a new international body to investigate Ukrainian war crimes must be established.

 

Japan has shifted its attitude toward concluding a peace treaty with Russia following the onset of talks between Russia and the US. Tokyo intends to reopen peace treaty negotiations with Moscow "as soon as the situation allows," the Japanese Embassy told Izvestia. This is a notable change in rhetoric, since previously Tokyo only mentioned the intention to return to the discussion. This may be linked to Japan anticipating the conclusion of the Ukraine conflict in order to lift anti-Russian sanctions and create a more favorable climate for negotiations, experts believe. The Russian side has repeatedly stated that it is ready for dialogue only if Tokyo abandons its hostile policy course. That said, so far no shifts in Japan's foreign policy can be perceived, with reports that the country's authorities have decided to share satellite data with the Ukrainian Defense Ministry Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR).

"Japan is waiting for the Ukraine conflict to be resolved. Moreover, I can confirm that in private conversations, Japanese diplomats mention that following the conflict's resolution, Japan will be ready for a full restoration of ties with Russia and the lifting of sanctions," Vladimir Nelidov, senior researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Oriental Studies, told Izvestia.

Given the improvement in general relations following the end of the conflict, the talks on the peace agreement may indeed restart, the expert noted.

"There is an impression of uncertainty in Japan's foreign policy course with regard to Russia. On the one hand, given the Russia-US thaw, common sense suggests the need to reengage in dialogue with Russia, which is important from the perspective of energy and food security, as well as the interests of car manufacturers who may be affected by new US tariffs. On the other hand, Japan continues with a wait-and-see approach," Olga Dobrinskaya, senior researcher with the Center of Japanese Studies at the Institute of China and Contemporary Asia of the Russian Academy of Sciences, noted in the conversation with the newspaper.

"Japanese companies are exploring their options since certain progress has appeared toward a political resolution of the crisis. They are generally quite pragmatic and disinclined to take risks. If the overall environment for the operations of foreign companies in Russia improves and the risks of secondary sanctions decline, a new wave will begin — and Japanese companies will be among the first to return," Nelidov noted.

 

Gold prices have risen by another $100 over 24 hours, reaching another milestone of $3,500 per ounce. The increase outpaced forecasts by analysts and investment banks and theoretically, gold may hit the $4,000 mark before the end of this year.

One of the main reasons for the rapid rise of gold prices is the trade war initiated by Donald Trump in early April. "Trade wars exacerbate the global uncertainty, increase the risks of global recession, fuel trends toward de-globalization and fragmentation of the global economy. As a result, investors are actively turning to safe-haven assets, such as gold and the Swiss franc," said Sovcombank Chief Analyst Mikhail Vasilyev.

According to him, an additional trigger emerged last week, when reports broke out that Trump wants to fire Jerome Powell, chair of the US Federal Reserve, and force the Fed to lower interest rates. "This increases the risks of the US Central Bank losing its independence which further undermines investors' trust in US assets, the dollar and the current dollar-centric financial system," Vasilyev added.

There is also a new factor which seriously affected the current surge in prices. "We are observing that the inflows of funds to gold exchange-traded funds have reached a record-setting level last week, substantially surpassing decade-old highs," Tsifra Broker analyst Ivan Yefanov explained.

Vasilyev believes that gold may continue climbing in price while Trump is negotiating the tariffs and putting pressure on the Fed. "If the global uncertainty due to Trump's policy continues to grow, then gold may rise to $3,800-4,000 per ounce in the coming months," he concluded.

President Donald Trump's bold move to hike tariffs on Chinese goods to 145 percent—met by Beijing's 125 percent retaliation—has reignited a national debate over trade, economic independence, and the future of U.S. industry.

A new poll of 18,438 Epoch Times readers shows broad support for Trump's tough stance against the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and its decades-long record of exploiting global trade to the detriment of U.S. manufacturing and national security.

The tariffs target what Trump calls the CCP's predatory tactics: currency manipulation, intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers, and market-warping state subsidies that systematically disadvantage U.S. businesses.

By zeroing in on strategic sectors such as steel, technology, and critical minerals, the administration's trade overhaul aims to close the U.S.–China trade gap, fortify national security, and bring manufacturing back to U.S. soil.

On April 2, Trump imposed a 10 percent baseline tariff on nearly all imports. For roughly 60 countries with large trade surpluses with the United States, he introduced steeper reciprocal tariffs. China, at the top of that list, faces tariffs as high as 245 percent on some products.

When asked whether the 145 percent tariff on Chinese goods is a justified step to hold Beijing accountable, 72 percent of readers strongly agreed that it is, and 13 percent somewhat agreed. Four percent were neutral and a combined 11 percent disagreed.

While some respondents expressed concern about the potential harm to U.S. exporters and consumers, most said they remained unfazed. Twenty-three percent said they agreed—strongly or somewhat—that Beijing's retaliation would cause serious harm, while 34 percent were neutral and 43 percent disagreed.

At the same time, signs of strain are emerging within China itself. Exporters, factory owners, and industry observers have voiced growing alarm as profit margins vanish, orders dry up, and job losses mount.

Critics of Beijing's response argue that the CCP's failure to negotiate may backfire, deepening China's economic isolation just as other nations seek new trade terms with Washington.

A clear majority of readers supported the electronics exemption, with 32 percent strongly agreeing and another 32 percent somewhat agreeing that it was a prudent move. Twelve percent disagreed to some extent, while 24 percent remained neutral.

When asked whether the price of electronics is likely to rise despite the exemption, 23 percent strongly agreed and 40 percent somewhat agreed that it is—meaning a total of 63 percent believe to some degree that prices will rise despite the exemption. Twenty-eight percent were neutral, 6 percent somewhat disagreed, and 3 percent strongly disagreed.

China, which dominates the rare earth mineral market and mines roughly 60 percent of the world's total supply, has imposed export controls on these essential elements as part of its response to the Trump administration's tariffs.

Rare earth metals are a group of 17 essential elements that are critical in many modern technologies, both civilian and military. Securing supply chains for these elements, which have no practical substitutes, has been a priority for Trump as he seeks to strengthen the United States' manufacturing base.

On the issue of China's dominance in rare earth minerals and critical components, 52 percent of respondents said they strongly agree—and 19 percent somewhat agree—that this poses a serious risk to U.S. national security. Fourteen percent were neutral, 8 percent somewhat disagreed, and 7 percent strongly disagreed.

Trump's tariffs are intended to reverse this decades-long decline by shielding domestic industries from the CCP's trade abuses. The effort has raised a fundamental question: Are Americans willing to do factory work in a country where the workforce has largely shifted toward service sector and office jobs?

According to the poll, the answer is yes. A strong majority—74 percent—said they believe that Americans are willing to return to factory jobs if those opportunities come back. Fifteen percent were neutral, while 11 percent expressed skepticism.

Respondents also emphasized the critical role of education and job training. Half of all participants strongly agreed that the United States cannot rebuild a strong manufacturing base without serious reforms in vocational and technical education. An additional 25 percent somewhat agreed, while 15 percent expressed disagreement or uncertainty.

Respondents also showed strong support for education and vocational training reform as a foundation for rebuilding the domestic industry. Half of all respondents said they strongly agree that without serious reforms in education and job training, the United States cannot rebuild a strong manufacturing base. Twenty-five percent somewhat agreed, 10 percent were neutral, 8 percent somewhat disagreed, and 7 percent strongly disagreed.

However, when asked whether a lack of skilled labor and waning interest in factory work is a greater obstacle than policy or taxes, opinion was more divided. While 41 percent agreed that it is, 25 percent were neutral, and 34 percent disagreed—suggesting that many see government policy as the more significant barrier to reshoring U.S. manufacturing.

“At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable,” he said.

Although Trump has offered to lower tariffs if Beijing engages in serious negotiations, the CCP has shown little interest in compromise.

When asked whether the Chinese regime would change course without sustained economic pressure, an overwhelming 86 percent of poll respondents agreed that it would, with 75 percent strongly agreeing. Nine percent disagreed, and 4 percent were neutral.

In contrast, there was little faith in diplomacy alone. Seventeen percent said they believe that alliances and diplomatic engagement offer a better long-term strategy for confronting the CCP, while 70 percent disagreed.

By contrast, 10 percent strongly agreed that diplomacy and alliances—not tariffs—are the better long-term path to confronting Beijing. Seven percent somewhat agreed, while 13 percent were neutral, 26 percent somewhat disagreed, and 44 percent strongly disagreed.

The poll also revealed a near-unanimous view that China's track record—on intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers, and product dumping—has undermined global trade fairness. Eighty-four percent strongly agreed, and another 6 percent somewhat agreed. Six percent disagreed.

Poll results show overwhelming support for that vision. Eighty-nine percent of respondents said that rebuilding manufacturing is critical to national strength and global leadership, while 7 percent disagreed.

When asked which factors are most critical to bringing manufacturing back, respondents pointed to education, tax policy, and cultural values. Eighty-one percent cited better technical education and job training, 78 percent favored tax and regulatory incentives for reshoring, and 72 percent emphasized the need to restore respect for skilled labor. Sixty-four percent supported a more competitive overall tax and regulatory environment, while 60 percent identified stronger tariffs and trade enforcement. Respondents could select multiple answers.

There was clear frustration with what many described as an underprepared, over-entitled workforce. Readers also expressed concern that the “college for all” mindset has undermined the value of skilled trades. Some called for banning social media in classrooms, dismantling the Department of Education, and returning to character-based instruction rooted in discipline, patriotism, and a good work ethic.

While energy policy, government incentives, and cultural attitudes were also mentioned, education was repeatedly cited as the root challenge—and the key to the United States' industrial revival.

Suggestions included steep and escalating tariffs—some as high as 500 percent—total economic decoupling, and bans on Chinese imports. Others called for removing Chinese nationals involved in espionage or influence operations. Several respondents blamed decades of U.S. corporate and political naivete for empowering Beijing at the expense of U.S. industry and sovereignty.

While many still championed bringing key industries—such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and defense—back to U.S. soil, others emphasized that modern manufacturing is increasingly automated. They warned against nostalgic ideas of factory floors packed with workers, and instead pushed for strategic planning focused on innovation, high-tech infrastructure, and workforce readiness.

Several respondents also noted that reshoring would likely raise consumer prices, and that a cultural shift—toward valuing industrial work and recognizing the changing nature of manufacturing in the 21st century—will be necessary.

Together, the poll results and written responses reflect more than support for Trump's tariff strategy—they reveal a deeper desire for structural reform, cultural renewal, and national resilience.

For many Epoch Times readers, restoring U.S. manufacturing is about more than just jobs or economics—it's about rebuilding the foundations of American strength, independence, and identity.

Evidence filed by Trans Mountain with the Canadian Energy Regulator shows that the proposed tolls to ship oil to China are $9.19 per barrel higher than shipping on an Enbridge pipeline to the U.S. Gulf.JASON FRANSON/The Canadian Press

Thomas Gunton is professor and founding director of the Resource and Environmental Planning Program at Simon Fraser University and recently completed a report for the International Institute for Sustainable Development on the Trans Mountain Pipeline.

The upending of international trade by the Trump administration has posed an existential crisis for Canada.

But while there is a consensus that we need new strategies to confront the threat, we need to be careful that we do not simply make things worse by ill-advised initiatives cobbled together in the heat of the crisis.

Nowhere is this truer than in the energy sector, where one of the proposed solutions is to streamline the review process and build more pipelines to allow our energy exports to be shipped to other markets.

While such a strategy has intuitive appeal, it would end up being a costly blunder that would do more harm than good to the Canadian economy.

The problem is that the world demand for oil will peak by 2030 and then begin to decline. No one knows for sure what the rate of decline will be, but both the International Energy Agency and private oil companies such as BP forecast a small to significant decline as high as 75 per cent by 2050, depending on future climate policies.

In this environment, investing in a major expansion of oil production in Canada, which is among the highest-cost producers in the world, is highly risky, especially given the unused low-cost oil production capacity in the Middle East.

And even if Canadian production increases, the Canadian Energy Regulator concludes that there is sufficient pipeline capacity in place – with minor low-cost expansions of existing pipelines – to meet even their most optimistic demand forecast.

In this environment, building new pipelines to diversify our export markets would simply duplicate existing pipelines we have already built that ship oil to the United States.

But building new pipelines to divert oil shipments from the U.S. would not be worth the benefits for several reasons.

First, even under the most expedited approval process it would still take at least four to five years to build a pipeline, thus providing no benefit in the foreseeable future or for the duration of the Trump presidency.

Second, the costs of duplicating existing pipelines would be enormous. The expanded Trans Mountain pipeline, for example, cost just over $34-billion to add 590,000 barrels per day of new capacity. At this rate, diverting all four mb/d exports shipped to the U.S. would cost $235-billion and building this new capacity, let alone financing it, would be prohibitive.

And even if we were able to add major new capacity at a slower rate, the incremental shipment costs would be higher than any likely long-term tariffs on Canadian oil exports.

Evidence filed by Trans Mountain with the Canadian Energy Regulator shows that the proposed tolls to ship oil to China are $9.19 per barrel higher than shipping on an Enbridge pipeline to the U.S. Gulf, even at the taxpayer-subsidized tolls that cover less than half the cost to build the pipeline.

If the full costs are covered in the tolls, which they would be in any new pipeline, the cost of shipping to China could be between about $13 to $22 per barrel higher than the U.S. Gulf, (depending on the method used to determine tolls).

At the average 2024 Western Canadian Select price of around $87 per barrel, producers would have to receive between 15 per cent and 25 per cent less per barrel shipped to the U.S. for the entire 40-year operating life of the pipeline before they would consider building one.

And that is based on the unlikely assumption that the existing pipelines would not lower tolls to retain shippers.

This is why no private company has proposed building a new pipeline and will not consider the option without a massive taxpayer subsidy, even if the review process is streamlined.

Canada exports about 80 per cent of its five mb/d oil production to the U.S., and the ability to shift these exports to other destinations is limited and not cost-effective.

It may have made sense to diversify export markets when the original pipeline infrastructure was being planned, or if there are any future expansions, but the die has been cast for oil. The infrastructure was built to serve the U.S. market given its proximity, and the age of expansion for oil and new major pipelines is over.

Canada needs to diversify its exports and strengthen its economy by, for example, removing internal trade barriers, investing in energy conservation and expanding interprovincial electricity infrastructure to meet the growing demand for clean energy. Clearly, we would be better off using our scarce capital on these and other needed investments with a higher return and negotiating the removal of tariffs instead of building duplicate pipeline capacity that will make us worse off.

Containers at the Yantian port in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, on April 17.Tingshu Wang/Reuters

Beijing has welcomed signs the U.S. is second-guessing its aggressive approach to China, following weeks of escalating reciprocal tariffs and bilateral tensions.

Markets were buoyed Tuesday on remarks U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made to a private investment conference in Washington, in which he predicted a U.S.-China trade deal in the “very near future,” saying “neither side thinks the status quo is sustainable.”

Asked about Mr. Bessent's comments later in the day, President Donald Trump said the current 145 per cent tariff on all Chinese goods will “come down substantially,” the latest dramatic U-turn in his global trade war.

At a regular news conference Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun reiterated Beijing's long-standing point that “there are no winners in a tariff war or a trade war.”

“China's attitude is very clear,” Mr. Guo said. “We do not want to fight, but nor are we afraid to. If forced to fight, we will do so to the end. When it comes to talks, our door is wide open.”

In his remarks to investors, Mr. Bessent predicted negotiations with Beijing “will be a slog,” but said that, nevertheless, “over the very near future, there will be a de-escalation, and I think that should give the world, the markets, a sigh of relief.”

Indeed it did, with the S&P 500 stock index rising 2.5 per cent and Asian markets trading upwards on Wednesday on reports of Mr. Bessent's speech.

The President was also more optimistic than his Treasury Secretary, saying he believed a trade deal could happen “pretty quickly,” adding he would not “play hardball” during negotiations.

“They're gonna do very well, and I think they're going to be happy, and we're gonna live together very happily and ideally work together,” he said.

During Mr. Trump's first term, the U.S. and China spent months negotiating a phase one trade deal, which was never fully implemented, with Washington instead slapping tariffs on many Chinese goods, sparking a trade war.

That dispute was nothing compared to the escalation seen since January, however, with both sides ratcheting up reciprocal tariffs to the point where a full economic decoupling seemed inevitable.

Throughout, Mr. Trump had encouraged China to come to the table, even suggesting Chinese leader Xi Jinping was keen to make a deal, but Beijing showed no signs of blinking, publicly dismissing the threat of U.S. tariffs and seeking to build ties with partners in Europe and Southeast Asia. This approach was bolstered by Mr. Trump's “Liberation Day” tariffs on almost every country in the world, which alienated U.S. trading partners, helping China advance itself as the more responsible global player.

When Washington paused most tariffs, some Trump administration officials tried to paint the move as a deliberate tactic to isolate China, and Beijing did show some concern that countries would agree to tariff Chinese goods in return for relief from U.S. measures, warning Monday that “China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests.”

The costs of Mr. Trump's global trade war have been piling up in recent weeks, with stocks and U.S. treasuries trading lower and lower, sparking growing criticism, with even some supporters of the President publicly doubting his strategy.

On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund forecast economic growth will slow to 2.8 per cent this year globally, compared to 3.3 per cent in 2024.

Last week, a group of leading economists published an open letter warning Mr. Trump's tariffs “have injected uncertainty and chaos into the global economy through wildly fluctuating rates and ever-changing orders,” and represented the “largest tax increase on trade in almost a century.”

That letter – which now has more than 1,500 signatories – was widely reported on in China, where state media has often focused on the cost of Mr. Trump's measures to U.S. business and consumers, while dismissing any potential risk to the Chinese economy.

Speaking to the state-run Global Times on Wednesday, Bao Jianyun, a professor of international studies at Renmin University in Beijing, said Washington's “seemingly softening tone underscores that the U.S. tariff policy has shown a significant discrepancy between its actual outcomes and its initial goals.”

Prof. Bao added that Mr. Trump's frequent flip-flopping on tariffs had reduced his credibility, but said “the U.S. goal of containing and suppressing China will not change.”

Beijing has struggled to establish a reliable back channel with the Trump administration as it had Joe Biden's, during whose term tensions were often high but talks continued on multiple issues, including topics important to Mr. Trump, such as cracking down on fentanyl.

Mr. Trump's team reportedly rebuffed an initial reach out by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, regarding him as not influential enough with Mr. Xi. Beijing has also been offended by public comments from Trump administration officials, including Vice-President JD Vance describing Chinese workers as “peasants.”

Speaking Wednesday, Mr. Guo, the Foreign Ministry official, said any dialogue must be “on an equal footing, with respect and on a mutually beneficial basis.”

“Saying that it wants to reach an agreement with China while constantly imposing maximum pressure is not the correct way to deal with China and will not work.”

As Dana White, the straight-talking president of the UFC, strolled through the Kaseya Center in Miami, flanked on one side by Donald Trump and Elon Musk on the other last weekend, the crowd leapt to its feet.

While one would not normally expect to see the leader of the free world and one of his top advisers – who also happens to be the world's “richest man” – strolling through scenes of bloodied knockouts and half-naked staredowns, it was not unusual for Mr Trump, or fans of UFC.

In fact, the cheers from the blood-thirsty crowd were arguably louder and more emotionally charged than what you might expect to see at CPAC or a Trump rally.

Over the past decade, the UFC has evolved from a fringe combat league – once denounced by the late Republican senator John McCain as “human cockfighting” – into one of America's most influential cultural platforms.

It has become an arena where traditional masculinity is openly celebrated. It's a place where cancel culture goes to die, and where the chaotic, transformative energy of Maga is palpable.

At its centre is White, who rescued the company from bankruptcy in the early 2000s and transformed it into a multi-billion dollar global enterprise.

Over the past five years in particular, White has emerged as a kind of cultural kingmaker, one whose alliance with the president has redefined the UFC as more than a typical sports brand.

It is now a sanctuary for a specific kind of American identity: patriotic, macho, libertarian, and anti-woke.

Mr Trump has always been in the UFC's orbit. In fact, he was one of the few figures who offered White a platform in the sport's early days, allowing events to be hosted at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City when others refused.

White has seemingly never forgotten the gesture.

He spoke at both the 2016 and 2020 Republican conventions. Then, last November, after Trump's re-election victory, the UFC boss joined Mr Trump and his family on stage in Florida to celebrate.

Throughout the course of the election, Mr Trump used UFC events to sidestep traditional media.

The optics were carefully constructed: red-carpet entrances, handshakes with voters, and perhaps most importantly, friendly faces in the front row.

Joe Rogan, who endorsed Mr Trump, has been commentating for the UFC for decades. Andrew Schulz, who welcomed the president on his podcast, is also a regular attender. Even Andrew Tate was welcomed last month as if he wasn't under investigation for alleged sexual assault and human trafficking.

In short, this is where the “bro vote”, which helped elect Mr Trump, hangs out.

It's here chronically-online, often politically uncommitted Gen Z men who helped Mr Trump find viral fame on TikTok, and soaked up his messaging on podcasts, mix with politics.

Young white men aged between 18 and 29 voted overwhelmingly for Mr Trump, with 64 per cent of the demographic opting for the Republican, according to Tufts.

The Tufts data shows that, overall, the Republican party saw more youth votes than in 2020 – 30 per cent compared to 39 per cent last year.

Young men of colour also voted for Mr Trump in droves. There was an increase of 20 per cent in the number of black men who opted for Mr Trump, while young Latino men saw a jump of 14 per cent.

“You're getting conversations in these podcasts, and you yourself, as a young kid, get to really see who Donald Trump is,” White told The New Yorker of the media strategy. “Not the bulls--- you hear from the far-Left media.”

White's positioning against “legacy” media is not accidental. He kept heavyweight champion Jon Jones on the roster despite multiple arrests for domestic violence and driving under the influence.

He continued to back Conor McGregor after the Irishman was found liable for rape in a civil court. Mr Trump also recently met with McGregor at the White House, and suggested he was his “favourite” Irish person, despite the court's ruling.

White himself was filmed slapping his wife on New Year's Eve 2022, an incident that might have ended a career in another industry. But in the UFC universe, such moments are not only survivable, they are often framed as part of the brand's unvarnished realism. He later released a statement saying: “There's never, ever an excuse for a guy to put his hands on a woman.”

White's influence also appears to stretch beyond the cage. Earlier this month, Mr Trump revealed during a cabinet meeting that White had been instrumental in securing the release of Ksenia Karelina, a Russian-American ballerina arrested in Moscow and charged with treason over a $51 donation to a Ukraine-related charity.

She had faced up to 12 years in prison. White brought the case to Mr Trump's attention, after Karelina's fiancé – professional boxer Chris van Heerden – contacted him.

Shortly after, a prisoner swap was arranged.

It was a sign that White now operates in the realm of diplomacy, although unofficially.

He may not be a politician, but he is clearly no longer just a sports executive. His transformation draws parallels with Mr Musk.

In January, White was appointed to the board of Meta, where he will help “shape the future of social media and AI”.

Internationally, his power has also grown. The UFC has staged major events in Saudi Arabia, which is now playing a central role in negotiations to end the war in Ukraine and was set to be Mr Trump's first international visit, before it was announced he was to attend the Pope's funeral in Rome on Saturday.

White also secured lucrative partnerships to host fights in the UAE, with Mr Trump set to visit the country as part of a mini middle-eastern tour in May.

The UFC president may say he has no desire to run for office, having expressed a deep disdain for the “disgusting” world of politics after Mr Trump's comeback victory in November.

But unlike Musk, it appears White, and his world of UFC, can wield influence far from Washington DC.

It is this extraordinary ability to get inside the minds of both Mr Trump and his supporters that propels the sport, its fans and its fighters to such a unique position within Maga circles.

It could take up to five years to develop a domestic supply chain to supplant China's global monopoly in processing rare earths into materials needed to produce everything from iPhones to F-35 fighter jets.

While the United States has most of the 17 rare earth elements and 50 critical minerals underground, it has no industrial capacity to refine them into processed metals and magnets, according to Melissa “Mel” Sanderson, American Rare Earths board member and Critical Minerals Institute co-chair.

“Currently in the United States, we have zero magnet manufacturers,” Sanderson told The Epoch Times.

“I certainly hope, as the administration is working through this critical area—no pun intended, it's a critical area—they realize there's this vulnerability gap, a four to five year gap, no matter how you look at it, in terms of ramping up domestic production,” Sanderson said.

Trump's April 2 order gives Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick 180 days to suggest how the federal government can help develop a “circular” domestic rare earth supply chain.

The president is also pondering an order allowing deep-sea mining and commercial stockpiling.

Whatever the administration does, with enough permit reform, deregulation, and public-private incentivizing, industry will respond, economist Antonio Graceffo told The Epoch Times.

“The short answer is if China bans the sale of rare earth minerals to the United States” permanently, “that's a positive thing because it's going to force the United States to find a solution,” he said.

An analyst who writes about U.S.–China trade relations for The Epoch Times, Graceffo said there are “tons of solutions” to building a domestic rare earth supply chain, including the ongoing negotiations with Ukraine.

“Absolutely, we can overcome the problem,” he said. “In the long run, it's going to be much better if China cuts us off. [Industry] will definitely find a way.”

Colorado School of Mines economics professor Ian Lange agrees. “I'm on the optimistic side,” he said.

Lange said there are substitute materials for the seven restricted rare earths, and some manufacturers are telling him they'll survive without them.

He questioned if China can sustain its rare earth export restrictions because American industries are their biggest market.

“We'll see if this is a real or just another hoop to jump through,” Lange told The Epoch Times. “And we have been slowly building up the supply chain over the last couple years.

“We're getting close to having something here in the United States.”

It will also process dysprosium and terbium, two of the seven restricted “heavies,” by building a refinery near its Halleck Creek mine outside Wheatland, Wyoming. Dysprosium is used in magnets incorporated in motors and generators for wind turbines, electrical vehicles, and nuclear reactor control rods. Terbium compounds are used in electronics, semiconductors, and fluorescent lighting.

Also in Wyoming, Ramaco Resources is breaking ground on an estimated 1.5 billion-ton rare earth deposit and pilot processing plant at its Brook Mine, while Rare Element Resources has started “proprietary processing and separation operations” at its Bear Lodge demonstration plant in Upton.

Oklahoma-based USA Rare Earths, which is opening a “neo-magnet” factory this year, produced its first sample of dysprosium oxide from its Round Top, Texas, mine this year and processed it at its research plant in Wheat Ridge, Colorado.

Ucore Rare Metals is developing the Louisiana Strategic Metals Complex in Alexandria with $20 million in state incentives, and Energy Fuels, a uranium mining company, is processing monazite sands to extract rare earths at its White Mesa Mill in Utah.

Both are Canadian-owned corporations.

The two most prominent rare earth operators in the United States are Australia's Lynas Rare Earths, the world's largest rare earth developer outside China, and Las Vegas-based MP Materials Corp.

Both are crucial in processing rare earths for the U.S. Department of Defense, which is midway through a five-year plan to build a “sustainable mine-to-magnet supply chain” to support its needs by 2027.

The Pentagon said in January it doubled its initial project request beyond military requirements to “strengthen supply chain resilience for … burgeoning high-tech industry as well as … national security needs.”

In 2024, MP Materials achieved an all-time U.S. high output at Mountain Pass, delivering more than 45,000 metric tons of rare earth oxides and refined products.

The output included a U.S. record of 1,300 tons of neodymium-praseodymium oxide, key elements in “permanent magnets,” which retain their magnetic strength for decades.

“This milestone marks a major step forward in restoring a fully integrated rare earth magnet supply chain in the United States,” MP Materials CEO and founder James Litinsky said in a January statement.

“We have reached a significant turning point for MP and U.S. competitiveness in a vital sector.”

Yet, both Lynas Rare Earth and MP Materials produce more rare earth ore than they can process. To sustain operations, they must export much of what they excavate.

“MP is basically China's largest offshore supplier” of rare earth ore, Critical Minerals Institute Executive Chair Jack Lifton said, noting China-based Shanghai Resources Industrial & Trading Co. bought 32,000 tons worth $350 million from MP Materials in 2024.

MP Materials did not return phone calls or email interview requests.

If China has to pay a 145 percent tariff to export processed rare earth minerals to the United States, “it would be financial suicide to keep that [export pace] up because they couldn't do it—it would cost them more than it's worth,” Lifton told The Epoch Times.

Meredith Schwartz, research associate at the Center for Strategic & International Studies's Project on Critical Minerals Security, said Lynas, despite being the largest producer outside China, still sends oxides to China because it does not have enough refining capacity.

“But even when these facilities are fully operational” at MP Materials and Lynas in the United States, they are nowhere near commercial capacity and dwarfed by China's output, Schwartz said.

While MP Materials produced 1,300 tons of neodymium-praseodymium oxide in 2024, “in the same year, China produced an estimated 300,000 tons,” she said.

Progress is being made, but there are setbacks and challenges, Schwartz said, noting that while USA Rare Earths

called purifying its first dysprosium oxide “a breakthrough” for the domestic rare earths industry, “significant work remains to turn production of samples in a laboratory into full-scale commercial production.”

“Even with recent investments the United States is a long way off from meeting the [Department of Defense] goal for a mine-to-magnet supply chain independent of China, and is even further from rivaling foreign adversaries in this strategic industry,” she said.

“Developing mining and processing capabilities requires a long-term effort, meaning the United States will be on the back foot for the foreseeable future.”

It recommends Congress incentivize domestic production of rare earth magnets through tax breaks to U.S. manufacturers, which Graceffo endorses as long as it comes with long-awaited permit reform.

“It's going to be a matter of Trump repealing or rolling back some of the environmental restrictions, and probably some of our allies doing the same thing,” he said, suggesting American manufacturers will develop efficiencies to produce better, less-expensive products.

“Once you bring those things back home, you've got all those great minds, all those educated people, motivated by profit. It's actually going to advance technological development because we're going to find even better ways to do things,” Graceffo said.

“When you're paying $25, $30 an hour to factory workers, you're very incentivized to find more efficient ways to do things rather than when you're in China paying 8 cents an hour.”

Sanderson said the Trump administration “is doing a heroic effort in addressing major pinch points that have affected the industry chronically in this country for the last 50 years or so.”

She said permitting reform is the first of those pinch points.

“The system is antiquated, inefficient, and subject to excessive litigation, which is what keeps good projects on the chalkboard for 20-plus years,” she said. “So they're addressing that. They're removing those barriers.”

Lifton said the Trump administration must establish a China-free “organized market” for rare earths. He's surprised industry groups haven't already done so.

“There's no common thread, no common ground organization. You'd think, for example, the car companies all get together and say, ‘Listen, we're not going to talk about our competitive [issues], relative costs, what our next year's model looks like, we're going to talk about common sourcing of rare earth permanent magnet motors because we all need that,'” he said.

Sanderson said another rare earth pinch point being addressed by the administration is a new “form of private public partnership” using Development Finance Corp. and Department of Defense money “to serve as an anchor for attracting private investment.”

American Rare Earths, for instance, received its $456 million authorization from the U.S. Export-Import Bank through the president's executive actions mandating supply chain resiliency, she said.

“The Ex-Im Bank was never set up to fund these projects” until it was directed to do so by the president.

Under the administration's changes, a mine project doesn't need a customer “guaranteed to buy all or a portion of the output,” to qualify for grants and loans, which makes the process faster, Sanderson said.

Financing is an issue in the mining industry, but of acute concern in rare earths development, she said.

“You found a lot of nice rocks in the ground. Goody for you. Now you need to be funded to transform yourself into an actual mining company,” she said. “U.S. banks don't tend to lend to that.”

Rare earth mining and processing is “extremely capital intensive and once you have invested and you have started with the operations … these guys, they won't invest if they don't see they're going to be operating the mine for 10 or 20 years,” said Didier Lesueur, CEO of the Western Research Institute in Laramie, Wyoming.

Lifton said “big capital is not interested” in rare earths. He noted that corporate global mining companies such as Rio Tinto don't want to mine rare earths.

“So, no matter how much you talk about this, it's a small business” in the context of the mining industry, he said.

Extracting rare earths from “host rocks” is “a black art kind of thing. It's proprietary, a lot of proprietary operations. Nobody tells you exactly how they do things, and even when they do, you need to be a super specialist to understand,” Lifton said.

There are many expensive steps between the ground and the market, “and by the way, you have to dig up the stuff … that's very expensive,” he said.

Sanderson said it's difficult to extract the rare earths from within the material they're embedded “and concentrate that to a level that makes the project economically viable.”

“Not all deposits ‘concentrate' sufficiently to make them bankable,” she said.

Timelines are also difficult to benchmark in rare earths development, she said.

“Any estimate any company gives—in any industry for that matter—on when they think a new plant or a new mine or a new processing facility is going to come online, is always a best-guess estimate based on a best-case scenario—where the supply chain doesn't collapse, the price doesn't become unmanageable, the weather cooperates, yada yada, yada yada.”

Nevertheless, Lifton said, with more than $400 billion in tax credits and other incentives available through 2022's Inflation Reduction Act—at least for now—“Washington is floating on money for these projects.”

Lesueur said building a domestic rare earth supply chain will take time, and it's worth taking the time to get it right.

“Can it be done rapidly? No,” he said. “Sustainably? Yes. It takes time because most of these projects, such as American Rare Earth's Halleck Creek mine, are “green field projects” meaning, they're starting from scratch.

Right now, the nation's rare earths industry is “just small stuff in a big spot of land,” Sanderson said. “But hey, you start small and you grow, right?”

Big changes in tax returns from year to year can attract auditors' attention.Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press

Being selected for an audit by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) doesn't necessarily result in penalties or more taxes owed. But audits take time, and it's safe to assume most taxpayers and business owners can come up with any number of activities they'd prefer to being audited.

While the CRA doesn't publish detailed audit statistics, the good news is the chance of being audited is relatively small for employees who haven't bought or sold property or claimed losses, says Anna Malazhavaya, founder and tax lawyer at Advotax Law Professional Corp. in Toronto. 

The probabilities she's heard discussed at Canadian Tax Foundation conferences rise to about 2 per cent for small businesses and 7 per cent for medium-sized companies.

“The best advice I can give to an individual or a business owner who wants to avoid being audited is to hire a very good accountant and share all the information with that professional. Just tell the truth,” Ms. Malazhavaya says. 

That said, there are red flags individual taxpayers and business owners should avoid when possible:

Be careful with real estate transactions: The CRA's real estate tax force was established in 2019 to focus on tax non-compliance in the Greater Toronto and Greater Vancouver real estate markets. 

“Auditors analyze real estate transaction data, and they normally select people who sold a real estate property relatively soon after they purchased it or after construction work was done on the property and a permit was obtained from the city,” Ms. Malazhavaya says. 

Watch for shifts from previous years' tax returns: Inconsistencies in individual (or business) tax returns from one year to another may attract attention. Watch for new sources of income and large sales or purchases, says Natalie Worsfold, partner, tax litigation, with Counter Tax Litigators LLP in Toronto. 

In addition, CRA systems often flag first-time declarations of offshore assets for a pre-assessment review that may precede an audit. 

“If you respond to [that] with enough information, you can usually escape a full audit,” she says. 

Don't stray too far from the average: If the average income in the taxpayer's neighbourhood is much higher than the taxpayer's reported income, the discrepancy may be flagged, says Sabrina Fitzgerald, national tax leader with PwC Canada in Ottawa. 

Echoing Ms. Worsfold, she adds that shifts from year-over-year averages may trigger an audit as well. For example, a sudden change in reported investment income, medical expenses or spousal support payments. 

Avoid big changes in businesses: Ms. Fitzgerald says frequent changes in the structure of a business may raise suspicion. So can a significant increase in expenses or expenses that are either disproportionate to reported revenue or unusual for the industry. Making significant changes when amending a corporate tax return may also prompt an audit. 

Keep business claims reasonable: Claims for large refundable credits may cause the CRA to take a closer look. 

“The CRA may scrutinize these claims to ensure they're legitimate and accurately reported,” Ms. Fitzgerald says. 

Also, a long run of rental or business losses may raise questions about whether these ventures have a reasonable expectation of earning income or are merely a hobby.

Classify expenses appropriately: As anything outside the pattern of a business's normal reporting could raise the CRA's eyebrows, make sure there's consistency in how business expenses are classified, Ms. Worsfold says. 

It's essential, for example, to ensure bookkeepers and accountants are on the same page when deciding how to categorize a contractor's fees. 

“Strengthen your documents,” she says. “Keep an eye on what's in your journal entries [and] in your year-end adjusting entries, [which are] one of the first places CRA looks.” 

Make sure all reporting matches: Mismatches in reporting for a business and related corporations can trigger an audit. In addition, corporate tax returns should be consistent with GST/HST reporting and T slips. 

“The pattern recognition that the CRA is doing is essentially looking at all the information they have about you and people you do business with, and then looking to see where the inconsistencies are,” Ms. Worsfold says.

Increasingly, CRA audits are risk-based challenges to something that appeared on a taxpayer's return, rather than geared toward education, Ms. Worsfold adds. That means back-and-forth communication can escalate quickly from friendly to “a conflict unfolding in front of your eyes.” 

She recommends businesses, in particular, stay in touch with their accountant throughout the year and, if selected for an audit, remain involved in the process even if the accountant takes the lead. 

“The audit volume and intensity are increasing so much, you want to make sure that everybody's aware of what's happening, what's being passed to the CRA and where you are in that conflict escalation framework,” Ms. Worsfold says.

            Fresh warthog carcass in tow, a poacher speeds away from Zimbabwe's Imire Rhino and Wildlife Conservancy. Blood spatters, footprints and tire marks are the only traces of the crime he has just committed, but a trace is all it takes for the hunter to become the hunted.
    


            His arrest comes a short while later, courtesy of Shinga, a Belgian Malinois that perfectly retraced the poacher's 2.8-mile (4.5-kilometer) route home, leading an anti-poaching team to his door.
    


            Last October's pursuit ultimately began much further afield, in the sleepy Welsh town of Carmarthen, where Shinga was born and raised. It's home to the kennels of Dogs4Wildlife, a non-profit organization that trains dogs to support anti-poaching units (APUs) in their efforts to protect endangered wildlife across southern Africa.
    


            It's run by professional dog trainers Darren Priddle and Jacqui Law, who decided to blend their career experiences of developing working dogs for police, security, and military operations with their love of wildlife, after seeing photos of a poached African rhino on social media in 2015.
    


            “It was quite a horrific image. We sat down and we said, ‘Okay, that's really affected us,'” Priddle told CNN.
    


            “We can deploy dogs in the UK to track people … to look for drugs, firearms and explosives, so why could we not look at developing the dogs that we were training for conservation efforts?”
    


            The duo has since sent 15 dogs to five sub-Saharan African countries, including Mozambique and Tanzania, each one bred by them in southwest Wales.
    


            They usually breed one or two litters each year. Dutch shepherds and Belgian Malinois are two of the most common breeds for tracking, while labradors and spaniels are typically the detection (sniffer) dogs of choice.
    


            Training begins from as early as two days old. Priddle acknowledges that sounds young, but he believes early imprinting programs can provide a strong foundation for the formal training that commences around six weeks later.
    


            “There's a lot of scientific study out there that's been documented on exposing puppies to touch, different temperatures, different surfaces and textures, as well as different odors that we put into the whelping box when they're very young,” he explained
    


            “It just helps their brain and (helps) their synapses to fire. We see a lot of advancement in those puppies.”
    


            The curriculum closely follows that of the typical police or security dog, focusing on obedience, tracking, and scent detection – a skill used to sniff out rhino horn, elephant ivory and bushmeat.
    


            The only key difference to the training process is acclimating dogs to the sights, sounds and smells of lions, giraffes and the myriad other species they will help protect. With rhino and elephant numbers severely lacking in the wetlands of Carmarthenshire, trips to local zoos are organized to desensitize the puppies to African wildlife.
    


            Typically, after 16 to 18 months, dogs are ready for assignment. Even though Priddle accompanies each one on the long flight to their new home, spending the first month with the anti-poaching unit to provide field and animal welfare training to rangers, goodbyes never get easier.
    


            “The transition from spending every waking moment with that dog, having a very strong relationship, to then letting that go is challenging and difficult,” Law said.
    


            “But as much as it breaks my heart when they go, I know they're going for the greater good.”
    


            Easing the pain are WhatsApp group chats set up for Priddle and Law to keep in touch with and advise APUs across the various reserves and conservancies.
    


            They are particularly active forums, especially given that the organization also provides training and consultancy to teams with existing dog units, such as the Akashinga Rangers, Africa's first armed all-female anti-poaching squad, who watch over Zimbabwe's vast Phundundu Wildlife Area.
    


            Naturally, updates of success are a source of immense personal pride for the pair back in Wales. Shinga's tracking triumph in October followed the achievements of fellow Belgian Malinois Dan, which in 2013 alerted his team to a rhino calf that had been caught in a snare trap in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa.
    


            Such victories demonstrate the “game-changing” value such dogs can have when incorporated into conservation efforts, argue the duo, even through their mere presence.
    


            “When these reserves bring a specialist dog onto a wildlife reserve … the word spreads very quickly that the APUs now have the capability to actually catch these poachers on a more efficient and successful basis,” Priddle said.
    


            “Some of the smaller wildlife reserves almost eradicate poaching in all types completely, just because of the deterrent value that dog brings to the party.”
    


            As park manager and head of anti-poaching operations at Zimbabwe's 10,000-acre Imire conservancy, Reilly Travers has had a front row seat for the last seven years to the impact of Shinga and also Murwi, a Dutch shepherd whose training was paid for by the fundraising efforts of pupils of the local Harare International school.
    


            Capable of covering as much as 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) an hour when tracking, even in darkness, dogs allow rangers to “own the night,” Travers explained, adding an invaluable level of versatility and unpredictability to their arsenal.
    


            And on numerous occasions Shinga and Murwi have alerted units to potentially mortal threats – be it from poachers or predators – through body language alone.
    


            “They've saved our guys on the ground on several occasions and they've been responsible for apprehending quite a few poachers,” Travers told CNN.
    


            “It's had a massive impact on security for Imire. We've had a drastic reduction in poaching and the K9 unit has a massive role to play in that … It's not the silver bullet but it's a tool that will make a significant difference.”
    


            Zimbabwe once boasted thousands of rhinos, yet numbers nosedived to less than 450 by 1992 because of poaching networks, according to conservation charity Save the Rhino.



            The efforts of Imire, which saw the birth of its 23rd rhino in 2023, helped the country's rhino population climb back over the 1,000-mark in 2022, but statistics continue to make for grim reading across the wider continent.
    


            Though the numbers of African rhinos poached annually has dropped steadily since a peak of over 1,300 in 2015, almost 600 kills were still recorded last year, according to Save the Rhino. It contributed to an overall decline in the total African black rhino population in 2023, though white rhino numbers are on the rise.
    


            And the impact of each loss extends far beyond statistics, Priddle and Law explain, especially at the smaller reserves that Dogs4Wildlife focuses on, which have markedly less anti-poaching resources than the continent's most renowned parks.

            Recalling the sight of a de-horned 25-year-old bull rhino and eight-year-old male in Limpopo, both killed by a single poacher, Law stressed the knock-on effect on the wider environment.
    


            “The vegetation they clear, the seeds they disperse, all the other animals that are impacted. You think it's just a rhino that's gone – it's the whole ecosystem that suffers,” Law explained.
    


            “The owners of that reserve had a relationship with that bull for 25 years – we grieve when we lose a dog after 10 to 15 years. For us to experience the impact that losing those two rhinos had on the reserve owner sort of gave us added motivation.
    


            “It was just horrific. I never want to see that again.”
    


            As Dogs4Wildlife looks ahead to its long-term goal of one day opening a specialized training and canine school within Africa, mobilizing future generations has become a key part of its overall mission.
    


            Its Conservation club, called Siyafunda Ngemvelo – which translates to “we learn in nature” in IsiZulu – has taken more than 180 South African children into reserves as part of a wildlife education program.
    


            Law said that for local people to want to protect rhinos, they must first see the animals' value to the environment.
    


            “We have to start at the fundamental basics, which is children taking responsibility for their own wildlife,” she added.
    


            “Once they get the passion for it, they're going to become future rangers, not future poachers.”

The Power Within: The Kyiv Independent's first-ever magazine. Be among the first to get it.

The Trump administration's final proposal for ending the Russia-Ukraine war included U.S. de jure recognition of Russia's control over Crimea, along with de facto recognition of its occupation of other Ukrainian territories, Axios reported on April 23, citing sources.

The news supports earlier reporting that the recognition of Russia's occupation of Crimea and a ban on Ukraine joining NATO are being considered as part of a U.S.-backed proposal to end the war.

The U.S. reportedly presented its peace proposal last week during a meeting with Ukrainian officials in Paris. At the same time, Washington signaled that it would withdraw from the talks if the parties did not agree to conclude a peace agreement soon.

The U.S. peace plan will require significant concessions from Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky, Axios reported. In turn, the pitch outlines several "tangible gains" for Russia, the outlet's source said.

According to U.S. President Donald Trump's final peace proposal, Washington would de jure recognize the Russian control over Crimea and de facto recognize the occupation of Ukrainian territories in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.

The deal would also prevent Ukraine from joining NATO but permit EU membership, lift sanctions imposed on Russia since 2014, and include deeper energy and economic cooperation between the U.S. and Russia.

In return, the U.S. promises Ukraine "a robust security guarantee" backed by European countries and possibly non-European like-minded countries. 

Trump's proposal does not clearly outline how this peacekeeping mission would work or provide security guarantees. The document also does not mention the U.S. role in this mission.

According to the U.S. peace plan, Ukraine will get back a part of Kharkiv Oblast occupied by Russia, gain unimpeded passage of the Dnipro River, which flows along the front line in some parts of southern Ukraine, and receive compensation for the reconstruction of the country. The document does not specify how this will be financed.

The document also mentions the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is to be recognized as controlled by Ukraine but operated by the U.S. As the proposal reads, the electricity produced by the plant will be supplied to both Ukraine and Russia.

The U.S. expected Ukraine to respond to its peace plan in London on April 23, according to Axios.

Zelensky has already ruled out recognizing Crimea as Russian territory, after which U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff moved to skip the London meeting. European foreign ministers are also reportedly suspending their participation.

The Associated Press

11:55 JST, April 23, 2025

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Tuesday speech that the ongoing tariffs showdown against China is unsustainable and he expects a “de-escalation” in the trade war between the world's two largest economies.

But in a private speech in Washington for JPMorgan Chase, Bessent also cautioned that talks between the United States and China had yet to formally start. U.S. President Donald Trump placed import taxes of 145% on China, which has countered with 125% tariffs on U.S. goods. Trump has placed tariffs on several dozen countries, causing the stock market to stumble and interest rates to increase on U.S. debt as investors worry about slower economic growth and higher inflationary pressures.

Details of the speech were confirmed by two people familiar with the remarks who insisted on anonymity to discuss them.

“I do say China is going to be a slog in terms of the negotiations,” Bessent said according to a transcript obtained by The Associated Press. “Neither side thinks the status quo is sustainable.”

The S&P 500 stock index rose 2.5% after Bloomberg News initially reported Bessent's remarks.

Trump acknowledged the increase in the stock market in remarks to reporters afterward on Tuesday, but he avoided confirming if he, too, thought the situation with China was unsustainable as Bessent had said behind closed doors.

“We're doing fine with China,” Trump said.

Despite his high tariffs, Trump said he would be “very nice” to China and not play hardball with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

“We're going to live together very happily and ideally work together,” Trump said.

The U.S. president said that the final tariff rate with China would come down “substantially” from the current 145%.

“It won't be that high, not going to be that high,” Trump said.

The Trump administration has met for talks with counterparts from Japan, India, South Korea, the European Union, Canada and Mexico, among other nations. But Trump has shown no public indications that he plans to pullback his baseline 10% tariff, even as he has insisted he's looking for other nations to cut their own import taxes and remove any non-tariff barriers that the administration says have hindered exports from the U.S.

China on Monday warned other countries against making trade deals with the United States that could negatively impact China.

“China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests,” China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration has received 18 proposals from other countries for trade deals with the U.S., adding that “everyone involved wants to see a trade deal happen.”

The uncertainty over tariffs in the financial markets has also been amplified by Trump calling on the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate, with the president saying he could fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell if he wanted to do so.

Leavitt said Trump believes the Fed has by holding rates steady as it awaits the impacts of tariffs “in the name of politics, rather in the name of what's right for the American economy.”

Trump later said that he wanted Powell to “be early” in lowering rates and that he has no intention of firing the Fed chair, despite previously suggesting that he would.

The Democratic Party‘s favorability has dipped across the board since the 2024 election, and a new survey shows its standing has dramatically slipped with younger voters in recent years.

The Harvard Youth Poll from the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School, released Wednesday, shows that young people are not impressed with Democrats in Congress. Their support for congressional Democrats falls below that of congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump.

In the survey, conducted with 2,096 18-to-29-year-olds last month, just 23% approved of the job congressional Democrats are doing, compared to 29% who approve of congressional Republicans' job performance and 32% who approve of Trump's job performance.

In Harvard's 2017 and 2020 youth polls, congressional Democrats had significantly higher approval ratings than their GOP counterparts or Trump. In less than five years, their approval rating has dropped 25% among young people. Through the 2017, 2020, and 2025 polls, young people's views on Republicans in Congress and Trump have remained stable, only fluctuating a couple of percentage points.

While Trump's job performance rating, 31%, was nearly identical to 2017's 32% and slightly up from 2020's 29%, the demographic breakdown shifted. In the 2017 survey, Trump only had 6% approval from young black people, compared to 16% in the 2025 poll, while his rating with young white people dropped from 44% in 2017 to 39% in 2025.

DEMOCRATIC PARTY TROUBLES MOUNT AS MORE VOTERS TURN RIGHT, GIVE GOP EDGE

Trump and Republicans made gains with key Democratic strongholds in the 2024 election, including young voters, as he won the White House and became the first Republican since 2004 to win the popular vote. In 2020, Trump lost young voters 60% to 36%, but in 2024, he only lost the group 54% to 43%, according to CNN exit polls.

While Democrats have aimed to regain ground with these demographics, some have insisted that messaging is not the problem. In an appearance on MSNBC last week, Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC), an influential Democrat, deferred blame to the media for the party's poor polling figures.

Five years after Harvey Weinstein's original #MeToo trial delivered a searing reckoning for one of Hollywood's most powerful figures, the ex-studio boss is on trial again after an appeals court threw out his landmark rape conviction.

NEW YORK (AP) — Harvey Weinstein 's #MeToo retrial opened Wednesday, giving a new jury a fresh look at familiar rape and sexual assault allegations — plus a newly added claim from a former model.

For the first time, prosecutors publicly identified Kaja Sokola and detailed her account of what unfolded between her and the Oscar-winning movie producer in the early 2000s. He is criminally charged with forcing oral sex on her in 2006, but she also accused him in a civil lawsuit of groping her against her will four years earlier, when she was 16.

Like the two other accusers in the case, Sokola alleges a complex series of encounters and reactions — being sexually assaulted, yet staying in touch, wary of Weinstein but wanting to remain on good terms with a power broker who dangled the possibility of an acting career.

“Why did the defendant hold this level of power and control in the eyes of these three women? … It's because Harvey Weinstein defined the field,” prosecutor Shannon Lucey told jurors in an opening statement. “He knew how tempting promises of success were. He produced, he choreographed, he therefore directed, their ultimate silence for years.”

AP correspondent Julie Walker reports Harvey Weinstein's rape retrial has started with opening arguments.

Weinstein has pleaded not guilty, and defense lawyer Arthur Aidala countered by portraying the accusers as willing partners in a showbiz quid pro quo.

“The casting couch is not a crime scene,” Aidala told the majority-female jury. He compared prosecutors' allegations to the preview of a movie that “falls flat on its face.” 




The 73-year-old Weinstein, seated in the wheelchair he now uses because of health problems, didn't look at Lucey or the jury during her presentation before Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and others in a packed courtroom audience. But Weinstein watched intently as Aidala outlined his defense. 

The retrial is happening because New York's top court last year threw out Weinstein's conviction, which in 2020 was a watershed moment for the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct. The high court found that the previous trial judge allowed prejudicial testimony about allegations that were separate from the charges.

Weinstein's retrial is playing out at a different cultural moment than the first. #MeToo, which exploded in 2017 with allegations against Weinstein, has evolved and ebbed.

At the start of Weinstein's first trial, chants of “rapist” could be heard from protesters outside. This time, there was none of that. 

Nevertheless, Sokola's lawyer, Lindsay Goldbrum, has called Weinstein's retrial a “signal to other survivors that the system is catching up — and that it's worth speaking out even when the odds seem insurmountable.”

While this jury won't hear about the allegations that got the first conviction thrown out, the panel is expected to hear from Sokola. After the high court sent the case back for retrial, prosecutors added a criminal sex act charge based on her allegations. 

The Polish-born Sokola met Weinstein in 2002 after traveling alone to New York for a modeling trip at age 16, according to prosecutors. She alleges he invited her to lunch to discuss potential acting jobs but detoured to his apartment and demanded she take off her shirt if she wanted to make it in the movie business. Then, Sokola alleges, Weinstein fondled her while making her touch his genitals.

Over the next few years, Sokola stayed in contact with Weinstein, even after telling him off for allegedly groping her in a car around 2004, Lucey told jurors. She said Weinstein arranged for Sokola to be an extra and talk to the stars of the 2007 rom-com “The Nanny Diaries,” and she invited him to lunch with her visiting sister, hoping to impress the sibling. 

After the lunch, he lured Sokola to his Manhattan hotel room by saying he had scripts for her to see, ordered her to undress, held her down on a bed, and performed oral sex on her while she tearfully implored him not to do so, Lucey said.

In the weeks after, Sokola was photographed with Weinstein and a third person at an event, and his company wrote her a recommendation letter for acting school, the prosecutor said. Lucey told jurors that power imbalances often “cause victims to behave in ways that laypersons possibly might not expect.”

After other allegations emerged against Weinstein in 2017, Sokola sued. Prosecutors said she received $3.5 million in compensation. 

Aidala said Sokola and the other accusers were “trying to take advantage of Mr. Weinstein when he was at the top,” then benefited from making allegations “when he was headed toward the bottom.”

Outside court, Sokola's attorney decried Weinstein's defense as full of “victim blaming” and “rape myths.”

In addition to the charge related to Sokola, Weinstein is being retried on a criminal sex act charge for allegedly forcibly performing oral sex on then-production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006, and a third-degree rape charge for allegedly assaulting then-aspiring actor Jessica Mann in 2013.

Weinstein's 2020 acquittals on two other charges — predatory sexual assault and first-degree rape — still stand.

The Associated Press generally does not identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley, Mann and Sokola have done.

Vice President JD Vance spoke to reporters Tuesday during a visit to India after Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that he would not attend talks in London aimed at ending the war.

President Donald Trump slammed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement on Crimea, saying it was "very harmful" to peacemaking efforts.

"It's inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy's that make it so difficult to settle this war," Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. "He has nothing to boast about! The situation for Ukraine is dire — He can have peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole country."

Trump also rejected Zelenskyy's red line in the Truth Social post, saying it was "not even a point of discussion," as the territory was "lost years ago" under then-President Barack Obama.

VANCE ISSUES ULTIMATUM TO RUSSIA, UKRAINE ON PEACE NEGOTIATIONS

American officials have apparently floated the idea of recognizing Russia's control of Crimea, a territory that Russia seized in 2014, as part of a ceasefire proposal. This would also involve the freezing of current frontlines.

In 2022, Zelenskyy said that the "Russian war against Ukraine and against the entire free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea — and its liberation," Axios reported. He reiterated this stance on Tuesday, shutting down the idea that Ukraine would recognize Russian control of Crimea.

"Ukraine will not legally recognize the occupation of Crimea," Zelenskyy said at a press conference here on Tuesday, according to the Wall Street Journal. "There's nothing to talk about here. This is against our constitution."

NIKKI HALEY ON RUSSIA AND UKRAINE SAYS US SHOULD 'WANT TO BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY'

This is not the first time Trump has criticized Zelenskyy's statements about the war. During their infamous meeting in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, Trump said that Zelenskyy's "hatred" of Russian President Vladimir Putin was making it "very tough" to make a deal.

"You see the hatred he's got for Putin, it's very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hate, he's got tremendous hatred," Trump told reporters. "And I understand that, but I can tell you the other side isn't exactly in love with, you know, him either."

TRUMP INSISTS UKRAINE-RUSSIA PEACE DEAL IS CLOSE, BUT MISTRUST IN PUTIN LEAVES EXPERTS SKEPTICAL

Trump appeared to allude to the Oval Office meeting in his Truth Social post, calling Zelenskyy "the man with no cards to play." This echoed Trump's remark during the tense February meeting in which he said that Zelenskyy didn't "have the cards" to make major demands in peace talks.

While Zelenskyy has made his demands clear, it remains uncertain what might persuade Putin to agree to a ceasefire. Although Trump administration officials have stated that they have had productive conversations with Putin, they have yet to get Russia to agree to a ceasefire proposal.

Earlier on Wednesday, Vice President JD Vance suggested that the U.S. was prepared to walk away from peace talks if Ukraine and Russia did not reach a deal soon.

President Donald Trump is planning to install two 100-foot flagpoles on the White House grounds.

The president announced the plans for the flagpoles, which he said he would pay for out of his own pocket, after he emerged from the White House residence just before 11 a.m. Wednesday with a coterie of aides and Secret Service agents.

Trump said the White House would be installing “two beautiful poles” on the grounds that would be “top of the line.”

“It was something I've often said, you know, they don't have a flagpole per se,” he said of his design proposals. “So we're putting one right where you saw us, and we're putting another one on the other side, on top of the mounds. It's going to be two beautiful poles.”

Prior to his announcement, Trump went on a roughly 10-minute walk across the White House grounds, where he appeared to discuss the potential changes to the North Lawn.

TRUMP HAS ‘NO INTENTION' OF FIRING FED CHAIRMAN JEROME POWELL

Before reentering the White House, Trump did a brief question-and-answer session about his desired flagpoles and the impacts of his tariff agenda, during which he claimed that his negotiations with China and other trade partners are progressing.

“Every country wants to partake, even countries that have ripped us off for many, many years, China, as an example,” Trump said. “But it's not just China, European Union. They ripped us off for many, many years. And those days are over. Everybody wants to be a part of what we're doing. They know that they can't get away with it any longer, but they're still going to do fine, and we're going to have a country that you can be proud of.”

XX-XY Athletics founder Jennifer Sey on Washington State failing to pass proposals to protect girls' sports and a report that former President Joe Biden secretly believed that trans athletes shouldn't compete alongside women.

EXCLUSIVE: Rep. Mary Miller, R-Ill., called on President Donald Trump's administration to take action against her state. 

In a letter obtained by Fox News Digital addressed to the Departments of Education and Justice, Miller pleaded for the agencies to investigate after the Illinois High School Association (IHSA) said it would continue allowing trans athletes to compete in girls' sports. 

"I am writing to express my deep concern regarding a recent decision by the Illinois High School Association (IHSA), which has chosen to blatantly disregard federal law and reject basic biological reality by allowing biological males to compete in girls' athletic programs. This misguided policy not only undermines the integrity and fairness of girls' sports, but it also jeopardizes the safety of young women across our state," Miller wrote. 

"I respectfully urge the Department of Justice and the Department of Education to investigate the actions of IHSA and the State of Illinois and take appropriate measures to ensure that federal civil rights protections are upheld." 

TEEN GIRLS OPEN UP ON TRANS ATHLETE SCANDAL THAT TURNED THEIR HIGH SCHOOL INTO A CULTURE WAR BATTLEGROUND 

Miller provided a statement to Fox News Digital addressing the letter, and condemning Gov. J.B. Pritzker. 

"I'm calling on Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary Linda McMahon to launch an immediate investigation into the IHSA and the State of Illinois. Gov. J.B. Pritzker and radical Illinois Democrats must be held accountable for enforcing abusive, anti-science gender policies ahead of the safety of our daughters and the fairness of girls' sports," Miller said. 

Transgender athletes have been permitted to compete in girls' sports in Illinois since 2011.

Illinois became one of the many blue states to openly defy Trump's "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" executive order after it was signed on Feb. 5. 

In a public letter to state GOP lawmakers last week, the IHSA said Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and the Illinois Department of Human Rights have declared that state law requires that transgender athletes be allowed to participate based on gender identity. The IHSA cited the state's human rights laws as a barrier to banning biological males from girls' sports. 

That letter came in response to GOP lawmakers sending their own letter to the IHSA in March asking what the body would do to change policy after Trump's executive order passed.

"The Illinois High School Association has crossed a dangerous line. By blatantly violating federal law and rejecting biological reality, they are not only undermining fairness in girls' sports – they're putting the safety of young women at risk," Miller told Fox News Digital. 

A federal Title IX investigation is already underway in Illinois after a Deerfield mother alleged her daughter was forced to change in front of a trans student. Deerfield Public Schools District 109 is facing a probe by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights after Illinois mother Nicole Georgas brought light to the situation. 

Georgas has now told Fox News Digital she is also worried about her daughter's athletic future because of the IHSA's ruling. 

"Imagine your daughter, dedicating her life, training for years, hours and hours a week, for her championship state race, only to face a male beating her and winning that coveted scholarship. How is that at all fair? Our daughter's dedication to athletics is slowly being erased," Georgas said. 

Deerfield Public Schools District 109 responded to the investigation in a statement to Fox News Digital and, like the IHSA, cited the Illinois Human Rights Act for its protocols. 

"Deerfield Public Schools District 109 complies with state law. The Illinois Human Rights Act prohibits all public school districts from discriminating on the basis of sex, including gender identity, and mandates that students must be permitted access to the locker room and bathroom that aligns with their gender identity," the statement said.

Meanwhile, Maine has already seen the type of intervention that Miller is calling for.

That state has seen its federal funding cut by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Justice has launched a lawsuit against it for continued defiance of Trump's order. Maine has launched its own lawsuit against the Trump administration over the funding freeze, and a federal judge has ruled it be unfrozen. 

A New York Times/Ipsos survey found the vast majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, don't think transgender athletes should be permitted to compete in women's sports. 

Of the 2,128 people who participated, 79% said biological males who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports. Of the 1,025 people who identified as Democrats or leaning Democratic, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete with women.

Five years after Harvey Weinstein's original #MeToo trial delivered a searing reckoning for one of Hollywood's most powerful figures, the ex-studio boss is on trial again after an appeals court threw out his landmark rape conviction.

NEW YORK (AP) — Opening statements in Harvey Weinstein 's #MeToo rape retrial began Wednesday with a prosecutor telling jurors about the three allegations at issue in the case, including one involving a woman who wasn't part of the original trial in 2020. Weinstein's lawyer countered that the women and the one-time Hollywood powerbroker had consensual relationships.

Kaja Sokola, a former model from Poland, alleges that Weinstein pinned her to a bed and forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006 after luring her to his Manhattan hotel room with the promise of movie scripts. Four years earlier, Sokola alleges, he molested her at his apartment when she was just 16, Assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey told jurors.

Weinstein, 73, is charged in connection with the 2006 allegation, but not the earlier one. Sokola previously sued and received $3.5 million in compensation, Lucey said.

It's the first time Manhattan prosecutors have detailed Sokola's allegations, which were added to the case after New York's highest court overturned Weinstein's conviction last year. The rest of the retrial involves allegations from two women who were part of the original trial — Miriam Haley and Jessica Mann.

The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley, Mann and Sokola have done.

Emphasizing Weinstein's onetime influence in the movie industry, Lucey said the ex-studio boss used “dream opportunities as weapons” to prey on women. He is charged with raping Mann and forcing oral sex on Haley and Sokola. 




“The defendant wanted their bodies, and the more they resisted, the more forceful he got,” Lucey said.

Weinstein, she said, “held the golden ticket: a chance to make it, or not.”

The Oscar-winning producer, seated in the wheelchair he now uses because of health problems, whispered with one of his lawyers and appeared to take notes as Lucey described his alleged crimes, but he didn't look at the jury. 

Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone.

His lawyer, Arthur Aidala, told jurors in his opening statement that Weinstein engaged in “mutually beneficial relationships” with women who wanted his help in the industry but that nothing he did was illegal.

“In this case, the casting couch is not a crime scene,” Aidala argued.

He implored jurors to view the case with an open mind and to wait until they've heard all of the evidence before reaching a conclusion. Acknowledging Weinstein's former career, Aidala compared the opening stage of the trial to a movie trailer.

“How often is a preview great, but the movie falls flat on its face?” the defense lawyer said. “After you hear all of the evidence, their case is going to fall flat on its face.”

The audience in the packed courtroom included Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. He inherited the landmark #MeToo case, brought by his predecessor, when the Court of Appeals last year threw out the 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence because the judge allowed testimony about allegations Weinstein was not charged with. The reversal led to the retrial. 

Weinstein's retrial is playing out at a different cultural moment than the first. #MeToo, which exploded in 2017 with allegations against Weinstein, has evolved and ebbed.

The jury counts seven women and five men — unlike the seven-man, five-woman panel that convicted him in 2020 — and there's a different judge.

At the start of Weinstein's first trial, chants of “rapist” could be heard from protesters outside. This time, there was none of that. 

Weinstein is being retried on a criminal sex act charge for allegedly forcibly performing oral sex on Haley, a movie and TV production assistant at the time, in 2006, and a third-degree rape charge for allegedly assaulting Mann, a then-aspiring actor, in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.

Weinstein also faces a criminal sex act charge for allegedly forcing oral sex on Sokola, also in 2006. Prosecutors said she came forward days before his first trial but wasn't part of that case. They said they revisited her allegations when his conviction was thrown out.

Weinstein's acquittals on the two most serious charges at his 2020 trial — predatory sexual assault and first-degree rape — still stand.

Sokola's lawyer, Lindsay Goldbrum, said Weinstein's retrial marks a “pivotal moment in the fight for accountability in sex abuse cases” and a “signal to other survivors that the system is catching up — and that it's worth speaking out even when the odds seem insurmountable.”

During jury selection, a prosecutor asked prospective jurors whether they'd heard of the #MeToo movement. Most said they had, but that it wouldn't affect them either way. 

Those who indicated it might were excused.

Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) will not run for a sixth term in the Senate, clearing the way for a younger crop of Democrats to compete for his seat.

Durbin, 80, announced Wednesday that he will retire from the Senate in 2026. The decision had been expected, with the senator raising a paltry $43,000 in the first quarter. But his announcement means Democrats who were previously mounting a shadow primary can now run openly for one of Illinois's two Senate seats.

It also opens the door to a rare leadership shake-up in the Senate, in which Durbin is the longest-serving party whip after two decades in the role.

“The decision of whether to run for re-election has not been easy. I truly love the job of being a United States Senator. But in my heart, I know it's time to pass the torch,” Durbin said in a statement on X. “So, I am announcing today that I will not be seeking re-election at the end of my term.”

The seat is rated safe for Democrats by nonpartisan election forecasters. More significantly, Durbin's retirement will reshuffle the chamber's leadership roster, where Durbin and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) have led as the top two Democrats since President Donald Trump first came to power in 2017.

Durbin also serves as the lead Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, creating another opportunity for a colleague to rise up the ranks. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) is the next most senior Democrat on the panel.

A wave of Illinois Democrats could mount a bid to replace him as they seek to capitalize on what could be a once-in-a-generation open primary. Those names include state Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton and Reps. Lauren Underwood (D-IL), Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), and Robin Kelly (D-IL).

It's unclear whether Durbin would get involved in what could become a messy primary. His retirement announcement suggested he may remain neutral. 

“We're also fortunate to have a strong Democratic bench ready to serve,” Durbin said. “We need them now more than ever.”

Durbin's anemic first-quarter fundraising in the lead-up to his decision stood in stark contrast to the war chests already at the disposal of would-be contenders to fill the seat.

Krishnamoorthi raised $3 million in the first three months of the year, giving him $19 million cash on hand that could be used for a Senate run. Stratton has signaled that, should she enter the race, she would receive financial backing from billionaire Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL) of the Hyatt hotel empire.

ILLINOIS DEMOCRATS WAIT IN THE WINGS FOR DURBIN 2026 ANNOUNCEMENT

Durbin has served in Congress for more than 40 years, since 1983, when he began as a congressman, until his election to the Senate in 1996. He made no explicit mention of Trump or Republicans in his retirement message but made clear the stakes he believes are at play in American politics.

“The threats to our democracy and way of life are very real,” he said. “And I can assure you, I'll do everything in my power to fight for Illinois and the future of our country every day of my remaining time in the Senate.”

Michel Picaud, president of Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris, shares updates on the restoration of the Notre Dame Cathedral in France five years after a fire shut the site down.

Many travelers to Istanbul, Turkey, may find themselves at one of the most beautiful sacred places in the world: the Hagia Sophia.

The ancient temple attracts scores of visitors from the West. It's known for its history as a Christian basilica for almost 1,000 years before becoming a mosque during the Ottoman Empire.

Officials are now working to preserve the historic domes of the monument — built between 532 and 537 AD — from the threat of earthquakes.

POPULAR CHURCH WILL CURB TOURIST CROWDS BY CREATING SEPARATE 'SELFIE SPACE'

The renovation will reinforce the Hagia Sophia's main dome and half domes, replacing the worn lead coverings and upgrading the steel framework, The Associated Press (AP) reported.

In 1935, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founder of the modern Republic of Turkey, transformed Hagia Sophia into a museum.

Mehmet Selim Okten, construction engineer and member of the scientific council overseeing the renovations, told AP a "new phase" of construction is about to begin.

"At the end of these three years, we have focused on the seismic safety of Hagia Sophia, the minarets, the main dome and the main arches, especially due to the expected Istanbul earthquake," said Okten.

The renovation comes after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Turkey in 2023, destroying hundreds of buildings.

Orkten said construction workers will be able to renovate more safely and "examine the building's layers academically, including damage it suffered from fires and earthquakes in the 10th and 14th centuries," according to AP.

"A tower crane will be installed on the eastern facade, and then we will cover the top of this unique structure with a protective frame system," he said. 

The Hagia Sophia receives an average of around 50,000 visitors daily and approximately 6-7 million annually, according to Istanbul Deputy Akturkoglu.

Montgomery County Mom Grace Morrison joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss her ongoing legal battle over the lack of opt-out for LGBTQ+ curriculum in schools. 

The University of Louisville has reportedly agreed to pay nearly $1.6 million to settle a lawsuit brought by a former professor who was fired for criticizing transgender treatments for children experiencing gender dysphoria.

Dr. Allan Josephson worked for nearly 15 years as chief of the University of Louisville's Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychology. According to his legal complaint, Josephson was able to turn around the struggling division during his tenure and received perfect scores in his 2014-2016 annual reviews.

Despite his professional accomplishments, the complaint alleges that Josephson was demoted in 2017 and eventually fired after making comments in his own capacity challenging the push to use hormone therapy and surgery for children with gender dysphoria, according to legal group Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF).

ADF, which represented Josephson in court, announced the settlement agreement Monday and hailed the case as a "major victory" for free speech.

"I'm glad to finally receive vindication for voicing what I know is true," Josephson also said in a statement. "Children deserve better than life-altering procedures that mutilate their bodies and destroy their ability to lead fulfilling lives. In spite of the circumstances I suffered through with my university, I'm overwhelmed to see that my case helped lead the way for other medical practitioners to see the universal truth that altering biological sex is impossibly dangerous while acceptance of one's sex leads to flourishing."

According to the complaint, the saga began in October 2017 when Josephson participated in a panel discussion on transgender ideology hosted by the conservative organization, The Heritage Foundation, in which he spoke out against gender ideology activism influencing the medical treatment of children experiencing gender dysphoria. 

Upon learning of Josephson's remarks, officials at the university's LGBT center reportedly pressured his division to take disciplinary action against him.

Scrutiny of his views intensified after he appeared as an expert witness in a legal case involving a school district's bathroom policy around gender identity.

A few of Josephson's colleagues who objected to his remarks pushed for the administration to take disciplinary action against him, the complaint says. The next month, Josephson was informed by the university that he was being demoted from chief of the division to a junior faculty member.

According to the complaint, university officials continued to "belittle and berate him," inflicting "irreparable damage to his professional career and reputation," and reduced his salary and benefits, before he was told in February 2019 that his contract would not be renewed, effectively firing him.

Josephson challenged his firing in a lawsuit against the university filed the following month. He alleged the school "retaliated" against him for expressing his views, in violation of his First Amendment rights and right to due process and equal protection under the law.

With the six-year legal battle resulting in a favorable settlement, Alliance Defending Freedom filed a stipulated dismissal of the case Monday, court records show.

"Hopefully, other public universities will learn from this that if they violate the First Amendment, they can be held accountable, and it can be very expensive," ADF Senior Counsel Travis Barham said.

            By conventional measures, Donald Trump's second presidency is already descending into disarray amid a legal morass, self-inflicted errors, and a vast gap between its massive ambition and its capacity to enact that vision.
    


            Yet Trump's tens of millions of supporters didn't send a conventional president back to the White House – and don't judge their hero's performance by traditional yardsticks.
    


            On one hand, exhausting crises on multiple fronts point to a potentially failed administration. But as Trump attempts to destroy governing structures at home and abroad, chaos is itself a marker of success.
    


            So the question, as Trump transitions from the shock-and-awe euphoria start of his second term to grinding out his priorities, becomes what kind of event could cause these two competing realities to collide.
    


            A recession that the president seems determined to talk the country into might puncture the bubble of achievement that the White House aggressively cultivates each day. High prices and job losses, after all, don't discriminate between Republican and Democratic voters.
    


            Or perhaps it would take a national security crisis precipitated by his volatile leadership and callow foreign policy team to destroy Trump's presidency. Even then, Trump's hold on his supporters is so strong, nothing might shake their confidence even if he alienates the middle-ground voters who helped reelect him. This, after all, is a president who convinced millions that the fair election he lost in 2020 was a stitch-up.

            Still, if Trump somehow manages to secure a better deal for US manufacturers with his tariff wars, he might justify the mayhem he's visited on financial markets. If “America first” really does convince Europe to defend itself and the president's vows to forge peace work, the world may end up safer.
    


            But hubris is threatening an administration that has made overreaches by previous presidents seem tame by comparison.
    


            “You were overwhelmingly elected by the biggest majority … Americans want you to be president,” Attorney General Pam Bondi gushed to Trump last week during a Cabinet meeting, suggesting the Trump team has misread its supposed mandate.
    


            Trump's victory, while clear, was not a landslide. Together with a tiny GOP majority in the House, it's a thin political platform on which to base an attempt to simultaneously remake the global geopolitical system and the world trading paradigm; to transform the US government; and to destroy elite establishment centers of power.
    


            Weeks ago, the Washington narrative was that Trump's second-term team would be more disciplined and unified than his first. But that's looking increasingly threadbare. The president badly needs some swift wins – not just those that reward his MAGA base – to sustain his credibility.
    


A sense of disorder is mounting.



            — Backbiting and organizational chaos at the Pentagon came after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed fears about his fitness for the job by posting details of military strikes in Yemen on two Signal chats.
    


            — Trump's trade wars have wiped trillions off global stock markets and are likely soon to hike prices for inflation-weary US shoppers. His threats against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have shattered investor confidence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is heading to its worst April since the Great Depression. And amazingly, the world is wondering whether the dollar is a haven anymore. All of this may be behind an apparent and emerging climbdown that the administration signaled on Tuesday on the China tariffs and Trump's warnings that he might fire the central bank chief.
    


            — His purge of first-term officials who knew how Washington worked is resulting in embarrassing accidents.  An undocumented migrant from Maryland was deported by mistake to El Salvador, igniting a massive legal showdown. And the administration set off a feud with Harvard University, apparently by mistake.
    


            — Trump's claims that the force of his personality alone would end wars made him look foolish. His Ukraine peace effort looks amateur. Carnage is still raging in Gaza. He's destroyed America's closest diplomatic friendship, with Canada, with unhinged demands it become the 51st state. His bullying means many tourists are staying away, frightened by potential harassment at US borders. Allies are making alternative arrangements, thereby diminishing American power.
    


            — There has been no blizzard of lawmaking to bolster Trump's claims he's had the most successful first 100 days in generations. How Republicans will pass his huge tax plan is unclear. And a future Democratic president could wipe out his multitudes of executive orders with a stroke of their own pen.
    


            — Tax season at the Internal Revenue Service was marked by dysfunction, with a revolving door of acting commissioners at the key agency.
    


            — Elon Musk's evisceration of the US government may be setting up a series of disasters that are not yet evident. Massive funding cuts may gut US emergency preparedness as hurricane season approaches. Canceled health research on diseases like cancer may cause unnecessary deaths in years to come. The mistaken firing and hurried rehiring of technicians who look after nuclear weapons seems like an emblem of the Tesla chief's tenure in Washington, which he said on Tuesday he'd soon begin to scale back.
    


            — And Trump's incessant demands for more power have pushed the United States to the brink of one of the worst constitutional crises in 250 years. The forest of legal challenges has also severely disrupted many of the administration's top priorities, including its signature mass deportation program.
    


            The White House, however, insists that such damning assessments do not recognize what it regards as a spectacular record of success.
    


            And while Trump world's creation of alternative facts has reached stunning new heights in his second term, there is some logic to their arguments.
    


            The president has never made much pretense of governing for the entire country. His presidencies have been a long succession of attempts to gratify his political base.
    


            That lens is the best way to understand his second term.
    


            Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is the culmination of decades of conservative hopes to dismantle the mighty federal machine. This is not just an ideological goal, although hostility to government is one of the few common themes of two great GOP codes, Reaganism and Trumpism. Many Republican officials believe that the civil service has always been a liberal check on their presidents' power. And if attempts to shatter that stranglehold don't ultimately result in the full dismantling of what Trump first-term political guru Steve Bannon calls the administrative state, then paralyzing government might work almost as well. It's going to be all but impossible for a future Democratic president to quickly rebuild what Musk has destroyed.
    


            Trump's belief in almost absolute presidential power horrifies his critics. But millions of Americans voted for this. He made no secret on the campaign trail of his intention to weaponize presidential power and the Justice Department to pursue his enemies. “It's good to have a strong man at the head of a country,” Trump reflected during a campaign appearance in early 2024, in remarks that explain his domestic and foreign policies.
    


            One of the most controversial aspects of that vision is playing out in the deportations of undocumented migrants to a notorious prison in El Salvador, including that of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.
    


            But the White House loves the fight. It's failed to prove Abrego Garcia is a terrorist and a gang member. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stoked the fire again on Tuesday. “We were always right. The president was always on the right side of this issue to deport this illegal criminal from our community.” When Trump said last week that he'd like to deport US citizen criminals to El Salvador, he knew his audience. And on this immigration issue, he has some genuine results to show for his efforts. Border crossings are down significantly compared with the days of the Biden administration.
    


            Trump's tariff wars seem insane to Wall Street investors and middle-class Americans who've seen their 401(k) plans plummet. But the Trump administration is betting on a different audience – working Americans in rural areas and states devastated by globalization who helped elect him twice. “We shipped countless jobs overseas and, with them, our capacity to make things – from furniture, appliances, and even weapons of war,” Vice President JD Vance said in India on Tuesday. He added: “Many were proud of where they came from: their way of life, the kind of jobs they worked, and the kind of jobs their parents worked before them.”
    


            Trump's America first creed horrifies the foreign policy establishment and threatens to undo generations of US leadership. But those are the same experts who ran the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and are reviled by Trump's base. America's reputation abroad is being slammed by Trump's dismantling of USAID, genuflection to Russian President Vladimir Putin and abandonment of Africa. But Trump and his supporters care little for allies. He'd rather be feared than liked.
    


            A veteran of those early 21st-century wars, Hegseth now runs the Pentagon. His defenestration of senior uniformed officers who advocated diversity might be unfairly wrecking military careers and rocking the leadership of the world's most lethal military. But the former Fox News anchor has the support of conservative media – one reason Trump is standing by him despite reports of his cavalier attitude to classified information. Leavitt hinted at the strategy behind Hegseth's selection and retention on Tuesday, saying, “There's a lot of people in this city who reject monumental change, and I think, frankly, that's why we've seen a smear campaign against the secretary of defense since the moment that President Trump announced his nomination before the United States Senate.”
    


            A similar distaste for the establishment also explains Trump's showdown with Harvard. It might have been mistakenly started, but the clash is exactly the kind of issue the White House seeks – placing Trump on the side of the overwhelming majority of Americans who didn't attend Ivy League colleges. If Democrats chose to defend these bastions of elitism, so much the better for Trump's political cause.
    


            History will form its own judgments on the second term of Trump. But as the daily pandemonium unfolds, it's worth remembering that this divisive presidency can look like a dangerous failure to half the country while manifesting as a stunning success to the other half.
    


            If America was ever united by a common version of reality, that's no longer the case.

Follow:


            A defiant Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth booked himself on the television network where he used to work as a host Tuesday morning in a bid to address the fallout over revelations that he discussed military plans in a second Signal group chat, this time with his wife and brother.
    


            But after Hegseth faced multiple direct questions in the Fox News interview about his inner circle being in disarray, the appearance was seen by some officials as only calling more attention to the story rather than tamping down the coverage, according to two people familiar with how the interview was perceived within the administration.
    


            Yet President Donald Trump is unlikely to dismiss Hegseth and has spoken to him twice since The New York Times and CNN reported on the second Signal group on Sunday night. In their first call, Trump said he had Hegseth's back and voiced frustration at “leakers” he said were trying to damage his administration, according to a person familiar with the conversation.
    


            Trump has since been soliciting feedback from people around him about Hegseth's performance during conversations, according to two people familiar with the comments. So far, most, if not all, has been positive about the Pentagon chief. Trump is extremely hesitant to fire any Cabinet official at this point in his term, much less Hegseth, given how hard his team fought to get him confirmed in the first place.
    


            Yet the state of affairs in his inner circle has troubled some senior officials who want to see changes made to how the secretary's team in the front office of the Pentagon operates. The chaos prevailing at the Pentagon has not been lost on the White House, where officials have watched with concern as Hegseth struggles to contain the dysfunction and as his inner circle implodes.
    


            Hegseth's most trusted advisers are now his wife, his lawyer and his junior military aide, who may soon be appointed his new chief of staff, multiple people familiar with the matter said.
    


            Others close to Hegseth, including his adviser, retired Army Sgt. Maj. Eric Geressy — who served with Hegseth in Iraq and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross last month — have gotten so frustrated by the turmoil that they have indicated to colleagues that they may resign, two of the sources said. CNN has reached out to Geressy.
    


            Some of Hegseth's closest former advisers have issued warnings this week about turmoil inside the Pentagon. They include his former spokesman John Ullyot and three former senior officials Hegseth fired last week: top adviser Dan Caldwell; deputy chief of staff Darin Selnick; and Colin Carroll, who was chief of staff to the deputy secretary of defense.
    


            “It's been a month of total chaos at the Pentagon. From leaks of sensitive operational plans to mass firings, the dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president — who deserves better from his senior leadership,” Ullyot said in a statement obtained by CNN.
    


            One congressional Republican, Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, escalated his public calls Tuesday for Hegseth to be held accountable.
    


            Asked Tuesday by CNN's Jake Tapper on “The Lead” what he would do if he were president and his defense secretary had acted as Hegseth did, Bacon said, “I would hold them accountable, and I'd fire them.” Putting sensitive information on an application like Signal, Bacon said, was “very foolish,” but Hegseth's response — describing the chat earlier Tuesday on Fox as “informal, unclassified coordinations for media coordination and other things” — exacerbated the offense.
    


            “He could recover from that with candor. But when you deny it's a problem, I think it even makes it worse,” Bacon said.
    


            Carroll's firing has also strained Hegseth's relationship with Deputy Secretary of Defense Steve Feinberg, who brought Carroll on as his chief of staff and was not consulted before he was placed on leave, the sources said.
    


            “He is in full paranoia, back-against-the-wall mode,” said one of the sources familiar with Hegseth's state of mind over the last month.
    


            Hegseth's now-former chief of staff, Joe Kasper, had repeatedly clashed in recent months with the three men Hegseth dismissed last week, the sources told CNN.
    


            Several West Wing staffers had grown frustrated about what they described to others as Kasper's lack of responsiveness, often complaining about the difficulty in getting Hegseth's chief of staff on the phone or to respond to their requests. At one point toward the beginning of Hegseth's tenure, the White House was trying to reach Kasper to get Hegseth to sign a memo kickstarting the process of developing Trump's Golden Dome missile shield, but the memo went unsigned for three weeks, according to a person familiar with the matter.
    


            In another example of the disorderly nature of the front office, at one point in March, Hegseth directly asked the director of DoD's special access programs – which are among the most highly classified programs within the DoD – to read Elon Musk into more than two dozen programs having to do with China, according to multiple people familiar with the episode. But Hegseth did not first run the idea through a policy process that included lawyers, the people said, and ultimately, DoD ethics lawyers in the Standards of Conduct office said it would not be appropriate. The idea died. The people familiar with the matter said it might have succeeded if a more standard policy process had been followed.
    


            Caldwell and Selnick, who have known Hegseth for years and worked with him at the conservative veterans organization Concerned Veterans for America, came to believe Kasper was isolating Hegseth and turning him against them, the sources said. Kasper, in turn, has told people he doesn't know where those accusations are coming from — it was Hegseth who launched the leak investigation that led to their firings, according to Kasper.
    


            Kasper said he had “nothing to do” with any of the decisions made when it came to the leak investigation. “I'm not even read in, nor was I involved in decisions,” he said.
    


            Kasper is no longer Hegseth's chief of staff, and is in the process of moving into a new position as a special government employee, according to the person familiar.
    


            “Joe's a great guy. He's a great American,” Hegseth said Tuesday during the interview on Fox News, adding, “He's staying with us, going to be in a slightly different role, but he's not going anywhere, certainly not fired.”
    


            Most senior officials inside the White House believe Hegseth has been the victim of what he termed “disgruntled former employees” who were fired in the past week for what Hegseth said were unauthorized leaks to the media.
    


            The former employees in question had been handpicked by Hegseth to serve on his leadership team, but he suggested in the Fox interview that his loyalty to them had run out.
    


            “It's not my job to protect them. It's my job to protect national security, the president of the United States, and let the investigation go where it is,” he said.
    


            “Disgruntled former employees are peddling things to try to save their a**,” Hegseth told Fox.
    


            Caldwell this week denied leaking information, and said he hadn't been questioned or polygraphed as part of any investigation.
    


            “I have been a friend and supporter of Pete Hegseth for a long time, and I'm just personally devastated by this. It's just awful,” he told Tucker Carlson on his podcast. “The entire Department of Defense cannot continue to be consumed by chaos.”
    


            In his own interview on Fox, Hegseth listed a number of recent stories he suggested came about due to leaks from his staff, including plans for a US takeover of the Panama Canal and a scheduled briefing for Musk on war plans against China.
    


            Hegseth suggested he wanted to keep those issues out of the media. But one of them — the report about plans to brief Musk — came as a surprise to Trump himself, who ordered the briefing for Musk be canceled. It's not clear whether the president would have learned of the planned briefing had it not appeared in the news.
    


            While Trump's aides think the Signal matter has been sufficiently resolved, some have said they still believe there could be more to emerge about Hegseth's leadership of the Defense Department that would prove embarrassing or worse.

As he does one day each month, the Rev. Robert Turner hit the road from his home in Baltimore last week and traveled — on foot — 43 miles (69 kilometers) to Washington.

He arrived by evening on April 16 outside the White House, carrying a sign that called for for “Reparations Now.”

This time, Turner added another stop on his long day's journey — the National Museum of African American History and Culture.

Turner knelt in prayer and laid a wreath at the entrance of the museum in support of its mission, which incurred President Donald Trump's criticism alongside other Smithsonian Institution sites. In a March 27 executive order, Trump alleged that Smithsonian exhibits had disparaged the nation's history via a “divisive, race-centered ideology.”

Turner wanted to show support for the museum, which opened in 2016 and received its 10 millionth visitor in 2023. The museum tells the history of chattel slavery, Jim Crow segregation and its lingering effects, but it also highlights the determination, successes and contributions of Black Americans and Black institutions.

“I laid my wreath down there to show solidarity with the museum and the history that they present every day,” said Turner, pastor of Empowerment Temple African Methodist Episcopal Church in Baltimore. 

He said his church has committed to becoming a museum member, and he's encouraged church members to do the same. Membership costs start at $25 per year, according to an online form on the museum site.

His church is not alone, as other predominantly Black congregations are taking similar steps.

Turner said he got the idea from the Rev. Otis Moss III of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, whose church also joined the museum and who urged members to do the same. “For only $25 a year, you can protect Black history,” Moss told his church.

Two other Black pastors told The Associated Press they also supported the effort.

One was the Rev. Jacqui J. Lewis, senior minister at Middle Church in New York City — home to a multiracial congregation affiliated with the United Church of Christ.

“We belonged to the museum since its opening, and we just made another donation to them in light of this administration's policies,” she told the AP. The gift, she said, was a $1,000 “Easter Love donation.”

Bishop Timothy Clarke of the First Church of God in Columbus, Ohio, said he would be emulating Moss in making an appeal to his predominantly African American congregation.

“Our grandson is in DC on a field trip,” Clarke said in an email. “The highlight of his trip has been the visit to the Museum.”

Trump's order didn't specifically talk about budget cuts, though it tasked Vice President JD Vance, a member of the Smithsonian Board of Regents by virtue of his office, to lead the effort to purge “improper ideology” from such institutions. He pledged to “restore the Smithsonian Institution to its rightful place as a symbol of inspiration and American greatness.” Critics say he's trying to force a distorted national narrative that glosses over slavery and other historical wrongs.

Turner said he has been making his walk to Washington one day for each of the past 31 months. He's calling for the U.S. to make reparations for the legacy of slavery, Jim Crow segregation and other systemic suffering inflicted on Black people, ranging from housing and medical discrimination to mass incarceration. When he was previously a pastor in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he similarly demonstrated for reparations for the 1921 race massacre.

Turner said when he arrived last week outside the White House, a crowd of visitors was milling about, and one child who noticed his sign asked a parent, “What is reparations?”

“That to me is a perfect manifestation about why we need to be teaching more true history of America, and not taking away certain subjects because they make people feel uncomfortable,” Turner said.

Moss, in a social media post, held out hope that the museum could continue its current course, noting that Vance is just one member of the board. 

Trinity has long been socially active with a wide array of community outreaches, and Moss describes it as “a church that is unashamedly Black and unapologetically Christian.”

Former President Barack Obama had been a member of Trinity but resigned during the 2008 campaign, citing the “divisive” statements of its previous pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, while affirming the Black Church tradition of speaking out against injustice.

The African American museum, one of 21 Smithsonian museums, has also seen a recent shake-up in leadership. Shanita Beckett, who was previously the head of operations at the museum, has been widely reported to be serving as interim director.

Kevin Young, a poet and scholar of African American history, left his role as museum director in early April, following a leave of absence, according to a notice to staff. The museum did not return the AP's requests for comment this week.

On Friday, Democrats on the House Administration Committee, which has oversight over the Smithsonian Institution, expressed concern over the executive order in a letter addressed to Vance.

“This flagrant attempt to erase Black history is unacceptable and must be stopped,” said the letter signed by Reps. Joseph Morelle of New York, Terri Sewell of Alabama and Norma Torres of California. 

“The attempt to paper over elements of American history is both cowardly and unpatriotic,” the letter said.

XX-XY Athletics founder Jennifer Sey on Washington State failing to pass proposals to protect girls' sports and a report that former President Joe Biden secretly believed that trans athletes shouldn't compete alongside women.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison announced a lawsuit against the Trump administration and Department of Justice on Tuesday to ensure that states can continue letting biologically male trans athletes play in girls' sports. 

The White House has responded to the lawsuit, condemning Ellison for taking legal action to enable trans inclusion. 

"Why would a grown man sue the Trump administration to allow other biological males to participate in women's sports? This is creepy and anti-woman," White House spokesperson Harrison Fields told Fox News Digital. 

Ellison made the announcement at a press conference after months of the state defying Trump's "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" executive order. Ellison claimed he had received notice from the Department of Justice threatening legal action if the state did not follow the executive order. 

"I'm not going to sit around waiting for the Trump administration to sue Minnesota. Today, Minnesota is suing him and his administration because we will not participate in this shameful bullying," Ellison said. "We will not let a small group of vulnerable children who are only trying be healthy and live their lives be demonized."

Ellison's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis, argues that the Trump administration does not have the authority to set states' athletic gender eligibility policies through an executive order.

Minnesota is the first state to sue the Department of Justice over threats to cut funding for letting trans athletes play in girls' sports, and the second state to sue the Trump administration over the issue. 

Maine has filed a lawsuit against Trump after the Department of Agriculture cut funding to the state on April 2, and a federal judge has already ruled the USDA must unfreeze the funding. 

The Justice Department filed a lawsuit against the state for its ongoing defiance of Trump's "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" executive order. Maine has faced federal pressure in the last two months over its refusal to comply, including two federal investigations, a funding freeze and now a lawsuit. 

When Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the lawsuit against Maine at a press conference last week, she said Minnesota and California could be next. 

"We're looking at Minnesota. We're looking at California. We're looking at many, many states but they are the top two that should be on notice because we've been communicating with them," Bondi said.

After Trump's executive order, the Minnesota State High School League announced it would defy federal law by allowing transgender athletes to continue playing in women's sports.

Ellison's office stated that "based on the plain language of the statute, educational institutions and the Minnesota State High School League would violate the MHRA by prohibiting transgender athletes from participating in extracurricular activities consistent with their gender identity."

HOW TRANSGENDERISM IN SPORTS SHIFTED THE 2024 ELECTION AND IGNITED A NATIONAL COUNTERCULTURE

Minnesota's state legislature failed to pass the "Preserving Girls' Sports Act" in early March, which would have stated that "only female students may participate in an elementary or secondary school level athletic team or sport that an educational institution has restricted to women and girls."

The bill fell short in the state's House of Representatives, with 67 of the 68 votes needed to pass. Gov. Tim Walz was expected to veto the bill had it gone to his desk.

Former Minnesota Vikings and University of Minnesota football player Jack Brewer lobbied for the bill, and had told Fox News Digital he found Walz's pro-trans stances "disgusting," especially considering Walz was a football coach at Mankato West High School in the 1990s. 

"It's absolutely disgusting, and it's why, when you see him and you see his mannerisms and the way he carries himself, you know this guy doesn't appeal to real men and boys who have battled it out on the gridiron, man. I have nothing in common with this guy," Brewer said. 

"I think he's a disgrace to the football world to be honest."

A New York Times/Ipsos survey found the vast majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, don't think transgender athletes should be permitted to compete in women's sports. 

Of the 2,128 people who participated, 79% said biological males who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports. Of the 1,025 people who identified as Democrats or leaning Democratic, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete with women.

Innovation is a resource we can mine.

by  Umair Irfan

Twenty years ago, few people would have been able to imagine the energy landscape of today. In 2005, US oil production, after a long decline, had fallen to its lowest levels in decades, and few experts thought that would change. 

The US invasion of Iraq had sent gasoline prices skyward. Solar and wind power provided a tiny fraction of overall electricity, showing moderate growth every year. With domestic natural gas running short, coastal states were preparing to build import terminals to bring gas from abroad. Americans were beginning to rethink their love of giant cars as the 7,000-pound Ford Excursion SUV entered its final year of production. In short, the US was preparing for a world with a rising demand for ever scarcer, more expensive fossil fuels, most of which would have to come from abroad. 

That was then. Today, the energy picture couldn't be more different. 

In the mid-2000s, the fracking revolution took off, making the US the largest oil and natural gas producer in the world. But clean energy began surging as well. Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which created new incentives to deploy wind and solar power. Batteries became better and cheaper. Just about every carmaker now has an electric vehicle for sale. These weren't just the product of steady advances but breakthroughs — new inventions, policies, and expanding economies of scale that aligned prices and performance to push energy technologies to unexpected heights. 

So what will come next? That's the challenge for those charged with building tomorrow's energy infrastructure. And right now, the world is especially uncertain about what's to come, with overall energy demand experiencing major growth for the first time in decades, in part due to power-hungry data centers behind AI. The policy chaos from the Trump administration and looming threats of tariffs are making it even harder for the global energy sector to invest and build for the future.

If you're running a utility, building a factory, or designing power transmission routes, how do you even begin to plan? 

To think through this conundrum, I spoke to Erin Baker. She is a professor of engineering and the faculty director of the Energy Transition Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She has studied technology and policy changes in the energy sector for decades, with an eye toward how to make big decisions under uncertain circumstances. 

I asked her about whether there are any other big step changes on the horizon for technologies that can help us contain climate change, and what we can do to stack the deck in their favor. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. 

Can you define “breakthrough” or explain how it's different from an incremental advance? 

A lot of really important innovation has been incremental. We've had amazing “breakthroughs” in a way with batteries, with wind energy, but it has happened over time. An example of a kind of a breakthrough was fracking, because that was a revolution, but for a long time, everybody ignored the importance of all the various technologies horizontal drilling, shale fracture fluid, subsurface mapping] developing in the background, or didn't think it was going to happen. That one was a big step change when the price, performance, and shale gas field discoveries converged. 

Whereas with solar, it just kept getting cheaper consistently faster than we expected. One way you can define “breakthrough” is you can look at what everyone's expecting and see when you do better than that. So breakthroughs are kind of surprises. 

So perhaps it's better to think of a breakthrough not necessarily as an invention, but rather a point at which a technology becomes viable?

Right. 

Then can you put the recent clean tech advances we've seen into context? Have we seen anything like this before? 

I think that we've always had a lot of technological change. I don't think it's just around clean energy. If there is some kind of incentive, then energy developers will be very clever at finding solutions. As we realize that renewable energy has a lot of benefits to it, the more we focused on it, the more we were like, “Whoa, this is 10 times better than anybody thought it was going to be.” 

With clean energy, a big part of the rationale is its environmental and climate benefits, rather than simply profit. There's sort of a moral motivation baked in. Does that motivation matter? 

For many technologies, there are always true believers. Most people who get really excited about an invention are not just trying to make a profit. I think they're almost always really into the technology itself. 

So with renewable energy, people have been excited for a very, very long time. That excitement tided people over for many years when those sources weren't all that profitable. Solar took a long time for it to become great. The reason people focused on it was because of their vision that this has such potential for energy and the environment. So I think that the moral dimension does play a role.

With a trade war kicking off, a lot of the raw materials and finished products in clean energy are likely to get more expensive. Is there a chance of backsliding in clean energy progress? 

I don't think we're going to lose the technology advances. [Development] can slow down. We saw that for offshore wind, with the COVID-induced inflation and higher interest rates slowing the industry down. We're not losing any benefits of the technology though, and in fact it will probably induce new technological change. To me those kinds of things are temporary. Trade wars and stuff like that, they're bad. They will slow things down, but they won't stop innovation.

There's also competition against clean energy. You talked about fracking and how that was an unexpected breakthrough. I remember in the 1990s people were talking about peak oil, and then that discussion went away because we just kept finding more oil and more exploitable resources. It seems like those same price and performance pressures on clean tech to improve also apply on the fossil side, and there's still a ton of money and innovation there.

Are there any breakthroughs in fossil energy that could counteract progress in clean tech?

That is a good point. Yeah, that peak oil thing used to drive me crazy. When it was a big thing, what I kept trying to explain to people that the industry will just innovate. The higher the price of oil gets, the more we're going to figure out how to get oil out of the ground. 

There could be more innovations in fossil fuels, but where we are in the US, climate change is a very real problem and it's hitting people today. It's not going away. I think that the majority of focus on innovation is going to be things that can help us deal with climate change while living high-quality lives. 

Being at a university, I see that the young bright students are not dying to get into fossil fuels. Most of them want to build a world that's going to be liveable for them, for their children. That gets back to what you were saying: Does it matter what the underlying reason is for innovating? And I guess when I think of it that way, it does matter. Young people want to make a better world. And so they are excited to go into clean energy, not into dirty energy.

How do we start planning for another step change in clean energy? How do we prepare for stuff that we haven't invented yet?

Investing in science and engineering is obviously a good idea if we want to have more kinds of scientific breakthroughs. But yeah, given that we don't know what the technology of tomorrow is going to look like, we really want to focus on flexibility and adaptability in the near term. 

Something that I think is important but not always very sexy or appealing is to streamline the grid interconnection process. Every time a new energy project wants to connect to the power grid they have to get into this interconnection queue. The grid operators have to do a study and see how it's going to affect the rest of the grid. That process is really slow and inefficient; it can take years and years for things to get on the grid. 

Speeding that up is something that's going to be useful broadly. You don't need to predict if it's going to be enhanced geothermal or if it's going to be new versions of solar that will win out to get that queue working better. 

Similarly, we need to build new transmission where and when it's needed. It would be independent of where we end up on the energy supply side. Some of these battery technologies are facilitating distributed resources like rooftop solar and microgrids. Thinking about just how to integrate them on the main power grid would be useful. 

What do you see as the government's role in facilitating this?

Certainly investing in science and engineering. A lot of it is also setting goals for specific technologies. It's important because it coordinates the supply chain. That's something that state or federal governments could do if they really have a vision. It doesn't even cost very much money. A lot of it is reviewing and streamlining regulatory processes to make sure that regulation is doing what it should do. 

What about things like investing in companies or offering financing to startups? 

One thing that I think is really interesting is the idea of green bonds so that you can borrow money at a lower interest rate when what you're doing is good for the environment. I don't think that involves the government exactly picking companies; it just means you're making this money available if you follow certain guidelines. 

Permitting risk is a kind of a bureaucratic risk, and the government could reduce that by understanding if there's going to be a huge public pushback in building a certain area rather than every developer going out to do all their own individual work. 

One example is offshore wind in Europe. There, the state does a lot of work before the developers get there in understanding the specific sites. By the time they allocate the regions to build, they've done a lot of the work that takes a lot of the risk out of it, and then they put it up for bids to private companies. Mechanisms like that can be really useful.

For energy project developers, how do you decide whether to use what you can get off the shelf now versus waiting a few years, maybe another decade, for something better?

A friend of mine many years ago did some research on that, and basically she found that if things are improving at a pretty fast rate, it's almost always worth it to go ahead and invest in what you have now because you're going to get a lot of value out of it. Yes, it's possible that 10 years from now, it'll be something even better, but you're already getting a lot of value from what you're doing.

I don't see many developers waiting around for a better technology. I think we have a lot of good options.

            The Trump administration appears open to negotiations with Harvard, even after America's most prestigious university sued the federal government – setting up a clash over academic freedom, federal funding and campus oversight.
    


            Last week, administration officials reached out to Harvard representatives three times in an effort to restart talks, a person familiar with the outreach told CNN. The nation's oldest university indicated it was not interested in negotiating, the person said.
    


            Two sources tell CNN all outreach attempts were informal.
    


            Barring a settlement, the legal showdown over frozen federal funds will likely take years to play out and could end up at the Supreme Court.
    


            At one point, before the filing of the lawsuit, Harvard President Alan Garber considered meeting with President Donald Trump, The New York Times reported Tuesday.
    


            A White House official told CNN, “The President is always willing to meet with leaders from across the nation on issues he is focused on.” However, the official added, “No meeting is under consideration at this time.”
    


            Some of the university's donors urged the institution's secretive board, the Harvard Corporation, to make a deal with the administration last week, something the corporation isn't currently interested in doing, The Times also reported.
    


            The administration intends to continue a dialogue with Harvard, said Education Secretary Linda McMahon, insisting the White House's recent demands are not about curbing freedom of speech.
    


            Harvard has emerged as a symbol of resistance against Trump, who has been trying to “reclaim” colleges and universities and has framed the conflict as a fight against antisemitism. The university says the White House is trying to control the Harvard community.
    


            The White House official compared conversations around federal funding for higher educational institutions to Trump's tariff policies – subject to negotiation. “President Trump is a results-driven president. … He truly wants to have a deal at the end of the day,” the official said.
    


            The Trump administration has already rolled back diversity, equity and inclusion programs, arrested international students and revoked their visas, and frozen federal funding for schools that refused to submit to its demands.
    


            Harvard said the administration has cut the funds to gain “leverage” over the university and the move is part of a “pressure campaign” to force the school to submit to governmental control, according to court documents.
    


            The government's actions “threaten Harvard's academic independence” and “are part of a broader effort by the Government to punish Harvard for protecting its constitutional rights,” Harvard's lawyers wrote.

            The new Harvard lawsuit argues the Trump administration has failed to establish any tie between the crucial funding cuts and fighting antisemitism.
    


            “The Government has not – and cannot – identify any rational connection between antisemitism concerns and the medical, scientific, technological, and other research it has frozen that aims to save American lives, foster American success, preserve American security, and maintain America's position as a global leader in innovation,” said the lawsuit, filed in Boston federal court.
    


            The case has been assigned to US District Court Judge Allison Burroughs, an Obama nominee who was involved in a previous landmark case involving the university. Burroughs, who did not earn her bachelor's or law degree from Harvard, upheld Harvard's admissions process in a 2019 ruling that was overturned by the Supreme Court's landmark decision ending race-conscious admissions in American colleges.
    


            Harvard's suit against the Trump administration comes as prominent Jewish organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League and Harvard's chapter of the Hillel student organization, have publicly questioned the administration's broad attacks on the university.
    


            “(S)huttering apolitical, life-saving research; targeting the university's tax-exempt status; and threatening all student visas … is neither focused nor measured, and stands to substantially harm the very Jewish students and scholars it purports to protect,” Harvard Hillel wrote Saturday.
    


            The escalation between Harvard and the Trump administration intensified quickly, according to court documents.
    


            In March, the federal government sent a letter to Harvard saying the school was being investigated for its failures to “curb or combat” antisemitism on campus. A similar letter with demands for policy changes had been sent to Columbia University, and federal agencies soon announced a review of more than $5 billion in grants to the Ivy League school.
    


            Antisemitic incidents on college campuses increased by 84% between 2023 and 2024, accounting for 18% of all incidents, an annual audit from the Anti-Defamation League said Tuesday. Some occurred during protests between mid-April and mid-May 2024 in response to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.
    


            Columbia later announced several changes to address the Trump administration's demands, an apparent concession to the federal government.
    


            The White House continued targeting universities — Princeton, Cornell and Northwestern all had funds frozen or suspended — and on April 11 sent Harvard a list of policy changes it wanted implemented, demanding “immediate cooperation” if the university wanted to “maintain Harvard's financial relationship with the federal government.”
    


            The list included eliminating the school's diversity, equity and inclusion programs, banning masks at campus protests, merit-based hiring and admissions reforms and reducing the power held by faculty and administrators “more committed to activism than scholarship.”

Analysis: The real stakes in Trump's confrontation with Harvard



            A New York Times report suggested the letter inadvertently had been sent prematurely. Still, Harvard put out a response three days later, publicly rebuking the Trump administration, saying it would not “surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”
    


            The Trump administration retaliated by freezing $2.2 billion in multiyear grants and contracts, making plans to rescind Harvard's tax-exempt status and threatening the school's ability to host international students.
    


            The school sued days later.
    


            If the case were to end up at the Supreme Court, it would be heard by a bench that includes four Harvard alumni: liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, along with Justice Neil Gorsuch and Chief Justice John Roberts, both conservatives.
    


            Justices are unlikely to recuse themselves from a case based solely on having studied at an institution involved. Jackson recused herself from a case involving affirmative action at Harvard because she was on the school's board of overseers; the other three Harvard alumni ruled in that groundbreaking case.
    


            “I think Harvard, for now, is insisting on treatment that's consistent with law,” former US Treasury Secretary and former Harvard University President Larry Summers told CNN's Kaitlan Collins Tuesday. “It seems to me plain to anybody who reads the statute that … the Trump administration is in massive violation of the law.
    


            Billions of dollars, along with jobs, research and Harvard's ability to administer financial aid are not the only things at stake. The “standing of American higher education” is also on the table, Harvard President Garber said Monday in a statement.
    


            Garber signed a letter with more than 100 presidents of colleges, universities and scholarly societies, opposing the Trump administration's pressure on academic institutions.

            “As leaders of America's colleges, universities, and scholarly societies, we speak with one voice against the unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American higher education,” said the letter released Tuesday by the American Association of Colleges and Universities.
    


            “We are open to constructive reform and do not oppose legitimate government oversight. However, we must oppose undue government intrusion in the lives of those who learn, live, and work on our campuses,” wrote the presidents – including leaders of Princeton and American universities – adding, “The price of abridging the defining freedoms of American higher education will be paid by our students and our society.”
    


            McMahon, the education secretary, reitereted the adminstration's stance.
    


            “I made it very clear that these are not First Amendment infractions. This is civil rights. This is making sure that students on all campuses can come and learn and be safe … and that is why we have had these funds either withheld or frozen during this period of time of negotiation,” she said on CNBC's “Squawk Box.”

            McMahon did not respond directly to a question about whether the Trump administration's demand in its April 11 letter for “viewpoint diversity” among Harvard students, faculty and departments, to be audited by a third party, is really about free speech.
    


            “We had hoped Harvard would come back to the table to discuss these. We would like to have viewpoint diversity,” the education secretary replied. The letter, she added, “was intended to have both parties sit down again and continue their negotiations.”
    


            The White House official who discussed conversations about funding cast the response from Harvard as “grandstanding” and “political antics” that “set back the good faith negotiations on our part.”
    


            It is the White House's hope, this official said, that Harvard “comes to the table and corrects course.”
    


            “Money speaks and when money is getting dried up because their donors aren't buying into what they're selling anymore and the federal government isn't there to pad their pockets, they want to remain the envy of the world when it comes to research and science and academia – and they can only do that if they work with this administration,” the official said.
    


            The ultimate goal, the official said, is to “end antisemitism, end discrimination, end inequality” with the hope of “universities that don't take advantage of the American people and don't bloat systems to overpay professors that look down on the American people.”
    


            “This is an easy thing to resolve if the other side wants to play ball,” the official said, pointing to agreements made between the Trump administration and some law firms it has targeted.
    


            Garber said last week the demands in the letter were “unprecedented” and made “to control the Harvard community,” adding that the university “will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”
    


            One of Harvard's best-known educators, constitutional law professor emeritus Laurence Tribe, said he believes the university's decision to take the administration to court will give courage to other embattled institutions.
    


            “I think that Harvard is encouraging many others to stand up, because when we win – and we will – they will realize that going along with dictatorial demands doesn't get them anywhere,” Tribe told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday.
    


            Harvard, the world's wealthiest university, has an endowment of $53 billion, which could help cushion cuts. About 80% of that money is earmarked for financial aid, scholarships, faculty chairs, academic programs or other projects, according to the school. The remaining 20% is intended to sustain the institution's future.
    


            But the lawsuit paints a bleak picture of that future if Harvard has to dip into university coffers for too long. Eventually, Harvard will be left operating at “a significantly reduced level,” the complaint says.
    


            “If Harvard continues to replace the frozen funding from its own resources, it will be forced to reduce the number of graduate students it admits and the number of faculty and research staff it pays to conduct research,” the lawsuit says.
    


            The Trump administration's threats against Harvard's tax-exempt status and its ability to host international students could put even more pressure on the university's funding, and more federal money could get withheld.
    


            The National Institutes of Health announced Monday it would pull medical research funding from universities with diversity and inclusion programs. Of the $686 million in Harvard's federal research funding in fiscal year 2024, $488 million came from NIH, according to the Harvard Crimson.
    


            The government is “slamming on the brakes” on research and the “victims will be future patients,” Garber said. Research on childhood cancer, infectious disease outbreaks and how to ease the pain of soldiers wounded on the battlefield would all be affected, Garber added.
    


            The indiscriminate cuts, he said, would undermine America's position as a global leader in innovation, adding, “The consequences of the government's overreach will be severe and long-lasting.”
    


            Harvard's many partnerships with other universities, private companies, and state and local agencies mean the freeze on funding will touch off widespread economic harm, the lawsuit argues, noting, “Harvard is one of Massachusetts' largest employers.”
    


            “The freeze creates a ripple effect extending beyond Harvard's campus by stifling job creation in the research sector across the nation, reducing intellectual property development, and delaying scientific and medical advances that boost the national economy,” the lawsuit says.

            A delegation of congressional members traveled to Louisiana Tuesday to demand the release of Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk and inspect conditions at the two Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities where the two remain in custody.
    


            It's the first time a congressional delegation has met with Khalil or Ozturk.
    


            Khalil, a Columbia University graduate, and Ozturk, a Tufts University PhD student, have been in ICE custody for more than a month after being arrested near their homes by federal agents.
    


            The Democrat delegation, led by Rep. Troy Carter of Louisiana traveled to Jena, where Khalil is being held, and then two hours south to Basile, where Ozturk is detained. The group included Reps. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, Ayanna Pressley and Jim McGovern of Massachusetts and Sen. Ed Markey.
    


            The facilities were clean but “chilly” according to Carter, who said detainees complained of cold temperatures at night, making it difficult to sleep. Carter said the facilities appeared to have been cleaned prior to their visit and that conditions appeared to be “fine” while they visited.
    


            Following the visit, lawmakers said the detainees they met with also complained about a lack of medical care, food and religious accommodations.
    


            McGovern referred to Khalil and Ozturk as “political prisoners.”
    


            “I really worry that this administration is ushering in a new era of McCarthyism. And unless Congress and unless the American people stand up and push back, they will succeed,” McGovern said during a press conference after the visits.
    


            Markey accused the Trump administration of wanting to “make an example” out of Khalil and Ozturk in an effort to chill free speech. Markey also said ICE had intentionally transferred them to Louisiana for political reasons.
    


            Through the Trump administration, ICE feels “they have a right to take people from across our country, and to put them into facilities like this here in Louisiana,” Markey said. “And why did they do that? They have done that in order to go to the single most conservative Circuit Court of Appeals in the United States of America.”
    


            “Rümeysa Öztürk is my constituent, an accomplished scholar, and a valued member of our Massachusetts community. Like Rümeysa, Mahmoud Kahlil has committed no crime and is being punished by Donald Trump simply for exercising his right to free speech,” Pressley said in a statement to CNN prior to the visits.

            The Trump administration has accused Khalil of engaging in activities in support of Hamas following his high-profile participation in protests against the Israel-Hamas war on the campus of Columbia last year. It has also accused Ozturk of being a terrorist sympathizer after she co-wrote and published an op-ed in the university newspaper, which was critical of the school's response to the war last year.
    


            Neither Khalil or Ozturk has been charged with a crime.
    


            Both have sued the Trump administration in federal court and have filed multiple motions challenging the legality of their detentions.
    


            Khalil, a US permanent legal resident who is married to a US citizen, was detained in March. On Monday, his attorneys said ICE denied Khalil a special accommodation to attend the birth of his firstborn son.
    


            Ozturk, a Turkish national, has experienced multiple asthma attacks while in custody and has not had access to her medication, according to court documents and her attorneys. A federal judge in Vermont issued a decision last week ordering ICE to transfer her back from Louisiana to Vermont by May 1 while her case continues to play out.
    


            Tuesday's visit follows a series of recent trips by Washington lawmakers who have traveled to visit people who are in custody as a result of Trump's immigration crackdown.
    


            US Sen. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, met Monday with Mohsen Madawi, a prominent organizer of pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University who was detained during his final citizenship interview in Vermont last week.
    


            Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland traveled to El Salvador last week where he met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia. This week, four House Democrats also traveled to El Salvador seeking the release of Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent believes the United States's trade war with China will wind down soon.

Bessent gave the remarks in a private speech in Washington, D.C., for JPMorgan Chase, adding that the conflict is not “sustainable.”

“I do say China is going to be a slog in terms of the negotiations,” Bessent said, according to a transcript of his remarks obtained by the Associated Press. “Neither side thinks the status quo is sustainable.” 

However, he mentioned two to three years as the likely timeframe where a comprehensive deal between the countries would be struck, according to sources speaking with Bloomberg who attended the event. The current situation is essentially a trade embargo, Bessent suggested.

China and the U.S. have enforced massive tariffs on goods entering their borders from the opposing country. China put a 125% tariff on U.S. products, while the U.S. has a 145% tariff on Chinese goods.

President Donald Trump and his administration are negotiating with several countries/unions on deals regarding the tariffs, including Japan, South Korea, the European Union, and others.

Trump said the U.S. was “doing fine” with China when asked about Bessent's comments, adding that he did not anticipate a “hardball” negotiation. He added that he'd be “very good to China” and that he doubts the final tariff will be close to 145%.

“We're going to be very nice,” Trump said. “They're going to be very nice, and we'll see what happens. But ultimately, they have to make a deal, because otherwise they're not going to be able to deal in the United States.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump also told her that the U.S. was “doing very well in respect to a potential trade deal with China.” She added that 18 different nations had brought trade offers to the White House and the president's trade team was meeting with 34 countries this week about possible agreements.

Elon Musk's DOGE:

International Business Machines Corp. dropped in extended trading after its results weren't strong enough to quell investors' concerns that tariffs and federal cost cuts will dent the company's business.

First-quarter sales increased almost 1% to $14.5 billion, IBM said Wednesday in a statementBloomberg Terminal. Profit, excluding some items, was $1.60 per share. Both results exceeded analysts' average estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Big banks like Citigroup and Natixis thought they were backing a $1 billion fintech darling. But when Stenn blew up, most of its supposed partners said they had never worked with the company.

Every week during the years leading up to its sudden collapse in December, Stenn Technologies sent an email to some of the world's biggest finance firms.

The emails contained pages of data from a trade-finance deal that London-based Stenn had arranged that grew to almost $1 billion in size, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg and people familiar with the matter. Citigroup Inc., BNP Paribas SA, Natixis and HSBC Holdings Plc were among the biggest investors while Barclays Plc, M&G Plc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s asset-management unit had also backed the transaction.

Businesses dealing with the early stages of President Donald Trump's tariffs are looking for ways to pass increasing costs onto consumers, according to a Federal Reserve report Wednesday.

As Trump ordered against-the-board levies on U.S. imports and higher duties on Chinese products, the Fed's Beige Book indicated how they plan to proceed. Companies reported getting notices from suppliers about rising costs, and they looked to find ways not to absorb the increases while noting uncertainty over the ability to pass them along to customers.

"Most Districts noted that firms expected elevated input cost growth resulting from tariffs," the report said. "Many firms have already received notices from suppliers that costs would be increasing."

Broadly speaking, the report, which comes out about every seven weeks, characterized economic growth as "little changed" from the March 5 report, though it noted that "uncertainty around international trade policy was pervasive across" the Fed's 12 districts.

Prices generally rose during the period, which included Trump's April 2 "liberation day" announcement of the blanket tariffs. Employment was "little changed" amid falling headcounts in government jobs.

"Firms reported adding tariff surcharges or shortening pricing horizons to account for uncertain trade policy," the report stated. "Most businesses expected to pass through additional costs to customers. However, there were reports about margin compression amid increased costs, as demand remained tepid in some sectors, especially for consumer-facing firms."

In the New York area, firms reported rising prices particularly in food and insurance along with construction materials. Manufacturers and distributors said they already are adding surcharges due to shipments.

There also were signs of problems in the trade dispute with Canada. Tourists are booking fewer hotel rooms in New York City and at least one tech firm reported losing business contacts in Canada.

"The outlook for service sector firms worsened noticeably, with contacts anticipating a sharp decline in activity in the coming months. Service sector firms reported a major pullback in planned investment," the report said.

The report also noted the impact that the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency has had on employment in the Washington, D.C. region. DOGE has sought to pare back the federal workforce, laying off thousands and offering buyouts to others.

While the employment picture overall was "unchanged" for the period, "many federal government workers were laid off or put on administrative leave in recent weeks."

"These cuts to the federal workforce have impacted businesses throughout the entire district. In addition, federal contractors have laid off workers in response to spending cuts. For example, a research organization headquartered outside the DC-region laid off workers due to contracts being cancelled. Similarly, a Northern Virginia consultancy reduced headcount by 25 percent due to losing half their contracts," the report added.

Elsewhere in the report, service organizations dependent on government support noted difficulties since the White House began culling through agencies that get federal aid. The report specifically cited food banks in New York as seeing cuts in programs and personnel.

"Contacts at non-profits and other community-based organizations expressed significant concern about the future of federal funding and services support, creating challenges in staffing, strategy, and planning," the report said.

Discord co-founder and CEO Jason Citron is stepping down from the gaming-focused social messaging service, the startup said Wednesday.

Citron will be replaced by former Activision Blizzard Vice Chairman Humam Sakhnini, who will assume the reigns as Discord CEO and join the company's board on Monday. Citron will remain on Discord's board and become an advisor to the CEO, the company said.

In a public memo to employees, Citron said "it feels like the right time" to move on from the executive role and that the company has a "clear strategy, new business lines to grow into, love and passion from our users, and an incredible team of people working tirelessly to deliver for them."

"The job of a CEO is constantly evolving, and over the years I have continuously 'hired myself out of a job,'" Citron wrote. "Usually that means delegating work and then taking on different leadership challenges. However, as I look at what is needed of Discord's CEO over the next few years, I realize that it's time for me to literally 'hire myself out of a job.'"

Citron credited Sakhnini's 15-year experience in the video game industry as helping steer the startup he co-founded alongside Chief Technology Officer Stanislav Vishnevskiy in 2012, when it was initially a gaming studio before its 2015 pivot to online communications.

At Activision Blizzard, Sakhnini helped oversee major gaming franchises such as World of Warcraft, Call of Duty and Candy Crush, the company said. Vishnevskiy will remain Discord's CTO.

Discord's executive change comes amid media reports that it met with investment bankers to discuss a possible initial product offering as soon as this year. A Discord spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that it does "not comment on rumors or speculation" and that it is focused on "delivering the best possible experience for our users and building a strong, sustainable business."

A member of CNBC's Disruptor 50 list, Discord has roughly 200 million global monthly active users who access its "servers" to discuss shared interests using text, voice or video. Discord has raised a total of $1.1 billion and is valued at around $14.7 billion, according to PitchBook.

WATCH: Discord held talks on IPO.

Microsoft is offering a new choice to employees who are deemed low performers: Accept a payout to quit or risk termination on a performance improvement plan.

An internal email sent to Microsoft managers on Friday disclosed the company's new "globally consistent" performance improvement plan with "clear expectations and a timeline for improvement."

Affected employees can enter the PIP or quit and accept a "Global Voluntary Separation Agreement (GVSA)," the email, viewed by Business Insider, said.

"This performance improvement process is available year-round so you can act quickly to transparently address performance issues, while offering employees choice," said the email, which was from  Amy Coleman, Microsoft's new chief people officer.

Another internal Microsoft document viewed by BI said that the payout to employees would be equal to 16 weeks of pay. Affected staff have five days to decide which option to take. If they choose to start the PIP, the payout is off the table, this internal document said.

The new PIP system may work differently outside the US, as other countries have different laws. Microsoft declined to comment.

Microsoft's approach is similar to Amazon's Pivot program, which offers a PIP option or a payout if the employee leaves.

BI has reported extensively on Pivot, a central cog in a broader Amazon performance review system that some employees have said is designed to meet firing quotas rather than revive careers.

Amazon has defended its system in the past. In 2021, the company told BI that it provided managers "with tools to help employees improve their performance and grow in their careers." It added: "This includes resources for employees who are not meeting expectations and may require additional coaching."

The latest changes come as Microsoft, and the tech industry overall, shifts toward more rigorous performance expectations and less coddling.

Earlier this year, Microsoft fired 2,000 employees deemed underperformers without severance.

Leaders in at least some parts of the company are considering additional performance-based cuts as soon as May. They're looking at cutting middle managers and how to increase the ratio of coders versus noncoders on projects.

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said US tariffs may be more disinflationary than inflationary for Europe even as more time is needed to fully assess the situation.

“It is very unclear what the net impact will be,” she said at a Washington Post event. “Particularly if there is no countermeasures decided by Europe, I think the net inflation is uncertain at the moment, but probably it's going to be disinflationary more than inflationary.”

The Consumer Brands Association had previously proposed that manufacturers voluntarily begin phasing out synthetic dyes.

The US Department of Health and Human Services said Tuesday it plans to work with food companies to phase out use of many artificial food colorings by 2026, but industry lobbyists say there's no agreement in place to remove the dyes, according to people familiar with the matter.

In its announcement, HHS said it planned to eliminate artificial food dyes by working with companies that rely heavily on them. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said his agency and the Food and Drug Administration had an “understanding” with the industry about their removal on a voluntary basis.

Caroline Smith, an accounting director from Verona, New Jersey, and her husband took their two children to Italy for Easter break this month. On the Spanish Steps in Rome, they ran into another family from their town. Two other families from the same area were also independently visiting Italy at the same time, she said.

The families are part of an emerging trend in the $11 trillion global travel industry: Americans are traveling abroad in droves, while the number of visitors to the United States is falling.

Foreign visitors to the United States by air fell nearly 10% in March from the same month a year earlier and nearly 13% from before the pandemic to 4.54 million people, according to data from the International Trade Administration, part of the Commerce Department.

Easter week last year was in March, causing some vacations to shift this year. However, U.S. citizens flying abroad increased 1.6% from last March and are up 22% from 2019 to 6.56 million travelers.

The imbalance could further deepen the more than $50 billion gap between what the U.S. generates through travel and tourism services and what Americans spend abroad. It's a concern for the U.S. travel industry, which brings in about $1 trillion a year. The U.S. Travel Association on Jan. 9 said it expected a more than 12% increase in spending from international tourism in the United States this year.

An on-again, off-again trade war, high-profile detentions of visitors as well as visa holders and permanent residents, along with President Donald Trump's rhetoric about taking over countries like Canada, and a strong U.S. dollar for much of this year and travel warnings haven't helped drum up demand from international travelers.

The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

"This points to potentially another channel to consider in assessing the effect of tariffs on economic activity," JPMorgan said in a note Wednesday, adding that a decline in foreign travel spending could subtract around 0.1% from the gross domestic product this year. "Concerns around detentions of foreign visitors, sometimes by accident, are only compounding this effect."

Samuel Engel, senior vice president at consulting firm ICF, said that while "there's no question that foreigners are finding the U.S. less welcoming" another question is if the hesitance to travel to the U.S. from abroad is now showing up in international business travel.

"Business people don't ink deals in the face of uncertainty," he said.

United Airlines last week said bookings from international passengers originating in Europe are down 6%, while those originating in Canada are down 9% year over year. Delta Air Lines said it was seeing a similar phenomenon.

But American consumers' appetite for international trips is helping to soften the blow of fewer international tourists and weaker-than-expected demand in domestic U.S. travel for some companies, like United and Delta, which are cutting back flights within the United States later this year.

"I traveled around Europe a lot pre-kids so I've been trying to do the same with the family now that the kids are older," said Smith, 44, who has a 7-year-old and an 11-year-old. "We went to Spain in 2023 and Portugal in 2024, chosen in part because the flights are short, in comparison to Greece, which is on the list."

Grace Cular Yee, a travel agent based in Virginia, said a lot of her clients are considering international travel more than domestic in part because they're wanting to splash out on college graduation trips since their kids largely missed out on high school commencement celebrations during Covid.

"This is a major milestone for the whole family," she said, adding that while many travelers get ideas from social media, more Americans are also getting inspired by television shows, like the latest season of "The White Lotus," which was set in Thailand. She said she recently planned a trip to France for a mother-daughter high school graduation trip because the daughter loves the show "Emily in Paris."

United said that advanced bookings earlier this month are stable and premium-cabin sales are up 17%, while international demand has risen 5%.

Delta's president, Glen Hauenstein, is optimistic that the trend will continue and said cash sales for international travel are coming in ahead of the same point last year.

"Sales that are coming in the door as of yesterday that we're recording today as cash are very strong for international through the summer all the way out to September, October," he said on an April 9 earnings call, adding that international sales were up on the year.

Many working Americans and retirees are on edge with recent market tumult, but wealthy and aging travelers, particularly in the pricey front of the plane, are helping to offset that.

"Being a baby boomer, I can say this without fear of retribution: There's only so much time to go to Europe or almost so much time to go see Australia or Japan," Hauenstein said on the earnings call. "So you've got this wealth effect where this cohort of retirees is wealthier than any other cohort even with the most recent rundown, and they want to go do things."

It isn't clear whether a pullback in consumer spending in the back of the plane or even some softness in corporate travel growth is a sign that high-end, international leisure travel bookings will weaken, too. For now, the labor market remains strong.

"Everybody's life is not fully disrupted but everybody's life is on more tenuous footing right now," said ICF's Engel. "The way people manage uncertainty is they hold back on decisions."

Correction: Hauenstein spoke on an April 9 earnings call. An earlier version misstated the date.

DEARBORN, Mich. — Ford Motor is launching a program that aims to give its most premium pickup truck customers a more curated, exclusive experience.

The Detroit automaker's new ownership experience is for its "Platinum Plus" customers. The program ranges from offering a personal concierge and virtual tutorial tours to gifts, accessory discounts and a "Ford Protect Premium Maintenance Plan" for 25,000 miles or two years, whichever comes first.

The "Platinum Plus" package is the highest-end version of Ford's 2025 F-Series pickup trucks that start around $100,000 for the automaker's Super Duty vehicles. It replaces "Limited" models as the priciest pickups for Ford.

"We think it's a competitive advantage, this whole experience. So we're excited about that potential to grow that into the future," Brian Rathsburg, marketing manager for Ford F-Series Super Duty, said during an event Tuesday. "When [customers] purchase the top of the lineup for Super Duty, they expect a more premium experience. And we're excited to kind of start with this concept."

The new program essentially groups together many services Ford was offering owners individually, while adding a few new ones. Rathsburg said the program will adapt to include whatever experiences customers want.

In addition to the new program, the Platinum Plus vehicles feature plush "Smoked Truffle" interiors that include Venetian leather and unique exterior design features such as a satin finish grille with bright chrome inserts.

Rathsburg declined to discuss if President Donald Trump's 25% auto tariffs will impact the price of its F-Series Super Duty pickups, including the new Platinum Plus offering.

"That's a very murky, very uncertain, very tenuous space. We're monitoring it," Rathsburg said. "Certainly, there's things down the road that we may not know about, yet we'll react accordingly."

Ford last week told dealers it could increase prices on newly built vehicles next month if Trump doesn't ease tariffs on automotive imports, according to Automotive News. That comes after the company has been offering an employee pricing program to promote its U.S. operations, which are the largest among automakers.

The auto industry has offered more curated, exclusive services in the past, but they have largely been for luxury and premium brands rather than mainstream brands or vehicles like Ford's F-Series.

The new service package follows Ford betting big on such curated services for its "Pro" fleet customers, including more hands-on assistance as well as logistics and fleet management.

"Everything we see says that this is gonna be a nice improvement for consumers," Rathsburg said.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday said that "there is an opportunity for a big deal here" on trade issues between the United States and China.

"If they want to rebalance, let's do it together," Bessent said during an appearance at the Institute of International Trade and Finance in Washington, D.C.

"This is an incredible opportunity. I think if Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio were to write something, he could call it a beautiful rebalancing.

Dalio, on April 13, told NBC News that he was worried that President Donald Trump's tariff and economic policies would threaten the world's economy, potentially to the point of "something worse than a recession."

Trump has imposed ultra-high tariffs on China, of 145%. Shortly before Bessent spoke on Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump administration was considering reducing those tariffs to between 50% and 65%, which would still be extremely high, relatively speaking.

Bessent, in his address to the IITF, outlined what he called "a blueprint to restore equilibrium to the global financial system and the institutions designed to uphold it," specifically the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.

"The IMF and World Bank have enduring value," Bessent said. "But mission creep has knocked these institutions off course. We must enact key reforms to ensure the Bretton Woods institutions are serving their stakeholders — not the other way around."

He said that "Intentional policy choices by other countries have hollowed out America's manufacturing sector and undermined our critical supply chains, putting our national and economic security at risk.

"President Trump has taken strong action to address these imbalances and the negative impacts they have on Americans.  

This status quo of large and persistent imbalances is not sustainable. It is not sustainable for the United States, and ultimately, it is not sustainable for other economies.

Bessent called out the World Bank for lending to nations that have advanced economic growth, including China.

He suggested that the bank stop lending to China.

"The World Bank continues to lend every year to countries that have met the criteria to graduate from World Bank borrowing," Bessent said.

"There is no justification for this continued lending. It siphons off resources from higher priorities and crowds out the development of private markets. It also disincentivizes countries' efforts to move away from dependency on the World Bank and toward job-rich, private sector-led growth."

Bessent added: "Going forward, the Bank must set firm graduation timelines for countries that have long since met the graduation criteria. Treating China — the second-largest economy in the world — as a 'developing country' is absurd.

"While it has been at the expense of many Western markets, China's rise has been rapid and impressive," he said. "If China wants to play a role in the global economy commensurate with its actual importance, then the country needs to graduate up, we welcome that."

The European Union has fined Apple and Meta a combined $800 million for violating antitrust laws.

Is that a big deal?

On the one hand, not at all.

If Apple and Meta end up paying the fines — both companies say they will appeal the rulings from the European Commission — the financial impact will be minimal to the tech giants' bottom lines. Apple generates $93.7 billion in profit a year; Meta does $23.9 billion.

On the other hand, both Apple and Meta are positioning the judgments as fundamental attacks on their businesses. Meta even argues that Europe is attacking America itself.

"The European Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards," Meta comms and policy head Joel Kaplan said in a statement Wednesday.

Apple also weighed in: "Today's announcements are yet another example of the European Commission unfairly targeting Apple in a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free."

The specifics of Europe's complaints about Meta and Apple have to do with the Digital Markets Act. Those rules are meant to constrain the power of giant tech companies — meaning US companies.

In Apple's case, Europe is fining the company because it says it's not complying with rules meant to force Apple to open its powerful App Store to competition. In Meta's case, Europe says the company didn't offer a version of its services that uses less of consumers' personal data.

Both complaints preceded Donald Trump's second presidential victory. But both Apple and Meta are clearly hoping that Trump sees them as something that can be negotiated away as part of his administration's tariff wars. Something like "Europe drops these charges against US tech companies, and the US cuts back on the 20% tariff it's planning to levy on Europe."

At various times, that has seemed like something Trump and his team are interested in pursuing. Like in February, when Trump issued a memo, written with Europe in mind, vowing to "defend American companies and innovators from overseas extortion."

And there's speculation that the EU, which could have fined both Apple and Meta up to 10% of their total annual revenue, came down with much smaller fines because it didn't want to aggravate tariff tensions.

Except … that same Trump administration has been causing headaches of its own for Big Tech companies.

Its on-again/off-again tariffs could cause the price of Apple products to skyrocket, depending on how or if they are implemented. They could also damage Meta by cutting off billions in ad dollars from Chinese companies.

More to the point: The US government itself is currently in court against Meta, arguing that the company should be broken up because of antitrust violations.

It's a pretty baffling set of contradictions. Perhaps the most generous way of interpreting them would be something like: The White House wants to keep Big Tech in line — but it wants to do it itself.

As we've learned, trying to predict what the Trump administration is going to do about just about anything — and especially on trade — is a very difficult task.

On Wednesday, for instance, markets are surging in part because Trump just signaled that he's going to soften his approach to China. But maybe that will be different Thursday or next week. So it's certainly too early to tell what Wednesday's actions mean for Big Tech will ultimately mean.

Apple Antitrust Cases:

The Apple App Store.

Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. were hit by relatively modest European Union fines totaling €700 million ($798 million) for violating tough new antitrust rules for Big Tech, following warnings of harsh retaliation from US President Donald Trump.

EU regulators levied the penalties — €500 million against Apple and €200 million against Meta — under its Digital Markets Act, which includes a list of dos and don'ts mainly aimed at Silicon Valley giants.

The European Union on Wednesday fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros each for breaching the bloc's digital competition laws.

The European Commission, which is the executive body of the EU, said it was fining Apple 500 million euros ($571 million) and Meta 200 million euros ($228.4 million) for breaches of the Digital Markets Act (DMA).

Officials said that Apple failed to comply with so-called "anti-steering" obligations under the DMA. Under the EU's tech law, Apple is required to allow developers to freely inform customers of alternative offers outside its App Store.

The tech giant was ordered by the EU to remove technical and commercial restrictions on steering and to refrain from perpetuating its non-compliant conduct in the future.

Apple said in a statement that it planned to appeal the EU fine while continuing its discussions with the Commission.

"Today's announcements are yet another example of the European Commission unfairly targeting Apple in a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free," Apple said.

"We have spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for. Despite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way," the company added.

For Meta, the EU Commission found that the social media group illegally required users to consent to sharing their data with the company or pay for an ad-free service. This was in response to Meta's introduction of a paid subscription tier for Facebook and Instagram in November 2023.

Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, said in a statement that the Commission was "attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards."

"This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service. And by unfairly restricting personalized advertising the European Commission is also hurting European businesses and economies," Kaplan said.

The EU said its fine for Meta took into account steps that the tech giant took to comply with its rules through a new version of its free personalized ads service that uses less personal data to display advertisement.

"The Commission is currently assessing this new option and continues its dialogue with Meta, requesting the company to provide evidence of the impact that this new ads model has in practice," regulators said.

Meta was sent a cease-and-desist order by the EU ordering it to make changes to its less personalized ads option over the coming 60 days or face further fines, according to a source familiar with the matter, who asked to remain anonymous as the information is not public.

The antitrust decision risks potential retaliation from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has made no secret of his displeasure with the EU's regulatory enforcement actions on America's digital giants.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration imposed so-called "reciprocal" tariffs of 20% on EU goods entering the U.S. He later dropped the new tariff rates on dozens of trading partners — including the EU — to 10% for a limited time period for trade negotiations.

The reciprocal tariffs came after Trump earlier issued a directive threatening to impose tariffs on Europe to combat what he called "overseas extortion" of American tech companies through digital services taxes, fines, practices and policies.

A mission to launch Project Kuiper satellites was scrubbed on April 9.

Amazon.com Inc.'s internet-from-space venture is struggling to ramp up production, jeopardizing its ability to meet a government deadline to have more than 1,600 satellites in orbit by next summer. 

Project Kuiper has completed just a few dozen satellites so far, more than a year into its manufacturing program, according to three people familiar with the situation. The slow pace, combined with rocket launch delays, means the company will probably have to seek an extension from the Federal Communications Commission, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters.

BAE Systems says it's about to radically increase its production of 155mm shells, leaning on advances in how it produces munitions.

The UK defense contractor said its new production methods are a "major breakthrough" that will allow it to reach a sixteenfold increase in 155mm shell manufacturing by the summer.

As a result, it says it will not only be able to meet the UK's demand, but will also begin to supply for export by the end of 2026.

The announcement comes amid ongoing anxiety about the UK's stockpiles of key ammunition, having sent Ukraine half a million artillery rounds as of February this year.

It also appears to address a wider global scramble toward reducing dependence on imports and having homegrown access to critical resources and manufacturing capabilities.

BAE Systems' new approach is twofold, affecting the production of both explosives and propellants for shells.

A new formulation for propellants has been developed, it said, reducing the need for nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin, compounds that are in high demand across multiple industries worldwide.

Meanwhile, RDX explosives — the key explosive in 155mm shells — are to be produced through continuous flow processing, a method that's common in manufacturing but has not yet been applied in defense.

It essentially means that shells are made in an uninterrupted process at smaller scale, rather than in large batches, an approach that, in other industries, has resulted in much greater efficiency.

BAE Systems has until now been reliant on the US and France for its supply of RDX.

Trevor Taylor, director of the Defence, Industries & Society Programme at the Royal United Services Institute, outlined the advantages of the new process.

A small-scale process avoids safety risks associated with a single large production plant, Taylor told BI.

He added that the company's ambition is likely to be "to control costs at lower production rates, and to be able to surge production levels by operating more hours when needed without a large labor force that would be idle in less pressing times."

A senior BAE Systems executive with knowledge of the developments told BI that the company plans to sell the technology abroad, promoting other countries' ability to develop sovereign ammunition production.

BAE Systems, like other British defense companies, works in line with the UK Ministry of Defence's priorities and does not sell to the UK's adversaries — meaning that the new system is not likely to end up in Russian hands anytime soon.

The company is the UK's largest defense manufacturer. It won a £2.4 billion ($3.2 billion) government munitions contract in 2020, which was ramped up in 2023 in recognition of the ongoing war in Ukraine.

The company says it's invested £163.5 million, or about $220 million, in new manufacturing sites and tech over the last five years.

Ukrainian drone operators flying their uncrewed aircraft against the threat of Russian jamming are often unsure where their drones actually are, meaning they have to use other guideposts to find their way, an operator told Business Insider.

Directional landmarks can include "weird-looking buildings" or intersections. Operators use these when they can't use GPS to locate themselves and can't be sure exactly where their drones are over fields and treelines that look similar, Dimko Zhluktenko, a drone operator with Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces, told BI.

Drones warfare is a major part of Russia's war against Ukraine, and both sides are rapidly creating and developing new types of drones and counter-drone technology. The countermeasures include electronic warfare like jamming, which can target connections between the drone and its operator or the aircraft's GPS navigation system.

GPS, a satellite-based navigation system, is used in munitions, drones, and civilian technology like digital maps. It plays an essential function in military systems and civilian society, but military leaders are increasingly coming to terms with the reality that modern battlefields may be GPS-denied environments.

Weapons that rely on GPS, including sophisticated US weapons, have run into problems on Ukrainian battlefields.

"At the front line, there is literally no GPS," Zhluktenko said. "So a key issue is that when you're flying with no GPS, the drone thinks that he's in one position while, in fact, he's in completely another position."

Electronic warfare can make location data unreliable, and wind and other factors can knock a drone off course, out of sync with the operator's expectations.

Without GPS, operators have to look at what their drone's camera is showing them and compare it to satellite imagery and maps to figure out where it is.

"And that's why you have to look at the visual markers that you have from the camera: a lake, some weird-looking building, weird intersection, and you just discuss all those markers and use them to navigate through the front line basically."

"The operator, he's looking at the camera, looking at the map, and figuring out where the drone is and where to go next," he said. That's not an easy task, and in some sectors of the front, this can be extremely difficult.

Eastern Ukraine, where most of the fighting is taking place, is very flat and has a largely uniform landscape, making it hard for operators to find those standout features and learn where they are.

Zhluktenko said that in the east of the country, "one of the key issues is that all of those places, they look exactly the same. It's the same kind of field, the same kind of forest, and there are literally no visual markers to figure out where you're at."

The flat landscape has also made other parts of warfare more difficult, like tank and armored assaults. Drones can see them coming from far off.

Another Ukrainian drone operator, who spoke to BI on the condition of anonymity, shared similar experiences, explaining that without GPS, drone operators "have to get oriented using benchmarks." They said that those can include "a building or a lake or a river or some house."

Drones have been used in this war more than in any other war throughout history. From quadcopters to octocopters to large fixed-wing aircraft, drones are running reconnaissance operations, collecting targeting data, dropping bombs, and exploding on targets, and that's just the aerial ones.

These relatively cheap weapons have eliminated assets worth millions of dollars and destroyed targets far from the front. They're radically changing warfare.

And they have been key for Ukraine, which has suffered from shortages of other weaponry. Maj. Gen. Peter Boysen, the commander in chief in Denmark, a significant Ukrainian partner, said this month that attack drones account for more than 70% of Ukrainian kills.

The proliferation of drones means that Russian and Ukrainian industries are in a race to find ways to jam and stop the other country's drones. They are also developing new drones that are resistant to or able to overcome those efforts.

New drone systems include fiber-optic drones, which have a cable between the operator and the drone that prevents them from being jammed, and AI-enabled drones.

First, it was Microsoft. Now Amazon is raising eyebrows on Wall Street as fresh signs suggest the cloud giant may be easing off the accelerator in the race to build AI data centers.

Some analysts are concerned that Amazon Web Services, the dominant cloud provider, may be entering a digestion phase that could slow momentum in the data center market.

The speculation gained traction Monday when the famed short seller Jim Chanos posted a simple and ominous remark on X, alongside an analyst note suggesting caution around AWS's data center plans.

Data Centers #UhOh pic.twitter.com/fRWNFxMV58

That note, published by Wells Fargo analysts, cited industry sources who reported this weekend that AWS paused discussions for certain new colocation data center deals, particularly international ones. The analysts stressed that the scale of the pause remains unclear, though they're worried.

"It does appear like the hyperscalers are being more discerning with leasing large clusters of power, and tightening up pre-lease windows for capacity that will be delivered before the end of 2026," the analysts wrote.

The same day, TD Cowen analysts published similar findings from their own data center research.

"Our most recent checks point to a pullback in US colocation deals from Amazon," they wrote in a note to investors. Colo deals, as they're known in the industry, involve different companies sharing space in the same data center.

"We are aware of select colocation deals that it walked away from, as well as expansion options that it chose not to exercise," the Cowen analysts added.

They also said that their recent industry checks point to a slowdown in Amazon's AI ambitions in Europe.

"This is a dynamic we will continue to monitor," the analysts wrote.

More broadly, Cowen's analysts have spotted a cooling in the data center market, relative to the frenzied activity of recent years.

"We observed a moderation in the exuberance around the outlook for hyperscale demand which characterized the market this time last year," they wrote, laying out three specific signs of calmer times:

Some context is important here. The AI data center market has been gangbusters since OpenAI's ChatGPT burst onto the scene in late 2022 and showed the potential of generative AI technology.

These signs of moderation are pretty small in relation to this huge trend. However, trillions of dollars in current and planned investments are riding on the generative AI boom. With so much money on the line, any inkling that this rocket ship is not ascending at light speed is unnerving.

These signals from Amazon echo similar moves by Microsoft, which recently halted some data center projects.

"Like Microsoft, AWS seems to be digesting recent aggressive leasing activity," the Wells Fargo analysts wrote.

They clarified that this doesn't mean signed deals are being canceled, but rather that AWS is pulling back from early-stage agreements like Letters of Intent or Statements of Qualifications—common ways that cloud providers work with partners to prepare for data center projects.

In response to these growing concerns, Kevin Miller, the vice president of global data centers at AWS, posted on LinkedIn on Monday to offer some clarity.

"We continue to see strong demand for both Generative AI and foundational workloads on AWS," he wrote.

He said that AWS has thousands of cloud customers around the world and must weigh multiple solutions to get them the right capacity at the right time.

"Some options might end up costing too much, while others might not deliver when we need the capacity," Miller wrote. "Other times, we find that we need more capacity in one location and less in another. This is routine capacity management, and there haven't been any recent fundamental changes in our expansion plans."

Miller's comments aim to position the pause not as a red flag, but as part of the normal ebb and flow of data center growth.

Historically, these digestion periods, marked by slowing new leases or deferred builds, can last six to 12 months before a rebound, the Wells Fargo analysts wrote. Google, for instance, pulled back from leasing in the second half of 2024, only to return aggressively in early 2025, they noted.

The Cowen analysts said Amazon's recent cautious moves to pull back on colocation deals may be related to efforts to increase efficiency across its data center operations. Also, AWS typically doesn't do a lot of colocation deals anyway, preferring instead to build its own data centers, the analysts wrote.

They also wrote that other tech giants, such as Meta and Google, are still aggressively pursuing new capacity.

The bottom line? While AWS appears to be taking a breath, the AI cloud race is far from over. Analysts and investors will watch closely to see whether this pause marks a brief recalibration or a more significant shift in AI strategy.

BP shares whipsawed on Wednesday after activist investor Elliott went public with a stake of more than 5% in the struggling British oil major, which has pivoted back to oil in a bid to restore investor confidence.

BP shares provisionally closed 0.3% lower, erasing gains of as much as 5% from earlier in the session. The London-listed stock price is down around 8% year-to-date.

Hedge fund Elliott Management has built its holding in the British oil major to 5.006%, according to a regulatory filing disclosed late Tuesday. BP's other large shareholders include BlackRock, Vanguard and Norway's sovereign wealth fund.

Elliott was first reported to have assumed a position in the oil and gas company back in February, driving a share rally amid expectations that its involvement could pressure BP to shift gears from its green strategy and back toward its core oil and gas businesses.

Within weeks, BP, which has been lagging domestic peer Shell and transatlantic rivals and posted a steep drop in fourth-quarter profit, announced plans to ramp up fossil fuel investments to $10 billion through 2027. This marked a sharp strategic departure for the company, which five years ago became one of the first energy giants to announce plans to cut emissions to net zero "by 2050 or sooner." As part of that push, the company pledged to slash emissions by up to 40% by 2030 and to ramp up investment in renewables projects.

The oil major scaled back this emissions target to 20% to 30% in February 2023, saying at the time that it needed to keep investing in oil and gas to meet global demand.

Since switching gears, BP's CEO Murray Auchincloss and outgoing Chair Helge Lund — who is expected to depart the company in 2026 — retained their posts but were penalized with reduced support during BP's board re-election vote earlier this month amid pressure from both revenue and climate-focused investors.

BP's strategic reset back to the company's oil and gas activities took place just as crude prices began to plunge amid volatility triggered by U.S. tariffs and Washington's trade spat with China, the world's largest crude importer.

Energy analysts have broadly welcomed the strategic reset, and BP CEO Murray Auchincloss has since said the pivot attracted "significant interest" in the firm's non-core assets.

The energy firm nevertheless remains firmly in the spotlight as a potential takeover target, with the likes of Shell and U.S. oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron touted as possible suitors.

BP is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on Tuesday. The company has said it anticipates lower reported upstream production and higher net debt in the first quarter than in the final three months of 2024.

The latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey found that Americans' opinion of how U.S. President Donald Trump is managing the economy has plunged: For the first time since he entered the White House, more respondents disapprove than approve of the president on the economy.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has been a significant contributor to the Trump administration, has also seen a decline in his and his company's reputations. More than 47% of the American public view Tesla negatively, according to the same survey, compared with just 10% for General Motors. As for Musk himself, around half of the respondents see him in a disapproving light.

Markets, however, are open-minded and often react almost instantaneously to any positive changes. On Tuesday, Trump's denial that he wishes to kick Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell out of office, and Musk's clarification that he will be spending less time in Washington, D.C., were enough to send stock indexes and Tesla shares higher — even though the electric vehicle company's first-quarter earnings missed expectations.

Though Cassio in Shakespeare's play Othello describes reputation as "the immortal part" of himself, in the markets, the barometer for character tends to be more forgiving.

'No intention' of firing Powell: TrumpU.S. President Donald Trump has "no intention" of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, he told reporters on Tuesday. "None whatsoever," Trump said in the Oval Office when asked to clarify that he did not seek Powell's removal. "Never did." That said, the president added that he "would like to see [Powell] be a little more active in terms of his idea to lower interest rates."

'De-escalation' in U.S.-China trade war Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a closed-door meeting Tuesday he expects "there will be a de-escalation" in Trump's trade war with China in the "very near future," a person in the room told CNBC. Negotiating with China is likely to be "a slog," Bessent said at a private investor summit hosted by JPMorgan Chase, but added that neither side "thinks the status quo is sustainable."

Markets jump on promising newsU.S. markets rallied Tuesday on Trump and Bessent's statements. The S&P 500 rose 2.51%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.66% and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.71%. Asia-Pacific markets rose sharply Wednesday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped almost 2.5% and Japan's Nikkei 225 added nearly 2%. However, the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday downgraded its growth forecasts for major Asian economies in 2025, citing trade tensions and "high policy uncertainty."

Tesla's earnings fall shortTesla reported Tuesday first-quarter revenue and earnings that missed expectations. Total revenue slid 9% to $19.34 billion from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago. Analysts were expecting a revenue of $21.11 billion and a profit of 39 cents a share, according to LSEG data. Tesla is planning to enter the India market, CFO Vaibhav Tanej said during its earnings call.

Musk says he will spend less time at DOGEDespite Tesla's disappointing earnings, which it announced after the bell, its shares popped more than 5% in extended trading. Investors could be cheering CEO Elon Musk's statement that his time spent running Trump's Department of Government Efficiency will drop "significantly" starting in May. As of Monday, Tesla shares were down 44% for the year, generating $11.5 billion in mark-to-market profits for Tesla shorts in 2025.

[PRO] Safe-haven currency amid flight from U.S.As the U.S. dollar slides and the stock market whipsaws, investors are piling into one safe-haven currency. An exchange-traded fund linked to it has surged 8% in April, bringing its 2025 gains to 11%. Paul Feinstein, Audent Global Asset Management CEO, called the currency "one of the most enduring safe havens."  

U.S. regulatory scrutiny fans Chinese stock delisting fears

Increased regulatory scrutiny of U.S.-listed Chinese firms has stoked delisting worries, threatening the decade-plus run of Alibaba and other Chinese companies on U.S. exchanges.

A broad "everything is on the table" comment from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on April 9 has reignited fears on Wall Street that hundreds of billions of dollars may flow out in a forced delisting of Chinese stocks from U.S. exchanges.

Thanks to the latest version of a law made in 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission can prompt a Chinese stock delisting if the company is deemed noncompliant with audit requests for two straight years. Paul Atkins, sworn in on Monday as SEC chairman, indicated during a hearing last month that he would uphold that process for scrutinizing U.S.-listed Chinese stocks.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk says China's new trade restrictions on rare earth magnets have affected the production of the company's Optimus humanoid robots, which rely on the exports. 

Speaking on a Tesla earnings call on Tuesday, Musk said that the company was working through the issue with Beijing and hoped to get approval to access the critical resources.

China, earlier this month, imposed new export controls on seven rare earth elements and magnets used in everything from defense to energy to automotive technologies. The move was in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's escalating tariffs.

According to Musk, Beijing has asked Tesla to guarantee that the rare earth magnets under expert control will not be used for military purposes.

"China wants some assurances that these aren't used for military purposes, which obviously they're not. They're just going into a humanoid robot," he said.

The new restrictions, which have raised the risk of global shortages, require exporters of medium and heavy rare earths in question to receive licenses from China's Ministry of Commerce.

China dominates the market for many of these rare earths, with the U.S. unprepared to fill a potential shortfall, according to the Center for Strategic & International Studies. 

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has into potential new tariffs on all U.S. imports of critical minerals in response to China's export controls. 

During the earnings call on Tuesday, Musk emphasized the importance of humanoid robots to the company's future plans. 

"The future of the company is fundamentally based upon large scale autonomous cars and large scale, large volume and vast numbers of autonomous humanoid robots," he said. 

Previously, Musk had announced plans for Optimus to produce about 5,000 units this year as the technology grows as part of Tesla's future business plans. Moreover, he said that Tesla would deploy the robots in its EV factories. 

It's unclear to what extent export controls might alter these plans. However, Musk reassured investors on Tuesday that the company still plans to produce thousands of robots this year, with thousands also expected to be deployed at Tesla factories.

The emerging technology could help Tesla drive some investor optimism as its EV business struggles, with its stock down about 37% year-to-date.

Steve Westly, founder and managing partner of The Westly Group and former Tesla Board member, told CNBC's 'Closing Bell Overtime' on Tuesday that the company needs to find a new growth engine soon. 

The company is expected to face stiff competition from other humanoid robot players in China, such as Unitree Robotics and AgiBot, both of which reportedly plan to enter mass production this year. The export controls could give the Chinese players another advantage over their U.S. competitors, according to some analysts.

While Musk is upbeat about Tesla's prospects in the space, going so far as to claim that it is ahead of the competition, he is concerned that the leaderboard will be filled with Chinese companies.

Monday - Friday, 10:00 - 11:00 SIN/HK  |  0400 - 05:00 CET

This report is from this week's edition of CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. Each week, we'll explore the biggest business stories in China, give a lowdown on market moves and help you set up for the week ahead. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.

Increased regulatory scrutiny of U.S.-listed Chinese firms has stoked delisting worries, threatening the decade-plus run of Alibaba and other Chinese companies on U.S. exchanges.

A broad "everything is on the table" comment from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on April 9 has reignited fears on Wall Street that hundreds of billions of dollars may flow out in a forced delisting of Chinese stocks from U.S. exchanges.

Thanks to the latest version of a law made in 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission can prompt a Chinese stock delisting if the company is deemed noncompliant with audit requests for two straight years. Paul Atkins, sworn on Monday as SEC chairman, indicated during a hearing last month that he would uphold that process for scrutinizing U.S.-listed Chinese stocks.

The continuing analyst and press coverage of Bessent's comments reflects how uncertainty is broadening out — even warranting a related piece in the New York Post tabloid.

"In an extreme scenario, U.S. investors may have to liquidate US$800bn worth of holdings in Chinese stocks if they are banned from investing in Chinese securities," Goldman Sachs said in a note last week.

They predicted Chinese investors might also need to sell their U.S. financial assets, with an estimated worth of roughly $370 billion in stocks and $1.3 trillion in bonds.

KraneShares, which runs a popular $5.9 billion U.S. exchange-traded fund tracking Chinese stocks, told its clients last week that delisting of Chinese companies was a "low probability." Back during an earlier round of delisting fears in 2022, the company started shifting the bulk of its KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB) holdings to the Hong Kong-traded shares of U.S.-listed Chinese companies. KraneShares reiterated taking that approach in the "unlikely event" that Chinese companies are delisted in the U.S.

Alibaba listed additional shares in Hong Kong in 2019, five years after a massive initial public offering in New York. While Baidu, JD.com and several other Chinese companies have also offered shares in Hong Kong in recent years, Temu parent PDD Holdings notably has yet to do so.

PDD did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. The e-commerce company moved its headquarters from China to Ireland in 2023.

The backdrop here is U.S. President Donald Trump's "America First Investment Policy" memo published in late February. It called for a review of U.S. investments in Chinese entities, as well as renewed scrutiny of publicly traded Chinese companies — both through commonly used listing structures and through the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act that became law in 2020.

The memo is a broad mandate for many government agencies, including the SEC, "to enforce existing rules and create new rules" relating to U.S.-listed Chinese companies, said Winston Ma, adjunct professor at NYU School of Law. 

Ma, author of "The Digital War: How China's Tech Power Shapes the Future of AI, Blockchain and Cyberspace," said that if regulators act now, they could use a fiscal reporting period ending April 2025 as year one, meaning that year two would end in 2026, fulfilling the "two year" compliance period necessary for delisting. "Delisting could come faster than you think," he said.

The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which falls under the SEC's oversight, said in 2022 that it was able to inspect audit records of potentially affected Chinese companies. For now, "there are no issuers at risk of having their securities subject to a trading prohibition" under the law, according to the SEC website.

The SEC did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment, while the PCAOB declined to comment.

The House Select Committee on China late last week sent letters to JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan demanding the investment banks pull out from underwriting the Hong Kong IPO of Chinese battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology. JPMorgan declined to comment, while Bank of America did not respond.

Trump's recent spat with Harvard also means more scrutiny on how U.S. universities' endowment funds have made billions from their Chinese investments.

The House committee previously cited research from U.S. advocacy group Future Union on how U.S. pension funds and university endowments have invested in China.

"Atkins is under pressure to take an assertive stand against decades of duplicitous double standards," Future Union Executive Director Andrew King said in an email. He is also managing partner at San Francisco-based venture capital firm Bastille.

"The delisting is overdue, and China overplayed its hand by stonewalling regulators and flaunting cases like Luckin Coffee fraud with inaction," he said. "Now they are going to lose their path to secondary funding without oversight."

China's securities regulator has sought to increase its oversight of domestic companies listing overseas, especially following ride-hailing company Didi's U.S. IPO in 2021 and its subsequent delisting. Under the Chinese securities regulator's new process, few large Chinese companies have been able to list in the U.S. in recent months, including Chinese milk tea company Chagee just last week.

As the protracted delay over a legally binding TikTok divestiture has shown, the worries over delisting could be exaggerated — at least in the near term. Investors, however, may choose to vote with their feet first.

Impact of U.S.-China trade war "immaterial": Xpeng Vice Chairman

Brian Gu, vice chairman of Xpeng, talks about how the Chinese EV maker is weathering a volatile global trade environment: from building its AI chips in-house, to finding "tremendous potential" in key foreign markets in Europe and Southeast Asia.

"Everyone is very pessimistic": Shenzhen Cross-Border E-commerce Association

The Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association represents thousands of Chinese businesses that sell worldwide, including on Amazon. The group's head, Xin Wang, tells CNBC that customers are still buying these goods – but both buyers and sellers are building up their presences in other markets.

Mercedes-Benz CEO on the impact of auto tariffs, unveiling the new CLA and U.S. production 

CNBC's Phil LeBeau and Mercedes-Benz CEO Dimitris Psillakis join "Closing Bell" to discuss the impact of auto tariffs, unveiling of the new CLA offering.

The White House is signaling a potential easing in China tensions. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told investors Tuesday he expected the U.S.-China trade war to de-escalate in the "very near future," a person in the room told CNBC. The comments came a day after China vowed retaliation against countries that follow U.S. calls to isolate Beijing.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang visited China and met several prominent figures. Huang had an official meeting with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Beijing Thursday— and reportedly DeepSeek's Liang Wenfeng. The latest Pew Research survey of Americans found a softening in negative views on China.

Local governments in China mull bitcoin sales to shore up empty coffers. That consideration was reported by Reuters on Thursday. China has banned cryptocurrencies for years, and cash-strapped local authorities have been sitting on the seized assets. Unemployment among Chinese youths aged 16 to 24 fell in March to 16.5%, down from 16.9% in February, according to official data.

Chinese and Hong Kong stocks were trading in positive territory Wednesday as investors cheered the potential easing of U.S.-China trade tensions.

Mainland China's CSI 300 rose 0.15% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index — which includes several major Chinese companies — climbed 2.16% as of 11:00 a.m. local time.

Since the start of this year, the CSI 300 has lost 3.7% while the Hang Seng Index has risen 9.67%.

The benchmark 10-year Chinese government bond yield edged up slightly to 1.660%.

The offshore Chinese yuan strengthened marginally to 7.3049 against the greenback.

Key Points

Investors continued to buy risk assets on Wednesday, including growth stocks, tech stocks, and cryptocurrencies, following a sharp move higher on Tuesday. And as highly correlated assets, it's no surprise they're all up in unison today.

The move in crypto is largely because of macroeconomic news, rather than anything about crypto itself. Bitcoin (BTC 2.79%) is up 2.9% since the stock market closed yesterday, Ethereum (ETH 5.70%) is up 5.1%, and Dogecoin (DOGE 4.11%) is up 6.2%.

The speculation today is that tariffs on imports from China will come down in short order after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expects a "de-escalation" in the trade war with China in the "very near future." 

It's the trade war that has caused concern that the U.S. will go into a recession, and that has caused a decline in Bitcoin and the market overall. But some of those concerns were alleviated today, at least according to the market's moves. 

If the trade war is indeed easing and the economy picks up later this year, it could be good for markets, including cryptocurrencies. But that continues to be uncertain given all that's happened in the past month.

What's notable about Bitcoin's move today is that it's correlated with growth and tech stocks, not a hedge against them. Gold, for contrast, is down 3.3% today and was up late last week and early this week when markets were crashing.

Bitcoin itself doesn't appear to be an inflation hedge, market hedge, or a store of value in volatile markets. It's acting like a risk asset, and that's how investors should expect it to trade.

While Bitcoin has become a clear risk asset, Ethereum and Dogecoin have more questions around them as the market determines where crypto assets are going long term. Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin by a wide margin despite more utility for the blockchain built over the last few years. That's because Ethereum hasn't improved its speed or cost of transactions, as blockchains like Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) take market share because of their speed and low costs.

Dogecoin was the first meme coin, but buying memes is only fun when the market is going up. Dogecoin is down over 50% since post-election highs and is still well below 2021 highs hit during the peak of the market frenzy. Dogecoin will continue to trade like a risk asset, but it's hard to see its fundamentals improving without a real use case for the token.

I see moves like today's as another sign that the crypto market will continue to be extremely volatile and trade along with assets like growth stocks. But unlike growth stocks, there's less fundamental value behind these tokens.

Bitcoin's argument for being a store of value hasn't proven to be true after falling after tariffs were announced earlier this month. And if inflation spikes, we will likely see Bitcoin fall again.

Ethereum and Dogecoin continue to have mind share, but as developers and businesses are looking for more use cases for the blockchain they may lose favor. Today's move looks like a temporary bounce for Ethereum's and Dogecoin's declining fortunes long term.

Kyle Kemper, half-brother of former prime minister Justin Trudeau, is warning Canadians that Liberal Leader Mark Carney would push for a national central bank digital currency (CBDC).

In a video shared on Twitter/X on Wednesday, Kemper brands Carney “the CBDC candidate” and claims the former central banker is acting for elite groups such as the Bilderberg Group and World Economic Forum. 

Kemper tells viewers a digital loonie would be “fully tracked, fully centralized” and could reward citizens for obedience while punishing dissent.

“People don't understand how dangerous a CBDC is,” said Kemper.

Kemper pointed out that President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order banning an American CBDC and argues Canada should do the same.

Kemper has been warning Canada about Carney, including telling the Western Standard that Carney's policies are the exact opposite of what Canada needs, particularly Carney's economic policies.

Carney, sworn in as Liberal leader last month, has not responded publicly to Kemper's remarks. 

On the campaign trail this week, Carney emphasized the need for a modern payments system but has stopped short of committing to a timeline for any digital dollar.

Central bank digital currencies are being tested or studied in more than 100 countries, including China and the European Union. 

The Bank of Canada continues internal research but says no decision will be made without public consultation and parliamentary approval.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has promised to block a CBDC if his party wins the federal election, saying it would give Ottawa too much control over personal finances.  

The CBDC issue adds a crypto controversy to an already volatile campaign defined by trade tensions and energy security.

 Cointelegraph speaks with James Check on why Bitcoin's future lies beyond four-year cycles, and how onchain data reveals what really matters. 

For years, crypto investors have looked to the four-year cycle, anchored around Bitcoin's halving events, as a kind of sacred roadmap. The theory goes: Every four years, Bitcoin's supply is cut in half, triggering a bullish frenzy, followed by a euphoric peak, a brutal crash, and then a slow recovery. Rinse, repeat.

But what if that model is starting to break? That is what onchain analyst James Check suggests. 

In an interview with Cointelegraph, Check said that the tidy frameworks that once defined Bitcoin's market behavior are no longer as useful in today's macro-driven, institutionally influenced environment.

Rather than labeling the current market as “bull” or “bear,” Check paints a more nuanced picture. Bitcoin, he argues, is now driven more by macroeconomic conditions and investor psychology than by predictable cycles or halving dates. As such, the lines between bull and bear get blurry.

“The world doesn't operate on four-year cycles,” he says. “You can imagine a headline tomorrow where suddenly all these tariffs get pulled back […] and markets start to move. I can just as easily construct a case where the next headline could send all risk assets into a pretty nasty decline.”

Check also breaks down why the $70K–$75K range is such a critical confidence zone for the Bitcoin market — and how thinking in terms of scenarios rather than predictions is key for an investor's long-term success.

Nearly $4 million in stolen cargo was   recovered by police in a case involving a South American crime ring  that looted coffee, tequila, shoes, body wash, pet food and bitcoin-mining computers.

Police arrested Oscar David Borrero-Manchola, 41, and Yonaiker Rafael Martinez-Ramos, 26,  in the theft, sale and movement of stolen cargo, the Los Angeles Police Department announced in a news release. 

Roughly $1.2 million worth of stolen goods was  found in storage unit facilities in the San Fernando Valley, where police found speakers, clothing and other items. Detectives were also able to intercept a shipment of stolen bitcoin-mining computers that was set to be loaded onto a plane bound for Hong Kong. 

The stolen computers were valued at $2.7 million, police said.

The investigation included various search warrants and other detective work from the Los Angeles Police Department's cargo theft unit, which worked with the Los Angeles Port Police, Union Pacific Police Department and Los Angeles World Airport Police.

Crews of thieves who travel from Chile and other South American nations for the purpose of stealing jewels and luxury goods are not new in Los Angeles, authorities say, but such heists “are way, way up.”

Borrero-Manchola was arrested April 15 and booked into a Van Nuys jail on suspicion of receiving stolen property. He was released on his own recognizance the following day, according to jail records. He's due to appear in court  May 7.

Martinez-Ramos was arrested Sunday on a no-bail warrant by Glendale police. He's  in custody at Men's Central Jail and due to appear in court  Thursday.

The investigation remains active and more arrests could be announced, police said.

South American theft groups, also called burglary tourists, have arrived in the country on tourist visas and then targeted wealthy enclaves across California in recent years, according to law enforcement.

Four Colombian men were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary in May 2024 after a high-speed pursuit. One of the suspects allegedly threw out a Wi-Fi jammer during the pursuit, an electronic device used to disrupt home security cameras. 

In February, seven Chileans were charged with conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property after they allegedly broke in and stole valuables worth more than $2 million from the homes of professional athletes.

Is the latest rally enough to shift Ethereum price prediction, or do lingering dominance lows and macro risk still cap how far ETH can realistically go?

After several weeks of sluggish price action, Ethereum (ETH) is finally showing signs of a meaningful recovery. The second-largest crypto by market cap recently climbed past $1,800, staging a sharp rebound from its Apr. 9 low, when it briefly dipped below $1,400.

That earlier drop was partly triggered by market unease over President Trump's tariff-driven economic stance, which had weighed on risk assets.

Since then, ETH has rallied more than 26%, breaking decisively out of the narrow $1,500 to $1,600 range where it had remained stuck for much of the month. As of April 23, Ethereum is trading near $1,790, gaining over 10% in just the past 24 hours.

The broader crypto market is also turning more optimistic, with Bitcoin (BTC) trading close to $92,500 and the total market cap nearing the $3 trillion mark.

On-chain data reflects a return of deep-pocketed players. One whale recently borrowed $34.75 million in Tether (USDT) from Aave (AAVE) and used those funds to purchase nearly 20,000 ETH at an average entry of $1,740.

As $ETH rebounded, a whale borrowed 34.75M $USDT from #Aave to buy 19,973 $ETH at ~$1,740 just 4 hours ago.This whale now collateralizes 50K $WETH ($89.8M) on #Aave to borrow 65.85M $USDT at a health rate of 1.12 and a liquidation price of $1,549.5.Follow @spotonchain and… pic.twitter.com/OBaDukqfAm

The same entity has now deposited 50,000 Wrapped Ethereum (WETH), valued at approximately $89.8 million, as collateral to borrow over $65 million more. 

The liquidation threshold for this position sits around $1,549, suggesting a carefully hedged bet built on short- to medium-term conviction.

Institutional signals are beginning to follow. On April 22, U.S.-listed Ethereum ETFs saw net inflows of $38.74 million, breaking a 10-day streak of flat or negative flows. Fidelity's FETH led the activity with $32.65 million in inflows, followed by Bitwise's ETHW with $6.09 million. 

These inflows marked the highest single-day intake for Ethereum funds since early February and came after eight straight weeks of persistent outflows, which had totaled nearly $910 million. In total, Ethereum-focused ETFs have now accumulated approximately $2.26 billion in inflows since their respective launches.

With both market structure and institutional behavior beginning to shift, let's examine what's happening across Ethereum's ecosystem, and where Ethereum price prediction could head in the coming days.

Ethereum's technical foundations may soon undergo a profound transformation, following a new proposal by co-founder Vitalik Buterin.

On Apr. 20, Buterin introduced the idea of replacing the Ethereum Virtual Machine with RISC-V, an open-source computing architecture known for its modularity and built-in encryption support.

The EVM has long served as the backbone of Ethereum's smart contract functionality. It enables developers to deploy decentralized applications and has been central to Ethereum's broad compatibility with other blockchains and layer-2 networks. 

Popular ecosystems such as Coinbase's Base chain rely heavily on EVM standards to enable cross-chain operations and support developer migration.

Buterin's proposal suggests that switching to RISC-V could streamline Ethereum's execution layer—the part of the network that processes and executes smart contract code.

While the EVM has proven reliable, it is increasingly seen as a bottleneck for Ethereum's scalability. Adopting a more modern and adaptable architecture like RISC-V, according to Buterin, could enhance processing efficiency and reduce resource demands on the network.

One of RISC-V's key strengths lies in its native support for encryption functions. This allows Ethereum to potentially avoid the complexity of ongoing efforts to reconfigure the EVM around zero-knowledge proofs. 

While zero-knowledge systems promise enhanced privacy and scalability, they often require significant computational power and development overhead. RISC-V's built-in capabilities may offer a more direct and lightweight alternative.

Buterin also pointed out that RISC-V has already shown promise in other blockchain environments, including small-scale implementations on platforms like Polkadot (DOT). 

In certain use cases, performance could improve by more than a hundredfold if Ethereum were to integrate RISC-V at the protocol level. These gains could help address persistent concerns over gas fees and network congestion, both of which remain barriers to everyday use and mainstream adoption.

The proposal comes at a crucial moment. Ethereum's transaction volumes have declined, and ETH's price performance has lagged behind broader market trends. Earlier this year, the Ethereum Foundation underwent a leadership change aimed at reorienting the project's strategic direction. 

Ethereum's recent price recovery is beginning to attract attention, but the rally remains in a fragile phase from a technical perspective. At the time of writing, ETH is trading just under the $1,800 mark, marking a steady climb from earlier lows.

Despite this rebound, Ethereum is still trading below key long-term resistance levels. The 50-day simple moving average stands at $1,830, while the 100-day sits much higher at $2,342. Both remain above the current price, signaling that ETH has yet to fully exit its broader downtrend and reclaim upward momentum on a longer time frame.

On the short-term side, ETH is showing healthier signals. The 5-day and 10-day moving averages have moved to $1,709 and $1,660, both now sitting below the current price, a typical early indicator of a bullish shift. 

The Relative Strength Index is hovering near 56.5, reflecting neutral territory, not yet in overbought or oversold conditions. This suggests there's still room for further price movement in either direction without immediate exhaustion.

Momentum indicators remain more cautious. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), currently at 38, signals a neutral trend. It does not yet point to a strong directional shift, implying that market participants are still weighing macro cues and short-term signals.

Support levels are holding firm at $1,623, $1,490, and $1,422. These price points provide a safety net if the market sees a near-term correction. On the upside, resistance lies at $1,824, followed by $1,892 and $2,025. 

These thresholds will likely serve as key decision points for traders looking to determine whether the current move has lasting strength or is merely a temporary relief rally. A sustained breakout above the $1,900 level would be a clearer signal of broader market confidence returning.

Ethereum's recent bounce has sparked a wave of optimism, with several analysts suggesting that the recovery may finally be gaining structure.

A pseudonymous analyst named Incognito, posting on TradingView, sees a classic setup forming a “falling wedge” pattern, which often precedes a bullish breakout. 

According to him, Ethereum looks like it's nearing the final stages of a Wyckoff accumulation phase, a framework used to map how assets transition from sell-offs to new uptrends. 

If that plays out, his chart suggests an initial move toward $2,499, and possibly as high as $2,700. A similar note came from trader Christiaan on X, who shared a near-term target of $2,690.

Both analysts are optimistic that Ethereum may be ready to climb, but only if short-term support stays intact. Any dip back into the previous range could invalidate the setup altogether.

Meanwhile, Rekt Capital is approaching it from a broader lens, not price, but dominance. ETH dominance, which tracks Ethereum's market cap relative to the rest of crypto, recently hit new lows. But it's still holding above its 2019 base, and that matters.

$ETH DominanceSince dropped to new All Time Lows, Ethereum Dominance has managed to protect 2019 All Time Lows as support (black) for nowETH Dominance needs to Monthly Close inside green so as to develop a reversal base like back in 2019-2020#ETH #Crypto #Ethereum https://t.co/Ubh8iDpx6j pic.twitter.com/3DXw4udWa2

According to him, if Ethereum can close the month inside the green support band on his chart, it could be repeating the kind of bottom formation that led to the multi-month rally between 2019 and 2020.

Another angle comes from Michaël van de Poppe, who sees a bullish divergence starting to take shape. That's when price prints lower lows but momentum indicators like RSI show higher lows—often a subtle clue that selling pressure is fading.

A clear bullish divergence on $ETH signalling there's more to come.It breaks back in the lower timeframe range, indicating that we're having more in the tank.Level to hold: 1850 sats.If that holds and $ETH prints HLs, it's likely that we'll start an uptrend. pic.twitter.com/1dQJvqEUy2

Van de Poppe added that if Ethereum holds 1,850 sats against Bitcoin and starts to form higher lows, there's a good chance it could enter a fresh uptrend from here.

Still, these are signals, not certainties. Technical analysis can help identify potential shifts in sentiment, but charts don't account for sudden macro shocks.

As always, risk management matters. Whether ETH pushes higher or stalls again will depend on how the market handles upcoming resistance zones and whether confidence builds fast enough to carry it through. Trade wisely, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Cantor Fitzgerald, a leading global financial services firm, is partnering with SoftBank, Tether, and Bitfinex to build a Bitcoin acquisition vehicle. The new venture will be called 21 Capital and is expected to raise $3B worth of Bitcoin from its partners – $1.5M from Tether, $900M from SoftBank, and $600M from Bitfinex. 

21 Capital looks to follow MicroStrategy's investing path, which saw a surge in market cap (all the way up to $91B) after shifting to Bitcoin.

Read on as we explore the details of this deal and what it could mean for the broader crypto market. We'll also suggest three of the best altcoins you can buy to ride $BTC's potential rally.

More About the Deal: Could it Help Push Bitcoin Above $100K?

Cantor's partners are scheduled to convert their $BTC investments (1 $BTC at $85K) into 21 Capital shares, which will each have a face value of $10.

The deal is still in its early stages, though, and there has been no official announcement yet. It's quite possible that the arrangement falls through or the terms change for the final deal. It's also worth noting that this isn't the first time Cantor has forayed into crypto. In November 2024, after the appointment of Trump as the president, plans emerged about a $BTC lending program with Tether that would allow people to borrow money with $BTC as collateral. 

Ever since Howard Lutnick stepped down from Cantor to join Trump's Commerce Department, the firm has been headed by Brandon and Kyle Lutnick (his sons) as Chairman and Executive VC.

The credit for a shift towards a more pro-crypto mindset goes to the ‘crypto president,' who has promised to make crypto mainstream in the US through positive regulations.

Bitcoin Hits New 7-Week High

For the first time since March 2, 2025, Bitcoin has breached the $93K level after it rose by more than 6.8% on Tuesday, April 22.

The king crypto jumped 1.56% within just one minute during this rally, from $91,969 to $93,405.



Michael Sullivan, a Bitcoin analyst, said, ‘This is the craziest one-minute candle I've ever seen on the Bitcoin chart.' Just a day earlier, more than $381.3M inflow was seen in the 11 US spot $BTC ETFs as well. Another analyst, ‘Ted,' believes that $BTC will eventually catch up with gold, which hit fresh lifetime highs only a few days ago. 

This comes after Trump said that the tariffs on China will eventually come down significantly and that he won't be removing Powell, the US Federal Reserve Chair.

With institutional momentum building – and Bitcoin hitting new highs on the back of deals like Cantor's 21 Capital – the stage is set for another full-scale bull run. And while $BTC might be the headliner, it's often the altcoins riding its wave that deliver the biggest returns.

That's why now is the time to explore three of the best low-cap coins to buy today if you're looking to ride the next phase of Bitcoin's rally.

1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Altcoin to Buy to Ride $BTC's Growth

If you're looking for a meme coin that can mimic (and even surpass) Bitcoin's growth trajectory without requiring a huge upfront investment, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is the best crypto to buy now. Especially as $BTCBULL is the ONLY crypto that airdrops free $BTC to its token holders.

Moreover, because these airdrops will take place every time Bitcoin smashes through a new milestone (like $150K, $200K, and $250K), we can expect BTC Bull Token to follow Bitcoin's coattails.



What's more, the project's developers have planned to follow a deflationary approach, which will further push $BTCBULL's price. Essentially, a part of the total $BTCBULL supply will be wiped off every time Bitcoin climbs up by another $25K in price. This creates artificial scarcity for the token, which, combined with rising $BTC prices, could inflate $BTCBULL's demand – and lastly, its price. 

To better understand BTC Bull Token's potential, take a look at our $BTCBULL price prediction. It suggests that the token could explode by nearly 400% and reach $0.0096 by 2026.

Don't miss out on Bitcoin's biggest cheerleader and buy $BTCBULL today! Even better, each token is priced at just $0.002475, seeing as the project is in presale (where it has raised nearly $5M).

2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Top New Altcoin Building First-Ever Solana L2

A Bitcoin rally would add further fuel to the recent resurgence of meme coins. Consequently, this would make Solana, i.e., the go-to blockchain for meme coins, the center of attraction.

As a result, Solana's most anticipated listing, Solaxy ($SOLX), which aims to solve the network's congestion and scalability issues, could become the next crypto to explode.



To achieve its lofty goal of revamping Solana, Solaxy will build the first-ever Layer-2 scaling protocol on the network. This will shoulder the burden on Solana's mainnet by offloading some of its transactions onto a sidechain. Furthermore, since $SOLX is compatible with both Ethereum and Solana (it's a multi-chain token), it will leverage the former's liquidity and the latter's speed to bring about the ultimate Solana revolution. 

One of the biggest reasons we've predicted Solaxy to gain over 12,000% and reach $0.20 by 2030 is its presale performance. With over $31M in presale funding, it's easily among the best crypto presales we've seen in recent times.

The presale is still on. You can get one token for just $0.001702. Check out our guide on how to buy Solaxy for more information.

3. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) – Best PolitiFi Altcoin to Get Right Now

Much of crypto's newfound life is down to the pro-crypto attitude of the newly appointed US president, Mr. Donald Trump.

Therefore, it's not only fair but also highly likely that his own meme coin, $TRUMP, is one of the biggest beneficiaries of a Bitcoin buying spree. There are early signs, too. $TRUMP is up over 17% in the last seven days, hinting at a reversal of sorts.



The token is currently priced at just $9.40, with recent price action suggesting that a long rally might be in store.

It's worth noting that $TRUMP's launch in January was one of the most monumental moments in crypto history, so it's not just any meme coin – it's a piece of history.

$TRUMP shot up by more than 12,000% overnight and became the fourth biggest meme coin by market capitalization in virtually seconds after its launch.

DYOR Before Buying the Best Altcoins

Investing in $BTC directly is admittedly the safest way to dip your toes in crypto. After all, there's a much higher likelihood that the king cryptocurrency will be trading higher in five years' time.

However, the same isn't true for even the best altcoins. Because of their high volatility (which is what gives them exploding potential, too, by the way), they can cause significant losses.

That's why we urge our readers to do their own research before investing. It'd also be sound if you only invested an amount you're comfortable losing.

The deal is still in its early stages, though, and there has been no official announcement yet. It's quite possible that the arrangement falls through or the terms change for the final deal. It's also worth noting that this isn't the first time Cantor has forayed into crypto. In November 2024, after the appointment of Trump as the president, plans emerged about a $BTC lending program with Tether that would allow people to borrow money with $BTC as collateral. 

Ever since Howard Lutnick stepped down from Cantor to join Trump's Commerce Department, the firm has been headed by Brandon and Kyle Lutnick (his sons) as Chairman and Executive VC.

The credit for a shift towards a more pro-crypto mindset goes to the ‘crypto president,' who has promised to make crypto mainstream in the US through positive regulations.

Bitcoin Hits New 7-Week High

For the first time since March 2, 2025, Bitcoin has breached the $93K level after it rose by more than 6.8% on Tuesday, April 22.

The king crypto jumped 1.56% within just one minute during this rally, from $91,969 to $93,405.



Michael Sullivan, a Bitcoin analyst, said, ‘This is the craziest one-minute candle I've ever seen on the Bitcoin chart.' Just a day earlier, more than $381.3M inflow was seen in the 11 US spot $BTC ETFs as well. Another analyst, ‘Ted,' believes that $BTC will eventually catch up with gold, which hit fresh lifetime highs only a few days ago. 

This comes after Trump said that the tariffs on China will eventually come down significantly and that he won't be removing Powell, the US Federal Reserve Chair.

With institutional momentum building – and Bitcoin hitting new highs on the back of deals like Cantor's 21 Capital – the stage is set for another full-scale bull run. And while $BTC might be the headliner, it's often the altcoins riding its wave that deliver the biggest returns.

That's why now is the time to explore three of the best low-cap coins to buy today if you're looking to ride the next phase of Bitcoin's rally.

1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Altcoin to Buy to Ride $BTC's Growth

If you're looking for a meme coin that can mimic (and even surpass) Bitcoin's growth trajectory without requiring a huge upfront investment, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is the best crypto to buy now. Especially as $BTCBULL is the ONLY crypto that airdrops free $BTC to its token holders.

Moreover, because these airdrops will take place every time Bitcoin smashes through a new milestone (like $150K, $200K, and $250K), we can expect BTC Bull Token to follow Bitcoin's coattails.



What's more, the project's developers have planned to follow a deflationary approach, which will further push $BTCBULL's price. Essentially, a part of the total $BTCBULL supply will be wiped off every time Bitcoin climbs up by another $25K in price. This creates artificial scarcity for the token, which, combined with rising $BTC prices, could inflate $BTCBULL's demand – and lastly, its price. 

To better understand BTC Bull Token's potential, take a look at our $BTCBULL price prediction. It suggests that the token could explode by nearly 400% and reach $0.0096 by 2026.

Don't miss out on Bitcoin's biggest cheerleader and buy $BTCBULL today! Even better, each token is priced at just $0.002475, seeing as the project is in presale (where it has raised nearly $5M).

2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Top New Altcoin Building First-Ever Solana L2

A Bitcoin rally would add further fuel to the recent resurgence of meme coins. Consequently, this would make Solana, i.e., the go-to blockchain for meme coins, the center of attraction.

As a result, Solana's most anticipated listing, Solaxy ($SOLX), which aims to solve the network's congestion and scalability issues, could become the next crypto to explode.



To achieve its lofty goal of revamping Solana, Solaxy will build the first-ever Layer-2 scaling protocol on the network. This will shoulder the burden on Solana's mainnet by offloading some of its transactions onto a sidechain. Furthermore, since $SOLX is compatible with both Ethereum and Solana (it's a multi-chain token), it will leverage the former's liquidity and the latter's speed to bring about the ultimate Solana revolution. 

One of the biggest reasons we've predicted Solaxy to gain over 12,000% and reach $0.20 by 2030 is its presale performance. With over $31M in presale funding, it's easily among the best crypto presales we've seen in recent times.

The presale is still on. You can get one token for just $0.001702. Check out our guide on how to buy Solaxy for more information.

3. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) – Best PolitiFi Altcoin to Get Right Now

Much of crypto's newfound life is down to the pro-crypto attitude of the newly appointed US president, Mr. Donald Trump.

Therefore, it's not only fair but also highly likely that his own meme coin, $TRUMP, is one of the biggest beneficiaries of a Bitcoin buying spree. There are early signs, too. $TRUMP is up over 17% in the last seven days, hinting at a reversal of sorts.



The token is currently priced at just $9.40, with recent price action suggesting that a long rally might be in store.

It's worth noting that $TRUMP's launch in January was one of the most monumental moments in crypto history, so it's not just any meme coin – it's a piece of history.

$TRUMP shot up by more than 12,000% overnight and became the fourth biggest meme coin by market capitalization in virtually seconds after its launch.

DYOR Before Buying the Best Altcoins

Investing in $BTC directly is admittedly the safest way to dip your toes in crypto. After all, there's a much higher likelihood that the king cryptocurrency will be trading higher in five years' time.

However, the same isn't true for even the best altcoins. Because of their high volatility (which is what gives them exploding potential, too, by the way), they can cause significant losses.

That's why we urge our readers to do their own research before investing. It'd also be sound if you only invested an amount you're comfortable losing.

This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

Bitcoin (BTC) has finally surpassed a key resistance that limited recovery rallies earlier this year, after rising over 5% to $93,500 in 24 hours.

The leading digital asset by market value has topped the "Ichimoku Cloud," confirming a bullish shift in momentum, while other major cryptocurrencies lag.

The Ichimoku cloud, developed by a Japanese journalist in the 1960s, is used to identify support and resistance, momentum, and trend change in price actions. The indicator comprises five lines: Leading Span A, Leading Span B, and the gap between the two representing the cloud, Conversion Line or Tenkan-Sen (T), Base Line or Kijun-Sen (K), and a lagging closing price line.

Crossovers above and below the cloud represent bullish and bearish shifts in the market trend, and BTC has moved above the cloud, as seen in the chart below.

The bullish breakout means the cloud can now act as support, arresting potential price pullbacks just as it acted as resistance, capping recovery rallies in February and March. BTC is also back to trading above the widely tracked 50-, 100-, and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs).

This move now puts the focus on the resistance at $100K, a major psychological level, followed by record highs above $109K. Meanwhile, support is seen at $88,550, which marks the convergence of the 200-day SMA and the Ichimoku cloud. 

A move below the same would negate the bullish outlook.

Major altcoins such as payments-focused XRP, leading meme token DOGE, Cardano's ADA, Ethereum's native token ETH, and Solana's SOL are yet to chart a BTC-like bullish breakout above the Ichimoku cloud.

The above coins, though buoyant alongside BTC's ascent, have yet to make their respective bullish breakouts.

Crypto firm Galaxy Digital is executing an asset swap involving the native tokens of layer-1 blockchains Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), according to on-chain data.

Data from blockchain tracking platform Lookonchain suggests that Galaxy Digital has, over the past two weeks, sold Ethereum worth tens of millions of dollars and purchased Solana.

“In the past two weeks, Galaxy Digital deposited 65,600 ETH ($105.48 million) to Binance and withdrew 752,240 SOL ($98.37 million) from Binance.”

Galaxy Digital's portfolio reorganization is coming amid the firm's head of research, Alex Thorn, predicting that the US will purchase Bitcoin (BTC) this year to add to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) launched in March. According to Thorn, one of the options the US could exercise to purchase the flagship crypto asset in a budget-neutral way would be to swap confiscated altcoins into Bitcoin.

“To be specific, you could sell an altcoin in an altcoin/BTC pair and never touch cash at all. No cash ever has to flow into the [US] general treasury. Could be an easier way to get to a ‘promises made, promises kept' on the SBR.”

Ethereum is trading at $1,630 at time of writing, down by 67% from the all-time high reached in November of 2021. Solana is changing hands at $140 at time of writing, down by 52% from the record high hit in January.

Bitcoin (BTC) miner Riot Platforms (RIOT) has struck a $100 million credit agreement with Coinbase's credit arm, using bitcoin as collateral to secure short-term funding for its ongoing expansion.

The publicly traded mining firm said in a press release it would draw on the facility over the next two months. The deal offers Riot, which currently holds 19,223 BTC worth over $1.8 billion, a line of credit that avoids issuing new shares.

“This credit facility is a key part of our efforts to diversify sources of financing to support our operations and strategic growth initiatives, with a view towards long-term stockholder value creation,” said CEO Jason Les in a statement.

The loan, issued by Coinbase Credit, comes with a variable interest rate: borrowers will pay at least 7.75% annually, calculated as the greater of 3.25% or the federal funds rate upper bound, plus 4.5%. The loan term is 364 days, though Riot may seek a one-year extension if Coinbase agrees to it.

The credit facility is secured by a portion of Riot's total bitcoin reserves. The firm said it will use the funds “to pursue key strategic initiatives and for general corporate purposes.”

Coinbase has been making other similar deals. Just last week, healthcare technology firm Semler Scientific (SMLR) announced it reached an agreement with Coinbase to borrow cash via a loan secured by its bitcoin holdings.

Hut 8 (HUT), another bitcoin miner, has also leveraged a bitcoin-backed credit facility with Coinbase in the past.

Tether, SoftBank Group, and Jack Mallers Launch Twenty One, a Bitcoin-native Company, Through a Business Combination With Cantor Equity Partners

Backed by Tether and SoftBank Group, Twenty One is expected to launch with over 42,000 Bitcoin and a mission to maximize Bitcoin Ownership Per Share

Co-founder Jack Mallers will lead Twenty One as CEO

Twenty One is expected to offer investors a singular vehicle for Bitcoin exposure, pro-Bitcoin advocacy, and Bitcoin-focused content and media with plans to explore future expansion into Bitcoin-native financial products.

AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Twenty One Capital, Inc. (“Twenty One” or “the Company”), a newly formed entity, today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement for a business combination with Cantor Equity Partners, Inc. (“CEP”) (Nasdaq: CEP) (the “Business Combination”), a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsored by an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald, a leading global financial services and real estate services holding company.


At the closing of the Business Combination, Twenty One will be majority-owned by Tether, co-founder of Twenty One and the world's largest stablecoin issuer, and Bitfinex, with significant minority ownership by SoftBank Group Corp. (“SoftBank Group”), one of the world's leading investment holding companies.




Twenty One and CEP have also entered into subscription agreements with investors to raise, at closing, $585 million of total additional capital consisting of (i) $385 million through convertible senior secured notes and (ii) $200 million through a common equity PIPE financing (the “PIPE Offerings”, and together with the Business Combination, the “Proposed Transactions”). The net proceeds from the PIPE Offerings, which will close contemporaneously with the Business Combination, will be used to purchase additional Bitcoin and for general corporate purposes. Twenty One expects to launch with more than 42,000 Bitcoin, which would make it the third-largest Bitcoin treasury in the world as of today.




A New Era: Measuring Success in Bitcoin



Twenty One is built to accumulate Bitcoin and grow ownership per share, not just track it.




As part of its launch, Twenty One will introduce two key performance metrics, to reflect its Bitcoin-denominated capital structure and Bitcoin-focused mindset.




Led by Seasoned Founder with Deep Bitcoin Expertise



Twenty One will be led by Co-Founder and CEO Jack Mallers, who has been instrumental in furthering Bitcoin's adoption by institutions, corporations, and governments worldwide, and will continue with his existing roles and responsibilities. As the Founder and CEO of Strike, he has built one of the world's leading digital payment providers on Bitcoin's Lightning Network, pioneering Bitcoin brokerage infrastructure and Bitcoin's integration into corporate balance sheets.




“Markets need reliable money to measure value and allocate capital efficiently," said Jack Mallers, Co-Founder and CEO of Twenty One. “We believe that Bitcoin is the answer, and Twenty One is how we bring that answer to public markets. Our mission is simple: to become the most successful company in Bitcoin, the most valuable financial opportunity of our time. We're not here to beat the market, we're here to build a new one. A public stock, built by Bitcoiners, for Bitcoiners."




“Bitcoin is one of the only truly decentralized, immutable, and censorship-resistant asset, and its role as the foundation of a new financial system is inevitable,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether. “With Jack at the helm, we are proud to support this effort to further Bitcoin's adoption and reinforce its role as the ultimate store of value. At Tether, we have always believed in supporting initiatives that strengthen Bitcoin's dominance and real-world utility. Twenty One will take a Bitcoin-first approach that aligns with our vision—prioritizing accumulation over speculation and building long-term value for those who understand what Bitcoin represents.”




Pioneering Bitcoin-native Financial Solutions



Twenty One is structured to be a day one Bitcoin-native company that will strategically allocate capital to increase Bitcoin per share. Twenty One intends to develop a corporate architecture capable of supporting financial products built with and on Bitcoin. This includes native lending models, capital market instruments, and future innovations that will replace legacy financial tools with Bitcoin-aligned alternatives. As a pro-Bitcoin advocate, Twenty One plans to produce original Bitcoin-focused content and media. This pure-play approach will offer investors access to a public company that combines Bitcoin exposure with an operating business building Bitcoin-native products and services.




“Cantor's relationships with innovative partners are key to unlocking unique opportunities, and we are proud of our role in this extraordinary collaboration between Tether, a foundation for today's digital asset ecosystem, and SoftBank, one of the world's preeminent investors,” said Brandon Lutnick, Chairman & CEO of Cantor Equity Partners, Inc. and Chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P. “With a visionary leader at the helm and backing from two renowned industry leaders, Twenty One is designed to help investors capture value from Bitcoin's growing global demand and increasing institutional adoption.”




Terms of the Transaction



Shares of Cantor Equity Partners will continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “CEP” until the closing of the Transaction. Twenty One will seek to trade after closing under the ticker symbol “XXI.”




The Board of Directors of each of Twenty One and CEP has unanimously approved the transaction. The transaction will require the approval of the shareholders of CEP and is subject to customary closing conditions.




The transaction values Twenty One at a pro-forma enterprise value of $3.6 billion, based on a Bitcoin spot price of $84,863.57 (a 10-day average CME CF BRRNY price) as of April 21, 2025. The transaction is expected to provide approximately $540 million in proceeds to Twenty One, including from a fully committed convertible senior secured notes PIPE of $385 million, convertible at $13.00 per share, a fully committed common equity PIPE of $200 million at $10.00 per share, and $100 million of cash held in the trust account of CEP, assuming no redemptions and prior to accounting for transaction expenses and interest accrued on the CEP trust account. Up to an additional $100 million of convertible senior secured notes may be purchased, at the investors' option (the “Convertible Notes Option”), within 30 days of the date hereof, which may generate additional proceeds.

These filings do or will identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.

Pump Fun co-founder Dylan Kerler has been linked to a number of shitcoin rugpulls that extracted $75,000 from unsuspecting investors when he was just 16.

WIRED reportedly discovered that a developer using Dylan Kerler's name launched eight coins in 2017. Two of these, eBitcoinCash and EthereumCash, reportedly made the developer $75,000 in Ether (ETH), worth $400,000 today.

The developer promoted these two coins in the BitcoinTalk forum, making numerous promises and generating enough interest to raise EthereumCash's value to £1.3 million.

However, WIRED reports that they began selling their EthereumCash holdings in secret, which coincided with an 88% drop in value. They used EtherDelta to sell, making 240 ETH, before dividing it across various wallets on centralized exchanges.  

Certik's chief security scientist said, “We strongly suspect that [EthereumCash] was used by the developer for a rug pull.”

Both coins were promoted by one person, using the accounts DOMAINBROKER and ninjagod.

In one instance, DOMAINBROKER shared a personal email address with the name Dylan Kerler, while ninjagod launched a thread that referred to Kerler as the developer of EthereumCash. 

This developer also claimed in a Telegram group that they're based in the UK city of Brighton. Pump Fun's co-founder is also listed on the electoral records as having an address in the area, and a Pump Fun entity uses this address in its corporate filings.

A coin called Equis that was promoted by ninjagod on BitcoinTalk also shares identical code to EthereumCash and was featured on a YouTube account using Dylan Kerlar's name.

Neither Pump Fun nor Kerler responded to WIRED's request for comment. Protos has reached out to Alon Cohen, Pump Fun's co-founder, for comment and will update this article if we hear anything back.

The non-fungible token (NFT) sector experienced explosive growth in 2021. Artists, investors, and collectors were all swept up in the frenzy. Yet, its meteoric rise was followed by a downturn, prompting questions about the sector's sustainability.

Alexander Salnikov, co-founder of Rarible, believes the market is not facing a collapse but rather a shift. In an exclusive interview with BeInCrypto, Salnikov offered his perspective on the state of NFTs in 2025 and their role moving forward.

The rise of NFTs, fueled by excitement and speculation, was inevitable for a market experiencing such rapid innovation. Nonetheless, like many emerging technologies, this early surge was followed by a correction. The hype gave way to the realities of market maturation and sustainability.

According to the latest report by DappRadar, the art NFT market saw an impressive surge in 2021, with trading volumes reaching $2.9 billion. However, by the first quarter of 2025, the trading volume was recorded at just $23.8 million, marking a 93% decline.

Similarly, the number of active traders peaked at a record high of 529,101 in 2022. Yet, this figure sharply declined by 96%, with just 19,575 active traders remaining by Q1 2025. 

A previous industry report from DappRadar revealed that the underwhelming performance wasn't just a trend in 2025. In fact, 2024 was one of the worst-performing years for the NFT market since 2020. In addition, BeInCrypto also reported on a study that revealed 98% of NFT projects launched in 2024 were essentially “dead.” 

Despite the decline, Rarible's Salnikov has maintained a positive outlook for the sector. He emphasized the importance of a clear purpose when it comes to NFTs. 

“Once upon a time, after the .com burst, the headlines rang that the internet was only a fad. But as more companies integrated the technology into everyday use cases, it became ingrained as a part of life,” he told BeInCrypto.

Salnikov argued that trust quickly diminishes when NFTs are viewed merely as speculative assets. In contrast, projects rooted in real community engagement or providing tangible utility offer clear value, making their worth easily understood. 

Meanwhile, rather than viewing the sector's decline as a collapse, the executive sees it as a market recalibration, with the focus shifting away from speculative hype toward projects with more sustainable value. 

“The speculative phase had its moment, but now we're watching NFTs evolve into actual infrastructure—tools creators use to build communities, products, and new digital economies,” he said.

Salnikov stressed that utility in the NFT space is no longer a distant concept—it is happening right now. Creators are using NFTs for membership, brands for loyalty programs, and games for player identity. 

He pointed to a growing convergence between the digital and physical worlds, with NFTs being tied to merchandise, events, and even real-world assets. Binance Research's April 2025 report further corroborates this trend. 

The report spotlighted several real-world partnerships, indicating interest in NFTs. Examples include Azuki's physical-backed NFT with Michael Lau, The Sandbox's Jurassic World collaboration, EGGRYPTO's anime characters with Eparida, and Sony's Soneium platform partnering with LINE to create Web3 mini-apps.

“The next wave of growth isn't about chasing a trend—it's about unlocking new types of ownership and access that feel native to the internet generation,” noted Salnikov.

While this perspective offers optimism, the reality for many companies is quite different. Due to low trading volumes, major platforms like Bybit, X2Y2, and Kraken have resorted to discontinuing their NFT services. 

Those that didn't shut down explored alternative avenues. For instance, Magic Eden expanded beyond NFTs with the acquisition of Slingshot. Nevertheless, Salnikov dismissed this strategy, commenting,

“We're not trying to bolt on non-NFT features just to stay busy—we're building NFT commerce that actually fits the communities using it.”

He explained that this approach uses modular, customizable on-chain marketplaces. Creators can tailor them to fit their specific audiences, whether it's a gaming project, an L3, or a legacy brand.

“NFTs are the feature—they just need the right framing,” the Rarible co-founder stated.

Going back, an interesting trend during the NFT hype era was the involvement of celebrities. High-profile figures like Justin Bieber, Madonna, and Neymar jumped on the bandwagon, attracting substantial attention to the sector. Nonetheless, their investment strategies haven't fared particularly well.

In January 2022, Bieber spent 500 ETH (approximately $1.3 million at the time) on Bored Ape #3001. This NFT is from Yuga Labs' Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection. 

However, according to the latest data, the NFT is worth only 13.51 WETH (around $24,174), a decline of 98.1%. Although the singer hasn't sold his NFT, it has received little attention lately, with no promotional efforts or notable discussions around it.

Thus, while celebrities can bring attention to NFTs, this highlights the need for substance beyond the name itself. As Salnikov pointed out, celebrity involvement in the sector is fleeting. 

According to him, a celebrity name alone can't replace genuine creative direction or a strong community.

“Celebrity drops will come and go—it's the culture behind them that determines if they stick,” he remarked.

He argued that celebrities treating NFTs as mere merchandise deters audiences. Nevertheless, when an NFT drop is intentional and truly taps into something meaningful like music, fashion, or fandom, that's where the lasting value is found.

“We're way more interested in working with creators who are building for the long haul than just chasing headlines,” Salnikov disclosed to BeInCrypto.

The executive also outlined the need for a more accessible and user-friendly approach for attracting interested users. He detailed that onboarding users should not feel “like a tech demo.” Salnikov pointed to Rarible as an example. 

According to him, Rarible focuses on ensuring that each marketplace built on its platform is a product people genuinely want to use. This involves features such as fiat onramps, low-cost mints, a clean user interface, and, most importantly, content that resonates with users. 

“We're not selling NFTs—we're powering experiences that just happen to be onchain,” Salnikov concluded.

While the NFT market faces ongoing challenges, it remains to be seen whether the industry is entering a new phase of growth or if further obstacles lie ahead in its evolution.

The Bank of England has published its latest technical update on preparations for the potential launch of a digital pound, focused on the challenges of offline payments.

A decision has yet to be made on whether to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the UK but the BoE, like many similar authorities worldwide, been exploring how to create what has been described as a ‘major national infrastructure project.'

The BoE described offline payments as ‘one of the most complicated elements of a potential UK CBDC' two-and-a-half years ago, explaining in a procurement notice (for developing a proof-of-concept and doing research) that offline payments ‘could increase acceptance and resilience of CBDC but heighten the risk of double spend as there is no online connectivity to verify the provenance of the money.'

Despite its latest experimentation, offline payments continue to remain a head-scratcher for the authority's CBDC team. ‘This project demonstrated that while it might be technically feasible to implement an offline payment functionality for a digital pound, there are trade-offs, particularly around user experience and preventing double spending and counterfeiting, that make implementing it challenging,' the BoE states in its ‘Digital pound experiment report: Offline payments'.

The BoE's latest experimentation involved work with five different private companies and explored four solutions. It demonstrated that ‘several' technology choices exist that could be made for offline payments but they are dependent on policy choices such as ‘risk appetite, product proposition and liability, which impact the options available for mitigating security risks,' the BoE summarises.

RELATED ARTICLE No ‘one-size-fits-all' solution for offline CBDC payments: BIS handbook – a news article (11 May 2023) on a 119-page handbook produced by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub in partnership with Consult Hyperion (one of the companies engaged by the BoE for the experimentation this news article is about – see below)

The BoE and HM Treasury (HMT) are currently in a ‘design phase' for a potential digital pound during which they aim to establish a ‘clear proposition' for a UK CBDC. A digital pound would only be introduced with Parliament's approval and would need primary legislation.

The central bank defines ‘offline payment' as a payment that occurs while neither payer nor payee has access to the CBDC network, ‘usually due to the lack of an internet connection.'

In its latest experimentation, the BoE worked with Thales, Secretarium, IDEMIA Secure Transactions, Quali-Sign and Consult Hyperion to assess different offline payment solutions. Thales UK had previously been awarded a contract, valued at £100,620 (about $134,000), from January 2023 to May 2023 to deliver a ‘CBDC Proof of Concept and Research of Offline Payments' (according to contract award notice published in April 2023 and previously reported by Global Government Fintech).

All solutions explored ‘achieved final and irrevocable payments (from a technology perspective) by transferring funds from the payer to the payee with immediate confirmation and settlement, enabling the payee to spend those funds immediately without having to reconnect to the network,' the BoE states in the 10 April update, explaining that ‘this is often referred to as “device” offline payments.' Other approaches exist that could also be explored, the authority adds.

The central bank points out that it explored offline payments from a technology perspective only. Other factors – such as policy, operational, legal (‘including but not limited, to the finality and irrevocability of payments from a legal perspective') and commercial considerations – will ‘need to be' explored, it continues, adding that ‘further work is required before design decisions can be made.'

In the same way that a decision has yet to be taken to launch a UK CBDC at all, a final decision has also not been taken on whether offline payment functionality would be implemented. A decision has been promised ‘around the middle of the decade' – so, imminently – on whether to build a digital pound.

An 86-page BoE ‘Digital pound: technology working paper', published just over two years ago (February 2023), contained a section on considerations related to offline payments.

A 33-page ‘Response to the digital pound technology working paper', published 15 months ago (January 2024), recorded that offline functionality ‘was generally deemed to be important'. The two main reasons given were to support financial and digital inclusion, and to enhance resilience in the case of system outages. The working paper had noted that ‘the small number of respondents who did not deem offline functionality important cited security, fraud and financial crime as the reasons.'

The four solutions explored in this latest offline payments experimentation used different technologies to implement peer-to-peer and person-to-business offline payments.

‘Online reconciliation was used as a fallback security measure in all four solutions to detect counterfeiting and double spending,' the report states. ‘Being retrospective, online reconciliation helped to detect and identify counterfeiting and double spending, but it could not prevent either. At the point at which online reconciliation happens, users would have already suffered losses.'

‘Additional countermeasures had an impact on user experience and costs,' the report continues. ‘Measures such as risk mitigation limits had a negative impact on user experience since they prevented users from making further payments offline, often unexpectedly. There might also be financial inclusion impacts since more expensive, higher-end devices were needed to guarantee stronger security.'

The technology working paper stated that offline risk mitigation limits, whether on the number of consecutive offline transactions or based on time or value, might help to reduce the scale and impact of double spending.

The offline solutions assessed in this latest experimentation implemented different risk mitigation limits. Those limits included: maximum number of consecutive transactions offline; maximum offline payment amount; maximum cumulative amount for offline transactions; and maximum amount of offline balance stored.

The BoE reports, however, that ‘challenges […] arose when implementing those limits'. It explains: ‘For example, time-based limits were difficult to implement on the smart cards since those devices did not have an internal clock. But even on devices with an internal clock, for example smartphones, security concerns around trusting the clocks made time-based limits challenging to implement.'

‘We also observed potential user experience issues,' the BoE continues. ‘For example, we needed to consider how limits would be communicated to users and whether incoming or outgoing payments would be processed when the limits were reached. Further, these limits relied on the secure element for enforcement and needed to take account of the storage constraints of the secure elements. If the secure elements were breached, those limits could also be breached.'

NFC (Near-Field Communication – short-range wireless technology) was explored. It proved ‘useful' for card-to-phone and phone-to-card payments but ‘limited the amount of data that could be shared between payer and payee during a transaction' and ‘revealed user experience issues.'

The report summarises the BoE's current perspective by stating that offline CBDC ‘would be an innovative feature with potential to support different policy goals, such as resilience or financial inclusion'. But it warns that ‘heavy reliance on secure elements meant that if the secure elements were breached, double spending and counterfeiting might occur.'

‘Secure elements are commonly used in payments today, but they are, in most cases, paired with immediate online authentication, thus limiting losses,' the central bank explains. ‘In contrast, the online layer in an offline payment (online reconciliation) occurs only after the transaction has taken place and losses have already been incurred.'

‘Our policy work on offline digital pound payments is ongoing,' the report concludes, adding that the central bank ‘expect[s] to conduct a policy assessment to determine what these findings might mean for a digital pound.' It also points out that other technical-related challenges exist that were not addressed in the project, such as what happens to offline funds if a user loses their device.

The BoE kicked off 2025 on the CBDC front by reveals plans to create a ‘Digital Pound Lab' as a ‘technology sandbox environment [to] enable hands-on experimentation' through which it will test application programming interface (API) functionality, ‘innovative use cases', and potential business models for payment interface providers (PIPs) and external service interface providers (ESIPs). The Lab is expected to run from August 2025 to July 2026, with its activities split into two phases (applications to participate in the first phase are open to 6 June 2025).

In a separate recent CBDC-related development, the central bank has also this month (April) published a ‘preliminary conceptual framework' for a digital pound ‘rulebook'.

The BoE's head of digital pound Diana Carrasco took up the role almost 18 months ago, having joined from Lloyds Banking Group. She has also previously worked at HSBC and Visa, among other companies.

              Highlights            



                        With digital assets gaining legitimacy, there's growing strategic interest from major institutions, with regulation seen not as a barrier but as a catalyst for innovation.                      


                        The U.S. government is moving away from a confrontational, enforcement-heavy stance on crypto and blockchain toward a more balanced regulatory posture, signaling support for compliance and innovation.                      


                        As clearer frameworks emerge, there may be a split in the crypto space between companies that embrace regulation and those that operate outside it, with fewer operating in legal gray zones.                      

The U.S. government's evolving approach to crypto regulation could mark a pivotal moment for payments innovation.

“There's certainly a change in how the administration views the digital assets industry,” Dan Boyle, partner at Boies Schiller Flexner, told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster. “This is not a confrontational posture.”

Until recently, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) operated under what many in the industry perceived as a “regulation by prosecution” doctrine, aggressively pursuing high-profile crypto cases while offering little regulatory guidance. But the DOJ's recent decision to pivot away from that stance, paired with growing bipartisan support for proposed frameworks for stablecoin regulation, signals a reimagining of how Washington approaches cryptocurrency oversight.

Boyle, who's seen the cryptocurrency conversation from both the prosecutor's desk and the defense table, believes that despite headline-making changes, crypto companies would be mistaken to interpret this as a green light to let down their guard.

“This shouldn't be seen as a get out of jail free card. It's just a change in posture and market participants have to recognize that,” he said.

Rather, it's a pragmatic acknowledgment that blanket hostility doesn't help to foster compliance or innovation. And as compliance improves among major exchanges and stablecoin issuers, Boyle anticipates a divergence within the crypto ecosystem.

“You're going to see a divide between some companies which become compliant and others that want to stay outside of it,” he said. “You'll just see less in the gray area.”

In other words, when it comes to cryptocurrency, sunlight may be the best disinfectant.

Crypto's global reach has created a cat-and-mouse game between innovation and illicit activity. From cross-border scams to unregulated online marketplaces, the challenge for regulators is to protect consumers without stifling progress. For many in the industry, the DOJ's shift has introduced a new dilemma: where to refocus compliance efforts, and whether the enforcement risk has truly declined.

While enforcement risk remains, the GENIUS Act has emerged as a beacon of hope for crypto firms seeking clarity. If passed, it would be the first comprehensive U.S. framework for regulating stablecoins, a digital asset class often used as an off-ramp for criminal funds but increasingly embraced by mainstream financial institutions.

“The obvious growth in stablecoins and the fact that you have a lot of issuers ready to be fully compliant. It's a hard argument for Congress to ignore,” Boyle said.

Yet not all stablecoins are created equal. Criminal organizations continue to exploit the flexibility and speed of stablecoins, particularly when issued outside the bounds of U.S. regulation.

“Even if stablecoins are the preferred medium for a lot of criminal activity, creating a regulated environment where these companies can operate in conjunction with law enforcement is probably a positive,” Boyle said.

His advice is to align with what is known: the administration's enforcement focus, recent executive orders and global geopolitical shifts. That means preparing for scrutiny around transactions linked to Venezuela, Iran or known cartels. It also means considering proactive disclosure if risky activity is detected.

“Your risk has gone up higher,” Boyle said bluntly. “You're going to have states and foreign regulators that still care about things like foreign bribery and kleptocracy. Those haven't gone away.”

The current administration, in Boyle's view, sees crypto not as a fad but as a lasting part of the financial ecosystem. And that opens the door for large enterprises that were previously sitting on the sidelines to explore partnerships, issue stablecoins or tokenize real-world assets.

“When you look at how the prior administration just kind of viewed [crypto] as an area that wasn't particularly compliant … now there's going to be a lot of freedom to develop new technology,” he said. “There's some strategic value to being a world leader in digital assets … If my competitor is issuing a stablecoin or tokenizing assets, am I missing out if I don't?”

Crypto is no longer an outsider technology. It's moving into the mainstream, with all the legal, strategic and ethical responsibilities that entails. Still, the future could hinge on one crucial thing: defining what digital assets even are. After all, as Webster noted, if you ask 10 people what a digital asset is, you'll get 15 different answers.

Boyle agreed, adding that, “even now, whatever definition we might come up with today, that may be obsolete in three to six months … Perhaps having more participants in the area is going to help us all understand what the scope of the category should be.”

Ultimately, for companies navigating crypto's uncertain terrain, Boyle offered these final words of advice: don't let your guard down, but don't sit it out.

“It is a catalyst for innovation,” he said. “And there's a lane now for companies who want to do it right.”

 Bitcoin ETFs recorded their highest inflows in over three months as investors regained confidence. 

Investments in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) rebounded to levels last seen in January, signaling a recovery in investor sentiment from concerns about global trade tariff escalations.

US spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs had over $912 million worth of cumulative net inflows on April 22, marking their highest daily investment in more than three months since Jan. 21, Farside Investors data shows.

“Bitcoin ETPs just saw the largest daily inflows since 21st January in a dramatic improvement in sentiment,” according to James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.

Investor sentiment appeared to improve after US President Donald Trump said that import tariffs on Chinese goods will “come down substantially,” adopting a softer tone in negotiations.

The de-escalation and growing ETF inflows pushed Bitcoin price above $93,000 for the first time in seven weeks, Cointelegraph reported on April 23.

The growing institutional investment and presence of ETFs may also accelerate the historic four-year cycle and bolster BTC to new highs before the end of 2025, analysts told Cointelegraph.

The US dollar's weakness may contribute to the growing investor demand for Bitcoin. 

The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the strength of the greenback against a basket of leading fiat currencies, has declined 9% since the beginning of 2025, touching a three-year low of 98.8 last seen in April 2022, TradingView data shows.

“Macro factors like a weakening dollar and rising gold correlation” may reinforce Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against economic volatility, Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, told Cointelegraph.

Crypto and traditional stock markets are “walking a tightrope between political drama and economic reality,” with Bitcoin staging a significant rebound thanks to “strong ETF inflows, institutional acquisitions, and a weakening US dollar,” according to Nexo dispatch analyst Iliya Kalchev:

“The conversation has clearly shifted. Bitcoin is no longer trading in the shadows of tech — it's becoming a lens through which macro uncertainty is priced,” he added.

Nansen CEO Alex Svanevik also praised Bitcoin's resilience, noting that the maturing asset has become “less Nasdaq — more gold” in the past two weeks, increasingly acting as a safe haven asset against economic turmoil, though concerns over economic recession may limit its price trajectory.

On April 21, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicted that this might be the “last chance” to buy Bitcoin below $100,000, as the incoming US Treasury buybacks may signal the next significant catalyst for Bitcoin price.

On February 27, 2025, the US Securities and Exchange
Commission's (SEC) Division of Corporation Finance issued
a 
staff statement (the Statement) clarifying that
“meme coins” will generally not be classified as
securities under federal law. The SEC determined that meme coins do
not typically meet the definition of security under the test
established in SEC v WJ Howey
Co,1 the leading jurisprudence for determining
what constitutes a security, meaning they would not fall under the
SEC's jurisdiction. Although staff statements are not
official rules or regulations, this announcement signals a
potential shift in the SEC's approach to the regulation of
celebrity-endorsed crypto asset ventures, which often involve the
endorsement of meme coins.

Celebrity-endorsed crypto asset ventures promise significant
returns through leveraging the influence of well-known figures to
attract investors. Such endorsements have proven to be an effective
means to enhance the credibility of crypto assets, but had
previously captured the SEC's attention given concerns of
celebrities and social media influencers promoting crypto asset
offerings that are not compliant with existing securities laws.
Scrutiny increased in light of the 
collapse of FTX Trading Ltd. — a once $32 billion
dollar2 crypto asset exchange that was endorsed by
several high-profile celebrities as a secure investment platform
— due to financial mismanagement and the misappropriation of
customer funds.3 The implications of celebrity
endorsements are especially significant given the emergence of
young investors who increasingly turn to social media to discover
and validate investment opportunities.4

The Statement prompts consideration of the current state of
celebrity-endorsed crypto asset regulation and how it might change
given the shift in the SEC's regulatory priorities, as well
as the broader impact of this shift on the Canadian regulatory
environment.

The SEC has historically taken a decisive stance on the
application of anti-touting laws (which make it unlawful to promote
a security for compensation without fully disclosing the receipt
and amount of such compensation) with respect to celebrity-endorsed
crypto assets. In 2017, following a surge of celebrities promoting
investments in initial coin offerings (ICOs), 
the SEC issued a statement urging caution around
celebrity-backed ICOs, warning that such offerings could involve
the issuance or distribution of securities which require compliance
with federal laws. It reaffirmed the requirement for persons making
endorsements of investments in ICOs to disclose compensation
received for the endorsements. More particularly, Section 17(b) of
the US Securities Act5 makes it
unlawful for any person to “publish, give publicity to, or
circulate any […] communication which […] describes
such security for a consideration […] from an issuer,
underwriter, or dealer, without fully disclosing the receipt,
whether past or prospective, of such consideration and the amount
thereof.” By requiring such disclosure, Section 17(b) aims to
safeguard the public from marketing or promotional activities
(including social media posts) that claim to offer impartial
opinions but are actually influenced by payments.

Similarly, social media marketing of financial services caught
the eye of the US Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).
In September 2021, FINRA launched a targeted examination seeking to
examine how firms found, contracted, and compensated social media
influencers to promote their products and services (e.g., referral
programs).6 In November 2022, FINRA also launched a
targeted exam to review the practices of firms actively
communicating with retail customers concerning crypto
assets.7 In its update on the 2022 Sweep, FINRA
noted having identified potential substantive violations of FINRA
Rule 2210 in approximately 70 percent of the over 500
crypto-asset-related retail communication
reviewed.8 Namely, FINRA observed false claims
about the nature of crypto assets, misleading comparisons and
explanations, omissions of key details, and misrepresentations
about legal protections and coverage. However, given the current US
administration's evolving policy on crypto asset regulation,
it is unclear whether FINRA will continue to maintain the same
level of scrutiny on social media marketing of financial
services.

In Canada, the laws surrounding anti-touting are not as robust
as in the US given the lack of a statutory equivalent to Section
17(b) above. Nonetheless, concerns regarding social media promotion
have been on the Canadian Securities Administrators' (CSA)
radar. In November 2018, the CSA released 
Staff Notice 51-356 – Problematic promotional
activities by issuers, which served to caution issuers
against engaging in promotional activities that could artificially
inflate an issuer's share price and trading volume, or
otherwise mislead investors. Such promotional activities, according
to the CSA, include compensating third parties who utilize social
media to promote issuers without disclosing their agency,
compensation, and/or financial interest. In September 2021, the CSA
and the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) jointly
issued 
Staff Notice 21-330 – Guidance for Crypto-Trading
Platforms – Requirements relating to Advertising, Marketing
and Social Media Use (SN 21-330), which addressed
deceptive advertising practices by crypto asset trading platforms
(CTPs) and third parties acting on their behalf. SN 21-330
expressed concern with CTPs' use of marketing tactics like
contests, promotions, and time-limited offers to prompt quick
trading, which could lead investors to take on excessive risks.

The Ontario Securities Commission has also taken steps to
address third-party marketing partnerships through 
Staff Notice 33-755 – Summary Report for Dealers,
Advisors and Investment Fund Managers (SN 33-755),
where it noted the requirement for issuers to establish measures to
monitor and oversee their arrangements with marketing partners
(i.e., corporations or individual bloggers/influencers with an
established online audience or following) and to verify that
statements made about the firm's products and services are
fair, substantiated, and not misleading. In particular, SN 33-755
noted that registered firms should provide sufficient disclosure to
make clients aware of the arrangement between the firm and the
marketing partner and any associated conflicts of interest,
including compensation paid to the marketing partner.

The British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC) has also been
active in regulating promotional activities lacking appropriate
disclosure. In May 2021, the regulator published the 
proposed British Columbia Instrument 51-519 (the Proposed
Instrument), which would mandate that TSX Venture issuers who
retain or compensate individuals for promotional activities must
issue and file a news release that includes details, such as the
contact information of the engaged party, the platforms on which
the promotional activities will occur, and the compensation to be
provided for these activities. Although the Proposed Instrument is
not yet in effect, the BCSC has actively addressed undisclosed
online paid promotional activities by relying on existing
provisions of the Securities Act (British
Columbia), specifically Section 52(2) which provides as
follows:9

52(2) A person engaged in investor
relations activities, and an issuer or security holder on whose
behalf investor relations activities are undertaken, must ensure
that every record disseminated, as part of the investor relations
activities, by the person engaged in those activities clearly and
conspicuously discloses that the record is issued by or on behalf
of the issuer or security holder.

For example, in January 2023, the BCSC found in Re
Stock Social Inc.,10that investor relations records
must “clearly and conspicuously” disclose if they are
disseminated by or on behalf of an issuer or security holder under
Section 52(2). The panel noted that the obligation applies to
promotional and marketing materials, including social media posts
by influencers and is binding on issuers and those disseminating
the promotional advertisements in British Columbia. In April 2024,
the BCSC released 
BC Notice 51-703, wherein it reiterated the key points from the
decision in Re Stock Social Inc.

Celebrity and influencer involvement in ICOs and retail
investments has evolved beyond merely receiving undisclosed
payments for promotions. Given their ability to leverage their
influence on social media platforms, celebrities and influencers
are well-equipped to engage in market manipulation by artificially
inflating or deflating asset prices, which would be considered
non-compliant with Section 10(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 193411 and Rule
10b-512  thereunder. These provisions prohibit any
individual from directly or indirectly employing any means to
defraud, making false statements, omitting pertinent information,
or otherwise engaging in business practices that would deceive
another party during securities transactions.

While the current presidential administration has shifted
priorities away from the enforcement-focused approach of the
previous administration, the SEC had relied on these rules in
enforcement actions involving market manipulation and insider
trading. For instance, 
the SEC charged Ishan Wahi, his brother, and a close
friend with insider trading in crypto assets, violating
Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. Wahi, a manager at Coinbase Global,
Inc., was reportedly part of a “tight circle” that was
entrusted with knowledge of which crypto asset securities would be
listed on Coinbase's exchange, as well as the anticipated
timing of such listings. A token being listed on an exchange or
marketplace can have a material effect on its
price.13 The SEC accused Wahi, his brother, and his
friend of trading ahead of announcements. The brothers settled the
insider trading charges by agreeing to permanent injunctions
against violating securities laws, paying disgorgement of
ill-gotten gains, and serving prison time.14

In Canada, anti-market manipulation and anti-fraud provisions
are found in National Instrument 23-101 and provincial securities
laws. For example, Section 126.1 of the Securities
Act (Ontario) provides that it is prohibited to engage,
or attempt to engage, in any conduct related to securities or
derivatives that creates a misleading appearance of trading
activity or an artificial price, or that perpetrates
fraud.15 Section 126.2 also provides that making
materially misleading or untrue statements that could significantly
affect the market price or value of a security or derivative is
prohibited.16 Insider trading is addressed
separately; in Ontario, prohibitions are contained in the Section
76(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), which
provides that no person or company in a special relationship with
an issuer can trade securities of the issuer or disclose material
facts or changes about the issuer that have not been generally
disclosed.17

Although these provisions apply to social media influencers
engaged in market manipulation and insider trading schemes,
Canadian provincial regulators have yet to pursue cases analogous
to those handled by the SEC. Nonetheless, the CSA has recently
commented on the existing framework surrounding market manipulation
and insider trading in the context of evolving technologies,
indicating a readiness to address similar issues involving crypto
assets.18

The SEC's Statement has introduced ambiguity into the
regulatory landscape surrounding celebrity-endorsed crypto assets,
particularly meme coins. As outlined above, regulatory actions in
this area have historically relied on securities-related
legislation. However, the SEC's clarification that meme coins
generally do not constitute securities under federal law challenges
this approach. This raises broader questions about how authorities
might regulate the influence of celebrities in the crypto asset
space beyond meme coin ventures, especially as their endorsements
continue to significantly impact investor behaviour.

In Canada, the classification of meme coins as securities
remains unresolved, and there is a limited track record of
regulatory action concerning celebrity-endorsed crypto asset
ventures. While Canadian regulators are increasingly vigilant about
the potential risks posed by undisclosed promotional activities,
particularly in the realm of social media and digital marketing,
the SEC's stance adds further uncertainty to the approach
that Canadian regulators might adopt in this realm.

Vitalik Buterin will be stepping away from the day-to-day coordination of the Ethereum Foundation.

Tomasz K. Stanczak, the co-executive director of the foundation, says recent changes in leadership will free up the ETH co-creator's time “for research and exploration” rather than crisis response.

“Each time Vitalik shares insights or communicates a direction, he accelerates major long-term breakthroughs. His recent posts on RISC-V and zkVMs have advanced promising avenues, while his writing on privacy has helped realign the community around the Ethereum Foundation's core values. I want to make clear that Vitalik's proposals will always carry weight, but they are intended to start conversations and encourage progress in difficult research areas. Community review may refine them significantly or even reject them.”

Stanczak says the Ethereum Foundation's research effort will shift toward near-term goals like improving user experience and scaling.

“We are concentrating on Layer 1 scaling, support for Layer 2 scaling, and significant UX (user experience) improvements (including interoperability) in the Pectra, Fusaka, and Glamsterdam upgrades.

In parallel, we are exploring ways to bring forward projects that currently look three to five years away. Posts from our top researchers help some of them to ship within one or two years through initiatives such as next-generation execution and consensus layers.”

Yuga Labs has filed a turnover order in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, in an effort to seize crypto assets held by influencer Jeremy Cahen, also known online as Pauly0x.

The assets, spread across four wallets, include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and PEPE coin, and total nearly $400,000 as of last October.

Yuga Labs sued Cahen and artist Ryder Ripps in July 2022 for infringing on Yuga Labs' trademark through the sale of the Ryder Ripps Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection. 

Ripps had launched the copycat project in May 2022 as a form of “parody” and protest, claiming Bored Ape NFTs featured hidden Nazi and racist imagery. 

The court sided with Yuga, awarding it over $1.5 million in damages in October 2023. The following February, this increased to nearly $9 million in total, including $7 million in attorneys' fees and post-judgment interest.

The final judgment, entered on February 2, 2024, became enforceable by March 3. Cahen has not posted a bond or obtained a stay of enforcement, which has allowed Yuga Labs to begin post-judgment asset recovery.

The company has since subpoenaed Cahen's accountant and served levies—delivered by U.S. Marshals—on banks and crypto platforms including Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo, Robinhood, Coinbase, Binance, and Gemini.

“Yuga Labs has taken affirmative steps under California law, essentially every month since the Court issued its Final Judgment to locate and execute upon Cahen's assets," the company said in its most recent filing. 

"Still, Cahen has made a mockery of this Court's Final Judgement by refusing to pay any portion of the judgment or comply with any post-judgment discovery.”

Court records show Cahen moved $396,946 in crypto to avoid a levy served to Gemini. According to Yuga, this transfer occurred one day after the levy was issued—before Gemini could freeze his accounts—suggesting a deliberate effort to evade asset seizure.

Gemini, in response to a subpoena, provided transaction records from Cahen's account, showing that he moved crypto into two new wallets.

Cahen maintains that he is not obligated to comply with discovery requests while his appeal is pending, despite lacking a formal stay. Cahen, who has promoted various meme coins and been accused of being a scammer, branded himself “the most censored man on X” following the suspension of his account last year.

Puerto Rican authorities confirmed in February that Cahen is wanted for aggravated assault. In February, he was placed on the top 10 most wanted list in San Juan, the island's capital. His current project, a DEX called Pond0X, has been called a scam by critics.

The court has not yet ruled on Yuga Labs' turnover motion. Decrypt has approached Cahen for comment via Instagram.

Ethereum (ETH) is under pressure as it attempts to recover from one of its worst-performing years among major cryptocurrencies, down nearly 50% in 2025. Despite signs of improving momentum, with RSI climbing and EMA lines hinting at a potential breakout, ETH continues to lag behind competitors like Solana in multiple metrics. 

The ETH/BTC ratio has plunged to multi-year lows amid heavy institutional sell-offs. As ETH approaches key resistance, the market remains divided, with bulls eyeing a breakout and skeptics questioning the chain's long-term relevance.

Ethereum is currently the worst-performing major crypto asset in 2025, with its price down nearly 51% year-to-date, significantly underperforming Bitcoin (-5 %), Solana (-25.5 %), BNB (-13.5 %), and even XRP, which is up 1%.

This steep underperformance has sparked growing concerns about Ethereum's future, especially as alternative chains like Solana and Base continue to gain momentum. 

Solana is now leading the sector in key on-chain metrics such as DEX volume, apps revenue, and user activity, while Base is quickly capturing developer interest. 

As these competitors rise, Ethereum's dominance is being increasingly challenged across both narrative and usage, with some analysts even suggesting that XRP's market cap could soon surpass Ethereum's.

The ETH/BTC ratio has collapsed to 0.01791 — its lowest point since 2020 — highlighting the scale of Ethereum's decline relative to Bitcoin. 

This drop has been accelerated by major sell-offs from institutions, including Galaxy Digital, which offloaded over $100 million in ETH in just one week. The Ethereum Foundation and Paradigm have also made large-scale transfers, contributing to investor unease. Additionally, Solana recently surpassed Ethereum in Staking Market Cap. 

Compounding the issue are Ethereum's low staking rates and Bitcoin's growing dominance, both of which are shifting market sentiment and capital away from ETH. 

As a result, Ethereum's position as the leading smart contract platform is being questioned more seriously than ever before.

Ethereum's Relative Strength Index (RSI) has climbed to 57.26, up from 42.43 just a day ago, signaling a notable uptick in short-term momentum. 

The RSI is a technical indicator that measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate whether an asset is overbought or oversold. It ranges from 0 to 100, with values above 70 typically indicating overbought conditions and values below 30 pointing to oversold levels. 

Readings between 50 and 70 usually suggest moderate bullish momentum, while those between 30 and 50 lean bearish or neutral.

With ETH's RSI now at 57.26, the asset is in bullish-neutral territory. It shows improving momentum but is not yet strong enough to indicate overheating. 

Importantly, Ethereum hasn't seen an RSI reading above 70 since March 24 — nearly a month ago — which signals that despite the recent bounce, it hasn't entered overbought territory or shown signs of a sustained breakout. 

This suggests cautious optimism: while buyers are regaining control, Ethereum still lacks the aggressive momentum that typically drives significant price rallies. If the RSI continues to rise and breaks above 70, it could point to stronger bullish sentiment returning.

Ethereum's EMA lines are starting to show signs of a potential bullish reversal. The price is now approaching a key resistance level at $1,669. If that level breaks, Ethereum price could target $1,749 next. 

With strong momentum, it may even reach $1,954 — its first time above $1,900 since April 2. Short-term EMAs are moving closer to longer-term ones, a setup that supports this bullish outlook. Rising trading volume would further strengthen the case.

A successful breakout could help restore some investor confidence amid a challenging year for ETH.

However, skepticism around Ethereum's long-term positioning continues to grow within the crypto community, particularly as rival chains gain traction.

If ETH fails to maintain upward momentum, it could retest the $1,535 support zone. A breakdown below that level would shift the structure back to bearish, opening downside targets at $1,412 and potentially $1,385. 

In that scenario, Ethereum's inability to reclaim key levels could further fuel doubts about its competitive edge, especially in light of rising activity on faster and cheaper alternatives.

Metrics details

Recent advances in quantum communications have underscored the crucial role of optical coherence in developing quantum networks. This resource, which is fundamental to the phase-based architecture of the quantum internet1, has enabled the only successful demonstrations of multi-node quantum networks2,3,4 and substantially extended the range of quantum key distribution (QKD)5. However, the scalability of coherence-based quantum protocols remains uncertain owing to the specialized hardware required, such as ultra-stable optical cavities and cryogenic photon detectors. Here we implement the coherence-based twin-field QKD protocol over a 254-kilometre commercial telecom network spanning between Frankfurt and Kehl, Germany, achieving encryption key distribution at 110 bits per second. Our results are enabled by a scalable approach to optical coherence distribution, supported by a practical system architecture and non-cryogenic single-photon detection aided by off-band phase stabilization. Our results demonstrate repeater-like quantum communication in an operational network setting, doubling the distance for practical real-world QKD implementations without cryogenic cooling. In addition, to our knowledge, we realized one of the largest QKD networks featuring measurement-device-independent properties6. Our research aligns the requirements of coherence-based quantum communication with the capabilities of existing telecommunication infrastructure, which is likely to be useful to the future of high-performance quantum networks, including the implementation of advanced quantum communication protocols, quantum repeaters, quantum sensing networks and distributed quantum computing7.

In metamaterials design, the name of the game has long been "stronger is better."

Metamaterials are synthetic materials with microscopic structures that give the overall material exceptional properties. A huge focus has been in designing metamaterials that are stronger and stiffer than their conventional counterparts. But there's a trade-off: The stiffer a material, the less flexible it is.

MIT engineers have now found a way to fabricate a metamaterial that is both strong and stretchy. The base material is typically highly rigid and brittle, but it is printed in precise, intricate patterns that form a structure that is both strong and flexible.

The key to the new material's dual properties is a combination of stiff microscopic struts and a softer woven architecture. This microscopic "double network," which is printed using a plexiglass-like polymer, produced a material that could stretch over four times its size without fully breaking. In comparison, the polymer in other forms has little to no stretch and shatters easily once cracked.

The researchers say the new double-network design can be applied to other materials, for instance to fabricate stretchy ceramics, glass, and metals. Such tough yet bendy materials could be made into tear-resistant textiles, flexible semiconductors, electronic chip packaging, and durable yet compliant scaffolds on which to grow cells for tissue repair.

"We are opening up this new territory for metamaterials," says Carlos Portela, the Robert N. Noyce Career Development Associate Professor at MIT. "You could print a double-network metal or ceramic, and you could get a lot of these benefits, in that it would take more energy to break them, and they would be significantly more stretchable."

Portela and his colleagues will report their findings in the journal Nature Materials. His MIT co-authors include first author James Utama Surjadi as well as Bastien Aymon and Molly Carton.

Inspired gel

Along with other research groups, Portela and his colleagues have typically designed metamaterials by printing or nanofabricating microscopic lattices using conventional polymers similar to plexiglass and ceramic. The specific pattern, or architecture, that they print can impart exceptional strength and impact resistance to the resulting metamaterial.

Several years ago, Portela was curious whether a metamaterial could be made from an inherently stiff material, but be patterned in a way that would turn it into a much softer, stretchier version.

"We realized that the field of metamaterials has not really tried to make an impact in the soft matter realm," he says. "So far, we've all been looking for the stiffest and strongest materials possible."

Instead, he looked for a way to synthesize softer, stretchier metamaterials. Rather than printing microscopic struts and trusses, similar to those of conventional lattice-based metamaterials, he and his team made an architecture of interwoven springs, or coils. They found that, while the material they used was itself stiff like plexiglass, the resulting woven metamaterial was soft and springy, like rubber.

"They were stretchy, but too soft and compliant," Portela recalls.

In looking for ways to bulk up their softer metamaterial, the team found inspiration in an entirely different material: hydrogel. Hydrogels are soft, stretchy, Jell-O-like materials that are composed of mostly water and a bit of polymer structure. Researchers including groups at MIT have devised ways to make hydrogels that are both soft and stretchy, and also tough. They do so by combining polymer networks with very different properties, such as a network of molecules that is naturally stiff, which gets chemically cross-linked with another molecular network that is inherently soft. Portela and his colleagues wondered whether such a double-network design could be adapted to metamaterials.

"That was our 'aha' moment," Portela says. "We thought: Can we get inspiration from these hydrogels to create a metamaterial with similar stiff and stretchy properties?"

For their new study, the team fabricated a metamaterial by combining two microscopic architectures. The first is a rigid, grid-like scaffold of struts and trusses. The second is a pattern of coils that weave around each strut and truss. Both networks are made from the same acrylic plastic and are printed in one go, using a high-precision, laser-based printing technique called two-photon lithography.

The researchers printed samples of the new double-network-inspired metamaterial, each measuring in size from several square microns to several square millimeters. They put the material through a series of stress tests, in which they attached either end of the sample to a specialized nanomechanical press and measured the force it took to pull the material apart. They also recorded high-resolution videos to observe the locations and ways in which the material stretched and tore as it was pulled apart.

They found their new double-network design was able stretch three times its own length, which also happened to be 10 times farther compared to a conventional lattice-patterned metamaterial printed with the same acrylic plastic. Portela says the new material's stretchy resistance comes from the interactions between the material's rigid struts and the messier, coiled weave as the material is stressed and pulled.

"Think of this woven network as a mess of spaghetti tangled around a lattice. As we break the monolithic lattice network, those broken parts come along for the ride, and now all this spaghetti gets entangled with the lattice pieces," Portela explains. "That promotes more entanglement between woven fibers, which means you have more friction and more energy dissipation."

In other words, the softer structure wound throughout the material's rigid lattice takes on more stress thanks to multiple knots or entanglements promoted by the cracked struts. As this stress spreads unevenly through the material, an initial crack is unlikely to go straight through and quickly tear the material. What's more, the team found that if they introduced strategic holes, or "defects," in the metamaterial, they could further dissipate any stress that the material undergoes, making it even stretchier and more resistant to tearing apart.

"You might think this makes the material worse," says study co-author Surjadi. "But we saw once we started adding defects, we doubled the amount of stretch we were able to do, and tripled the amount of energy that we dissipated. That gives us a material that's both stiff and tough, which is usually a contradiction."

The team has developed a computational framework that can help engineers estimate how a metamaterial will perform given the pattern of its stiff and stretchy networks. They envision such a blueprint will be useful in designing tear-proof textiles and fabrics.

"We also want to try this approach on more brittle materials, to give them multifunctionality," Portela says. "So far we've talked of mechanical properties, but what if we could also make them conductive, or responsive to temperature? For that, the two networks could be made from different polymers, that respond to temperature in different ways, so that a fabric can open its pores or become more compliant when it's warm and can be more rigid when it's cold. That's something we can explore now."

New multidisciplinary research led by Prof. Tomás Ryan from Trinity College Dublin shows that the brain forms memories of cold experiences and uses them to control our metabolism. This newly published study is the first to show that cold memories form in the brain -- and map out how they subsequently drive thermoregulation.

The discovery may have important applications in therapies designed to treat a range of disorders -- from obesity to cancer -- in which thermoregulation and metabolism (or a lack of control in this area) plays a role, as well as opening the door to more fundamental research, which could help us better understand how memories impact our behaviour and emotions.

In 1897, the physiologist Ivan Pavlov first described classical conditioning, where animals and humans form associations between different aspects of the environment. He showed that dogs could be trained to salivate in hopeful anticipation of food, when an associated bell was rung. Classical or Pavlovian conditioning has since become a core staple of neuroscience and psychology.

Long-term memories are stored in the brain as ensembles of inter-connected cells, termed engrams. Increasingly, modern neuroscience is beginning to identify engrams that encode for bodily representations, such as experiences of infection; inflammation; food consumption; and pain.

The researchers behind this work hypothesised that the brain may form engrams for temperature representations, and that these would serve to help an organism survive in changing temperatures. But to identity these engrams they first had to test whether cold memories could form in the first place.

While memories are generally measured as changes in animal behaviour, the Ryan Lab collaborated with Prof. Lydia Lynch (then at Trinity College Dublin, now at Princeton University). They focused on metabolism as a first-order readout of cold experience, because mammals are known to increase their metabolism to create heat in the body when the environment is cold, via a process of adaptive thermogenesis.

Lead author of the article published today in the journal, Nature,, Dr Andrea Muñoz Zamora, successfully trained mice to associate a cold experience of 4oC with novel visual cues that were only present in designated cold contexts. After a few days, mice were presented with the visual cues in the same context, but at room temperature. Crucially, the team discovered that the animals would upregulate their metabolism to induce predictive thermogenesis when they were "expecting" the environment to be cold.

Having established that mice could form memories of cold experiences, the team then delved into how this was happening in the brain. Using activity-dependent gene labelling, the scientists were able to genetically hitchhike onto the engram cells coding for the cold memory in a brain region known as the hippocampus. Remarkably, when these cold engram cells were artificially stimulated (using a technique called optogenetics), the mice increased their metabolism in order to generate heat. And in a converse experiment, to double-check the central finding, when cold engram cells were inhibited the mice were unable to express cold memories in response to the conditioned visual cues.

Dr Muñoz Zamora, said: "We discovered that when mice are exposed to a cold temperature they form memories that allow them to up-regulate their body's metabolism when they anticipate cold experiences in the future."

Prof. Lynch added: "A large part of this learned control of body temperature seems to be due to increased activity of brown adipose tissue -- or brown fat -- which can be controlled by innervations originating in the brain. Our brain must learn from the bodily experiences of cold, but then feeds back to control how our fat cells respond to cold."

Dr Aaron Douglas, who was joint lead author on the study, said: "Numerous clinical disorders, ranging from obesity to forms of cancer, may be treated by manipulating thermoregulation through brown adipose tissue. In the future, it will be important to test whether the manipulation of cold memories in humans could provide novel avenues for altering metabolism for therapeutic purposes."

This research opens many new doors for further discovery research, as well as the development of treatments. Understanding how representations of cold experiences affect broader brain functions such as emotion, decision-making, and social behaviour will provide insights into the embodied nature of the mind, for example.

"The sophisticated aspects of our minds evolved from more basic, visceral, bodily representations," said Prof. Ryan. "Understanding how these components of our brain affect our behaviour in general is crucial to understanding our emotions and our use of memory."

"This integrative piece of work offers a quintessential example of inter-disciplinary science. Neuroscience requires collaboration and it was the synergy with Prof. Lynch that allowed the unusual combination of memory engram work with metabolism research."

Firing Science Advisors Will Leave the U.S. Senseless

From public health to space exploration, advisory panels have helped U.S. agencies make smarter decisions. The Trump administration wants to kill them

In the Trump administration's ongoing race to make the U.S. poorer, sicker and dumber, one more stomp on the accelerator comes from cuts aimed against its federal advisory committees. Whether infectious diseases or space exploration, these panels of experts are the unpaid brains behind the brawn of the U.S. government.

With its signature disdain for anything smacking of smarts or competence, the Trump administration now aims to destroy or neutralize them. In a February 19 executive order, Donald Trump directed his staff to compile a list of “Federal Advisory Committees that should be terminated on grounds that they are unnecessary.” The order directly terminated the HHS Advisory Committee on Long COVID (a syndrome afflicting 23 million people in the U.S. right now) and the Health Equity Advisory Committee, which sought to help underserved people access care like blood pressure medication or postpartum treatment, through Medicare and Medicaid. Since then NOAA has closed several of its advisory panels, NSF closed a dozen, NASA has consolidated its wildly disparate astrophysics, biological and physical sciences, Earth science, heliophysics and planetary sciences panels into one body, and the U.S. Geological Survey closed its new scientific integrity body, alongside five others at the Department of Interior that included a climate adaptation panel. “This means that you, the public, will be more at-risk of being harmed because the scientific integrity and misconduct issues that were prevalent before will continue to persist,” wrote integrity panel member Jacob Carter. He called the committee's cancellation, “an indicator that this administration has no intention to uphold scientific evidence in its decisions.”

He's right; contrary to the executive order, these committees matter. Cutting away advisory panels hurts everyone and leaves the U.S. government uninformed when making critical decisions that affect millions of lives, alongside a public left in the dark about what advice agencies do receive. These advisors, a “fifth arm of the government,” have long served as a thorn in the side of polluters and lobbyists, putting them under siege for decades, and doubtless in the gunsights of the giddily for-sale Trump administration. A 2021 Ecology Law Quarterly review found past end runs around advisory committees were linked to lead pollution, fracking contamination of drinking water, and worse air quality.

Federal advisory committees operate under a 1972 law, which governs the roughly 1,000 expert committees advising federal agencies on evidence-based practices on issues like boating safety or railroad retirement benefits at a yearly cost of $400 million. The panels are a bargain, providing by law “fairly balanced” expert advice that includes disclosures of financial conflicts of interest, and providing information openly to the public. The best-known examples from the pandemic were those FDA and CDC panels that voted on the safety and rollout of COVID vaccines to much attention.

History repeats when it comes to attacks on advisory panels. In 2019 Trump ordered a one-third cut in the number of them. The order took aim at science panels at NASA, the NSF and the Energy Department, in particular. The first Trump administration's sheer incompetence kept many of those kinds of closures at bay. His then EPA chief resorted to stuffing a clean air panel with industry stooges instead, and an antiabortion advocates panel lacking any scientific credibility was whipped up to eliminate fetal tissue research at NIH.

Now, however, the crush of executive orders and disregard for Congress seen in the first 100 days of the new regime make things look even more dire. The dangerous, unqualified HHS chief Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., has forced out top FDA vaccine official Peter Marks, who oversaw the vaccine panel that held steadily to public health principles during the pandemic, refusing to bend to Trump's demand for an “October Surprise” vaccine to save himself in the 2020 election. All Department of Homeland Security advisory committees members were fired in January, halting a probe into a massive Chinese breach of U.S. telecommunications infrastructure.

Perhaps the clearest sign of the scientific advice we can instead expect from the Trump administration comes from RFK, Jr., naming an unqualified antivaccine activist, one who in 2011 was disciplined for practicing medicine without a license, to head a phony study to make autism “preventable” by September. The cruelty of his dishonest sham, founded on disdain for the autistic community and aimed at parents of autistic children, defies decency. It seems squarely aimed at making kids sick by discouraging vaccination.

In the first Trump administration, his appointees also skirted the law requiring keeping advisory meetings open to the public. Such secrecy will be indubitably ubiquitous amid the news administration's “completely insane” meetings held on Signal, and tariff decisions surrounded by suspected insider trading. In our unhinged current moment, it's hard to recall that Trump campaign bankroller Elon Musk quit a Trump presidential advisory committee in 2017 over the withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. So much for the scruples that drove him then. Now he (wink-wink) doesn't really run the run-amok DOGE staffers stealing data, jobs and buildingsin secrecy across the nation's capital. In acting as an advisor but not an appointee, he is a one-man circumvention of openness.

One of the trials of the Trump era is that its malignancy comes packaged in a cloud of buffoonery: take your pick from Musk waving a chainsaw around on stage or an education secretary calling artificial intelligence “Ay-One” or any of Trump's inane digressions that should have triggered the 25th Amendment in his first term.

But his administration's steps, large and small, from attacking universities to immigrants to expert advisors, aimed at destroying competence and honesty as guiding principles for the U.S., will in the end yield only tears, not laughter. Wrecking the federal advisory committee system is just one more tread on a path to American ruin.

Metrics details

Patients with treatment-refractory pancreatic cancer often succumb to systemic metastases1,2,3; however, the transcriptomic heterogeneity that underlies therapeutic recalcitrance remains understudied, particularly in a spatial context. Here we construct high-resolution maps of lineage states, clonal architecture and the tumour microenvironment (TME) using spatially resolved transcriptomics from 55 samples of primary tumour and metastases (liver, lung and peritoneum) collected from rapid autopsies of 13 people. We observe discernible transcriptomic shifts in cancer-cell lineage states as tumours transition from primary sites to organ-specific metastases, with the most pronounced intra-patient distinctions between liver and lung. Phylogenetic trees constructed from inferred copy number variations in primary and metastatic loci in each patient highlight diverse patient-specific evolutionary trajectories and clonal dissemination. We show that multiple tumour lineage states co-exist in each tissue, including concurrent metastatic foci in the same organ. Agnostic to tissue site, lineage states correlate with distinct TME features, such as the spatial proximity of TGFB1-expressing myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts (myCAFs) to aggressive ‘basal-like' cancer cells, but not to cells in the ‘classical' or ‘intermediate' states. These findings were validated through orthogonal and cross-species analyses using mouse tissues and patient-derived organoids. Notably, basal-like cancer cells aligned with myCAFs correlate with plasma-cell exclusion from the tumour milieu, and neighbouring cell analyses suggest that CXCR4–CXCL12 signalling is the underlying basis for observed immune exclusion. Collectively, our findings underscore the profound transcriptomic heterogeneity and microenvironmental dynamics that characterize treatment-refractory pancreatic cancer.

Metrics details

Acute myocardial infarction is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide1. Clinical studies have shown that the severity of cardiac injury after myocardial infarction exhibits a circadian pattern, with larger infarcts and poorer outcomes in patients experiencing morning-onset events2,3,4,5,6,7. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these diurnal variations remain unclear. Here we show that the core circadian transcription factor BMAL17,8,9,10,11 regulates circadian-dependent myocardial injury by forming a transcriptionally active heterodimer with a non-canonical partner—hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF2A)12,13,14,15,16—in a diurnal manner. To substantiate this finding, we determined the cryo-EM structure of the BMAL1–HIF2A–DNA complex, revealing structural rearrangements within BMAL1 that enable cross-talk between circadian rhythms and hypoxia signalling. BMAL1 modulates the circadian hypoxic response by enhancing the transcriptional activity of HIF2A and stabilizing the HIF2A protein. We further identified amphiregulin (AREG)16,17 as a rhythmic target of the BMAL1–HIF2A complex, critical for regulating daytime variations of myocardial injury. Pharmacologically targeting the BMAL1–HIF2A–AREG pathway provides cardioprotection, with maximum efficacy when aligned with the pathway's circadian phase. These findings identify a mechanism governing circadian variations of myocardial injury and highlight the therapeutic potential of clock-based pharmacological interventions for treating ischaemic heart disease.

Cardiac injury after acute myocardial infarction (MI) exhibits pronounced circadian rhythmicity, with severity and clinical outcomes varying on the basis of the time of onset2,3,4,5,6,7. Circadian rhythms, driven by the Earth's day–night cycles, synchronize internal biological functions with environmental changes, enabling organisms to adapt to the daily fluctuations18,19. At the core of these rhythms are transcription factors, notably BMAL17,8,9,10,11, which forms a heterodimer with CLOCK to regulate clock-controlled genes8,10,11,20. Although clinical and preclinical studies have highlighted the importance of circadian rhythms in cardiovascular physiology and diseases6,7,21,22,23,24, the mechanisms underlying circadian variations in myocardial injury remain poorly understood. This knowledge gap poses challenges to therapeutic efficacy and may contribute to suboptimal treatment outcomes21,25. Here we identify a molecular mechanism in which cross-talk between circadian rhythms and hypoxia signalling13,14,15,26,27,28,29,30 underpins circadian-dependent cardioprotection. Given the universal and essential roles of these pathways across nearly all cells and organs, our findings have broad implications for advancing the understanding and treatment of ischaemic diseases influenced by circadian rhythms.

Consistent with previous studies27,31, diurnal variations in cardiac injury and long-term outcomes were evident in a mouse myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) model, with the least injury at zeitgeber time 8 (ZT8; 15:00) and the most severe at ZT20 (03:00) (Supplementary Fig. 1). To identify the molecular factors that drive these circadian variations, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on area-at-risk (AAR) samples collected after 2 h of reperfusion at ZT8 and ZT20. This analysis revealed distinct transcriptional profiles, with 18 genes upregulated and 42 downregulated at ZT8 compared with at ZT20 (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Notably, BMAL1 target genes, including Per2, Per3, Nr1d2 and Dbp, were significantly upregulated at ZT8 (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 1), indicating elevated BMAL1 transcriptional activity. Conversely, Bmal1 transcript levels were downregulated at ZT8, exhibiting an antiphasic expression pattern relative to its targets, a hallmark of circadian transcription–translation feedback loops10,11,20. Analysis using quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT–qPCR) confirmed these oscillations (Fig. 1c). Gene Ontology (GO) (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 2) and KEGG (Extended Data Fig. 1c) pathway analyses identified ‘circadian rhythm' as a highly enriched pathway, while a dysregulation network further emphasized BMAL1's central role in orchestrating diurnal gene expression in ischaemic mouse hearts (Extended Data Fig. 1d).

Source Data

To investigate transcriptional pathways in human hearts experiencing myocardial injury at different times of the day, we examined left ventricle (LV) biopsy samples from 73 patients undergoing elective aortic valve replacement surgery (NCT00281164). Samples from the morning (n = 56, median, 10:32) or afternoon (n = 17, median, 17:15) cohort were collected before and after around 80 min of ischaemia induced by aortic cross-clamping (Fig. 1e). Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were comparable between cohorts (Supplementary Table 3). RNA-seq analysis of pre-clamping samples revealed significant circadian modulation of gene expression, with BMAL1 identified as the most downregulated gene in the morning cohort (Extended Data Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 4), suggesting its role in the time-of-day-dependent regulation of cardiac physiology, such as metabolism and contractility6,21,22,23,24,32,33. Post-clamping RNA-seq analysis revealed distinct transcriptional signatures based on surgery timing (Extended Data Fig. 1f), with timing emerging as the dominant determinant over covariates such as smoking or comorbidities (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 5). BMAL1 remained substantially downregulated in the morning cohort (Fig. 1g, Extended Data Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 6), further implicating it in modulating the heart's ischaemic response. GO and KEGG analyses revealed significant enrichment in the ‘circadian rhythm' pathway (Fig. 1h, Extended Data Fig. 1h and Supplementary Table 7), with antiphasic expression patterns of BMAL1 and its targets paralleling murine observations (Fig. 1i). These findings suggest that the conserved role of BMAL1 as a transcription factor is involved in regulating circadian variations in myocardial injury across species.

To further explore BMAL1's functional role, we generated an inducible cardiomyocyte-specific Bmal1-knockout mouse line (Bmal1loxP/loxPMyh6-cre; hereafter, Bmal1loxP/loxP myosin-Cre+) by crossing floxed Bmal1 mice with myosin-Cre+ mice and inducing Bmal1 ablation by tamoxifen injection at 8 weeks of age. We then subjected Bmal1loxP/loxP myosin-Cre+ mice and control myosin-Cre+ mice to myocardial IRI at ZT8 or ZT20 (Fig. 1j). After 2 h of reperfusion, Bmal1-deficient mice showed abolished circadian variability in myocardial injury and diminished endogenous cardioprotection at ZT8 compared with the controls (Fig. 1k–n). This phenotype persisted during extended reperfusion (day 14 after MI), as speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE)34,35 demonstrated that ZT8 Bmal1-deficient mice exhibited significantly reduced systolic function (ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening (FS), global longitudinal strain (GLS)), greater LV dilation (end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume) and LV mass (end-diastolic LV mass and end-systolic LV mass) (Fig. 1o and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Impaired contractility was evident in both infarcted (anterior mid and posterior apex) and non-infarcted (posterior mid and posterior base) heart segments, indicating more extensive myocardial injury (Supplementary Fig. 2b,c). Pronounced intraventricular disparities further suggested heart failure progression35 (Fig. 1p,q). By contrast, IRI at ZT20 showed no significant differences in cardiac function between knockout and control mice. These findings highlight BMAL1's key role in circadian regulation of acute myocardial injury and long-term outcomes.

As a key member of the basic helix-loop-helix PER–ARNT–SIM (bHLH-PAS) family, BMAL1 exerts regulatory functions through interactions with specific partners8,10,11,20. Using the Human Reference Interactome (HuRI)36, we identified hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF2A, also known as EPAS1), another bHLH-PAS family member, as the most abundantly expressed BMAL1 interactor in human LV (largest node in Fig. 2a). GO analysis highlighted shared roles of BMAL1 and HIF2A in transcriptional regulation and cellular responses to hypoxia and oxidative stress (Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 8). Given the severe hypoxia during MI13,15,26,28 and HIF2A's established role in oxygen homeostasis16,37, we examined the BMAL1–HIF2A interaction under hypoxic conditions. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays in HEK293 cells revealed a robust BMAL1–HIF2A nuclear interaction under ambient hypoxia (1% O2, 4 h), distinct from the oxygen-insensitive BMAL1–CLOCK interaction (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 2b). Consistent with previous reports38, binding of BMAL1 to HIF1A is considerably weaker (Fig. 2b,c). We further validated in primary human cardiomyocytes (HCMs) using endogenous co-IP and proximity ligation assay (PLA)39, confirming a robust BMAL1–HIF2A interaction at the single-molecule level under hypoxia, while BMAL1–HIF1A binding was also detected, albeit at significantly lower levels (Fig. 2d–f). The N-terminal regions of BMAL1 and HIF2A, containing conserved bHLH and PAS-A/B domains, mediate partner dimerization8,40 (Fig. 2g), while their C-terminal transactivation domains enable transcriptional activation40. Pull-down assays using recombinant BMAL1 and HIF2A demonstrated direct binding between their N-terminal regions (Fig. 2h). Size-exclusion chromatography confirmed the formation of a stable BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimer (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). Despite a 67% sequence identity between the N-terminal regions of HIF1A and HIF2A, BMAL1 exhibits notably weaker binding to HIF1A (Fig. 2h). These results demonstrate a specific and direct interaction between BMAL1 and HIF2A during hypoxia.

Although HIF2A is well recognized for its cardioprotective role against myocardial IRI16,28,41, its involvement in diurnal cardiac injury remains unclear. After 2 h of reperfusion, HIF2A protein levels were notably stabilized in the nuclear fraction of the AAR at ZT8 but not ZT20, paralleling BMAL1 expression (Fig. 2i,j), suggesting a time-of-day-dependent myocardial hypoxic response. On day 1 after MI, immunofluorescence revealed significantly higher HIF2A levels in the cytoplasm and nuclei of cardiomyocytes in the border zone (ischaemic region) at ZT8 compared with at ZT20, while expression remained low in the remote myocardium (Extended Data Fig. 3a–c). BMAL1 displayed a similar diurnal nuclear localization pattern (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e), with significantly greater co-localization with HIF2A in the ZT8 border zone (Fig. 2k), indicating circadian regulation of their interaction. To elucidate the functional role of HIF2A in circadian myocardial injury, we used an inducible cardiomyocyte-specific Hif2a knockout model (Hif2aloxP/loxP myosin-Cre+)16,41. Similar to the Bmal1-deficient mice, these mice exhibited abolished circadian-dependent cardiac injury and diminished endogenous cardioprotection at ZT8 (Fig. 2l–o). On day 14 after MI, STE revealed worsened systolic function, increased LV dilation and mass, and greater wall motion abnormalities and intraventricular disparities in ZT8 Hif2aloxP/loxP myosin-Cre+ mice compared with the controls (Fig. 2p–s and Supplementary Fig. 2d–f). These changes were absent at ZT20. By contrast, cardiomyocyte Hif1a deletion did not affect circadian variations in myocardial injury (Supplementary Fig. 3a–k). These results highlight a selective role for cardiomyocyte-specific HIF2A in regulating diurnal susceptibility to IRI.

Next, to investigate how the BMAL1–HIF2A complex influences diurnal variations of myocardial injury, we reanalysed our previously published microarray data from Hif2aloxP/loxP myosin-Cre+ and myosin-Cre+ mice16. Among potential HIF2A target genes that are uniquely upregulated in myosin-Cre+ mice after IRI (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 9), Areg—a known HIF2A target and member of the epidermal growth factor family16,17—exhibited the largest diurnal fold change in the AAR at ZT8 compared with at ZT20 (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 10). AREG protein levels in cytosolic extracts mirrored this diurnal pattern, peaking at ZT8 (Fig. 3c,d). Immunofluorescence staining confirmed elevated AREG expression in the cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes within the border zone at ZT8, while infarcted and remote myocardium showed low levels (Fig. 3e,f and Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). Minimal AREG expression was detected in fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). This spatiotemporal pattern aligns with BMAL1 and HIF2A nuclear co-localization in the ZT8 border zone (Fig. 2k), suggesting that the BMAL1–HIF2A complex drives diurnal Areg induction in ischaemic hearts.

To assess the role of the cell-intrinsic molecular clock in AREG regulation, synchronized HCMs were exposed to hypoxia (1% O2, 4 h) at different circadian times (CT0 to CT40). CT0 marks the start of the circadian cycle in vitro, corresponding to ZT0, the onset of the light phase in light-entrained systems. Under normoxia, AREG transcript levels were non-rhythmic, but hypoxia significantly induced AREG at CT32 (analogous to ZT8), with a much weaker induction at CT20 (Fig. 3g). This pattern mirrored the rhythmic expression of the BMAL1–HIF2A complex in HCMs (Fig. 3h,i), suggesting circadian-dependent, hypoxia-driven regulation of AREG. Silencing HIF2A or BMAL1 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly reduced hypoxia-induced AREG expression, whereas CLOCK, HIF1A or HIF1B knockdown had no effect (Fig. 3j). Consistently, myocardial IRI-induced Areg expression was markedly reduced in cardiomyocytes from Bmal1- or Hif2a-deficient mice (Fig. 3k–m). Together, these findings underscore the BMAL1–HIF2A complex as a key regulator of rhythmic AREG induction during both hypoxia and myocardial IRI.

To examine how the BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimer regulates AREG, we investigated its DNA-binding properties and potential transcriptional synergy under hypoxia. HIF2A–HIF1B and BMAL1–CLOCK complexes bind to hypoxia response elements (HREs, [A/G]CGTG)40 and E-box motifs (CACGTG)8, respectively, which share notable sequence similarity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Supplementary Fig. 3l) and surface plasmon resonance analysis (Fig. 3n,o) demonstrated robust and comparable binding of the BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimer to both motifs, confirming its ability to recognize DNA elements of target genes. Analysis of the human AREG promoter using JASPAR (https://jaspar.elixir.no/; v.2022) revealed a conserved binding site (CAGGTG) for BMAL1 and HIF2A across species (Fig. 3p). Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by qPCR (ChIP–qPCR) in HCMs confirmed significant binding enrichment of endogenous HIF2A to this site under hypoxia at CT32 but not at CT20 (Fig. 3q), indicating circadian gating of HIF2A transcriptional activity. This finding aligns with circadian-dependent BMAL1–HIF2A interaction, which peaks at CT32 (Fig. 3r) and corresponds to enhanced AREG induction (Fig. 3g). Additional ChIP–qPCR confirmed direct BMAL1 binding to the same conserved site during hypoxia (Fig. 3s). To evaluate functional cross-talk between BMAL1 and HIF2A at the chromatin level, the conserved sequence was cloned into a luciferase reporter and transfected into HEK293 cells. Both proteins enhanced luciferase activity, with co-transfection producing a synergistic effect and greater activation (Fig. 3t). These findings demonstrate that BMAL1 and HIF2A function as an integrated regulatory unit, synergistically driving rhythmic AREG transcription during hypoxia.

To determine whether AREG directly contributes to circadian variations in myocardial injury, we analysed its role using genetic deletion models. Similar to Bmal1- and Hif2a-deficient mice, Areg−/− mice exhibited a loss of circadian variations in myocardial injury and diminished endogenous cardioprotection at ZT8 after 2 h of reperfusion (Fig. 4a–e). Diurnal variations in long-term outcomes, including cardiac function, LV size and mass, segmental wall motion abnormalities and intraventricular synchronicity, observed in wild-type (WT) controls, were completely absent in Areg−/− mice by day 14 after MI (Fig. 4f,g and Supplementary Fig. 4a–d). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labelling (TUNEL) staining, which detects double-stranded DNA breaks as a marker of apoptosis, revealed significantly increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the border zone of Areg−/− mice at ZT8 compared with in WT mice, with minimal differences observed at ZT20 (Fig. 4h,i). These findings indicate a functional role of AREG in regulating daytime-dependent cardiac injury.

Building on AREG's critical role in circadian injury modulation, we assessed its therapeutic potential through exogenous administration and gene delivery. To mimic a clinical scenario of reperfusion treatment, recombinant AREG (10 µg) or vehicle was administered to C57BL/6J mice at the onset of reperfusion. Timed AREG treatment elevated AREG protein levels in the AAR (Fig. 4j–l) and significantly reduced infarct size and serum troponin I levels after 2 h of reperfusion. Notably, protection was greater at ZT20, potentially compensating for the lower endogenous AREG levels at that time (Fig. 4m–p). Furthermore, AREG (10 µg) administered daily for 3 days after injury at ZT20 improved LV systolic function, reduced cardiac remodelling, restored segmental contractility and re-established normokinesis by day 14 after MI compared with the vehicle controls (Fig. 4q,r and Supplementary Fig. 4e–h). TUNEL staining on day 1 after MI revealed notably reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the border zone in ZT20-treated mice (Fig. 4s,t). To further assess its therapeutic potential, we used adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) to deliver the Areg gene under the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter for cardiomyocyte-specific targeting. Tail-vein injection of Areg-AAV (2 × 1011 genome copies (GC) per mouse) significantly increased AREG levels in the heart by day 28, with minimal off-target expression (Supplementary Fig. 5a–e). This intervention reduced the infarct size and improved cardiac function, with greater effects at ZT20 (Supplementary Fig. 5f–n). These findings establish AREG as a promising therapeutic target for time-optimized interventions, offering strategies to harness circadian rhythms for improved cardiac protection.

To examine the translational potential of modulating circadian rhythms for cardioprotection, we used nobiletin (NOB), a flavonoid that enhances circadian rhythms by directly activating RORs42, key transcriptional activators of Bmal110,20. NOB treatment in C57BL/6J mice (200 mg per kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.)) significantly upregulated RORα, leading to a 60–80-fold increase in Bmal1 mRNA and a 2–3-fold increase in protein levels at both ZT8 and ZT20, ultimately inducing AREG upregulation in the heart (Extended Data Fig. 5a–d). Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed elevated nuclear BMAL1 and cytoplasmic AREG in cardiomyocytes in the border zone on day 1 after MI (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f). NOB treatment significantly attenuated acute myocardial injury, improved long-term cardiac function and reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, with more pronounced protection observed at ZT20 (Extended Data Fig. 5g–n), probably due to its ability to compensate for the natural trough in nuclear BMAL1 expression and transcriptional activity at this time10,11,20. To determine whether NOB's cardioprotective effects depend on the BMAL1–HIF2A–AREG pathway, we evaluated its efficacy in genetic knockout models. Cardioprotection was completely abrogated in Hif2a-deficient mice treated with NOB, as evidenced by larger infarct sizes and significantly impaired cardiac function (Supplementary Fig. 6a–h). Similarly, NOB treatment failed in Bmal1loxP/loxP myosin-Cre+ mice (Supplementary Fig. 6i–o) and Areg−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 6p–u), confirming the essential role of this pathway. To further assess the benefits of BMAL1 overexpression, we used AAV9 to deliver Bmal1 specifically to cardiomyocytes (Supplementary Fig. 7a–e). BMAL1 overexpression significantly reduced infarct size and improved cardiac function with greater protection observed at ZT20 (Supplementary Fig. 7f–o). These effects mirrored those of NOB treatment, highlighting the therapeutic potential of BMAL1 activation in attenuating myocardial injury and advancing the development of circadian-targeted pharmacological strategies.

To investigate the therapeutic potential of HIF2A activation in myocardial injury, C57BL/6J mice were treated with vadadustat, a prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) inhibitor15 (50 mg per kg, i.p., daily for 3 days) at ZT8 or ZT20. Vadadustat selectively stabilized HIF2A, particularly at ZT8, without affecting HIF1A levels (Extended Data Fig. 6a–d), potentially due to circadian regulation of PHD enzyme activity31. This stabilization significantly reduced infarct sizes and improved cardiac function in ZT8-treated mice, indicating time-dependent cardioprotection (Extended Data Fig. 6e–n). Analysis using co-IP revealed enhanced BMAL1–HIF2A binding in the nuclear fraction of the AAR at ZT8, accompanied by increased AREG expression in cardiomyocytes in the border zone after 3 h of reperfusion (Extended Data Fig. 6o–r). These findings suggest that BMAL1–HIF2A interaction and synergistic AREG induction underlie the circadian-dependent cardioprotection conferred by vadadustat at ZT8. To confirm this mechanism, vadadustat treatment was evaluated in Bmal1-deficient mice, which showed abolished cardioprotection at ZT8, highlighting a BMAL1-dependent mechanism (Supplementary Fig. 8a–g). A similar loss of protection was observed in Hif2a- and Areg-deficient mice, further supporting the essential role of the BMAL1–HIF2A–AREG pathway (Supplementary Fig. 8h–s). Moreover, cardiomyocyte-specific human-HIF2A knock-in mice (LSL-HIF2dPA myosin-Cre+) exhibited similar circadian-dependent HIF2A stabilization and increased Areg induction at ZT8 in mouse hearts (Supplementary Fig. 9a–c). Consistent with vadadustat treatment, HIF2A overexpression significantly reduced infarct size and improved cardiac function, with the most pronounced benefits at ZT8 (Supplementary Fig. 9d–m). These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of time-of-day-dependent HIF2A stabilization in enhancing cardioprotection, paving the way for new chronotherapy interventions.

Circadian-dependent HIF2A stabilization was observed after myocardial IRI, hypoxia, vadadustat administration and in cardiomyocyte-specific HIF2A knock-in mice (Figs. 2i,j, 3h,i, Extended Data Fig. 6a–d and Supplementary Fig. 9a,b), suggesting that clock genes may regulate HIF2A expression. However, RNA-seq and qPCR analyses revealed no circadian variations in Hif2a transcripts after IRI in humans and mice (Extended Data Fig. 7a–c). In Bmal1-deficient mice, nuclear HIF2A protein levels were reduced without changes in Hif2a transcripts, while NOB treatment further stabilized HIF2A protein at both ZT8 and ZT20, again without affecting transcript levels (Extended Data Fig. 7d–k). Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments in HCMs corroborated these findings, indicating a post-translational regulatory mechanism (Extended Data Fig. 7l–q). ChIP–qPCR analysis of predicted E-box elements in the HIF2A promoter showed no detectable BMAL1 binding, suggesting that BMAL1 does not directly regulate HIF2A transcriptionally (Extended Data Fig. 7r). Instead, cycloheximide (CHX) chase assays demonstrated that BMAL1 prolongs the HIF2A protein half-life by reducing its ubiquitin-mediated degradation (Extended Data Fig. 7s–x). Notably, BMAL1 did not affect HIF1A protein stability. These findings identify a role for BMAL1 in stabilizing HIF2A through post-translational mechanisms, offering insights into how circadian rhythms modulate hypoxic response during myocardial injury.

Given BMAL1's interaction with HIF2A, we assessed its influence on the HIF2A–HIF1B complex, which mediates canonical hypoxia signalling. RNA-seq analysis of ischaemic LV biopsy samples from patients and mouse AAR revealed no circadian variation in Hif1b transcript levels (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments in mice and HCMs further confirmed that BMAL1 does not regulate HIF1B transcript or protein levels during IRI or hypoxia (Extended Data Fig. 8c–n). Co-IP analysis showed that BMAL1 overexpression has no impact on HIF2A–HIF1B binding, while ChIP–qPCR revealed no changes in HIF1B binding to the erythropoietin (EPO) promoter43 (Extended Data Fig. 8o–q). Moreover, HIF1B was not observed to bind the AREG promoter, and luciferase reporter assays confirmed that BMAL1 does not affect the transcriptional activity of the HIF2A–HIF1B complex on PGK1 (Extended Data Fig. 8r,s). These findings demonstrate that BMAL1 interacts with HIF2A without disrupting the canonical HIF2A–HIF1B complex, emphasizing its distinct role in circadian regulation of hypoxic responses.

Although the interaction between BMAL1 and HIF2A has been reported38,44,45, the structural information of their heterodimerization remains unclear. To determine the structure using single-particle cryo-EM, we expressed and purified the N-terminal regions of BMAL1 and HIF2A, including the bHLH and PAS domains, bound to a 22-bp DNA containing a canonical HRE element (Fig. 2g, Extended Data Fig. 9a and Supplementary Table 11). After two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) classification, the final approximately 43,000 polished particles were processed for 3D refinement, resulting in a density map with an average resolution of 3.6 Å (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 9b–h). In brief, HIF2A exhibited a better overall resolution compared with BMAL1, probably due to its compact structure and stabilization by BMAL1. An atomic model of the DNA-bound heterodimer was built into the density map using the structures of BMAL1 and HIF2A from the BMAL1–CLOCK8 and HIF2A–HIF1B40 complexes as templates, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 9i,j and Supplementary Table 11).

In the structure, BMAL1 and HIF2A exhibit distinct architectures (Fig. 5b). HIF2A adopts a compact conformation, with the PAS-A domain bridging the bHLH and PAS-B domains, whereas the corresponding domains in BMAL1 are arranged more loosely, lacking interdomain contacts (Fig. 5c). BMAL1 uses its bHLH and PAS domains to wrap around their respective counterparts in HIF2A, establishing four major interfaces (I to IV) (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). Similar to classical bHLH transcription factors, the BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimer binds to the DNA through two α-helices, H1 and h1, from their bHLH domains, inserting into the major groove46 (Extended Data Fig. 10c). Owing to slight mobility, the density of the DNA bases is not well resolved in the map.

Notably, the structure of BMAL1 bound to HIF2A differs significantly from that of its complex with CLOCK8, in which the PAS domains of BMAL1 are tightly packed together (Extended Data Fig. 10d). By contrast, in the BMAL1–HIF2A structure, the PAS domains of BMAL1 are positioned separately and arranged in a conformation similar to the HIF1B observed in its complex with HIF2A. The conformational similarity between BMAL1 and HIF1B is probably due to their significant sequence identity (44%) in the N-terminal region, where several residues involved in HIF2A binding are conserved (Extended Data Fig. 10d and Supplementary Fig. 10). As both BMAL1–CLOCK and BMAL1–HIF2A complexes bind to DNA through their bHLH domains, we superimposed the bHLH domain of BMAL1 and observed that its PAS domains bend in nearly opposite directions. Similarly, superimposing the PAS-A domains of BMAL1 reveals conformational variability in the bHLH and PAS-B domains (Extended Data Fig. 10e,f). These structural comparisons suggest that BMAL1 undergoes significant conformational changes to accommodate different partners (Supplementary Video 1). Notably, proteins with PAS domains in the bHLH family typically form alpha–beta dimers47. In the BMAL1–HIF2A structure, two PAS-B domains form an open end-to-end alpha–beta dimer, with the conserved Trp427 in BMAL1 interacting with Met250 in HIF2A to stabilize the PAS-B dimer (Extended Data Fig. 10d). However, it is unclear whether this interaction allows HIF2A to bind to other factors, similar to the PAS-B interaction between CLOCK and CRY18,48.

To strengthen our structural observations, we mutated conserved residues within each domain of BMAL1. These mutations disrupted BMAL1–HIF2A complex formation both in vitro and in HEK293 cells under hypoxia, underscoring the essential role of each domain in heterodimer stability (Fig. 5e–h). Using a luciferase-reporter assay with a human AREG-gluc reporter containing the common binding sequence (CAGGTG), we observed that BMAL1 mutants significantly impaired BMAL1–HIF2A transactivation at the AREG promoter, underscoring the importance of proper heterodimerization for AREG induction (Fig. 5i). Collectively, our study provides the structural basis of the DNA-bound BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimer, highlighting its role in regulating target genes, such as AREG, and the capability of BMAL1 in bridging diverse pathways through structural rearrangements for partner binding (Fig. 5j).

Our study underscores the pivotal role of the BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimer in mediating circadian-dependent cardioprotection. This conclusion is supported by robust evidence, including the cryo-EM structure, the diurnal interaction between BMAL1 and HIF2A under hypoxia and during IRI, their functional roles in the synergistic transactivation of AREG and their interdependence in mediating circadian-dependent cardioprotection. However, we cannot conclusively prove that BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimerization is the bona fide mechanism regulating the time-of-day dependence of myocardial injury. Although our findings indicate that cardiomyocyte HIF1A does not significantly affect circadian variations in myocardial injury, the established interaction between BMAL1 and HIF1A31,49 warrants further investigation into whether BMAL1–HIF1A interactions in other cells contribute to circadian myocardial injury. Moreover, while we demonstrate that BMAL1 enhances HIF2A transcriptional activity and stabilizes it by reducing ubiquitination, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. For example, it is uncertain whether BMAL1 directly regulates HIF hydroxylation or influences HIF2A levels through alternative post-translational modifications. Finally, the contributions of other circadian rhythm molecules, such as PER2, and their interactions with HIFs may also have a role in this phenomenon27. Further elucidation of these pathways could advance chronotherapeutic strategies to optimize HIF-targeted interventions13,14,15. The widespread presence of peripheral molecular clocks across various cardiac cell types21 emphasizes the need to define BMAL1's tissue-specific roles for coordinated cardiac protection. Our BMAL1–HIF2A–DNA structure reveals BMAL1's ability to undergo structural rearrangements to bind a non-canonical partner, enabling cross-talk between signalling pathways. It also provides a molecular basis for developing therapeutics to stabilize this interaction, offering opportunities for treating ischaemic heart disease. Given the feasibility of integrating circadian timing into clinical practice, prospective trials are needed to evaluate whether aligning treatments with circadian phases or directly targeting circadian rhythms can improve outcomes in patients with MI. Beyond MI, circadian modulation of hypoxic responses may have broader implications for other hypoxia- and inflammation-related diseases with circadian characteristics, potentially paving the way for clock-based therapeutic innovations.

We examined samples from a prospective study of myocardial injury in humans undergoing cardiac surgery (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00281164). The study population consisted of consecutive patients (aged ≥20 years) with aortic stenosis referred to our cardiovascular surgery department at Brigham and Women's Hospital for aortic valve replacement (with or without coronary artery bypass graft) between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2014. Patients enrolled in a concurrent drug or device trial were excluded. This ongoing study involved 56 patients in the morning (samples collected between 08:00 and 12:00; median time, 10:32) and 17 patients who underwent the same procedure in the afternoon (samples collected between 15:00 and 21:00; median time, 17:15). Patients whose surgery fell outside of these time periods were excluded from the analysis. The ethics committee for the Protection of Human Subjects from Research Risks of Brigham and Women's Hospital approved the protocol, and written informed consent was obtained from all of the patients.

Patients underwent aortic valve replacement in the morning or afternoon by the same senior surgeon. Anaesthesia, cardiopulmonary bypass, cardioplegia and surgical procedures were done according to standard guidelines. Anaesthesia was induced with intravenous fentanyl or sufentanil and propofol (0.5–1.5 mg per kg) and maintained with isoflurane. Surgery was done using normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass and repeated antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia. LV biopsy samples were obtained from both the morning and afternoon patient cohorts before and after approximately 80 min of aortic cross-clamping—a procedure that temporarily halts blood flow to the heart. The samples were taken from the site of the routinely placed LV vent.

Animal care was performed according to the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals of the National Institutes of Health. All experimental procedures were approved by the UTHealth Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The sample size was estimated based on published literature on previous murine models of myocardial IRI27. All of the mice were housed under a standard 12 h–12 h light–dark photoperiod at 22 °C with ad libitum access to a standard chow diet, and maintained at a humidity level of 40–60%.

To generate cardiomyocyte-specific deletion, myosin-Cre+ (A1cfTg[Myh6-cre/Esr1*]1Jmk/J, The Jackson Laboratory, 005650), Hif1aloxP/loxP (B6.129-Hif1atm3Rsjo/J, The Jackson Laboratory, 007561), Hif2aloxP/loxP (Epas1tm1Mcs/J, The Jackson Laboratory, 008407), LSL-HIF2dPA (Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(HIF2A*)Kael/J, Jackson Laboratory, 009674), and Bmal1loxP/loxP (B6.129S4(Cg)-Bmal1tm1Weit/J, The Jackson Laboratory, 007668) mice, aged 8 weeks, were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and crossbred as previously described16,27. To address sex as a biological variable, both male and female mice aged 8 to 16 weeks underwent myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion surgery. Our sex-specific analysis, which included assessments of infarct size, troponin levels and cardiac function, revealed no significant differences between sexes29,50. To induce Cre-recombinase activity, mice received an i.p. injection of tamoxifen at a dosage of 1 mg per day for five consecutive days, as previously described29,30,50. A recovery period of 7 days was allowed after the final tamoxifen dose before proceeding with further experimental procedures. In these experiments, myosin-Cre+ mice were used as controls. Moreover, Areg−/− mice (B6;129-Aregtm1Dle/Mmnc, MMRRC, MMRRC_011533-UNC)51 aged 8 weeks were purchased from Mutant Mouse Resources & Research Centers. To circumvent lactation difficulties observed in younger female mice, Areg−/− mice were bred using a heterozygous (Areg+/−) strategy16,41. Control mice for these experiments were C57BL/6J (The Jackson Laboratory, 000664) mice aged 8 weeks, chosen for their same genetic background as the Areg−/− mice. Genotyping for all mouse strains was conducted by GeneTyper (NY).

The mouse model used in the study was subjected to a period of entrainment for at least 2 weeks within circadian cabinets (Actimetrics) to establish a stable circadian rhythm42. After this acclimatization period, the mice underwent an in situ procedure for myocardial IRI at different times of day (ZT2, ZT8, ZT14 or ZT20), as described in previous publications27,29,30,50,52. In brief, the mice were anaesthetized using 1–3% isoflurane delivered by a compact small-animal anaesthesia device (RWD), followed by endotracheal intubation and ventilation using a VentStar Small Animal Ventilator (RWD). Once anaesthetized, the mice were placed into a supine position and received pre-incisional analgesia with sustained-release buprenorphine (0.1 mg per kg, subcutaneous; ZooPharm). Throughout the procedure, their body temperature was consistently maintained at 37 °C with a ThermoStar Homeothermic Blanket equipped with rectal feedback control (RWD). The surgical procedure was meticulously performed using a research stereomicroscope system, SZX10 (Olympus). We temporarily ligated the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery approximately 2 mm from its emergence beneath the left atrium, using Surgipro II 7–0 monofilament polypropylene sutures (Covidien). The success of this ligation was confirmed by observing blanching or a pale discolouration of the anterior wall of the heart, a reduction in wall movement and the presence of ST-segment elevation on an electrocardiogram (ECG). After 45 min of induced ischaemia, reperfusion was initiated to restore the blood flow. The effectiveness of reperfusion was verified both by the resolution of ST-segment elevation on the ECG and through direct visual inspection, where a return of colour and movement in the previously affected area of the heart was noted. After surgery, the mice were carefully transferred back to the circadian cabinets for recovery and continued observation. Any mice that did not survive within the first 48 h after MI were considered to have experienced technical complications and were consequently excluded from further analysis. Blinding was implemented for the individuals analysing the data, including those calculating infarct size and measuring serum troponin I levels, to ensure unbiased data interpretation. However, blinding the surgeons performing the surgeries was logistically challenging due to the nature of the procedures. Despite this, the surgeries were carried out by experienced surgeons, ensuring consistency. To confirm the similarity of conditions, we calculated the AAR/LV, which showed comparable values across ZT and treatment/vehicle groups. This suggests that any differences observed in the study are largely due to experimental conditions rather than variations in the surgical procedure.

All cell lines and primary cells used in this study, including HEK293 cells (ATCC, CRL-1573) and human primary cardiomyocytes (ScienCell Research Laboratories, 6200), were authenticated by short-tandem-repeat profiling, as performed by the manufacturers. Moreover, the cell lines were tested for mycoplasma contamination by the manufacturers and were subsequently tested monthly for potential contamination throughout the study. All mycoplasma contamination tests yielded negative results. Furthermore, none of the cell lines used in this study are listed in the database of commonly misidentified cell lines maintained by the International Cell Line Authentication Committee (ICLAC) and NCBI Biosample.

To simulate the clinical scenario in which treatment is initiated after the onset of MI, mouse recombinant AREG protein (R&D Systems) was prepared in 0.9% NaCl solution, and a dosage of 10 µg AREG was administered at the start of the reperfusion phase. Furthermore, to assess the long-term effects of timed AREG treatment on cardiac function, a post-injury treatment regimen was implemented. In this protocol, AREG (10 µg) was administered through i.p. injection at either ZT8 or ZT20 daily for the first 3 days after myocardial IRI. For control purposes, an equivalent volume of 0.9% NaCl solution was administered as a vehicle.

In the NOB treatment experiments, Mice were administered either DMSO (as a vehicle control) or NOB at a dose of 200 mg per kg body weight. The administration was carried out through i.p. injection and repeated on an every-other-day basis. This treatment protocol was followed for 2 weeks before the surgical procedure and was specifically timed within the ZT14–ZT20 time window. To evaluate the long-term effects of NOB on cardiac function and remodelling, the same dosing regimen was continued after IRI. The chosen dosing regimen was based on several considerations: first, the dosage range was consistent with those used in previous studies (100–200 mg per kg per day)42,53, and it was aligned with the active phase of the mice. Second, daily dosing was intentionally avoided to prevent the entrainment of the experimental mice to the dosing schedule as an artificial zeitgeber. Third, previous single-dose pharmacokinetic assays demonstrated a favourable pharmacokinetic profile for NOB, with significant exposure detected in the serum, brain and liver42. Considering that NOB levels were typically undetectable within 8–24 h after administration42,54, we opted for an every-other-day dosing strategy to prevent incomplete clearance over the 4-week experimental period.

The AAR of the heart was collected after 2 h of reperfusion from the C57BL/6J mice subjected to myocardial IRI at either ZT8 or ZT20. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and was used to construct RNA-seq libraries, which were then sequenced using the Illumina 1.9 platform (75 bp paired end). Alignment of RNA sequencing tags was restricted to those mapping to the same DNA strand as annotated in the GRCm38 reference genome, using STAR (v.2.7.10a). Quantification of transcripts was conducted by calculating the fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) values, along with transcript counts. In the preprocessing step of mRNA analysis, any gene identified as non-expressed, defined as having an FPKM expression level less than 1 in more than 80% of samples, was excluded. The normalized expression profiles of these mRNAs were then subjected to PCA for quality control and to evaluate sample similarity. Differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq255 pipeline, with DEGs being identified based on a threshold of 1.5-fold change and an adjusted P < 0.05, as determined using the Benjamini–Hochberg method56.

The functional enrichment analysis of the identified DEGs was conducted using the GO and KEGG pathway databases with the WebGestalt tool57 (http://www.webgestalt.org/; v.2019). For rigorous validation, only pathways and GO terms with an adjusted P < 0.05 were included. In constructing the gene regulation network, we used known transcription factor (TF)–mRNA interactions from the TRRUST_v258 and Chipbase_v259 databases. Moreover, the mouse protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was integrated from the STRING database (v.11.5)60, with a focus on interactions having a combined score above 900. Considering the limited sample size at each timepoint, we merged six samples from both conditions to calculate the Spearman's correlation coefficient (SCC), ensuring robust and meaningful analysis. In finalizing the gene regulation network, we merged the TF–mRNA regulation network with the PPI data, specifically targeting interactions where both genes were differentially expressed. We also selectively incorporated edges with high SCC into our network, tailored to align with the specific conditions of our experimental design.

For human RNA-seq and subsequent bioinformatic analysis, we began by excluding outlier samples that failed to cluster appropriately, resulting in a total of 73 samples for analysis, including 56 morning and 17 afternoon samples derived from various sequencing protocols. Quality control of raw sequencing reads identified adaptor sequences from the Illumina Nextera platform in some samples, which were subsequently trimmed using Cutadapt (v.4.1)61. kallisto (v.0.46.1)62 was used to quantify transcript-level expression by mapping to a transcript index built from GENCODE human transcript (v.44)63. We next used tximport to convert these transcript-level quantifications to gene read counts64. Differential expression analysis was performed with DESeq2 (v.1.34.0)55, with particular attention paid to sequencing batch to control for batch effects. Genes displaying a log2-transformed fold change of greater than 0.5 and P < 0.01 were deemed to be significant. For enrichment analysis, we used the GO annotation (v.1.1) for humans, using all genes annotated by at least one GO term65 as the background in Fisher's exact test to identify over-represented biological processes. Moreover, the R package KEGGREST (v.1.36.0) was used to extract KEGG pathway annotations, and Cytoscape (v.3.10.0) was used to construct network plots for the identified KEGG pathways.

The microarray assay for gene expression transcript levels of post-ischaemic myocardium from myosin-Cre+ or Hif2aloxP/loxP myosin-Cre+ mice was reanalysed using data obtained from the GEO (GSE67308)16. Differential expression analysis was performed using GEO2R, with limma precision weights applied and the remaining options set to default66.

The assessment of myocardial infarct size was conducted by determining the percentage of infarcted myocardium within the AAR using a previously established method16,27,29,30,50. After 2 h or 1 day of reperfusion, the hearts were flushed with PBS and then subjected to permanent occlusion of the left coronary artery. 1 ml of 1% Evans blue dye (Sigma-Aldrich, E2129) was then infused through the carotid artery catheter. After infusion, the hearts were excised and sectioned into 1 mm slices using a microtome (Roboz, SA-4130). These heart sections were subsequently double-stained with 1% TTC (Sigma-Aldrich, T8877) for 10 min at 37 °C and then fixed in 10% formalin overnight. The double-stained heart slices were photographed, and ImageJ software (NIH, Fiji v.2.1.0) was used to calculate the infarct size.

Serum samples were collected from mice subjected to myocardial IRI at various ZTs through the inferior vena cava after 2 h of reperfusion. The measurement of serum troponin I, a highly sensitive biomarker for cardiac injury, was conducted using the mouse cardiac troponin-I SPARCL kit (Life Diagnostics, CTNI-SP-1), as we have done previously16,27,29,30,50.

Cardiac function and structure were assessed by transthoracic echocardiography using the Vevo3100 Ultrasound system (VisualSonics). Mice were lightly sedated with 0.5–1.0% isoflurane and positioned on a heated platform equipped with ECG monitoring. Validation criteria included consistent, uninterrupted tracking of the endocardium throughout the cardiac cycles, maintaining a heart rate between 450 and 550 beats per minute, and a frame rate exceeding 250 fps. Two-dimensional grey-scale echocardiographic images were obtained from parasternal long-axis and short-axis views. Longitudinal strain represented myocardial shortening at the endocardium, while radial strain indicated shortening at the mesocardium. All image acquisitions and subsequent offline measurements were conducted by a single investigator who was blinded to the grouping of the animals.

For strain analysis using Vevo LAB (FUJIFILM VisualSonics, v.5.7.1), we carefully selected suitable B-mode loops, ensuring a clear view of the endocardial border and no image artefacts. Three consecutive cardiac cycles with distinct ECG recordings were chosen for in-depth analysis. Semi-automated tracing of the endocardial and epicardial borders was performed, with adjustments made as necessary to maintain optimal tracking quality throughout each cine loop. The tracked images were then processed frame by frame for strain measurements34,67,68. The resulting strain values were averaged across these cardiac cycles, providing comprehensive data on the LV systolic function (EF, FS and GLS), LV size (end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume) and LV mass (end-diastolic LV mass and end-systolic LV mass).

In analysing regional and global cardiac dynamics, such as contractility and synchronicity, the LV endocardium was delineated using 48 sampling points34,67. This method divided the chamber into six segments for detailed examination in the long-axis view: basal anterior, mid anterior, apical anterior, basal posterior, mid posterior and apical posterior segments67. In myocardial IRI models, the mid anterior, apical anterior and apical posterior wall segments were designated as the infarct region, and the remaining segments were categorized as the non-infarct region34. Peak systolic strain, indicating the percentage change in length during myocardial contraction and relaxation, was calculated using the formula: ε = (L1 − L0)/L0, where L0 is the initial length and L1 is the final length69. This calculation was applied to each segment to evaluate the peak systolic strain (%) and the time-to-peak systolic strain (ms). Abnormal ventricular contractility patterns were evaluated on the basis of the magnitude of systolic strain (segment peak strain) and its timing (peak of shortening). Dyssynchrony was specifically identified by a pattern of reduced systolic strain magnitude, early opposing deflection and a delayed time-to-peak systole. Akinesis was defined as minimal or no contractility, with peak systolic strain values between −5% and 5%. Dyskinesis was described as systolic motion of the ventricle occurring in the opposite direction of normal contraction. Moreover, intraventricular disparity was measured by assessing the intraventricular delay in the time-to-peak strain and the s.d. of the time-to-peak strain across segments34,70.

HCMs were obtained from ScienCell Research Laboratories (ScienCell, 6200) and isolated from human hearts71. The cells were synchronized using 200 nM dexamethasone, which was replaced with complete media (ScienCell, 6101) after 1 h. After synchronization, we initiated a series of hypoxia treatments, exposing different batches of cells to 1% oxygen for 4 h at systematic 4-h intervals to capture cellular responses at various circadian phases. The first hypoxia session started immediately after synchronization (CT0) and lasted for 4 h (referred to as the CT4 timepoint). Subsequent treatments were applied every 4 h: from CT4 to CT8 (CT8 timepoint), and so on, continuing up to CT40. Immediately after each hypoxia period, cells were collected to evaluate transcript and protein levels.

To ensure valid results, we carefully selected timepoints for post-synchronization analysis. After synchronization, cells require a stabilization period to re-establish their circadian rhythms, and early evaluations may capture this adjustment phase rather than true circadian behaviour72. Moreover, dexamethasone induces immediate stress responses and activates signalling pathways unrelated to circadian changes73,74. Administering hypoxia treatments too soon after synchronization could overlap these stress responses, confounding the circadian-related changes we aim to measure. For this reason, early timepoints like CT8 were excluded, and we focused on later timepoints to minimize these effects and ensure that the data reflect circadian-driven changes.

HCMs were synchronized by dexamethasone (200 nM) for 1 h and then exposed to normoxia or hypoxia (1% oxygen) for 4 h at CT20 and CT32 in Fig. 3q. HEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-mBmal1 (a gift from A. Sancar, Addgene, 31367)75 and treated with normoxia or hypoxia (1% oxygen) for 4 h in Fig. 3s. ChIP–qPCR was conducted using the SimpleChIP enzymatic chromatin IP kit (Cell Signaling Technology, 9002). In brief, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, quenched with 125 mM glycine, washed and sonicated to digest the DNA to an average length of 150–500 bp. Lysates were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 µg of ChIP grade anti-HIF2A antibody (Novus Biologicals, NB100-122) and anti-BMAL1 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 14020), anti-HIF1B antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 5537) or IgG as a negative control. After washing, the antibody–protein–DNA complexes were eluted from the beads. The cross-links were then reversed through overnight incubation at 65 °C, followed by DNA purification. For the qPCR analysis, specific primer pairs were designed to amplify the predicted common binding sequence (CAGGTG) on the human AREG promoter region or E-box regions on the human HIF2A promoter region. The enrichment was quantitatively compared against input controls and IgG negative controls to confirm the specificity of the ChIP-qPCR assay.

HEK293 cell lines (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 2b) overexpressing the pcDNA3-mBmal1 (a gift from A. Sancar, Addgene, 31367)75 were exposed to either normoxia or hypoxia (1% oxygen) for 4 h. In Fig. 3r, HCMs were initially synchronized using dexamethasone (200 nM) for 1 h and then exposed to hypoxia (1% oxygen) for 4 h at CT20 and CT32. After exposure, the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were separately extracted using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78835), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cell lysates were centrifuged and pre-cleared with protein A/G beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 53133) for 1 h with rotation. For the IP, the pre-cleared lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with specific antibodies: mouse anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich, F1804) or rabbit anti-HIF2A (Novus Biologicals, NB100-122) antibodies. Mouse IgG (Cell Signaling Technology, 5415) and rabbit IgG (Abcam, ab172730) were used as isotype controls for the respective antibodies. After the overnight incubation, 40 μl of protein A/G beads were added to each sample, and the incubation was continued for an additional 4 h at 4 °C. The proteins were then eluted using an SDS sample buffer and subjected to heating at 95 °C for 5 min with vigorous shaking. The eluted proteins were subsequently stored at −80 °C for further analysis. In Fig. 2d, HCMs were subjected to hypoxic conditions (1% oxygen) for various durations: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 or 8 h. After each exposure period, HCMs from a single 10-cm dish were lysed using 330 µl of HEPES extraction buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, and a cocktail of protease, phosphatase and RNase inhibitors. Co-IP was then performed according to the previously described protocol. In Extended Data Fig. 7w,x, HEK293 cells were transfected with UB–HA, HIF2A–MYC or BMAL1–Flag expression constructs. To assess the ubiquitination of HIF2A, cells were treated with 10 µM MG132 for 16 h. After treatment, the cells were collected and lysed using HEPES extraction buffer. Immunoprecipitation was then performed using rabbit anti-HIF2A antibodies (Novus, NB100-122) as previously described.

HCMs were transduced with Bmal1-AAV (105 GC per cell) or shBMAL1-AAV (105 GC per cell) and exposed to 1% O2 for 4 h to stabilize HIF1A and HIF2A. After the return to normoxic conditions, CHX (20 μg ml−1, Sigma-Aldrich, C4859) was added to inhibit de novo protein synthesis. Cells were collected at 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after CHX treatment, washed with cold PBS, and lysed in RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After centrifugation, protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay kit. Equal amounts of protein (10–20 μg) were separated by SDS–PAGE and probed with primary antibodies against HIF2A (Novus Biologicals, NB100-122, 1:1,000), HIF1A (Novus Biologicals, NB100-479, 1:1,000), BMAL1 (Cell Signaling Technology, 14020, 1:1,000) and β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, 4967, 1:1,000). The relative protein levels at each timepoint were quantified using ImageJ (NIH, v.2.1.0) and normalized to β-actin as a loading control. For each experimental group, normalized protein levels at 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min were expressed as the percentage of the 0-min timepoint (set as 100%). The degradation rates of the proteins were then plotted as the percentage of remaining protein over time.

Confluent HCMs were subjected to hypoxic conditions (1% oxygen) for various durations (0, 1, 4 or 8 h). After exposure, the cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (Millipore Sigma, P6148), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Amresco, M143), and subjected to a blocking step to reduce non-specific binding. Rabbit anti-BMAL1 (Abcam, ab3350, 1:100), mouse anti-HIF2A (Novus Biologicals, NB100-132, 1:100) and mouse anti-HIF1A (Novus Biologicals, NB100-105, 1:100) were then applied. For PLA, pairs of primary antibodies raised in different species were used as mentioned. After primary antibody incubation, cells were treated with Duolink In Situ PLA Probes (Millipore Sigma, DUO92002 and DUO92004) conjugated to these antibodies. These probes, when in close proximity of less than 40 nm, facilitated the ligation of adjacent oligonucleotides attached to them. Subsequently, the ligated oligonucleotides were amplified and detected using fluorescently labelled probes. The resulting fluorescence signals, which are indicative of PPIs, were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 confocal microscope (Nikon) and analysed with NIS Element AR software (Nikon, v6.10.01). To confirm the specificity of the observed interactions, control experiments were performed using only the BMAL1 antibody.

To overexpress proteins in Escherichia coli, the DNA sequences encoding the N-terminal portions of mouse HIF2A (residues 3–361) and mouse HIF1A (residues 13–357), with a 6×His tag at their N terminus, were inserted into the pET15b vector. The DNA encoding the N-terminal region of mouse BMAL1 protein (residues 68–488), with a C-terminal Flag tag, was ligated into the pET24b vector.

For GST pull-down, the DNA encoding residues 3–361 of mouse HIF2A was inserted into pGEX-6P-1 to generate GST–HIF2A for expression. Six BMAL1 single-site mutants (L95E, L115E, L150E, F248D, R343A and F423D) and three double-site mutants (L95E/L115E, L150E/F248D and R343A/F423D) were generated using site-directed mutagenesis. The DNA sequences of all of the mutants were verified by DNA sequencing.

The recombinant plasmids were individually transformed into E. coli BL21 Rosetta (DE3) or co-transformed together to express either individual proteins or the BMAL1–HIF2A complex. Expression of the proteins or BMAL1–HIF2A complex was carried out at 18 °C by induction with 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 16 h. The BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimer (including bHLH, PAS-A and PAS-B domains) was first purified through a Ni-NTA affinity column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 88222) followed by heparin chromatography. The heterodimer eluted from the heparin column was further analysed by size-exclusion chromatography using the Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column. The peak fractions were assessed using SDS–PAGE and Coomassie blue staining. Subsequently, the samples were combined and concentrated. The concentrated protein was then used for cryo-EM sample preparation or stored at −80 °C for further use. His–HIF2A and His–HIF1A were purified individually using Ni-NTA affinity columns, followed by dialysis to eliminate imidazole. The proteins were concentrated and stored at −80 °C for further use.

To confirm the interaction between BMAL1 and HIF2A or HIF1A in Fig. 2h, BMAL1-expressing cells were lysed using binding buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, and protease inhibitors). After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with anti-Flag M2 beads (Millipore Sigma, A2220) for 40 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, the beads were washed three times using the binding buffer, followed by the addition of purified His–HIF2A or His–HIF1A proteins. After incubation for 40 min at 4 °C, the beads were washed five times using the binding buffer. The proteins bound to beads were then eluted using Flag peptide (0.3 mg ml−1) and further analysed by SDS–PAGE and western blotting using anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich, F1804, 1:1,000) and anti-His (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA1-21315, 1:1,000) antibodies.

To compare the interactions between HIF2A and WT BMAL1 or BMAL1 mutants in Fig. 5e, the cell pellets of GST–HIF2A and GST (as a control) were lysed by sonication in binding buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and protease inhibitors). After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with Glutathione magnetic agarose beads (GE Healthcare, 17-0756-01) for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were subsequently washed three times using the binding buffer, followed by the addition of Flag-tagged WT or mutated BMAL1. After 40 min incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed five times using the binding buffer. The proteins bound to beads were eluted by heating with SDS–PAGE loading dye at 95 °C. The eluted samples were further analysed by SDS–PAGE and western blotting using anti-GST (Genscript, A00865, 1:1,000) and anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich, F1804, 1:1,000) antibodies.

Five fmol of 22-bp biotin-labelled dsDNA fragment containing an HRE consensus sequence was incubated with 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 pmol of purified BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimer in a total volume of 10 µl in 10 mM MES (pH 6.0), 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 2.5% glycerol, 0.05% NP-40 and 5 mM MgCl2. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, the binding reactions were directly loaded onto a native 4–20% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed in 0.5× TBE buffer. DNA on the gel was transferred onto a positively charged nylon membrane and detected using an HRP-conjugated streptavidin with chemiluminescent substrates.

The interaction analysis of the BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimer with 22-bp DNA duplexes (HRE or E-box) was performed using OpenSPR (Nicoya Life Sciences). A 5′-end biotin-labelled dsDNA fragment (2 μM) containing either an HRE or E-box consensus sequence was immobilized in channel 2 of the biotin–streptavidin sensor, while channel 1 remained unmodified and served as a control. The BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimer at various concentrations (from 5 to 50 nM) was injected and flowed slowly at a rate of 20 μl min−1 over the sensor chip for 5 min in a running buffer (20 mM MES pH 5.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, 0.02% BSA). After the injection, a 10-min dissociation phase was collected. The resulting data were analysed using Trace Drawer Kinetic Data Analysis software (v.1.9.2), using a one-to-one model, which assumes one monovalent ligand binding to one target.

To assess the transcriptional activation activity of HIF2A and BMAL1 on the promoter of human AREG, the 3 × 300 bp sequences (−300/0) from the human AREG promoter harbouring the common binding sequence (CAGGTG) were PCR-amplified and cloned into the pEZX-PG04-promoter luciferase vector to generate GLuc-hAREG. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with several constructs: pcDNA3-mHif2a-P405A/P530V/N851A (oxygen-regulation insensitive, a gift from C. Simon, Addgene, 44027)76, pcDNA3-mBmal1 (a gift from A. Sancar, Addgene, 31367)75, hAREG-gluc and SEAP vectors (GeneCopoeia, LF031). Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Invitrogen, L3000015). After 48 h, the culture medium was collected, and the transcriptional activity was quantified using the Secrete-pair Dual Luminescence Assay Kit (GeneCopoeia, LF031) on the Cytation5 (Agilent Technologies) device with Gen5 software (v.3.12, Agilent Technologies). To investigate the transcriptional activity of HIF2A and BMAL1 on a general HIF target gene, HEK293 cells were transfected with the hPGK1-luc reporter (a gift from C. V. Dang, Addgene plasmid, 128095) along with HIF2A or BMAL1 expression constructs. After 48 h of transfection, firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, E1690). The luciferase activity was detected on the Cytation5 (Agilent Technologies) system and analysed using Gen5 software (v.3.12, Agilent Technologies).

On day 1 after MI, collected heart tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and then dehydrated through a graded alcohol series. After dehydration, the tissues were cleared in xylene and embedded in paraffin blocks. Sections of 5–6-μm thickness were prepared and underwent antigen retrieval. These sections were then blocked with diluted donkey serum, followed by overnight incubation with primary antibodies at 4 °C. In the immunofluorescence staining process, a range of primary antibodies was used to specifically target and identify various proteins within the tissue sections. These primary antibodies included: AREG (Santa Cruz, sc-74501, 1:50), HIF2A (Novus Biologicals, NB100-122, 1:200; Novus Biologicals, NB100-132, 1:200), BMAL1 (Abcam, ab3350, 1:200), α-sarcomeric (Abcam, ab137346, 1:200), vimentin (Cell Signaling Technology, 5741, 1:200), and α-smooth muscle actin (Cell Signaling Technology, 19245, 1:200) antibodies. For antigen visualization, the sections were then incubated with Alexa fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Moreover, TUNEL staining was conducted using in situ Click-iT Plus TUNEL assay kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific, C10617) according to the manufacturer's protocol to detect apoptotic cells as previously described77. The samples were counterstained with DAPI (1 μg ml−1, Invitrogen, D3571) and mounted using SlowFade Gold Antifade reagent (Invitrogen, S36936). The stained sections were then imaged with Nikon Eclipse Ti2 confocal microscopy (Nikon) and analysed using ImageJ software (NIH, Fiji v.2.1.0).

Total RNA was extracted from both tissue samples and isolated cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, 74106) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. This procedure is consistent with our established protocols as described in previous publications16,29,50. After the extraction, cDNA was synthesized from the extracted RNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 4368814). qPCR was then performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, 204145). The reactions were performed on the Bio-Rad CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System. For the analysis of gene expression levels, we applied the comparative Ct (ΔΔCt) method. The final data were presented as mean expression ratios relative to β-actin, allowing for the comparison of gene expression across different samples.

Mouse tissues and isolated cells were prepared for western blot analysis by lysing in RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 89900), supplemented with both protease (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78425) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78420). Protein concentrations were quantified, and 10–20 μg of total protein was separated on 4–12% SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories). After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to membranes for immunoblotting. The membranes were probed with the following primary antibodies: anti-HIF1A (Novus, NB100-105, 1:1,000), anti-HIF2A (Novus, NB100-122, 1:1,000), anti-HIF2A (Bethyl Laboratories, A700-003, 1:1,000), anti-HIF1A (Bethyl Laboratories, A700-001, 1:1,000), anti-HIF1B (Cell Signaling Technology, 5537. 1:2,000), anti-BMAL1 (Cell Signaling Technology, 14020, 1:2,000), anti-CLOCK (Cell Signaling Technology, 5157, 1:1,000), anti-RORα (Abcam, ab60134, 1:1,000), anti-AREG (Santa Cruz, sc-74501, 1:1,000), anti-caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9662, 1:1,000), anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9661, 1:1,000), anti-Bax (Cell Signaling Technology, 2772, 1:1,000), anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich, F1804, 1:1,000), anti-ubiquitin (Santa Cruz, sc-8017, 1:1,000), anti-lamin B1 (Cell Signaling Technology, 12586, 1:2,000), anti-lamin A/C (Cell Signaling Technology, 4777, 1:2,000), anti-TBP (Cell Signaling Technology, 8515, 1:1,000), anti-α-tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology, 2144, 1:2,000) and anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz, 47778, 1:2,000). After incubation with secondary antibodies, the membranes were developed using appropriate substrates. The signal intensity was detected and quantified using ImageJ software (NIH, Fiji v.2.1.0). The results were normalized to the appropriate internal control, and data were expressed as the relative fold changes in protein levels.

The purified BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimer was mixed with a twofold molar excess of the HRE dsDNA, followed by incubation on ice for 20 min. The mixture was then applied onto the Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column. The eluate fractions from the column were analysed by SDS–PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue. The peak fractions corresponding to the BMAL1–HIF2A–DNA complex were combined and concentrated to 0.5 mg ml−1 for preparing cryo-EM specimens. In brief, 3 μl of the purified complex was applied onto freshly glow-discharged R 2/1 holey carbon 300 mesh copper grids (C-flat). The grids were then vitrified in liquid ethane using an FEI Vitrobot (Mark IV).

Single-particle cryo-EM images were collected using the FEI Titan Krios (300 KV) electron microscope with a Gatan GIF Quantum K2 direct electron detector. The images were automatically acquired using EPU (Thermo Fisher Scientific, v.2.10) at underfocus values ranging from 1.0 to 2.5 μm with a pixel size of 0.85 Å px−1. Each micrograph was exposed for 9 s with a total dose of about 75 e− Å−2, which was fractionated into 45 frames. The movie frames were aligned using MotionCor2 (v.1.4.0)78, resulting in a total of 18,039 micrographs. Gctf (v.1.18)79 was used to estimate the parameters of contrast transfer function (CTF) for each micrograph. crYOLO (v.1.10)80 was used for reference-free automatic particle picking, yielding a total of approximately 710,000 particles. The particles were extracted with a box size of 352. Multiple rounds of Cryosparc (v.-2.5)81 2D classification were initially performed to remove junk particles. Next, the remaining particles were subjected to an additional round of 2D classification using RELION (v.3.1)82, yielding a stack of 420,000 particles. An ab initio model, showing secondary structural features bound to DNA, was generated using CryoSPARC and then used as a reference for subsequent 3D analysis. Multiple rounds of 3D classification were performed in RELION, resulting in 141,218 particles. The particles were rescaled to a pixel size of 1.02 Å px−1 with a box size of 328 pixels and subsequently subjected to 3D refinement. The reference map for 3D refinement was filtered to 25 Å, and a low-pass filtered mask at 25 Å was generated using a threshold that included the protein and DNA regions, followed by a 4-pixel dilation and 5-pixel soft padding. 3D refinement in RELION produced a 4.7 Å-resolution map of the BMAL1–HIF2A–DNA complex. Next, these particles were further processed by CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing in RELION, resulting in 141,218 shiny particles. These particles were then subjected to 3D refinement, producing a map with a resolution of 4.3 Å. Multiple rounds of 3D classification, with and without alignment, were then conducted. A final set of 43,098 shiny particles was used for 3D refinement, resulting in a map with an average resolution of 3.6 Å. The resolution was calculated using a low-pass filtered mask at 15 Å, created with a threshold of 0.008, a 3-pixel dilation and 3-pixel soft padding. The b-factor for the RELION map was −61. The final map was sharpened using DeepEMhancer (v.0.14) with the wideTarget training mode83. The local resolutions were calculated using CryoSPARC. The resolutions of the 3D maps were estimated using gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) curves with a 0.143 cut-off criteria84. The directional resolution anisotropy was quantified by the 3D FSC algorithm (v.3.0)85. The final set of 43,098 particles had an Eod value of 0.74 with the best and worst PSF resolutions of 2.8 and 5.3 Å, respectively, as calculated by cryoEF (v.1.1.0)86, indicating minor anisotropy. The cryo-EM data collection and image analysis procedures are shown in Supplementary Table 11 and Extended Data Fig. 9, respectively.

To build an atomic model of the BMAL1–HIF2A–DNA complex, the crystal structure of HIF2A (Protein Data Bank (PDB): 4ZP4) and a 22-bp B-form DNA duplex were used as templates and fitted into the deepEMhancer map of BMAL1–HIF2A–DNA by rigid-body fitting in Chimera (v.1.15)87. Owing to the structural arrangement, the bHLH, PAS-A and PAS-B domains of the BMAL1 crystal structure (PDB: 4F3L) were individually fitted into the map. The model was then manually built and adjusted in Coot (v.1.1)88, followed by real-space refinement in Phenix (v.1.21)89 (Supplementary Table 11). In the final BMAL1–HIF2A–DNA atomic model, amino acids for HIF2A (3–12, 76–88, 151–163, 174–185, 201–219 and 356–361) and BMAL1 (68–74, 102–110, 126–144, 164–167, 210–242, 254–279, 291–311, 321–337, 345–349, 407–412 and 441–488) as well as a four DNA bases near the terminal ends were not built because of missing or poor densities. The refined model statics are shown in Supplementary Table 11. All molecular graphic figures were generated by Chimera, ChimeraX (v.1.7)90 and PyMOL (v.2.5.5)91.

Unless otherwise specified, all results are presented as the mean ± s.e.m., with the precise number of biological replicates (n) described in the figure legends. All data were plotted from independent biological replicates. The Shapiro–Wilk normality test was used to assess normal distribution. The equality of variances for unpaired t-tests was determined using the F-test. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 10.0, using unpaired t-tests (two-tailed), Welch's t-tests (for unequal variances), Mann–Whitney U-tests (when normality assumptions were not met) or one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's multiple-comparison analysis, depending on the dataset. Outliers were identified using the ROUT method (Q = 1%) in GraphPad Prism. For ChIP–qPCR data analysis in Fig. 3s, values identified as outliers were excluded from the statistical analysis. Cardiac function assessment in Bmal1loxP/loxP myosin-Cre+, Hif2aloxP/loxP myosin-Cre+ and Hif1aloxP/loxP myosin-Cre+ mice was compared to a shared myosin-Cre+ control group. Cardiac function data from Bmal1loxP/loxP myosin-Cre+ mice were used as the control for comparing NOB-treated Bmal1loxP/loxP myosin-Cre+ mice. Similarly, cardiac function data from Areg−/− mice were used as the control for comparing NOB-treated Areg−/− mice. Cardiac function data from C57BL/6J mice were partially used as the control group for Areg−/− mice. This strategy minimized animal use and ensured a consistent baseline, optimizing research efficiency while enabling reliable comparative analysis.

Metrics details

Understanding the human de novo mutation (DNM) rate requires complete sequence information1. Here using five complementary short-read and long-read sequencing technologies, we phased and assembled more than 95% of each diploid human genome in a four-generation, twenty-eight-member family (CEPH 1463). We estimate 98–206 DNMs per transmission, including 74.5 de novo single-nucleotide variants, 7.4 non-tandem repeat indels, 65.3 de novo indels or structural variants originating from tandem repeats, and 4.4 centromeric DNMs. Among male individuals, we find 12.4 de novo Y chromosome events per generation. Short tandem repeats and variable-number tandem repeats are the most mutable, with 32 loci exhibiting recurrent mutation through the generations. We accurately assemble 288 centromeres and six Y chromosomes across the generations and demonstrate that the DNM rate varies by an order of magnitude depending on repeat content, length and sequence identity. We show a strong paternal bias (75–81%) for all forms of germline DNM, yet we estimate that 16% of de novo single-nucleotide variants are postzygotic in origin with no paternal bias, including early germline mosaic mutations. We place all this variation in the context of a high-resolution recombination map (~3.4 kb breakpoint resolution) and find no correlation between meiotic crossover and de novo structural variants. These near-telomere-to-telomere familial genomes provide a truth set to understand the most fundamental processes underlying human genetic variation.

The telomere-to-telomere (T2T) assembly of a human genome1 added an estimated 8% of the most repeat-rich DNA, including regions typically excluded from studies of human genetic variation, such as centromeres2, segmental duplications (SDs)3 and acrocentric regions1,4. Long-read sequencing (LRS) of many phased human diploid genomes has already begun to offer insights into mutational mechanisms5,6,7, opening up the discovery of all forms of variation irrespective of class or complexity8,9. Direct comparison of parental genomes to their offspring increases the power to identify DNMs as opposed to mapping reads to an intermediate reference, such as GRCh38 or T2T-CHM13 (ref. 10).

The goal of this study was to construct a high-quality human pedigree resource whereby chromosomes were fully assembled and phased, and their transmission was studied intergenerationally to enhance our understanding of both recombination and DNM processes. We sought to eliminate three ascertainment biases with respect to discovery, including biases to specific genomic regions, classes of genetic variation and reference genome effects. To achieve this, we focused on the four-generation, 28-member family CEPH 1463. This family has been intensively studied over the past three decades11, and we sequenced the family members using five sequencing technologies with distinct and complementary error modalities. This particular pedigree has served as a benchmark for early linkage mapping studies11,12 using short-read sequencing (SRS)13 and continues to serve as reference for understanding human variation, including patterns of mosaicism14,15.

Just as the initial T2T genome1 served as a reference for understanding all regions of the genome, our objective was to create a reference truth set for both inherited and de novo variation.

We generated PacBio high-fidelity (HiFi), ultra-long Oxford Nanopore Technologies (UL-ONT), Strand-seq, Illumina and Element AVITI Biosciences (Element) whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data for most of the 28 members from a four-generation family (CEPH 1463 pedigree) (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1).

Twenty-eight members of the four-generation pedigree CEPH 1463 were sequenced using five orthogonal next-generation and LRS platforms: HiFi sequencing, Illumina and Element sequencing were performed on peripheral blood for G2–G4, and UL-ONT and Strand-seq data were generated on available lymphoblastoid cell lines for G1–G3. The pedigree dataset has been expanded to include the fourth generation and G3 spouses (200080 and 200100).

For the purpose of variant discovery, we focused on generating long-read PacBio, short-read Illumina and Element data from blood-derived DNA to avoid cell-line-specific artefacts. We also used the corresponding cell lines to generate UL-ONT reads to construct near-T2T assemblies as well as Strand-seq data to detect large polymorphic inversions and evaluate assembly accuracy (Methods and Supplementary Table 2). In brief, we generated deep WGS data from multiple orthogonal sequencing platforms, focusing primarily on the first three generations (G1–G3) (Extended Data Fig. 1a), and used the fourth generation (G4) to validate de novo germline variants. We applied two hybrid genome assembly pipelines, Verkko16 and hifiasm17, to generate highly contiguous, phased genome assemblies for G1–G3, while G4 members were assembled using HiFi data only (Methods).

In summary, Verkko assemblies are the most contiguous (AuN (similar to average contig length measure): 102 Mb) (Extended Data Fig. 1b, Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 and Supplementary Note 8) and we estimate that 63.3% (319 out of 504) of chromosomes across G1–G3 are near-T2T (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Moreover, 42.3% (213 out of 504) of non-acrocentric chromosomes are spanned in a single contig with canonical telomere repeats at each end (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 3). We sequenced and assembled 288 centromeres (44.7%, 288 out of 644) across G1–G3 and note that different assemblers preferentially assembled different human centromeres (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 4). Both the sequence (QV range, 47–58) and phasing accuracy are high (Methods, Supplementary Figs. 5–12 and Supplementary Table 4).

This data resource enables us to track the inheritance of any genomic segment and associated variants across all four generations (Extended Data Fig. 2a). We identified a total of 5.95 million single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels and 35,662 structural variants (SVs)—all of which are Mendelian consistent across the second and third generations (Methods, Supplementary Table 5, Supplementary Fig. 13 and Data availability)18. Of the 5.95 million, 77% of small variants are supported by all three technologies, with variant calling from primary material helping to eliminate DNMs arising from cell line artefacts (Supplementary Note 1). LRS provides access to an additional approximately 260 Mb of the human genome (2.77 Gb) in contrast to the Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) (2.51 Gb)19 or Illumina WGS (2.58 Gb)13 data, including 201 Mb not present in either study. Some of the largest gains occur among SDs and their associated genes. We classified 85.5% (6,883 out of 8,048 merged SDs) of the SDs (coverage, >95%) as high confidence in comparison to 25.6% (2,060 out of 8,048 merged SDs) in the previous GIAB analysis, a major improvement for these highly copy-number variable regions20. We find that the majority (>91%) of known copy-number variable regions were stably transmitted in this pedigree, while the remaining 9% were often flagged as potentially misassembled (Supplementary Note 2). Similarly, we provide a comprehensive census of mobile element insertions (Methods, Supplementary Table 6, Supplementary Fig. 14 and Supplementary Note 3) and identify 120 inversions segregating in a Mendelian manner (21 were ambiguous) (Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Figs. 15–18). The latter includes a rare inversion (~703 kb) overlapping a disease-associated copy-number variable region at chromosome 15q25.2 (ref. 21) (Supplementary Fig. 19) and an inverted duplication (~295 kb) at chromosome 16q11.2 (Supplementary Fig. 20).

Using three different approaches13,22 (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 2b), we identify 539 meiotic breakpoints in G3 (n = 8) with respect to T2T-CHM13, with 99.8% (538 out of 539) supported by more than one approach (Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Fig. 21). From an initial resolution of around 3.4 kb, we further refined 90.4% (487 out of 539) of the breakpoints to a median size of about 2.5 kb based on direct genome comparisons between parent and a child (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 22). Notably, 191 breakpoints actually increase in size as a result of reference biases in T2T-CHM13 (Supplementary Fig. 23). We distinguish recombination breakpoints with very sharp transition between parental haplotypes from those with an extended region of homology at both parental haplotypes (Extended Data Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 24). We also characterize 78 smaller haplotype segment ‘switches' in G3 (median size of ~1 kb)23,24,25 that would be consistent with either a double crossover or an allelic gene conversion event, although this is probably an underestimate due to our strict filtering criteria (Methods, Supplementary Table 9 and Supplementary Fig. 25). Extending recombination mapping to G4 chromosomes, we add 964 breakpoints for a total of 1,503 meiotic breakpoints across 22 transmissions (Supplementary Fig. 26). This includes 16 recombination hotspots, 11 of which are consistent with previously reported increased recombination rates26 (Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Fig. 27).

Overall, 15–20% of paternal and maternal homologues are transmitted without a detectable meiotic breakpoint (that is, non-recombinant chromosomes) (Supplementary Fig. 28). We observe a significant excess (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P = 6.4 × 10−5) of maternal recombination events with expected maternal to paternal breakpoint ratio of 1.4 (ref. 27) (Supplementary Fig. 29). Paternal recombination is significantly biased towards the ends of human chromosomes with 55 paternal recombination events mapping to within 2 Mb of the telomere in comparison to 1 event in female individuals27,28,29 (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 30). In G2–G3, we observed a decrease in crossover events with advancing parental age for both male and female germlines (Extended Data Fig. 2d). We modelled this observation across G1–G4 using a Poisson generalized linear model (GLM) with a log link and continued to observe a significant decrease in recombination breakpoints as a function of parental age and sex (P = 7.17 × 10−3 and 1.22 × 10−9 for parental age and sex, respectively; Poisson GLM with a log link, AIC = 284.2) (Supplementary Fig. 31). Although there is no known biological mechanism that would lead to a decrease in both parental germlines, this observation runs counter to a population-level analysis based on SRS data25,30,31. We consider this observation to be preliminary until a larger number of families is analysed.

To discover small variants, we examined HiFi reads aligned to T2T-CHM13, then used orthogonal ONT and Illumina data to confirm that a variant is in fact present in a sample and absent from parents (Methods). This strategy reduces platform bias but restricts DNM discovery to G2 (n = 2) and G3 (n = 8) individuals, as ONT data were not generated for G4. Our de novo callset included 755 SNVs and 73 indels across the autosomes (Fig. 2a), and 27 SNVs and 1 indel on the X chromosome. We used flanking SNVs to construct haplotypes, phase variants and trace a mutation back either to a parental gamete or the early embryo. We determined that a mutation occurred somatically, and probably early in embryonic development, if it met one of two criteria: it was incompletely linked to a parental haplotype (n = 122) or, if it could not be phased, it had an allele balance significantly less than 0.5 across all three sequencing platforms (n = 7) (Fig. 2b), which was further confirmed using Element data (Supplementary Fig. 32). Moreover, we validated each postzygotic mutation (PZM) by tracing its haplotype backwards across generations and forwards for the four individuals with sequenced offspring (Supplementary Note 4).

TR DNMs (<50 bp) are shown for G3 only because they have greater parental sequencing depth and we can assess transmission (Methods). The hatched bars show the number of SNVs confirmed as transmitting to the next generation. b, Germline SNVs (n = 626) have a mean allele balance of near 0.50 across the sequencing platforms, while the mean postzygotic SNV (n = 119) allele balance is less than 0.25. The box plots show the median (centre line), the interquartile range (IQR) (box limits) and the whiskers extend to 25% − 1.5 × IQR and 75% + 1.5 × IQR; outliers are shown as dots. c, A strong paternal age effect is observed for germline de novo SNVs (+1.55 DNMs per year; two-sided t-test, P = 0.013) but not for PZMs (P = 0.72). We observe no significant maternal age effect for DNMs (+0.20 DNMs per year, P = 0.54) or PZMs (P = 0.74). The solid lines are regression lines that were fitted using a linear model function; the surrounding shaded areas represent their 95% confidence intervals. d, The estimated SNV DNM rate by region of the genome shows a significant excess of DNM for large repeat regions, including centromeres and SDs. Assembly-based DNM calls on the centromeres and Y chromosome (chr.) show an excess of DNM in the satellite DNA. A significant difference from the autosomal DNM or PZM rate was determined using two-sided t-tests; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.001. P values for each comparison are as follows: 0.0066 (alignment-based DNMs in SDs), 0.049 (alignment-based PZMs in SDs), 0.017 (alignment-based DNMs in centromeres), 0.34 (alignment-based PZMs in centromeres), 0.13 (assembly-based DNMs in centromeric flanking regions), 0.14 (assembly-based DNMs in centromeric HORs), 0.59 (assembly-based DNMs in chromosome Y euchromatic regions) and 0.00025 (assembly-based DNMs in Yq12).

Of the 62 PZMs in these four samples, 64.5% (n = 40) are transmitted to the next generation, compared with 97.2% of germline SNVs (242 out of 249) and 100% of indels (Extended Data Fig. 3). We found that 10 PZMs failed these haplotype-based validations, resulting in a final callset of 119 PZMs, accounting for 16% of total autosomal SNVs (745 de novo SNVs). Previous Illumina-based analysis of this family14 identified 605 de novo SNVs of either germline (G2 and G3) or postzygotic (only G2) origin, 92.4% (n = 559) of which were represented in our final callset, while all but four of the absent variants failed validation with long-read data. We were able to identify an additional 72 PZMs in G3 for the first time, including a total of 186 novel DNMs, a 6.1% and 21% increase in germline SNV and indel discovery, respectively.

In total, 81.4% of germline small DNMs originate on paternal haplotypes (4.38:1 paternal:maternal ratio, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P < 2 × 10−16), with a significant parental age effect of 1.55 germline DNMs per additional year of paternal age when fitting with linear regression (two-sided t-test, P = 0.013). By contrast, PZMs show no significant difference with respect to parental origin (1.38:1 paternal:maternal ratio, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P = 0.09) and no parental age effects (Fig. 2c). Although our small sample size does not provide sufficient power to detect significant differences between the de novo and postzygotic mutational spectra (Supplementary Fig. 33a), we do observe a novel depletion of CpG>TpG PZMs (χ2 test, P = 0.17) and an enrichment of postzygotic T>A substitutions (χ2 test, P = 0.268) that has been previously observed14.

We successfully assayed 91.9% of the autosomal genome (2.66 Gb) (Supplementary Fig. 33b and Supplementary Note 4). Excluding all variants classified as postzygotic, we find that the parental germline contributes 1.17 × 10−8 SNVs per bp per generation (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08 × 10−8–1.27 × 10−8). De novo SNVs are significantly enriched in repetitive sequences, as much as 2.8-fold in centromeres (95% CI = 1.79 × 10−8–5.51 × 10−8 SNVs per bp per generation, two-sided t-test, P = 0.017) and 1.9-fold in SDs (95% CI = 1.64 × 10−8–2.88 × 10−8 SNVs per bp per generation, two-sided t-test, P = 0.0066) (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 33c and Supplementary Table 10). We observed a lower PZM rate of 2.04 × 10−9 SNVs per bp per generation (95% CI = 1.68 × 10−9–2.47 × 10−9) across the autosomes, yet we see a 3.9-fold enrichment of PZMs in SDs (95% CI = 4.84 × 10−9–1.25 × 10−8 SNVs per bp per generation, two-sided t-test, P = 0.049). Among PZMs transmitted to the next generation (n = 33 PZMs across four samples), we observe a 2.69-fold enrichment in SDs (95% CI = 1.15 × 10−9–1.08 × 10−8 SNVs per bp per generation) that does not reach significance owing to the small sample size (two-sided t-test, P = 0.218).

Here we investigate tandem repeats (TRs), including short TRs (STRs, 1–6 bp motifs) and variable-number TRs (VNTRs, 7–1,000 bp motifs). We successfully genotyped 7.68 million out of 7.82 million TR loci (Methods) on HiFi data using the Tandem Repeat Genotyping Tool (TRGT)32, across all members of the pedigree. Of those, 7.17 million (93.4%) loci were completely Mendelian concordant across all trios. We used TRGT-denovo to identify candidate DNMs at loci that were covered by at least 10 HiFi reads across all members of a given trio; on average, 6.88 million TR loci met this criterion33. We refined these putative DNMs through orthogonal sequencing and transmission (Methods). Element sequencing, generated from blood DNA, exhibits substantially lower error rates following homopolymer tracts34, so we tested whether it could more accurately measure the length of homopolymers and other TR alleles. We observed low stutter in the Element data at homopolymers; across a random sample of 1,000 homozygous homopolymer loci called by TRGT, an average of 99.5% of Element reads perfectly support the TRGT-genotyped allele size in GRCh38, compared to 93.5% of Illumina sequencing reads (Supplementary Figs. 34 and 35).

We used the Element data to further validate de novo TR alleles called by TRGT-denovo. Owing to the short read length of Element data, we could assess only 80 out of 613 (13.1%) de novo STR alleles (average of 10 STRs per sample). We considered a DNM validated if Element reads supported the TRGT allele size in the child and did not support it in either parent (allowing for off-by-one base-pair errors; Methods). Of the 80 de novo STRs that we could assess, 56 (70%) passed our strict consistency criteria. The validation rate was lower at homopolymers (3 out of 20; 15%) than at non-homopolymers (53 out of 60; 88.3%), indicating that our estimates of mutation rates at homopolymers may be less precise. Using pedigree information, we required that candidate de novo TR alleles observed in the two G3 individuals with sequenced children (NA12879 and NA12886) be transmitted to at least one child in the subsequent generation (G4). Of the 128 de novo TR alleles observed in the two G3 individuals, 96 (75%) were transmitted to the next generation, which is significantly lower than de novo SNVs reflecting the challenges that still remain in accurately characterizing de novo TRs.

After Element and transmission validation, we found an average of 65.3 TR DNMs (including STRs, VNTRs and complex loci) per sample and estimated a TR DNM rate of 4.74 × 10−6 per locus per haplotype per generation (95% CI = 4.06 × 10−6–5.43 × 10−6), with substantial variation across repeat motif sizes (Fig. 3a). Collectively, TR DNMs inserted or deleted a mean of 978 bp per sample or 15.0 bp per event (Supplementary Table 10). An average of 54.9 mutations were expansions or contractions of STR motifs, 2.6 affected VNTR motifs and 7.8 affected ‘complex' loci comprising both STR and VNTR motifs. The STR mutation rate was 5.50 × 10−6 DNMs per locus per haplotype per generation (95% CI = 5.0 × 10−6–6.04 × 10−6). The VNTR mutation rate was 0.83 × 10−6 (95% CI = 0.51 × 10−6–1.27 × 10−6), predominantly comprising loci that could not be assessed in SRS studies. Several previous estimates of the genome-wide STR mutation rate considered only polymorphic STR loci; when we limited our analysis to STR loci that were polymorphic in the CEPH 1463 pedigree, we found 5.98 × 10−5 de novo STR events per locus per generation (95% CI = 5.43–6.57 × 10−5), which is broadly consistent with previous estimates of 4.95 × 10−5–5.6 × 10−5 (refs. 35,36,37). Overall, 75.0% of phased de novo TR alleles were paternal in origin (Fig. 3b). The mutation rate for dinucleotide motifs was higher than for homopolymers, and we observed an increasing mutation rate with motif size for motifs greater than 6 bp in length (Fig. 3a). As reported in previous studies35, larger TR loci (defined as the total length of the TR locus in the reference genome sequence) exhibited higher mutation rates (Supplementary Fig. 36a). We did not observe a significant bias towards expansions or contractions (two-sided binomial test, P = 0.19) (Supplementary Fig. 36b).

a, TR DNM rates (mutations per haplotype per locus per generation) are displayed for each TR class (STR, VNTR or complex) as a function of the minimum motif size observed at each TR locus (n = 522) in the T2T-CHM13 reference genome (blue; left y axis).The average number of loci of each motif size that passed filtering criteria in each individual are displayed in grey (right y axis). The error bars denote the 95% Poisson CIs (computed using a χ2 distribution) around the mean mutation rate estimate. The mutation rates include all non-recurrent calls that pass TRGT-denovo filtering criteria and Element consistency analysis. b, The inferred parent-of-origin for confidently phased TR DNMs in G3. The hatching indicates transmission to at least one G4 child, where available. c, Pedigree overview of a recurrent VNTR locus at chromosome 8: 2376919–2377075 (T2T-CHM13) with motif composition GAGGCGCCAGGAGAGAGCGCT(n)ACGGG(n). Allele colouring indicates inheritance patterns as determined by inheritance vectors, with grey representing unavailable data. The symbols denote inheritance type relative to the inherited parental allele: plus (+) for de novo expansion and minus (−) for de novo contraction, shown only for the mutating alleles; the numbers indicate allele lengths in bp. De novo TR alleles are present in seven out of eight G3 individuals and transmit to four G4 individuals, with two expanding further after transmission. The spouse of a G3 individual (200080) carries a distinct TR allele that undergoes a de novo contraction in subsequent transmissions. d, Read-level evidence for the recurrent DNM in c, represented as vertical lines, obtained from individual sequencing reads, shown per sample. Where available, both HiFi (top) and ONT (bottom) sequencing reads are displayed. Colouring is consistent with the inheritance patterns in c; the outlined boxes with plus or minus markers highlight DNMs.

We identified a subset of TR loci that were recurrently mutated among members of the pedigree. We identified a high-confidence set of 32 loci (Methods and Supplementary Table 11): five showing intragenerational recurrence (observed DNMs in at least two G3 individuals) and 27 loci with intergenerational recurrence (observed DNMs in at least two generations). As they are observed only in a single generation, the five intragenerational DNMs may represent mosaicism in the parental germline, rather than recurrent mutational events. Notably, we observed three or more distinct de novo expansions or contractions at 16 of the loci that exhibited recurrence (Extended Data Table 1). As an example, we highlight an intergenerational recurrently mutated TR locus with ten unique de novo expansions and/or contractions (Fig. 3c,d). All allele transmissions are fully consistent with the inheritance vectors (Supplementary Note 5) and are supported by both HiFi and ONT reads.

Among the 288 completely assembled centromeres, we assessed 150 intergenerational transmissions (Fig. 4a). Comparing these assembled centromeres between parent and child, we identify 18 (12%) de novo SVs validated by both ONT and HiFi data with roughly equivalent numbers of insertions and deletions (Fig. 4b and Methods). All de novo SVs (n = 8) that had a child sequenced as part of this study confirmed transmission to the next generation (Supplementary Table 10). We find that 72.2% (13 out of 18) of SVs map to α-satellite higher-order repeat (HOR) arrays (Extended Data Fig. 4a) with the remainder (5 out of 18, 27.8%) corresponding to various pericentromeric flanking sequences but not flanking monomeric α-satellites. All α-satellite HOR de novo SV events involve integer changes in the basic α-satellite HOR cassettes specific to each centromere and range in size from 680 bp (one 4-mer α-satellite HOR on chromosome 9) to 12,228 bp (four 18-mer α-satellite HORs on chromosome 6) (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 4b). One transmission from chromosome 9 involves both a gain of 2,052 bp (six dimer α-satellite HOR units) and a loss of 1,710 bp (one 4-mer α-satellite HOR and three α-satellite dimer units) in a single G2-to-G3 transmission (Fig. 4d–f). The chromosome 6 centromere has the most recurrent structural events, with three being observed across three generations (Fig. 4a). The chromosome 6 centromere has the greatest number of nearly perfectly identical (>99.9%) α-satellite HORs (Extended Data Fig. 4c).

The coloured arrows at the top of each haplotype show the α-satellite HOR structure. g, Example of two de novo deletions in the chromosome 21 centromere of G2-NA12877. The deletions reside within a hypomethylated region of the centromeric α-satellite HOR array, known as the CDR, which is thought to be the site of kinetochore assembly. The deletion of three α-satellite HORs within the CDR results in a shift of the CDR by around 260 kb in G2-NA12877.

We also assessed 18 SV events for their potential effect on the hypomethylation pocket associated with the centromere dip region (CDR)—a marker of the site of kinetochore attachment38,39 (Methods). We find that 11 SVs mapping outside of the CDR have a marginal effect on changing the centre point of the CDR (<100 kb) from one generation to another (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e), while SVs mapping within the CDR have a more marked effect (average shift of around 260 kb) and/or they completely alter the distribution of the CDR (Fig. 4g and Extended Data Fig. 4f,g). Although follow-up experiments using CENP-A chromatin immunoprecipitation–sequencing are needed to confirm the actual binding site of the kinetochore, these findings suggest that structural mutations may have epigenetic consequences in changing the position of kinetochore.

Finally, using 31 parent–child transmissions of centromeres (150.5 Mb), we identify 16 SNV DNMs in centromeres, including five within the α-satellite HOR arrays, for a DNM rate of 1.01 × 10−7 mutations per bp per generation (95% CI = 5.75 × 10−8–1.63 × 10−7). This rate is comparable to the rate from our read-based mapping approach, which identified 14 centromeric SNVs, albeit over more than 10 times the amount of sequence, resulting in a DNM rate of 3.27 × 10−8 mutations per bp per generation (95% CI = 1.79 × 10−8–5.51 × 10−8) (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 10). By combining the data, we estimate a significantly higher SNV DNM rate for centromeres of 4.94 × 10−8 (two-sided t-test, P = 0.017). We believe that this is a conservative estimate because we required validation of all events by both the ONT and HiFi sequencing platforms.

There are nine male members who carry the R1b1a-Z302 Y haplogroup across the four generations (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 12) and we use the great-grandfather (G1-NA12889; Fig. 1) Y-chromosome assembly as a reference for DNM detection across 48.8 Mb of the male-specific Y-chromosomal region (MSY) (Methods and Supplementary Note 6). The de novo assembly-based approach increases by more than twofold the number of accessible base pairs when compared to HiFi read-based calling but increases by more than sevenfold the discovery of de novo SNVs. In total, we identify 48 de novo SNVs in the MSY across the 5 G2–G3 male individuals, ranging from 7 to 11 SNVs per Y transmission (mean, 9.6; median, 10) (Supplementary Table 13). Only 2 SNVs map to the Y euchromatic regions, 1 to the pericentromeric regions and the remaining 45 out of 48 map to the Yq12 heterochromatic satellite regions (Fig. 5b). In total, we estimate a de novo SNV rate of 1.99 × 10−7 mutations per bp per generation (95% CI = 1.59 × 10−7–2.39 × 10−7) for the entire MSY. This estimate is an order of magnitude higher than that previously reported for Y euchromatic regions40 due to access to Yq12 satellite DNA (Supplementary Table 13). We note that 13 out of 45 (29%) of the DNMs had 100% identical matches elsewhere in the Yq12 region (but not at orthologous positions) and probably result from interlocus gene conversion events within the DYZ1/DYZ2 repeats41 (Methods). We also identify a total of nine de novo indels (<50 bp, homopolymers excluded) ranging from 1–3 indels per sample (mean, 1.8 events per Y transmission) and five de novo SVs (≥50 bp) (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 13). The latter range from 2,416 to 4,839 bp in size, each affecting an entire DYZ2 repeat unit(s), with an average of one SV per Y transmission. All applicable DNMs (SNVs, n = 20 out of 48; indels, n = 6 out of 9; SVs, n = 4 out of 5) are concordant with the expected transmission through generations (that is, from G2 to G3–G4 and from G3-NA12866 to his three male descendants in G4) (Fig. 5b). Overall, 82% (51 out of 62) of the DNMs identified on chromosome Y (42 out of 48 SNVs; 4 out of 9 of indels; and 5 out of 5 SVs) are located in regions where short reads cannot be reliably mapped (mapping quality = 0).

In total, we validated 41 de novo SVs across eight individuals (G3), including 16 insertions and 25 deletions (Methods) of which 68% (28 out of 41) originate in the paternal germline with a trend towards an increase in SVs with paternal age (Supplementary Fig. 37). Almost all SVs (40 out of 41) correspond to TRs, including mutation in centromeres, Y chromosome satellites and clustered SDs (Supplementary Table 10). We estimate around 5 SVs (95% CI = 3–7) per transmission affecting approximately 4.4 kb of DNA (median, 4,875 bp). If we exclude de novo SVs mapping to the centromere and Y chromosomes (n = 14), the median size of the events drops by an order of magnitude (median, 362 bp). Non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) has frequently been invoked as a mechanism to underlie TR expansions and contractions42,43. However, we find that none of the 27 euchromatic de novo SVs coincide with recombination crossovers (Supplementary Fig. 37e). This argues against NAHR between homologous chromosomes during meiosis I as the primary mechanism for their origin, although we cannot preclude other mechanisms associated with double-stranded breaks not involving recombination. We identify one retrotransposition event: a full-length (3,407 bp long) de novo insertion of an SVA element (SVAF subfamily) (G3-NA12887)44 with the predicted donor mapping around 23 Mb upstream (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 38). This insertion is present at a low frequency (around 11% of reads) in the parent (G2-NA12878) but not in the grandparental transmitting haplotype, consistent with a germline mosaic event arising in G2 postzygotically (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 39).

Most DNM studies40,45,46,47,48,49 are based on SRS data from large groups of trios and converge on around 60–70 DNMs per generation; however, these studies often exclude highly mutable regions of the genome7. Our multiplatform and multigenerational, assembly-based approach provides access to some of the most repetitive regions, such as centromeres and heterochromatic regions on the Y chromosome. The use of parental references in addition to the standard references and the ability to confirm transmissions across subsequent generations improves both sensitivity and specificity. In this multigenerational pedigree, we estimate a range of 98–206 DNMs per transmission (average of 152 per generation) and observe a strong paternal de novo bias (70–80%) and an increase with advancing paternal age, not only for SNVs but also for indels and SVs, including TRs.

The rate of de novo SNVs varies by more than an order of magnitude depending on the genomic context, consistent with recent human population-based analyses7,50 and theoretical predictions51. SD regions show an 88% increase (2.2 × 10−8 (95% CI = 1.64 × 10−8–2.88 × 10−8) versus 1.17 × 10−8). This is driven by SDs with >95% identity. We also observe a significant decrease in the de novo transition/transversion ratio compared with the genome (χ2 test, P = 0.0109) as predicted7 (Supplementary Note 7). We estimate that satellite DNA in the Yq12 heterochromatic region41,52 is at least 30 times more mutable than autosomal euchromatin (3.86 × 10−7 mutations per bp per generation). It is composed of thousands of short satellite DNA repeats (DYZ1/Hsat3A6 and DYZ2/Hsat1B) organized into Mb blocks that are >98% identical41,52. This, along with the fact that 29% of mutational changes match to non-orthologous sites in Yq12, is consistent with ‘interlocus gene conversion' driving this >20-fold excess, potentially as a result of increased sister chromatid exchange events41.

Previous studies predicted that 6–10% of DNMs are not germline in origin, but instead arise sometime after fertilization, giving rise to a mosaic variant14,53. This distinction has been based on allele balance thresholds53 or incomplete linkage to nearby SNVs across three generations14. LRS increases sensitivity by assigning nearly every de novo SNV to a parental haplotype and define PZM by its incomplete linkage to that haplotype. We classify 16% of de novo SNVs as postzygotic in origin (n = 119 PZMs/745 de novo SNVs). As all sequencing data in this study are derived from blood, we cannot demonstrate that every PZM is present in multiple tissues, but we can use transmission to the next generation as a proxy, as it reveals that the mutation is also present in germ cells. PZMs account for 12% of all SNVs transmitted to the next generation (n = 33 PZMs/275 transmitted SNVs), an increase over previous estimates. Early cell divisions of human embryos are frequently error prone54,55 with an accelerated rate of cell division potentially contributing to the large fraction of PZMs with high (>25%) allele balance. Such events would previously have been classified as germline but, consistent with PZM expectations, we find no paternal bias associated with these DNMs (Fig. 2c).

TRs are among the most mutable loci of our genome36,56,57, with the number of such de novo events comparable to germline SNVs58 but affecting more than an order of magnitude more base pairs per generation. We find a threefold differential in TR DNM rate with increasing repeat number and motif length generally correlating with mutation rate. However, we observe an apparent mutation rate trough between dinucleotides and larger motif lengths (>10 bp) (Fig. 3b), which may reflect different mutational mechanisms based on locus size, motif length and complexity. For example, larger TR motifs may be more likely to mutate through NAHR, synthesis-dependent strand annealing or interlocus gene conversion while mutational events at STRs may be biased toward traditional replication-based slippage mutational mechanisms42,43. Consistent with some earlier genome-wide analyses of minisatellites59, we did not find evidence that TR changes are mediated by unequal crossover between homologues during meiosis as none of our TR de novo SVs (n = 27) coincided with recombination breakpoints. Of particular interest in this regard is the discovery of 32 recurrently mutated TRs—loci rarely discovered out of the context of unstable disease alleles60. At five of these recurrent loci, we discovered multiple DNMs within a single generation (G3); these DNMs may be the outcome of germline mosaicism in a G2 parent or the activity of hypermutable TRs. Nearly all of these highly recurrent de novo events produced TR alleles that are significantly longer than the average short-read length and were detectable only using LRS. This includes changes in the length of around 7% of human centromeres in which insertions and deletions all occur as multiples of the predominant HOR unit56. The rate of de novo SVs increased from previous estimates of 0.2–0.3 per generation15,61 to 3–4 de novo SVs per generation reported in this study.

There are several limitations to this study. First, homopolymers still remain challenging even with the use of Element data as longer alleles and motifs embedded in larger repeats are still not reliably assayed with short reads. Second, we were unable to characterize DNMs in the acrocentric regions due to the repetitive nature of the regions and rampant ectopic recombination4. Third, we limited DNM discovery to the first three generations of only one multigenerational family and used G4 for validation purposes of transmitted variants. We acknowledge that familial variation depends on the genetic background14,36,62 and, therefore, many more families will be required to establish a reliable estimate of the mutation rate, especially for complex regions of the genome. In that regard, it is perhaps noteworthy that efforts are underway to characterize additional pedigrees. Notwithstanding, this study highlights that a single sequencing technology and a single human genome reference are insufficient to comprehensively estimate mutation rates. Multigenerational resources such as these will further refine DNM estimates and serve as another useful benchmark63 for new algorithms and new sequencing technologies.

Informed consent was obtained from the CEPH/Utah individuals, and the University of Utah Institutional Review Board approved the study (University of Utah IRB reference IRB_00065564). This includes informed consent for publication of research data for 23 family members; the remaining 5 provided informed consent for biobanking with controlled access (Data availability).

Cell lines for 14 members of the CEPH 1463 family (G1-GM12889, G1-GM12890, G1-GM12891, G1-GM12892, G2-GM12877, G2-GM12878, G3-GM12879, G3-GM12881, G3-GM12882, G3-GM12883, G3-GM12884, G3-GM12885, G3-GM12886 and G3-GM12887) were obtained from Coriell Institute for Medical Research (CEPH collection). Cell lines for G3 spouses and G4 family members (n = 13) were generated in-house as EBV transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines and include: G3-200080-spouse, G4-200081, G4-200082, G4-200084, G4-200085, G4-200086, G4-200087, G3-200100-spouse, G4-200101, G4-200102, G4-200103, G4-200104 and G4-200106.

All cell lines were authenticated by WGS of the DNA and subsequent variant calling to match the expected sex of the individual and sequencing results from blood-derived DNA from the same individual. Furthermore, we explored whether the obtained sequencing data match the expected inheritance patterns of parents and offspring. To our knowledge, none of the cell lines mentioned above were tested for mycoplasma contamination.

Family members from G2 and G3 were re-engaged for the purpose of updating informed consent and health history, and for enrolling their children (G4) and the marry-in parent (G3). Archived DNA from G2 and G3 was extracted from whole blood. Newly enrolled family members underwent informed consent, and blood was obtained for DNA and cell lines. DNA was extracted from whole blood using the Flexigene system (Qiagen 51206). All samples are broadly consented for scientific purposes, which makes this dataset ideal for future tool development and benchmarking studies.

Sequencing data from orthogonal short- and long-read platforms were generated as follows:

Illumina WGS data for G1–G3 were generated as previously described14. Illumina WGS data for G4 and marry-in spouses for G3 were generated by the Northwest Genomics Center using the PCR-free TruSeq library prep kit and sequenced to approximately 30× on the NovaSeq 6000 with paired-end 150 bp reads.

PacBio HiFi data were generated according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In brief, DNA was extracted from blood samples as described or cultured lymphoblasts using the Monarch HMW DNA Extraction Kit for Cells & Blood (New England Biolabs, T3050L). At all steps, quantification was performed with Qubit dsDNA HS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Q32854) measured on DS-11 FX (Denovix) and the size distribution checked using FEMTO Pulse (Agilent, M5330AA and FP-1002-0275.) HMW DNA was sheared with the Megaruptor 3 (Diagenode, B06010003 & E07010003) system using the settings 28/30, 28/31 or 27/29 based on the initial quality check to target a peak size of ~22 kb. After shearing, the DNA was used to generate PacBio HiFi libraries using the SMRTbell prep kit 3.0 (PacBio, 102-182-700). Size selection was performed either with diluted AMPure PB beads according to the protocol, or with Pippin HT using a high-pass cut-off between 10–17 kb based on shear size (Sage Science, HTP0001 and HPE7510). Libraries were sequenced either on the Sequel II platform on SMRT Cells 8M (PacBio, 101-389-001) using Sequel II sequencing chemistry 3.2 (PacBio,102-333-300) with 2 h pre-extension and 30 h movies on SMRT Link v.11.0 or 11.1, or on the Revio platform on Revio SMRT Cells (PacBio, 102-202-200) and Revio polymerase kit v1 (PacBio, 102-817-600) with 2 h pre-extension and 24 h movies on SMRT Link v.12.0.

To generate UL sequencing reads >100 kb, we used ONT sequencing. Ultra-high molecular mass gDNA was extracted from the lymphoblastoid cell lines according to a previously published protocol64. In brief, 3–5 × 107 cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.1 M EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and 20 mg ml−1 RNase A for 1 h at 37 °C. Then, 200 μg ml−1 proteinase K was added, and the solution was incubated at 50 °C for 2 h. DNA was purified through two rounds of 25:24:1 phenol–chloroform–isoamyl alcohol extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. Precipitated DNA was solubilized in 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) containing 0.02% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 2 days.

Libraries were constructed using the Ultra-Long DNA Sequencing Kit (ONT, SQK-ULK001) with modifications to the manufacturer's protocol: ~40 μg of DNA was mixed with FRA enzyme and FDB buffer as described in the protocol and incubated for 5 min at room temperature, followed by heat inactivation for 5 min at 75 °C. RAP enzyme was mixed with the DNA solution and incubated at room temperature for 1 h before the clean-up step. Clean-up was performed using the Nanobind UL Library Prep Kit (Circulomics, NB-900-601-01) and eluted in 450 μl EB. Then, 75 μl of library was loaded onto a primed FLO-PRO002 R9.4.1 flow cell for sequencing on the PromethION (using MinKNOW software v.21.02.17–23.04.5), with two nuclease washes and reloads after 24 and 48 h of sequencing. All G1–G3 ONT base calling was done with Guppy (v.6.3.7).

Element WGS data were generated according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In brief, DNA was extracted from whole blood as described above. PCR-free libraries were prepared using mechanical shearing, yielding ~350 bp fragments, and the Element Elevate library preparation kit (Element Biosciences, 830-00008). Linear libraries were quantified by quantitative PCR and sequenced on AVITI 2 × 150 bp flow cells (Element Biosciences, not yet commercially available). Bases2Fastq Software (Element Biosciences) was used to generate demultiplexed FASTQ files.

Single-cell Strand-seq libraries were prepared using a streamlined version of the established OP-Strand-seq protocol65 with the following modifications. In brief, EBV cells from G1–3 were cultured for 24 h in the presence of BrdU and nuclei with BrdU in the G1 phase of the cell cycle were sorted using fluorescence-activated cell sorting as described previously65. Next, single nuclei were dispensed into individual wells of an open 72 × 72 well nanowell array and treated with heat-labile protease, followed by digestion of DNA with the restriction enzymes AluI and HpyCH4V (NEB) instead of micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Next, fragments were A-tailed, ligated to forked adapters, UV-treated and PCR-amplified with index primers. The use of restriction enzymes results in short, reproducible, blunt-ended DNA fragments (>90% smaller than 1 kb) that do not require end-repair before adapter ligation, in contrast to the ends of DNA generated by MNase. Omitting end-repair enzymes allows dispensing of index primers in advance of dispensing individual nuclei. The pre-spotted, dried primers survive and do not interfere with the library preparation steps before PCR amplification. Pre-spotting of index primers is more reliable than the transfer of index primers between arrays during library preparation as described previously65. Strand-seq libraries were pooled and cleaned with AMPure XP beads, and library fragments between 300 and 700 bp were gel purified before PE75 sequencing on either the NextSeq 550 or the AVITI (Element Biosciences) system. Supplementary Fig. 40 shows examples of Strand-seq libraries made with restriction enzymes.

The demultiplexed FASTQ files were aligned to both GRCh38 and T2T-CHM13 reference assemblies (Supplementary Table 14) using BWA66 (v.0.7.17-r1188) for standard library selection. Aligned reads were sorted by genomic position using SAMtools67 (v.1.10) and duplicate reads were marked using sambamba68 (v.1.0). Libraries passing quality filters were pre-selected using ASHLEYS69 (v.0.2.0). We also evaluated such selected Strand-seq libraries manually and further excluded libraries with an uneven coverage, or an excess of ‘background reads' (reads mapped in opposing orientation for chromosomes expected to inherit only Crick or Watson strands) as previously described70. This is done to ensure accurate inversion detection and phasing.

Polymorphic inversions for G1–G3 were detected by mapping Strand-seq read orientation with respect to the reference genome as previously described71,72. For each sample, we selected 60+ Strand-seq libraries (range, 62–90) with a median of around 274,000 reads with mapping quality ≥10 per library, translating to about 0.67% genome (T2T-CHM13) being covered per library (Supplementary Fig. 41). Then we ran breakpointR73 (v.1.15.1) across selected Strand-seq libraries to detect points of strand-state changes73. We used these results to generate sample-specific composite files using breakpointR function ‘synchronizeReadDir' as described previously71. Again, we ran breakpointR on such composite files to detect regions where Strand-seq reads map in reverse orientation and are indicative of an inversion. Lastly, we manually evaluated each reported inverted region by inspection of Strand-seq read mapping in UCSC Genome Browser74 and removed any low-confidence calls. We phased all inversions using Strand-seq data as well and then synchronized the phase with phased genome assemblies based on haplotype concordance. Lastly, we evaluated the Mendelian concordance of detected and fully phased inversions. We mark sites where at least half of the G3 samples were fully phased by Strand-seq and concordant with possible inherited G2 parental alleles as being Mendelian concordant (Supplementary Table 7).

Phased genome assemblies were generated using two different algorithms, namely Verkko (v.1.3.1 and v.1.4.1)16 and hifiasm (UL) with ONT support (v.0.19.5)17. Owing to active development of the Verkko and hifiasm algorithms, assemblies were generated with two different versions. Phased assemblies for G2–G3 were generated using a combination of HiFi and ONT reads using parental Illumina k-mers for phasing. To generate phased genome assemblies of G1, we still used a combination of HiFi and ONT reads with the Verkko pipeline and used Strand-seq to phase assembly graphs75. Lastly, G4 samples were assembled using HiFi reads only with hifiasm (v.0.19.5).

Note that trio-based phasing with Verkko assigns maternal to haplotype 1 and paternal to haplotype 2. By contrast, for hifiasm assemblies, we report switched haplotype labelling such that haplotype 1 is paternal and haplotype 2 is maternal to match HPRC standard for hifiasm assemblies.

To evaluate the base pair and structural accuracy of each phased assembly, we used a multitude of assembly evaluation tools as well as orthogonal datasets such as PacBio HiFi, ONT, Strand-seq, Illumina and Element data. Known assembly issues are listed in Supplementary Table 4. We note that we fixed four haplotype switch errors in our assembly-based variant callsets to avoid biases in subsequent analysis. The assembly-quality terminology used in this Article is described in Supplementary Note 8.

We used Strand-seq data to evaluate directional and structural accuracy of each phased assembly. First, we aligned selected Strand-seq libraries for each sample to the phased de novo assembly using BWA66 (v.0.7.17-r1188). We next ran breakpointR73 (v.1.15.1) using aligned BAM files as the input. We then created directional composite files using the breakpointR function createCompositeFiles followed by running breakpointR on such composite files using the runBreakpointR function. This provided us, for any given sample, with regions where strand-state changes across all single-cell Strand-seq libraries. Many such regions point to real heterozygous inversions. However, regions where Strand-seq reads mapped in opposite orientation with respect to surrounding regions are probably caused by misorientation. Moreover, positions where the strand state of Strand-seq reads changes repeatedly in multiple libraries might be a sign of an assembly misjoin and such regions were investigated more closely to rule out any such large structural assembly inconsistencies.

To evaluate de novo assembly accuracy, we aligned sample-specific PacBio HiFi reads to their corresponding phased genome assemblies using Winnowmap76 (v.2.03) with the following parameters:


-I 10G -Y -ax map-pb --MD --cs -L --eqx


Flagger9 was used to detect misassemblies using HiFi read alignments to the assemblies and the assemblies aligned to the reference genome. Regions were flagged on the basis of read alignment divergence and specific reference-biased regions. A reference-specific BED file (chm13v2.0.sd.bed) was used, setting a maximum read divergence of 2% and specifying reference-biased blocks. These flagged regions were analysed to identify collapses, false duplications, erroneous regions and correctly assembled haploid blocks with the expected read coverage.

We used Flagger v.0.3.3 (https://github.com/mobinasri/flagger) to run the flagger_end_to_end WDL.

Required inputs include following:

Read-to-contig alignments—Winnowmap alignments of all HiFi reads to the assembly (hap1, hap2 and unassigned.fasta)

A combined assembly fasta file with hap1, hap2 and unassigned contigs

BAM alignments of assembly to the CHM13v2.0 reference

hap1, hap2 and unassigned fasta files of the assembly were aligned to CHM13v2.0 using a pipeline available at GitHub (https://github.com/mrvollger/asm-to-reference-alignment).

NucFreq77 (v.0.1) was used to calculate nucleotide frequencies for HiFi reads aligned using Winnowmap76 (v.2.03). This was used to identify regions of collapses, where the second-highest nucleotide count exceeded 5; and misassembly, where all nucleotide counts were zero.

The NucFreq analysis pipeline is available at GitHub (https://github.com/mrvollger/NucFreq).

To evaluate the accuracy of the genome assembly, we used a pipeline that uses Meryl78 (v.1.0) to count the k-mers of length 21 from Illumina reads using the following command:

meryl k=21 count {input.fastq} output {output.meryl}

We then used Merqury78 (v.1.1), which compares the k-mers from the sequencing reads against those in the assembled genome and flags discrepancies where k-mers are uniquely found only in the assembly. These unique k-mers indicate potential base-pair errors. Merqury then calculates the quality value based on the k-mer survival rate, estimated from Meryl's k-mer counts, providing a quantitative measure to assess the completeness and correctness of the genome assembly.

To evaluate the completeness of single-copy genes in our assemblies, we used compleasm79 (v.0.2.4). Further details are available at GitHub (https://github.com/huangnengCSU/compleasm).

We ran compleasm with the following parameters:


compleasm.py run -a {assembly.fasta} -o results/{sample.id} -t {threads} -l {params.lineage} -m {params.mode} -L {params.mb_downloads}



-l primates
-m busco
-L {params.mb_downloads}


and downloaded using: compleasm_kit/compleasm.py download primates.

All de novo assemblies were aligned to both GRCh38 as well as to the complete version of the human reference genome T2T-CHM13 (v2) using minimap2 (ref. 80) (v.2.24) with the following command:


minimap2 -K 8G -t {threads} -ax asm20 \


--secondary=no --eqx -s 25000 \


{input.ref} {input.query} \
| samtools view -F 4 -b - > {output.bam}


A complete pipeline for this reference alignment is available at GitHub: (https://github.com/mrvollger/asm-to-reference-alignment).

We also generated a trimmed version of these alignments using the rustybam (v.0.1.33) (https://github.com/mrvollger/rustybam) function trim-paf to trim redundant alignments that mostly appear at highly identical SDs. With this, we aim to reduce the effect of multiple alignments of a single contig over these duplicated regions.

For this analysis, we use assembly to reference alignments (see the ‘Assembly to reference alignment' section), reported as PAF files. We used trimmed PAF files reported by the rustybam trim-paf function. Stable diploid regions were defined as regions where phased genome assemblies report exactly one contig alignment for haplotype 1 as well as haplotype 2 and are assigned as ‘2n' regions. Any region with two or more alignments per haplotype is assigned as ‘multi' alignment. Lastly, regions with only single-contig alignment in a single haplotype are assigned as ‘1n' regions. These reports were generated using the ‘getPloidy' R function (Code availability).

We constructed a high-resolution recombination map of G2 and G3 individuals using three orthogonal approaches that differ either on the basis of the underlying sequencing technology or on the detection algorithm applied to the data. The first approach is based on chromosome-length haplotypes extracted from Strand-seq data using R package StrandPhaseR81 (v.0.99). The second approach uses inheritance vectors derived from Mendelian consistency of small variants across the family pedigree13. Our final approach uses trio-based phased genome assemblies followed by small variant calling using PAV and Dipcall to more precisely define the meiotic breakpoints.

By contrast, a recombination map of G4 individuals was constructed using a combination of Strand-seq data for G3 spouses and an assembly-based variant callset (Dipcall) of G4 samples. Owing to the use of a low-variant density of Strand-seq-based haplotypes of G4 spouses, reported recombination breakpoints are of lower resolution in comparison to G2 and G3 samples (Supplementary Table 8).

To map meiotic recombination breakpoints using circular binary segmentation, we used two different datasets. The first dataset represents phased small variants (SNVs and indels) as reported by Strand-seq-based (SSQ) phasing22,81. The other is based on small variants reported in trio-based phased assemblies either by PAV8 (v.2.3.4) or Dipcall82 (v.0.3). With this approach, we set to detect recombination breakpoints as positions where a child's haplotype switches from matching H1 to H2 of a given parent or vice versa. To detect these positions, we first established which homologue in a child was inherited from either parent by calculating the level of agreement between child's alleles and homozygous variants in each parent. Next, we compared each child's homologue to both homologues of the corresponding parent and encoded them as 0 or 1 if they match H1 or H2, respectively. We applied a circular binary segmentation algorithm on such binary vectors by using the R function fastseg implemented in the R package fastseg83 (v.1.46.0) with the following parameters: fastseg (binary.vector, minSeg={}, segMedianT=c (0.8, 0.2)). In the case of sparse Strand-seq haplotypes, we set the fastseg parameter minSeg to 20 and, in the case of dense assembly-based haplotypes, we used a larger window of 400 and 500 for Dipcall- and PAV-based variant calls to achieve comparable sensitivity in detecting recombination breakpoints. The regions with a segmentation mean of ≤0.25 are then marked as H1 while regions with a segmentation mean of ≥0.75 are assigned as H2. Regions with a segmentation mean in between these values were deemed to be ambiguous and were excluded. Moreover, we filtered out regions shorter than 500 kb and merged consecutive regions assigned the same haplotype (Code availability).

DeepVariant calls (see the ‘Read-based variant calling' section) from HiFi sequencing data from G1, G2 and G3 pedigree members allow us to identify the haplotype of origin for heterozygous loci in G3 and infer the occurrence of a recombination along the chromosome when the haplotype of origin changes between loci. An initial outline of the inheritance vectors was identified by first applying a depth filter to remove variants outside the expected coverage distribution per sample; inheritance was then sketched out using a custom script, requiring a minimum of 10 SNVs supporting a particular haplotype, and manually refined to remove biologically unlikely haplotype blocks, or add additional haplotype blocks, where support existed, and refine haplotype coordinates. Missing recombinations were identified from the occurrence of blocks of pedigree-violating variants, matching the location of assembly-based recombination calls. We developed a hidden Markov model framework to identify the most probable sequence of inheritance vectors from SNV sites using the Viterbi algorithm. For details including the transition/emission probabilities see ref. 18 and the associated GitHub repository (https://github.com/Platinum-Pedigree-Consortium/Platinum-Pedigree-Inheritance).

The transition matrix defines the probability of a given inheritance state transition (recombination). The emission matrix defines the probability that a variant call at a particular locus accurately describes the inheritance state. The values contained within transition and emission matrices were refined to recapitulate the previously identified inheritance vectors, while correctly identifying missing vectors. The Viterbi algorithm identified 539 recombinations, a maternal recombination rate of 1.29 cM per Mb, and a paternal recombination rate of 0.99 cM per Mb. Maternal bias was observed in the pedigree, with 57% of recombinations identified in G3 of maternal origin.

Meiotic recombination breakpoints reported by different orthogonal technologies and algorithms (see the sections ‘Detection of meiotic recombination breakpoints using circular binary segmentation' and ‘Detection of meiotic recombination breakpoints using inheritance vectors') were merged separately for G2 and G3 samples. We started with the G3 recombination map where we used an inheritance-based map as a reference and then looked for support of each reference breakpoint in recombination maps reported based on PAV, Dipcall and Strand-seq (SSQ) phased variants. A recombination breakpoint was supported if for a given sample and homologue an orthogonal technology reported a breakpoint no further than 1 Mb from the reference breakpoint. Any recombination breakpoint that is further apart is reported as unique. We repeated this for the G2 recombination map as well. However, in the case of the G2 recombination map, we used a PAV-based map as a reference. This is because inheritance-based approaches need three generations to map recombination breakpoints in G3. We also report a column called ‘best.range', which is the narrowest breakpoint across all orthogonal recombination maps that directly overlaps with a given reference breakpoint. Lastly, we report a ‘min.range' column that represents for any given breakpoint a range with the highest coverage across all orthogonal datasets. Merged recombination breakpoints are reported in Supplementary Table 8.

We tested enrichment of all (n = 1,503) recombination breakpoints detected in G2–G4 with respect to T2T-CHM13 if they cluster towards the ends of the chromosomes depending on parental homologue origin. For this, we counted the number of recombination breakpoints in the last 5% of each chromosome end specifically for maternal and paternal breakpoints. We then shuffle detected recombination breakpoints along each chromosome 1,000 times and redo the counts. For the permutation analysis, we used the R package regioneR84 (v.1.32.0) and its function permTest with the following parameters:


permTest(
A=breakpoints, B=chrEnds.regions,
randomize.function=circularRandomizeRegions,
evaluate.function=numOverlaps,
genome=genome, ntimes=1000,
allow.overlaps=FALSE, per.chromosome=TRUE,
mask=region.mask, count.once=FALSE)


Up to this point, all meiotic recombination breakpoints were called using variation detected with respect to a single linear reference (GRCh38 or T2T-CHM13). To alleviate any possible biases introduced by comparison to a single reference genome, we set out to refine detected recombination breakpoints for each inherited homologue (in child) directly in comparison to parental haplotypes from whom the homologue was inherited from. We start with a set of merged T2T-CHM13 reference breakpoints for G3 only by selecting the ‘best.range' column (Supplementary Table 8). Then, for each breakpoint, we set a ‘lookup' region to 750 kb on each side from the breakpoint boundaries and used the SVbyEye85 (v.0.99.0) function subsetPafAlignments to subset PAF alignments of a phased assembly to the reference (T2T-CHM13) to a given region. We next extract the FASTA sequence for a given region from the phased assembly. We did this separately for inherited child homologues (recombined) and the corresponding parental haplotypes that belong to a parent from whom the child homologue was inherited from.

Next, we created a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) for three sequences (child-inherited homologue, parental homologue 1 and parental homologue 2) using the R package DECIPHER86 (v.2.28.0; with the function AlignSeqs). Fasta sequences of which the size differ by more than 100 kb or their nucleotide frequencies differ by more than 10,000 bases are skipped due to increased computational time needed to align such different sequences optimally using DECIPHER. After MSA construction, we selected positions with at least one mismatch and also removed sites where both parental haplotypes carry the same allele. A recombination breakpoint is a region where the inherited child homologue is partly matching alleles coming from parental homologues 1 and 2. We therefore skipped analysis of MSAs in which a child's alleles are more than 99% identical to a single parental homologue. If this filter is passed, we use the custom R function getAlleleChangepoints (Code availability) to detect changepoints where the child's inherited haplotype switches from matching alleles coming from parental haplotype 1 to alleles coming from parental haplotype 2. Such MSA-specific changepoints are then reported as a new range where a recombination breakpoint probably occurred. Lastly, we attempt to report reference coordinates of such MSA-specific breakpoints by extracting 1 kb long k-mers from the breakpoint boundaries and matching such k-mers against reference sequence (per chromosome) using R package Biostrings (v.2.70.2) with its function ‘matchPattern' and allowing for up to 10 mismatches. A list of refined recombination breakpoints is reported in Supplementary Table 8.

We set out to detect smaller localized changes in parental allele inheritance using a previously defined recombination map of this family. We did this analysis for all G3 samples (n = 8) in comparison to G2 parents. For this, we iterated over each child's homologue (in each sample) and compared it to both parental homologues from which the child's homologue was inherited from. We did this by comparing SNV and indel calls obtained from phased genome assemblies between the child and corresponding parent. To consider only reliable variants, we retained only those supported by at least two read-based callers (either DeepVariant-HiFi, Clair3-ONT or dragen-Illumina callset). We further retained only variable sites that are heterozygous in the parent and were also called in the child. After such strict variant filtering, we slide by two consecutive child's variants at a time and compare them to both haplotype 1 and haplotype 2 of the respective parent of origin. For this similarity calculation, we use the custom R function getHaplotypeSimilarity (Code Availability). Then, for each haplotype segment, defined by recombination breakpoints, we report regions where at least two consecutive variants match the opposing parental haplotype in contrast to the expected parental homologue defined by recombination map. We further merge consecutive regions that are ≤5 kb apart. For the list of putative gene conversion events, we retained only regions that have not been reported as problematic by Flagger. We also removed regions that are ≤100 kb from previously defined recombination events and events that overlap centromeric satellite regions and highly identical SDs (≥99% identical). Lastly, we evaluated the list of putative allelic gene conversion events by visual inspection of phased HiFi reads.

PacBio HiFi data were processed with the human-WGS-WDL available at GitHub (https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/HiFi-human-WGS-WDL/releases/tag/v1.0.3). The pipeline aligns, phases and calls small variants (using DeepVariant87 v.1.6.0) and SVs (using PBSV v.2.9.0; https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbsv). We used the aligned haplotype-tagged HiFi BAMs for all downstream PacBio analysis.

Clair3 (ref. 88) (v.1.0.7) variant calls were made based on the alignments with default models for PacBio HiFi and ONT (ont_guppy5) data, respectively, with phasing and gVCF generation enabled. Variant calling was conducted on each chromosome individually and concatenated into one VCF. gVCFs were then fed into GLNexus89 with a custom configuration file.

ONT reads for Clair3 calling were aligned with minimap2 (v.2.21) with the following parameters: -L --MD --secondary=no --eqx -x map-ont.

We used a previously established framework to define ground truth genetic variation13. Our analysis, in contrast to trio-based filtering, uses all four alleles to detect genotyping errors, whereas, in a trio, only two alleles are transmitted and observed. By testing the genotype patterns in the third generation against the phased haplotypes of the first generation (A,B,C,D), we can test for the correct transmission of alleles from the second to third generations. We establish a map of the haplotypes across the third generation (inheritance vector) from which we can adjudicate variant calls against. To test for pedigree consistency, we implemented code that uses the inheritance vector as the expected haplotypes and test the possible genotype configurations within the query VCF file. Using the haplotype structure, we phase the pedigree consistent variants. These functions are implemented as a single binary tool that requires the inheritance vectors and a standard formatted VCF file, for example:


concordance -i ceph.grch38.hifi.g3.csv –father NA12877 –mother NA12878 –vcf input.vcf –prefix pedigree_filtered > info.stdout


The pedigree filtering and additional steps to build a small variant truth set are available at GitHub (https://github.com/Platinum-Pedigree-Consortium/Platinum-Pedigree-Inheritance).

Following the parameters outlined previously10, we called variants in HiFi data aligned to T2T-CHM13 using GATK HaplotypeCaller90 (v.4.3.0.0) and DeepVariant87 (v.1.4.0) and naively identified variants unique to each G2 and G3 sample. We separated out SNV and indel calls and applied basic quality filters, such as removing clusters of three or more SNVs in a 1 kb window. We combined this set of variant calls generated by a secondary calling method (https://github.com/Platinum-Pedigree-Consortium/Platinum-Pedigree-Inheritance/blob/main/analyses/Denovo.md) and subjected all calls to the following validation process.

We validated both SNVs and indels by examining them in HiFi, ONT and Illumina read data, excluding reads that failed to reach the mapping quality (59 for long reads, 0 for short reads) thresholds. Reads with high base quality (>20) and low base quality (<20) at the variant site were counted separately. We retained variants that were present in at least two types of sequencing data for the child, and absent from high-base-quality parental reads. For SNV calls, we next examined HiFi data for every sample in the pedigree. We determined an SNV was truly de novo if it was absent from every family member that was not a direct descendant of the de novo sample. Finally, we examined the allele balance of every variant, determined which variants were in TRs and re-evaluated parental read data across all sequencing platforms, removing variants with noisy sequencing data or more than two low-quality parental reads supporting the alternative allele (Supplementary Note 9).

To determine the parent of origin for the de novo SNVs, we re-examined the long reads containing the de novo allele. First, we used our initial GATK variant calls to identify informative sites in an 80 kb window around the DNM, selecting any single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) where one allele could be uniquely assigned to one parent (for example, a site that is homozygous reference in a father and heterozygous in a mother). For every DNM, we evaluated every ONT and HiFi read that aligned to the site of the de novo allele and assigned it to either a paternal or maternal haplotype (if informative SNPs were available) by calculating an inheritance score as outlined previously10. DNMs that were exclusively assigned to maternal or paternal haplotypes were successfully phased, whereas DNMs on conflicting haplotypes were excluded from our final callset. Unphased variants were determined to be postzygotic in origin (n = 7) if their allele balance was not significantly different across platforms (by a χ2 test) and if their combined allele balance was significantly different from 0.5.

Once we assigned every read to a parental haplotype, we counted the number of maternal and paternal reads that had either the reference or alternative allele. We determined that a DNM was germline in origin if it was present on every read from a given parent's haplotype. Conversely, if a DNM was present on only a fraction of reads from a parental haplotype, we determined that it was postzygotic in origin.

To identify DNMs on the X chromosome, we applied the same strategy as autosomal variants, with one exception: we used only variant calls generated by GATK. For male individuals, we reran GATK in haploid mode, such that it would only identify one genotype on the X chromosome.

To identify DNMs on the Y chromosome, we aligned male HiFi, ONT and Illumina data to the G1-NA12889 chromosome Y assembly and then called variants using GATK in haploid mode on the aligned HiFi data. We directly compared each male to his father, selecting variants unique to the son. We validated SNVs and indels by examining the father's HiFi, ONT and Illumina data and excluded any variants that were present in the parental reads, applying the same logic that we used for autosomal variants.

To determine where we were able to identify de novo variation in the genome, we assessed HiFi data for every trio. We first used GATK HaplotypeCaller90 (v.4.3.0.0) with the option ‘ERC BP_RESOLUTION' to generate a genotype call at every site in the genome. Only sites where both parents were genotyped as homozygous reference (0/0) were considered callable, as sites with a parental alternative allele were excluded from our de novo discovery pipeline. We then examined the HiFi reads from a sample and its parents, restricting to only primary alignments with mapping quality of at least 59. For children, we only considered HiFi reads derived from blood, but we considered blood and cell line data for parents. We counted the number of reads with a minimum base quality score of 20 at every site in the genome and then combined this information with our variant calls. A site was deemed to be callable if both parents and the child each had at least one high-quality read with a high-quality base call. We observed an average of 2.67 Gb of accessible sequence across the autosomes (out of 2.90 Gb total, s.d. = 24.9 Mb). For female children, callable X chromosome was determined in the same way, whereas, for the male children, we only considered the mother's HiFi data when examining the X chromosome and the father's HiFi data when examining the Y chromosome. Moreover, male sex chromosomes were not restricted to sites where both parents were genotyped as reference—each parent was allowed to carry an alternative allele.

We calculated the germline autosomal mutation rate for every sample by dividing the number of germline autosomal DNMs by twice the number of base pairs we determined to be callable. For PZMs, we used the same denominator. In female individuals, the amount of callable sex chromosomes was defined as twice the number of callable bases on the X chromosome, and in males it was defined as the sum of the callable bases on the X and Y chromosomes. For each feature-specific mutation rate (such as SDs), we intersected both a sample's de novo SNVs and the sample's callable regions with coordinates of the relevant feature. We then calculated the mutation rate by dividing the number of SNVs in the region by the amount of callable genomic sequence where alignments could be reliably made.

Given the challenges associated with assaying mutations in STRs (1–6 bp motifs) and VNTRs (≥7 bp motifs), we applied a targeted HiFi genotyping strategy coupled with validation by transmission and orthogonal sequencing.

The command trf-mod -s 20 -l 160 {reference.fasta} was used, resulting in a minimum reference locus size of 10 bp and motif sizes of 1 to 2,000 bp (https://github.com/lh3/TRF-mod)91. Loci within 50 bp were merged, and then any loci >10,000 bp were discarded. The remaining loci were annotated with tr-solve (https://github.com/trgt-paper/tr-solve) to resolve locus structure in compound loci. Only TRs annotated on Chromosomes 1–22, X and Y were considered (Data availability).

TRGT32 is a software tool for genotyping TR alleles using PacBio HiFi sequencing reads (https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/trgt). Provided with aligned HiFi sequencing reads (in BAM format) and a file that enumerates the genomic locations and motif structures of a collection of TR loci, TRGT will return a VCF file with inferred genotypes at each TR locus. In this analysis, we ran TRGT (v.0.7.0-493ef25) on each member of the CEPH 1463 pedigree using the TR catalogue defined above. TRGT was run using the default parameters:


trgt --threads 32 --genome {in_reference} --repeats {in_bed} --reads {in_bam} --output-prefix {out_prefix} --karyotype {karyotype}`
bcftools sort -m 3072M -Ob -o {out_prefix}.sorted.vcf.gz {out_prefix}.vcf.gz
bcftools index --threads 4 {out_prefix}.sorted.vcf.gz
samtools sort -@ 8 -o {out_prefix}.spanning.sorted.bam {out_prefix}.spanning.bam
samtools index -@ 8 {out_prefix}.spanning.sorted.bam


To determine the concordant inheritance of TRs, we calculated the possible Manhattan distances derived from all possible combinations of a proband's allele length (AL) from TRGT with both the maternal and paternal AL values. We considered a locus to be concordant if the minimum Manhattan distance from all computed distances was found to be 0, suggesting that a combination of the proband's AL values matched the parental AL values perfectly. By contrast, if the minimum Manhattan distance was greater than 0, suggesting that all combinations of the proband's AL values exhibited some deviation from the parental AL values, we regarded the locus as discordant and recorded it as a potential Mendelian inheritance error. For each TR locus, we calculated the number of concordant trios, the number of MIE trios and the number of trios that had missing values and could not be fully genotyped. Loci with any missing genotypes were excluded when calculating the percent concordance; however, individual complete trios were considered for de novo variant calling below.

We focused de novo TR calling on G3 for several reasons. First, their G2 parents (NA12877 and NA12878) were sequenced to 99 and 109 HiFi sequencing depths, resulting in a far lower chance of parental allelic dropout than samples with more modest sequencing depths. Second, G1 DNA was derived from cell lines, increasing the risk of artefacts when calling DNMs in G2. And finally, DNMs in the two individuals in G3 with sequenced children in our study can be further assessed by transmission.

We used TRGT-denovo33 (v.0.1.3), a companion tool to TRGT, to enable in-depth analysis of TR DNMs in family trios using HiFi sequencing data (https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/trgt-denovo). TRGT-denovo uses consensus allele sequences and genotyping data generated by TRGT and also incorporates additional evidence from spanning HiFi reads used to predict these allele sequences. In brief, TRGT-denovo extracts and partitions spanning reads from each family member (mother, father and child) to their most likely alleles. Parental spanning reads are realigned to each of the two consensus allele sequences in the child, and alignment scores (which summarize the difference between a parental read and a consensus allele sequence) are computed for each read. At every TR locus, each of the two child alleles is independently considered as a putative de novo candidate. For each child allele, TRGT-denovo reports the presence or absence of evidence for a de novo event, which includes the following: denovo_coverage (the number of reads supporting a unique AL in the child that is absent from the parent's reads); overlap_coverage (the number of reads in the parents supporting an AL that is highly similar to the putative de novo allele); and magnitude of the putative de novo event (expressed as the absolute mean difference of the read alignment scores with de novo coverage relative to the closest parental allele).

We measured the sizes of de novo TR alleles with respect to the parental TR allele that most likely experienced a contraction or expansion event. If TRGT-denovo reported a de novo expansion or contraction at a particular locus, we did the following to calculate the size of the event.

Given the ALs reported by TRGT for each member of the trio, we computed the difference in size (which we call a ‘diff') between the de novo TR allele in the child and all four TR alleles in the child's parents. For example, if TRGT reported ALs of 100,100 in the father, 50,150 in the mother, and 200,100 in the child, and the allele of length 200 was reported to be de novo in the child, the diffs would be 100,100 in the father and 150,50 in the mother. If we were able to phase the de novo TR allele to a parent of origin, we simply identify the minimum diff among that parent's ALs and treat it as the likely expansion/contraction size. Otherwise, we assume that the smallest diff across all parental ALs represents the likely de novo size.

We applied a series of filters to the candidate TR DNMs (identified by TRGT-denovo) to remove likely false positives. For each de novo allele observed in a child, we required the following (Supplementary Notes 9 and 10):

HiFi sequencing depth in the child, mother, and father ≥10 reads.

The candidate de novo AL in the child must be unique: as in ref. 37, we removed candidate de novo TR alleles if (1) the child's de novo AL matched one of the father's ALs and the child's non-de novo AL matched one of the mother's ALs or (2) the child's de novo AL matched one of the mother's ALs and the child's non-de novo AL matched one of the father's ALs.

The candidate de novo allele must represent an expansion or contraction with respect to the parental allele.

At least two HiFi reads supporting the candidate de novo allele (denovo_coverage ≥ 2) in the child, and at least 20% of total reads supporting the candidate de novo allele (child_ratio ≥ 0.2).

Fewer than 5% of parental reads likely supporting the candidate de novo AL in the child.

To calculate TR DNM rates in a given individual, we first calculated the total number of TR loci (among the ~7.8 million loci genotyped using TRGT) that were covered by at least 10 HiFi sequencing reads in each member of the focal individual's trio (that is, the focal individual and both of their parents). We then divided the total count of de novo TR alleles by the total number of callable loci to obtain an overall DNM rate, expressed per locus per generation. Finally, we divided that rate by 2 to produce a mutation rate expressed per locus, per haplotype, per generation. As shown in Fig. 3a, we also estimated DNM rates as a function of the minimum motif size observed within a locus. For example, a locus with motif structure AT(n)AGA(n)T(n) would have a minimum motif size of 1. We counted the number of TR DNMs that occurred at loci with a minimum motif size of N and divided that count by the total number of TR loci with a minimum motif size of N that passed filtering thresholds. We then divided that rate by 2 to produce a mutation rate per locus, per haplotype, per generation. When calculating STR, VNTR and complex mutation rates, we defined STR loci as loci at which all constituent motifs were between 1 and 6 bp; we defined VNTR loci as loci at which all motifs were larger than 6 bp; and we defined complex loci as loci at which there were both STR (1–6 bp) and VNTR (≥7 bp) motifs. For example, both an A(n) locus and an AT(n)AGA(n)T(n) locus would be classified as STRs, as they both purely contain STR motifs.

Previous studies usually measured STR mutation rates at loci that are polymorphic within the cohort of interest. To generate mutation rate estimates that are more consistent with these previous studies, we also calculated the number of STR loci that were polymorphic within the CEPH 1463 pedigree. Loci were defined as polymorphic if at least two unique ALs were observed among the CEPH 1463 individuals at a given TR locus. We note that this definition of polymorphic STRs is sensitive to both the size of the cohort and the sequencing technology used to genotype STRs. As discussed in previous studies37, the number of polymorphic loci is proportional to the size of the cohort. Moreover, by defining loci as polymorphic if we observed more than one unique AL across the cohort, we may erroneously classify loci as polymorphic if HiFi sequencing reads exhibited a substantial amount of stutter at those loci, producing variable estimates of STR ALs across individuals. In total, 1,096,430 STRs were polymorphic within the cohort. To calculate mutation rates in each G3 individual, we applied the same coverage quality thresholds as described above.

The STRs genotyped by TRGT were phased using HiPhase92 (v.1.0.0-f1bc7a8). We followed HiPhase's guidelines for jointly phasing small variants, SVs and TRs by inputting the relevant VCF files from DeepVariant, PBSV and TRGT into HiPhase, resulting in three phased VCF files for each analysed sample. We also activated global realignment through the --global-realignment-cputime parameter to improve allele assignment accuracy. Note that HiPhase specifically excludes variants that fall entirely within genotyped STRs from the phasing process. This is motivated because STRs often encompass numerous smaller variants.

We used the phased genotypes inferred by HiPhase to determine the likely parent of origin for de novo TR expansions and contractions. For each phased de novo allele that we observed in a child, we examined all informative SNVs in that child's parents ±500 kb from the de novo allele. We defined informative sites using the following criteria: sites must be biallelic SNVs; total read depth in the mother, father and child must be at least 10 reads; Phred-scaled genotype quality in the mother, father and child must be at least 20; the child's genotype must be heterozygous; and the parents' genotypes must not be identical-by-state. Using the child's phased SNV VCF, we then determine whether the child's REF or ALT allele at the informative site was inherited from either the mother or father. For example, if the mother's genotype is 0/0, the father's genotype is 0/1 (note that the parental genotypes need not be phased), and the child's genotype is 1|0, we know that the child's first haplotype was inherited from the father and the second haplotype was inherited from the mother. We repeat this process for all informative sites within the ±500 kb interval. We then find the N informative sites that are (1) closest to the de novo TR allele (either upstream or downstream) while (2) supporting a consistent inheritance pattern in the child (that is, all support the same parent of origin for the child's two haplotypes) and (3) all reside within the same HiPhase phase block (defined using the PS tag in the HiPhase output VCF). Finally, we use the phased TR VCF produced by HiPhase to check whether the de novo allele was phased to either the first or second haplotype in the child. We then confirm that the de novo allele shares the same PS tag as the informative sites identified above and use the N informative sites to determine whether the haplotype to which the de novo allele was phased was probably inherited from either the mother or the father.

At each candidate de novo TR allele, we calculated concordance between the de novo ALs estimated by TRGT and the ALs supported by Element, ONT or HiFi reads. We restricted our concordance analyses to autosomal TR loci with a single expansion or contraction (that is, we did not analyse ‘complex' TR loci containing multiple unique expansions and/or contractions).

TRGT reports two AL estimates for every member of a trio at an autosomal TR locus, and TRGT-denovo assigns one of these two ALs to be the de novo AL in the child. At each TR locus, we calculated the difference between the length of the locus in the reference genome (in base pairs) and each of the two ALs in a given individual. We refer to the difference between the TRGT AL and the reference locus size as the relative AL. We then queried BAM files containing Element, Illumina, ONT or PacBio HiFi reads at each TR locus. Using the pysam library (https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam), we iterated over all reads that completely spanned the TR locus and had a mapping quality of 60. To estimate the AL of a TR expansion/contraction in a read with respect to the reference genome, we counted the number of nucleotides associated with every CIGAR operation that overlapped the TR locus. For example, an Element read might have the following CIGAR string: 100M2D10M6I32M. For each of the CIGAR operations that overlap the TR locus, we increment a counter by OP * BP, where OP equals 0 for ‘match' CIGAR operations, 1 for ‘insertion' operations, and -1 for ‘deletion' operations, and BP equals the number of base pairs associated with the given CIGAR operation. Thus, at each TR locus, we generated a distribution of net CIGAR operations in each member of the trio.

We used these net CIGAR operations to validate candidate de novo TR alleles in each child. For each de novo TR allele, we calculated the number of Element reads in the child that supported the de novo AL estimated by TRGT (allowing the Element reads to support the de novo AL ± 1 bp). We then calculated the number of Element reads in that child's parents supporting the de novo AL (also allowing for off-by-one errors). If at least one Element read supported the de novo TR AL in the child, and zero Element reads supported the de novo TR AL in both parents, we considered the de novo TR to be validated.

To assemble a confident list of candidate recurrent de novo TR alleles, we first assembled a list of TR loci where two or more CEPH 1463 individuals (in either G2, G3 or G4) harboured evidence for a de novo TR allele. For each candidate locus, we then required that all members of the CEPH 1463 pedigree were genotyped for a TR allele at the locus and had at least 10 aligned HiFi reads at the locus. These filters produced a list of 49 candidate loci where we observed evidence of either intragenerational or intergenerational recurrence. We visually inspected HiFi read evidence using the Integrated Genomics Viewer (IGV)93, as well as bespoke plots of HiFi CIGAR operations, at each locus to determine whether the candidate de novo TR alleles seemed plausible.

We attempted to obtain putative de novo SVs from three different sources. The first one is based on reporting de novo SVs from read-based callsets (PBSV (v.2.9.0), Sniffles94 (v.0.12.0), Sawfish95 (v.2.2)). The second reports putative de novo SVs from variants called in phased genome assemblies. The last used pangenome graphs constructed from phased genome assemblies to report de novo SVs.

SVPOP8 (v.3.4.0) (https://github.com/EichlerLab/svpop) was used to produce a merged PAV callset across all samples. It merges a single source (single SV caller) across multiple samples. The merge definition used was: nr::ro:szro:exact:match. The samples were provided in this order (G1–G2–G3): NA12889, NA12890, NA12891, NA12892, NA12877, NA12878, NA12879, NA12881, NA12882, NA12883, NA12884, NA12885, NA12886, NA12887.

For each sample in G3, we selected variants unique to that sample alone.

To compare variant calls against the previous generation, SVPOP was used again to do a PBSV/PAV intersection. This involved intersecting the PAV calls for G3 with the PBSV calls for G2, comparing each sample in G3 against each sample in G2.

The callable BED files from PAV, intersections with G2's PBSV calls, and the list of putative de novo calls went into our validation pipeline.

The pipeline (1) checks if the putative de novo variant was called by PBSV in either parent. (2) Checks if the putative de novo variant is seen in HiFi reads in either parent by running subseq (https://github.com/EichlerLab/subseq). (3) Checks if the variant was in a callable region in either parent. (4) Performs an MSA using DECIPHER of the two haplotypes of the sample, and both parents, in the location of the SV with 1,000 bp flank on either side.

Verkko assemblies were partitioned by chromosome by mapping them against the GRCh38, T2T-CHM13 and HG002 (v.1.0.1) human reference genomes using WFMASH (v.0.13.1-251f4e1) pangenome aligner. On each set of contigs, we applied PGGB (v0.6.0-87510bc) to build chromosome-level unbiased pangenome variation graphs96 with the following parameters: -s 20k -p 95 -k 47 -V chm13:100000, grch38:100000. We used the Variation graph toolkit97 (v.1.40.0) to call variants from the graphs with respect to both the T2T-CHM13 and GRCh38 reference genomes. Variants were then decomposed by applying VCFBUB (v.0.1.0-26a1f0c) to retain those found in top-level bubbles that are anchored on the genome used as reference, and VCFWAVE (v.1.0.3) to homogenize SV representation across samples. Subsequently, raw VCF files were used as an input for pedigree-based filtering of putative de novo SVs.

Filtering of de novo SVs was done using BCFtools (v.1.17) +fill-tags followed by filtering the joint-called VCF for singleton-derived alleles at sites where all samples had a genotype call. By considering all G2/G3 family members (not just trios), we increased de novo SV specificity. We used the command line:

bcftools view -i 'INFO/AC = 1' {VCF FILE} | bcftools +fill-tags -- -t 'all,F_MISSING' | bcftools view -i 'F_MISSING = 0.0' --max-alleles 2 | bcftools view --samples {SAMPLE} | bcftools +fill-tags | bcftools view -i 'INFO/AC = 1' | bcftools view -i '(ILEN < -49 || ILEN > 49)' | bcftools view -i 'QUAL > 49' | vcf2tsv

All candidate de novo SVs collected across all regions of the genomes were further evaluated using phased genome assemblies and long-read alignments. Further details are provided in Supplementary Note 10.

We first extracted an inserted SVA element in the de novo Verkko assembly of NA12887 (maternal haplotype, haplotype 1). Next, we used minimap2 (ref. 80) (v.2.24) to align this ~3.4-kb-long piece of DNA to both maternal and paternal Verkko assemblies using the parameters reported below:


minimap2 -x asm20 -c --eqx --secondary=yes {assembly.fasta} {sva.fasta} > {output.paf}


With these parameters we reported all locations of this DNA segment. We defined a putative donor site as an alignment position in maternal haplotype that has nearly perfect match with SVA de novo insertion.

To identify completely and accurately assembled centromeres from each genome assembly, we first aligned the genome assemblies generated via Verkko16 or hifiasm (UL)17 to the T2T-CHM13 reference genome1 using minimap2 (ref. 80) and the following parameters: -a --eqx -x asm20 -s 5000 -I 10G -t {threads}. We then filtered the whole-genome alignments to only those contigs that aligned to the centromeres in the T2T-CHM13 reference genome. We checked whether these centromeric contigs spanned the centromeres by checking to see whether they contained sequence from the p- and the q-arms in the regions directly adjacent to the centromere. We then validated the assembly of the centromeric regions by aligning native PacBio HiFi data from the same source genome to each whole-genome assembly using pbmm2 (v.1.1.0; https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbmm2) and the following command: align --log-level DEBUG --preset SUBREAD --min-length 5000 -j {threads}, and next assessed the assemblies for uniform read depth across the centromeric regions via NucFreq77 (v.0.1). We also aligned native ONT data >30 kb in length from the same source genome to each whole-genome assembly using minimap2 (v.2.28) and assessed the assemblies for uniform read depth across the centromeric regions using IGV browser93.

To identify de novo SVs and SNVs within each centromeric region, we first aligned each child's genome assembly to the relevant parent's genome assembly using minimap2 and the following parameters: -a --eqx -x asm20 -s 5000 -I 10G -t {threads}. We then used the resulting PAF file to identify de novo SVs and SNVs using SVbyEye85 (v.0.99.0), filtering our results to only those centromeres that were completely and accurately assembled. We checked each SV and SNV call with NucFreq, Flagger9 and native ONT data to ensure that the underlying data supported each call. Further details are provided in Supplementary Notes 9 and 10.

We processed all G1, G2 and G3 assemblies with Tandem Repeats Finder (TRF)91 to determine the existence of the canonical telomeric repeat (p-arm, CCCTAA; q-arm, TTAGGG) within the distal regions of each assembled contig; TRF (v.4.09.1) was run with parameters: '2 7 7 80 10 50 10 -d -h-ngs', recommended for young (in this context, non-deteriorated) repeats as implemented in RepeatMasker (v.4.1.6). The assembled contigs, in turn, were aligned to the T2T-CHM13 reference with minimap2 (ref. 80) (v.2.24) using the asm20 preset to establish the identities of each sequence (that is, whether a given contig represented the whole reference chromosome or a part of it, and whether it should be reverse-complemented to represent it canonically). With identities established, TRF annotations were crawled from the outside in (from the 5′ end on p-arms and from the 3′ end on q-arms, with respect to reverse complementarity as reported by minimap2) until the canonical repeat was encountered; incidences of non-canonical interspersed repeats were also retained.

Moreover, PacBio HiFi reads were mapped to the contigs to assess by how many HiFi reads each region of each assembly was supported (coverage depth); distal regions supported by fewer than five HiFi reads were masked. Of the non-acrocentric chromosome ends across all G1, G2 and G3 samples, 74.2% of the Verkko assemblies (893 out of the possible 1,204 across all participants and haplotypes) were found to terminate in a canonical telomeric repeat (either spanning from the very start or end of the contig, or immediately adjacent to the region masked due to low coverage) with the median length of such repeats being 5,608 bp (Supplementary Table 3). Moreover, out of the T2T-CHM13 chromosomes for which both p and q telomeric ends were recovered, 64.6% (221 out of 342) were represented each by a single assembled contig spanning from the p telomere to the q telomere.

The G4 hifiasm assemblies were processed in the same fashion; however, only 56.8% of the telomeric regions (342 out of the possible 602) were recovered (Supplementary Fig. 3) with a median length of the canonical repeat being 4,674 bp (Supplementary Table 3; same as for G1–G3), and the contiguity was markedly worse: only one chromosome (chromosome 9 in haplotype 1 of individual G4-200101) was verifiably spanned by a single contig (h1tg000017l).

To determine the CpG methylation status of each centromere, we first base called raw ONT data with Guppy (https://community.nanoporetech.com; v.6.5.7) using the sup-prom model and the dna_r9.4.1_450bps_modbases_5hmc_5mc_cg_sup_prom.cfg config file. Next, we aligned the ONT data from each sample to the respective genome assembly using minimap2 (ref. 80) (v.2.28) with the following parameters: -ax lr:hq -y -t 4 -I 8 g. We converted the resulting BAM file to a bedMethyl file using modbam2bed (https://github.com/epi2me-labs/modbam2bed) and the following parameters: -e -m 5mC --cpg -t {threads} {input.bam} > {output.bed}. Next, we converted the bedMethyl file into a bedGraph using the following command: awk ‘BEGIN {OFS=“\t”}; {print $1, $2, $3, $11}' {input.bed} | grep -v “nan” | sort -k1,1 -k2,2n > {output.bedgraph} and subsequently converted the bedGraph into a bigwig using bedGraphToBigWig (https://www.encodeproject.org/software/bedgraphtobigwig/) and then visualized the bigwig file using Integrative Genomics Viewer93,98 (v.2.16.0). To determine the size of a hypomethylated region (termed the CDR2,39) in each centromere, we used CDR-Finder (https://github.com/arozanski97/CDR-Finder), which first bins the bedGraph into 5 kb windows, computes the median CpG methylation frequency within windows containing α-satellite (as determined by RepeatMasker99 (v.4.1.0)), selects bins that have a lower CpG methylation frequency than the median frequency in the region, merges consecutive bins into a larger bin, filters for merged bins >50 kb and reports the location of these bins.

The construction and dating of Y-chromosomal phylogeny for 58 total samples, combining the 14 pedigree males from the current study with 44 individuals, for which long-read-based Y assemblies have previously been published, was done as described previously in detail52. In brief, all sites were called from the Illumina high-coverage data14 of the 14 pedigree males using the approximately 10.4 Mb of Y-chromosomal sequence previously defined as accessible to SRS100. BCFtools101,102 (v.1.16) was used with a minimum base quality 20, mapping quality 20 and ploidy 1. SNVs within 5 bp of an indel call (SnpGap) and all indels were removed, followed by filtering all calls for a minimum read depth of 3 and a requirement of ≥85% of reads covering the position to support the called genotype. The VCF was merged with a similarly filtered VCF from ref. 52 for the 44 individuals using BCFtools, and then sites with ≥5% of missing calls, that is, missing in more than 3 out of 58 samples, were removed using VCFtools103 (v.0.1.16). After filtering, a total of 10,404,104 sites remained, including 13,443 variant sites.

The Y haplogroups of each sample were predicted as previously described104 and correspond to the International Society of Genetic Genealogy nomenclature (ISOGG; https://isogg.org; v.15.73). A coalescence-based method implemented in BEAST105 (v.1.10.4) was used to estimate the ages of internal nodes. RAxML106 (v.8.2.10) with the GTRGAMMA substitution model was used to construct a starting maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree for BEAST. Markov-chain Monte Carlo samples were based on 200 million iterations, logging every 1,000 iterations, with the first 10% of iterations discarded as a burn-in. A constant-sized coalescent tree prior, the GTR substitution model, accounting for site heterogeneity (gamma), and a strict clock with a normal distribution based on the 95% CI of the substitution rate (0.76 × 10−9 (95% CI = 0.67 × 10−9–0.86 × 10−9) single-nucleotide mutations per base pair per year) was used107. A summary tree was produced using Tree-Annotator (v.1.10.4) and visualized using the FigTree software (v.1.4.4).

Detailed analysis of Y-chromosomal DNMs focused on seven male individuals (R1b1a-Z302 Y haplogroup, G1-NA12889, G2-NA12877, G3-NA12882, G3-NA12883, G3-NA12884 and G3-NA12886) for whom phased Verkko assemblies were generated. Contigs containing X- and Y-chromosomal sequences were identified and extracted from the whole-genome assemblies as previously described52. Moreover, the pseudoautosomal regions from the G1 grandmother NA12890 and G2 mother NA12878 genome assemblies were identified by aligning the respective sequences from the T2T-CHM13 reference genome to these assemblies using minimap2 (ref. 80) (v.2.26).

The annotation of Y-chromosomal subregions of the Verkko assemblies was performed using both the GRCh38 and T2T-CHM13 Y reference sequences as previously described52. The centromeric α-satellite repeats for the purpose of Y subregion annotation were identified using RepeatMasker99 (v.4.1.2-p1) with the default parameters. The Yq12 repeat annotations were generated using HMMER108 (v.3.3.2dev) with published DYZ1, DYZ2, DYZ18, 2k7bp and 3k1bp sequences52, followed by manual checking of repeat unit orientation and distance from each other. Dot plots to compare Y-chromosomal sequences were generated using Gepard109 (v.2.0).

Human Y chromosomes vary extensively in the size and composition of repetitive regions52, including the T2T-CHM13 Y (haplogroup J1a-L816) and the R1b1a-Z302 haplogroup Y chromosomes carried by the seven pedigree males (Supplementary Note 6). For this reason, the Y assembly of the G1 grandfather NA12889 was used as a reference for DNM detection. The DNMs were called from the Y assemblies of five G2 (NA12877) and G3 (NA12882, NA12883, NA12884 and NA12886) males using Dipcall82 (v.0.3) with the default parameters recommended for male samples. Variants were identified from the MSY only, that is, the pseudoautosomal regions were excluded from this analysis. All identified variants were filtered as follows: any variant calls overlapping with regions flagged by Flagger or NucFreq in either reference or query assembly were filtered out.

For SNVs, the final filtered calls were supported by 100% of HiFi reads (that is, no reads supported the reference allele in offspring or alternative allele in the father) and ONT reads mapped to both the reference and each individual assembly were checked for support.

For indels (≤50 bp), homopolymer tracts were excluded from the analysis, while the rest of the calls were validated using the read data (HiFi, ONT, Illumina) as follows. Individual reads mapped to the reference (G1 NA12889 Y assembly) and covering the indel call plus 150 bp of flanking sequence were extracted from all samples using subseq (https://github.com/EichlerLab/subseq), followed by alignment using MAFFT110,111 (v.7.508) with the default parameters. All alignments were manually checked and any calls where the HiFi data had two or more reads supporting a reference allele and one or more reads supporting an alternative allele were removed. All final SNV and indel calls were additionally supported (if unique mapping to the region was possible) by both Illumina and Element read data mapped to the reference.

For all SV calls, HiFi read depth for reference and alternative alleles were visualized and SVs in regions showing high levels of read depth variation coinciding with clusters of SNVs with >10% of reads supporting an alternative allele removed. HiFi and ONT reads mapped to both the reference and individual assemblies were checked for support.

For all variants, concordance with the expected transmission through generations was confirmed. Moreover, the HiFi data available for three G4 male individuals (200101, 200102 and 200105) were checked for support of the identified variants.

The assembly-based DNM rates were calculated for each of the five male individuals based on the accessible regions of each individual Y assembly (that is, any regions flagged by Flagger and/or NucFreq were removed).

Mobile element analysis was performed on PacBio HiFi reads using xTea112 (v.0.1.9). Potential non-reference mobile element insertions (MEI) identified with xTea were visualized using IGV to ensure that the insertions were identifiable in the sequencing reads and to determine whether any of these events were de novo. Using BEDTools113, we intersected the non-reference insertions with introns, exons, 5′-UTRs and 3′-UTRs from T2T-CHM13. To identify potential source elements of the non-reference LINE-1 insertions, we used BLAT114 to find the best matching insertion in the T2T-CHM13 reference genome. If there were multiple matches in the reference genome that had the same score, a source element was not called. MEI sequences representing known Alu, L1 and SVA subclasses were obtained from previous work115, Dfam116 and UCSC Genome Browser74. Reference and novel sequences for each MEI class were combined into class-specific files. Sequences were oriented to plus-strand. Highly truncated sequences were removed. MEI sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE117 (v.3.8.31) aligner. Pairwise distances among MEI sequences were calculated using a Kimera two-parameter method and then converted to correlations. Principal components were obtained by eigenvalue decomposition of the pairwise correlation matrix. The first three principal components were plotted to visualize the relationships among the non-reference MEIs and the known MEI subfamily sequences.

a) Scatterplot of sequence read depth and read length N50 for ONT (blue) and PacBio (PB; magenta) with median coverage (dashed line) and different generations indicated (point shape). b) Scatterplot of the assembly contiguity measured in AuN values for Verkko (brown), hifiasm (UL) (light blue), and hifiasm (light grey) assemblies of G1-G4. Note: G4 samples were assembled using PacBio HiFi data (hifiasm) only; hifiasm (UL) refers to hifiasm assemblies integrating both PacBio HiFi and ONT data. c) Top: Total number of Verkko contigs whose maximum aligned bases are within +/−5% of the total T2T-CHM13 chromosome length. *Due to substantial size differences between the T2T-CHM13 Y (haplogroup J1a-L816) and the Y chromosome of this pedigree (haplogroup R1b1a-Z302), three contigs are shown that span the entire male-specific Y region without breaks (i.e., excluding the pseudoautosomal regions). Bottom: Each dot represents a single Verkko contig with the highest number of aligned bases in a given chromosome. d) Chromosomes containing complete telomeres and being spanned by a single contig are annotated as solid squares. In instances where the p- and q-arms are not continuously assembled and for acrocentric chromosomes, we plot diagonally divided and colour-coded triangles. e) Evaluation of centromere completeness across G1-G3 assemblies and across all chromosomes. We mark centromeres assembled by Verkko (brown), hifiasm (UL) (light blue), or both (green).

a) Depiction of intergenerational (G1- > G4) inheritance of a 1 Mbp assembled contig. Alignments transmitted between generations that are >99.99% identical (red) are contrasted with non-transmitted with lower sequence identity (grey). b) T2T recombination between child and parental haplotypes for Chromosome 8. Alignments between the parental and child haplotypes are binned into 500 kbp long bins and coloured based on the percentage of matched bases. Inherited maternal (shades of red) and paternal (shades of blue) segments are marked on top. Dashed arrows show zoom-in of the two recombination breakpoints that differ in size of the region of homology at the recombination breakpoint. Black tick marks show positions of mismatches between parental and child haplotypes. c) Distribution of distances of maternal (red) and paternal (blue) recombination breakpoints (G2-G4) to chromosome ends with respect to T2T-CHM13 (histogram bin size: 50). d) Significant association between the number of recombination breaks (y-axis) and parental age (x-axis) shown separately for maternal (red) and paternal (blue) recombination breakpoints (G2-G3) detected with respect to T2T-CHM13. Regression lines were fitted using Poisson GLM with a log link (p = 2.02 × 10−3, 7.88 × 10−4 for parental age and sex effects, respectively).

a) The fraction of a parent's germline SNVs (green, DNMs) and postzygotic SNVs (purple, PZMs) transferred to each child. b) The mean allele balance (AB) of DNMs (n = 249) and PZMs (n = 55) across HiFi, Illumina, and ONT data plotted against the fraction of children who inherited a variant are significantly correlated for DNMs (two-sided t-test, p = 0.0084) and PZMs (p = 0.00021). Half of PZMs with AB < 0.25 are transmitted to at least one child (n = 18/36). c) On average, DNMs are transmitted to 50% of children, while PZMs are transmitted to less than 25% of children. Boxes represent IQR including median line; whiskers extend to 25%  −  1.5 × IQR and 75%  +  1.5 × IQR, outliers are shown as dots. d) Number of DNMs and PZMs transmitted to each child in the pedigree.

a) Schematic of the generalized organization of human centromeres and their flanking sequence. Major components and their structures are shown. HOR, higher-order repeat. Not drawn to scale. b) Deletion of an 18-monomer α-satellite HOR within the Chromosome 6 centromere of G2-NA12878 is inherited in G3-NA12887, shortening the length of the α-satellite HOR array by ~3 kbp. c) Sequence identity heatmap of the Chromosome 6 centromere in G1-NA128991 shows the high (~100%) sequence identity of α-satellite HORs along the entire centromeric array and at the site of the de novo deletion. d,e) Deletions of α-satellite HORs in regions outside of the centromere dip region (CDR) in the d) Chromosome 4 and e) Chromosome 11 centromeres does not affect the position of the CDR. f,g) Deletions and insertions of α-satellite HORs within the CDR in the f) Chromosome 19 and g) Chromosome 21 centromeres alter the distribution of the CDR.

Metrics details

The maritime Phoenician civilization from the Levant transformed the entire Mediterranean during the first millennium bce1,2,3. However, the extent of human movement between the Levantine Phoenician homeland and Phoenician–Punic settlements in the central and western Mediterranean has been unclear in the absence of comprehensive ancient DNA studies. Here, we generated genome-wide data for 210 individuals, including 196 from 14 sites traditionally identified as Phoenician and Punic in the Levant, North Africa, Iberia, Sicily, Sardinia and Ibiza, and an early Iron Age individual from Algeria. Levantine Phoenicians made little genetic contribution to Punic settlements in the central and western Mediterranean between the sixth and second centuries bce, despite abundant archaeological evidence of cultural, historical, linguistic and religious links4. Instead, these inheritors of Levantine Phoenician culture derived most of their ancestry from a genetic profile similar to that of Sicily and the Aegean. Much of the remaining ancestry originated from North Africa, reflecting the growing influence of Carthage5. However, this was a minority contributor of ancestry in all of the sampled sites, including in Carthage itself. Different Punic sites across the central and western Mediterranean show similar patterns of high genetic diversity. We also detect genetic relationships across the Mediterranean, reflecting shared demographic processes that shaped the Punic world.

Open science principles require making all data used to support the conclusions of a study fully available, and we support these principles here by making publicly available not only the digital copies of molecules (the uploaded sequences) but also the molecular copies (the aDNA libraries themselves, which constitute molecular data storage). Researchers who wish to carry out deeper sequencing of libraries published in this study should make a request to the corresponding author D.R. We commit to granting reasonable requests as long as the libraries remain preserved in our laboratories, with no requirement that we be included as collaborators or co-authors on any resulting publications. The raw DNA sequences for individuals newly sequenced in this study are deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive under accession number PRJEB86313. Their processed genotype data in pseudohaploid eigenstrat format can be obtained from the Harvard Dataverse repository (https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/UPDESR). We include other newly reported data such as radiocarbon dates and archaeological context information in the Article and its Supplementary Information. We plotted the maps in Figs. 1 and 4 using the Python package basemap. The land-sea mask, coastline, lake, river and political boundary data are extracted from the GSHHG datasets (v.2.3.6) using GMT (5.x series). They are included under the terms of the open-source LGPLv3+ license.

We deposited the code for analysing the data and producing the figures in this Article at GitHub (https://github.com/hringbauer/punic_aDNA).

We project individuals sequenced at over 20,000 SNPs onto the same two PCs as in Fig. 1 (calculated from modern individuals, grey dots). Here, we plot all individuals from Punic archaeological sites, excluding the Phoenician site of Akhziv and including the 20 individuals dated to the Roman period (Supplementary Table 5). We split the sample into panels representing our four major geographic regions: Iberia, Sardinia, North Africa, and Sicily. The shape of the symbols indicates the site (lower left legend), and the colour indicates the date range of each individual (as described in the upper right legend).

The 122 Phoenician-Punic individuals sequenced for more than 100,000 SNPs were jointly analysed with 24 individuals from related ancient populations across the Mediterranean (Supplementary Table 12). (a) The model with the highest likelihood was obtained for each value of K among 50 replicate runs. Individuals are grouped based on region. Values of the ΔK score of58 are specified for K = 3,4, with a higher score obtained for K = 3, suggesting optimal fit. (b) A more detailed depiction of the best model obtained with K = 3 latent ancestry components corresponding to North African ancestry (red), eastern ancestry (green), and central/western Mediterranean ancestry (blue). Individuals are partitioned within each region according to site and time range (see legend). The unsupervised ADMIXTURE model does not adequately differentiate between Levantine ancestry and ancestry found in other Mediterranean locations (e.g., Anatolia and Sicily), unlike the qpAdm models of Extended Data Fig. 3.

We partitioned individuals by region: (a) North Africa, (b) Sicily, (c) Sardinia, (d) Iberia, and (e) the Levant. Within each region, we grouped individuals by site, and for sites in Sicily, Sardinia, and Iberia, also by broad date ranges (see legend for colour code). We ordered the models of each individual according to their P-values (grey bar above each model). We report P-values assuming that the LRT statistic is chi-squared distributed with degrees of freedom determined by the number of populations and of contributing source populations. We did not correct these P-values for multiple testing, but this approach is conservative since we report models with comparatively high P-values (those that are not rejected by the test). Individuals with low coverage (fewer than 100,000 SNPs) are indicated by an asterisk (*) next to the sample ID. Eastern ancestry models are indicated by a contribution of the proxy sources Levant MLBA. In contrast, western ancestry models are indicated by contributions from either Greece BA (Myc), Sicily EBA, Sardinia LBA, Iberia LBA, or Steppe MLBA. There are five individuals for whom no valid eastern or western model was inferred. For four of them, we inferred valid models under the broad ancestry scheme (marked by an asterisk above the vertical bar), and for one (I22122 from Tharros, Sardinia), we could not infer any valid model.

We exclude from this analysis the Akhziv sample, the three individuals from Sicily and Sardinia that cluster near Levantine individuals in the 2D PCA, and one individual for which we could not fit a qpAdm model. The qpAdm estimates are based on the smallest proportions estimated for the individual in a valid qpAdm model (see Methods). The PCA-based estimates of North African ancestry were computed by projecting the location of each sample in the PCA onto a cline from the cluster defined by Bronze Age individuals from Sicily to the cluster defined by North African individuals (see Supplementary Information S3 for more details). The two approaches yield similar estimates, with qpAdm being more sensitive to low ancestry proportions. Individuals from Kerkouane (depicted as squares) appear to have a broad range of North African ancestry (0 - 94%). Individuals from Sicily typically have lower proportions of North African ancestry (<20%), and we observe no significant shift in time. On the other hand, in Sardinia, none of the 12 individuals for which we inferred more than 10% North African ancestry (according to at least one of the two approaches) dated before 400 BCE, suggesting that North African ancestry was likely introduced around that time (Supplementary Information S3). We see a similar pattern in Iberia, but since we only have one individual from Iberia dating before 400 BCE, we cannot confidently infer the absence of North African ancestry during this time.

We inferred the first four characters of the ISOGG 2019 Y haplogroup classification for all Phoenician and Punic males with more than 100,000 autosomal SNPs covered (as those in almost all cases have sufficient coverage on the Y chromosome; see Methods). (a) Pie chart of Y haplogroup frequencies. (b) We visualize the Y haplogroup diversity partitioned per Phoenician or Punic site and denote each individual's haplotype by one circle. We set the height of the bar to the overall frequency (as depicted in panel a). The numbers in brackets indicate the total Y haplotype sample size.

(a) Y haplogroup diversity measured using the Inverse Simpson index. This value is computed as in Fig. 3a, excluding the three Punic individuals (from Kerkouane, Villaricos and Selinunte) with distinct North African Y haplogroups E1a and L (see Extended Data Fig. 5). (b) autosomal diversity measured using the first two PCs from Fig. 1 and the mean pairwise distance of those coordinates. This value is computed as in Fig. 3b, excluding individuals with more than 10% North African ancestry based on qpAdm in Phoenician-Punic sites (see Extended Data Fig. 4). Here, we combined individuals from the nearby Sicilian sites of Birgi, Motya, and Lilybaeum into one group (labelled Lilybaeum here). In both panels, the diversity measures for the context populations are as in Fig. 3 (without any additional filtering), and the dashed horizontal bar in both panels indicates the maximum diversity observed in sites dating before 500 BCE. See Supplementary Information S5 for a more detailed description of this analysis.

We reconstructed two pedigrees based on inferring biological relatives with pairwise kinship (using IBD segment sharing) and uniparental haplogroups: (a) A pedigree linking five individuals from Kerkouane, North Africa; (b) A pedigree linking three individuals from Tharros, Sardinia. In the Kerkouane pedigree in (a), individuals I24215 and I24194 are inferred to be 3rd-4th degree relatives of the two siblings I24494 and I24193, but the exact pedigree relationship cannot be resolved. Each panel depicts the projection of the related individuals onto the two major PCs used in Fig. 1. Each pedigree specifies the sample IDs for all individuals, the mitochondrial (maternal) haplogroup and the Y (paternal) haplogroup for males. Both pedigrees contain individuals dating to 800–400 calBCE and link several individuals via the maternal lineage: We infer four identical maternal haplogroups in Kerkouane and a maternal grandfather in Tharros–two observations that are inconsistent with strict patrilocality.

We computed runs of homozygosity (ROH) in all individuals with more than 400,000 SNPs covered and recorded the total length (in cM) of ROHs binned by length into four categories (see legend). We label individuals with at least 50 and 100 cM of their genome in long ROH (>20 cM) with triangle and square marks as in30 - to indicate offspring of close biological parental relatives. (a) ROH in Phoenician and Punic individuals, grouped by site. (b) ROH in individuals from relevant Bronze and Iron Age contexts (as depicted in Fig. 1). (c) Expected ROH for offspring of various cousin matings (according to the degree of relation between parents) and for individuals sampled in populations with small effective size (calculated as described in30).

Ancestry models inferred using qpAdm for individuals from Sicily from (a) the indigenous Iron Age sites of Polizzello and Monte Falcone, (b) from Phoenician sites before Roman expansion (as shown in Extended Data Fig. 3b), and (c) from Punic sites after Roman expansion. Colour horizontal bars indicate radiocarbon dates. The models of each individual are sorted according to their P-values (grey bar above each model). We report P-values assuming that the LRT statistic is chi-squared distributed with degrees of freedom determined by the number of populations and of contributing source populations. We did not correct these P-values for multiple testing, but this approach is conservative since we report models with comparatively high P-values (those that are not rejected by the test). Eastern ancestry models are indicated by a contribution of the proxy source Levant MLBA. In contrast, western ancestry models are indicated by contributions from either Greece BA (Myc), Sicily EBA, Sardinia LBA, Iberia LBA, or Steppe MLBA. There are seven individuals for which no valid eastern or western model was inferred. We inferred valid models under the broad ancestry scheme (marked by an asterisk above the vertical bar) for five of them. Two individuals were inferred to be related through IBD-sharing and are indicated in the figure. The analysis suggests that indigenous populations in Sicily have similar ancestry patterns as observed in the Phoenician sites but without North African ancestry. In later periods, we see the introduction of diverse ancestry sources (Levantine and western Mediterranean), likely associated with the Roman expansion into Sicily. See Supplementary Information S3 for more details.

(a) Bronze and Iron Age reference and Levantine populations. We show the same PCA as in Fig. 1 but focus on the ancient reference populations. (b) Zoom in PCA projections of Levantine populations. We show the same PCA depicted in (a), but zooming into the region where Levantine individuals project. We also include additional Bronze and Iron Age Levant individuals not included in Fig. 1.

Stonehenge offers mysteries aplenty. Just when we think we've solved one, we have to re-solve questions we thought were already answered. Such is the case with the origin story of the Altar Stone—one of the roughly 80-plus stones still on site in southern England. 

The stones of Stonehenge feature a variety of compositions and originate from a number of potential source locations. Scholars previously believed that they knew most of what there was to be known about the Altar Stone—the largest of the non-sarsen stones on site, which is now partially buried beneath two fallen stones. But researchers led by a team from Curtin University may have just upended that history, writing that a stone long believed to originate from Wales actually hails from Scotland. 

By studying the age and chemistry of mineral grains within fragments of the six-ton Alter Stone—a thick sandstone block measuring 16 feet by 3 feet in the center of the iconic Wiltshire circle—the team crafted a chemical fingerprint of the stone. That chemical composition matched that of rocks from northeast Scotland, and clearly differentiated it from Welsh bedrock. 

“Our analysis found specific mineral grains in the Altar Stone are mostly between 1,000 to 2,000 million years old, while other minerals are around 450 million years old,” Anthony Clarke, lead author and Ph.D. student from the Timescales of Mineral Systems Group at Curtin's School of Earth and Planetary Sciences, said in a statement. “This provides a distinct chemical fingerprint suggesting the stone came from rocks in the Orcadian Basin, Scotland, at least 750 kilometers [466 miles] away from Stonehenge.” 

According to English Heritage, the Altar Stone is a large slab of greenish Old Red Sandstone. Recent geological research had pinpointed the source of the stone to the Brecon Beacons area of southeast Wales. But the new study, which was published today in the journal Nature, discounts that reigning theory. 

Richard Bevins, study co-author and professor at Aberystwyth University, said in a statement that with the chemical fingerprint tracing the iconic rock to Scotland, the hunt for its exact point of origin starts now. 

Clarke said that the Scottish origins of the stone raise fascinating question regarding how such a massive stone was transported so far during the Neolithic era of roughly 2,600 BC. It must have required, the authors claim, an unexpectedly advanced transport method and complex societal organization.

“Our discovery of the Altar Stone's origins highlights a significant level of societal coordination during the Neolithic period and helps paint a fascinating picture of prehistoric Britain,” Chris Kirkland, study co-author and Curtin professor, said in a statement. “Transporting such massive cargo overland from Scotland to southern England would have been extremely challenging, indicating a likely marine shipping route along the coast of Britain. This implies long-distance trade networks and a higher level of societal organization than is widely understood to have existed during the Neolithic period in Britain.”

Described as a kind of blue-green, the new color—named “olo”—can only be seen using lasers to manipulate certain photoreceptors.

The human eye is a wonder of evolution, and is our primary window into understanding the known universe that surrounds us. But even despite the hundreds of millions of years that fashioned our irises, formed our retinas, and molded our light-sensitive photoreceptors, our eyes can only see a fraction of the electromagnetic wonders that criss-cross the cosmos. 

And even in this small visible sliver of the electromagnetic pie, some colors remain hidden from our view—until now. In a new paper published in the journal Science Advances, scientists from the University of California Berkeley and the University of Washington describe how they managed to only stimulate the cones in our eyes responsible for interpreting medium wavelength light using laser light. The result was a never-before-seen color.

“The ultimate goal is to provide programmable control over every photoreceptor [light-sensing cell] in the retina,” Fong told Live Science. “Although this has not been achieved to that level, the method we present in the current study demonstrates that a lot of the key principles are possible in practice.”

First, a brief refresher on some elementary biology. The human eye senses light and color thanks to the millions of rods and cones located in the retina. While rods handle low-light conditions and enable dark vision, cones are responsible for bright light and color, and typically come in three flavors: long (L), medium (M), and short-wavelength (S) cones. When mapped to the wavelengths in the visible spectrum, this roughly amounts to L cones interpreting the color red, S cones glimpsing blue, and M cones falling in the middle near an approximation of the color green. (Some people, known as tetrachromats, actually have a fourth rod that sensitive to orange, but that's a story for another time).

Because M cones sit in the middle of the visible spectrum, they mostly overlap with L and S cones, meaning there's no natural light that stimulates M cones exclusively. So, researchers developed a tool—nicknamed Oz for Frank L. Baum's The Wizard of Oz—that mapped a person's retina, isolated the M cones, and then used a laser to specifically stimulate only those middle-of-the-road cones. The result, according to the researchers, was a color that was a type of blue-green no human had ever seen. The team nicknamed the color “olo,” which is a reference to a 3D map of color coded in binary 0,1,0 with “1” indicating the full stimulation of the M cone. 

“Attempting to activate M cones exclusively is shown to elicit a color beyond the natural human gamut, formally measured with color matching by human subjects,” the authors write in the paper. “They describe the color as blue-green of unprecedented saturation.”

Although some scientists remain unconvinced that “olo” is indeed a new color—one vision scientist told The Guardian that the work has “limited value”—Fong and his team hope that further exploration of the retina using Oz could help treat color blindness and other retinal diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa. The tool could also be used to simulate what it would be like to be one of those genetically mutated women (it's mostly women) that have four distinct cones and can see millions more colors than the average human. 

For as much as we think we know when it comes to color, evidently there's more than meets the eye.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly transforming medical applications. However, proprietary models such as GPT-4o face significant barriers to clinical adoption because they cannot be deployed on site within healthcare institutions, making them non-compliant with stringent privacy regulations. Recent advancements in open-source LLMs such as DeepSeek models offer a promising alternative since they allow efficient fine-tuning on local data in hospitals with advanced IT infrastructure. To demonstrate the clinical utility of DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1, we benchmarked their performance on clinical decision support tasks against proprietary LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental. Using 125 patient cases with sufficient statistical power, covering a broad range of frequent and rare diseases, we found that DeepSeek models perform equally well and in some cases better than proprietary LLMs. Our study demonstrates that open-source LLMs can provide a scalable pathway for secure model training enabling real-world medical applications in accordance with data privacy and healthcare regulations.

Metrics details

Immunotherapies for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other cancers are limited by a lack of tumor-specific targets. Here we discover that RNA-binding proteins and glycosylated RNAs (glycoRNAs) form precisely organized nanodomains on cancer cell surfaces. We characterize nucleophosmin (NPM1) as an abundant cell surface protein (csNPM1) on a variety of tumor types. With a focus on AML, we observe csNPM1 on blasts and leukemic stem cells but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells. We develop a monoclonal antibody to target csNPM1, which exhibits robust anti-tumor activity in multiple syngeneic and xenograft models of AML, including patient-derived xenografts, without observable toxicity. We find that csNPM1 is expressed in a mutation-agnostic manner on primary AML cells and may therefore offer a general strategy for detecting and treating AML. Surface profiling and in vivo work also demonstrate csNPM1 as a target on solid tumors. Our data suggest that csNPM1 and its neighboring glycoRNA–cell surface RNA-binding protein (csRBP) clusters may serve as an alternative antigen class for therapeutic targeting or cell identification.

In recent years, there has been a surge in new therapies that target cell surface molecules, including monoclonal antibodies, antibody–drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor T cells1,2,3,4. These approaches have improved overall survival in a variety of cancers, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer and acute leukemia. While the molecular toolkit for targeting cell surface molecules has rapidly expanded, there remain few clinically actionable targets to leverage these approaches. There have been efforts to better understand and characterize cell surface proteins that are differentially expressed between healthy and cancer states using techniques like proteomics, transcriptomics and phage display5,6,7. Despite the emergence of these unbiased techniques, AML has remained challenging to target with surface-directed therapies, as many highly expressed antigens on AML cells are also present on critical healthy tissue, including hematopoietic stem cells.

Anti-CD33 molecules, like the antibody–drug conjugate gemtuzumab ozogamicin8, have seen some success; however, high expression of CD33 on healthy myeloid cells and hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells has been associated with severe hematological and hepatic toxicity, respectively9. Newer approaches studying both the expression and the physical conformation of proteins on the cell surface have demonstrated promising results, such as an antibody fragment targeting an AML-specific conformation of integrin β2 (ref. 10). Another approach that has gained traction has been targeting HLA-restricted peptides, such as WT1 (ref. 11); however, this approach is limited to a fraction of patients who express specific HLA subtypes. Now there are methods to genetically delete surface proteins from healthy hematopoietic tissue to allow AML cytotoxicity with limited off-target effects12; however, this may be technically cumbersome and costly. Although the majority of clinical efforts have focused on canonical cell surface proteins13, such as those containing a transmembrane domain, there appears to be a need to expand our scope.

There are now three examples of RBPs as surface proteins in preclinical cancer models: PABP1 (ref. 14), nucleolin15,16,17,18 and U5-snRNP200 (ref. 19). There are multiple examples of mutated and dysregulated RBPs in AML, such as SF3B1, U2AF1, SRSF2 and NPM1. In adult AML, nearly 30% of all disease occurrences and approximately 60% of those with a normal karyotype are driven by mutations in NPM1 (refs. 20,21). In these patients, C-terminal mutations of NPM1 cause the replacement of a nucleolar localization signal with a novel nuclear export sequence, leading to cytoplasmic localization of the mutant protein (NPM1c)22. However, it has been unclear whether NPM1 (either wild type (WT) or mutated) is present on the cell surface. Outside of leukemia, autoantibodies in the sera from patients with prostate cancer were shown to react with NPM1, while those from healthy controls did not23, indicating potential aberrant cell surface localization leading to immune recognition.

Here, we provide evidence that NPM1 is expressed on the cell surface in a tumor-selective manner. csNPM1 is present on a diverse set of clinically relevant human and mouse leukemia models and forms nanoscale clusters in physical proximity to other csRBPs and glycoRNAs24,25. We demonstrate that csNPM1 is expressed at increased levels in primary AML in comparison to healthy hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). We also optimize a new mouse immunoglobulin (Ig)G2a antibody (mAb2) targeting NPM1, which does not cause toxicity in healthy mice in vivo. mAb2 shows preferential targeting of murine leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and increases survival in murine models of AML while restoring healthy hematopoiesis. csNPM1 is also present on solid cancers cell lines, and, using in vivo models, we find that targeting csNPM1 has anti-tumor activity in murine models of prostate and colorectal (csNPM1-high) cancer but not melanoma (csNPM1 absent). Collectively, we provide evidence of an RBP that can localize selectively to the surface of cancer cells, which could have important therapeutic implications.

Our examination of cell surface proteomes for csRBPs26 identified NPM1 as a putative cell surface protein, with at least seven datasets showing NPM1 enrichment on the cell surface (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Because NPM1 mislocalization is a driver of leukemia, we first examined the subcellular profile of NPM1 across a panel of nine human myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cell lines (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c), one of which harbors the NPM1c mutation (OCI-AML3). We isolated soluble cytosol and crude membrane fractions and assayed for cytosolic β-actin and endoplasmic reticulum membrane-tethered ribophorin I (RPN1), confirming efficient separation of these pools (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). Blotting with an anti-NPM1 (FC8791) antibody produced a robust band corresponding to NPM1 from the cytosolic and membrane-enriched fraction of most cell lines tested (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). Because OCI-AML3 harbors the C-terminal mutated form of NPM1 (NPM1c), we examined its cellular distribution using a commercially available anti-NPM1c antibody. We found that the NPM1c signal was detected in both the cytosol and the membrane fraction of OCI-AML3 cells (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). We next tested whether the WT antibody could bind to the surface of live cells. To directly visualize the cell surface localization of NPM1, we performed confocal imaging of OCI-AML3 and found that, when applied to live cells, anti-NPM1 (FC8791) binds the cell surface in distinct puncta (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1d). To demonstrate the specificity of the antibody, we performed intracellular immunofluorescence on fixed cells, resulting in the expected nucleolar predominance of NPM1 (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1d). To confirm the cell surface pattern seen when staining live cells, we repeated the experiment with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which is a lectin that binds cell surface glycans. We observed robust WGA cell surface staining with colocalized anti-NPM1 (FC8791) signal (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1e), further confirming NPM1 cell surface presentation.

Source data

To assess whether full-length NPM1 or a peptide fragment was presented on the cell surface, we used a sequential biochemical enrichment strategy. Live cell labeling with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, followed by membrane isolation, anti-NPM1 (FC8791) immunoprecipitation and finally western blotting resulted in robust enrichment of NPM1 from K562 membrane fractions (Fig. 1c, left). Using a streptavidin detection reagent on the same material resulted in a specific band migrating at the same molecular weight as NPM1 (Fig. 1c, right), supporting the presence of full-length csNPM1 rather than major histocompatibility complex presentation, as shown in other cases27. As many cell surface proteins are glycosylated, we next investigated whether NPM1 was similarly modified. While NPM1 has no N-glycan sequons, it does have many predicted sites for O-linked N-acetylgalactosamine (Extended Data Fig. 1f). Furthermore, we selectively enriched NPM1 from membrane lysates with a sialic acid-binding lectin (Extended Data Fig. 1g), suggesting that NPM1 can become glycosylated, consistent with a previous report28.

The presence of full-length csNPM1 and the punctate pattern observed with confocal microscopy in Fig. 1a motivated a more detailed investigation of its cell surface organization. We performed super-resolution (SR) single-molecule localization microscopy (Extended Data Fig. 1h) using a primary conjugated anti-NPM1 (FC8791) antibody for staining HL-60 (NPM1-WT) and OCI-AML3 (NPM1c) cells (Fig. 1d–h and Extended Data Fig. 1h). Staining live cells as in Fig. 1a and imaging with diffraction-limited widefield epifluorescent microscopy yielded an expected punctate pattern of csNPM1 (Fig. 1d,f). We obtained SR reconstructions for a total of five OCI-AML3 cells and three HL-60 cells (Supplementary Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1h,i). In both AML models, the SR reconstructions showed csNPM1 forming distinct clusters of apparently uniform size and regular patterning (Fig. 1d–g). We implemented a semi-automated cluster analysis workflow (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1i). The diameter of csNPM1 clusters was on average 119 nm and 165 nm in HL-60 and OCI-AML3 cells, respectively (Fig. 1h). We then determined the number of localizations observed per cluster and the cluster-to-cluster distance. Across both cell lines, clusters were regularly spaced at approximately 300–330 nm apart (Fig. 1h), while the number of localizations was less uniform with clusters of two types: one with 50–80 and a second with 120–140 localizations per cluster (Fig. 1h). Using the SR data, we calculated the approximate number of antibodies bound per cell, finding ~1,000–2,400 and ~3,000–24,000 per cell on HL-60 and OCI-AML3 cells, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). A similar number was obtained by an orthogonal method using quantitative flow cytometry (Extended Data Fig. 1j). Together, the overall distribution of csNPM1 is reminiscent of a tessellated pattern on the cell surface.

Aside from rare examples, RBPs like NPM1 are not commonly thought to occupy the surface of living cells. Our recent work has begun to explore this concept more generally26; however, there remains an overall lack of molecular understanding of what factors may associate with cell surface RBPs. To address this, we adapted a strategy previously used to label glycoRNAs24, csRBPs26 and other proteins29 in proximity to glycan ligands. Using a primary antibody specific to csNPM1, a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was applied, which activates biotin-phenol (protein labeling) or biotin-aniline (RNA labeling) to label cell surface molecules in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1i and Supplementary Table 2). To ensure robust recovery of proximal proteins, we selected the three AML models with the highest csNPM1 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) fold change over isotype: MOLM-13, OCI-AML3 and Kasumi-1 cells (Extended Data Fig. 2a). After capture of the biotinylated proteins and analysis of those hits enriched over the isotype labeling, we examined the enriched Gene Ontology (GO) cellular compartment (CC) terms. Membrane terms were highly enriched, suggesting that our approach was overall successful for assaying components of the cell surface (Fig. 1j). In addition, other GO terms such as cytosol, ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex and nucleoplasm were also enriched (Fig. 1j). At the individual gene level, we found that MOLM-13, OCI-AML3 and Kasumi-1 cells had many unique hits (Fig. 1k, left three bars), and RBPs comprised 61.1%, 60.5% and 71% of the proteins proximal to csNPM1 (Fig. 1k). Notably, NPM1 was found in all three proximity labeling datasets as anticipated from our data above (Supplementary Table 2). Hits found in common between the AML models tested were more likely to be RBPs, as 75.9% of hits found proximal to csNPM1 in at least two cell lines were annotated RBPs (Supplementary Table 2). Together, these data suggest that csNPM1 clusters into distinct RBP-enriched nanodomains on the surface of leukemia cells.

We next assessed the levels of csNPM1 on the nine human cell lines tested in Extended Data Fig. 1b, and, in all lines, live cell staining with the anti-NPM1 (FC8791) antibody demonstrated staining above isotype levels, albeit to different degrees (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a). While cancer cell lines are efficient at growing in vitro, over time, cultures adapt to these conditions, which may select for states that deviate from their in vivo state, where niche environments are important30,31,32. Here, we harvested leukemic marrow from four primary murine leukemia models driven by MLL-AF4 (KMT2A-AFF1), MLL-AF9 (KMT2A-MLLT3), MLL-ENL (KMT2A-MLLT1) and NPM1c, all in a Flt3ITD/+ background33,34. In all four genotypes, we observed cell surface binding with anti-NPM1 (B0556) antibody (Fig. 2b, top), demonstrating that primary murine AML also presents csNPM1. To understand whether this effect was stable ex vivo, we evaluated how csNPM1 changed upon in vitro culture of Npm1cA/+;Flt3ITD/+ AML cells. After 7 days in culture, these cells still robustly expressed csNPM1 (Extended Data Fig. 2b), although direct comparison to the in vivo data is not possible because these samples were analyzed on different days. As compared to the AML cell lines, we saw a larger distribution in the fraction and intensity of csNPM1-positive cells in primary murine AMLs. Whole-cell levels of NPM1 assessed by flow cytometry after fixation and permeabilization demonstrated similar levels and profiles across all four genotypes (Fig. 2b, bottom), suggesting that csNPM1 levels are not purely a product of total cellular abundance. The broad expression of csNPM1 in models with or without NPM1c and the higher expression in models with NPM1c (that is, OCI-AML3 and Npm1cA/+;Flt3ITD/+ murine AML) raises the question of whether both the WT and mutant forms of NPM1 can be presented on the cell surface, especially considering that NPM1c can form heterodimers with WT NPM1 (ref. 35). To explore this, we designed overexpression vectors encoding NPM1-WT or NPM1c with Ty1 N-terminal tags. Using an anti-NPM1 antibody, we found that the overexpression of either NPM1-WT-Ty1 or NPM1c-Ty1 further increased the levels of csNPM1 as compared to those in K562 cells bearing an empty vector (Fig. 2c). Using the anti-Ty1 antibody, we also found that both NPM1-WT-Ty1- and NPM1c-Ty1-expressing cells were detectable by flow cytometry (Fig. 2c), suggesting that both the WT and NPM1c forms are capable of reaching the cell surface. Consistently, cells expressing an empty vector had little binding when stained with the anti-Ty1 antibody (Fig. 2c). In sum, these data suggest that csNPM1 is presented in many in vitro leukemia models and in vivo primary murine AML models, regardless of NPM1 mutation status.

Source data

The FC8791 monoclonal antibody was raised against the C-terminal region of human NPM1. This domain is highly conserved between mice, monkeys and humans (Extended Data Fig. 2c), suggesting that there is a possibility of developing a cross-species reactive antibody, which would be desirable for clinical translation. We sought to develop an antibody derived from a human immune system, thus minimizing the potential risk of anti-drug antibodies in humans36,37. Previously, an NPM1c mutant-specific binder was selected from a human scFv library38. Using this as a baseline, we constructed a mouse IgG2a antibody (mAb2) targeting NPM1 (Extended Data Fig. 2d) and evaluated its binding features. Mouse IgG2a was selected for its capacity to induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity39, which would enable anti-cancer immunity. First, we analyzed the signal of FC8791 and mAb2 from whole-cell lysate as well as extracted membranes, which demonstrated nearly identical banding patterns (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Next, we used mAb2 for live cell flow cytometry, and mAb2 was able to fully shift signal from OCI-AML3 cells above that of the isotype control (Fig. 2d). Evaluation of the binding pattern by confocal microscopy of OCI-AML3 cells showed that both FC8791 and mAb2 formed puncta on the cell periphery (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 2f, top). The distribution of signal was different upon fixation and permeabilization. Specifically, FC8791, which was raised against a 100% NPM1-WT peptide, displayed a highly nucleolar pattern with limited signal from the cytosol (Fig. 2e, bottom). By contrast, mAb2 had a more prominent cytosolic signal while still retaining nucleolar staining (Fig. 2e, bottom), consistent with mAb2 having some specificity for NPM1c, which is mislocalized to the cytoplasm. Co-staining live cells with mAb2 and WGA demonstrated that the mAb2 pattern was restricted to the cell surface (Extended Data Fig. 2g), and co-staining of cells with mAb2 and FC8791 demonstrated overlapping signals (Extended Data Fig. 2h), suggesting a common cell surface target. We also examined the cell surface binding of mAb2 on primary murine MLL-ENL/Flt3ITD/+ bone marrow (BM) cells, which showed poor and non-specific staining with an isotype control antibody, while mAb2 staining produced punctate, cell surface-specific clusters (Extended Data Fig. 2i) as seen on the human AML cell lines.

To validate the specificity of mAb2 using functional genetics, we generated CRISPR–Cas9 NPM1-knockout cells using the OCI-AML2 cell line. Upon genetic ablation of NPM1, we lost cell surface mAb2 binding, while surface expression of CD47 remained unchanged (Extended Data Fig. 2j,k), suggesting that mAb2 loss was not a non-specific finding. Finally, to further explore the csRBP clustering phenotype we observed with csNPM1 and given that we have also found glycoRNAs in proximity to other csRBP clusters26, we performed an RNA proximity labeling experiment on OCI-AML3 cells with mAb2. RNA from cells stained with mAb2 and then labeled with biotin-aniline revealed a high-molecular-weight biotin smear that was sensitive to RNase and sialidase (Fig. 2f), which is consistent with cell surface glycoRNA labeling24. Together, these data suggest that mAb2 targets csNPM1 and that this RBP is in proximity to glycoRNAs.

Given the presence of csNPM1 on primary murine models of AML and human cell lines, we next assessed its presence on primary human AML. We obtained cryopreserved BM aspirates from healthy donors and patients with AML and performed flow cytometry using a myeloid leukemia panel (CD45, CD34, CD117, CD33, CD13, HLA-DR). Malignant blasts were coarsely identified as side scatter (SSC) low (SSClo) and CD45dim (Fig. 3a, middle, and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Across 12 BM aspirates (set A), including the gating example from patient 3 (Fig. 3a), the blast population generally showed a robust shift above isotype control with mAb2 (Fig. 3b). We next expanded our primary sample cohort to 31 patient samples encompassing various genotypes and immunophenotypes, including primary and secondary AMLs (that is, progressing from myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative neoplasm) (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 3). AML blasts consistently showed a substantially enriched csNPM1 population as compared to the isotype control (Fig. 3d). Despite the set A patients having a wide range of identified mutations through genetic analysis (Fig. 3c), all except patient 8 demonstrated clear mAb2 binding (Fig. 3b). Most profiles were unimodal, with between 21% and 54% of cells being mAb2+ (Fig. 3b, for example, AML BM 3, 5 and 9–12). Next we compared the relative binding efficacy of mAb2 to that of FC8791, which is a well-studied anti-NPM1 antibody (Extended Data Fig. 3b). On OCI-AML3 and two primary patient samples, we observed that both antibodies bind the malignant SSCloCD45dim populations, while mAb2 consistently showed higher MFI. We then examined whether mAb2 could also target csNPM1 in primary murine AML models by performing live staining followed by flow cytometry analysis, finding that mAb2 could bind these cells as well, driven by Npm1cA/+;Flt3ITD/+, MLL-AF9/Flt3ITD/+, MLL-ENL/Flt3ITD/+ and Npm1c;NrasG12D/+ (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Overall, the broadly observed and high levels of mAb2 binding on AML BM suggest that csNPM1 could serve as a genotype-agnostic marker of AML.

Although mAb2 strongly stains cancer cells, avoiding healthy HSPCs will be critical to avoid the associated toxicities seen with other AML targets (that is, CD33 and CD123)40. To understand in detail where, and to what degree, csNPM1 is presented on healthy cells, we studied this in both human and primary mouse models. We examined this by measuring mAb2 binding on B cells (CD19), T cells (CD3), myeloid cells (CD33) and HSPCs (CD34). In both human peripheral blood (PB) and BM from healthy donors, there was minimal binding in T lymphocytes and stronger binding in CD33+ myeloid cells, while B lymphocytes showed higher binding in BM than in PB (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). Both CD33+SCChi (neutrophils) and CD33+SSClo (monocytes) had ~70% mAb2 binding. To understand how this degree of positivity compares to a malignant state, we assessed the MFI for mAb2 across BM cell populations and the OCI-AML3 human AML cell line (Extended Data Fig. 4c). On average, lineage-differentiated BM populations showed tenfold less binding intensity than OCI-AML3 cells. Next, examining CD45dimCD34+ cells (HSPCs), we found an approximate tenfold reduction in binding compared to lineage cells and an approximate 100-fold lower binding than that on OCI-AML3 cells (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Thus, while a subpopulation of healthy hematopoietic cells are stained by mAb2 (percent positive), the total amount of antibody binding (MFI) is significantly less on healthy human cells than in a human AML model.

We next assessed mAb2 binding on healthy mouse hematopoietic cells. Similar to our findings with human samples, mAb2 binding was preferentially seen in BM neutrophils (MAC1+GR1+) and monocytes (MAC1+GR1−), ranging between 20% and 30% of each population (Extended Data Fig. 4d). There was ~10% binding in BM T and B cells. Again, we found low-level binding on mouse hematopoietic progenitors (lineage negative (Lin−)Kit+) and stem cells (Lin−Kit+SCA1+) (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e). Due to limited binding on HSPCs, we predicted that mAb2 would have a minimal impact on normal hematopoiesis.

Significance as in a.

To examine the potential toxicity that mAb2 treatment might have in vivo, we used WT (C57BL/6J) mice and injected them intraperitoneally (i.p.) with three different doses (2.5, 5 and 10 mg kg−1) of mAb2 or an isotype control (5 mg kg−1). No significant differences were observed in PB counts or the total body weight of mice after 4 weekly treatments at any given dose (Extended Data Fig. 5a). At the end of treatment, no significant weight differences were observed in the spleens, livers or kidneys (Extended Data Fig. 5b). We next examined the impact of mAb2 treatment in sublethally irradiated mice. After weekly injections of 10 mg kg−1 of mAb2 or 5 mg kg−1 of isotype control, there were no differences in blood counts or total body weight between treatment arms after 4 weeks (Extended Data Fig. 5c). These mice were kept for 5 additional weeks after the final treatment, and there were still no detectable health issues or tissue weight changes observed (Extended Data Fig. 5d). Overall, these data suggest that the mAb2 antibody is well tolerated and shows no transient or lasting toxicity on normal hematopoiesis in vivo.

To establish whether mAb2 has anti-leukemic efficacy, we first used a primary mouse AML model driven by Npm1cA/+;Flt3ITD/+/RosaCas9/+. This model possesses the highest levels of csNPM1 among the primary murine models tested (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3c). We used sublethally irradiated, immunocompetent mice, which were injected with primary murine Npm1cA/+;Flt3ITD/+/RosaCas9/+ AML cells. After AML engraftment, mice were treated weekly with either isotype control or mAb2 at 5 mg kg−1. Examining the PB 4 weeks after treatment, mice treated with mAb2 had significantly lower levels of the Cas9 transgene than those given the isotype control (Fig. 4a). Moreover, we observed significantly lower white blood cell counts in mice treated with mAb2 than in those treated with the isotype control, indicating decreased leukemic burden. With improved leukemia control, there was hematopoietic recovery, as shown by white blood cell counts, red blood cells and hemoglobin returning to irradiation-only control levels (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Because splenomegaly is one of the key indicators of AML engraftment and expansion in vivo, we examined spleen sizes and found that the mAb2-treated cohort had significantly smaller spleens than the isotype-treated cohort (Fig. 4b). Finally, examination of the overall survival demonstrated that weekly i.p. treatment with mAb2 significantly prolonged survival when compared to the isotype-treated cohort (Fig. 4c). Overall, our results show that mAb2 treatment impaired leukemic engraftment and expansion in a primary murine Npm1cA/+;Flt3ITD/+/RosaCas9/+ AML model while significantly prolonging survival.

Based on mAb2's efficacy in high-csNPM1 models, we next assessed its in vivo efficacy in AML models with lower levels of csNPM1. We used the primary murine MLL-AF9/Flt3ITD/+ AML model, which showed an intermediate amount of mAb2 binding (Extended Data Fig. 3c). These cells, which contain a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) marker, were transplanted and treated as above. We observed that the AML burden (YFP+) in PB was significantly lower in the mAb2-treated cohort than in the cohort treated with the isotype control after just 72 h of treatment (Fig. 4d). Total blood counts further showed that markers of leukemia were reduced in the treated cohort, while again red blood cells, hemoglobin and platelets were all increased, suggesting improved hematopoiesis (Extended Data Fig. 6c). Notably, the leukemia-infiltrated spleen, liver and lungs were significantly smaller in the mAb2-treated cohort than in the cohort treated with the isotype control, suggesting strong anti-leukemic efficacy in those tissues (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 6d). Treatment with mAb2 significantly prolonged survival (Fig. 4f), indicating that mAb2 can also effectively target AML with intermediate csNPM1 levels.

To establish the killing mechanism of mAb2, we transplanted MLL-AF9/Flt3ITD/+ AML into immunocompromised mice (NOD severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) gamma (NSG)), which lack natural killer cells to participate in Fc-mediated ADCC and also have an impaired complement system. In NSG mice, we did not observe any differences in the overall survival or the spleen size of mice treated with mAb2 compared to the isotype control (Fig. 4g,h). These findings suggest that mAb2's mechanism of action is dependent on ADCC and/or complement-dependent cytotoxicity. To further investigate our findings, we used CB17-SCID mice, which are deficient in B and T cells but have intact innate immunity, including complement41. CB17-SCID mice harboring human OCI-AML3 cells had significantly improved survival in the mAb2-treated cohort (Fig. 4i), solidifying that the anti-leukemic effect we observe is immune mediated.

Finally, to assess whether mAb2 has the potential to target human AML patient cells in vivo, we performed flow cytometry analysis to examine csNPM1 levels in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model driven by an MLL rearrangement (MLL-R), which is seen in 40% of pediatric leukemia and 5–12% of adult AML42. We found high csNPM1 levels on the engrafted PDX model, whereas the host mouse BM had significantly lower csNPM1 levels (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f). Finally, mAb2 treatment of CB17-SCID mice bearing this PDX led to significant survival prolongation (Fig. 4j) and reduced PDX engraftment (Fig. 4k). These results suggest that mAb2 is highly efficacious in vivo and in the context of clinically relevant human AML.

It has been reported that IL-7R−Lin−Sca-1−c-Kit+CD34+FcγRII/III+ GMP-like leukemic cells (L-GMP) and CD93+ subpopulations are linked to the generation and maintenance of AMLs driven by MLL43,44. Using the primary murine MLL-AF9/Flt3ITD/+ AML model (treatment as in Fig. 4d), we detected considerable csNPM1 levels on the surface of L-GMP+ and CD93+ populations compared to the isotype control (Fig. 5a). Additionally, there was a significant reduction of L-GMP+ and CD93+ subpopulations in the mAb2-treated cohort when compared to the isotype control-treated mice (Fig. 5b). To show that mAb2 treatment leads to functional impairment of leukemic stem cells, we performed secondary transplantations using the engrafted BM from leukemic mice treated with either mAb2 or isotype control (treated as in Fig. 4d). Following secondary transplantation, mice were left untreated, and we observed that secondary recipients from the mAb2 cohort showed improved overall survival as compared to the isotype control (Fig. 5c). These results indicate that mAb2 treatment targets AML stem cell- or leukemia-propagating compartments.

Furthermore, to assess the potential of csNPM1 as a marker of leukemia initiation and progression, we examined mAb2 surface staining of isogenic primary murine BM HSPCs (Lin−) from WT, Npm1cA/+ or Npm1cA/+;Flt3ITD/+ mice. In this model, Npm1cA/+ has a preleukemic phenotype, while Npm1cA/+;Flt3ITD/+ mice have overt leukemia. There was a clear ‘stage-dependent' increase in mAb2 surface binding where Npm1cA/+;Flt3ITD/+ cells had evidently more csNPM1 than the isogenic Npm1cA/+ preleukemic cells or the WT BM, which had little to no surface binding (Fig. 5d). In summary, these findings suggest that csNPM1 may be preferentially expressed in the leukemia-initiating cell fraction in murine models of leukemia.

To explore csNPM1 binding on the HSPC population from primary patient leukemia samples, we coarsely defined HSPCs as CD45dimCD3−CD19−CD34+ cells45. As expected, this immature population was in low abundance in healthy BM (Fig. 5e, set B) and poorly stained with mAb2 over the isotype signal (13.4% positive; Fig. 5e). Examining a BM aspirate from a patient with AML demonstrated a markedly expanded CD45dim population, representing malignant blasts. This patient's blasts had aberrant CD19 expression, which is a relatively common phenomenon in AML46. Within this sample, there was a minor population of CD19−CD3−CD34+ HSPCs, which were demonstrably better bound by mAb2, both in percent positive (63%) and fluorescent intensity (Fig. 5f).

To understand how this pattern appears across AML patient sample set B (three healthy and six AML BM aspirates), we first looked at all CD45+ cells, where 34–54% of healthy and 14–61% of AMLs were mAb2+, with the reference OCI-AML3 being 100% positive (Fig. 5g). However, when next considering the CD45dimCD34+CD3−CD19− stem-like population, only 8–13% of healthy samples but 25–75% of AML samples were mAb2+ (Fig. 5g). Motivated by the intensity difference seen between Fig. 3a,b, we next quantified the MFI of mAb2 binding on CD45dimCD34+CD3−CD19− HSPCs. HSPC populations from AML samples had significantly higher MFI values of mAb2 binding than the homogeneously low MFI values observed on healthy HSPCs (Fig. 5h). This set of healthy and patient BM samples suggests that, by both fraction bound and intensity bound, mAb2 selectively binds csNPM1 on the surface of primitive malignant cells. We expanded this type of analysis to examine the 13 patient samples in set C (Fig. 5i and Extended Data Fig. 7a–c). NPM1c leukemic blasts are generally CD34 negative, unlike most other AML subtypes. However, studies characterizing the minor fraction of CD34+ cells from NPM1c samples show that mutated NPM1 protein can also be found in this subset. Additionally, when CD34+ cells from NPM1c samples are transplanted, they can reconstitute a CD34− leukemia, thus suggesting that CD34+ cells from NPM1c are leukemia-initiating cells47. First looking at one patient with AML (set C, AML BM 12), we observed that csNPM1 expression among CD45dim cells was predominantly within the CD34+ fraction (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Analyzing the other 12 patients as well as CD34+ enriched healthy donor cells showed that csNPM1 was upregulated in the CD34+ subset of all AML samples (Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). The CD45dimCD34+ fraction from NPM1c samples had the most csNPM1 signal as compared to CD34− blasts. Overall, in human samples, there is a clear preferential binding for csNPM1 in the HSPC population of malignant marrow that is not present in healthy marrow. Additional studies will be needed to assess whether this binding is preferential to bona fide human leukemic stem cells.

Given the genotype-agnostic binding of mAb2 across a diverse set of AML models and primary samples, we hypothesized that csNPM1 could also mark solid tumors. To assess this, we measured mAb2 binding across 47 human and mouse solid tumor models from various tissue origins using flow cytometry (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 4). We saw varying degrees of mAb2 binding in multiple tissue types. There was no binding in B16F10 murine melanoma and little binding in multiple models of human pancreatic cancer. Given the binding on solid tumors, we next sought to assess whether we could achieve in vivo efficacy with mAb2. We turned to a syngeneic model of prostate cancer, in which primary normal murine prostate epithelial cells had little to no mAb2 binding while primary murine prostate carcinoma cells (Pten−/−;Trp53−/−) had clear staining above isotype (Fig. 6b). After engrafting syngeneic tumors in C57BL/6 mice, animals were treated on days 5, 7 and 9 with 10 mg kg−1 of mAb2 or isotype control. We found that mAb2 treatment reduced the tumor volume, while isotype-treated animals had significantly larger tumors at 14 and 17 days after engraftment (Fig. 6c,d). To extend this observation beyond prostate carcinoma, we also evaluated the activity of mAb2 against a murine colorectal cancer model (MC38) that is also bound by mAb2 (Fig. 6e). In this syngeneic model, we also observed significant reduction in tumor volume at 10 and 13 days after transplantation in C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 6f,g). Finally, to establish the specificity of this effect, we examined the activity of mAb2 on the murine melanoma line B16F10, which has no significant mAb2 binding (Fig. 6a,h). As expected, treatment of B16F10-transplanted syngeneic mice with mAb2 has no impact on tumor volume when compared to isotype-treated controls (Fig. 6i). These data suggest that mAb2 induces anti-tumor activity in vivo in csNPM1-positive solid tumors.

Source data

Here, we show that NPM1, a frequently mutated protein in AML and an often dysregulated protein in malignancy, can be found on the cell surface. Because csRBPs such as NPM1 lack a transmembrane domain and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked anchors, we focused on the molecular organization of csNPM1 by combining mass spectrometry (MS) and SR microscopy methods. Cell surface proximity labeling defined many other csRBPs and glycoRNAs within the molecular neighborhoods of csNPM1, consistent with our recent observation of csRBP clusters (for example, DDX21, hnRNP-U, etc.) on other cell types26. Similarly, the SR reconstructions of csNPM1 on AML cells are highly similar to those of DDX21 and hnRNP-U on adherent cell lines26; such a non-random, structured organization suggests the existence of an underlying regulatory mechanism guiding the nanoscale arrangement of these clusters.

Although this study does not fully elucidate the mechanism that drives the surface expression of csNPM1, we do identify that csNPM1 from membrane fractions is bound by sialic acid-specific lectins. Given the predicted O-linked glycosylation sites in NPM1, these findings would suggest that NPM1 can be glycosylated. Protein glycosylation is not only critical to appropriate folding, but it can dictate trafficking, which may in turn be indispensable for NPM1's cell surface localization. Interestingly, others have identified that cell surface nucleolin is glycosylated, and this modification is important for its localization48. There is much to be learned about the mechanisms that govern how csRBPs are glycosylated and how this might relate to malignancy.

Aberrant protein expression and localization is a common feature of malignancies. Recent work from our groups has shown that the glycoRNA–csRBP clusters can serve as regulators of cell-penetrating peptide entry26, while others have shown that csRBPs can bind viruses and mediate ligand internalization49. Given these findings and the commonality of csNPM1 in multiple models of malignancy shown here, this suggests that csNPM1 and its molecular neighborhood on the cell surface may play a functional role in tumorigenesis. Future work enabled by new tools to manipulate csRBPs directly could allow for a direct understanding of csNPM1's (and that of other csRBPs) impact on cellular state.

In this study, we focused on csNPM1 as a target for opsonization and immune-mediated destruction of target cells. This approach, if successfully translated to humans, offers substantial advancements in existing anti-cancer therapies. First, csNPM1 expression was mutation agnostic, which enables its potential use in a multitude of patients. Current advancements in AML therapy have used small molecules that work on a subset of patients based on their driver mutations50,51. Second, other approved anti-AML therapies that are not mutation specific work by inducing DNA damage, which can cause off-target toxicities52. Within the healthy hematopoietic system, csNPM1 has limited expression and importantly is not present on healthy HSCs. Whereas most approved therapies drive life-threatening cytopenias by also affecting normal hematopoiesis53, we do not see this in mouse models. Upon mAb2 treatment of mice with AML, we saw improvement in blood counts, which indicate simultaneous eradication of leukemia and unperturbed normal hematopoiesis.

Furthermore, there were no observable weight changes in mice to suggest broader toxicity, which is reassuring, as NPM1 is well conserved between humans and mice. Ultimately, non-human primate and human studies will be needed to assess whether csNPM1 is expressed on vital non-hematopoietic tissue. If it was expressed on healthy tissues, one interesting prospect is to develop antibodies against mutant NPM1, as we observed both WT and mutant forms on NPM1-mutant models. By targeting a mutant form with an antibody, one could limit off-target effects further. Interestingly, given that there are other RBPs mutated in AML54, if they are also found to be on the cell surface, they could represent novel targets.

Finally, an important goal in AML therapy development has been to target leukemic stem cells55. In our mouse models, we indeed see that csNPM1 is a marker of LSCs, which may in part explain the significant survival benefit offered by anti-csNPM1 therapy. Although our study is not powered to assess human LSCs, we do see increased anti-NPM1 expression in the CD34+ fraction of NPM1c AML marrow, which is notable for having CD34− blasts. This would suggest that there is a primitive population that has csNPM1 in these samples, which we do not observe in healthy BM tissue. Phenotypically, LSCs are defined by their ability to initiate leukemia in limiting dilution transplantation experiments55. Therefore, a focus of future efforts will be to characterize csNPM1+ leukemic cells in transplantation models that have been created to foster human leukemogenesis. LSCs are better characterized in mouse leukemia models43,44, and, as we illustrated in this study, csNPM1 is upregulated in well-defined and clinically relevant murine LSCs.

The finding of csNPM1 prompts a need to reevaluate cell surface proteomics to ensure that non-canonical findings are studied, rather than discarded as noise. With multiple examples now of cancer-specific csRBPs (csNPM1, cs-U5 snRNP200 (ref. 19), etc.), there is a clear need to better investigate their biology in other normal and abnormal contexts. Beyond monoclonal antibodies, these proteins could serve as optimal targets for antibody–drug conjugates and chimeric antigen receptor cell products, thus bringing novel therapies to the patients who need them most.

Normal prostate tissue was derived from Rosa26-LSL-Cas9 knockin mice on B6J (strain 26175, Jackson Laboratory), and Pten−/−;Trp53−/− prostate tumors were derived from a mouse model of prostate cancer of the same genetic background similar to Feng et al.57. Tissues were minced into small pieces and transferred into a gentleMACS C tube (Miltenyi Biotec) for enzymatic digestion using the Multi Tissue Dissociation Kit 1 (130-110-201, Miltenyi Biotec). Digestion was performed in a gentleMACS Dissociator using the program 37C_Multi_A. Following enzymatic dissociation, the cell suspension was pelleted, resuspended and filtered through a 70‐μm cell strainer. Normal and tumoral dissociated prostate cells were cultured as 3D organoids using the protocol and medium composition described by Drost et al.58. Cultures were maintained under these conditions for 6–7 days to enrich for epithelial cells, after which cells were maintained as monolayer cultures on plates coated with collagen I (354236, Corning) using the same medium composition.

K562 cells were cultured as above. Cell surface protein labeling was accomplished using sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (APExBIO) as described above, after which crude membrane fractions were isolated. To obtain cytosolic and membrane fractions24, suspension cells were directly resuspended in membrane isolation buffer (10 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 250 mM sucrose (Sigma), 1 mM EDTA) at 5 million cells per 1 ml. Adherent cells were collected off the plate by scraping in ice-cold PBS, pelleted and then similarly resuspended at 5 million cells per 1 ml of membrane isolation buffer. Cells were rested on ice for up to 5 min, moved to a glass Dounce homogenizer (Sigma) and then homogenized using 40–80 strokes to obtain a resuspension of approximately 50% released nuclei. Overdouncing can cause nuclear rupture and contamination of the cytosolic fraction. After douncing, unbroken cells and nuclei were pelleted by centrifuging at 4 °C for 10 min at 700g. Supernatants (cytosol and membranes) were carefully transferred to a new tube, and pellets were discarded. The supernatants were again centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 10,000g. Most (90%) of the supernatant was removed and saved as cytosolic fractions. The remaining supernatant was discarded, as it was near to the membrane pellet. The membrane pellet was gently washed with 500 µl of ice-cold 1× PBS (the pellet was not resuspended here), the tube was centrifuged briefly, and all supernatant was discarded to leave a cleaned membrane pellet. Finally, the membrane pellet was resuspended in 500 µl CLIP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl (Sigma), 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.1% NP-40, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine). Both the cytosolic and membrane lysates were stored at −80 °C for later processing. After isolation and solubilization with CLIP lysis buffer, total protein quantification occurred using the BCA assay. For each sample, 5 μg protein was used for input, and 20 μg was used for either anti-NPM1 (FC8791)-coated bead protein A Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or streptavidin-coated bead (MyOne C1 beads, Thermo Fisher Scientific) enrichments. In both cases, 10 μl bead surrey was added to the membrane lysates in 100 μl of CLIP lysis buffer, and binding occurred at 4 °C for 16 h. After binding, the beads were washed three times with high-stringency buffer and then twice with 1× PBS. Proteins were released from the beads by heating at 85 °C for 10 min in 20 µl 1× LDS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1 mM free biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Input and enriched proteins were analyzed by Western blot, staining with anti-NPM1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-32256, FC8791) and streptavidin IR800 (LI-COR Biotechnology) and finally scanning on a LI-COR Odyssey CLx scanner. Fractionation as described above was performed without cell surface biotinylation for data in Fig. 1a, and western blots were developing using anti-NPM1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-32256, FC8791), anti-NPM1c (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 32-5200), anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-47778) and anti-RPN1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-48367) antibodies.

VH and VL sequences were grafted to the constant region of the mouse IgG2a heavy chain and the mouse λ light chain, respectively, to generate a new mouse antibody (mAb). These sequences were given to Curia Global. At Curia, the gene synthesis process involves overlapping oligonucleotide synthesis and assembly, followed by cloning into Curia's proprietary high-expression mammalian vector. Production and mAb quality control were performed by Curia to produce a protein A-purified IgG fraction with low endotoxin (<1 EU per mg IgG) in 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4.

Cells were cultured as described above and directly counted. Typically, 50,000 cells were used and blocked with Human TruStain FcX (Fc block, BioLegend) or Mouse TruStain FcX (Fc block, BioLegend) in flow cytometry buffer (0.5% BSA (Sigma) in 1× PBS) for at least 15 min on ice; cells were kept on ice from this point forward. For intracellular staining (‘fix–perm'), cells were first fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min at 25 °C, rinsed once with 1× PBS and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 10 min at 25 °C and finally rinsed once with 1× PBS. For cell surface staining (‘live cell'), cells were processed directly after live Fc blocking on ice. Precomplexed antibodies were added to live or fixed cells. To precomplex, primary unconjugated antibodies including mouse isotype (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2025) and anti-NPM1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-32256, FC8791) and anti-Ty1 tag (Diagenode) were bound in solution (precomplexed) to a goat anti-mouse AF647 secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A32728) or a goat anti-mouse AF488 secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A28175) for at least 30 min on ice before use. The molar ratio was 2:1 (primary:secondary). To the blocked cells, precomplexed antibody was added at a final concentration of 1 µg ml−1 (primary antibody) and allowed to bind to cells for 60 min on ice. After staining, cells were centrifuged at 4 °C for 3 min at 400g, and the supernatant was discarded. All cell centrifugation steps took place using these conditions. Cells were washed once with 150 µl flow cytometry buffer, centrifuged under the same conditions and finally resuspended in flow cytometry buffer containing 0.1 µg ml−1 DAPI. Data collection occurred on a BD Biosciences LSRFortessa 3, and a gating strategy was used to isolate live single cells to examine antibody binding using FlowJo software (version 10, BD).

The frozen PB and BM samples obtained from healthy donors as well as patients with AML were processed with care to ensure as little cell lysis and high viability after thawing. Vials were warmed in a 37 °C water bath for 2–3 min and then completely thawed in 5 ml of ice-cold flow cytometry buffer. Cells were pelleted from this initial resuspension at 400g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and cells were resuspended in 1 ml of fresh ice-cold flow cytometry buffer and counted. For each sample, 1 million cells per ml were taken for Fc blocking and staining according to the above protocol. Next, we stained the cells using the live protocol with the precomplexed isotype or anti-NPM1 (mAb2) antibodies for 30 min on ice in 100 µl flow cytometry buffer. After that, we centrifuged the cells and discarded the supernatant as before. The cells were then stained again with 200 ng of dye-conjugated cell type-specific antibodies (anti-human CD45 (HI30), 304024; anti-human CD34 (581), 343516; anti-human CD117 (104D2), 313204; anti-human CD33 (WM53), 303416; anti-human CD13 (WM15), 301710; anti-human HLA-DR (L243), 307604; anti-human CD3 (OKT3), 317308; and/or anti-human CD19 (HIB19), 302206; all BioLegend) on ice for 30 min in 100 µl flow cytometry buffer. Finally, the cells were pelleted again, the supernatant was discarded, one 200-µl flow cytometry buffer wash was performed, and the cells were finally resuspended in 200 µl flow cytometry buffer with 0.1 µg ml−1 DAPI for flow cytometry analysis. Healthy donor and AML patient samples were obtained with informed consent under (1) UK ethical approval (IRAS reference 340167, previously 149581, REC 07-MRE05-44). Additionally, healthy donor and AML patient samples were collected from patients located at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) or Brigham and Women's Hospital (USA). Samples were then processed and banked in the Pasquarello Tissue Bank in accordance with IRB-22-160 at the DFCI; we obtained assistance from the Hematologic Malignancies Data Repository to identify patient samples from the tissue bank that were bona fide AML. The HMDR also provided relevant information regarding disease characteristics, such as cytogenetics, mutations and immunophenotype. Samples were banked in accordance with DFCI Protocol 01-206: tissue and data collection for research studies in patients with hematologic malignancies, BM disorders and normal donors. Sample characteristics were obtained using DFCI IRB Protocol 22-160. This is a DFCI-specific tissue-banking protocol, which is not available publicly for review, but it can be shared upon request.

For suspension cells, culturing, counting and Fc blocking were carried out as described above. Samples for ‘live cell' imaging were processed according to the live cell flow cytometry protocol noted above; however, after staining and washing, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (37% stock, Sigma) for 30 min at 25 °C. Primary and secondary antibodies noted above were used but sequentially, rather than precomplexed: primary antibody was added at a final concentration of 2.5 µg ml−1 for 45 min on ice in flow cytometry buffer. After staining, cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and then stained with a secondary antibody at a final concentration of 2.5 µg ml−1. Secondary stains occurred for 30 min on ice and in the dark, after which cells were washed once with 1× PBS. A final fixation for ‘fix–perm' samples was performed in parallel with the ‘live cell' samples with 3.7% formaldehyde in 1× PBS for 30 min at 25 °C in the dark. Nuclei were stained with 0.1 µg ml−1 DAPI in flow cytometry buffer for 15 min at 25 °C. Suspension cells were applied to glass slides using a Cytospin centrifuge (Fisher Scientific): this was accomplished by centrifugation at 500g for 5 min in a Cytospin 1867. Finally, cells were mounted in ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and a coverglass was sealed over the sample with nail polish. All samples were then imaged on a Leica TCS SP8 STED ONE microscope. For all experiments, at least three regions of interest were acquired using a ×63 oil-immersion objective across one or more z slices. Leica's line-sequential scanning method was used, and images were acquired at 1,024-by-1,024 resolution with a pinhole size of 1 AU. The DAPI channel was acquired with a PMT detector, while all other channels were imaged using hybrid detectors. For Extended Data Fig. 2i, the DAPI channel was imaged using a hybrid detector, and images were analyzed using ImageJ (version 1.54f). Next, using Imaris Microscopy Image Analysis software (Oxford Instruments), single slices of the confocal stack were analyzed.

Cells were prepared as described above for live cell imaging. Here, primary conjugated antibodies (AF647) were used directly for cell labeling and included mouse isotype (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-24636-AF647) and anti-NPM1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-32256-AF647, FC8791). To avoid cell movement during the SR acquisition, cells were immobilized on a glass-bottom plate precoated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma, P4707) and Cell-Tak (Corning, 354240). An overview of the method and processing can be found in Extended Data Fig. 3a. For single-molecule SR microscopy, we used direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy. To perform this, the PBS in which the cells were stored was replaced by a reducing oxygen scavenging buffer to induce blinking of fluorophores as described in the literature59. The blinking buffer consisted of 2 μl ml−1 catalase (Sigma), 10% (wt/vol) glucose (BD Biosciences), 100 mM Tris-HCl (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 560 μg ml−1 glucose oxidase (Sigma) and 20 mM cysteamine (Sigma). First, diffraction-limited images were obtained with low-intensity illumination of few W cm−2. Next, the laser power was increased to approximately 3 kW cm−2. Image acquisition was started after a short delay to ensure that most fluorophores were shelved into a dark state. The exposure time was 50 ms, and approximately 40,000 frames were recorded.

As the data were obtained with an sCMOS camera, which typically exhibit few pixels with deviating sensitivity (‘hot' and ‘cold' pixels), the obtained single-molecule data were corrected for individual pixels with abnormally high or low sensitivity first60. In total, 4,000 frames of a raw data stack were averaged. Hot and cold pixels, which are a systematic deviation, persist, in contrast to the random single-molecule signals. Each pixel was compared to its neighbors using 8-connectivity. If a deviation of more than 3% from the median of the neighboring pixel was observed, a correction factor that set the pixel to the median of its neighbors was recorded as previously described61. Otherwise, the pixel was not considered to be significantly brighter or darker. This yielded a correction mask, which was applied to all frames of the raw data. Finally, the no-light counts were subtracted from the pixel-corrected data.

For localization of single molecules, the Fiji plugin ThunderSTORM was used62. Each camera frame was filtered with a B-spline filter of order 3 and scale 2. Local maxima, corresponding to single-molecule signals, were detected with eight-neighborhood connectivity and a threshold of 1.1 or 1.2 times the standard deviation of the first wavelet level. Detected local maxima were fitted with a 2D Gaussian using least squares, and the position was recorded. Next, to account for single-molecule signals being active in multiple frames, merging of localizations was performed, using a maximum distance of 30 nm and a maximum of 5 off frames with no limit regarding on frames. Cross-correlation-based drift correction (magnification, 5; bin size, 5) was performed, followed by filtering of localizations (sigma of the point spread function between 60 and 270 nm, intensity below 37,800 photons, localization uncertainty smaller than 30 nm). For visualization, the final localizations were reconstructed as 2D histograms with a magnification of 5 (corresponding to a pixel size of 17.7 nm).

For cluster analysis, an automated pipeline was established using the raw list of localizations. First, Ripley's H function was calculated on three areas with a large number of well-separated clusters. The resulting preferential cluster size from the three areas (which was, notably, always very similar) was averaged, multiplied by a correction factor of 0.45 and used as the seed radius for the following DBSCAN analysis. This DBSCAN script yielded all individual clusters, the total number of clusters, the average number of points per cluster and the spatial relation between clusters. The identified final clusters were then analyzed with respect to their spatial relation, size and number of localizations. This unbiased approach follows recommended analysis procedures recently described63. Crucially, each dataset was subjected to identical postprocessing and cluster analysis steps with no manual intervention, thus avoiding any biases arising from different parameter settings. Custom scripts used for this analysis can be shared upon request.

Samples were prepared similarly to the flow cytometry workflow as described above. However, rather than dye-conjugated secondaries, here an HRP-conjugated secondary (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 31430) was used. The isotype (control) or anti-NPM1 (FC8791) (target) primary unconjugated antibody was precomplexed with an appropriate secondary HRP antibody at 2:1 (primary:secondary) for at least 30 min on ice. Cells were grown as biological triplicate cultures, and typically 2.5 million cells were used per replicate per labeling experiment. Cells were collected from culture, washed of culture medium and resuspended on ice-cold flow cytometry buffer to which the Fc blocker was added for at least 15 min. After blocking, cells were adjusted to 1 million cells per ml of flow cytometry buffer, and then the precomplexed antibodies were added for staining at a final concentration of 2.5 µg ml−1. Staining occurred for 60 min at 4 °C on rotation, after which cells were pelleted, supernatants were discarded and cells were washed once with ice-cold 1× PBS. This wash is important to remove excess BSA in the flow cytometry buffer. Next, cells were gently but quickly resuspended in 980 µl of 100 µM biotin-phenol (Iris Biotech) in 1× PBS at 25 °C. To this, 10 µl of 100 mM H2O2 (Sigma-Aldrich) was quickly added, tubes were capped and inverted, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 min at 25 °C. Precisely after 2 min, the samples were quenched by adding sodium azide and sodium ascorbate at a final concentration of 5 mM and 10 mM, respectively. Samples were inverted, and cells were pelleted at 4 °C. Samples were then washed sequentially once with ice-cold flow cytometry buffer and then twice with ice-cold 1× PBS, after which cell pellets were lysed in 500 µl CLIP lysis buffer, briefly sonicated to solubilize chromatin and frozen at −80 °C for later processing.

Once all the proximity labeling was complete, lysates were thawed in batches to perform the following steps in parallel. Total protein amounts were quantified using the BCA assay, and labeling efficiency and consistency were checked using western blotting. For biotin enrichment, we used the streptavidin western QC to determine the biotin signal across all samples first and then calculated the total µg of lysate that was needed from that sample to generate 5,000,000 units of streptavidin IR800 signal on the LI-COR system. This µg value was then used as the input mass for each of the replicates across all the proximity labeling samples for biotin capture and MS preparation. Samples were normalized to a final volume of 500 µl with CLIP lysis buffer, and, to each sample, 100 µl Pierce NeutrAvidin Agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added, and samples were incubated at 4 °C for 4 h on rotation. Beads were then washed twice with 1 ml of high-stringency buffer and twice with 1 ml of 4 M NaCl in 100 mM HEPES, all at 37 °C. Salts and detergents were then rinsed from the beads by sequentially washing twice with 1 ml 1× PBS, twice with 1 ml of LC–MS-grade water (Fisher Scientific) and finally with 1 ml of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. An on-bead trypsin digestion was then set up by adding 200 µl of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 1 µg MS-grade trypsin to each sample and incubating for 16 h at 37 °C with occasional shaking. After digestion, the samples were acidified by adding formic acid at a final concentration of 0.5%. The solution containing released peptides was moved to a new tube, and the beads were rinsed twice with 300 µl LC–MS-grade water to capture any remaining peptides. All elution and wash samples for a given replicate were combined and reduced to a volume of <200 µl with a SpeedVac. Samples were then desalted using a C18 spin column (Thermo Fisher Scientific): preconditioned with 50% methanol in water and washed twice with 5% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid in water, the sample was bound twice to the column, and then the columns were washed four times with 0.5% formic acid in water. Finally, peptides were eluted into Protein LoBind tubes (Eppendorf) with two applications of 40 µl of 70% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid in water. Organic solvents were removed with a SpeedVac, and samples were fully dried with a lyophilizer. Resulting peptides were analyzed on the timsTOF Pro as described above.

For all peptides generated, we followed the same procedure for MS analysis and peptide database searching. Specifically, a nanoElute was attached in line to a timsTOF Pro equipped with a CaptiveSpray Source (Bruker). Chromatography was conducted at 40 °C through a 25-cm reversed-phase C18 column (PepSep) at a constant flow rate of 0.5 µl min−1. Mobile phase A was 98% water, 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid (vol/vol/vol), and phase B was acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (vol/vol). During a 108-min method, peptides were separated by a three-step linear gradient (5% to 30% B over 90 min, 30% to 35% B over 10 min, 35% to 95% B over 4 min), followed by a 4-min isocratic flush at 95% for 4 min before washing and a return to low organic conditions. Experiments were run as data-dependent acquisitions with ion mobility activated in PASEF mode. MS and MS/MS spectra were collected with m/z 100 to 1,700, and ions with z = +1 were excluded. Raw data files were searched using PEAKS Online Xpro 1.7 (Bioinformatics Solutions). The precursor mass error tolerance and fragment mass error tolerance were set to 20 ppm and 0.03, respectively. The trypsin digest mode was set to semi-specific, and missed cleavages were set to 3. The human Swiss-Prot reviewed (canonical) database version 2020_05 (downloaded from UniProt) and the common Repository of Adventitious Proteins (cRAP version 1.0, downloaded from the Global Proteome Machine Organization) totaling 20,487 entries were used. Carbamidomethylation was selected as a fixed modification. Oxidation (M), deamidation (NQ) and acetylation (N terminus) were selected as variable modifications. Raw data files and searched datasets are available on the Mass Spectrometry Interactive Virtual Environment (MassIVE), a full member of the ProteomeXchange Consortium, under the identifier MSV000092211. The complete searched datasets are also available in Supplementary Information.

To identify enriched proteins from these datasets, we took an approach that compared enrichment in the NPM1 to that of isotype antibodies. Results of the database search were first purged of non-human proteins and keratins as previously described. All proteins with fewer than two unique peptides were also filtered out of the list. Next, Excel was used to calculate the mean spectral count for each of the remaining proteins across triplicates. For each protein, the mean spectral counts associated with each antibody probe were divided by the mean spectral counts of the corresponding isotype, creating an enrichment factor of each protein in the proximity labeling over the isotype. Python (version 3.13) was then used to calculate the ratio of total protein isolated from proximity labeling with protein-targeting antibodies divided by that collected with isotype antibodies. Proteins from each set of proximity labeling data with enrichments either less than two or the previously described ratio were filtered from the dataset. The resultant lists comprise the hits associated with each round of proximity labeling. To perform GO term analysis, all proteins observed across all four fractions from each cell line were concatenated, creating a list of background proteins from each of the four cell lines tested. Lists of hits from the membrane hit pulldowns from each cell line were submitted to DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) and run against their respective backgrounds. Next, for each category of GO term (BP, CC and MF), the union of the top four terms across all cell lines and their associated sizes and Benjamini values were plotted for comparison of enrichment across cell lines.

OCI-AML3 cells were collected, washed with flow cytometry buffer and resuspended at 106 cells per ml. They were then blocked with Human TruStain FcX for 15 min with 5 µl of Fc block per million cells. They were washed again afterward. The cells were then partitioned for live cell and fixed cell staining. Cells planned for fixation were stained with 1 µl of fixable violet LIVE/DEAD stain per 106 cells per ml for 30 min. Afterward, cells were washed with flow cytometry buffer and resuspended in 4% PFA for 10 min at room temperature. They were washed with flow cytometry buffer and then resuspended in 0.1% Triton X for 5 min at room temperature. Again, the cells were washed with flow cytometry buffer. Live cells and fixed cells were then incubated with 500 ng FC8791–Alexa Fluor 647 in 100 µl for 30 min. Cells were washed twice afterward, and live cells were finally resuspended in DAPI. For molecular counting, Quantum Alexa Fluor 647 molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome beads were used from Bangs Labs. All samples were analyzed on the BD LSRFortessa. Standard curves were generated and fluorescence quantitation was performed as per Bang Labs' QuickCal analysis tool.

Samples were prepared here in a similar manner as described above for the proximity labeling of proteins with key differences. The HRP-conjugated secondary antibody was exchanged for protein A–HRP (Cell Signaling) and used at the same molar ratio: two primary antibodies per one protein A–HRP molecule. The biotinylation reagent used here was biotin-aniline (Iris Biotech); it was used at a final concentration of 200 µM in 1× PBS for the labeling reaction, and the labeling reaction was allowed to proceed for 3 min at 25 °C. After pelleting the cells from the quenching reaction, cells were directly lysed, and total RNA was isolated as described before25. Briefly, RNAzol RT (Molecular Research Center) was used to lyse cell pellets by placing the samples at 50 °C and shaking for 5 min. To phase separate the RNA, 0.4× volumes of water was added, and samples were vortexed, allowed to stand for 5 min at 25 °C and lastly centrifuged at 12,000g at 4 °C for 15 min. The aqueous phase was transferred to clean tubes, and 1.1× volumes of isopropanol was added. The RNA was then purified over a Zymo column (Zymo Research). For all column cleanups, we used the following protocol. First, 350 μl of pure water was added to each column, samples were centrifuged at 10,000g for 30 s, and the flowthrough was discarded. Next, precipitated RNA from the RNAzol RT extraction (or binding buffer precipitated RNA, below) was added to the columns, which were centrifuged at 10,000g for 10–20 s, and the flowthrough was discarded. This step was repeated until all the precipitated RNA was passed over the column once. Next, the column was washed three times in total: once using 400 μl RNA Prep Buffer (3 M guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) in 80% ethanol) and twice with 400 μl 80% ethanol. The first two centrifugation steps were at 10,000g for 20 s, and the last one was for 30 s. RNA was then treated with proteinase K (Ambion) on the column. Proteinase K was diluted 1:19 in water and added directly to the column matrix and then allowed to incubate on the column at 37 °C for 45 min. The column top was sealed with either a cap or Parafilm to prevent evaporation. After the digestion, the columns were brought to room temperature for 5 min; lowering the temperature is important before proceeding. Next, eluted RNA was centrifuged out into fresh tubes, and a second elution with water was performed. The mucinase StcE (1.5 μg for every 50 μl of RNA, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the eluate, and samples were placed at 37 °C for 30 min to digest. The RNA was then cleaned up again using a Zymo column. Here, 2× RNA Binding Buffer (Zymo Research) was added, samples were vortexed for 10 s, and then 2× (samples + buffer) of 100% ethanol was added, and samples were vortexed for 10 s. The final RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop. In vitro RNase or sialidase digestions took place by digesting 50 μg total RNA with one of the following: nothing, 4 μl RNase Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or 4 μl of α2-3,6,8,9-neuraminidase A (NEB) in 1× NEB Glyco Buffer 1 (NEB) for 60 min at 37 °C. After digestion, RNA was purified using a Zymo column as noted above and was then ready for gel analysis.

To visualize the labeled RNA, it was run on a denaturing agarose gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and stained with streptavidin25. After elution from the column as described above, the RNA was combined with 12 μl of Gel Loading Buffer II (95% formamide (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 18 mM EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.025% SDS) with a final concentration of 1× SYBR Gold (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and denatured at 55 °C for 10 min. It is important to not use Gel Loading Buffer II with dyes. Immediately after this incubation, the RNA was placed on ice for at least 2 min. The samples were then loaded into a 1% agarose, 0.75% formaldehyde, 1.5× MOPS Buffer (Lonza) denaturing gel. Precise and consistent pouring of these gels is critical to ensure a similar thickness of the gel for accurate transfer conditions; we aim for solidified gels approximately 1 cm thick. RNA was electrophoresed in 1× MOPS at 115 V for between 34 and 45 min, depending on the length of the gel. Subsequently, the RNA was visualized with a UV gel imager, and excess gel was cut away; leaving ~0.75 cm of gel around the outer edges of sample lanes will improve transfer accuracy. The RNA was transferred with 3 M NaCl, pH 1 (with HCl) to a nitrocellulose membrane for 90 min at 25 °C. After transfer, the membrane was rinsed with 1× PBS and dried on Whatman paper (GE Healthcare). Dried membranes were rehydrated in Intercept Protein-Free Blocking Buffer, TBS (LI-COR Biosciences) for 30 min at 25 °C. After blocking, the membranes were stained using streptavidin IR800 (LI-COR Biosciences) diluted 1:5,000 in Intercept blocking buffer for 30 min at 25 °C. Excess streptavidin IR800 was washed from the membranes using three washes with 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma) in 1× PBS for 3 min each at 25 °C. The membranes were then briefly rinsed with PBS to remove the Tween-20 before scanning. Membranes were scanned on a LI-COR Odyssey CLx scanner (LI-COR Biosciences).

A research group at the University of Stuttgart has manipulated light through its interaction with a metal surface so that it exhibits entirely new properties. The researchers have published their findings in Nature Physics.

"Our results add another chapter to the emerging field of skyrmion research," proclaims Prof. Harald Giessen, head of the Fourth Physics Institute at the University of Stuttgart, whose group achieved this breakthrough. The team demonstrated the existence of "skyrmion bags" of light on the surface of a metal layer.

A better understanding of physical phenomena

Skyrmions are a mathematical description of vortex-like structures that help researchers better understand fundamental physical relationships. In recent years, this theoretical concept has been confirmed experimentally across a wide range of areas, including magnetic solids and material surfaces. Giessen's group has now investigated whether light impinging on the structured surface of a thin gold layer can be made to behave like skyrmion bags that follow specific symmetries. These bags consist of skyrmions contained within a larger skyrmion. For their experiment, the researchers etched fine grooves in the shape of two twisted hexagons into the gold surface with each hexagon generating a skyrmion light field.

Targeted manipulation of light fields

"We then observed a superposition of two skyrmion light fields, from which the skyrmion bags formed," explains Julian Schwab, lead author of the publication and doctoral student in Giessen's research group. Even more strikingly, the researchers were able to vary the number of skyrmions gathered within the skyrmion bags by adjusting the degree to which the light fields were twisted relative to one another. In other words, the researchers can manipulate light fields in a targeted manner, thereby giving them shapes that usually do not occur. For the experimental verification, Giessen's team collaborated with a research group at the University of Duisburg-Essen, and for the theoretical description of the phenomenon, with a group at the Technion in Haifa.

Fundamental research with application potential

So far, this is still fundamental physics. However, these light-field skyrmions exhibit extraordinary properties, thereby sparking researchers' imagination in terms of potential technical applications. Whether the gold surface used by Giessen's team is suitable for this purpose remains to be seen. "If someone finds a suitable material, our concept could be applied in microscopy," states Giessen. We could achieve resolutions with specialized microscopes that would otherwise be impossible because of the limits set by the wavelength of the light.

Scientists have identified a novel species of bacteria that acts as electrical wiring, potentially ushering in a new era of bioelectronic devices for use in medicine, industry, food safety, and environmental monitoring and cleanup.

The researchers who discovered the new cable bacteria species in a mud flat at the Oregon coast named it Ca. Electrothrix yaqonensis in honor of the Native Americans of the region where the species was found.

Findings were published today in Applied and Environmental Microbiology.

Cheng Li, a postdoctoral researcher at Oregon State University at the time of the research, and Clare Reimers, distinguished professor emerita in the OSU College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences, identified the new species in intertidal sediment samples from the Yaquina Bay estuary.

Cable bacteria consist of rod-shaped cells attached end to end with a shared outer membrane, forming filaments that can reach several centimeters in length. Their electrical conductivity, unusual among bacteria, is an adaptation that optimizes their metabolic processes in the sediment environments in which they live.

The new species features metabolic pathways and genes that are a mix of the Ca. Electrothrix genus and the other known cable bacteria genus, Ca. Electronema.

"This new species seems to be a bridge, an early branch within the Ca. Electrothrix clade, which suggests it could provide new insights into how these bacteria evolved and how they might function in different environments," said Li, who in June will return to Oregon State as an assistant professor in the College of Agricultural Sciences following a stint on the faculty of James Madison University.

"It stands out from all other described cable bacteria species in terms of its metabolic potential, and it has distinctive structural features, including pronounced surface ridges, up to three times wider than those seen in other species, that house highly conductive fibers made of unique, nickel-based molecules."

The fibers enable the bacteria to perform long-distance electron transport, connecting electron acceptors like oxygen or nitrate at the sediment surface with donors like sulfide in deeper sediment layers. The bacteria's ability to participate in reduction-oxidation reactions over significant distances gives it a key role in sediment geochemistry and nutrient cycling.

"These bacteria can transfer electrons to clean up pollutants, so they could be used to remove harmful substances from sediments," Li said. "Also, their design of a highly conductive nickel protein can possibly inspire new bioelectronics."

Cable bacteria can live under diverse climatic conditions and are found in various environments, including both freshwater and saltwater sediments.

Ca. Electrothrix yaqonensis draws its name from the Yaqona people, whose ancestral lands encompassed Yaquina Bay. Yaqona referred to the bay and river that made up much of their homeland, as well as to the people themselves.

Today, Yaqona descendants are part of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, with whom the researchers worked on coming up with a name for the new species.

"Naming an ecologically important bacterium after a Tribe recognizes its historical bond with the land and acknowledges its enduring contributions to ecological knowledge and sustainability," Li said.

Scientists from the University of Antwerp, Delft University of Technology and the University of Vienna also participated in the research, which was supported by the Office of Naval Research, Oregon Sea Grant, Research Foundation Flanders, the University of Antwerp, the EU Marie Sklodowska-Curie Cofund and the European Innovation Council.

When receiving a lung transplant, one of the most important complications to look out for is chronic lung allograft dysfunction, known as CLAD.

Preventing this complication for those who receive a lung transplant is of the highest priority, as there are no universally effective treatments for CLAD once it is established.

The most common of the immunosuppressing medications given to lung transplant recipients are calcineurin inhibitors.

Only two calcineurin inhibitors exist, cyclosporine and tacrolimus, and the available formulations are once-daily slow-release tacrolimus, twice-daily immediate-release tacrolimus and twice-daily cyclosporine.

While the medications have the same end goal, preventing rejection, whether they are equally effective is unknown.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction is a label for a wide range of clinical manifestations that all lead to the transplanted lung losing its normal function.

There can be some variation in how CLAD presents, as some patients have an obstructive ventilatory defect, some have a restrictive defect, and some have a mix of the two.

Regardless of the type, however, once chronic lung allograft dysfunction develops, lung function does not improve.

In the absence of effective treatments, strategies to prevent CLAD are crucial.

Using the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Thoracic Organ Transplant Registry data, a research team led by Michael Combs, M.D., M.S., an assistant professor of pulmonary diseases and internal medicine at Michigan Medicine, conducted the first study to show a survival benefit between using the treatments tacrolimus versus cyclosporine after lung transplantation.

Out of the 22,222 individuals with data for chronic lung allograft dysfunction treatment, 88.6% received tacrolimus immediate release.

The participants taking immediate release tacrolimus had a much lower rate of experiencing chronic lung allograft dysfunction than their counterparts that took twice-daily cyclosporine.

Combs wanted to highlight the positive finding for the twice-daily immediate release tacrolimus in this study.

"The Scan-CLAD study published earlier in the year found that tacrolimus once-daily extended-release had the best outcomes with regards to preventing the development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction, but the vast-majority of patients in actual practice are on twice-daily tacrolimus," said Combs.

"This present study should reassure transplant patients and providers twice-daily tacrolimus -- and not only once-daily tacrolimus -- is the superior treatment to cyclosporine."

"Importantly," Combs added, "in our study we found that twice-daily tacrolimus not only resulted in lower rates of CLAD relative to cyclosporine, but it was also associated with improved overall survival after lung transplantation. This is an important, patient-centered finding which has not been previously demonstrated."

"Given the theoretical benefits of once-daily medication regiments, future research will need to investigate if either tacrolimus XR and tacrolimus IR are superior to each other. However, until then, we can rest assured knowing that tacrolimus -- regardless of its formulation -- is the best option for our lung transplant patients," he stated.

ODMs are more reluctant to make the move.

Lenovo, HP, and Dell, the world's three largest PC vendors, are reportedly exploring expansion options in Saudi Arabia. According to Digitimes, Saudi Arabia is actively recruiting tech manufacturers with facilities in China to relocate to the Arabian Peninsula as fears of tariff insecurities heighten. The three tech giants are all in different stages of starting production facilities in or near Saudi Arabia's capital city, Riyadh. Lenovo has already declared its plans to build a PC and server assembly factory in Riyadh, and is backed by a $2 billion investment from a subsidiary of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF). HP and Dell have now reportedly sent teams to conduct visits to the country and scout potential construction sites after requests from local governments. Saudi Arabia has also invited several ODMs to move their production facilities to the Arabian Peninsula. Foxconn, Quanta Wistron, Compal, and Inventec are reportedly among the top names being courted, but the ODMs are reticent to move to the Middle East. The ODMs claim that the potential for development in Saudi Arabia hinges on client willingness and outside logistical factors.Saudi Arabia is offering some big promises to potential business partners, and many of these promises are highly attractive to OEMs — but less convincing to ODMs. Beyond the obvious benefit of only being subject to 10% reciprocal tariffs into the U.S. from Saudi Arabia — as opposed to the 245% tariffs currently aimed at China — OEMs are also being courted with the full might of Saudi Arabia's PIF, a $620 billion fund to attract business into the nation. Saudi Arabia has reportedly made assurances, including preferred access to local and African government contracts and start-up perks like fully paid-for factory construction, to Lenovo, HP, and Dell. The potential in-roads into the African market beyond Saudi Arabia were credited as a large part of Lenovo's decision to take its $2 billion Riyadh deal."Through this powerful strategic collaboration and investment, Lenovo will have significant resources and financial flexibility to further accelerate our transformation and grow our business by capitalizing on the incredible growth momentum in KSA [Kingdom of Saudi Arabia] and the wider MEA [Middle East and Africa] region," said Yuanqing Yang, CEO of Lenovo. Lenovo's plant is planned to be fully operational in 2026, at which point Lenovo will begin producing a direct-to-Saudi-Arabia line of products. While this promise of expansion into the greater African and Middle Eastern market is highly attractive to vendors like Lenovo, the ODMs who design their add-in boards are less keen. ODMs require existing supply chain and logistics conditions beyond just labor and production facilities to successfully produce innovative designs — and though Saudi Arabia's goals are high, they do not currently stand out against most ODMs' current operational partners. Vietnam and Thailand are the main production hubs for ODMs such as Foxconn outside of China, thanks to tested supply chain connections. Many ODMs also already have production and R&D facilities in Mexico to take advantage of USMCA free-trade agreements and allow them to skirt U.S. tariffs. ODMs already have proven clients in the OEMs, whereas the OEMs are more likely to be concerned with expanding their market reach. This large-scale courting of the computing industry into Saudi Arabia is part of KSA's "Vision 2030" economic plan, which is built on a goal of moving Saudi Arabia's economy beyond fossil fuels and into a more diverse, modern trade giant. Constant tariff flip-flops coming from the U.S. government are certainly helping Saudi Arabia meet this goal, as the world's supply chains are reeling from the newfound instability coming from the world's economic center and are looking for new homes to maintain their security.

Amid rumors that the company is eyeing an IPO, Discord appointed former Activision Blizzard Vice Chairman Humam Sakhnini as CEO. Discord co-founder Jason Citron will leave his CEO role after 13 years at the company.

Discord straddles the gaming and social media spaces — despite its initial emergence as a platform for online multiplayer gamers to communicate, it has become a prominent social media platform in its own right, growing to over 200 million monthly active users.

The company's choice to appoint a new CEO from within the gaming industry signals that it sees its future more so in gaming than in social networking. Discord noted in its press release that the company has “refocused on its gaming roots” to explore monetization opportunities in advertising and micro-transactions.

But advertising and micro-transactions aren't exactly music to gamers' ears. The appointment of Sakhnini, along with its impending IPO, may make fans wary that the company may move in a more corporate, profit-hungry direction. Sakhnini was also CEO of the Activision Blizzard-owned King, a mobile gaming developer that makes games like Candy Crush, which thrive on ads and micro-transactions.

Citron will remain involved with Discord as an advisor to the CEO and a member of the board of directors.

Citron looks forward to taking a break after 13 years of running a rapidly-growing startup. He told Venture Beat that he wants to play Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Blue Prince, and Baldur's Gate III.

They've been stockpiling for almost a full year.

China's top three internet companies reportedly stockpiled billions of dollars worth of Nvidia H20 GPUs before the U.S. export restrictions went into effect in April. Nikkei Asia reports that ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent anticipated the likelihood of an export ban on the China-specific H20 last year, and have since been snapping up as many H20 GPUs as they can get their hands on.The three companies have reportedly accumulated around 1 million H20s — or about a full year's supply. While that is a significant number of GPUs, the companies' full supply was cut short by a month, as they requested that Nvidia ship them their fully-requested volume of H20s by the end of May. If all three companies managed to get their hands on all the H20s they requested, the total value would exceed $12 billion.High demand for computing power is apparently the main reason for the companies' stockpiling: Tencent's integration of DeepSeek into WeChat is a huge contributor to China's demand for computing power.The Nvidia H20 will serve as a stop-gap solution for Chinese companies until homegrown AI GPUs are able to provide similar — or better — performance. Huawei is reportedly working on a new Ascend GPU claimed to rival the performance of Nvidia's GB200, which would give China the same AI computing capabilities as Western countries. Starting in April, the U.S government banned the exportation of Nvidia's H20 HGX AI GPU designed for the Chinese market. The government cited the GPU's memory and interconnect bandwidth, as well as its potential use in supercomputers, as reasons for the ban. The new restriction will force Nvidia to take a massive $5.5 billion financial hit, as it can no longer sell its existing inventory of H20 GPUs to China.The H20 is a cut-down variant of the H100 — Nvidia's predecessor to the current HGX B200. Similar to the RTX 5090D and RTX 4090D, the H20 is a datacenter GPU tailor-made to comply with the U.S government's export sanctions to China, featuring dramatically reduced AI and HPC performance compared to its bigger brother.

“At what time exactly can you preorder the Nintendo Switch 2?” For eager gamers, that's the very big question as June 5, 2025 (release date) gets closer. The general Switch 2 preorder window is officially opening at a very specific time: midnight Eastern Time on April 24, 2025. So at 12:00 a.m. ET, or 9:00 p.m. Pacific Time on April 23, preorders for the Nintendo console will be available to fans all over the United States online.

Walmart is one of the best retailers to preorder the Switch 2 from. Like Target and Best Buy, Walmart's online pre-orders begin precisely at midnight ET on April 24. What sets Walmart apart is its promotion of free (and guaranteed) delivery by 9 a.m. local time on release day, June 5, for orders placed by June 4 at 8 a.m. ET, while supplies hold out. This early delivery promise on launch day is a special advantage that can be a lifesaver if you're eager to start playing as soon as possible.

Two general buying options have been provided by Nintendo for the Switch 2: The standard console is priced at $449.99 and a bundle of the console and the new Mario Kart World game is available for $499.99. Since Mario Kart World alone retails for $79.99, the bundle is a great value if you want to get into the new racing game immediately.

What's the difference between this new 2025 model and the previous version of the console? The portable display has increased to 7.9 inches at full 1080p resolution which is a big jump from the original's 6.2-inch 720p screen. If you like to play on your TV, you will find that the new console offers 4K output for visuals that were not possible on the original Switch. The refresh rate is doubled (to 120Hz) when in handheld mode, and you'll get HDR support.

Beyond the screen, the Switch 2 also features a new kickstand design that is wider and adjustable at various angles for improved comfort. The Joy-Con controllers now magnetically clip on and connect via pins for simpler setup. Audio improvements include integrated speakers with 3D audio and a new Chat button that activates a built-in noise-cancelling microphone. Storage has also been increased to 256GB (from the original 32GB) and it supports faster microSD Express cards.

What's for sure is that securing a Switch 2 preorder requires moving quickly: demand will probably outpace supply. Stock will likely be gone quickly, and tariffs or import fees can cause prices to increase at any time. Preordering the Switch 2 via an established retailer like Walmart that guarantees release-day shipping is the best option to make sure you receive your console for the listed price.

When I get behind the wheel, I have my little routine I always do. I queue up a playlist or podcast on Spotify, then I plug in the address I'm headed to in Google Maps. It doesn't matter if it's somewhere I've been a million times. I like to just see the traffic and ETA regardless. Offload the mental effort of navigating so I both focus on the road itself while letting my mind wander. Though streaming music and GPS is a great way to kill your phone battery. That's why I right after clicking my phone into its AC mount, I also plug it into a car charger. This Anker USB-C car charger is perfect for the job and right now it's part of a limited time deal—chopping 20% off the price. It can be yours for just $14.

See at Amazon

The Anker car charger is universally compatible. Doesn't matter if you have an iPhone, a Samsung Galaxy, or a Google Pixel. With USB-C, you can connect to any modern smartphone to ensure you don't run out of battery. It has 40W dual ports so you can have two devices plugged in charging at the same time (20W per port). This is great news for whoever is riding shotgun. It's also compatible with just about any vehicle which has a car port.

The charger is super fast. When compared to an original 5W charger, you can charge an iPhone 15 Pro from nothing back up to 25% approximately three times faster. The LED indicator let's you know you device is charging. Additionally, the ports themselves are lit up when the car port in connected so you can easily find them when driving in the dark of night.

Bumpy roads are no match for the Anker car charger. It uses side spring buttons which keep the charger firmly in place to ensure stable charging even when your vehicle is going over rough terrain or hits a pot hole in the road.

Anker's car charger is compact in design. It really just the nub and two ports. Makes it easy to pack with you when traveling. Great to stick in your bag if you're ever out of state, renting a car and unsure what kind of charging you'll have before being handed your keys.

For a limited time, you can secure yourself one of these twin port Anker car chargers for a heft 20% off. It's not that expensive to begin with so you're only saving a few bucks. Though that's not really a complaint. Just an observation of how affordable it was before and how even more affordable it is now. Get one for just $14.

But Polymaker announces prices will increase starting May 1st.

While the cost of your next 3D printer may be going up in the U.S., the cost of your filament doesn't have to increase. Or that is, it won't if you buy American. Many customers in the U.S. are bemoaning the impact of President Trump's tariff war on their favorite hobby, with new 3D printers possibly going up hundreds of dollars or remaining mysteriously out of stock.

Polymaker, a global supplier of affordable filament, recently announced that it will be forced to increase prices by 10% on May 1st. In a statement issued on its website, Polymaker said it reviewed the amount of stock sitting in U.S. warehouses before making the difficult decision to hike prices to compensate for tariffs.

I had the chance to talk to Polymaker representatives at Rapid + TCT in Detroit earlier this month and ask them if the new Houston, TX plant would help keep costs down. The answer was yes and no. Unfortunately for the average consumer, the Texas facility specializes in wholesale customers and only produces PLA, PETG, ABS, and ASA in limited colors. You also have to buy over $1,000 in materials to place a wholesale order. But if that's you, congratulations, your prices are holding steady.



Many American filament manufacturers are able to keep their supply chain domestic thanks to NatureWorks, a U.S. plastics company that creates raw PLA pellets from Nebraska-grown corn.

American filament companies are taking advantage of the tariff talks to remind customers that they can always buy local. Polar Filament in Troy, MI announced on social media that pricing would remain the same, as its entire supply chain is US-based.

“So far, we've confirmed that the most critical components, including the resin (the raw plastic pellets), colorants, spools, and even the paper used in our boxes, are all sourced domestically. We're also setting up our own injection molding machine so we can make spools right here at our facility,” said Mitch Davis in the statement.

Polar Filament currently sets its price for Basic PLA at $18.99 and $21.99 for premium colors, besting Polymaker's price by several dollars. Free shipping for US customers kicks in after three spools.

I also stopped to chat with New York-based GreenGate manufacturer Rich Silberfeld during Rapid + TCT in Detroit. GreenGate makes premium recycled PETG filament that can easily print at lower PLA temperatures. Silberfeld said his filament not only saves plastic scraps from going into the landfill, but also uses domestic colorants and spools. He was showcasing a special color, Spartan Armor Green, in honor of Michigan State University while stationed in the America Makes section of Rapid + TCT.

GreenGate is running a sale on the American Bundle, a three-pack of Red, White, and Blue PETG, which also includes free shipping and a t-shirt, for just $86.37.



Here are a few more of our favorite tried and tested, Made in the USA filaments that use domestic NatureWorks raw materials.

Noise-cancellation is a great addition on any premium pair of headphones or earbuds, but what it does is drive up the price way high. It's not something that's always needed. If you're not frequently riding on airplanes or trying to drown out the sounds of a couple arguing in the apartment next door, you'll probably be find just listening on the standard mode. So, you'd only be paying the standard price, not premium. Well, Soundcore has a solid pair of wireless earbuds that get the job done and are crazy affordable. Normally they go for $40 which is already pretty reasonable. But for a limited time, you can secure yourself a pair for 50% off. That's right. At the time of writing this, the Soundcore by Anker P20i true wireless earbuds are just $20.

See at Amazon

Available in a variety of fun colors including black, white, blue, light blue, and pink, these wireless earbuds feature 10mm drivers with big bass sound. You can still get lost in your music without the fancy noise cancelation of expensive headphones.

These Soundcore earbuds let you customize their sound to your preferences. Within the Soundcore app, you can choose between 22 EQ preset modes. The app also has its own “Find My Earbuds” feature the way Apple does for all its products.  They'll even emit a sound on demand to help you locate them. That comes in handy when you don't remember what bag you place them in and don't know if you left that at home or in the office.

You can listen to your favorite music and podcasts through the entire work day as these Soundcore earbuds can get up to 10 hours of battery life on a single charge. That time is extended further with the charging case which can boost that up to 30 hours. Find yourself in a pinch where neither the buds nor case are charger? No worries. A quick 10-minute charge will bring you back up to two full hours of listening time. The charging case also comes with a nifty lanyard attached to make it easy to clip onto your keys or a bag.

These earbuds can be used to take phone calls thanks to their two built-in mics. They use an algorithm to identify your voice over background noises to ensure folks on the other end never have to hear your shout. You'll come through crystal clear.

For a limited time, you can pick up a pair of Soundcore by Anker P20i true wireless earbuds for their all-time low price of just $20.

China wants to ensure that the materials it sells won't come back to bite it.

Tesla's humanoid robot Optimus, which it says is designed for taking over household chores, has recently hit a production snag, which Elon Musk calls a “magnet issue.” In early April, China blocked the export of seven rare earth metals in response to President Trump's application of 54% tariffs on Chinese goods. Aside from being used in global chipmaking supply chains, these materials are also applied in several high-tech industries, including lasers, radar, jet engines, and more.

“We're working through that with China. Hopefully, we'll get a license to use the rare-earth magnets,” Elon Musk said. “China wants some assurances that these are not used for military purposes, which obviously they're not. They're just going into a humanoid robot.”

However, even if this robot is designed as a substitute for a household employee, its inherent humanoid design makes it useful for other tasks, including those that China might deem “military applications”. Aside from that, Musk's other companies, like SpaceX, have active contracts with the U.S. military. Musk is closely allied with the U.S. president and works with him directly through DOGE or the Department of Government Efficiency. This might make Beijing balk at giving any entity related to him any license for these crucial materials.

Some companies are looking for alternatives to Chinese sources for these rare earth metals, especially as China has claimed state ownership of all this material within its borders. However, they'd have difficulty looking for a replacement that can deliver at the exact cost and quality because of how much the East Asian country has invested in mining them. China produced about 70% of all the rare earth elements in the market in 2023, with 94% of the global gallium supply, crucial for power chips, coming from within its borders.

Many exporters have already expected delays because of China's new requirements. However, Tesla is one of the first companies to publicly state the impact of China's export bans on its plans and production. He also said that Trump's tariffs have greatly impacted Tesla's energy business, primarily as it imports its battery cells from the country.

“The impact of tariffs on the energy business will be outsized since we source LFP (lithium iron phosphate) battery cells from China,” Musk said during the earnings call. “We're in the process of commissioning equipment for the local manufacturing of LFP battery cells in the US.”

The Nintendo Switch 2 is now available to pre-order starting tonight with the official release date as June 5, 2025. Walmart is beginning pre-orders of the Switch 2 precisely at midnight Eastern Time on April 24, 2025 (which is 9:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the 23rd).

Nintendo fans have two choices to choose from now: the Switch 2 console for $449.99 on its own, or the Mario Kart World bundle that includes the console and the eagerly awaited new Mario Kart game for $499.99. This is a great deal since Mario Kart World by itself can be bought for $79.99, so this is a great purchase for fans wanting to dive right into the new racing adventure from the start. Make sure you pre-order your Switch 2 asap as it can run out of stock pretty quickly.

One of the most popular retailers to put your Nintendo Switch 2 preorder is Walmart: Walmart surpasses many other retailers by ensuring delivery by 9 a.m. local time on release date, June 5, for customers who preorder by June 4 at 8 a.m. ET (while supplies last). The guarantee of on-time delivery is a major advantage, especially with the expected high demand and short supply. Remember, Nintendo just postponed the pre-order phase in the U.S. by a few weeks, and the stock is still pretty short.

So, why should you buy the latest Nintendo console? The Switch 2 hype is well-deserved given its stunning upgrade over the original Switch and the most impressive feature is a larger 7.9-inch LCD touchscreen with a 1080p full resolution in handheld mode (which is a gigantic improvement over the 6.2-inch 720p screen of the original). For those who like to play on the TV, the Switch 2 can output at 4K resolution for some games and offers beautifully rendered pictures the older system could not deliver. The refresh rate has also been doubled to 120Hz in handheld mode to allow for smoother gameplay especially for fast-paced genres like fighting and shooters. HDR support brings even more color vibrancy and lighting effects to the gaming experience.

Other than simply the screen, the Switch 2 available for pre-order has a new and wider kickstand that spans almost the whole back of the console and offers multiple adjustable angles. The new Joy-Con controllers snap on and off magnetically and connect via pins which makes the setup easier and their durability better. Sound also got a boost with built-in speakers that support 3D audio while a new Chat button offers voice chat using a built-in noise-cancelling microphone. Storage has been also increased massively to 256GB from the original Switch's 32GB and the console supports faster microSD Express cards.

The gaming community is eager for the hardware but also for the launch games of the Switch 2. Mario Kart World promises expansive race courses with changing weather and improved water effects and other nostalgic franchises like Donkey Kong and Kirby are back with optimized-for-the-new-console games as well. Worth pointing out is the fact that Switch 2 remains compatible with the majority of today's Switch titles.

If you're looking to pre-order the Switch 2, you must act quickly. Nintendo is trying to close down scalping and outrageous resale price markups but demand will greatly exceed supply. There will be stock shortages and with tariffs and import fees unpredictable, prices could skyrocket. Putting in a preorder today on the Nintendo console, especially with a good retailer like Walmart that guarantees on-launch delivery, is the best way to ensure that you'll be able to get your hands on the new console asap.

Companies are letting go of their idle GPUs for instant profits.

Some AI data centers in China are reportedly holding large stocks of China-specific 48GB Nvidia RTX 4090D GPUs, dismantling and refurbishing them, and then reselling them on the market as new cards. DigiTimes Asia reports that a few companies are resorting to letting go of excess computing capacity to generate multiple times the profit compared to renting the GPUs out, which will take them about three to five years to recoup their investment.

This move is a sign of how China's AI rush is leading to billions of dollars in idle infrastructure. The report states that an AI data center requires a utilization rate of more than 70% to 75% for it to turn a profit. However, activation rates remain below 20%, meaning a significant amount of capacity is left unused and many GPUs remain idle. To help them stay afloat, a few companies are turning to selling their unused assets to generate some quick cash and pay off the bank loans they used to purchase their hardware.

Selling RTX 4090 cards is quite lucrative, too. Currently, these China-specific RTX 4090D GPUs with 48GB of VRAM are priced between CNY20,000 and CNY40,000, or approximately US$2,735 and US$5,470. We're unsure if these cards were used at all, but they still need to be modified if the data center wants to sell them to consumers. Data centers typically convert fan-cooled GPUs into blower-style cards, such as this blower-style RTX 5090D leaked on Bilibili, for improved efficiency when used in multi-GPU systems. However, these are much noisier and provide less cooling when used as a single unit.

One surprising aspect is that AI data centers are doing this despite the uncertainty surrounding AI chip supply from the U.S. The White House has recently blocked China-compliant Nvidia H20 and AMD MI308 chips for export to China, and there are also some rumors that the 5090D might also be affected by the ban. In fact, it's rumored that Nvidia has mentioned suspending supplying 5090D chips to its board partners, although it did not mention stopping sales entirely.

Despite this, companies are still letting go of excess capacity — likely because they need to cover their financial costs, or they risk going under. Furthermore, as chip technologies advance, companies that use older-generation AI GPUs will no longer be competitive, and they will be forced to sell these cards anyway. Therefore, it probably makes sense for them to release these underutilized assets now and then purchase whatever is available when demand actually arises.

Nvidia Blackwell AI datacenters get cooling upgrade


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Modern cloud data centers not only consume an immense amount of power for computing and cooling, but also a significant amount of water, as most use evaporative liquid cooling.

By contrast, Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 and GB300 NVL72 machines utilize direct-to-chip liquid cooling systems, which are claimed to be 25 times more energy-efficient and 300 times more water-efficient than today's coolers. However, there is a catch, as NVL72 rack-scale systems consume over seven times more power than typical racks.

Typical data center server racks consume around 20kW of power, whereas Nvidia's H100-based racks consume over 40kW of power. However, Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 and GB300 NVL72 rack-scale systems consume 120kW – 140kW of power, outpacing the vast majority of racks already installed.

As a result, air-based cooling methods are no longer sufficient to manage the thermal loads produced by these high-density racks. Therefore, Nvidia had to adopt a new cooling solution for its Blackwell machines, which led to the development of a new solution.

Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 and GB300 NVL72 systems use direct-to-chip liquid cooling. This approach involves circulating coolant directly through cold plates attached to GPUs, CPUs, and other heat-generating components, efficiently transferring heat away from these devices without relying on air as the intermediary.

Unlike evaporative cooling or immersion cooling, NVL72's liquid cooling is a closed-loop system, so coolant does not evaporate or require replacement due to loss from phase change, saving water.

In the NVL72 architecture, the heat absorbed by the liquid coolant is then transferred to the data center's cooling infrastructure through rack-level liquid-to-liquid heat exchangers. These coolant distribution units (CDUs), such as the CoolIT CHx2000, are capable of managing up to 2 mW of cooling capacity, supporting high-density deployments with low thermal resistance and reliable heat rejection.

Additionally, this setup enables the systems to operate with warm water cooling, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for mechanical chillers, which improves both energy efficiency and water conservation.

There are several things to note about Nvidia's closed-loop direct-to-chip liquid cooling solutions. Although closed-loop liquid cooling solutions are widely used by PC enthusiasts, there are several practical, engineering, and economic reasons why these systems are presently not widely adopted at scale.

Data centers require modularity and accessibility for maintenance, upgrades, and component replacement, which is why they use hot-swappable components. However, hermetically sealed systems make the quick replacement of failed servers or GPUs difficult, as breaking the seal would compromise the entire cluster.

Also, routing sealed liquid loops across racks and the entire data center introduces logistical complexity in piping, pump redundancy, and failure isolation. Fortunately, current direct-to-chip liquid cooling solutions use quick-disconnect fittings with dripless seals, which offer serviceability without full hermetic sealing (at the end of the day, detecting and isolating leaks quickly is cheaper than creating a fully hermetic data center-scale solution). However, using data center-scale liquid cooling still requires redesign of the whole data center, which is expensive.

Nonetheless, since Nvidia's Blackwell processors offer unbeatable performance, adopters of B200 GPUs are willing to invest in such redesigns. Additionally, it is worth noting that Nvidia has co-developed reference designs with Schneider Electric for 1152 GPU DGX SuperPOD GB200 clusters, utilizing Motivair liquid-to-liquid CDUs and fluid coolers with adiabatic assist. This enables the quick deployment of such systems with maximized efficiency.

Although Nvidia mandates the use of liquid cooling with its Blackwell B200 GPUs and systems, the company has invested in reference designs of sealed liquid cooling solutions to avoid the use of evaporative liquid cooling solutions, in an effort to preserve water, which seems to be a reasonable tradeoff.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Last week, researchers using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) announced they had found something intriguing on a distant exoplanet called K2-18 b: a potential whiff of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), a molecule that, on Earth, is produced almost exclusively by microscopic marine life. The exoplanet, located about 120 light-years away, orbits within the habitable zone of a red dwarf star and may be a Hycean world: a steamy, ocean-covered planet with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.

While the detection came with a statistical confidence of 3-sigma (very promising, but not definitive), headlines around the world buzzed with speculation about the first detection of life beyond Earth. But not everyone's convinced. Scientists across disciplines are now weighing in—some are cautiously optimistic about the latest research, while others are deeply skeptical. Could DMS be a sign of life, or is it just weird, abiotic chemistry happening under extreme conditions?

For this latest Giz Asks, we've rounded up expert reactions to the findings, digging into the chemistry, the data's limitations, and what it'll take to move the needle from “maybe” to something more conclusive. Because in astrobiology, the line between interesting and extraordinary is razor thin. The following responses were lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

A planetary chemist at the University of Cambridge who studies the potential habitability of planets, among other things.

I have worked on developing an understanding of the climate and structure (i.e., the size and temperature of the atmosphere, what underlies the atmosphere etc.) of K2-18 b.

I do not believe the report of DMS in the spectrum of K2-18 b moves the astrobiological needle. The series of steps to having confidence we have seen signs of life beyond Earth are roughly:

The K2-18 b detection has not passed 1 or 2 yet—for that the community needs to confirm for themselves there is a signal. This is not my expertise.

3 and 4 are closer to my expertise. Here, K2-18 b presents a particular challenge to life. There is presently no requirement from the data that this planet hosts liquid water oceans and a climate amenable to life. In fact, based on the data there is every reason to believe the climate will be far too hot for liquid water oceans, with the deep atmosphere potentially being underlain by oceans of magma, not liquid water. For this reason, even if 1 and 2 return a DMS detection, our expectation should be that this [molecule] has emerged in a lifeless, hot, sulfur and hydrogen rich atmosphere and ask ourselves what the atmospheric chemistry is that would have enabled this. Believing instead that this is DMS of biological origin would require overturning our every expectation as to the climate of this planet, without any other reason to do this from the data.

In other words, we are a long way from believing K2-18 b can be inhabited, let alone is inhabited.

A geochemist at the Southwest Research Institute and an expert in researching the possibility of extraterrestrial life on ocean worlds.

This is a very interesting new dataset. It appears that there are unexplained features in the spectrum of K2-18 b, which could be attributed to dimethyl sulfide or dimethyl disulfide. However, these results are stretching JWST to its limits (K2-18 b is a fairly small planet), and it's possible that further analysis may find a lack of statistically significant evidence for these features. We need more astronomers on this case as soon as possible! Currently, I'm intrigued but cautious about the potential presence of these molecules on K2-18 b.

Even if DMS or DMDS are present, we must be very careful in treating them as biosignatures. We've only just begun to ask questions about the abiotic background on this kind of planet. Exotic chemistry might surprise us, as planets are more complex (and wonderfully interesting) than we first assume. For life to be detected, multiple supporting pieces of evidence must be found, and this will take time. Let's digest these new results and get to work.

My preprint includes an important finding quoted below:

“Because a revised deep-atmosphere scenario can accommodate depleted CO [carbon monoxide] and NH3 [ammonia] abundances, the apparent absence of these species should no longer be taken as evidence against this type of scenario for TOI-270 d [a planet orbiting another red dwarf, discovered in 2019] and similar planets, such as K2-18 b. Our results imply that the Hycean hypothesis is currently unnecessary to explain any data, although this does not preclude the existence of Hycean worlds.”

The whole thing is completely blown out of proportions. Sorry that I am a bit short in my answers, but I have had to deal with this in the Dutch and Belgium media for the last two days, and I am a little done.

The research team finds bumps in their spectrum. It is not clear whether these are real, and if so, what they could be caused by. There could be dozens of molecules (if real), or even cloud features. What do the authors do? They just look whether DMS could cause this (and add DMDS). They ignore the dozens of other species [i.e. non-biological sources of molecules] that could cause this bump and call it a day. If I had been the referee, I would have stopped this publication right there. There is no reason to invoke astrobiology, let alone call it the biggest breakthrough or whatever.

Most reporters are writing a piece where they say something like “however, not all scientists are as convinced…” I can tell you, it is much worse than that, but most of us are keeping our mouths shut. I understand why, in these difficult times, but in the long run this will hurt astronomy when nobody will take us seriously anymore. You can quote me on that.

A planetary scientist at MIT specializing in extrasolar planet atmospheres.

Because they likely can't ever be confirmed either way, we have to live with what we might call “biosignature planet candidates.” This planet needs more work to get there. You can be sure that others are working on ways DMS can be produced without life.

I appreciate people's enthusiasm. With more evidence, this and other planets might be “blessed” as biosignature candidates, but will remain in the candidate category indefinitely.

Since the arrival of nuclear power in the 1950s, more than 400 reactors in 31 countries have produced about 430,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel, and until now no one has developed a permanent solution for disposing of it. The International Atomic Energy Agency estimates that about 30 percent of this fuel has been reprocessed—elements in spent fuel can be recycled to create new fuel for nuclear plants—but the rest has been “parked” in temporary storage systems, with its final destination yet to be determined.

And with the nuclear sector showing signs of undergoing a renaissance—as countries look to decarbonize energy production and with the tech sector seeking ways to power its electricity-hungry AI systems—the pressure for nuclear-waste disposal is likely to grow.

The best solution would be to put spent fuel in an underground facility that can contain it safely for millennia. Spent fuel is a major threat to human health for at least 10,000 years and remains radioactive for several million. But such facilities have to be built from scratch, and while several are being developed, none have been completed. The leader in this race is Finland, which has dug the underground space needed for a repository.

On the country's west coast, roughly three hours' drive from the capital, Helsinki, is what will become the country's first encapsulation plant. Known as Onkalo, it will receive spent fuel from Finland's five nuclear reactors—three on the nearby island of Olkiluoto and two in Loviisa, in the southeast of the country. The repository is being built by Posiva Oy, a Finnish company set up by two of the country's nuclear operators in 1995 to find a way of permanently storing spent nuclear fuel.

In the bedrock here, at a depth of 430 meters, testing is underway. Storage of spent fuel involves placing spent fuel rods inside copper canisters, which in turn have to be inserted into slots dug into the granite walls of the subterranean repository. Everything is then sealed with bentonite, a soft, plastic clay that insulates the containers and acts as a buffer against minor movements in the bedrock.

In mid-March, five test containers, filled with nonradioactive materials, were sealed in a special aboveground facility before being transported underground and stored along a 70-meter-long subterranean tunnel, to provide an initial proof of concept for Onkalo's storage process. The completion of this dummy run puts Finland in the lead in the race to build the world's first operational deep geological repository.

Onkalo's construction has so far cost €900 million, while an estimated €4 billion more is needed to complete the project. Breaking ground here followed decades of research to find the best location for the repository and years waiting for permits and approvals. There are some who still don't believe the project will happen and others who hope it won't. Some locals have been hostile to the project, unhappy with the prospect of nuclear waste being stored nearby and perplexed at how easily, in their opinion, Posiva Oy was able to get permits for the repository. Researchers have also expressed concerns about potential corrosion of storage containers, specifically the copper canisters.

Together with his colleagues, Jinshan Pan, a professor of corrosion science at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, published a study in January 2023 devoted to the risk of sulfides in groundwater corroding the copper used for spent nuclear fuel containers. “More work is needed to define […] the nature and chemistry of the surface films that develop on copper surfaces in repository conditions,” the paper says.

While Posiva Oy looks like it may have the first functioning repository, other countries are following its lead. Neighbouring Sweden is also preparing to start work on its own repository, which is intended to contain up to 12,000 metric tons of Swedish spent nuclear fuel. It is expected to extend over 60 kilometers of tunnel once it is finished, at a depth of 500 meters. It is a major work that has been on the drawing table for 40 years and obtained its necessary environmental permits for construction only a few months ago. Construction could start within the next decade and would continue until the 2080s, with this repository's underground space gradually extending—provided an appeal made by the Office for Nuclear Waste Review, a Swedish NGO, does not slow or halt the work. Concerns about the Swedish project are the same as with the Finnish one: danger of corrosion of the copper canisters, possibly resulting in the release of radioactive elements into the groundwater.

On the other side of the Atlantic, Canada is also planning to build a storage facility. The repository doesn't exist yet, but the path forward appears relatively free of obstacles—at least there are no apparent legal ones. After 14 years of dialog and debates, the relevant bodies and citizens have selected a host site within the Township of Ignace, Ontario, part of the indigenous community the Wabigoon Lake Ojibway Nation. Both the town and nation were open to the project, seeing it as a source of investments and new jobs.

France and Switzerland are also working on projects, gradually making progress, even if much of it is a matter of getting over bureaucratic hurdles. In the Meuse region of northeastern France, field work on the Cigéo project could begin in 2027 now that it has received a positive assessment of its soundness. The implementing company Andra has been authorized to continue with plans, providing it gives greater consideration to the potential impact of climate change on the aboveground structures.

It has taken Switzerland's national radioactive-waste-disposal cooperative, Nagra, 14 years to decide where to locate its storage facility. It has chosen to build its repository north of Zurich, in Nördlich Lägern, because it is an area particularly rich in very compact opaline clay, which is perfect for acting as a long-term container for radioactive materials. (Finland's site is also rich in this material.) Final approval is expected around 2030, subject to a referendum, and the repository should start to operate by 2060.

Finally, Italy is considering 51 sites that could potentially be suitable to host a repository for nuclear waste storage. These plans were first drawn up in 2015 and then published in December 2023. The government has since decided to reopen the application process to accommodate new applications. In the meantime, radioactive waste in the country remains stored in temporary repositories at the sites of decommissioned nuclear power plants, nuclear research facilities, and nuclear medicine and industry locations.

In the arid region south of Mexicali, where the pale desert dominates the landscape, the Las Arenitas wetland feels like a mirage. But it is real, and is an oasis for endemic and migratory birds that cross the Colorado River delta. Here, just south of the US-Mexico border, used water from the city of Mexicali gets a second life. Half of it goes to the nearby Hardy River, in an attempt to revive ecosystems that were thought to be irrecoverable.

Historically, waterways here have been flushed full of sewage—particularly the New River, which runs off from the Colorado River northwards, crossing from Mexico into the United States and ending in the Salton Sea in California. For many years, this water course received untreated sewage from Mexicali, rendering it one of the worst-polluted rivers of its size in the US. In the 1990s, American and Mexican authorities could no longer ignore how bad the problem had become, and they began collaborating on infrastructure to lessen the pollution. And so, in 2007, south of Mexicali, the Las Arenitas treatment plant began operations.

Mexicali, which sits right on the border, generates more than 80 million cubic meters of sewage a year. Of that total, 90 percent is collected, with 46 percent of that going to Las Arenitas.

Mexicali is one of the hottest cities in the world. In summer, the region reaches 50°C.

In the sewage plant, solids and sediments are first removed from the wastewater. Next, surface-aerated lagoons are used, where air is injected into the water to stimulate the growth of aerobic bacteria, which decompose organic matter in the presence of oxygen. The water then passes to facultative lagoons, where aerobic and anaerobic bacteria complement each other, the latter degrading organic matter that the former could not. Finally, the water reaches the maturation lagoons, where the remaining solids settle out.

When it launched, this new system worked. “In the beginning, the plant did not perform ideally,” says Edith Santiago, deputy director of the Colorado River delta program in Mexicali at the conservation nonprofit the Sonoran Institute. To combat this, some organizations proposed to the water management agency that they should use the surrounding land, which decades ago housed a lake, to create an artificial wetland that would give the water additional cleanliness.

Such a plan, as well as helping with the city's sewage problem, would also help partially restore the local landscape to its former state. Before the overexploitation of the Colorado River, its delta crossed Baja California and Sonora until it met the waters of the Gulf of California, resulting in more than 400,000 hectares of wetlands. Although the river's course has become a ghost, about 15 percent of those wetlands have survived, harboring an invaluable biodiversity of plants and animals. Seeking to mimic that strength, the Las Arenitas artificial wetland is a pause to the devastation of the local landscape.

Edith Santiago, deputy director of the Colorado River delta program in Mexicali at the Sonoran Institute.

Construction of the wetlands began in 2009, a collaboration between the federal and state governments, water agencies, and investments obtained by the conservation nonprofit Pronatura Noroeste and the Sonoran Institute. In addition, they replaced obsolete equipment and made repairs to the plant.

“Wetlands are the kidneys of the planet—they help to filter and clean the water, to remove particles through the different plants,” explains Santiago. This process, where plants naturally cleanse water, is known as phytoremediation, and it occurs both underground in the roots of tule and alkaline reed, but also on the surface of the wetland waters, where microorganisms that degrade pollutants live.

Microscopic life within the wetlands cleanses the water in diverse ways, such as by transforming nitrogen into other substances and by assimilating phosphorus into its own biomass. In addition, physical processes such as sedimentation occur, in which smaller particles fall to the bottom of the water body.

The Revive the Colorado River Alliance reports that 50 percent of the water leaving the wetland flows into the Hardy River.

The wetlands' battle to maintain their balance is titanic, as the water treatment plant has been operating above capacity since 2013. The plant has an installed capacity of 840 liters per second, but it reaches 1,044 liters per second in some months. An expansion of the plant, while urgent, is yet to happen—though it has been on the table for more than five years.

It's possible to smell when the wetland ecosystem is out of kilter: The decomposition of organic matter there can generate unpleasant odors when these systems are under stress or out of balance, giving the environment an earthy, pungent aroma.

Assessing the quality of the treatment system's discharges is costly, and Santiago points out that there are two key things that could improve the processing of the water here further still: “Implementing better water use in the city, and new technology such as activated sludge in the plant, which uses less space than the lagoons and is faster.”

The Las Arenitas complex has transformed 99 hectares into a wetland.

When the wetland was designed, it was agreed that 30 percent of its annual water volume would flow along the Hardy River to the south for environmental use—that is, to sustain the life of this river, but also for the benefit of local communities, among them, the Cucapa indigenous group. The amount flowing into the Hardy River has now risen to 50 percent. “That the water from Las Arenitas flows along the Hardy River generates environmental potential; many species of birds and other wildlife use this area or live in it,” says Santiago.

Plants in wetlands help the process through phytoremediation.

Re-creating wetlands in the region also has a unique ecological benefit. In 2009, the first bird census in the area yielded about eight species and fewer than 100 birds in total. Six years later, researchers counted 160 different species, with a peak count of 18,000 birds. They have recorded Yuma clapper rails, brown pelicans, peregrine falcons, and northern shovelers.

An assessment of ecosystem services provided by the wetlands in the arid zone of Mexicali, published in 2023, highlighted the system's high potential for regulating water flows, promoting environmental education, and recharging the local aquifer.

That last point is an important one. The city of Mexicali depends on the Colorado River and its underground water reserves, but it uses water at an unsustainable rate. Annual recharge of the Mexicali Valley aquifer is 520.5 cubic hectometers (hm3), but more water is withdrawn from this underground store each year than reenters it (783.12 hm3). Meanwhile, the Colorado River is being squeezed to exhaustion, and is approaching a collapse that climate change is accelerating. Without Las Arenitas, the situation would be even worse, but drastically more needs to be done to balance the region's water use.

“My dream for Las Arenitas is that the community will come to enjoy it, but, at the same time, that there will be better water use in our homes so that less water reaches this area in poor conditions,” Santiago says.

Researchers from the University of Skövde, the University of Gothenburg, and the Sahlgrenska Academy have significantly advanced early detection of gynecological cancer. They have identified biomarkers that can indicate if someone has cancer. This discovery enables faster healthcare responses, thereby increasing the patient's chances of survival.

Each year, approximately 325,000 women receive a life-altering diagnosis of gynaecological cancer. For those who develop ovarian cancer, the future is often uncertain; only half survive five years after diagnosis. When cancer is detected late, survival rates drop drastically. However, there is now a glimmer of hope.

The research has made crucial progress by identifying specific biomarkers that allow for early detection of gynaecological cancer. This new discovery could eventually be integrated into healthcare, improving the chances of successful treatment.

We have identified several protein variants that can help distinguish between benign and malignant tumors. We are currently testing a panel of genetic changes to further enhance the accuracy of our diagnoses."

Benjamin Ulfenborg, Senior Lecturer in BioInformatics, University of Skövde

Cancer can hide in the body for a long time before symptoms appear, making early diagnosis challenging. The research team employs a technique combining protein analysis and genetic changes. These biological markers act as the body's own warning signals, capable of revealing the disease long before it spreads.

A specific part of the research targets women with endometriosis, a chronic condition affecting about one in ten women of reproductive age. The researchers have found that certain genetic alterations are shared between endometriosis and cancer, providing new insights into which patients may be at greater risk of developing cancer later.

"For these women, our research could lead to more personalised monitoring and earlier detection of potential cancer changes," says Benjamin Ulfenborg.

The method being developed by the researchers offers several advantages. Early cancer detection can save lives and reduce the need for extensive surgical interventions and treatments with severe side effects, granting patients more years of good health and better quality of life.

"Our goal is for this method to be routinely used in healthcare. By detecting cancer at an early stage, we can prevent unnecessary suffering and give more women the opportunity to live healthier lives," adds Benjamin Ulfenborg.

The project is a collaboration between several research groups. The University of Gothenburg and the Sahlgrenska Academy provide clinical samples and genetic analyses, while the University of Skövde contributes expertise in bioinformatics and statistical modelling. Together, they develop algorithms capable of handling large volumes of biological data to improve diagnostics. Research on early diagnosis is crucial to improving survival rates.

"Every success in this field gives more women a chance to survive their disease and live longer, healthier lives," concludes Benjamin Ulfenborg.

In 2016, EULAR - The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology - published recommendations on the treatment of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). Since then, new evidence has become available, so the recommendations have been reviewed and updated.

FMF is an autoinflammatory disease caused by a single gene. It is characterised by repeated attacks of fever and inflammation, and causes pain in the joints, lungs, and abdomen - which can have negative effects if left untreated. Although it is the most common of the monogenic autoinflammatory diseases, it is still rare - resulting in low awareness around the disease for both patients and healthcare professionals, and limited knowledge about its management options.

The last recommendations for FMF were published in 2016, but since then there have been new treatments developed, and new evidence collected. To address this, EULAR and PReS - the Paediatric Rheumatology European Society - have worked together to review and update the recommendations. Researchers, healthcare professionals, and patients worked together to develop this new advice.

The new work, published in the April 2025 issue of the Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, includes 12 individual recommendations and four overarching principles. These principles emphasise that FMF has a complex clinical presentation, which requires expertise in both diagnosis and management. They also stress that the treatment goal is to achieve at least minimal activity and control of subclinical inflammation to prevent damage - and that this will require lifetime management and prophylaxis. Good adherence is therefore important for people with FMF, and patient-centred management is useful to support patients in achieving good health and well-being.

The 12 new recommendations focus on key management steps, from first-line treatment with colchicine and dosing considerations through to second-line options and the biologic therapies that may be considered. Specific recommendations also deal with issues such as amyloidosis, pregnancy, symptomatic treatment during attacks, and measures of disease activity.

EULAR and PReS are confident that this revised set of recommendations will support rheumatologists and other healthcare professionals in managing FMF in patients of all ages. They note that the updates highlight the need for a holistic approach and attention to compliance - but there is still much to find out about this disease, and ongoing research will help to support continued updates in the future.

Hip replacement surgery, or total hip arthroplasty (THA), can lessen pain and improve function in individuals with hip osteoarthritis, but some patients continue to experience long-term physical deficits-including muscle weakness, decreased functional mobility, and increased fall risk-after the procedure. New research published in the Journal of Orthopaedic Research reveals that a patient's muscle quality before THA may predict their risk of such suboptimal recovery after surgery.

In the study, 10 people undergoing THA underwent imaging tests before surgery. Patients whose imaging results indicated poor muscle quality were more likely to perform poorly on movement tasks after surgery, compared with those with good muscle quality. The severity of patients' osteoarthritis before surgery (as indicated by the imaging tests performed) was not linked to their functional abilities after surgery.

The findings from this study indicate that hip muscle quality may be an important predictor of post-operative biomechanical recovery following hip replacement. Muscle quality is often overlooked, and magnetic resonance imaging is needed to visualize muscle composition, which is not routinely collected for hip replacement patients. Future studies will seek to understand possible implications for poor hip muscle quality on long-term functional outcomes."

New research published in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology found that mothers who are anemic in early pregnancy face a higher likelihood of giving birth to a child with a heart defect.

The study assessed the health records of 2,776 women with a child diagnosed with congenital heart disease who were matched to 13,880 women whose children did not have this condition.

Investigators found that 4.4% of children with congenital heart disease and 2.8% of children with normal heart function had anemia. After adjusting for potential influencing factors, the odds of giving birth to a child with congenital heart disease was 47% higher among anemic mothers.

We already know that the risk of congenital heart disease can be raised by a variety of factors, but these results develop our understanding of anemia specifically and take it from lab studies to the clinic. Knowing that early maternal anemia is so damaging could be a gamechanger worldwide. Because iron deficiency is the root cause of many cases of anemia, widespread iron supplementation for women-both when trying for a baby and when pregnant-could help prevent congenital heart disease in many newborns before it has developed."

A drug candidate, previously successful at treating severe fatty liver disease, reduces atherosclerosis - a primary driver of cardiovascular death worldwide - in large mammals, a study suggests.

DT-109 limited the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in both the aorta and coronary arteries of nonhuman primates.

The amino acid compound was developed at University of Michigan.

This glycine-based tripeptide also stopped critical processes that lead to vascular calcification, a significant catalyst of arterial stiffening and plaque instability.

Results of the study, conducted in partnership with Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, are published in Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy.

Atherosclerosis and vascular calcification remain among the leading global health threats, yet current standard-of-care medications fail to effectively address them.

DT-109 has demonstrated a remarkable ability to counteract the progression of atherosclerosis, an achievement that holds immense therapeutic potential."

Eugene Chen, M.D., Ph.D., co-senior author of the study and Frederick G. L. Huetwell Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School

Chen's team developed DT-109 in 2019 after it was discovered that impaired glycine metabolism can cause non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

In a 2023 study published in Cell Metabolism, the compound reversed fat buildup and prevented scarring in the livers of mice and nonhuman primates that had developed the most severe form of fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

NASH - renamed metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in 2023 - affects nearly 7% of the global population.

The condition is strongly associated with an elevated risk of atherosclerosis, which increases the likelihood of life-threatening events like heart attack and stroke.

"The emergence of DT-109 as a dual-action drug capable of treating both MASH and the vascular complications associated with atherosclerosis marks a significant advancement in the treatment landscape," said Jifeng Zhang, Ph.D., co-author and research professor of cardiovascular medicine at U-M Medical School.

"There is significant demand yet limited options for effective drug therapies to treat MASH, which leaves a critical gap in medical treatments that can effectively address both liver dysfunction and its cardiovascular effects."

During the 2025 study, researchers fed nonhuman primates a cholesterol-rich diet for 10 months before treating them with oral DT-109.

In addition to suppressing the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, DT-109 quelled chronic inflammation that is associated with calcification of the arteries.

This occurred in part by reducing signaling from the NLRP3 "inflammasome" protein, which plays a necessary role in vascular calcification.

"These results are of particular importance because they suggest that DT-109 could not only reduce atherosclerotic lesions but also prevent the vascular calcification that exacerbates arterial stiffness and plaque vulnerability in advanced atherosclerosis," Chen said.

"This presents an opportunity to address the root of the issue, rather than managing complications as they come up."

Current standard-of-care for treatment of atherosclerosis primarily involves lipid-lowering drugs, like statins and PCSK9 inhibitors, to manage cholesterol levels.

Those treatments, Chen says, fail to prevent vascular calcification and the progression of atherosclerosis and leave patients at continued risk for cardiovascular events.

The use of nonhuman primate models in these studies, researchers note, present a distinct advantage that could fast track evaluations of DT-109.

Compared to genetically modified mice, the primates exhibit a more accurate representation of human atherosclerosis and metabolic dysfunction.

"Our results in nonhuman primate models strengthens the potential for successful clinical translation, offering hope in a disease landscape currently devoid of effective treatments," Chen said.

"Given its ability to reduce liver damage, modulate lipid metabolism and inhibit the inflammatory pathways driving atherosclerosis, DT-109 is positioned as a groundbreaking candidate for clinical trials, with the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce the risks associated with cardiovascular events in those with MASH."

In this interview, Dr. Nimesh Khadka, Senior Product Application Specialist at Thermo Fisher Scientific, explores the role of Raman spectroscopy as a process analytical tool (PAT) in bioprocess monitoring, highlighting its molecular specificity, real-time capabilities, and advantages over traditional analytical methods like ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy.

Raman spectroscopy is a technique that examines how light interacts with molecules. When light interacts with vibrating molecules, most of it bounces unchanged – this is called a Rayleigh scattering. However, a small portion of the light shifts in energy because the molecules absorb or release small amounts of energy as they vibrate—this is known as Raman scattering. Although this scattered light is faint, it carries unique molecular fingerprints, helping scientists identify and measure different substances with precision.

Raman spectroscopy offers molecular specificity, which means it can identify molecules based on their distinct spectral fingerprints. Raman also works well in water-based solutions since water has a weak Raman signal. Because it's an optical and non-destructive technique, it can take frequent, data-rich measurements without affecting the sample. This helps to capture process variations in real-time. Raman can also detect multiple metabolites in a single scan without degrading samples, making it invaluable for dynamic bioprocess environments.

In addition, Raman spectroscopy can detect several key protein features, including amide I, II, and III regions, which reveal details about peptide bonds and secondary structures. Raman also picks up aromatic residues like phenylalanine and tryptophan, as well as disulfide bonds. These insights help scientists monitor protein behavior, detect aggregation, and assess structural configurations.

The speed of Raman analysis is particularly beneficial in bioprocessing. Real-time monitoring enables precise process control, such as initiating UF/DF at specific protein concentrations. It helps maintain consistent product quality, reduces costs, and saves time. Further, Raman can simultaneously monitor multiple parameters at once, enhancing understanding of bioprocess dynamics for better decision-making.

UV-Vis spectroscopy can be affected by other substances in the sample, such as tryptophan, leading to inaccurate protein concentration measurements. In contrast, Raman spectroscopy is unaffected by these interferences, ensuring more reliable data. It can also quantify proteins and excipients like sucrose and histidine in a single scan, giving a more complete picture of the process.

For example, we performed an experiment focused on monitoring protein concentrations during ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) in downstream monoclonal antibody production. Raman's performance was compared with in-line UV-Vis and at-line UV-Vis. The results showed Raman's high accuracy (less than 5% error) and showcased its ability to deliver reliable data even in the presence of interfering compounds like tryptophan.

In addition, Raman spectroscopy is highly specific, detecting only the target molecules without interference from others. In our experiment, UV-Vis overestimated protein concentrations by more than 70% due to tryptophan interference. In contrast, Raman accurately measured concentrations with less than 10% error since tryptophan did not affect the Raman signals in the targeted spectral regions.

Raman can be integrated into bioprocesses in three ways: in-line, at-line, or on-line. In-line uses immersible probes placed directly in the process for real-time monitoring and control. At-line requires taking samples for analysis off-line, while on-line involves sampling tubes to transport material to the Raman instrument. In-line Raman is most effective for continuous data collection and process control, ensuring consistent product quality.

There can be challenges with Raman analysis including baseline shifts, path length differences, and spectral overlaps. These issues are managed using data pre-processing techniques such as baseline removal (using filters like Savitzky-Golay) and normalization (e.g., water band normalization). Dimensionality reduction techniques like Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression help build robust chemometric models for accurate predictions.

Yes, Raman goes beyond basic monitoring to support crucial bioprocess quality control, such as deconvoluting protein secondary structures and quantifying protein aggregation. Raman can isolate protein-specific spectra from excipient interference and analyze beta-sheet content or aggregation profiles in real-time, proving deeper insights into process stability and product quality.

Yes, process Raman spectroscopy is a versatile tool for real-time monitoring and control in bioprocessing. Unlike traditional methods such as UV-Vis, it provides molecularly specific, non-destructive measurements, even in complex mixtures. Its application ensures high-quality outcomes in both upstream and downstream processes, making it a reliable and cost-effective solution for the biopharmaceutical industry.

Dr. Nimesh Khadka is a Senior Product Application Specialist at Thermo Fisher Scientific and holds a PhD in Biochemistry focusing on bioanalytical techniques.

With extensive expertise in spectroscopy and chemometrics, he is committed to driving innovation through process analytical technology (PAT). Dr. Khadka is particularly passionate about addressing complex challenges in bioprocessing by leveraging advanced tools. Currently, he is at the forefront of promoting Raman spectroscopy as a practical and effective solution for monitoring and controlling bioprocesses within the realm of PAT.

New analysis shows that pairing a low-sodium diet with DASH eating habits reduces cardiovascular risk by over 14%, with the biggest wins for women and Black adults facing high blood pressure.

In a recent article published in the American Journal of Preventive Cardiology, researchers used data collected in the United States to investigate how reducing sodium in the diet, either in isolation or while following the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, affects the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) over 10 years.

Their findings indicate that adherence to DASH dietary patterns and reducing dietary sodium independently reduced the risk of ASCVD, with the greatest benefits observed when the two interventions were combined.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of mortality, but over half of the cases are linked to modifiable lifestyle factors such as physical activity and diet. Across the U.S., unhealthy dietary habits, particularly excessive sodium intake, which more than 90% of American adults exceed, are major contributors to poor cardiovascular health.

The DASH diet, which is endorsed by national recommendations, encourages the intake of low-fat dairy, whole grains, vegetables, and fruits while reducing the consumption of added sugars, cholesterol, and saturated fats. It has been associated with lower CVD incidence, reduced cardiac injury, and decreased 10-year ASCVD risk.

While a previous trial called DASH-Sodium showed that both the DASH diet and sodium reduction were effective in improving blood pressure, their effects on the long-term risk of ASCVD were not analyzed.

In this study, researchers conducted a secondary analysis using data collected during the DASH-Sodium project to evaluate whether reducing sodium intake, alone or alongside the DASH diet, could lower the risk of ASCVD over ten years.

The researchers hypothesized that decreasing sodium consumption would reduce risk alone and that combining it with DASH dietary approaches would have an additive effect.

The DASH-Sodium project was a randomized, multi-center feeding study conducted between 1997 and 1999 in four U.S. clinical sites. It enrolled adults with elevated blood pressure who were at least 22 years old, while excluding those with insulin-dependent diabetes, heart disease, renal insufficiency, poorly controlled dyslipidemia, excessive alcohol intake, or those on antihypertensive medications. Participants were randomized to follow the DASH diet or an average American diet over 12 weeks. Each participant consumed three sodium levels—high, meaning 1.6 mg of sodium for each kilocalorie consumed (about 3,500 mg/day for a 2,000 kcal diet), medium (1.1 mg per kilocalorie, about 2,400 mg/day), or low (0.5 mg per kilocalorie, about 1,150 mg/day)—in random order. Each sodium level was consumed for about 30 days, with washout periods in between.

The study provided all meals, ensuring consistent nutrient intake. The highest sodium intake represented typical American consumption, while the medium matched guideline limits, and the lowest level was below the recommended intake.

The primary outcome was the ASCVD risk score over ten years, calculated using the Pooled Cohort Equation (PCE). Static risk factors like age and smoking were measured at baseline, while dynamic variables such as blood pressure and cholesterol were measured after each period of feeding.

Blood samples and blood pressure readings were collected using standardized methods. Data were analyzed using mixed effects models, accounting for repeated measures. Sensitivity analyses addressed participants outside the PCE's valid range by imputing or excluding out-of-range values. Stratified analyses assessed outcomes by age, sex, race, hypertension status, obesity, and smoking.

It is important to note that each sodium intervention period lasted only 30 days. While this allowed for controlled measurement of short-term changes in ASCVD risk scores, it does not provide evidence about the long-term impact of sustained dietary changes.

Among 390 participants, baseline characteristics were similar across the control and DASH diet groups. The DASH diet led to a greater reduction in the estimated ASCVD risk over ten years compared to the control diet, with an absolute difference of −0.12% and a relative difference of −5.33%.

Sodium reduction further decreased ASCVD risk, with low sodium intake showing greater risk reductions than medium or high sodium intake. Combined DASH diet and low sodium intake resulted in the largest decrease in ASCVD risk, with an absolute difference of −0.35%, and a relative difference of −14.09% compared to the control diet, which was high in sodium.

Stratified analysis showed stronger sodium reduction effects in women, Black adults, and those with stage 2 hypertension, while no significant differences were seen by age, obesity, or smoking status. Sensitivity analyses supported these findings.

The study also noted that race was dichotomized as Black versus non-Black, so effects among other minoritized groups could not be determined.

The DASH diet significantly lowered the estimated 10-year ASCVD risk compared to a typical American diet. Sodium reduction further reduced risk, especially when combined with the DASH diet, with greater benefits among women, Black adults, and those with stage 2 hypertension.

These results align with previous evidence supporting DASH and sodium reduction for cardiovascular health. However, no long-term randomized trials have confirmed DASH's effect on actual CVD events, as most evidence is based on risk factor and risk score reduction, not direct clinical outcomes. The optimal sodium intake level also remains debated.

Nevertheless, even moderate sodium reductions appeared beneficial, reinforcing public health efforts to reduce sodium intake. The authors note that the study's exclusion criteria (such as individuals with existing heart disease, diabetes, or those on antihypertensive drugs) and the relatively short intervention periods may limit the generalizability of the findings. Future research should focus on long-term outcomes, include a broader range of participants, and further refine sodium intake guidelines.

A sweeping global review shows that the Mediterranean diet significantly reduces breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women, with Asian populations seeing the strongest effects, highlighting the diet's potential as a strategic prevention tool.

Review: Adherence to Mediterranean Diet and Breast Cancer Risk: A Meta-Analysis of Prospective Observational Studies. Image Credit: Sea Wave / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Health Science Reports, researchers evaluated the associations between adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) and breast cancer risk.

Breast cancer is a significant public health concern, accounting for a substantial proportion of cancer diagnoses among women. As such, exploring effective prevention strategies remains crucial, focusing on lifestyle factors, such as diet. The MD has drawn substantial research interest due to its associations with health benefits. Moreover, studies suggest an inverse relationship between adherence to the MD and breast cancer risk, albeit some inconsistencies remain. The mechanisms underlying this relationship may include the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of the diet, as well as hormonal factors, particularly in postmenopausal women.

In the present study, researchers examined the evidence on the relationship between the MD and breast cancer risk. First, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for case-control and cohort studies examining adherence to the MD and its association with breast cancer risk. They also reported risk estimates using odds, relative, or hazard ratios.

Studies that lacked quantitative data, non-original studies (e.g., reviews), and those involving other dietary patterns were excluded. Next, relevant data from studies were extracted; these included sample size, participant characteristics (age, menopausal status), dietary assessment methods and duration, alcohol intake, and risk estimates. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).

Further, the meta-analysis was performed by pooling risk estimates comparing the lowest and highest levels of MD adherence. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I-squared statistic, and publication bias was examined using Funnel plots and Begg's test. In addition, the team performed subgroup analyses by study design, regions, and menopausal status to analyze whether these variables modified risk estimates. The researchers also conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of their findings and examined the impact of adjusting for alcohol consumption, an element of the Mediterranean diet whose role in breast cancer risk is debated.

The comprehensive database search yielded 2,189 records. Following deduplication and title/abstract screening, full texts of 43 studies were reviewed, resulting in the inclusion of 31 studies. These included 19 case-control and 12 cohort studies published between 2006 and 2023. Participants were aged 20–104 years across studies.

The quality of included studies was generally high, with case-control and cohort studies scoring 3–9 and 6–9 on the NOS, respectively. The meta-analysis indicated a significant association between MD adherence and lower breast cancer risk overall, with substantial heterogeneity across studies. However, for premenopausal women, there was no significant risk reduction, with some heterogeneity across studies.

By contrast, for postmenopausal women, there was a significant decrease in breast cancer risk associated with adherence to the MD, with moderate heterogeneity. Further, cohort studies with less than and over 20 years of follow-up showed no significant differences in breast cancer risk. By geographical region, studies performed in Asia showed the strongest associations between MD adherence and breast cancer risk.

European studies showed moderate associations, while American studies had insignificant associations. For premenopausal women in cohort studies, the MD had no effect on breast cancer risk; likewise, the marginal association in case-control studies appeared overestimated. By region, premenopausal women had no significant risk reduction across Asia, the Americas, or Europe.

For postmenopausal women in cohort studies, there was a modest decrease in breast cancer risk associated with MD adherence, while a stronger protective effect was noted in case-control studies. Moreover, there was a moderate risk reduction in Europeans, a weaker, insignificant reduction in Americans, and a stronger association in Asians.

The analysis also found that including or excluding alcohol as a component of the Mediterranean diet influenced the magnitude of risk reduction in some subgroups, especially among postmenopausal women, highlighting the complex and still-debated role of alcohol in breast cancer prevention.

A leave-one-out sensitivity analysis found no outlier studies, supporting the robustness of the findings.

Limitations of the study include differences in findings between cohort and case-control studies, with case-control studies generally showing a stronger association but also having a higher risk of recall bias and other methodological challenges. Additionally, variations in how the Mediterranean diet is defined and implemented across different regions—often due to cultural factors—may have contributed to inconsistent results. The authors note that further research should consider breast cancer subtypes, hormone receptor status, genetic predispositions, and lifestyle factors to more fully understand the potential protective role of the Mediterranean diet.

In sum, the findings of the meta-analysis indicate a 13% lower risk of breast cancer associated with adherence to the MD, especially in postmenopausal women. There were no significant effects for premenopausal women. Geographically, Asian populations had the strongest protective effects, with moderate associations in Europeans and Americans. While these results suggest that the MD may be a promising diet to prevent breast cancer, the authors emphasize the need for additional, well-designed studies across diverse populations and regions, and taking into account the complexity of diet composition and other risk factors.

Telemedicine use in 2023 reduced monthly carbon dioxide emissions by the equivalent of up to 130,000 gas operated vehicles, suggesting it could have a positive effect on climate change, new UCLA-led research finds.

The findings, to be published April 22 in the peer-reviewed American Journal of Managed Care, suggest that telemedicine could have a modest but noticeable impact on the environment by decreasing the number of vehicles traveling to and from medical appointments. They could also have policy implications, said co-senior author Dr. John N. Mafi, associate professor-in-residence of medicine in the division of general internal medicine and health services research at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.

As Congress debates whether to extend or modify pandemic-era telehealth flexibilities, our results provide important evidence for policymakers to consider, namely that telemedicine has the potential to reduce the carbon footprint of US health care delivery."

Dr. John N. Mafi, associate professor-in-residence of medicine, division of general internal medicine and health services research, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA

The U.S. health system now contributes about 9%, and transportation comprises about 29%, of greenhouse emissions in the country, the researchers write in the paper.

The researchers used de-identified data from the Milliman MedInsight Emerging Experience database to quantify nearly 1.5 million telemedicine visits, including about 66,000 in rural areas, during the April 1 through June 30, 2023 study period. They estimated that between 741,000 and 1.35 million of those were substitutes for in-person visits.

Extrapolating from these calculations, the researchers estimate that CO2 emissions were reduced by between 21.4 million and 47.6 million kg each month in the U.S. due to telemedicine use, which translates to the amount produced by 61,000 to 130,000 gas powered vehicles or recycling 1.8 million to 4 million trash bags.

"The health care sector contributes significantly to the global carbon footprint," said Dr. A. Mark Fendrick, professor of medicine and director of Center for Value-Based Insurance Design at the University of Michigan and the study's co-senior author. "Our findings suggest that the environmental impact of medical care delivery can be reduced when lower-carbon options, such as telemedicine, are substituted for other services that produce more emissions."

The researchers note some limitations to their findings. Their sampling method was based on data that was from a single, easy to access source rather than a random selection, so the findings may not represent the broader population or account for regional variations. Also, driving distances and vehicle market share were based on data sources from before 2023, though driving distances to in-person care were not likely to differ much from what they were prior to that year. Finally, telemedicine use has fallen since the end of the COVID pandemic, which may have led the researchers to overestimate the amount of emissions averted due to variations in telemedicine use rates.

Study co-authors also include Dr. Benjo Delarmente, Artem Romanov, Manying Cui, Chi-Hong Tseng, and Dr. Catherine Sarkisian of UCLA; Melody Craff, Dale Skinner, and Michael Hadfield of Milliman MedInsight, and Cheryl Damberg of RAND.

The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Aging.

The University of Queensland will play a key role in a national effort to revolutionize treatment for men with prostate cancer.

Radiopharmaceutical company AdvanCell has received $18 million from the Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) to develop and deliver targeted alpha therapies for prostate cancer, which is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men.

UQ's expertise in imaging and diagnostics will help AdvanCell progress a promising new class of treatment which delivers highly potent alpha radiation directly to cancer cells while minimising harm to healthy tissue.

AdvanCell Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Anna Karmann said our MRFF funded research will accelerate the development and translation of promising targeted alpha therapy combinations.

By partnering with outstanding researchers at UQ, and leading clinical investigators, we leverage novel tools and technologies combined with innovative clinical approaches to advance precision patient care and improve clinical outcomes for men with prostate cancer." 

Dr. Anna Karmann, AdvanCell Chief Medical Officer

At UQ's Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN) researchers will contribute to key areas to inform how, when and where these new therapies are delivered to patients, and their impact on tissues in the body. 

Deputy Director Professor Kristofer Thurecht said AIBN's role was to help develop strategies that show how radiation affects cancer cells and design new diagnostic tools that reveal how a patient's immune system is responding to treatment.

"This will enable AdvanCell to identify suitable patients for clinical trials, monitor how well the therapy is working, and adjust treatment strategies in real time as needed," Professor Thurecht said.

"Ultimately, this will make targeted alpha therapy more precise and effective." 

At UQ's Centre for Clinical Research, Dr Kevin Koo's lab is analysing patient samples in collaboration with AdvanCell to uncover why some prostate cancer patients respond better to treatment than others. 

"Every patient and tumour is different, which is why we're trying to understand why some respond exceptionally well to targeted alpha therapy," Dr Koo said.

"This knowledge will help clinicians personalise therapies and improve outcomes."

Head of AdvanCell's Translational Medicine and Clinical Science, Professor Stephen Rose, said the funding was an important step for Australian innovation to improve the lives of men with prostate cancer. 

"This investment allows us to accelerate the translation of our Targeted Alpha Therapy - one of the most promising advances in cancer treatment. 

"Our multidisciplinary multi-institutional approach is key to defeating prostate cancer."

A powerful clinical artificial intelligence tool developed by University at Buffalo biomedical informatics researchers has demonstrated remarkable accuracy on all three parts of the United States Medical Licensing Exam (Step exams), according to a paper published today (April 22) in JAMA Network Open.

Achieving higher scores on the USMLE than most physicians and all other AI tools so far, Semantic Clinical Artificial Intelligence (SCAI, pronounced "Sky") has the potential to become a critical partner for physicians, says lead author Peter L. Elkin, MD, chair of the Department of Biomedical Informatics in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB and a physician with UBMD Internal Medicine.

Elkin says SCAI is the most accurate clinical AI tool available to date, with the most advanced version scoring 95.2% on Step 3 of the USMLE, while a GPT4 Omni tool scored 90.5% on the same test.

As physicians, we are used to using computers as tools, but SCAI is different; it can add to your decision-making and thinking based on its own reasoning."

Peter L. Elkin, MD, Chair of the Department of Biomedical Informatics, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB

The tool can respond to medical questions posed by clinicians or the public at https://halsted.compbio.buffalo.edu/chat/.

The researchers tested the model against the USMLE, required for licensing physicians nationwide, which assesses the physician's ability to apply knowledge, concepts and principles, and to demonstrate fundamental patient-centered skills. Any questions with a visual component were eliminated.

Elkin explains that most AI tools function by using statistics to find associations in online data that allow them to answer a question. "We call these tools generative artificial intelligence," he says. "Some have postulated that they are just plagiarizing what's on the internet because the answers they give you are what others have written." However, these AI models are now becoming partners in care rather than simple tools for clinicians to utilize in their practice, he says.

"But SCAI answers more complex questions and performs more complex semantic reasoning," he says, "We have created knowledge sources that can reason more the way people learn to reason while doing their training in medical school."

The team started with a natural language processing software they had previously developed. They added vast amounts of authoritative clinical information gleaned from widely disparate sources ranging from recent medical literature and clinical guidelines to genomic data, drug information, discharge recommendations, patient safety data and more. Any data that might be biased, such as clinical notes, were not included.

SCAI contains 13 million medical facts, as well as all the possible interactions between those facts. The team used basic clinical facts known as semantic triples (subject-relation-object, such as "Penicillin treats pneumococcal pneumonia") to create semantic networks. The tool can then represent these semantic networks so that it is possible to draw logical inferences from them.

"We have taught large language models how to use semantic reasoning," says Elkin.

Other techniques that contributed to SCAI include knowledge graphs that are designed to find new links in medical data as well as previously "hidden" patterns, as well as retrieval-augmented generation, which allows the large language model to access and incorporate information from external knowledge databases before responding to a prompt. This reduces "confabulation," the tendency for AI tools to always respond to a prompt even when it doesn't have enough information to go on.

Elkin adds that using formal semantics to inform the large language model provides important context necessary for SCAI to understand and respond more accurately to a particular question.

"SCAI is different from other large language models because it can have a conversation with you and as a human-computer partnership can add to your decision-making and thinking based on its own reasoning," Elkin says.

He concludes: "By adding semantics to large language models, we are providing them with the ability to reason similarly to the way we do when practicing evidence-based medicine."

Because it can access such vast amounts of data, SCAI also has the potential to improve patient safety, improve access to care and "democratize specialty care," Elkin says, by making medical information on specialties and subspecialties accessible to primary care providers and even to patients.

While the power of SCAI is impressive, Elkin stresses its role will be to augment, not replace, physicians.

"Artificial intelligence isn't going to replace doctors," he says, "but a doctor who uses AI may replace a doctor who does not."

In addition to Elkin, UB co-authors from the Department of Biomedical Informatics are Guresh Mehta; Frank LeHouillier; Melissa Resnick, PhD; Crystal Tomlin, PhD; Skyler Resendez, PhD; and Jiaxing Liu. 

Sarah Mullin, PhD, of Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Jonathan R. Nebeker, MD, and Steven H. Brown, MD, both of the Department of Veterans Affairs, also are co-authors.

The work was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

A new study led by the University of Zurich has shown that evidence of genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia can be found in the retina. This finding could help improve the early detection of the disorder.

The retina is part of the central nervous system and therefore a direct extension of the brain. This is why changes in the brain could potentially also be detected in our eyes. An international team of researchers led by the University of Zurich and the University Hospital of Psychiatry Zurich has now tackled this very question. In their study, the researchers examined whether changes in our nerve connections are linked to a genetic risk for schizophrenia, as impaired neural information processing is one of the main characteristics of the disorder.

Previous studies suggest that schizophrenia not only reduces volume of gray matter in the brains of those affected, but that it also leads to loss of retinal tissue. However, whether these changes are the cause of schizophrenia or a consequence of the disorder has remained unanswered. Retinal health could also be affected by schizophrenia itself, for example through antipsychotic medication, lifestyle factors or diabetes.

To investigate whether the risk of developing schizophrenia has an effect on the central nervous system, we examined tens of thousands of healthy individuals. We then calculated polygenic risk scores for each individual."

Finn Rabe, first author of the study and postdoc, University of Zurich

The researchers were able to use extensive genetic and retinal data taken from the UK Biobank, a large biomedical database containing data from over half a million people. "You could say that the scale of the UK Biobank's data has revolutionized biomedical research," the researcher adds.

The study shows that higher genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia is indeed associated with thinner retinas. However, the effects are small and can only be reliably demonstrated in large-scale studies. One of the study's findings is that, unlike changes in the brain, changes in the retina are easy to detect using non-invasive and inexpensive retinal measurements. Thanks to optical coherence tomography, which can be described as a kind of ultrasound for the eye, retinal thickness can be measured within a matter of minutes.

This offers a promising outlook for prevention. "Our study shows the potential of using optical coherence tomography in clinical practice. But large-scale longitudinal studies are needed to examine how useful it will be for prevention," says Finn Rabe.

Another key finding of the study concerns genetic variants associated with inflammatory processes in the brain. These may also contribute to structural changes in the retina. The study thus offers further support for the inflammation hypothesis of schizophrenia, i.e., the idea that inflammatory processes contribute to the development or progression of the disorder. "If this hypothesis is confirmed, inflammation could be interrupted by medication, potentially enabling us to improve treatment possibilities in the future," says Rabe.

PCR genetic analysis has been in the spotlight since COVID-19, but light is now further facilitating PCR-free methods.

Osaka Metropolitan University scientists have developed a light-induced DNA detection technique, using heterogeneous probe particles, that enables ultra-sensitive and ultra-fast genetic analysis without the need for PCR amplification. This advancement is lighting the way for faster, more affordable, and precise genetic analysis across medicine, environmental science, and portable diagnostics.

As a means of analyzing changes in DNA, genetic testing - which is essential for diagnosing infectious diseases, detecting early-stage cancer, verifying food safety, and analyzing environmental DNA - has long relied on PCR (polymerase chain reaction) as the gold standard. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the term "PCR" has become part of our common vocabulary. But as those of us who have experienced them know, PCR tests are neither cheap nor fast; they typically require centralized labs, bulky equipment, and specially trained personnel.

"Our light-induced method detects DNA without the need for PCR," write Shuichi Toyouchi, a Project Lecturer, Prof. Shiho Tokonami, the Deputy Director, and Takuya Iida, the Director at Osaka Metropolitan University's Research Institute for Light-induced Acceleration System (RILACS), as the lead authors of this study.

Unlike PCR, which amplifies DNA sequences by making millions of copies of target DNA for detection, this method directly detects DNA by concentrating it and enhancing specificity through strong optical forces and photothermal effect.

The team developed a system using heterogeneous probe particles, including gold nanoparticles and polystyrene microparticles. These probes are short, known DNA sequences designed to hybridize, or bind, with complementary sequences in the target DNA. This process, known as DNA hybridization, allows the matching strands to bind together, making the pairing detectable through fluorescence.

The researchers then irradiated, with laser light, the solution containing the target DNA and probe particles. When the particle size matches the laser wavelength, a phenomenon called Mie scattering occurs, generating optical forces that move the particles and accelerate DNA hybridization. The gold nanoparticles absorb laser light, creating localized heat, or photothermal effect, to further enhance the hybridization specificity.

"Using just about five minutes of laser light irradiation, our method demonstrated great potential for accurate mutation detection with a sensitivity one order of magnitude higher than that of digital PCR.," Toyouchi, Tokonami, and Iida write.

By eliminating the need for PCR amplification, this method reduces costs, simplifies testing, and accelerates results, making genetic analysis more accessible in daily life applications - from healthcare and food safety to environmental conservation and personal health tracking.

"We aim to apply this PCR-free technology to high-sensitivity cancer diagnostics, quantum life science research, and even at-home or environmental DNA testing," Iida said.

The study was published in ACS Sensors.

Body appreciation differs between Middle-Eastern and Western societies, a new international study can reveal, highlighting how cultural and family influences shape body image and eating behaviors in young women.

Led by Flinders University and published in the journal Body Image, the study surveyed over 850 women aged 18–25 in Australia and Lebanon, examining the roles that mothers and sisters play in shaping body dissatisfaction, body appreciation, and eating patterns.

Lead author, registered psychologist and PhD candidate Melanie Deek, says the study found that while both groups of women shared similar levels of body dissatisfaction, Middle-Eastern women reported higher body appreciation compared to their Western counterparts.

Our findings challenge commonly held assumptions that negative body image is universally experienced in the same way.

Middle-Eastern women, in particular, showed stronger body appreciation, which may reflect cultural values and close family relationships that promote self-acceptance.

This suggests that family and cultural values in the Middle East may help foster a more positive view of one's body, which could serve as a potential protective factor for negative body-image and disordered eating behaviors."

Melanie Deek, lead author, registered psychologist and PhD candidate from the College of Education, Psychology and Social Work

The study highlights the significant influence of family, particularly mothers, on both positive and negative body image outcomes.

"Mothers, more than sisters, were found to have a consistently stronger impact when it came to shaping eating behaviors and body image," Ms. Deek explains.

"Interestingly, while Middle-Eastern women reported more frequent 'fat talk'-discussions about weight and appearance-within families, these conversations were linked to positive outcomes, like increased body appreciation-suggesting a more nuanced cultural dynamic."

The study also found differences in eating behaviors, with Middle-Eastern women more likely to engage in mindful eating practices, such as eating without distractions-habits associated with better mental and physical health.

"Their focus on mindful eating may contribute not only to healthier eating habits but also to a more positive body image," says Deek.

Senior researcher Professor Ivanka Prichard, a body image expert, says the findings challenge the assumption that body image concerns are largely Western.

"Western beauty ideals are spreading globally, but this study shows that cultural and familial factors still play a powerful role in shaping how young women see themselves," Professor Prichard says.

"To effectively address body dissatisfaction and disordered eating, we must develop culturally tailored interventions-not one-size-fits-all solutions."

The research team plans to expand the study to include more Middle-Eastern regions, especially areas less influenced by Western beauty norms, and explore how these findings translate in multicultural societies like Australia.

"Our work underscores the need for inclusive, culturally sensitive approaches to promote positive body image and healthy eating behaviors across the globe," concludes Ms. Deek.

University of Michigan researchers have found that certain psychedelic compounds improve the brain's ability to adapt and flexibly learn new concepts over long periods.

This kind of cognitive flexibility is impaired in many psychiatric and neurological conditions.

“Psychedelic compounds are being tested in ongoing clinical trials attempting to treat depression and PTSD,” said Omar Ahmed, U-M associate professor of psychology and senior author of the newly published study.

“These conditions, as well as Alzheimer's disease, are often accompanied by decreased cognitive flexibility. We find that a single psychedelic dose can boost flexible learning over several weeks in mice, highlighting the ability of these compounds to induce long-lasting and functionally important changes to the brain.”

The team discovered that one dose of the psychedelic compound 25CN-NBOH helped mice think more flexibly and do better in behavioral tests even weeks after drug administration.

This research, which appeared in the journal Psychedelics, highlights why clinical trials of psychedelic drugs may benefit people living with depression or PTSD.

Clinical trial designs for depression use only one or two doses. Our results show, in mouse models, that even a single dose of a psychedelic can result in lasting benefits. We studied flexible learning up to three weeks after the single dose and saw improvements. The benefits may last even longer.”

Elizabeth Brouns, U-M psychology master's student and study's first author

The present study utilized rodent models, but the results are likely to translate well to humans.

“The mice nervous system is an excellent model system to understand how psychedelic drugs function. Neurons in the prefrontal cortex of mice, as well as of humans, express serotonin 2a receptors, which are the primary target of psychedelic drugs. These serotonin 2a receptors are also considered to be responsible for the therapeutic benefits of psychedelic treatments,” according to study co-author Tyler Ekins, U-M postdoctoral fellow in psychology.

The tests involved injecting mice with either the psychedelic compound or a control placebo injection. The mice were introduced to an automated training device called the FED3, which gave them food pellets as rewards for poking their noses into distinct holes in the correct sequence.

After the mice became proficient at remembering this sequence over several days, the rules of the task were suddenly reversed, requiring the mice to learn to now visit the holes in the opposite sequence. Both male and female mice treated with the psychedelic learned this new rule more quickly than mice given control injections, even three weeks after the psychedelic was first administered.

This automated task design, developed by the team, marks an advance in how scientists study flexible learning over long durations. Designed to streamline the evaluation of cognitive adaptability, this innovation opens the door to more efficient and precise research into the effects of psychedelic compounds on the brain, requiring only infrequent human intervention, the researchers noted.

Despite the findings, Ahmed cautions that many questions remain. Psychedelic medicine is still in its infancy but progressing quickly, he said.

“A lot of fundamental, basic science and translational research is needed to ensure that clinical trials utilize optimal versions and doses of psychedelic drugs,” Ahmed said.

For example, the current study focused on the long-term effects of a single psychedelic dose. One key question is what happens with two, three or even 20 doses taken over several months. Is every additional dose increasingly beneficial for flexible learning, or is there a plateau effect or even a negative effect of too many doses? These are important questions to answer next in the quest to make psychedelic medicine more rational and mechanistic, he said.

Researchers reveal that many children's mattresses release high levels of hazardous chemicals during sleep, raising fresh concerns about everyday exposure in early life.

 Study: Are Sleeping Children Exposed to Plasticizers, Flame Retardants, and UV-Filters from Their Mattresses? Image Credit: granata68 / Shutterstock.com

A recent study in Environmental Science & Technology measures semivolatile organic compound (SVOC) levels in children's sleeping microenvironment (SME).

Infants and children up to four years of age spend an average of 18 hours every day in their SME, which may consist of mattresses, pillows, toys, bedding materials, and the air surrounding their immediate sleeping area.

Previous studies have reported that SMEs often contain harmful chemicals, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs), and biological contaminants, including mites, bacteria, and fungi. Recently, SVOCs, such as stain repellents, plasticizers, and flame retardants, have been detected in many mattresses.

Since SVOC additives are not chemically attached to mattress materials, they have the potential to contaminate the surrounding air, clothing, dust, toys, and skin surfaces. This migration of SVOCs, which are high-fugacity materials, may occur due to their passive diffusion to a lower fugacity, thereby achieving chemical equilibrium.

Children's movements through shifting positions while sleeping or bouncing on a mattress also accelerate SVOC migration, which subsequently increases exposure to these harmful chemicals. In fact, previous studies have estimated that the SVOC inhalation rate among children is 10 times higher than that of adults.

In addition to inhalation and dermal exposure from sleeping on mattresses for prolonged periods, frequent hand-to-mouth and mouthing activities by children also increase their susceptibility to SVOC exposure.

Children's exposure to certain SVOCs, such as ortho-phthalates (PAEs) and certain organophosphate esters (OPEs), increases the risk of allergic diseases like asthma. These chemicals can also trigger adverse neurobehavioral outcomes, including effects on cognitive ability, prosocial behavior, and working memory.

Several countries, including Canada, have begun enforcing regulations to limit the use of some SVOCs, including benzyl butyl phthalate (BzBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), in mattresses and toys. Canada and the United States have also banned the use of foam-based products, including tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCiPP) and tris(chloropropyl) phosphate (TCPP), in mattresses intended for children three years of age and younger.

In the current study, a total of 16 new, low-cost, and varied certified children's mattresses (M1-M16) were purchased from major North American retailers. All mattresses were evaluated for the presence of selected SVOCs, with compliance to Canadian regulations.

M1-M16 were tested for carcinogenic flame retardants. PAEs, such as DBP, BzBP, and DEHP, were also measured to ensure that these mattresses adhered to safety limits set by U.S. regulations for children's products, including their mattresses.

A total of 45 analytes were tested, including OPEs, PAEs, BPs, and 5 SALs. All experiments were conducted at the University of Toronto.

Of the 45 test analytes, 21 were detected in 16 mattresses with detection frequencies (DFs) of 88% for tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) and 6.3% for TCEP, methyl salicylate (M-SAL), and tris (2-isopropyl phenyl) phosphate (T2IPPP).

No association was established between the total number of SVOCs detected in covers and foam and the mattress cost. Likewise, no relationship was observed between total SVOC concentrations and the type of polymer used in the cover, such as flexible polypropylene (PP), rigid polyvinyl chloride (PVC), or polyethylene (PE) copolymer.

The researchers did not find any association between SVOC concentration and the country in which the mattress components were manufactured.

SVOCs were consistently found in the mattresses' foam and cover, thus indicating that these materials may function as the primary source of contamination. While high levels of BPs, PAEs, and SALs were detected in the covers, all tested OPEs were found at higher concentrations in the foam, except for TBOEP.

Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis revealed that mattress covers and foams are rich sources of TCEP and TCPPs, which can potentially migrate into the cover materials. Several mattress covers contained DiBP and DiNP concentrations exceeding the permitted levels in Canada.

Both emissions and DFs were significantly higher in the presence of heat, weight, and a combination of both. Thus, children's body heat and weight increase SVOC emissions, and as a result, their exposure to these harmful chemicals increases.

The researchers estimated that children would be exposed to at least seven SVOCs detected in the mattress sampler and SME air samplers. In SME, the highest air concentrations were for BzBP, followed by DnBP.

Manufacturers should improve the oversight of their products so that they do not violate regulations, that they comply with their own product certificaitons, improve manufacturing practices so that unintended contamination is minized, and that such chemicals are not use when not needed.”

Mattresses are a significant source of SVOC exposure to young children in their SMEs, thus emphasizing the crucial need to update current regulations to restrict children's exposure to harmful chemicals. Nevertheless, additional studies using larger sample sizes are needed to validate these findings.

The Club World Cup will soon be in Atlanta. Tickets are still available.

A combination of ticket prices, event fatigue, unfamiliarity and anticipation are some of the reasons soccer supporters in Atlanta said they aren't overly excited about attending this summer's Club World Cup matches at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

The city is scheduled to host six matches in the tournament, starting with a group-stage match June 16 and finishing with a quarterfinal July 5. Some of the teams that will be here, Chelsea and Manchester City, are among the best in the world.

But potentially getting to watch Erling Haaland or Cole Palmer or Lionel Messi, who should be here with Inter Miami, has a price. Using StubHub on Wednesday, prices for a ticket start at $657, excluding fees and taxes, for a group-stage match and go as high as $11,137 for the quarterfinal. Using Ticketmaster, FIFA's provider, prices for a ticket start at $83.65, excluding fees and taxes, for a group-stage match and go as high as $657.85 for the quarterfinal.

“Don't really care to see any of the teams playing for those prices,” Jordan Comer posted on X. “Also, saving money for the real thing next summer!”

The real thing is the World Cup. Atlanta and Mercedes-Benz Stadium are scheduled to host eight matches in that tournament.



It's a lot of soccer in the city.

In addition to Atlanta United's 17 home matches, the city in the past few years has hosted part of the SheBelieves Cup, the Leagues Cup, friendlies between Premier League teams, with two more on tap this summer, and Copa America matches.

That may be why FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who was in town last week to promote the Club World Cup, reminded people that tickets are still available.

“So much sports, and tournaments ran throughout the year that it feels like overkill,” Juan Alonso, who lives in South Georgia, posted on X. “That excitement and buzz is lost somewhat.”

Some in Atlanta are excited.

“Going to a few games,” Smyrna's Adam Dittmer posted on X. “I think it will be an experience, but it lacks some meaning if you are not a fan of the clubs. Seeing great teams in their home stadiums is also part of the appeal in seeing some teams.”

Not understanding the difference between the Club World Cup and World Cup is a hurdle for casual sports fans.

The Club World Cup is a tournament for teams that play in leagues, such as Manchester City in the Premier League. The tournament was first held in 2000. Teams that win each FIFA region's Champions League, or place high, are among those that qualify. The prize money has increased from $28 million distributed to eight teams when it started to $1 billion distributed to 32 teams this summer. Real Madrid has the most championships (5).

The World Cup is for national teams, such as the United States, Brazil or Argentina. Some of the players who will compete for their clubs in this summer's Club World Cup will compete for their national teams in next summer's World Cup. Next year's host nations are the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

Regardless of how some Atlantans feel about the Club World Cup, there still will be thousands of people attending the matches in the city because the teams have passionate supporters. FIFA, which declined to provide ticket sales totals, said people from more than 130 countries have purchased tickets for tournament matches.

Former Atlanta United Vice President Carlos Bocanegra, speaking Wednesday in interviews set up by FIFA and focused on the Club World Cup, said the soccer that people could see at this summer's tournament may be better than what they may see in next summer's World Cup.

Bocanegra, who played for the U.S. more than 100 times, said one of the benefits of the Club World Cup is that players already know one another. Unlike when playing for a national team, when players have just a few days to learn each other and work on what the manager wants, the club teams have been playing together and working with the manager for months to years.

“The football could be a little bit more fluid,” he said.

Bocanegra also discussed the spectacle of the supporters at the games may add to the enjoyment.

“If people don't know about the Flamengoes of the world or Palmeiras or Boca Juniors or River Plate, they're really going to see how big of a following that those teams have when they show up to the stadium and watch these teams play,” he said. “They are iconic teams and have massive following, not only in their home country, but here in the United States because we have so many expats from all over the world. So I do think that's going to be a pretty cool experience, and just a big party for these people to enjoy watching their teams play and competing against the best of the best.”

Former Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger on Wednesday said that those who do watch the Club World Cup may get a chance to see not only the bona fide stars such as Real Madrid's Vinicius, but also players who are unknowns now but can become world-class.

“Hope I will have surprises from Africa, from Asia, from Oceania, from South America, and that we discover some players, and this tournament could help us to discover some new players,” he said. “It's a unique opportunity for players who don't go to the World Cup because we have about 87 or 90 different countries who will be represented by players who do not go to the World Cup and can win the (Club) World Cup.”

As hundreds of thousands of soccer fans from around the world flock to Atlanta for the World Cup next summer, State Farm Arena wants in on the action. 

The arena is launching a concert series it calls Summer Kickoff ATL, which will run between June and July of next year, according to a Wednesday press release. A lineup and specific dates have yet to be determined, though artists have already expressed interest in being a part of the event, said Andrew Saltzman, State Farm Arena's president of business enterprise and chief commercial officer.

“When you look back and think about what the summer of 2026 did for the city of Atlanta, we want State Farm Arena to be seen as an epicenter of entertainment,” Saltzman said in an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Atlanta is one of 16 cities across the U.S., Mexico and Canada slated to host matches for the 2026 World Cup. Eight matches will be held at Mercedes-Benz Stadium between June 11 and July 19.

Next to the Centennial Olympic Games in 1996, hosting the eight World Cup matches is said to be the second-most important sporting event in Atlanta's history. The matches are projected to have an economic impact of $503.2 million from just out-of-state visitors, according to a study produced by Jerry D. Parrish for the Metro Atlanta Chamber, who described the projections as conservative. Each match will be like hosting a Super Bowl. The study estimates the matches will attract about 520,000 spectators in total, about 225,000 of which will come from out of state.

State Farm Arena has a history of hosting concerts ahead of major sporting events. Earlier this year, the arena hosted a two-day concert series dubbed AT&T Playoff Playlist Live as part of College Football Playoff National Championship weekend. Gucci Mane, Lil Wayne and Quavo were among the performers. In 2019, ahead of Super Bowl LIII, the venue held a three-day festival with Bruno Mars, Ludacris and Aerosmith as headliners. The series of shows earned more than $10 million in revenue and resulted in more than 38,000 tickets sold, according to venue sources from the time.



The arena is adjacent to Mercedes-Benz Stadium and other major developments under construction in downtown, such as Centennial Yards and South Downtown. This presents opportunities, Saltzman said.

“The learnings are: this works and makes sense. That's why we're investing in this opportunity and will continue to as mega events come in,” Saltzman said.

Now, it's a matter of finding the right entertainment options that appeal to a broad amount of people, Saltzman said. The countries represented in the eight matches won't be determined until September.

“What we've realized is when guests are coming to town, it's critical that they're entertained,” Saltzman said. “Music is that common thread.”

The United States Men's National Team faces a crucial test this summer in the Concacaf Gold Cup. It's North America's biennial international tournament that will serve as the USMNT's last competitive preparation for the 2026 World Cup, which will be played in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

The USMNT has a checkered history in the Gold Cup, winning the title seven times (most recently in 2021) but failing to reach the final in 2023 after falling to Panama in the semifinals. (Sound familiar?) 

With the World Cup a little more than a year away (June 11-July 19, 2026), the Gold Cup stands as the biggest and best remaining test of the USMNT's tournament readiness. If it does well, the USMNT will enter the World Cup on a positive trajectory. If the Americans struggle, they will crash into the tournament in a state of chaos.

USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino recently talked with U. S. Soccer about how he's preparing for Gold Cup. Here are the four biggest takeaways from the discussion:

He isn't underestimating his group

The USMNT will face Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia and Haiti in the group stage of the Gold Cup. Only two of those teams will move on to the knockout stage — and while the USMNT is widely expected to be one of them, Pochettino isn't taking anything for granted.

"It's important that we respect all of our opponents in the competition," he said. "The Gold Cup is historically always a difficult competition."

That's a good mindset to have. Trinidad and Tobago eliminated the USMNT from World Cup contention in 2017, Saudi Arabia beat eventual champion Argentina in the group stage of the 2022 World Cup and Haiti is unbeaten in its last 10 fixtures. They're all capable of delivering upsets and surprises.

He's keeping an eye on character

For Pochettino, competitiveness isn't just about on-field talent. It's also about off-field attitude.

"The mentality of the players is really important," he said. "We need to be intelligent in the way that we are going to select the players and not just choose based on talent alone."

In practice, that means up-and-coming, high-energy players might get Gold Cup minutes over traditional USMNT starters. Keep an eye on big-hearted characters such as Real Salt Lake's Diego Luna, Olympique Lyonnais' Tanner Tessman and the Vancouver Whitecaps' Brian White. They might play a bigger role in the Gold Cup than previously expected.

He has a grip on the global USMNT playing pool, but his takes on it might be controversial

It has taken time, but Pochettino and his team appear to have a good handle on where the best American soccer players are around the globe, from Milan to Monterrey and everywhere in between. 

"For sure we have a better picture," he said of the USMNT landscape. "Since we took over the project we wanted to identify and scout as many players as possible, both in MLS and those playing abroad."

Pochettino's recent lineups have taught us plenty about what that picture looks like. He's more positive about Major League Soccer and its players than many predicted he would be, but he's less high on the English Championship and Liga MX than his predecessors. He has passed over Middlesbrough's Aidan Morris, Coventry City's Haji Wright and Club America's Alex Zendejas in recent windows.

He's still high on 'intensity,' but he's not talking much about what it means

If there's one buzzword for the Pochettino era, it's "intensity"— the Argentine is adamant about cultivating it, protecting it and delivering it since he took over the team last fall. Intensity, unsurprisingly, is back on the menu for the Gold Cup. 

"For sure to start we must compete hard," Pochettino said of the tournament. "We must match the intensity of our opponents, because in these tournaments, they are always motivated to play against the USA."

But what does Pochettino mean when he says "intensity"? Is it energy? Physicality? Dedication? Mental fortitude? We've never really found out. 

Pochettino is tight-lipped about how he defines and measures it for his players. But whatever intensity means to Pochettino, the USMNT hasn't provided it yet.

The USMNT will return to action in early June with friendly matches against Turkey and Switzerland. It will open its Gold Cup campaign on June 15 against Trinidad and Tobago in San Jose, California.

The Club World Cup will be televised live on Channel 5 this summer after the free-to-air broadcaster reached a sublicensing agreement for the UK with the global rights holder, Dazn.

The Guardian can reveal that as part of a cross-promotional deal finalised this week, 23 of the 63 matches will be shown on Channel 5 as well as on Dazn – 15 group games, four last-16 ties, two quarter-finals, one semi-final and the final. The remaining 40 games will be shown exclusively by Dazn, which has committed to making every match in the new expanded tournament available free-to-air globally via its app.

The Club World Cup, which includes Chelsea and Manchester City, will be the highest-profile sports event televised by Channel 5, which has held live rights to the Europa League and numerous highlights packages. Channel 5 is also in talks with the England and Wales Cricket Board about buying two men's and two women's England T20 matches this summer as it seeks to expand its sports coverage. It is owned by the American film giant Paramount.

Dazn paid $1bn (£787m) for global Club World Cup rights in February in a surprise deal that appears to have been largely funded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, with the kingdom's Surj Sports Investment group last month confirming it had taken a minority stake in the streaming company valued at $1bn. Fifa subsequently announced the prize and appearance fund would also be $1bn, with the tournament winners to receive up to $125.8m depending on their results and Chelsea and City to bank $38.19m for qualifying.

The Dazn/Surj partnership spared Fifa's blushes after a lengthy TV rights sales process which had concluded with it failing to find rights partners. Apple TV withdrew from advanced negotiations over a global deal last summer after a disagreement over valuation, with Fifa reportedly demanding $4bn, and a subsequent attempt to sell the rights on a regional basis foundered.

Although Dazn's latest accounts say it has 300 million monthly users globally, it remains a challenger company in certain markets, including the UK, which led to an agreement to sublicense the rights to ensure larger viewing figures for Fifa and its commercial partners. Warner Bros has a sublicensing deal in the United States.

The Guardian reported this month that the BBC and ITV had opted not to bid because their main football focus will be their joint coverage of England's defence of the Women's European Championship. Channel 5 beat Channel 4 to an agreement with Dazn, the deal brokered by Lee Sears, Paramount's president of international ad sales.

“We're delighted to be able to have agreed this fantastic partnership with Dazn to expand free-to-air coverage of the Fifa Club World Cup, live on 5,” Sears told the Guardian. “It's going to be one of the sporting events of the summer with most of the matches played in the evening peak time and 32 of the world's biggest clubs involved.” Sears said the ambition was to offer viewers and advertisers “even more [sport] in the months to come”.

Channel 5 will take Dazn's coverage and promote Dazn's brand rather than use its own staff. Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich and Lionel Messi's Inter Miami are among the participants in the competition, which runs from 14 June to 13 July.

United States men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino has made it clear that mental fortitude will be a major factor in his player selection for the upcoming Gold Cup, where the team will face Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia, and Haiti in group stage competition.

In an interview released Tuesday by the U.S. Soccer Federation, Pochettino stressed that talent alone would not guarantee players a spot on the roster as he looks to rebuild following disappointing performances in the recent Nations League Finals.

"The right mindset must be there, because we need to compete for our flag, our country," Pochettino said. "We need to be intelligent in the way that we are going to select the players and not just choose based on talent alone. We need to have the right characters to be really competitive."

The USMNT suffered an unexpected setback in the Nations League last month, falling 1-0 to Panama in the semifinals before losing 2-1 to Canada in the third-place match. These defeats marked the first time the United States failed to win the tournament after claiming victory in its first three editions.

Following those losses, Pochettino publicly criticized his team's competitive spirit and effort levels, concerns he continues to emphasize ahead of the Gold Cup competition.

The former Tottenham and PSG manager has highlighted the need for players to understand their responsibility as national team representatives, particularly when opponents are highly motivated to face the United States.

"For sure to start we must compete hard," Pochettino explained. "We must match the intensity of our opponents, because in these tournaments they are always motivated to play against the USA."

Pochettino previously drew comparisons to Argentina's mentality in discussions with ESPN, suggesting the world champions' warrior mindset as a model for his American squad: "They [Argentina] go to war and to defend your badge, your flag, and that is what we need to create."

Before the Gold Cup tournament begins, the USMNT will return to action with two international friendlies, hosting Turkey on June 7 and Switzerland on June 10, providing Pochettino additional opportunities to evaluate potential squad members.

"It's not just about showing up in your home country and trying to play nice soccer. No, you must be proud, you must fight for the people that would love to be in your position, for the millions of kids that are going to see us and dream to be one day where we are," Pochettino emphasized.

"This is the type of responsibility and commitment we need to show in a different way than we did in Los Angeles."

US women's soccer legend Alex Morgan has shared heartwarming family photos of her newborn son, Enzo, following his birth last month.

Morgan and her husband, fellow soccer player Servando Carrasco, welcomed their daughter, Charlie, in 2020.

And their family recently expanded with the birth of baby boy Enzo, who can be seen with his big sister and parents in adorable new beach photos released by design marketplace Minted.

In one picture, Morgan can be seen holding up Enzo to her nose, while the family can be seen laughing in another as both parents carry their children.

In another sweet shot, Morgan can be seen sitting in the sand as she and her family look at the camera.

Morgan announced the birth of Enzo on March 31, as she and Carrasco jointly posted a picture of his feet to their Instagram accounts.

'Soaking it all up right now. Welcome to the world baby Enzo,' the post was captioned.

Morgan, the fifth-highest scorer in US women's national team history, announced her retirement from professional soccer in September.

Prior to her final game with the San Diego Wave, the striker walked onto the field with daughter Charlie in an emotional scene.

She was also brought flowers by her daughter after the game.

Morgan won two World Cups and one Olympic gold medal with the national team, for whom she appeared 224 times and scored 123 goals.

In a video announcing her retirement, Morgan said she had 'clarity' on the decision.

'It has been a long time coming, and this decision wasn't easy, but at the beginning of 2024, I felt in my heart and soul that this was the last season that I would play soccer,' she said.

'The impact we have on the next generation is irreversible, and I am proud of the hand I had in making that happen, pushing the game forward, and leaving it in a place that I am so happy and proud of.”

An estimated 6.5 billion sets of international eyes will be on Atlanta in the summer of 2026, as viewers around the world don their team jerseys and watch the highly anticipated FIFA World Cup.

And with eight matches in Atlanta — including a coveted semifinal game — 300,000 more people are expected to flock to Georgia's capital to enjoy events at Mercedes-Benz Stadium and across the metro area.

The pressure is on for elected officials to show off the best version of the city without spotlighting issues that plague everyday residents, like Atlanta's traffic congestion or infrastructure problems. The tournament, with matches in both June and July next year, is arguably the biggest of many large-scale events the city has hosted in the past three decades.

“The idea here is that we reintroduce the world to Atlanta,” said Norelie Garcia, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens' chief executive officer overseeing the city's marketing of the event. “A lot of people's perception of Atlanta is from the 1996 Olympics, and so much has changed.”

Although there's still more than a year beforekickoff, elected officials have already started tackling crucial planning issues like how best to bolster public safety downtown, what transit options visitors have to get around the city and the best way for Atlanta's businesses to benefit from the huge influx of cash.

The Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce recently estimated that out-of-state visitors will bring in  about $500 million — but Dickens said Wednesday he hopes the number to be more than $1 billion, if the city can persuade visitors to stay a day or two longer.

“If they just spend an extra day or two in our region — they've got to have a hotel, they have to spend money on food — it doubles the money, almost,” he said. “All these visitors are going to fill hotels, not just in Atlanta, but in cities across the county, spreading the economic benefits throughout this whole region.”

“And I know that we will all be ready,” he added.

The first-term mayor running for reelection this year made his comments to a room full of elected officials from 15 cities across Fulton County, all of whom hope to benefit from the tournament as much as Georgia's capital city.

“This is more than just a game,” Union City Mayor Vince Williams said. “The World Cup represents global unity, resilience and the power of sport to bring together people of every background, belief and border. And I can think of no better region to host such a momentous event than ours — diverse, dynamic and deeply rooted in community.”

Atlanta is no stranger to courting and hosting major events. Last year, the presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden fell on the same day as the Copa America game between the U.S. and Panama — the events less than 3 miles away from each other. The city has also played host to Super Bowls, college football and basketball championship games, and more.

But Atlanta also faces a lengthy to-do list ahead of the World Cup matches: a $120 million downtown makeover that includes 25 miles of street resurfacing, restriping 200 intersections, installing 150 new streetlights and 14 miles of sidewalk repairs, including additional Americans with Disabilities Act accessibility improvements — all on a tight two-year timeline.

Officials are also expecting a majority of the city's iconic Beltline to be completed by summer 2026. Beltline officials said when the games come to town, nearly 16.3 miles of the main trail and 1.6 miles of the Westside Connector — which provides a pedestrian path from Washington Park directly to Mercedes-Benz Stadium — will be open to visitors.

Even Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport's new $530 million South parking deck, with about 7,700 spaces, is scheduled to open in time for World Cup matches. Airport officials recently announced a significant parking price hike to fund its major expansion projects.

And despite success in lowering crime across the city in the past four years, the massive event also brings its own security threats both inside and outside the stadium. The Dickens administration will lean on a newly created division within the Atlanta Police Department to prepare for potential disruptions.

“Everybody coming here won't have a ticket, but everybody's coming for the fun, the excitement, the energy,” Atlanta Chief Operating Officer LaChandra Burks sai. “What our public safety team often tells us, if we are not prepared for the people who are coming without a ticket, a lot of different things can happen.”

Atlanta has the second-highest number of FIFA World Cup matches in the country — behind only Dallas, which is slated to host nine games. Dan Corso, president of the Atlanta Sports Council, said the city tried to make the case to host the final, but Mercedes-Benz Stadium capacity didn't quite reach FIFA's 80,000-seat requirement.

“But that doesn't mean that the event is just downtown,” Corso said. “Everybody who has an opportunity to be a part of the World Cup — it may not be directly involved with the matches downtown — but your citizens and residents can be a part of your experience.”

FIFA Club World Cup

The Club World Cup will be broadcast on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom following a sublicensing deal with DAZN, the global rights holder for the tournament.

The free-to-air channel will show 23 of the newly-expanded tournament's 63 matches live: 15 group games, four last-16 matches, two quarter-final games, one semi-final and the final.

All 63 matches will be broadcast for free on the online platform of DAZN, who struck a deal worth $1billion (£750million) deal with FIFA in December for the global rights.

Premier League clubs Manchester City and Chelsea will be involved in the 32-team tournament, alongside Real Madrid, Inter, Juventus, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain.

World football's governing body had been in talks with Apple over a global streaming deal to broadcast the tournament, but those negotiations fell through in July 2024.

Channel 5 is owned by Paramount Global, whose president of international ad sales Lee Sears described the competition as “one of the sporting events of the summer” with matches played “in peak evening time” in the UK.

DAZN's CEO Shay Segev added “the Club World Cup will bring unparalleled engagement opportunities”.

The Club World Cup begins on June 14 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami and will run until July 13, with the final taking place at MetLife Stadium in New York.

Channel 5 was most widely known among football fans for showing UEFA Cup matches from the channel's inception in 1997 until 2012, when it lost the rights to free-to-air commercial rival ITV Sport.

There is still over a month left of the La Liga season for Real Madrid, where they are still hopeful they can beat rivals Barcelona to the title. After the season concludes, players will not head to sunny destinations to relax; they will head to the United States to compete in the FIFA Club World Cup.

Los Blancos will participate in the 32-team tournament, with their first game on June 18. They face three opponents in the group stage, and if they progress into the knockout stages, they will play in July.

This is a problem for two Los Blancos players whose contracts expire at the end of June. Luka Modric and Lucas Vázquez are the players in question, and according to Diario AS, the club has extended their contract until the end of July, covering them until after the final if they make it that far.

It's excellent news for the two players, but they are uncertain whether they will be at the club for the 2025-26 season. 

Reports have suggested that Vázquez will not be offered a new deal, and the 33-year-old must look for a new club. The jury is still out on Modric, who performed well when called upon. Seen as a good squad member, he may be offered another year, something he is hopeful of getting.

In the same article, it was said that David Alaba and Fran Garcia, whose contracts expire in 2026, are potential departures in the summer. The former is the more likely to stay at the club until the end of his contract.

The Club World Cup is set to be broadcast on free-to-air Channel 5 in the UK this summer after they reached an agreement with global rights holder DAZN.

The broadcaster will show 23 of the tournament's 63 matches live, including four last-16 ties, two quarter-finals, one semi-final and the final as well as 15 group games.

The matches will also be shown on DAZN, who will exclusively televise the other 40 fixtures after they agreed a £787million deal with FIFA for rights for the tournament.

Channel 5 has previously held the rights to the Europa League, showing it live from 1997 until 2012.

But the deal with DAZN for the Club World Cup, reported by The Guardian, is one of the highest profile sporting events it has acquired.

The new expanded 32-team competition features Manchester City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain, Inter Milan and Juventus.DAZN has said it will make every game available to watch for free worldwide on its app.

The Club World Cup is set to be broadcast on free-to-air Channel 5 in the UK this summer 

The British streaming platform struck a deal with FIFA, who had previously struggled to find a broadcaster, in December.

Just three months earlier president Gianni Infantino held an emergency meeting to try and drum up interest. 

DAZN's deal appears to be partly propped up by funding from Saudi Arabia.

Indeed, a minority stake was sold to SURJ Sports Investment, a company operating as part of the Saudi Public Investment Fund, in February. 

ITV reportedly made a cheeky £0 bid to broadcast the Club World Cup last summer - before the DAZN package.

The terrestrial TV giant looked to convince the governing body to give them the rights free of charge if it agreed to screen games during the new-look, expanded tournament on their main channels.

ITV initially entered the race, believing their offer to invest in production costs and screen games to a wider audience may have been enough to tempt FIFA. 

The tournament will run from mid-June until July 13 and games will be played across the US, including in Charlotte, Cincinnati and Los Angeles.

Chelsea and Manchester City will compete in it after winning the Champions League 

Clubs will able to earn up to £97m in prize money if they win all of their group-stage games and then the tournament itself. Chelsea and Manchester City will compete in it as a result of winning the Champions League in 2021 and 2023 respectively.

Clubs from other continents that have qualified include Boca Juniors, River Plate and Al-Hilal.  

The only team from CONCACAF, the north American division, will be Lionel Messi's Inter Miami, while Infantino called it the 'the most widely accessible club football tournament ever'.

The competition had originally received criticism from clubs and players for adding more games to a cramped calendar.

Global players's union Fifpro and the European Leagues body filed a complaint to the European Commission last year to protest FIFA's 'abuse of dominance' in the game.

According the tournament regulations published by FIFA, clubs must field their strongest teams for all games.

There's a buzz in the air around Kansas City about FIFA World Cup 26, including at Westport Tattoo.

“To have something like that come to Kansas City, with being a big soccer fan all my life and all those world teams coming here, it's just great," said soccer fan Gabe Wilkerson. 

Wilkerson — who was getting work done on his right-arm sleeve Tuesday afternoon at Westport Tattoo, 1509 Westport Road in Kansas City, Missouri — wants to take his family to at least one of the six games GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium will host during next summer's World Cup.

Assuming, of course, he can afford it.

On Location, which is handling the premium hospitality tickets for World Cup games in Kansas City, recently released the price for its high-end offerings, which range from $1,225 to $3,000 per ticket for group-stage games.

But don't panic.

“Tickets for the FIFA World Cup 2026™ will be sold exclusively via FIFA.com/tickets, with general sales expected to begin in late 2025,” KC2026 CEO Pam Kramer said. “These tickets, which will be available to the general public, differ from the premium tickets currently being sold for FIFA's hospitality deposit program, On Location.”

They also should be cheaper — significantly cheaper — in most cases, but it still may take some familial financial planning.

“It definitely seems like a lot of those bigger sporting events are pretty expensive,” said Westport Tattoo owner Tim Johnson.

Johnson is also a soccer enthusiast and hopes his family gets to experience the World Cup in person next year.

“Whenever I heard it was coming, I wanted to go,” said Johnson, who said he and his family love attending live sporting events. “I told my son about it, and he wants to go as well.”

It seems like everyone wants to check out what all the fuss is about.

“I don't even care who's playing,” said Sarah Clark, a fellow soccer fan and tattoo artist at Westport Tattoo. “It would just be cool to go see the experience, get to meet people from all over the place and all that kind of stuff.”

As a kid, Clark played goalkeeper, and her family has always loved soccer. She remembers attending Wizards games at Arrowhead in front of sparse crowds.

“I would imagine we're gonna have a few more people involved and a few more excited fans than we did back in the '90s,” Clark said.

Wilkerson and Johnson said they'd be willing to spend $200 to $500 per ticket to attend a World Cup game. Clark said she's hoping to find tickets closer to the $150 to $200 range, so they aren't the target audience for On Location's packages.

“For the average Joe, I would imagine that's not within reach,” Clark said. “I, myself, would definitely not be able to afford that.”

Johnson said he's paid as much as $800 for floor seats to a UFC fight before, but he's worried about the dent four tickets in that price range might put in his budget.

“If it's a big event — like a life event, where you may not be able to do it again — $200 to $500-ish wouldn't be out of the range per ticket,” Johnson said.

Still, the price tag for the upper-end of ticketing options gave the crew at Westport Tattoo hope.

“That sounds pretty reasonable for some people,” Wilkerson said. “It's more than I would probably pay to do it, but that doesn't sound like it's outlandish at all.”

He feared it might cost $1,000 or more for any ticket to a World Cup game, but now he's hopeful general ticket sales — which will start in the third quarter of 2025, according to FIFA — should be closer to his family's price range.

Fans seeking priority access to World Cup ticket-included hospitality experiences can place a deposit with On Location.

The rest of us have to wait a few more months for a chance to snag a once-in-a-lifetime ticket.

“FIFA encourages any fan wishing to purchase tickets for the FIFA World Cup 2026™ to be wary of non-FIFA official ticketing websites that claim to be selling tickets already and only purchase tickets from the official and legitimate source once those are made available,” FIFA said in an email to KSHB 41 News via KC2026.

Fans can sign up for email updates at the FIFA ticketing website.

The FIFA Club World Cup is an international men's association football competition organised by the sport's global governing body that pits the best teams from every continent against one another.

Having been held every year since 2005, the new format is to be held every four years, taking place in the summer the year the World Cup.

FIFA have rejigged the whole competition so instead of just seven participants and a straight knockout, where European and South American sides entered in the semi-finals, this format mirrors that of the World Cup.

32 teams will take part, with 12 of those being from Europe. Winners of the Champions League in the four years leading up to the Club World Cup all qualify, as do the other top ranked teams in UEFA's 4-year rankings. 

It's the same qualification format for teams across other continents too, with victory in the Copa Libertadores, Asian Champions League, African Champions League and CONCACAF Champions League clinching a place in the CWC.

There is one 'host' team that is selected for every Club World Cup, and in 2025 that is Inter Miami.

The 32 teams will be split into eight groups of four, and after a round robin, two sides from each group progress to the knockout stages.

The 2025 Club World Cup will be held in the USA, one of the host countries for the 2026 World Cup.

Games will take place across 12 stadiums in 11 cities featuring Philadelphia, Atlanta, Miami, Orlando and East Rutherford.

The tournament takes place from June 15th until July 13th, with the first game seeing 'host' team Inter Miami face Egyptian side Al Ahly in Miami.

The final takes place on July 13th at MetLife Stadium in New York, kicking off at 8pm BST.

The 2025 Club World Cup winners will take home a huge £97m from FIFA.

A prize pot of £774m is to be shared between the 32 sides. £406m of that will be shared according to sporting and commercial criteria, and the rest distributed based on sporting performance.



32 teams have qualified for the tournament, split by confederation:

However, at the time of writing only 31 teams have been confirmed after Mexican side Club Leon were removed from the Club World Cup after failing to meet criteria on multi-club ownership, with both they and CF Pachuca owned by the same corporation.

Their replacement is yet to be announced, though Leon were set to be in the same group as Chelsea, so the Blues will have to wait a little longer to see who their final opponent will be.

The aforementioned Chelsea qualified thanks to their Champions League win in 20/21, and they join reigning Club World Cup champions Manchester City as the only two English sides to participate.



Record winners of the Champions League, Real Madrid, are the early favourites to win the first revamped version of Club World Cup.

Reigning CWC champions Manchester City follow ahead of Bayern Munich, before a big drop to Chelsea, Inter, PSG and Atletico Madrid.

The first non-European side in the betting is Brazilian side Palmeiras, while the first non-European and non-South American side is Saudi Pro League's Al-Hilal.

Hosts Inter Miami, led by Lionel Messi, are 33/1.



The opening match will be staged in Munich on June 14 between Germany and Scotland.

Didac Aguirre

The topic of the bench for the white team still remains one of the most talked about in the press and social media. This is because it is not known if Ancelotti is the one who will continue on the bench until the end of the season or even in the Club World Cup. However, the most recent information suggests that this will not be the case and that there will be a substitute in the meantime.

Everything points to the fact that, unlike what some believe, someone completely new will not arrive but Santiago Solari. The former coach of the white team has already been notified to be the one to lead the Club World Cup in the United States in the summer. This, from the board's point of view, is the most natural situation they can see today at least for the moment.

That said, this may be subject to a radical change if the new coach wants to get involved very early. Only in this case would Solari's position be taken over by this new coach, but for now, it is the decision made by the board.

The Argentine already had the opportunity to lead the white team in a transition just before Zidane's second round. His performance was not the most optimal, but he left great things like the incorporation of Vinicius and Valverde into the first team.

Now he could be the main option to lead in the Club World Cup if Ancelotti ends up leaving as expected at the end of the Cup. A decision which for many is wrong, but today, without having a new coach signed, it is the most optimal.

For now, the only thing we can do is wait and see if the information about Ancelotti's departure after that Copa del Rey final really comes true. Only then will we be able to see what the board's move will be and if this is really the path to follow. However, before this, it seems very complicated to determine what the higher-ups are thinking.

Teenage sensation Joao Fonseca has taken the tennis world by storm this season. The Brazilian took out a top-10 seed on his Grand Slam debut and followed it up by winning his first title in Buenos Aires. Now, he's eyeing a showdown with Novak Djokovic.

The world No. 65 has already put himself on Djokovic's radar. The 24-time Grand Slam champion has lauded praise on Fonseca and his rise. But, while other up-and-comers would rather avoid Djokovic at the biggest tournaments, Fonseca is all-in on a blockbuster first-round meeting at the French Open.

Fonseca enjoys a challenge. The 18-year-old qualified for his first Grand Slam main draw at the Australian Open back in January and stunned No. 9 seed Andrey Rublev in straight sets.

A few weeks later, Fonseca claimed his first ATP Tour title at the Argentina Open, and he's also collected two Challenger trophies this season.

The Brazilian hit a career-high ranking of No. 59 earlier this year and now sits at No. 65, meaning he can claim direct entry into the Grand Slam tournaments, including next month's French Open.

Fonseca is hoping for another huge test in his next Major appearance, facing Djokovic. The teenager grew up watching the Serb dominate the sport, and he now enters every tournament hoping they will meet in the first round.

“When we start these biggest tournaments, the Grand Slams, the qualies, I always tell my coach, ‘If I go to the main draw, I want to play Djokovic', because it's probably one of the last times. I hope I can play him,” he told Roland Garros.

“I'd love to face Djokovic first, second round. I'd try to play my best tennis, the result wouldn't matter, I'd just enjoy it.”

Djokovic has 24 Major trophies under his belt, three of which came at the French Open, and plenty of players wouldn't want to face him early in one of the biggest tournaments. But Fonseca thrives against top opponents.

He added: “I like to play the top seeds, I like the challenge. I play with no pressure, so I think I can play well there.

“I like to play with the crowd also, so it's an experience I want to have. Some players will want to play ‘easier' first, but I want to play the iconic ones.”

Djokovic would also likely relish a chance to play the 18-year-old while their paths can still cross. During last month's Miami Open, the tennis legend admitted he'd been impressed with Fonseca.

“He's been [the] talk of the tour in the last several months. I mean, deservedly so,” Djokovic said.

“He's a very good tennis player. I mean, so young. Just incredible firepower from both ends of the baseline, serve. He's a very complete player.”

Before he can think about the French Open, Fonseca is currently getting some reps in on the clay at the Madrid Open. He faces another young star, qualifier Elmer Moller, in the first round on Thursday.

16 first round matches are scheduled on Day 2 of the ATP Mutua Madrid Open. Lots of exciting matches to look forward to for the fans including the match between Nicolas Jarry and Daniel Altmaier. As always, we at LWOT will offer predictions for every match on the slate, but who will advance?

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Mattia Bellucci is sitting at his career-high ranking and any match wins this week will only improve his rankings. He is playing in Madrid for the first time and will like his chances to make a winning start. Damir Dzumhur is an experienced campaigner and has been in good form recently. Dzumhur made the semifinals in Bucharest and then did well to qualify for the main draw of Barcelona Open. Both players are extremely close in rankings and I expect a tight contest.
Prediction: Dzumhur in 3

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Quentin Halys will play his first match on clay this season and has to go through a tough first-round match. Halys is not known for his game on clay but the quicker conditions in Madrid should help his big serve. However, I still like Luciano Darderi's chances better in this match as he is the more natural on this surface and has played some fantastic tennis in the last month. If the Italian player can get into enough rallies, he will be the favourite to win.
Prediction: Darderi in 3

Head-to-Head:

Zizou Bergs is enjoying the best season of his career and has been super consistent. He has only played 19 main draw matches on clay but his game style is well suited for the surface. Yoshihito Nishioka will play his first match on ckay this season and would be the heavy underdog going into this match. The Japanese prefers to play on hard courts and Bergs should be able to trouble him with heavy top spin. Nishioka's serve will also be under pressure all match. All in all, I like Bergs to win this match comfortably.
Prediction: Bergs in 2

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Nicolas Jarry has the perfect game to exploit the conditions of the Madrid Masters, but surprisingly he has only one win here in two main draw appearances. Jarry is going through a rough patch since the French Open last year and is on a five match losing streak. However, he has shown some glimpses of better tennis recently and will look to play a solid match. Daniel Altmaier has a good record here and is a former quarterfinalist. Altmaier has done a lot of winning this year including the two wins in qualifying. If Jarry plays at his best he can win this but his form can't be trusted.
Prediction: Altmaier in 3

The clay court season is well underway with the ATP Madrid Masters 1000 tournament rolling into Day 2. There are a lot of matches scheduled for Thursday and it promises to be an exciting day of tennis. As ever, we at LWOT preview and predict the matches scheduled for you.

Head-to-head – First Meeting

Both players enter this tournament with little confidence on the clay courts as neither managed to win consecutive matches on the trot this year on clay. Marcos Giron is higher ranked and he would feel good about his chances against Learner Tien who will find it tough to hit through on the slow courts in Madrid. Expect Giron to be more aggressive and get the win.
Prediction: Giron in 3

Head-to-head – First Meeting

It will be interesting to see how well Tallon Griekspoor plays this week as he has built good momentum on the clay courts this year. He now faces Vit Kopriva who hasn't played much on the main tour and will find it tough to go toe to toe with the quality of Griekspoor.
Prediction: Griekspoor in 2

Tomas Martin Etcheverry hasn't had the European clay court swing he would have liked so far and his first round this week is a tricky one. He takes on Hamad Medjedovic who has had good results in the past month or so and the young Serb will look to capitalise on that. Expect a tight match with the Serb winning with his assured attacking game style.
Prediction: Medjedovic in 3

Head-to-head – Struff 1-1 Zandschulp

Jan-Lennard Struff has had a disastrous 2025 season so far and the clay court season hasn't been kind to him either. The German now faces Botic van de Zandschulp, who is building up some momentum having reached the Round of 16 in Munich last week. The Dutchman will look to take full toll of Struff's lack of confidence and the clay courts will enable Zandschulp to do so.
Prediction: van de Zandschulp in 3

Most fans have come to know Fonseca by now. What about Moller? The Dane is just three years older than the Brazilian phenom, and has also been on a winning run. Most recently, the 21-year-old took out three of the top four seeds at the ATP Challenger Tour event in Oeiras en route to the title. It was his second career title on the circuit, and with it he jumped 34 spots to a career-high No. 114 in the rankings.Fonseca, who has also won a Challenger title this season—at the loaded Phoenix event, filled with early departures from Indian Wells—is just off his career-high No. 59, and this could be the last clay-court swing he's unseeded for decades.

In a new Netflix documentary, "Carlos Alcaraz: My Way", the Spaniard describes how he went against the advice of his team to let his hair down on the Mediterranean island.

"I had a friend who had a few days off, going to Ibiza with other friends," the now four-time Grand Slam champion said.

"I ended up going and they know what I'm going there to do. In Ibiza, I'm not going to lie, it's pretty much all about partying and going out.

"I basically went there to reventar (literally, 'burst' in Spanish), I'm not sure if that's the best way to put it but I went there to go out."

It might not have been textbook preparation for Wimbledon, and his agent Albert Molina warned against it, but Alcaraz said he had to let off steam after losing to Novak Djokovic in the 2023 French Open semis having suffered with nerves and cramps.

Ibiza's tonic paid off spectacularly too, as a few weeks later, aged 20, he beat the Serb in the Wimbledon final.

"I tried to explain to him that it might not be the best idea to go to Ibiza for three or four days on vacation when he had Queen's the following week and then Wimbledon," Molina said.

Alcaraz repeated the trick in 2024 with another Ibiza trip before the grass-court season with his fitness coach Juanjo Moreno accusing him of being selfish.

In the documentary his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero even questions whether Alcaraz has the dedication required to emulate the likes of Djokovic and Rafael Nadal.

"He has a different way of understanding work and sacrifice," Ferrero said, comparing him to Djokovic. "It's so different that it makes me question whether he can really be the best in history."

But Alcaraz has no regrets.

"They always want to protect me, but I'm getting older, I'm starting to make my own decisions and that's what I want," he said. "I don't take care of myself as much, I spend a lot of days enjoying life. Maybe more than I should.

"But I want to do it my way."

Alcaraz, who will be 22 next month, is second seed at this week's Madrid Masters.

Aryna Sabalenka and Carlos Alcaraz will both be hoping to get their hands on the Madrid Open title again.

Sabalenka lost to Jelena Ostapenko last week in the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix final, as she finished runner-up in Stuttgart for a fourth time.

The world number one was not the only player that finished just short of a title last week, with Alcaraz losing the Barcelona Open final to Holger Rune.

Alcaraz suffered an injury scare in Barcelona, leaving his participation at the 2025 Madrid Open is now in doubt.

Now Sabalenka has taken a different stance to Alcaraz on Masters 1000 tournaments like the Madrid Open.

Last week en route to Barcelona Open final, Alcaraz was asked about two Masters 1000 tournaments.

The week prior Alcaraz had won the Monte Carlo Masters, which took place over just one week, something that is becoming more of a rarity on both the ATP and WTA Tours.

When asked about the differing tournaments, Alcaraz claimed that the one week tournaments are much better for players, “The one week ones are better. Some will think that in two weeks there are days of rest, but that is not the case.

“You train, you have to mentally prepare for the game, prepare for it… you're not resting, really. It's two full weeks. That's why I prefer the one-week Masters 1000. For me, it's better for tennis.”

Suggesting that they may have different approaches to these events, Sabalenka has now given her verdict on these tournaments and revealed that she actually  prefers two week tournaments.

“I prefer two-week tournaments because having a day off between matches allows you to relax more, go out to dinner with your team, and explore the city,” Sabalenka said in her pre-Madrid Open press conference. 

“Maybe in a few years I won't be so interested in that and prefer to spend more time at home, but right now, that's my mentality.”

While Sabalenka is currently in favor of them, Alcaraz is not on his own in people who have criticised two week Masters 1000 tournaments.

Despite Alcaraz's plea, two week Masters 1000 tournaments are becoming more and more frequent.

Seven out of the nine ATP Masters 1000 tournaments will take place over 12 days in 2025, with the Canadian Open and the Cincinnati Open also being extended this year.

This leaves just the Monte Carlo Masters and the Paris Masters as the remaining one week events, while the WTA Tour just has the Dubai Tennis Championships, Qatar Open and the Wuhan Open.

The current Masters 1000 tournament is the Madrid Open, where both Alcaraz and Sabalenka are two-time champions.

Former tennis world No 1 Andre Agassi will make his professional debut in the fast-growing sport of pickelball next week when he teams up with top ranked Anna Leigh Waters for the mixed doubles at the US Open Pickleball Championships.

Invented in 1965 by a group of American friends, pickleball is a fast-paced paddle sport similar to tennis and badminton played on smaller courts using a perforated plastic ball, and interest has skyrocketed in recent years.

Waters, 18, is the Professional Pickleball Association's top-ranked player in the world for singles, doubles and mixed doubles and Agassi said he would probably weigh her down.

“She's probably sick of winning so much, and that's why she called me and asked me to play,” Agassi, who won eight tennis grand slams among his 60 ATP Tour-level titles, told CNBC on Tuesday.

The 54-year-old added that he did not see him joining the growing ranks of pro pickeball players after the tournament, which takes place in Naples, Florida.

“If I had the luxury of bandwidth to focus all my energy on just playing and body recovery and all that stuff, that would be a joy. But I don't. I'm in a different season now,” he said.

Tennis legend Andre Agassi will make his pro pickleball debut at the US Open Championships in Naples. The tournament is set to run from April 26-May 3 at East Naples Community Park.

Agassi, a former world No. 1-ranked tennis player and winner of the sport's Grand Slam, will partner with Anna Leigh Waters, the top-ranked women's player in singles, doubles and mixed doubles.

Here is more to know about Andre Agassi, one of the most iconic tennis players in the sport's history.

Agassi was born on April 29, 1970 in Las Vegas, which means he is 54 years old. His father Mike Agassi, an Iranian immigrant, was determined his son would be a successful tennis player.

When he was 13, Agassi started training at Nick Bollettieri's tennis academy in Bradenton. He made his professional debut as a 16-year-old in 1986 and won his first major in 1992 when he defeated Groan Ivanisevic at Wimbledon.

Agassi has been married to former women's tennis great Steffi Graf since 2001. The tennis power couple first met following Agassi's Wimbledon victory in 1992. They have two children: Jaden Gil Agassi, age 23, and Jaz Elle Agassi, 21.

Agassi was previously married to actress Brooke Shields from 1995 to 1997.

The 18-year-old Waters, Agassi's playing partner at the US Open Pickleball Championships in Naples, turned pro as a 12-year-old in 2019, becoming the youngest pickleball champion in the sport's history.

Waters, who lives in Boynton Beach, has since won 148 gold medals and earned an estimated $3 million per year from endorsements and sponsorships in 2024, according to Forbes, making her the highest-paid pickleball player in the world.

The city of Abidjan bustles with more than six million people. Energy can be felt through its streets and the city's size is impossible to ignore. Now that same vibrancy is intersecting with tennis as the Côte d'Ivoire becomes the 95th country to host an ATP Challenger Tour event.


Dubbed by some as the ‘Paris of West Africa', Abidjan is in the middle of hosting back-to-back weeks of Challenger 50 tournaments, concluding this Sunday. It marks another step forward for tennis in Africa, following Rwanda's debut last season and its second edition earlier this year. Brazzaville, Republic of Congo has also hosted this year and in 2024.


Now, the Ivorian locals are excited to welcome professional tennis to their homeland.


“The spectators are crazy around the court, very enthusiastic with the competition, so that's great. It doesn't look like a tennis match, more so football because tennis is not very popular in Côte d'Ivoire,” said tournament director Arzel Mevellec. “People like to attend something new, so that's good. We are the beginning of something.”




Abidjan, one of West Africa's key economic capitals, is located along the Gulf of Guinea on the Atlantic coast. It is also home to 22-year-old Eliakim Coulibaly, the country's brightest talent nearing the Top 300 of the PIF ATP Rankings, making Abidjan a logical location for the latest African Challenger destination.


The ATP Challenger Tour's expansion into the Côte d'Ivoire's former capital city is part of a larger effort to develop tennis across Africa. The Frenchman Mevellec is playing a key part, directing not only the Abidjan event, but also in Kigali, Rwanda and Brazzaville, as well as spearheading the Quimper Challenger in his home country.


“In France, tennis is popular. We have one million players. In Africa, they have one million players for the continent. That's a huge difference,” said Mevellec. “When you organise such tournaments, you need to especially think about the development for sure. In France, you cannot organise a tournament with no connections to clubs, for example. Here, you have to think about that.”


While Abidjan is taking a step forward as the next African city to host, it is part of the staircase leading to what could come next.


“The idea is to develop a tour in Africa, so that means we hope to have four or five weeks in a row on the west coast of the continent,” Mevellec said. “That is the aim of my action, to develop tennis in those parts of the world because it's not logical to have Africa outside the economy of tennis.”

Novak Djokovic has asserted that he does not understand the criticism Carlos Alcaraz has faced this year as he pointed out what his young rival has already accomplished.

Alcaraz has faced some harsh scrutiny this season, particularly during a mixed run of results prior to the clay-court season.

The world No 3 has amassed a strong 24-5 (82.8%) record across the seven tournaments he has played so far in 2025.

The 21-year-old has won titles in Rotterdam and Monte Carlo and was a runner-up at the Barcelona Open.

Alcaraz was also a semi-finalist in Indian Wells and a quarter-finalist at both the Australian Open and the Qatar Open, while he lost his opening match at the Miami Open.

The Spanish star has won 18 titles, including four Grand Slams and six Masters 1000 events, in his outstanding career to date.

Ahead of the 2025 Madrid Open, Djokovic took issue with the criticism Alcaraz has received in his home country.

“No, I don't understand it,” the Serbian told Eurosport Spain. “But the atmosphere and tradition of tennis in this country is very high.

“The expectation is enormous after Nadal, [Carlos] Moya, [Juan Carlos] Ferrero… they've all been world No 1.

“But, listen. He's 21 years old, he's won four Grand Slams and many tournaments. What more do you want? You want more, but what he's done in this period is incredible.”

Djokovic holds a 5-3 record against Alcaraz in what is a fascinating inter-generational rivalry.

The Serbian won the pair's most recent encounter in four sets in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open in January.

The duo are both in the bottom half of the Madrid Masters draw and could face off in the semi-finals.

Alcaraz, the No 2 seed, will play either Zizou Bergs or Yoshihito Nishioka in his first match in Madrid. Djokovic, who is seeded fourth, will take on Matteo Arnaldi or Borna Coric.

In an interview with GQ earlier this year, Djokovic addressed Alcaraz's achievements and the ambitious statements he has made.

“Carlos has done something no one has done in history for such a young age. So the odds are with him. He is going to complete his [career] Slam very soon,” the 24-time major winner said.

“He's even said himself, he wants to make history. He wants to be ‘the best in history.' I respect that kind of mentality of, ‘Hey, I think I got the goods.' But maybe it's a little bit early for him to think about history.”

                "On the tennis court, there wasn't that much difference between us, but in this I'm much better than them."

Tennis legend Andre Agassi will make his pro pickleball debut next week at the US Open Championships in Naples.

The 54-year-old Agassi, a former world No. 1 in tennis and winner of the Grand Slam, will partner with Anna Leigh Waters, the top-ranked women's player in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. The 18-year-old Waters teamed with JW Johnson to win the mixed doubles title at the 2024 US Open and paired with her mother Leigh to take the female doubles crown.

Agassi and Waters will play their first match on Wednesday, April 30. CBS Sports Network will televise their first match at noon.

Agassi told CNBS it was Waters' idea to play together after she saw videos of him playing pickleball on YouTube. She did not have a mixed doubles partner for this year's U.S. Open.

"She's probably sick of winning so much, and that's why she called me and asked me to play," Agassi told CNBC.

Started in 2016, the US Open Pickleball Championships is expected to attract more than 50,000 spectators for this year's event. Pro players will compete for a record purse of $163,400.

More than 3,400 competitors of all ages and levels are scheduled to descend on East Naples Community Park for the tournament, which is set for April 26-May 3. Professional and amateur athletes alike, representing all 50 states and 40 different countries. will be playing on the park's 60-plus courts. T

Defending champion Andrey Rublev is in danger of slipping down the ATP Rankings after the Madrid Open while Lorenzo Musetti is in line to make his top-10 debut.

Rublev lifted his second ATP Masters trophy last year when he defeated Felix Auger-Aliassime in the final, earning 1,000 ranking points in the process that helped him to solidify his position in the top 10.

But that 1,000 points will drop from his overall tally this week and he has dropped nine places to No 17, but, of course, he can still make up ground over the next fortnight with a run to the latter stages of the tournament.

The Madrid Open is a 96-player singles draw event and all 32 seeds receive byes into the second round, which means they earn 10 points without lifting a racket.

Winner: 1000 points
Finalist: 650 points
Semi-finalists: 400 points
Quarter-finalists: 200 points
Round of 16: 100 points
Round of 32: 50 points
First of 64: 10 points

So there is a bit of good news for Rublev as he is -990 ahead of his second-round match while Auger-Aliassime is -640, although the Canadian has dropped seven places in the Live Rankings to No 26.

World No 1 Jannik Sinner will, of course, not be in action at the Madrid Open as it is the last tournament he will miss due to his three-month suspension, but he will still drop 200 points after reaching the quarters last year.

The three-time Grand Slam winner will be back at the Italian Open in May.

Alexander Zverev is the top seed and it's an event where he can make up ground on Sinner and possibly put a gap between himself and third-placed Carlos Alcaraz.

The German is only defending 100 points from his third-round defeat in 2024 while Alcaraz, who was the two-time defending champion last year, lost in the quarter-final and will drop 200 points (190 when his 10 points for his bye are added).

Taylor Fritz lost in the last four against Rublev and so will drop 400 points, but remains at No 4 in the Live Rankings while Jiri Lehecka was the other semi-finalist and he has slipped 10 places to No 37.

Daniil Medvedev and Francisco Cerundolo joined Sinner and Alcaraz in exiting at the quarter-final stage so they will effectively be -190.

Novak Djokovic and Jack Draper are the biggest “winners” in the top 10 as they the former didn't compete last year so he won't drop any points while Draper is defending only 30 points.

Lorenzo Musetti is currently at a career-high No 11 in the official rankings, but he has climbed two places to No 9 in the Live Rankings as he lost in the second round last year.

Instead, points for his 19th best result will be deducted so he will drop 50 points before another 10 is added for his bye.

1. Jannik Sinner – 9,730 points
2. Alexander Zverev – 7,995
3. Carlos Alcaraz – 7,860
4. Taylor Fritz – 4,725
5. Novak Djokovic – 4,130
6. Jack Draper – 3,800
7. Alex de Minaur – 3,454
8. Holger Rune – 3,440 (+1)
9. Lorenzo Musetti – 3,160 (+2)
10. Tommy Paul – 3,120 (+2)
11. Daniil Medvedev – 3,100 (-1)
12. Ben Shelton – 2,980 (+1)
13. Arthur Fils – 2,920 (+1)
14. Casper Ruud – 2,725 (+1)
15. Grigor Dimitrov – 2,595 (+1)
16. Frances Tiafoe – 2,550 (+1)
17. Andrey Rublev – 2,540 (-9)
18. Stefanos Tsitsipas – 2,380
19. Tomas Machac – 2,215 (+1)
20. Ugo Humbert – 2,145 (+2)

The likes of Djokovic, Draper, De Minaur and newly-crowned Barcelona Open winner Holger Rune could receive nice ranking boosts if they enjoy runs to the latter stages at the Madrid Open.


                Novak Djokovic has sent a clear message to Carlos Alcaraz's critics.             


                "On the tennis court, there wasn't that much difference between us, but in this I'm much better than them."            


                Carlos Alcaraz may be forced to pull out of the Madrid Open, according to a report in Spain.            


                Rafael Nadal is "sure" Jannik Sinner is "an innocent and moral person."

Carlos Alcaraz has become the prince of Wimbledon. Aged just 21, the Spaniard lifted the title two years in a row, beating Novak Djokovic in both finals. But even two-time champions aren't exempt from the All England Club's strict rules.

Players must compete in an all-white kit when playing on the club's hallowed courts. And Alcaraz learned that the hard way, when he was told off and warned that he wouldn't be allowed to play his next match if a banned colour was on show.

The current world No. 3 gave fans a unique insight into his 2024 season in his new Netflix docuseries My Way. It was a year of highs and lows - Alcaraz suffered heartbreak in the Olympic gold medal match and lost early at the US Open.

But he completed the Channel Slam by winning the French Open and Wimbledon back-to-back. Alcaraz let the Netflix cameras follow him during his title defence at SW19 last summer, and he revealed that he got into some trouble at the All England Club.

The four-time Grand Slam champion loves Wimbledon's history and tradition, though he has fallen foul of the stringent rules himself.

“I think Wimbledon is one of the most elegant tournaments in the world, if not the most elegant one, be it for its prestige or its rules. You can't step onto the court unless you're dressed in all white,” he said.

Remembering his own past experience, Alcaraz added: “I was wearing colour briefs and you could see them through my shorts, and they called me out on them, saying, ‘Next time, we won't let you play.'

“I mean, this really goes to show you just how strict they can be!”

The world No. 3 has since learned to play by the rules at Wimbledon and become a dominant force at the tournament. He beat seven-time champion Djokovic in a thrilling five-set final in 2023.

Then, a year later, Alcaraz dominated in a replay of the championship match, winning in straight sets.

“I started the final really strong, I was focused,” he recalled. “I knew exactly what to do. I did everything the same way, following the same pattern. Not once did I let him trip me up.”

Things got tricky when Alcaraz blew three championship points when serving for the title but he managed to get the job done in a tiebreak.

The Spaniard will return to SW19 this summer looking for a hat-trick of trophies. His last loss at Wimbledon came in 2022, when he reached the fourth round and was beaten by Jannik Sinner.

Rafael Nadal enjoyed a legendary tennis career, winning 22 Grand Slam titles during his time on tour.

The Spaniard broke several records as a professional, perhaps the most impressive of which was his tally of 14 French Open titles.

Two years after his final Roland Garros triumph in 2022, Nadal retired from tennis when Spain were knocked out of the 2024 Davis Cup Finals.

Nadal's absence has been felt ever since, as fans of the 22-time Major champion miss seeing the star perform at the highest level.

One of Nadal's ATP Tour rivals has now revealed what he has found ‘strange' since the 38-year-old retired from tennis last November.

Speaking in an interview ahead of the 2025 Madrid Open, Roberto Bautista Agut shared his thoughts on Nadal.

“Rafa [Nadal] is missed a lot on the circuit,” he said.

“I think I've been lucky enough to enjoy it for many years, and well, the truth is that it's strange, when you've been living with some players for many, many years, and then they leave and you stay, it is not easy, it is different.

“Luckily, we have Carlos [Alcaraz] who has taken Rafa's place very well, and if we are lucky, we will enjoy him for many years [as well].”

Alcaraz and Nadal are two of three Spanish players to have won multiple men's Grand Slam titles during the Open Era.

Bautista Agut played five matches against his fellow countrymen, but failed to record a victory against Alcaraz or Nadal.

Bautista Agut lost to Nadal in the semi-finals of the 2014 Madrid Open on debut, 4-6, 3-6, his best-ever result in the Spanish capital.

Bautista Agut may never have beaten Nadal or Alcaraz, but that's not to say he hasn't scored some big wins over the years.

The world number 55 hadn't qualified for a Major quarterfinal before 2019, when he embarked on an impressive Grand Slam campaign.

Bautista Agut knocked out Andy Murray, John Millman, Karen Khachanov, and Marin Cilic on his way to the Australian Open quarterfinals in January.

There, he lost to Greek star Stefanos Tsitsipas in four sets, learning some valuable lessons ahead of his next deep Grand Slam run.

That run came at Wimbledon, where the Spaniard shocked the world by reaching the semi-finals at SW19.

Even Bautista Agut himself was surprised by his run in 2019, admitting after his quarterfinal win that he'd planned to be in Spain for his ‘stag do' during the second week of Wimbledon.

“I had planned to be in Ibiza right now,” he said.

“We had everything organised already. Well, it feels better to be here in London.”

Bautista Agut's Cinderella run came to an end in the semi-finals as he fell to defeat against eventual champion Novak Djokovic in four sets, 2-6, 6-4, 3-6, 2-6.

The 37-year-old hasn't returned to a Grand Slam quarterfinal since and lost in the first round of this year's Australian Open.

Bautista Agut will return to action at the Madrid Open, where he'll take on his fellow Spaniard Jaume Munar on Wednesday, April 23.

The ATP Mutua Madrid Open is a historic Masters tournament played on the clay courts in Madrid, Spain. First-round action will begin on Day 1, and multiple Spanish players will be in action. As always, we at LWOT will offer predictions for every match on the slate. But who will advance?

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Camilo Ugo Carabelli has played at a high level this year, especially on clay and is sitting on his career high ranking of 59. This will be his first main draw appearance at the Madrid Masters, and he will hope to make a winning start. However, Madrid's courts don't play like usual clay courts due to the high altitude, which can affect Carabelli's rhythm. These courts should suit Christopher O'Connell's game style as he likes pace on the ball. The Australian player lost a close match to Luciano Darderi last week in Munich and will look to bounce back from that defeat. This should be a close contest, but I am going with O'Connell.

Prediction: O'Connell in 3

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Despite being played on his home soil, Pedro Martinez has never won a match at the Madrid Masters. His failures must have been influenced by the fact that the conditions here are different from those found in a typical clay court tournament. However, he would back himself to get his first win here against Francisco Comesana, who will play the main draw for the first time. Martinez will have the crowd support, and that should help him play his best tennis.

Prediction: Martinez in 3

Head-to-Head: Bautista Agut 2-1 Munar

Roberto Bautista Agut will make his 11th appearance in the main draw of the Madrid Masters, and the crowd will be cheering for him with all their heart. He is not at his best anymore, but should be motivated to perform in front of so much support. Statistically, clay has been the least successful surface for Bautista Agut and Jaume Munar, who played some great tennis this season, would be the favourite heading into this match. Munar's younger legs and aggression should give him the edge in rallies. In the battle of Spaniards, I am favouring the younger one to win.

Prediction: Munar in 3

An all-French first round clash, Moutet is a pedestrian 7-9 on the year, Mayot came through qualifying in some form but has failed to win an ATP level main draw match this season, Moutet has a bit more upside to his game, so he should be a slight favorite.

Prediction: Moutet in 3

By Gianni Taina

Born on June 8, 1997, in Riga, Latvia, Jelena Ostapenko's journey to tennis stardom began early. She turned professional in 2012 but truly announced herself in 2017 when she shocked the world by winning Roland Garros, defeating then-world No. 3 Simona Halep. 

That stunning victory marked her as one to watch, though her career since has been marked by both highs and lows. In 2025, however, Ostapenko has found her groove, delivering standout performances throughout the season.

Recently, she captured the WTA Stuttgart title with a commanding 6-4, 6-1 win over Aryna Sabalenka, boosting her WTA ranking significantly. Known for her fiery personality, Ostapenko has faced her share of controversies, including clashes with other players, such as a heated exchange with Elena Rybakina in Rome.

Just two days after her 20th birthday, Ostapenko secured her career-defining Roland Garros title. Her three-set victory over Simona Halep (3-6, 6-4, 6-3) remains a watershed moment. Reflecting on that time, Ostapenko admitted, “My life changed when I won in Paris. I needed time to adapt. It wasn't easy because I was 20. It's very difficult to get used to so much attention and pressure”.

After her 2017 triumph, injuries and inconsistency hampered Ostapenko's progress. She struggled to maintain her form and went title-less in 2018. But by 2019, she was back, claiming the Eastbourne title on grass—a testament to her resilience.

Ostapenko has never shied away from confrontation, earning a reputation as one of the WTA Tour's most polarizing figures. In 2024, she famously refused to shake hands with Victoria Azarenka after a match, with reports suggesting lingering tension between the two. 

In 2021, she clashed with Ajla Tomljanović, accusing her opponent of feigning an injury during a match. Her infamous outburst against Elena Rybakina in 2023, where she reportedly insulted her at the net, remains one of the circuit's most talked-about incidents.

Addressing her behavior, Ostapenko told to Clay: “When I play against someone I don't like, I really want to beat them. I don't enjoy making opponents angry; I just focus on myself. I'm emotional, and sometimes I say or do things I shouldn't”.

Ostapenko made headlines at the 2023 US Open when she demanded the removal of a disruptive fan during her third-round match against Bernarda Pera. Explaining her actions, she said, “He started yelling like crazy while I was serving. It wasn't just one or two words—it was several sentences. I told him to leave, and he did.”

Despite Iga Swiatek's dominance in recent years, the Polish star has yet to solve the Ostapenko puzzle. The Latvian boasts a perfect 6-0 record against Swiatek, with her latest victory coming in Stuttgart.

Ostapenko's Stuttgart performance was nothing short of extraordinary. She first took down Swiatek, the world No. 2, then cruised past Aleksandrova, and capped it off with a dominant win over Sabalenka, the top-ranked player, in the final. 

Her commanding 6-4, 6-1 victory not only earned her the title but also propelled her to No. 18 in the WTA rankings. With this run, Ostapenko achieved a feat not seen since Serena Williams—defeating the world's top two players en route to a WTA clay-court championship.

Following her win, Ostapenko said, “I didn't tell anyone, but I felt I was going to win this week. I'm playing better every day, and I believe I deserve results like this”. She now turns her attention to Madrid, Rome, and Roland Garros, where she hopes to reclaim the title she won in 2017.

With her Stuttgart win, Ostapenko reached another milestone. She became the first woman since Serena Williams to win at least one WTA title on all major surfaces—outdoor clay, indoor clay, outdoor hard, indoor hard, and grass. She joins Petra Kvitová as the only other player to achieve this feat in singles.

Joanna Gaines is plotting for you to do the easy work in your next home renovation.

Magnolia Network has dropped a new trailer for Gaines' show “Mini Reni” that aims to feature smaller renovations that pretty much any homeowner can do.

“It doesn't have to be a dramatic renovation. It can literally be simple little details,” Gaines says. “The hope is that we can inspire you to tackle your own mini reni.”

As we reported recently, “Mini Reni” is Gaines' solo outing that will feature the host as she “takes on a series of ‘mini' projects with quick timelines. In each episode, she makes a few intentional, creative additions to transform smaller spaces with big impact.”

“As your home evolves, as the story of your family evolves, you want to make these spaces work for you,” says Gaines about the premise of the show.

“This is where I can feel a bit more freedom to try new ideas,” she adds. “And end with these fresh finished spaces that didn't require months of work.”

Gaines' popular renovation series, “Fixer Upper,” with husband Chip – as well as other shows of the same ilk – would see projects take anywhere from three to eight months to complete.

“Mini Reni” will feature nine episodes of smaller projects including a secret passageway leading to a playroom. There's also what appear to be his and her home offices in another featured space.

No matter the project, the host is looking to keep everything on budget.

“Some of these little cheats can make it feel more impactful, make it feel more elevated,” Gaines said. “But you're not spending too much to make a pretty cool impact.”

A post shared by Joanna Gaines (@joannagaines)

“How do we mess with something that's really simple that you can get at your local hardware store?” Gaines adds. 

Fans are excited about the new show. 

One commented on Instagram “Small changes with a big impact are so cool! ❤️”

Another wants ideas for their home, writing “YES 🙌🏾 I've been waiting for more mini rinis! Any tips on an apartment rini? My apartment is just too white and sterile.”

One fan is just excited to see Gaines again: “The original Queen of homestyle is back!!!!! Love this-can't wait.”

“Mini Reni” premieres Wednesday, May 14 at 8 PM on Magnolia Network before premiering on Max and Discovery Plus. The first season will run through July.

	The Irish rap group Kneecap have never shied away from politics, and their recent sets at Coachella sparked controversy after they included messages defending Palestine during their performances on both weekends. In an email to Rolling Stone, band member Mo Chara explained that Kneecap have spoken about Palestine “at every single gig since the band's formation, long before October 2023 as the oppression and brutal occupation of Palestine has been ongoing for 77 years,” and responded to some of the criticism that's followed.


	“We believe we have an obligation to use our platform when we can to raise the issue of Palestine, and it was important for us to speak out at Coachella as the USA is the main funder and supplier of weapons to Israel as they commit genocide in Gaza,” he says. “As I said from the stage, ‘The U.S. government could stop the genocide tomorrow.' It's important that young Americans hear and know it.”


	During its first Coachella performance, the band had planned to have several projections with pro-Palestine text on them. However, these didn't make it onstage, and the set was cut short on Coachella's YouTube livestream. “We only heard about it the next day and haven't heard from anyone officially,” Mo Chara tells Rolling Stone. “It's not surprising, large companies don't like to hear the truth unless it suits their narrative and pocket.”

	The second weekend, the projections read, “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,” followed by, “It is being enabled by the U.S. government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes.” A final screen said, “Fuck Israel. Free Palestine.” At the end, the crowd launched into a “Free Palestine” chant. “This is something that happens at all of our gigs from Spain to Scotland and Ireland to Iceland because people know what's happening is wrong and are angry about it,” Mo Chara writes. “The crowd chanting ‘Free Palestine' at Coachella was a message of solidarity to the people of Gaza from regular Americans who want to see an end to the genocide, despite their government's arming and funding Israel.”

	The performance ignited major backlash, with organizations and public figures alike speaking out and describing the set as anti-Israel. (“Israel has murdered over 52,000 Palestinians in Gaza in the last 18 months, mostly women and children,” Mo Chara writes. “They have obliterated much of the Gaza Strip with U.S.-supplied weapons and are currently starving over 2 million Gazans. People can make their own decisions about whether our message is anti-Israel, but for us, it's about their government's sickening actions, not ordinary people.”) On X, Sharon Osbourne urged people to advocate for revoking band members' visas, saying that their projections displayed “anti-Israel messages and hate speech” and that they “openly support terrorist organizations.” Asked about Osbourne's tweets, Mo Chara responded, “Her rant has so many holes in it that it hardly warrants a reply, but she should listen to ‘War Pigs' that was written by Black Sabbath (her husband).”

	











	Organizers of the Nova Music Festival, the site of the deadly Hamas attack that preceded Israel's crackdown on Gaza, also invited the band to the Nova Exhibition to “experience firsthand the stories of those who were murdered, those who survived, and those who are still being held hostage.”

	Mo Chara didn't respond to questions about whether they'd accept that offer, but said simply, “There are over 10,000 Palestinians being held hostage in Israeli jails as we speak, many of them without charge or trial, including 400 children who are being held illegally under international law. As I said already, over 52,000 Palestinians have been murdered in the last 18 months, and over 2 million displaced in Gaza. Who is talking about the 30,000 innocent children who have been murdered in Gaza in the last 18 months?… Our message is about ending the genocide and ending the ongoing illegal occupation of Palestine.”


	He adds: “We want people to take whatever action they can to stop the genocide. People can take what they want from our music, stopping the genocide is more important.”

Nearly three years since it commenced shooting and almost five years since the original film first hit Netflix, the streamer's hit action franchise “The Old Guard” is finally readying to release its sequel. The streamer today announced that “The Old Guard 2,” the second film in the Charlize Theron-starring comic book adaptation series, will start streaming globally on Wednesday, July 2, 2025. 

The film, directed by Victoria Mahoney (who takes over from original director Gina Prince-Bythewood) comes with a script by Greg Rucka (who wrote the original comic book miniseries the films are based on) and Sarah L. Walker. And Theron, who also produces, is joined by an array of both new and returning stars, including KiKi Layne, Matthias Schoenaerts, Marwan Kenzari, Luca Marinelli, Veronica Ngô, Henry Golding, Uma Thurman, and Chiwetel Ejiofor.

Per the film's official synopsis: “Andy (Charlize Theron) and her team of immortal warriors are back, with a renewed sense of purpose in their mission to protect the world. With Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts) still in exile after his betrayal, and Quynh (Veronica Ngô) out for revenge after escaping her underwater prison, Andy grapples with her newfound mortality as a mysterious threat emerges that could jeopardize everything she's worked towards for thousands of years. Andy, Nile (KiKi Layne), Joe (Marwan Kenzari), Nicky (Luca Marinelli) and James Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) enlist the help of Tuah (Henry Golding), an old friend who may provide the key to unlocking the mystery behind immortal existence.”

Last year, Theron told Variety that the release hold-ups had been a product of various changes at both Netflix and beyond. “Netflix went through quite a changeover. We got kind of stuck in that and our post-production shut down, I think, five weeks into it,” she said. “They were going through a lot of changes, and I totally understand it. We finally picked it back up and I'm really excited about it.”

EXCLUSIVE: Universal Pictures and 87North are continuing to build on their strong relationship as sources tell Deadline the studio has landed Fight from the company, with David Leitch attached to direct from a spec script written by Nathaniel Halpern.


	Plot details are being kept under wraps, but given Leitch and 87North's involvement, expect high-octane thrills with over-the-top action pieces.


	Kelly McCormick and Leitch, producers of the action films The Fall Guy, Bullet Train and Nobody, will produce Fight via 87North's first look-deal with Universal. John Schoenfelder and Russell Ackerman will produce, and Jay Schuminsky will executive produce for NeoText.

	











	EVP Production Development Jay Polidoro and Director of Development Tony Ducret will oversee the project for the studio.




			Watch on Deadline		







	87North and Universal previous collaborations include Hobbs & Shaw and Fall Guy, which Leitch directed, as well as Nobody and Love Hurts. Universal will release 87North's next film with the studio, Nobody 2, on August 15.


	Leitch is currently in prep on his next pic How to Rob a Bank, which he will direct this summer and stars Nicholas Hoult and Pete Davidson.


	Halpern is the creator, showrunner and sole writer of Amazon's Tales From the Loop, which was produced by Matt Reeves with Mark Romanek directing the pilot.


	Schoenfelder and Ackerman were most recently executive producers on the Netflix/AGBO film The Electric State, and are EPs on the upcoming Skydance film They Will Kill You starring Zazie Beetz.


	Leitch is repped by CAA and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole. Halpern is repped by CAA, Untitled and Greg Slewett at Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole LLP.

Netflix has ordered The Age Of Innocence, a limited series based on Edith Wharton's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. Emma Frost (The White Queen, The White Princess) has penned the adaptation and will serve as executive producer and showrunner on the Chernin Entertainment production.


	The series was quietly greenlighted earlier this year and has been prepping for a fall start of production in Europe for a couple of months now. Netflix would not confirm the pickup to Deadline, instead opting to announce it on World Book Day. 


	A fresh take on Edith Wharton's classic novel of forbidden love in 19th century New York, The Age Of Innocence is a will-they/won't-they love triangle exploring themes of freedom, duty, identity and love in all its forms. 

	











	The project is clearly geared toward the wide global fanbase of Netflix's hit period romance drama Bridgerton, also a book adaptation. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Frost executive produces with Peter Chernin, Jenno Topping and Tracey Cook of Chernin Entertainment, part of the North Road Company.


	Wharton's novel was notably adapted by Martin Scorsese in the 1993 Columbia Pictures feature starring Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer, Winona Ryder, and Miriam Margolyes.

Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is begging President Donald Trump to reconsider the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) denial of an emergency disaster declaration to aid in the recovery from a series of destructive tornadoes and storms that ravaged the red state in March. 


	Sanders, a former White House press secretary to Trump, wrote a lengthy letter last week to her ex-boss detailing the damage caused by the storms and begging him reconsider FEMA's denial. 


	“The severe storms and tornadoes that occurred on March 14 and 15, 2025, produced catastrophic impacts across the state. The sheer magnitude of this event resulted in overwhelming amounts of debris, widespread destruction to homes and businesses, the tragic loss of three lives and injuries to many others. Less than three weeks later, Arkansas was once again devastated by a second wave of severe storms, tornadoes, and a generational flooding event,” Sanders wrote in her appeal. “Without the support of a Major Disaster Declaration, Arkansas will face significant challenges in assuming full responsibility and achieving an effective recovery from this event. I have determined that the severity and magnitude of these storms exceed the capabilities of the State and affected local governments to respond adequately. As such, supplemental Federal assistance is crucial.”

	











	It's unsurprising that states are already struggling to get disaster-recovery aid under the second Trump administration. In January, Trump floated eliminating the agency entirely. Last month, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem promised to “eliminate FEMA,” on the heels of a series of so-called Department of Government Efficiency-fueled layoffs at the agency.

	During his first term, Trump had a habit of setting up roadblocks to states requesting disaster-relief aid depending on his personal relationship with — or the politics of — their leadership. The president once held out on approving aid funds for regions of California scorched by wildfires until staff presented him with evidence that people in the affected areas were actually his fans. In another instance, he ignored requests from Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, for funds to respond to a series of wildfires in 2020.

	During the 2024 election cycle, Trump falsely accused FEMA and the Biden administration of “stealing” billions in disaster aid to support undocumented migrants, while leaving parts of North Carolina devastated by Hurricane Helene to fend for themselves. 


	When wildfires ravaged Los Angeles earlier this year, the president and his GOP allies floated conditioning aid to California with compliance to their own policy and ideological goals. These included forcing the implementation of Voter ID laws, and crackdowns on immigration.

	Trump and Republicans have been salivating at the idea of eliminating the agency — because they think it would save money, or they want states to handle their own disaster relief, or both. But as Sanders wrote in her plea to Trump, Arkansas is unable to handle the recovery effort without federal funds. The thing about natural disasters is that they don't have any conception of state lines, nor do they check your voter registration before leveling your house, which is why an agency like FEMA exists to coordinate the response to disasters that span multiple states, some of which might not have the resources to combat the destruction.


	While Trump and Noem are making hay over their plans to destroy FEMA, members of their own party are begging them to stand down.

Antonio Banderas is set to co-star opposite Dominic Sessa in Tony, the Anthony Bourdain movie from A24, Star Thrower and Zapruder Films. Matt Johnson is directing from a script by Todd Bartels and Lou Howe.


	The logline is under wraps, but sources say the film takes place during the summer of 1976, when a young Anthony Bourdain has a life-changing summer in Provincetown. It is unknown who Banderas will play.


	A24 will produce with Tim and Trevor White under their Star Thrower banner, along with Johnson and Matthew Miller through their Zapruder Films. Chris Stinson, Amy Greene, Howe, Bartels and Emily Rose will executive produce. Kimberly Witherspoon, who represents Bourdain's estate, will also executive produce.

As is tradition, the Cannes Film Festival has announced late-breaking additions to its 2025 festival lineup, with new films coming from Lynne Ramsay, and Saeed Roustayi.

The 78th edition will now include Ramsay's “Die, My Love,” starring Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson, in the competition. All the Scottish director's previous films have premiered at Cannes; the dark martial comedy/horror is her first film since 2017's “You Were Never Really Here” won the Cannes Best Screenplay prize. Here, Jennifer Lawrence plays a wife unraveling in the country, and married to Pattinson's character. LaKeith Stanfield, Nick Nolte, and Sissy Spacek also star in this adaptation of Ariana Harwicz's novel. Ramsay wrote the script with Enda Walsh and Alice Birch.

The film made it into Cannes just in time as hoped, and this means we'll be seeing Lawrence and Pattinson standing in front of glittering flash bulbs on the Palais red carpet.

Meanwhile, “Woman and Child,” the latest film by Iranian director Saeed Roustaee, will also join the competition this year. Roustaee was nominated for the Palme d'Or in 2022 for “Leila's Brothers,” a three-hour family epic starring frequent Asghar Farhadi collaborator Taraneh Alidoosti.

In Un Certain Regard, Kristen Stewart's long-in-the-works directorial debut “The Chronology of Water,” starring Imogen Poots, will compete for the Camera d'Or. The film is based on Lidia Yuknavitch's memoir about finding salvation out of abuse by becoming a swimmer.

Simón Mesa Soto's “Un Poeta” and Pedro Pinho's “O Riso e a Faca (Le Rire et le Couteau)” will also debut in Un Certain Regard.

Kōji Fukada's “Renai Saiban,” Hlynur Pálmason's “Astin Sem Eftir Er,” and Lav Diaz's “Magalhaes” will join the Cannes premiere section.

Vincent Maël Cardona's “Le Roi Soleil” and Ethan Coen's “Honey Don't,” starring Margaret Qualley, will premiere in the Midnight section.

In Special Screenings, “Amelie et la Metaphysique des Tubes” from Maïlys Vallade and Liane-Cho Han, “Mama” from Or Sinai, “Arco” from Ugo Bienvenu, and “Qui Brille au Combat” from Josephine Japy join the lineup.

And as part of a tribute to Pierre Richard, “L'Homme Qui a Vu L'ours Qui a Vu L'homme” will play the festival.

See the full 78th Cannes Film Festival lineup here. The latest additions join new films from Wes Anderson (“The Phoenician Scheme”), Kelly Reichardt (“The Mastermind”), Ari Aster (“Eddington”), Julia Ducournau (“Alpha”), Spike Lee (“Highest 2 Lowest”), Joachim Trier (“Sentimental Value”), and more.

Olivia Wilde is back in the director's chair, as the “Booksmart” and “Don't Worry Darling” filmmaker is currently filming her third directorial outing, “The Invite,” per Variety. Wilde, who also had a small role in “Don't Worry Darling,” will also appear in the film, alongside a cast that also includes Seth Rogen (who she recently appeared alongside in “The Studio”), Penélope Cruz, and Edward Norton. Principal photography has started in Los Angeles.

Per Variety, the film is billed as “a provocative date night comedy inspired by the Spanish film ‘Sentimental.'” The original 2020 film, directed by Cesc Gay, was a smash in Spain and was nominated for multiple Goyas (winning Best Supporting Actor for star Alberto San Juan). The film follows two couples, neighbors who do not quite get along, who come together for a dinner date night that inspires some unexpected (and, we're guessing, sexy and funny) revelations.

Gay's film has already been remade in several countries, including Italy, Switzerland and France. The script for Wilde's film was adapted by Rashida Jones and Will McCormack, best known for their 2012 romantic dramedy “Celeste & Jesse Forever.” 

An earlier version of the film was set to be directed by “Little Miss Sunshine” duo Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton, and was to star Amy Adams, Paul Rudd, and Tessa Thompson. That version was announced in 2023 but flamed out at some point.

Wilde's directing card is quite full these days, and she's also attached to direct Universal Pictures' Christmas comedy “Naughty” and Warner Bros.' “Avengelyne,” a film adaptation of the '90s comic book character, both of which will be produced by  LuckyChap. Also coming up: a starring role in Gregg Araki's much-anticipated “I Want Your Sex.”

The film is produced by FilmNation Entertainment's Ben Browning, Annapurna Pictures' Megan Ellison, and David Permut. Patrick Chu, Annapurna Head of Film and Television, is executive producing. FilmNation Entertainment and Annapurna Pictures are co-financing.

FilmNation Entertainment is co-repping domestic rights with UTA Independent Film Group and is handling international sales. The deals were negotiated by FilmNation Entertainment's Alison Cohen and Ben Ryzak and Chris Corabi on behalf of Annapurna.

This time, the Predator is one of the good guys. “Predator” franchise installment “Predator: Badlands” turns the trope on its side with the title creature instead helping the lead hero defeat a different threat.

“Predator: Badlands” stars Elle Fanning as Thia, a woman living on a remote planet that befriends a young Predator (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi) who is an outcast from his clan. Together, they “embark on a treacherous journey in search of the ultimate adversary,” as the official synopsis reads. “Prey” director Dan Trachtenberg helms the film, with Patrick Aison penning the screenplay.

 










Trachtenberg told Empire that Fanning was pushed “dramatically, physically, [and] logistically” during production. “She faced intense challenges on this movie,” Trachtenberg said. Internet sleuths have already guessed that in certain frames, Fanning's Thia could be a Weyland-Yutani android.

Trachtenberg added that “Predator: Badlands” differs from previous franchise films as the alien creature will be “front and center, leading the charge” instead. “He's still badass, but there's something there that touches you emotionally, too,” Trachtenberg said of the Predator played by Schuster-Koloamatangi. “Creating a character you connect with, but are also super-intimidated by, has been challenging. But exciting.”

Trachtenberg previously directed “Predator” prequel “Prey,” which debuted on Hulu. “Prey” took place in 1719 and followed an Indigenous woman (Amber Midthunder) who fought for survival against alien invaders. Trachtenberg told Empire that he wanted to “find another essential piece of cinema that does what ‘Prey' did spiritually — pushing the franchise's boundaries, letting us root for a hero we rarely get to root for — but in a different way. And that transformed into this big idea of rooting for the Predator.”

The “Predator” franchise began in 1987 with the original movie that starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, late actor Carl Weathers, and Jesse Ventura. A trio of sequels followed, released in 1990, 2010, and 2018, as well as 2004 spin-off “Alien vs. Predator.”

“Predator: Badlands” is produced by Trachtenberg, John Davis, Marc Toberoff, Ben Rosenblatt, and Brent O'Connor. The film will be released in in IMAX, Dolby Cinema, Cinemark XD, 4DX, ScreenX, and premium screens everywhere.

 










“Predator: Badlands” premieres November 7 in theaters from 20th Century Studios. Check out the teaser below.

	20th Century Studios has dropped the first trailer for Predator: Badlands, the next anticipated live-action installment in the Predator franchise, which will be released in theaters and on IMAX November 7.


	The twist to this one? Man and extraterrestrial are on the same side. Starring Elle Fanning and Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi, the film is set in the future on a remote planet, where a young Predator (Schuster-Koloamatangi), outcast from his clan, finds an unlikely ally in Thia (Fanning) and embarks on a treacherous journey in search of the ultimate adversary.


	Dan Trachtenberg, the filmmaker behind 20th/Hulu smash Prey, directed the film, from his script written with Patrick Aison. He also produced alongside John Davis, Marc Toberoff, Ben Rosenblatt, and Brent O'Connor.Trachtenberg brought new life to Predator with Prey, a film unlike any other in the franchise, which centered on a young Comanche warrior's (Amber Midthunder) clash with Predators during the 1700s. In addition to setting viewership records for Hulu, it garnered six Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Television Movie. Upon his success there, Trachtenberg has seemingly been given the reins to the franchise, directing not only Badlands, but the animated Killer of Killers, premiering on Hulu June 6, as well.

Pete Davidson is staying humble about his “SNL” experience. The actor, who starred on “Saturday Night Live” from 2014 to 2022, told Variety that there are “hundreds” of fellow cast members who “did better work” than him during his tenure on the sketch series. 

Davidson first joined at age 20 as a featured player. He later parted ways with the live show in May 2022; however, he returned for the “SNL50” event in 2025. 

“I think I was very lucky to get my own own video [during the ‘SNL50' special],” Davidson said. “There's 1,000 cast members and hundreds that are more popular and did better work than I did while I was there. I was just very grateful to be in a sketch and have a video and even just be invited. It was very surreal to see.”

Davidson added, “I know I was there for almost a decade but even when I came back and hosted, I was like, ‘Wow, I do know all these guys.' I know [creator] Lorne [Michaels], I know most of the cast. It just hits different when you see, like, Meryl Streep doing a sketch. And I also know it was a bunch of people who were in nothing so I'm just very grateful. It was a really surreal moment, and I'm happy that it went well for Lorne and just for the history and the integrity of the institution.” 

He added that Michaels, who executive produced Davidson's meta Peacock series “Bupkis,” was a father figure to him. Davidson famously lost his dad in 9/11. 

“Yeah, he's like my dad kind of. He's really, really sweet,” he said of Michaels, “and has always been above and beyond understanding of my life, and just supportive in all the right ways. I'm very lucky.” 

Davidson previously told Jon Berthnal during his “Real Ones” podcast that he at times felt like a “loser” due to his celebrity status. “Suddenly you're in this zeitgeist and that has nothing to do with the work,” Davidson said of his tabloid-driven fame while on the series. “And that's a really shitty feeling. I became more known before the work was there, but I was always working.”

He added of certain quips at his expense, “When your own show [pokes fun at you], I'd be sitting in the back watching the cold open and — the cold open [is] topical, political humor, whatever's in the culture. And then, making fun of you. Then you've got to walk out and do a sketch next and hit your mark and the show just made fun of you. So, why are they going to laugh at you? Like, they just dogged you in front of everyone. And you're like, ‘I'm a fucking loser, man.'”

 










Yet Davidson has always credited Michaels for having his back. “Nobody ever showed more leeway and grace to me than [‘SNL‘ creator] Lorne Michaels, and I owe my life to that guy,” he said, “but it was fucking confusing cause the nature of entertainment is the nature of this business. At the end of the day, that's what it is. This was a really difficult thing to do. You feel small. You feel super insecure.”

	The Tennessee Board of Parole has recommended a pardon for Jelly Roll — who has spoken openly about his criminal record and time served incarcerated — following a nearly two-hour hearing Tuesday in Nashville.


	The board voted unanimously to pardon the singer born Jason DeFord, with their recommendation sent to Governor Bill Lee, who must sign off on the pardon. “The reporting on Jelly Roll, that's encouraging for his situation, but there are steps yet to happen in that case,” Lee said (via The Associated Press).


	“This was incredible,” Jelly Roll said of the board's decision. “I pray this goes through. But today was special for me, regardless.”


	Jelly Roll, now 40 years old, spent time behind bars in his early 20s on drug and robbery charges. The singer has often talked about how his incarceration was a life-changing experience and inspired him to pursue music. Jelly Roll also frequently speaks to prisoners and juveniles, “teaching people how to recover the right way, through therapy and through music, through redemption and giving them real second chances,” as he told a Helping Addicts Recover Progressively program earlier this year.

	“I want to be an inspiration for people who are now where I used to be — to let them know that change is truly possible,” Jelly Roll told the board on Tuesday. “One of the reasons I'm asking for your recommendation for this pardon is because I'm looking to take my message of redemption through the power of music and faith, through the rest of the world.”

	Another reason Jelly Roll seeks a pardon: With his criminal record, touring internationally — while not impossible, as he recently embarked on his first tour of Canada — has been logistically difficult, telling the board that he requires “a team of lawyers and a mountain of paperwork to secure my entry into those countries.”


	Jelly Roll's parole process began in October 2024, which marked five years since his last sentence expired.

Tony Gilroy on why that sexual assault attempt against an "undocumented" fugitive in the show's season two premiere block was necessary to tell an accurate tale of revolution — even within the Star Wars universe. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


[This story contains spoilers from the first three episodes of Andor season two.]


	Disney+'s acclaimed Andor has stretched the creative boundaries of Star Wars in countless ways, bringing a grown-up sensibility to a galaxy far, far away.




	Yet even by Andor standards, a scene from the second season is leaving fans shocked: An Imperial officer tries to violently rape a Rebel fugitive, Bix Caleen (Adria Arjona), who is hiding out in a farming settlement while Imperial troops are rounding up “undocumented” citizens (read some sample reactions below).

					'Andor' Season 2 Premiere Scene Has a Real-Life Nazi Inspiration		
			









	The sequence plays out over the course of the show's third episode (the first three episodes were released all at once on Tuesday) with the officer's flirtation with Bix turning growing increasingly persistent and eventually cumulating with a brutal life-and-death struggle. Bix eventually gets the upper hand and the officer is killed. But Andor boldly leaves zero ambiguity as to what viewers just witnessed as Bix screams, “He tried to rape me!”


Star Wars is a franchise that has never — in film form — shown even consensual sex. During its first season, Andor pushed the envelope with scenes that suggested sex was about to take place, or just had (much like old Hollywood films during the Hays Code censorship era).


	When asked about the Bix scene, Andor creator Tony Gilroy explained to The Hollywood Reporter that when telling a story about a war, shying away from sexual assault didn't feel truthful.


	“I get one shot to tell everything I know — or can discover, or that I've learned — about revolution, about battles, with as many incidents and as many colors as I can get in there, without having [the story] tip over,” says Gilroy. “I mean, let's be honest, man: The history of civilization, there's a huge arterial component of it that's rape. All of us who are here — we are all the product of rape. I mean armies and power throughout history [have committed rape]. So to not touch on it, in some way … It just was organic and it felt right, coming about as a power trip for this guy. I was really trying to make a path for Bix that would ultimately lead to clarity — but a difficult path to get back to clarity.”


	Asked about Disney's reaction to the scene, Gilroy says he didn't get any studio pushback.

	











	“No one ever ever said anything about it, ever,” Gilroy said. “But I mean, we have limits on what we can do. We are very aware of what we can do sexually and violence wise. Those limits are made very clear.”


	Bix has had a particularly brutal journey on the show so far, having already been captured and tortured by the Imperial Security Bureau during season one, an experience which has left her traumatized.


	Fan reactions have been divided. One major Star Wars fan account wrote, “I don't want to see rape in Star Wars … You can portray power dynamics and making the audience hate the empire in other ways without taking it to such a disgusting place. Vader wouldn't tolerate that shit nor does the Empire condone it. It has no place in Star Wars. Period.” Another pop culture fan account wrote, “I don't mind having mature Star Wars but I'm not ok with it going so far as depicting an attempted rape. Or saying the word ‘rape.' I'm actually quite disgusted with the Andor series right now.”


	While another fan account was one of many that praised the move: “Andor dared to go to the darkest places Star Wars could offer. An Imperial Officer abusing his untouchable status to rape an undocumented migrant, while his troops are rounding up other undocumented citizens. This is the real world seeping into Star Wars storytelling; this is the world WE live in, reflected in the galaxy far, far away, this is Star Wars at its most political, its most potent, its most frightening. I must commend the writing team's bravery to not shy away from such topics. To depict fascist regimes as they are, speak the word ‘rape' directly into the camera, show just how despicable fascists really are. Andor is as brilliant as it is terrifying.”

	











	And yet another fan account pointed out several previous suggestions of sexual servitude in Star Wars — often with scantily clad female characters (Princess Leia on a leash in her famous slave slave bikini in Return of the Jedi being a key example). “Seen some discourse already regarding what happens with Bix in Andor , that kind of thing has happened in Star Wars before except this time they called it what it was,” they wrote. “Adria Arjona played it brilliantly and it was heartbreaking.”


	The episode also featured a rather stunning sequence with Mon Mothma (Genevieve O'Reilly) furiously dancing at her daughter's wedding, even as she knew a man was about to be murdered to protect her secret ties to the Rebel Alliance. The sequence was full of frantic energy and showed a rather different side to the stately senator. 


	“It's my contention that Mon has the hardest road of any character in the whole show,” Gilroy says. “Other people suffer all kinds of sacrifices and all the physical threats. She has to do everything under glass, being examined all the time. She's continually watched. I really wanted to up the stakes there. She's tacitly involved in what will be an assassination and then has go back into the party, which is this joyous event for everybody else, in that kind of chaotic mental state and with that kind of guilt. She's dancing instead of screaming. And what's fascinating there is that there's nobody else in that room except you — the audience — who understands what's happening to her.”

	











	Gilroy also discussed with The Hollywood Reporter another key scene from the first episode, which has a real-life Nazi inspiration. 


Andor is Disney+'s acclaimed Star Wars drama series which currently has the highest rating of any Star Wars TV show or movie on Rotten Tomatoes. The show follows the adventures of Rebel Alliance leader Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and leads up to the events in the film Rogue One. The 12-episode second season will be released in three episode blocks over the next four weeks.

This Is Lorelei's Nate Amos has worked with Snail Mail's Lindsey Jordan to reimagine another song from Box for Buddy, Box for Star. “Two Legs (Snail Mail Version)” will appear alongside MJ Lenderman's rendition of “Dancing in the Club” on a forthcoming expanded edition of Amos' 2024 album. Listen to the new song below.

“When the idea of a deluxe edition with covers/collabs first came up the literal first thought I had was ‘I gotta get Lindsey to sing Two Legs,'” Amos said in a press statement. “I've loved Snail Mail ever since Water From Your Eyes had a chance to tour with them so it was a joy to hear Lindsey bless the song like this.”

Jordan added, “Within the last few years, following Nate's projects, I have come to the conclusion he is the best songwriter of our generation as well as a great guy. Getting to do vocals on this was such a treat because I got to listen to it over and over again.”

Box for Buddy, Box for Star (Deluxe) is out this Friday, April 25. Along with Jordan and Lenderman's contributions, the record also features a new version of “Angel's Eye,” courtesy of Amos' father and sister.

Charles Melton is following in Ryan Gosling's footsteps and collaborating with iconic auteur Nicolas Winding Refn. Melton, who recently starred in Alex Garland's “Warfare,” is set to lead Refn's thriller “Her Private Hell,” as Neon announced. Sophie Thatcher, Kristine Froseth, and Havana Rose Liu are also starring. 

Refn will be writing and directing the feature, which is expected to start shooting this summer. The “Drive” and “Only God Forgives” director who is famously against streaming “content” has partnered with Neon to co-finance and distribute the film. 

 










Refn confirmed in 2024 that he would be making his return to helming features almost a decade after 2016 film “The Neon Demon.” At the time, the unnamed project was announced to be shooting in Tokyo in 2025; it seems this could be “Her Private Hell.”

“It's a really interesting time to make movies because it's such a chaotic situation,” Refn told Variety of the film. “So going back and making a theatrical feature film again is almost like — not starting over — but with all the changes in our societies in the last five years and technology changes, it almost seems like the right thing to do for me.”

While no plot details were revealed at the time, Refn teased that the film “will have a lot of glitter and lot of sex and violence.” As if we'd expect anything else from the auteur…

Refn is also working on a gaming project, as he considers it the “only art form that continues to evolve with possibilities creatively,” adding, “In a way, had the Lumiere brothers, when they invented film, invented computer games first, what would the world look like?” 

However, Refn also said that “feature film is still the mother of all mediums” and with his latest, he's excited to “re-experience that process.” The director continued, “I think it's hard for me to escape my self-indulgent identity in creativity. So there will always be me in it.”

“Her Private Hell” star Melton is a “Riverdale” alum and earned critical acclaim for Todd Haynes' “May December.” In addition to “Warfare,” Melton will appear in “Beef” Season 2. Thatcher, who got her start in “Yellowjackets,” recently led horror films “Companion” and “Heretic.”

In her centennial year, the Cuban singer will be honored with the Legend Award at Billboard's Latin Women in Music gala on April 24.

	Born one hundred years ago in Havana, Cuba, on October 21, 1925, Celia Cruz sang almost before she could talk. The second oldest of 14 children, she could carry a tune at 10 months old, according to her mother, and as a toddler, sang her youngest siblings to sleep. Those bedside moments were the first stage for the woman who would become the single best-known and most influential female figure in the history of Afro Cuban music.  


	By the time she died in 2003 at age 77, Cruz had over 70 albums to her name and had transfixed generations of fans with her mesmerizing stage presence and a signature, rich, expressive contralto that could turn a single word into a masterpiece of a song.

	Cruz was recognized worldwide as much for her extravagant flamboyant outfits, tireless work ethic and colorful wigs as for her trademark cry of “Azúcar!.” But Cruz possessed, above everything, an extraordinary voice. 


	“Forget about getting her behind a mic,” Marc Anthony once told Billboard. “She'll turn anybody out.”


	Indeed, Cruz adamantly refused to lip-sync, even on live TV shows. “I can't go out there and pretend,” she told Billboard in 2000. “In Cuba, I worked with a man named Rodrigo Neira, who was the choreographer of the Tropicana. He wanted a singer to sing and a dancer to dance.”


	Although Cruz's dancing abilities weren't negligible, her voice was incomparable.


	Cruz's recorded legacy is a veritable history of Latin music, from her days with Cuba's legendary La Sonora Matancera to her highly experimental and avant garde later fare, which even mixed urban music with her salsa beats.


	Cruz charted until the day she died, and beyond. More than 20 years after her death, she generated 64 million on-demand official streams in the United States in 2024, according to Luminate. Last year, the U.S. Mint released a commemorative Cruz quarter, the only coin that bears the stamp of a Latin artist. The item joins a list of Cruz memorabilia that includes a stamp, a doll, multiple exhibits, merchandise lines and both a TV series and film in the works, among other projects.


	As a child, Cruz began singing in amateur contests. Her big break came in 1950, when she was called in to replace the lead singer of the legendary La Sonora Matancera, arguably the best salsa band of all time. Cruz gained international acclaim with La Sonora, with whom she remained for 15 years, eventually marrying lead trumpet player Pedro Knight.

	











	Following the Cuban revolution, she settled in New York in 1962 and was never allowed to return to her home country. Cruz's career also flourished stateside, first through her association with Tito Puente's Ticco Records and later with Fania Records.


	Although Cruz remained a popular and venerated figure — she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1987 — she gained a new legion of followers in 2000 after signing with Sony Music Latin, a label that gave her a star treatment until the day she died. With Sony Latin, Cruz won three consecutive Latin Grammy Awards in 2000, 2001 and 2002.


	The secret to her perennial success, she told Billboard, was very basic: “First of all, I take good care of myself. I rest. Second, I plan my shows well. I always try to shape my repertoire around a particular audience. And finally, I'm always changing my outfits, my look onstage.” But at the core of it was her tireless work ethic, and that voice.


	After being diagnosed with cancer in 2002, Cruz made a final trip to the recording studio in February 2003. She recorded for two months and died in July.


	This year, Billboard's Latin Women in Music honors Cruz and her extraordinary life not on the anniversary of her death but in the centennial year of her birth. Cruz will posthumously receive the Legend Award at the gala, which will air April 24 at 9 p.m. ET on Telemundo, and be honored with a musical tribute with performances by Ivy Queen, La India and Olga Tañon.


Billboard spoke to four people who had personal ties to Cruz. Here are their recollections, in their own words.


	Celia was someone who was able to bring our music to this country at a time when women weren't really welcomed in the music industry.

	











	When she joined forces with Fania and Johnny Pacheco, she showed the world what true talent was. And she never changed her musical essence or who she was. She was such an example of humility, perseverance, talent — my God. She became family to us. I was just starting out as a producer, and my dream was always to work with her. But I didn't offer because we were just getting started. We had met, but we hadn't really talked much yet.


	One night, we were playing at the Dupont Plaza, and she asked us to sit at her table. It was like talking to a queen. I remember one time we were performing at the Ovni, and we always played “Quimbara.” She was in the audience, and she came onstage to sing. Our hearts almost burst out of our chests.


	I had the honor of producing several albums for her. One day she called me and said, “I don't have a record label anymore.” And I told her, “I'm going to send you to Sony.” Thank God I called Tommy [Mottola, who] said, “Don't even worry about it. We've got to sign her.” She went into Sony with so much respect. They were going to give her the boost she needed. She passed away with six No. 1 hits. At the time, there was resistance because most of the artists selling records were men. She was one of the women who proved to the world that women could make everyone dance. She was such an inspiration for Gloria [Estefan]. I think we can all learn something from her.


	She and Pedro [Knight] were such humble, kind people who taught us so much. When we were recording, she was so professional. She could almost sing live; she practiced her parts, showed up with humility and was always so proud of her Cuban roots. And the love between her and Pedro… It's rare to work with a couple and see them love each other so much for so many years, being such simple, good people with so much talent.

	











	She was my great teacher. She always remembered to send birthday cards to everyone. Those little thoughtful gestures. She was like a sister to Gloria. She'd come over to eat at our house and was so funny. She'd wash Pedro's shirts and iron them when they were on tour. I'll never forget when I produced the Latin Grammys [for CBS on 2000] — she had terrible knee pain but got up to sing “Quimbara” with Ricky [Martin] anyway. No one could tell what she was going through.


	One day she came to us and said, “I got the big C.” I had no idea what she meant. She called me to help arrange her burial. She told me, “I want every fan I have to be able to say goodbye to me.” She wasn't just loved by Cubans — she was loved by the whole world. She left me one of her dresses, shoes and wig as a thank you, along with a beautiful note for me and Gloria. In a way, I feel at peace knowing I was able to help a woman like her, that I could get her signed to Sony. In these times we're living in, when one person shines, we all shine. And she made all of us shine.


	I met Celia in 1988 through important people in her life. Her nephew was a big fan of mine and he would go see me at the Palladium. He told me he was Celia Cruz's nephew and we didn't believe him. Celia was already a legend. We listened to her music and all the Afro Yoruba-ness around her was really interesting. And of course we all loved La Sonora Matancera.


	One day, she sent a message through him, saying, “Muchas benidiciones en tu show.” (“Many blessings on your show.”) Then in 1990, a year before I decided to cross over from dance to salsa tropical, I was already collaborating with Tito Puente and Tito arranged for us to meet.

	











	We all went to dinner. When I met her, it felt as if we were already family. We spoke about her music, about her. She said she always felt she had a natural ability to sing music with a lot of rhythm. She said, “One thing I notice about you is you study a lot of jazz, but you have a lot of soul. I'd like you to cross over from dance music and do a salsa album.” We sang with prerecorded TV tracks then, and she said, “You need to be up there singing with a live band.”


	She set up a meeting with Ralph Mercado [founder and president of RMM Records, to which Cruz was signed at the time] and said, “Hey, I want you to sign her.”


	We were very close. We talked a lot about music, about the hard labor of a woman. We talked about believing in ourselves, being professional and giving 100% to the music. I found it to be very empowering.


	She used to say, “Yo soy tu madrina musical [“I'm your music godmother],” and she wanted to officially be my godmother. I hadn't had my first communion, and I needed to be baptized.


	She baptized me on Feb. 14, which is the day of friendship and love, and it brought a lot of light into my life, which I needed. I came from a very dysfunctional family, but a very praying family. God was always in our lives. I think that's why it meant so much to me to be baptized with Celia and [husband] Pedro Knight [by my side], and because it meant she would always be in my life. And she was. She was really cute and she wrote telegrams. She had an AT&T calling card and boy, did she use it to the fullest. She called from the airport, when she landed, when she was in her room. Because she was so spiritual, she felt she needed to pray with her goddaughter; that was me. She always prayed before her show. We would hold hands and then we'd go up onstage with her.

	











	We toured together. Everywhere she traveled she was the goddess of the goddesses. She would walk in first, everybody was waiting for her, and we were like little ducks. All of us, me, Marc [Anthony], Cheo [Feliciano], Oscar [D'León], we were all behind her going to all these beautiful places in Europe. She really believed in us. She thought we were coming with talent to bring light to salsa tropical.


	Celia was always an icon, a living legend. She had a lot of vocal control and a beautiful vibrato. Pedro helped her a lot. He quit the trumpet to make sure she was ready to get on that stage and sing her heart out. He was a great partner. She was very lucky to have him.


	In the studio she was a master of great ideas. I gave her a lot of energy, and it was great to have her there with me.


	She always told me that one of the things she liked about me was that she saw my talent and that I didn't have to wear little outfits. We're here as women, as talented women. She would say, “Sabes porqué he tenido exito? Porque yo vendo talento, no vendo sexo.” (“You know why I've been successful? Because I sell talent, not sex.”)


	Now, I see what she meant. It's a male-dominated world, and she wanted respect. She liked being on the road. She liked to take her music to different markets, and she loved shopping. Shopping and music, forget about it. Y su cafecito con su azucar.


	She always tried to encourage the new generation by being positive and working hard. She spoke about the perseverance of hard work, professionalism. Always record, arrive early and have a great orchestra behind you. And all that you get, you give back.

	I knew Celia's work because I studied music in Cuba, but I never got the chance to meet her in person. Since Celia was banned in Cuba, you couldn't hear her on the radio or see her on TV.


	Celia, Willy Chirino, all those artists were prohibited. She was always a defender of freedom.


	After recording “La Gonzadera,” we were trying to figure out how we could use her vocals from “La Negra Tiene Tumbao” in a song. Her digital session recordings from her last recordings were nowhere to be found, but after 10 years of searching with Omer [Perdillo, her manager], we finally found them.


	What we did was mix two songs together, closing it out with “La Negra Tiene Tumbao.”


	But for us, using her voice — can you imagine? As a kid, I'd hear some of her stuff with my dad through videos that had been leaked. Cuba only had two TV channels, and there was a concert she did, I think in Africa, that somehow got through. People had recorded it and we'd watch it. For us, it was such a point of pride. A Cuban woman who was outside of Cuba, yet so huge in the music world — it seemed impossible to reach that level. When I was little, people told me she was a singer who wasn't allowed in Cuba.


	When my dad heard the song, he was blown away. He was like, “How did you pull this off?” And I told him, “Dad, they gave me permission.” This whole story is so nostalgic for every Cuban, given the political situation. Everything feels so deep. In our country, there's so much music, so much art, but it dies there. It's heartbreaking to see so many artists who don't get the chance to share their work. I'm left with this sense of longing because I wasn't able to fully experience her work. And she has incredible songs. Celia was always ahead of the game when it came to music. She was someone who never let herself fall behind.

	











	I met Celia because my dad and an uncle promoted shows in Colombia and they brought José Alberto “El Canario” and Celia together to Buenaventura, Quibdó, and a show in Tuluá that didn't end up happening. But I traveled with her on the same bus from Buenaventura to Tuluá, and I got the chance to talk with her. She said something to my mom about me, and my mom made me sing. I was about 13 or 14 years old.


	I'd seen her on TV, but my dad collected albums and my mom was a huge fan of Celia. I've always been really close to my mom, and in many moments of her life, Celia's music was her soundtrack. “Ritmo, Tambor y Flores” was my first real connection to Celia. One of my aunts made me learn the song, and I sang it the first time I performed in a parade in Condoto. I was about 9 years old, and at my fifth-grade graduation, “Ritmo, Tambor y Flores” was already part of my repertoire. That's the song I sang to her on the bus.


	I went to see her in Buenaventura first. She was wearing white leggings, a shiny top and a short, white wig and she looked amazing. Like, wow — it wasn't often you saw women who could pull off a look like that. I saw music as something totally normal because my mom sang, my uncle brought artists and I'd go to the studios of Grupo Niche. I felt like I was part of the scene.


	So when they said, “Now we're heading to Tuluá on the bus with Celia and “El Canario,” it felt normal. She was traveling with her husband and it was a big, comfy bus. And she said, “What a beautiful little girl. She has something special.”


	My mom told me to sing “Ritmo, Tambor y Flores.” She started singing the chorus, and I sang the second part because I was feeling a little shy. She said, “Keep going, keep going.” And we all started singing together. Imagine that — my skin still tingles thinking about it. It feels like such a normal story, but honestly, it's not that normal. Especially because kids are usually pretty sheltered at that age. Later, when I was 15, I saw her again, and by then, she looked older, and I was so impressed by the respect people had for her and how she kept thriving as an artist, even as someone who was already so established. She was always in the big leagues. What's happening now isn't possible without talking about her. Her story needs to be told.

The pop queen and 'Girls' scribe are co-writing the score and book, respectively, for the adaptation of the beloved teen movie.

	When romantic comedy 10 Things I Hate About You was released in 1999 — a seminal time for the Shakespeare adaptation-as-teen-movie — it was a watershed pop cultural moment. The winning take on The Taming of the Shrew cemented the star power of actors Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and boasted a spunky soundtrack of late-'90s acts like Letters to Cleo, Semisonic and The Cardigans (plus, of course, The Four Seasons; who could forget Ledger's iconic rendition of “Can't Take My Eyes Off You”?).

	Nearly thirty years later, Broadway audiences will see if that magic can be recaptured onstage. Billboard exclusively reveals that 10 Things is being adapted as a musical — with two major creatives keenly attuned to the nuances of young romance onboard. Billboard Hot 100-topping singer-songwriter Carly Jepsen will co-write the score with singer, writer and producer Ethan Gruska (with whom she's collaborated on songs from her latest album, The Loveliest Time, and who's also worked with artists like Bon Iver and Phoebe Bridgers), and Lena Dunham will co-write the book with award-winning playwright Jessica Huang.

	For Jepsen's fans — who may have noticed her frequent presence in New York, and at the theater, on social media in recent months — this news answers long-circulating rumors that she was involved in some percolating Broadway project. This isn't her first big turn in the musical theater realm — she took over the title role in the Broadway production of Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella in 2014 and played Frenchy in Fox's Emmy-winning Grease: Live —  but 10 Things does mark her debut behind-the-scenes, giving her a chance to show off her deeply emotional pop writing and talent for storytelling through song.  Multihyphenate Dunham, whose much-anticipated romcom series Too Much comes to Netflix this year, is also making her debut on a Broadway creative team. 


	Their collaborators, Gruska and Huang, round out a creative team stacked with acclaimed Broadway veterans. 10 Things will be directed and choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon, the former New York City Ballet resident choreographer who rose to the top of the dance world and has since become a formidable theater force, directing and choreographing An American in Paris and MJ: The Musical on Broadway (both Tony-winners). Music supervisor, arranger and orchestrator Tom Kitt is a two-time Tony, two-time Emmy, two-time Grammy and Pulitzer Prize winner known best for writing the hit musical Next to Normal. And producer Mike Bosner has a track record with boundary-pushing, Tony-winning Broadway hits, most recently producing Shucked and making his name as lead producer of Beautiful — The Carole King Musical. (Bosner is producing the musical through a special arrangement with Buena Vista Theatrical.)

	











	An opening date and theater for 10 Things have not yet been announced.

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


	Amazon MGM Studios on Wednesday morning dropped the first trailer for Heads of State, its buddy action comedy reuniting The Suicide Squad‘s John Cena and Idris Elba, which is slated to debut on streaming on July 2.


	Directed by Ilya Naishuller, the filmmaker behind Hardcore Henry (2015) and Bob Odenkirk starrer Nobody (2021), Heads of State is about two government leaders who must set aside their rivalry to thwart a global conspiracy and save the world — if they can work together. Elba plays UK Prime Minister Sam Clarke, with Cena as U.S. President. When the duo become the targets of a powerful and ruthless foreign adversary — who proves more than a match for the two leaders' security forces — they are begrudgingly forced to rely on the only two people they can trust: each other. Along their journey to save the free world, they find a key ally in Noel Bisset, a brilliant MI6 agent played by Priyanka Chopra Jonas.

Barely a year after releasing Ten Fold, Brooklyn singer-songwriter Yaya Bey is returning with another new album: Do It Afraid arrives June 20 via Drink Sum Wtr. The quick follow-up includes the new singles “Dream Girl” and “Wake Up B*tch,” the first of which comes with a music video. Check out both songs below.

Do It Afraid steps into a more dance-heavy direction in Yaya Bey's catalog, as captured in the previously released single “Merlot and Grigio,” featuring Father Philis. Other guests on the album include the rapper and songwriter Rahrah Gabor, the producer Exactly, jazz ensemble Butcher Brown, and vocalist and keyboardist Nigel Hall.

After the album's release in June, Yaya Bey will head out on a headlining tour of the United States. Following a set at Governors Ball Music Festival, the R&B singer will make stops in Philadelphia, Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Seattle, and more cities before wrapping up the short leg on September 27 in Los Angeles.

"I do my best work in the dark," says Jenna Ortega's Wednesday Addams in the first look at the new season. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	It's both a Wednesday and a huge Wednesday news day. 


Netflix has released the first trailer (below) for its highly anticipated second season of the goth-horror-comedy hit, which stars Jenna Ortega as the morbidly inclined Wednesday Addams.




	The streamer has also announced the second season premiere dates, as the show will be released in two batches. The first part will be released Aug. 6 and the second will be released Sept. 3.


	In the trailer, Wednesday returns for a second year at Nevermore Academy, a private school for outcasts. Morticia Addams (Catherine Zeta-Jones) notes her daughter has never wanted to return to school before, and Wednesday deadpans back, “It's like returning to the scene of a crime — I already know where the bodies are buried.” Later in the trailer, she notes, “I do my best work in the dark.”

	The trailer also shows Wednesday reuniting with her spirited roommate Enid (Emma Myers) and shows glimpses of the rest of the Addams clan, including Luis Guzmán as Gomez Addams, Isaac Ordonez as Pugsley Addams and Fred Armisen as Uncle Fester. The trailer also introduces Steve Buscemi as the school's new principal, Barry Dort, and plenty of creepy dolls.


	The production has added series regulars Billie Piper (Scoop), Evie Templeton (Return to Silent Hill), Owen Painter (Tiny Beautiful Things) and Noah Taylor (Law & Order: Organized Crime). Also, there are many familiar names signed on for guest star roles: Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future), Joanna Lumley (Fool Me Once), Thandiwe Newton (Westworld), Frances O'Connor (The Missing), Haley Joel Osment (The Kominsky Method), Heather Matarazzo (The Princess Diaries) and Joonas Suotamo. Lloyd also played Uncle Fester in the 1991 Addams Family film.


	The second season was filmed in Ireland — a change from the first season, which was primarily shot in Romania.


	The first season of Wednesday — from creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar along with executive producer and director Tim Burton — was a smash for the streamer in 2022. Wednesday became the most-viewed English language series in the studio's history, with 252 million views, and spent 20 weeks in the streamer's global Top 10 (Squid Game remains Netflix's biggest hit internationally). The series also catapulted Ortega to a new level of stardom, which was further fueled by her role in Burton's Beetlejuice Beetlejuice last fall.

	Among the oil and gas executives and senior government officials from around the world at the major annual energy conference CERAWeek in Houston last month, one Donald Trump appointee cut an unassuming figure. He stayed at a modest $130/night hotel and was photographed in a gray open-collared shirt and a pair of well-worn tan shoes.


	Little attention has been paid to Thomas Hardy's appointment as acting director of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, or USTDA. It is one of the smallest of the federal agencies and where he has spent the past two decades. But as the much bigger and better-known U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has been gutted, Hardy has quietly been overseeing a reorientation of foreign assistance in Trump's vision for American energy dominance. 


	During the few days he spent in Texas, Hardy spoke at events alongside energy ministers from Turkey and Libya and met with major U.S. fossil fuel companies. He was invited to a cocktail reception hosted by the French oil giant TotalEnergies — the event would be “an opportunity to network with high level oil and gas industry representatives,” according to Hardy's briefing book for the conference, which was obtained by the nonprofit investigative group the Centre for Climate Reporting and Rolling Stone.

	











	As USAID projects designed to help poorer countries transition to cleaner forms of energy have been shuttered, a new brand of international assistance is emerging under Trump: one that benefits America's economic interests as well. That's no more apparent than at USTDA, which funds feasibility and planning studies for major infrastructure projects in emerging economies to spur U.S. jobs and exports. For the past four years, it has focused on clean energy. But now, Hardy's briefing book shows, it is looking to work “in lock step with U.S. industry” to push natural gas around the world. According to the agency, it has already had “tremendous interest.”


	The push could prove lucrative for the companies cashing in on America's gas boom, which have helped the U.S. become the world's biggest producer of fossil fuels and donated millions to reelect Trump. But critics worry that the president's plans to make the U.S. the world's gas station could come at a cost to both Americans and the climate. And for poorer countries who have limited funds for transitioning to cleaner forms of energy, committing to U.S. gas now means that the work of the Trump administration could be felt long after he has left the White House.

	“Trump claimed an ‘energy emergency' but now wants to send more of our energy overseas, which will raise prices for families here, at home,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, the Rhode Island Democrat who is ranking member of the Senate Environment Committee. “The reverse Robin Hood scheme of making Americans pay to enrich fossil fuel billionaires is Trump's modus operandi, and by shutting down more affordable, clean, domestic energy, he is putting us all on the fast track to climate and economic disaster.”


	Even before Trump took office, the U.S. fossil fuel industry was preparing for a huge expansion of its ability to ship gas overseas. Now, with the president vowing to unleash American energy, it has the full support of the government. 


	His Cabinet has extolled the virtues of the oil and gas that Trump has referred to as the “liquid gold under our feet,” as the administration has slashed environmental regulations and opened up federal lands for drilling. Trump has even suggested that countries could buy American-made liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as a way to close trade deficits and avoid steep tariffs. 


	Building on his campaign promise to “drill, baby, drill,” Trump and his Energy Secretary Chris Wright have begun granting new gas export authorizations, which were paused by Joe Biden early last year over fears of driving up prices for Americans and fuelling global warming. Wright, a fracking billionaire, has previously said that the country's abundance of fossil energy could help alleviate poverty around the world while describing concerns about climate change as a “mania.”

	Meanwhile, like many other parts of the U.S. government involved in foreign assistance, USTDA and its roughly 60 members of staff have been in limbo — its funds frozen and work under review. Over the past four years, its activity in the energy sector has focused on renewables and trying to clean up fossil fuels. In December, for instance, the agency announced a partnership with the Egyptian national oil company to help reduce emissions of the greenhouse gas methane. Other examples of initiatives supported by the agency under the Biden administration include a solar power project in Zambia and wind power in Indonesia.


	But the agency's work could look very different under Trump. On the day of his inauguration, USTDA published on its website five ‘success stories' about its work: All five were related to fossil fuels, and all five related to projects it had funded during Trump's first term. There have been no updates on the agency's website or social channels since, other than a post on X and LinkedIn on February 3 announcing that “All USTDA activities are suspended until further notice.” 

	











	But that didn't stop Hardy, who also served as acting director for three years during Trump's first term, from attending CERAWeek in March. He told Reuters on the sidelines of the conference that the agency was already shifting its focus: “Our approach is looking at all energy projects and not being hamstrung by only renewables as happened in the last four years,” he said. His briefing notes from the conference obtained via a FOIA request by CCR suggest that natural gas would be central to its efforts.


	His draft answers for a CERAWeek panel on the African energy sector referenced Trump's executive order on “unleashing American energy” signed on the first day of his second term. 


	“Areas of focus include options for reliable and affordable energy such as oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical minerals, and nuclear energy,” Hardy's notes state. “Of these areas, USTDA anticipates the greatest concentration of its energy sector efforts may be in critical minerals, nuclear energy, and natural gas.”


	As well as his public speaking commitments in Texas, Hardy met with major players in the U.S. gas industry, Cheniere and Excelerate Energy. A planned meeting with ExxonMobil did not go ahead, a spokesperson for the agency said. During the first Trump administration, all three companies participated in USTDA's so-called ‘reverse trade missions,' where the agency invites foreign governments and companies to meet with U.S. industry, according to Hardy's briefing book. 


	He also met with GE Vernova, which works in the renewable energy sector but is a major supplier of turbines for gas-fired power plants. His briefing notes stated that he would “share details about USTDA's planned programming in the energy sector under the Trump administration; and explore areas for collaboration.”


	“We have seen tremendous interest from our partners in emerging markets for support of their natural gas infrastructure,” a USTDA spokesperson told CCR and Rolling Stone. “It is through projects like LNG import terminals and gas-fired power plants that these countries will be able to provide reliable and affordable electricity to their citizens. USTDA is working to make sure that U.S. companies are well positioned to win export deals when emerging markets invest in their energy infrastructure.”


	The briefing book also shows how the first Trump administration had previously sought to use USTDA to specifically boost gas. A memo included in the bundle, titled “Putting American Workers First while Ensuring U.S. Energy Dominance Globally,” mentioned nine USTDA-funded gas projects in countries across the world, including Sierra Leone, India and Vietnam, from Trump's first term. 

	











	“During the Administration of President Donald J. Trump, USTDA prioritized an all-of-the-above energy strategy to open emerging markets for the export of U.S.-manufactured goods and services,” the memo stated. “Core to this focus was ensuring countries had the ability and capacity to import U.S.-produced LNG, making the United Sates [sic] an indispensable partner for energy production.” It added that “this commitment to energy development” led to over $1 billion in U.S. exports.


	His notes state that the agency plans to “coordinate with the U.S. gas industry to launch an updated version of this initiative so that we can address their current and longer-term needs.”


	Dr. Robert Howarth is a professor at Cornell University whose research informed the decision by the Biden administration to pause approvals of new LNG export licenses in January last year. He found that emissions may be much higher than previously expected. 


	“We need to be reducing our emissions from fossil fuels by half in the next 15 years or so if we're going to avoid catastrophic runaway climate disruption. But here we are exporting LNG which has the largest footprint,” he said.


	It would be “tragic” for the climate if countries such as Vietnam — where USTDA's work during Trump's first term helped “U.S. industry to supply technology for natural gas power plants,” according to Hardy's briefing book — build out LNG infrastructure because of pressure from the U.S., he said. “The world simply can't afford to increase our use of fossil fuels.”


	A spokesperson for USTDA did not directly answer questions about the potential impact the agency's work could have on the climate or whether it would continue to support renewable energy projects. The agency will “align its programming” with Trump's Executive Order on Unleashing American Energy but it is still under review, she said. “Any resumption of program funding will fully align with the Administration's foreign policy priorities for making America safer, stronger and more prosperous, including in the energy sector.”


	The vision for a second Trump term as written last year by the coalition of conservative groups known as Project 2025 included calls to “scale back USAID's global footprint” and “deradicalize” its programs. Of particular ire to the group was “the Biden Administration's extreme climate policies” and “its anti-fossil fuel agenda.”

	











	“The next conservative Administration should rescind all climate policies from its foreign aid programs,” it wrote in its Mandate for Leadership, the book published by the group.


	Despite distancing himself from Project 2025 during the campaign, Trump's gutting of USAID over recent months has largely followed this plan. More than 150 climate and clean energy contracts and grants managed by the agency have been terminated, according to an analysis by Politico's E&E News. 


	The moves will have likely been cause for concern for those at USTDA. Project 2025 wrote that Congress should “eliminate” the agency, stating that its “activities more properly belong to the private sector.”


	But a pivot to fossil fuels could show that USTDA is a valuable tool for an administration looking for a more transactional approach to international development. Its small team, which has staff in D.C. and in U.S. embassies across the world, can have a mighty impact: For every dollar it spends on programming, it generates on average $231 in U.S. exports.


	A memo apparently being circulated by Trump aides suggests USTDA could be placed under the auspices of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Politico reported last month. Rather than providing grants, DFC oﬀers loans, makes investments, and provides insurance against political risks for private sector-led projects in lower and middle-income countries. The proposed plan is part of a broader retooling of overseas aid to “create a performance-based, transactional model.”


	“This blueprint proposes a reimagined U.S. international assistance structure and set of operating principles that promises measurable returns to America while also projecting American soft power; enhancing our national security; and countering global competitors, including China,” the memo states. But there are questions about what the countries would get from U.S. aid focused on building out LNG import infrastructure and gas-fired power plants. 


	The industry has claimed that cheap, reliable LNG can be used as a transitional fuel for countries looking to move away from coal. But Sam Reynolds, a research lead at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said that for many countries, it does not make financial sense to import U.S. LNG, regardless of the consequences for the climate. He said that the cost of generating electricity from imported LNG is “orders of magnitude more expensive than renewables.”

	











	In many cases, “there simply is no economic case to use LNG as a bridge fuel,” he said.

	But he warned that pressure from the Trump administration on countries to buy U.S. gas could lead to “transactional LNG relationships rather than relationships based on sound economics. They're based on security and fear and a need to assuage the current administration.”

Among the many celebrities paying tribute to Pope Francis is “American Idol” judge Lionel Richie, who opened up about the “wonderful” meeting he had with the leader of the Catholic Church in 2019. 

On April 21, 2025, the Vatican confirmed the Pope had died of a cerebral stroke on Easter Monday, per the Associated Press. He was 88. 

Later that day, Richie took media questions after judging the two-hour, live “American Idol” episode during which he, Carrie Underwood, and Luke Bryan made their final picks for the top 14. He looked pained when a reporter from Extra asked about the “sad news” that Pope Francis had died, and then shared why their meeting was so special to him. 

A post shared by LisaParigi 陳 (@lisaparigi)

Richie met Pope Francis in December 2019 when he, “Britain's Got Talent” alum Susan Boyle, and 80s singer Bonnie Tyler were invited to the Vatican to perform a Christmas concert with an underlying theme of environmentalism, according to Rome Report. 

While there, Richie posted a photo of himself on Facebook and wrote, “Not every day you get to have an audience with the Pope at the Vatican.” Boyle also posted a Facebook photo of her with Richie and Tyler, noting that their concert would raise money for the Amazon rainforest. 

Recalling that day, Richie told Extra, “I had the wonderful pleasure of meeting him. (He was) warm, accessible, they kept trying to say to him, ‘Uh, you need to be over here.' He walks out … walks off stage and into the crowd! And when he walks up to you, it's as if he knows you.” 

“I meet a lot of people every day, every night,” Richie continued. “(But) he does it every day — masses of people! And when he's speaking to you — he spoke to my party, me, as if we've been friends for the longest time.” 

“I'm going to miss him,” Richie told Extra, “because he was in touch. You can say what you want to say, but he was in touch with a common person. Didn't matter what part of the world you're from, he knew how to relate. And my philosophy has always been, as my grandmother would say, ‘If you know how to treat somebody in Alabama, it applies around the world.'” 

“He came from Italy,” Richie added, “but he knew how to talk to everybody around the world.”

On April 21, Richie's longtime love Lisa Parigi posted throwback photos of them with Pope Francis at the event and wrote, “There are moments that stay with you forever—this is one of them. 🤍 Feeling so blessed. #popefrancis”

Richie is not Catholic, but was raised as a Christian in Tuskegee, Alabama.  

In 2012, he told The Guardian, “God is wherever I am. I was born and raised a Christian, but I've learned from my travels that God has many names. When you see yourself as a citizen of the world, then you respect where you are. Buddha, Allah, and Jesus all lead to the same thing – a higher consciousness.”

When he left for college, he told People in 2019, he thought he might become an Episcopal priest — until he discovered music and girls.  

“I left my mom and dad's house to go to Tuskegee University, and I met my Commodore friends there,” he told the outlet. “At the time I was seriously considering being an Episcopal priest. (But) the first time I played with the Commodores, a group of girls screamed. Up until that moment no one, no girl had ever screamed at me.” 

Richie opened the three-hour “American Idol” Easter special on April 20 by singing his 2009 song “Eternity,” backed by the top 24 contestants. Joking to Extra that he was “Reverend Richie” for a moment, he said he loved getting to start the show with such a meaningful message. 

“When they asked me to do it first, I was honored,” he told the outlet. “That song has been in my catalog for a while and I said, ‘Okay, let's pull that out.' And I've received so many people saying ‘Where'd that song come from?!'”

That gum you like is going to come back in style — and on MUBI.

Thirty-five years after “Twin Peaks” premiered, and just months after late auteur and series co-creator David Lynch died at age 78, the series in all its entirety will stream on MUBI this June.

Lynch and Mark Frost co-created cult classic show “Twin Peaks,” which premiered in 1990 on ABC. The second season aired in 1991 before being canceled by the network; it was later revived in 2017 at Showtime with “Twin Peaks: The Return,” a limited event series. All seasons will come to MUBI starting June 13, with all 30 episodes of “Twin Peaks” and all 18 parts of “Twin Peaks: The Return” on the platform.

The first two seasons of “Twin Peaks” followed FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) as he investigates the murder of homecoming queen Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) in the border town of Twin Peaks. 




			Popular on IndieWire		






MacLachlan, as well as many other members of the ensemble cast, reprised their respective roles for “Twin Peaks: The Return.” Lynch directed the entire 18-part limited event series, which was set 25 years after Laura Palmer's murder.

“Twin Peaks” is written and executive produced by Lynch and Frost, with Sabrina S. Sutherland executive producing. The series is distributed by Paramount Global Content Distribution. 

Both iterations of the series will still remain on the Paramount+/Showtime platform in addition to streaming on MUBI. A representative for MUBI told IndieWire that the deal between MUBI and Paramount Global was specifically made for “Twin Peaks.” The series will be available on MUBI in the following territories: US, LATAM, TR, NL, IN, UK/IE, DE, IT. 

“Twin Peaks” star MacLachlan previously said during Canneseries 2024 that the cast all “recognized how weird ‘Twin Peaks' was” upon its 1990 debut. “We didn't think it would get past ‘one and done,'” MacLachlan said of the first season, “and thought it might become a movie of the week but said that we had to be part of it because it is David Lynch.”

Lynch did in fact originally plan for film “Mulholland Drive” to be a sequel set within the world of “Twin Peaks,” however the idea was abandoned. The style of “Twin Peaks” would in part define the term Lynchian in reference to Lynch's tone and aesthetic. 

 










“Launching ‘Twin Peaks' alongside ‘Twin Peaks: A Limited Event Series' is a dream for MUBI, bringing one of the most loved and discussed series in TV history to the platform,” Katharina Feistauer, VP Global Head of Programming, MUBI, said. “Whilst this launch has been months in the making, the sad news of David Lynch's death only a few weeks ago makes this opportunity to show his iconic work even more special. We are excited for the Lynch fans in our membership to revisit the episodes comprehensively, as well creating an opportunity for new audiences to discover it for the first time.” 

MUBI is a global film distributor, streaming service, and production company.

Former “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Lisa Vanderpump is sharing her support for Garcelle Beauvais following her recent decision to exit the Bravo series.

While speaking to TMZ in April 2025, Vanderpump, who exited RHOBH following the show's 9th season, said Beauvais is “a wonderful woman.”

“I'm sure she's kind of moving on to other things. It kind of served her well, and I wish her lots of luck,” said Vanderpump to the publication. 

Vanderpump made similar comments about Beauvais' exit during an April 2025 interview with Us Weekly. She said she would continue to not watch RHOBH, especially now that Beauvais has left the Bravo series. 

“There's no upside for me watching it. The only one I really liked was Garcelle [Beauvais] — I have a good relationship with her. Now it's time for her to move on. She was somebody before and she'll be somebody after. Not everybody's like that. A lot of people are defined by Housewives,” said Vanderpump during the Us Weekly interview.

During the April 2025 interview with TMZ, Vanderpump said she would not come back to RHOBH. 

“That's a hard no,” said Vanderpump to TMZ. 

Vanderpump made similar comments about possibly returning to RHOBH while speaking to Us Weekly in April 2025. She said she would not come back to the Bravo franchise unless there were changes made to its cast. 

“That's a hard no, unless it was a group of different women I really liked,” said Vanderpump in the Us Weekly interview. 

Vanderpump also gave her opinion about RHOBH during a December 2024 interview with Access Hollywood. She said she would not consider coming back to the series. In addition, she gave an update on her dynamic with her former friend and castmate, Kyle Richards. According to Vanderpump, she would not mend her friendship with Richards unless she received an apology.

According to BravoTV.com, Beauvais revealed she would no longer film for RHOBH in a March 2025 Instagram video. 

“I have some news: I've decided to leave Beverly Hills. It's been a wild ride — I mean, some amazing things have happened, and some hard things have also happened — but it's been a ride nevertheless,” said Beauvais while filming the video. 

She said one of the reasons she left RHOBH following season 14 was because she wanted to spend time with her younger sons, Jaid and Jax.  

“Their last year of high school is next year and I want to be a part of that. And Jaid is starting a new [modeling] career and I want to be a part of that too,” said Beauvais. 

She also said she has been busy working as an actress and producer. 

“Secondly, I have the most exciting projects that I am developing, producing, and acting in. I can't tell you anything right now, but you'll know soon,” said Beauvais in her Instagram video.

The revered hip-hop supergroup will celebrate 25 years of their self-titled debut on a run of North American tour dates.

	As Deltron 3030 reportedly prepare the release of their long-awaited third album, they'll first be taking a look back at their debut, performing the record in full on their upcoming North American tour.

	The revered hip-hop supergroup – comprising rapper Del the Funky Homosapien (aka Deltron Zero), producer Dan the Automator (the Cantankerous Captain Aptos) and turntablist Kid Koala – will be returning to the live stage this summer, launching a 16-date tour in Vancouver, BC on July 18 before traveling throughout the U.S. and Canada over the next three months.

	The tour will see Kid Koala pulling double duty as he opens the shows alongside Lealani, while the main event will see Deltron 3030 performing their self-titled debut album in full.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Originally released in May 2000, Deltron 3030 didn't reach dizzying commercial heights, instead peaking at No. 194 on the Billboard 200 and No. 18 on the Independent Albums charts. However, it was highly-regarded by critics, with the hip-hop concept album pairing stark social commentary with tongue-in-cheek humour as atmospheric beats accompanied narratives of dystopian society in the year 3030.


	Deltron 3030 were largely inactive in the years following their debut album's release, though they would re-emerge in 2013 with a sequel record titled Event 2. The album would hit No. 41 on the Billboard 200 and reach No. 6 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, with the group touring in earnest in the following years. 


	Currently, the release of a 2016 live album (fittingly-titled Live) is the group's latest commercial release, though Deltron 3030 have hinted towards a third studio LP in previous years. Alongside news of their forthcoming tour, it's been confirmed that a new record is indeed in the works, though it's likely that fans will have to wait until the completion of their live commitments before new material or updates arrive.

"Kneecap, an Irish rap group, took their performance to a different level by incorporating aggressive political statements," Osbourne wrote in a lengthy social media post.

Sharon Osbourne has shared her disdain of Northern Irish hip-hop trio Kneecap and the outspoken messaging present in their recent Coachella set, going so far as to call for the revocation of their work visas.

	Osbourne shared her comments on social media on Tuesday (April 22), days after Kneecap played the second weekend of the Coachella festival. The Friday (April 18) performance drew recognition for the band's use of strong anti-Israel sentiments during their set – sentiments which they had claimed were censored during their first weekend appearance.

	“Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,” the projected messages read. “It is being enabled by the U.S. government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes. F–k Israel; free Palestine.” 




			Trending on Billboard		







	These messages weren't the only pro-Palestinian sentiments shared during the 2025 edition of the festival. Notably, Green Day altered lyrics to reflect the plight of Palestinian children, while names such as Bob Vylan and Blonde Redhead displayed Palestinian flags during their sets. In the case of the latter, the onstage event was soundtracked by audio of Mahmoud Khalil – the detained Columbia University graduate student currently being held in an immigration detention center following his role in on-campus protests.


	However, Osbourne shared a lengthy response to the apparent politicisation of Coachella, noting that this year's edition will be remembered “as a festival that compromised its moral and spiritual integrity.”


	“Goldenvoice, the festival organizer, facilitated this by allowing artists to use the Coachella stage as a platform for political expression,” she wrote. “At a time when the world is experiencing significant unrest, music should serve as an escape, not a stage for political discourse. 


	“While festivals like Coachella showcase remarkable talent from around the globe, music's primary purpose is to unite people. It should not be a venue for promoting terrorist organizations or spreading hate.”


	As Osbourne continued, she noted that despite being a fan of Saturday headliners Green Day, she felt that their own views of events in the Middle East would have been more appropriate if shared “at their own concert, not at a festival.” Kneecap's sentiments, however, were deemed so egregious that she closed by asking supporters to join in her “advocating for the revocation of Kneecap's work visa.”

	











	“Kneecap, an Irish rap group, took their performance to a different level by incorporating aggressive political statements,” Osbourne wrote. “Their actions included projections of anti-Israel messages and hate speech, and this band openly support terrorist organizations. 


	“This behavior raises concerns about the appropriateness of their participation in such a festival and further shows they are booked to play in the USA. Reports indicate that Goldenvoice was unaware of Kneecap's political intentions when they were booked. However, after witnessing their performance during the first weekend, allowing them to perform again the following weekend suggests support of their rhetoric and a lack of due diligence.”


	In the wake of Kneecap's performance, Goldenvoice CEO Paul Tollett reportedly claimed he was “blindsided” by the band's actions. While HYBE America CEO and former talent manager Scooter Braun – who previously staged exhibits in Los Angeles and Israel about the October 7, 2023 attacks in Israel – defended Tollett, Osbourne expressed disbelief that anyone who attended exhibits such as Braun's could book an artist such as Kneecap for the festival.


	“Furthermore, the Independent Artists Group, which represents Kneecap, includes individuals of Jewish heritage,” she continued. “It is disheartening that they have not used their positions to prevent the promotion of such controversial messages. Shame on them. 


	“As someone with both Irish Catholic on my Mothers side and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage on my Fathers side, and extensive experience in the music industry, I understand the complexities involved,” she added. “Goldenvoice's claim of being ‘blindsided' by Kneecap's performance seems implausible given the circumstances. I know for a fact that certain people in the industry had written to Goldenvoice, airing their concerns around the booking of Kneecap.”

	











	For their part, Kneecap have not responded directly to the criticism of their messaging, instead sharing examples of the myriad supportive messages they have received in the wake of their Coachella sets. The group will return to North America in October for another run of live dates.

Lorde debuted her forthcoming new single, “What Was That,” on Tuesday evening, April 22, at New York's Washington Square Park. The singer stood on a wooden platform at the center of the park's now-dormant fountain and sang along to the track as it played from a minimal speaker stack, according to footage shared online. Watch a clip on X.

Earlier today, Lorde teased the pop-up appearance with a message shared via her fan text line: “Meet me in the park Tonight 7pm -xx.” When 7 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time rolled around, she followed up with a post to her Instagram story, informing attendees that the event had been shut down by park rangers and local police. “I am truly Amazed by how many of you showed up !!!” it read, in part. “But they're telling me you gotta disperse … I'm so sorry.”

Much of the crowd stuck around for the next hour, however, until Blood Orange's Devonté Hynes—who is speculated to have worked on Lorde's next album—arrived with a rolling speaker blasting “What Was That” and led them out of the park. Lorde finally showed up after 9 p.m., pausing to thank the assembled fans before launching into her song. Newly revealed lyrics include the following: “I'm missing you/And all the things we used to do/MDMA in the back garden, blow our pupils up/We kissed for hours straight but baby, what was that?/I remember saying then/This is the best cigarette of my life/Well I want you just like that.”

Lorde first teased “What Was That” via a snippet posted to TikTok, accompanied by a video of her strutting around Washington Square Park. She recently made an appearance at Charli XCX's weekend one Coachella set and collaborated with New Zealand singer-songwriter Marlon Williams. Her latest studio album to date is 2021's Solar Power.

"The cops are shutting us down I am truly Amazed by how many of you showed up !!!" the singer wrote on social media.

Lorde has given fans in New York City a preview of her new single after plans for an in-person event fell by the wayside thanks to local law enforcement.


	The New Zealand singer is currently preparing to launch new single “What Was That” on Friday (April 25), with the track serving as her first piece of solo music since 2021. The first taste of her upcoming fourth album, Lorde initially teased the single with her first-ever post on TikTok, sharing a video of herself walking through Washington Square Park in New York City while listening to the dreamy synth-pop track.

	In lieu of traditional social media updates, Lorde has since taken to connecting with fans by way of text messages and voice notes, with her legions of supporters receiving a message on Tuesday (April 22) which told fans to “meet me in the park” at 7pm.




			Trending on Billboard		







	As a result, fans flooded to Washington Square Park to hopefully catch a glimpse of the musician, though the gathered masses were soon urged to leave by local law enforcement. 


	Lorde took to her Instagram Stories soon after to address those who had turned out for the last-minute affair. “Omg @thepark the cops are shutting us down I am truly Amazed by how many of you showed up !!!” she wrote. “But they're telling me you gotta disperse … I'm so sorry.”


	According to Rolling Stone, a spokesperson for New York City's DCPI stated that officers had been alerted to an “unscheduled event” within the park, adding that a “sound and parks permit” is required to hold a concert event in a NYC park. “This individual did not possess either,” the statement added. “Organizers of the event were informed they could not perform and they left the location.”


	Fans who remained within Washington Square Park were rewarded for their patience, however, with the singer later showing up to play her new single. Though Lorde didn't perform the track live, she danced along to “What Was That” while it was being played by producer Dev Hynes of Blood Orange fame.


	Lorde's appearance in New York City comes just over a week after she made a surprise appearance during Charli XCX's Coachella set to guest on a performance of “Girl, So Confusing.”


	With her new single set to arrive in a matter of days, Lorde's new era is fast-approaching, telling fans in her recent voice note that “everything is about to change.” She added, “These are the last moments where it's just us, which is crazy. But so right. I'm so ready.”

AriGameplays always knew she wanted to be a performer. The Mexican streamer, who has amassed over 7 million subscribers on Twitch playing everything from Fortnite to Roblox, remembers being a young girl performing for her family at holidays and wanting to be a star.


	“It was an idea that was replaying in my head,” she tells Rolling Stone over Zoom from her streaming setup at home. “This is me being loyal to myself as a little girl.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Following a live event in her native Monterrey, Mexico on Tuesday, where she officially launched her music career in front of hundreds of fans, the Latina gamer officially premieres the colorful video for her debut single “Pilates” with Rolling Stone.


	“The song is about empowering the girls. And it's very pink!” she says. “‘Pilates' is very pink, and I feel like it goes with the whole design of my world. I want it to put fans in the mood — even if you're having a bad day, I want it to pull you out of that. “


	In gaming, AriGameplays has built a devoted fanbase thanks to her Twitch streams with games such as Minecraft, Fortnite, Grand Theft Auto, and Overwatch. She ranks in the top 30 of most-followed Twitch streamers in the world, and leads the list of Spanish-speaking women on the platform.

	











	In her music, Bela doesn't take herself too seriously. The campy, pastel-toned music video for “Pilates” follows her as a doll living in a colorful tropic world as she sings about yachts and matcha lattes, dropping Spanglish refrains like “in my baddie era” along the way on the poppy track.


Rolling Stone recently spoke to Aria Bela about her music launch, Sabrina Carpenter's skin in Fortnite, and what's next for her:


How was it for you to decide to transition into music? Walk me through it. I was being loyal to myself as a little girl, who always liked to do shows, dance, sing. It's something that I've always liked, and music, after all, lives with me every day. It was another way to be able to connect more with my fans, because they can listen to me everywhere, in the car, wherever they want to be.

Do you think your fans are expecting music from you?I just released the teaser, and I put a little bit of everything in there for people to come up with ideas. There are a lot of people who think I'm going to release merch, do makeup, or start a Pilates studio. The people who guessed music are very excited.

	











How did you start making music? I've been taking classes for more than two years, because I really wanted to do things right. Then I met Mechi Pieretti on TikTok. She's an artist, she's a singer, and she's also a composer. And we connected so well. The truth is that it's been a really fun process. It made me feel really confident. I write with her. We've had a really great girl power, where we've made things work pretty well. I've been very involved in my musical process, in my songs, in my videos, in the concepts of my songs. And I think that when you listen to it, it makes a lot of sense. It's my world.


Tell me about “Pilates” and its video. What was the inspiration for it, and how did you come up with the concept?Well, I love Pilates, to start. I was lucky enough to participate in [amateur boxing event] La Velada del Año several years ago. And things changed from zero to 100 for me, to start exercising, because I didn't before. And when I finished boxing, I said, “What am I going to do now?” And that's when I met Pilates. It fascinated me. It's 40 minutes, where you feel good with yourself, where you work out for yourself. And I think that's exactly what the single is, empowering the girls. And it's very pink. Pilates is very pink, and I feel like it goes with the whole design of my world.

Obviously, making the transition from a streamer to creating music can bring a lot of questions. How do you plan to respond to those people?It definitely makes me nervous. Something new always makes me nervous. And obviously, I guess there's going to be a lot of expectations, a lot of comments. I imagine they'll be good and bad. But I have a lot of confidence in what I'm doing. I've done it with a lot of love. And I think it's actually good. When you believe in yourself, you just need people to join you, to like you, to share with you, to connect with you. And for people who don't watch AriGameplays, they can connect with Aria instead.

A post shared by ARIGAMEPLAYS 🍓 (@arigameplays)


On the music side, what inspires you? What artists and what kind of songs?Well, the truth is that I've always been a popera, a pop girl. I definitely look to make pop. I feel like we need more pop in Mexico. So I really like knowing that I'm going to get in there. Obviously, I love other genres. So a lot of my songs are a mix of various things with pop. But that's mainly it. I grew up with Belinda. And I love that she still makes music. I still love what she does. And also Kenia Os, who I know is doing very well right now.

	











What do you think of the artists who are doing the opposite of you? For example, Sabrina Carpenter released her skin on Fortnite. What do you think of the crossover between music and gamers?It's crazy. I love it. It's been several years since Travis Scott released his Fortnite skin. I thought it was really cool. At the end of the day, it's the best of both worlds. And that's really good. I like that singers are trying to transition to this gaming world, which is huge. And I hope they can receive me as well now.


Love that. What's your plan with the music?I'm working on a lot of music. I already have a lot of songs that are coming out. I think that in about two weeks, a month, you will be getting to know another song and then another song. I also have a lot of love for them, and I know that people are going to like them a lot. They are all very different, but at the end of the day, they are still in the same line of pop and Aria Bela.

How would you describe your personality and what's something people may not know about you?Whenever I have to describe myself, I get nervous. I would say that I'm very happy. I radiate a lot of energy. I'm going to repeat, pink. I'm a very pink person, and very sentimental. I hope that when people listen to my songs, they can feel what I'm trying to convey.


I saw you were at Coachella, right?Yes, I loved seeing Lady Gaga, I also liked Post Malone, the Mexican artists, too. I enjoyed Junior H, I saw a bit of everything, and I loved it. Coachella was a great festival; it was my second year there, and it's really nice to have all kinds of music, and all the fandoms, and communities of people who like different genres in one place, living and sharing. It's incredible.

	As Elon Musk shreds the federal workforce and threatens America's core safety-net, his buddy in the White House, Donald Trump, has been leading the American economy into a recession with his escalating trade war. Now, Musk and Tesla are feeling the financial burn — and the world's richest man is lashing out.


	During a call with investors Tuesday, Musk blamed “paid” and “very organized” protesters for his electric company's remarkably weak earnings so far in 2025. “They're obviously not going to admit that the reason that they're protesting is because they're receiving fraudulent money, or that they're the recipients of wasteful largesse, they're gonna come up with some other reason, but that is the real reason for the protests,” said the billionaire.


	Tesla's quarterly earnings plummeted by 71 percent compared to last year, the company reported Tuesday, as the electric vehicle company saw a 9 percent decline in revenue year over year. Its total earnings were down from $1.4 billion in the first quarter of last year to $409 million in the first quarter this year, the company stated. Tesla's income was offset by selling $595 million in zero-emissions tax credits, per its earnings report, which helped the company avoid a loss.

	











	“Uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers,” Tesla stated in an earnings presentation. “This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term.”


	The changing political sentiment, of course, has a lot to do with Musk's gleeful firing of tens of thousands of federal workers in the name of alleged cost savings made by his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), as well as his amplification of white nationalists on X — and the straight-armed salute he made during Trump's post-inauguration rally. Musk and DOGE have slashed the agency that manages Social Security, as he's falsely criticized America's core safety-net program as a “Ponzi scheme.”

	Musk, who poured $290 million into efforts to elect Trump and Republicans, has seen Tesla become a political lightning rod, with protestors taking out their frustrations over DOGE on his electric vehicle company. Trump, the man he helped elect, has launched a global economic trade war and refuses to let up on China, which has retaliated against his import taxes of 145 percent, countering with 125 percent. 

	











	During Tuesday's call, however, Musk continued to avoid taking responsibility for the political nightmare he created for his company. He instead touted DOGE's “progress in addressing waste and fraud,” and reiterated his commitment to “working together with President Trump and his administration, because if the ship of America goes down, you'll go down with it, including Tesla and everyone else.”


	Musk said that while he will begin scaling back from his work with the White House “probably in May,” he expects to continue working with the Trump administration for the remainder of the president's term. He added that he will begin spending more time on Tesla affairs starting next month.


	Tesla backlash is at an all-time high, whether acted on through bumper stickers and peaceful protests or torched vehicles and vandalized company facilities. As calls for boycotts against Tesla have spread across the globe, sales have plummeted across the board, and the company's latest product, the stainless steel-paneled Cybertruck, has been a flop.

	However, Musk ended his call on an optimistic note despite the public displeasure with his work alongside Trump and plunging Tesla profits. “I continue to believe that Tesla, with excellent execution, will be the most valuable company in the world,” said Musk. “By far.”


	“We're not on the ragged edge of death, not even close,” he added.

"He is doing well and is looking forward to coming back to San Antonio soon as well as continuing his US Tour," Santana's manager said Tuesday. 


							By 

	Ethan Millman


Music Editor


Carlos Santana postponed a concert in San Antonio Tuesday night after the legendary guitarist was hospitalized for dehydration, a rep for Santana confirmed Tuesday. 


	Santana was slated to play San Antonio's Majestic Theatre this evening, but his manager, Michael Vrionis, said he was taken in for observation after suffering an incident while prepping for the show, and doctors determined Santana was suffering from dehydration.




	“Out of an abundance of caution and the health of Mr. Santana, the decision to postpone the show was the most prudent course of action,” Vrionis said. “He is doing well and is looking forward to coming back to San Antonio soon as well as continuing his US Tour. Thank you all very much for your understanding. The show will be rescheduled soon.”

	Santana's reps are advising ticket holders to hang onto their tickets, stating they'd have more information on the rescheduled date as soon as possible. Other than Tuesday's show, Santana also has shows slated this week for Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. Santana's team didn't specify whether the incident would impact any of those upcoming shows as well.


	The cancellation comes less than a week after Santana started the Oneness Tour 2025 at Yaamava' Theater in Highland, California, on April 16. He played two more shows as well at the Talking Stick Resort Amphitheatre in Phoenix on April 18, and at the Isleta Amphitheater in Albuquerque on April 19.


	This isn't the first time Santana has postponed shows over dehydration. He collapsed on stage back in 2022, subsequently canceling six concerts, as Vrionis said Santana was recovering from heat exhaustion.

In the world of wrestling entertainment, things don't always go according to plan. Whether it's a wrestler missing their cue or the referee botching counts, keeping all the various storylines and outrageous antics in check can be difficult. 

At night 2 of WWE‘s WrestleMania 41, “Stone Cold” Steve Austin came out on his ATV, like he's done numerous times in the past. But this time, the WWE Hall of Famer's joyride came to an abrupt end as he lost control and drove straight into a barrier.

A post shared by Uncrowned (@uncrowned)

The crowd at Allegiant Stadium was overjoyed at the sound of shattering glass on the speakers. This signaled the arrival of WWE legend “Stone Cold” Steve Austin. The sold-out stadium cheered wildly as he drove his four-wheeler out and cruised around the ring several times. Unfortunately, one of his corner turns was way too wide, and he crashed straight into the ringside barrier. 

A woman was seen on video standing in front of the blockade, celebrating Austin's arrival with everyone else. After he hit the barrier, she was knocked backward. TMZ reported that the woman looked furious, but others alleged that she was overreacting.

“She did the best work of the night, how she fall seconds after the thing already hit the barricade?” One X user posted. “She sold that fall better than the entire AEW roster,” another fan wrote.

After the crash, Austin leaned forward and said something to the fan before hopping up onto the stage. While Austin was on stage, he announced the Sunday attendance of 63,226. He then claimed that there must have been more people there. He slowly began counting the crowd himself, but only made it to 18 before he gave up. 

While Austin chugged a couple of cans of beer on stage, WWE President Khan came over to check on the woman. Upon exiting the ring, Austin stopped to talk to her again. 

Austin was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on Saturday night. It was his second induction, as he had been inducted for the first time in 2009. This time, he received the honor for the “Immortal Moments” category, in recognition of his WrestleMania 13 match against Bret Hart.

The main event on Sunday was the match between John Cena and Cody Rhodes. Cena made history by winning the match and his 17th championship title.

Lanterns has been filming for a while at this stage, but we have word on yet another late addition to the cast of the DC Studios/HBO series.

Deadline reports that veteran actor Paul Ben-Victor (Nobody Wants This) is set for a key recurring role as Antaan, "an extraterrestrial devoted to exposing the truth and exacting vengeance against those who wronged his people. Consumed by a deep and unrelenting hatred for the law, he is determined to deliver justice on his own terms."

Antaan isn't an established DC Comics character, and based on the description above, there's speculation that Ben-Victor could actually be playing Atrocitus.

Introduced in Green Lantern vol. 4 #25 back in 2008, Atros witnessed the deaths of his wife and children when the rogue Manhunters laid waste to Space Sector 666. Renaming himself "Atrocitus", he and four survivors formed a terrorist cabal known as the Five Inversions, who made it their mission to destroy the Guardians of the Universe and all who served them.

There's always a chance this Antaan is an original character created for the show, but it would seem like an odd move when Atrocitus' backstory and motivations are so similar.



This is who I was teasing when I said there would be another villain in Lanterns. I believed he would be Atrocitus but they're still referring to him as Antaan. Also I know they wanted to cast a tall actor but he's is 5'7. Not sure if it's Atrocitus in disguise or an OC https://t.co/7FkndNZbKi

We recently got a first official look at Lanterns via a promo still featuring Kyle Chandler as Hal Jordan and Aaron Pierre as John Stewart, which you can check out below.

James Hawes (Slow Horses, Penny Dreadful, The Mist, The Alienist, Snowpiercer) will helm the first two episodes. The creative team also includes Emmy Award-winning Lost and Watchmen creator Damon Lindelof, and comic book writer Tom King. Justin Britt-Gibson, Breannah Gibson and Vanessa Baden Kelly are also on board.
The cast also includes Kelly MacDonald, Poorna Jagannathan, Jasmine Cephas Jones and Ulrich Thomsen, who will play the villainous Sinestro.
Garrett Dillahunt is reportedly playing the villainous William Macon, who is described as "a self-righteous, conspiracy-minded man who masks his ruthless ambition behind a charming and calculated facade." There's some speculation that he will ultimately be unveiled as an established DC Comics baddie, possibly even Black Hand.
Lanterns "follows new recruit John Stewart and Lantern legend Hal Jordan, two intergalactic cops drawn into a dark, earth-based mystery as they investigate a murder in the American heartland.".
"This is a story of a couple of Green Lanterns John Stewart and Hal Jordan," Gunn said of the project when it was first announced. "We have a few other Lanterns peppered in there but this is really a terrestrial based TV show which is almost like True Detective with a couple of Green Lanterns who are space cops watching over Precinct Earth in it they discover a terrifying mystery that ties into our largest story of the DCU."

I don't think I will ever be signing up for something as fast as this: a famous (and possibly haunted) Duluth attraction is letting you onboard for a special experience.

If you live in Duluth or visit often, chances are you've been onboard the William A. Irvin, located in the heart of Canal Park.

The freighter always opens seasonally for tours, so you can truly get that Duluth experience when you visit town or have visitors in town.

That will be the case once again for long weekends beginning on Friday, May 2nd. It will open every day of the week later the following month, on June 12th. These tours are family friendly - but this isn't the only experience you can get aboard the ship!

This year, you have a chance to tour the ship in a new and haunted way! You can board the William A. Irvin with your ghost hunting equipment and tour the ship looking for all things that go bump in the night.

As of now, there will only be two dates in which you can take advantage of this special tour. The first tour will take place on Friday, June 13th from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. There will be another option on Tuesday, August 26th during the same time period.

Tickets are $75 bucks. If you want to take one of these paranormal tours, grab your fellow supernatural-loving friends, your ghost hunting equipment and get your name in the books! You will have to sign a contract and waiver and bring your own equipment.

You can schedule your place on either tour by emailing organizers at hauntedship@decc.org. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, as paranormal investigators are not often allowed on the vessel for personal or individual tours.

There have long been rumors that the William A. Irvin is actually haunted, and I am not just talking about the annual haunted ship attraction that pops up every Halloween. Many ghost hunters that have investigated the ship have all but confirmed the freighter is indeed haunted.

Staff on the ship have reported 'the sensation of being watched' and heard 'mysterious footsteps' on the ship when its been empty. Why don't you sign up and see for yourself? I want to!

Was a UFO successfully captured on camera in Mexico?

There are few topics on the internet capable of generating more attention than debates and speculation about UFOs and unknown objects in the sky.

Americans are obsessed with whatever is going on up there. Part of the issue is we have no clear answers, despite getting new videos and photos on a pretty regular basis.

That leads us to a new story out of Mexico.

The popular UFO Instagram page @ufo5537 shared a bunch of pictures that allegedly show a UFO photographed near Chiapas.

The post is blowing up, and you'll understand why once you see the pictures. It's arguably the greatest and clearest UFO pictures the internet has ever seen……but does it pass the smell test?

Give it a look below, and let me know your thoughts at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.

I hate to pour cold water on all the hype, but if you asked me on a scale of zero to 100 how much faith I have in these photos, I'd put the number somewhere around .5.

What are the odds an actual UFO happened to be flying over Mexico near someone with a camera, and it looks *EXACTLY* like UFOs from all the movies we enjoy?

Seriously, what are the odds? Seems like it's borderline impossible. Convenient? Sure. Likely? A snowball drenched in gasoline rolling through the gates of hell and surviving has better odds of happening.

I'm willing to believe a lot and I have a very open-mind for the unexplainable. However, I also don't just buy whatever appears on the internet as real. People might be fascinated, but I'm not. For now, I refuse to give this my stamp of approval as real. Think I'm right? Think I'm wrong? Let me know at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.

We finally know more about M. Night Shyamalan's mysterious new movie, which has a story from Shyamalan and The Notebook author Nicholas Sparks.

Jake Gyllenhaal and Phoebe Dynevor will star in the film with a screenplay from Shyamalan, while the book is penned by Sparks. Both share the same story but are being worked on independently.

"I'm excited to share the cover for the novel version of REMAIN, my upcoming collaboration with @NicholasSparks," Shyamalan wrote on Twitter. "The book, written by Nicholas, will be available on 10/7/2025. More news on the film I'm writing and directing coming soon."

A lengthy synopsis can be found on websites listing the book for pre-order. The story follows an architect from New York named Tate Donovan, who has lost his sister. Before her death, she revealed that she can see ghosts, but the logical Tate finds this difficult to believe.

While seeking a fresh start, though, Tate meets a young woman called Wren, who challenges his assumptions. "Tate gradually discovers that below the surface of Wren's idyllic small-town life, hatred, jealousy and greed are festering, threatening their fragile relationship just as it begins to blossom," reads the synopsis. "Tate realizes that in order to free Wren from an increasingly desperate fate, he will need to unearth the truth about her past before time runs out… a quest that will make him doubt whether we can ever believe the stories we tell about ourselves, and the laws that govern our existence. Love – while transformative – can sometimes be frightening."

Shyamalan's most recent movie is Trap, which stars Josh Hartnett as a devoted father and sadistic serial killer.

The new movie doesn't yet have a release date. While you wait, check out our guide to all the most exciting upcoming movies of 2025.

Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) rebuked Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) on Tuesday evening for “peddling conspiracy theories” about the 9/11 attacks.

Johnson, in an interview this week with a conservative influencer, said he wants to hold additional hearings on the attack on the World Trade Center complex in New York City, after watching a documentary and speaking to others who doubt the government's probe into the attack that killed nearly 3,000 people, including hundreds of first responders.

“There are a host of questions that I will be asking, quite honestly, now that my eyes have been opened up,” Johnson said.

Lawler tore into the comments, calling them “crap.”

“Respectfully, Senator Johnson should stop peddling conspiracy theories about the worst terrorist attack in our nation's history and one that forever altered the lives of so many of my fellow New Yorkers,” Lawler wrote on the social platform X, resharing an article about Johnson's remarks.

“Crap like this dishonors and disrespects the innocent lives lost, our brave first responders, and all families and survivors who still carry the pain of 9/11 each and every day,” he added.

Johnson, who is in his third Senate term, chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.

He said in the interview early this week that “there's an awful lot of questions” surrounding 9/11 — particularly about the collapse of Building 7, which fell hours after hijackers crashed two commercial planes into the Twin Towers.

An investigation by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) concluded that Building 7 progressively collapsed from a prolonged fire that couldn't be extinguished due to water supply issues after the building sustained extensive damage. Experts have repeatedly debunked efforts to link Building 7's fall to a controlled demolition.

“It is the firefighters who have been leading the charge for over 20 years to have their legitimate questions answered,” Johnson said in a statement to The Hill Wednesday when asked about the pushback. “I am honoring them by responding to their concerns. I recommend that everyone watch the documentary ‘Calling Out Bravo-7' before criticizing those who are seeking the truth.”

From starring in and co-creating the hit paranormal franchise Ghost Brothers, to becoming one of the most recognizable faces in supernatural television, Dalen Spratt has spent nearly a decade exploring the unknown.

As the first all-Black ghost-hunting team to break into mainstream media, Ghost Brothers redefined what it means to search for spirits — blending humor, heart, and history with real paranormal investigation.

Now, Dalen continues his journey into the beyond with The Graveyard Shift, a personal project and YouTube series where he dives even deeper, focusing on real-time spirit communication using a spirit box, often at historic cemeteries and haunted sites.

This week, he returns to the Tampa Theatre, which he first visited in 2022 with the Ghost Brothers, to investigate one of Tampa's most haunted historic sites for a future episode.

Scientists have developed the world's first operating system designed for quantum computers, which could let quantum computers connect with each other, thereby paving the way for a quantum internet.

An operating system, such as Microsoft Windows or Apple iOS, is the program responsible for managing every other application on a computer. However, most quantum computers are designed and built for a specific function; for example, to run an experiment or simulation.

This limits the potential functionality of quantum computers and hampers their connectivity. There are also different types of quantum computers that use different kinds of quantum bits (qubits) to achieve quantum superposition in different ways.

But on March 12, scientists published a new study in Nature describing QNodeOS, an operating system for quantum computers that works with all kinds of machines irrespective of the type of qubits they use.

Such an operating system would enable multiple quantum computers to be connected together and controlled by the same central platform.

QNodeOS operates by combining a classical network processing unit (CNPU), which is the logical element for initiating the execution of the code, with a quantum network processing unit (QNPU), which controls the quantum code.

Together, the CNPU and QNPU form the QNodeOS, which controls a separate quantum device, called the QDevice.

The QDevice is quantum hardware-dependent technology responsible for executing quantum operations (gates, measurements and entanglements). There would need to be a QDevice for every quantum computer that the QNodeOS is required to operate.

A key component of the QNodeOS is the QDriver, which connects the QNodeOS to the QDevice. The QDriver is the only part of the QNodeOS that is quantum hardware-dependent. It translates the platform-independent quantum operations from QNodeOS into platform-dependent instructions and vice versa, thus enabling the QNodeOS to control different types of quantum computers. Executing a process also requires NetQASM — a universal, platform-independent instruction set architecture for quantum internet applications.

The scientists demonstrated the QNodeOS by connecting different quantum computers together (two made from processed diamonds with nitrogen vacancy centers and another made from electrically changed atoms) and running a test program, in a similar way to how a classical computer performs a calculation using cloud computing.

—Bizarre device uses 'blind quantum computing' to let you access quantum computers from home

—Scientists discover simpler way to achieve Einstein's 'spooky action at a distance' thanks to AI breakthrough — bringing quantum internet closer to reality

Further experimentation with the QNodeOS is required, like using more quantum computers of different types, as well as increasing the distance between them, the researchers noted in the study. The study highlighted that the architecture could be improved by having the CNPU and QNPU on a single system board, to avoid millisecond delays in their communication, rather than relying on two separate boards.

An operating system for quantum computers represents a major step forward in their development. One of the potential applications for a quantum computer operating system is for distributed quantum computing, as well as potentially laying the foundations for a quantum internet.

Fifty years ago, April 21, 1975, was the day our family set foot in the United States, with green cards on hand.

I call it a personal liberation day, not because we left an oppressive country, but because the USA beckoned as a land of possibilities. And this country has been good to us.

Our family has thrived. And within about 10 years I would correct someone referring to Bangladesh as home. Instead, home has been variously Nashville, Tullahoma, Murfreesboro and now Manchester.

I would be less optimistic if I arrived today. And the main reason would be that far too many Americans today see conspiracies all around. Seeing conspiracies everywhere is so third world. Trust me. I came from one.

Regardless of political views, we need to agree on objective facts. As the late great Sen. Patrick Moynihan, D-New York, said, “We are entitled to our own opinions, but not our own facts.”

Low information, high opinion today gets the acclaim it does not deserve.

A technologically advanced country like the United States cannot sustain its lead if too many Americans believe as fact what feels comforting, and dismiss inconvenient information as fake news. We are not North Korea where after decades of information manipulation, people there giggle or weep on cue. That is what happens when people are assigned opinions, or become gullible.

For truth to set us free, we must not believe in distorted truths. The rest will follow to keep the USA the greatest country on earth.

Scientists on an expedition to the South Sandwich Islands near Antarctica have recorded horrifying videos of parasitic copepods feasting on the head of a deep sea rattail fish.

Shocking new footage shows a pair of bloodsucking parasites latched onto the head of a deep-sea rattail fish.

In the video, which the Schmidt Ocean Institute shared in a Facebook post, two copepods — small crustaceans — are positioned on either side of their host's head. Long egg sacs attached at the back of the parasites make it look like the fish is sporting a pair of pig tails.

"They feed on blood and fluids from their host using their scraping mouth parts that are embedded in the muscle of the fish," James Bernot, an evolutionary biologist at Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History who was not on the expedition, told Live Science in an email.

Scientists captured the footage at a depth of 1,604 feet (489 meters) during an expedition to examine the seafloor and biodiversity of the South Sandwich Islands, a chain of 11 subantarctic volcanic islets in the South Atlantic Ocean.

The copepods are a species called Lophoura szidati, and are latched onto the head of a rattail fish from the genus Macrourus, representatives wrote in the Facebook post.

Macrourus are commonly known as grenadiers or rattails because of their large heads and slender tails. These widespread deep-sea fish occupy the cold waters of the North and South Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Southern Ocean that borders Antarctic waters, and can be found at depths from 1,312 to 10,450 feet (400 to 3,185 m).

Knowledge of deep-sea fish parasites in Antarctic waters is scarce, but L. szidati, is one of the most common parasites found on Macrourus species in this region.

L. szidati is part of the family Sphyriidae. Females of this species have been observed using their mouth parts to bore into the bodies of various fish and feed on their host's muscle tissue.

"These copepods are mesoparasites, meaning they are partly inside and partly outside of their host," Bernot said, adding that in the video the middle and back end of the copepods stick out of the fish, while the anterior, or head-end of their body is embedded in the fish.

Many copepod parasites have multiple stages in their life cycle and typically find their hosts while in their larval stage. These tiny larvae bury themselves within the host's skin and begin feeding. During this time they metamorphose and develop anterior holdfasts that serve as anchors to keep them attached to their hosts as they grow.

In the video, each parasite carries a pair of sacs containing hundreds of eggs. "Copepods are surprisingly good mothers for invertebrates," Bernot said. "They carry their eggs in sacs attached to their body until the eggs hatch into swimming nauplius larvae that will molt through several larval stages and eventually go on to find their own host."

Very little is known about the life cycle and lifespan of these parasites, but they are permanent fixtures to the fish and likely live for several months as they grow from a near microscopic size, Bernot said.

"Even after the parasite dies, remnants of the embedded head can still be found in their host for many years," Bernot noted.

In the vastness of space, new discoveries continually reshape our understanding of the universe. Among the most exciting recent finds is Enaiposha, a planet that defies traditional classification. Unveiled in research that pushes the boundaries of our knowledge, Enaiposha is a super-Venus located approximately 47 light-years from the Sun. Its unique characteristics challenge existing planetary categories, offering a glimpse into the diversity of planetary systems beyond our own. As scientists delve deeper into its mysteries, Enaiposha promises to illuminate the complex nature of exoplanetary atmospheres and the vast possibilities of the cosmos.

Enaiposha stands out due to its remarkable dimensions and atmospheric composition. With a radius 2.7 times greater than Earth and a mass 8.2 times that of our planet, Enaiposha occupies a unique position between super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. However, what truly distinguishes this planet is its thick atmosphere, primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, water, methane, and carbon dioxide. The atmospheric conditions suggest a high concentration of water vapor and vaporized metals, drawing comparisons to Venus, hence its moniker “super-Venus.”

The presence of carbon dioxide at levels akin to Venus adds to its intrigue, while the atmosphere's heavy metal content and reduced hydrogen levels pose intriguing questions about its formation. The upper layers, shrouded in haze and aerosols, complicate spectroscopic analysis, making it challenging to gather clear data. Yet, these conditions also offer a unique opportunity to study atmospheric phenomena that differ dramatically from those on Earth, expanding our understanding of planetary science.

Recent spectroscopic studies have unearthed molecular traces across various wavelengths, yet persistent haze poses a significant challenge by dimming the incoming light. The detection of carbon dioxide, although weak, required rigorous statistical analysis to confirm its presence. As Kazumasa Ohno from the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan points out, the initial CO2 signals were minimal, necessitating careful validation to ensure their authenticity.

Beyond carbon dioxide, indications of complex metals and methane in Enaiposha's atmosphere hint at a rich chemical composition. These discoveries provide crucial insights into the intricate atmospheric dynamics of such dense exoplanets. By analyzing these components, scientists gain a deeper understanding of the formation and evolution of planets with thick atmospheres, laying the groundwork for future explorations of similar celestial bodies.

The research team, led by Everett Schlawin from the University of Arizona and Kazumasa Ohno, emphasizes the importance of continued observation of Enaiposha. Advanced instruments and further measurements are essential to refine our knowledge of this fascinating planet. Understanding the evolution of thick atmospheres over time and exploring the potential transformation of sub-Neptunes under certain conditions remain key objectives for researchers.

Questions persist about the formation of droplets or complex clouds from the metals present in Enaiposha's atmosphere. Investigating these phenomena could significantly enhance our understanding of atmospheric evolution on other worlds. While Enaiposha may not be habitable due to its extreme conditions, it offers a unique opportunity to explore planetary atmospheres in diverse environments, potentially providing insights applicable to less hostile exoplanets.

The findings from the Enaiposha studies have been published in two separate articles in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, highlighting the planet's significant scientific value. By challenging traditional categories like mini-Neptunes, Enaiposha compels scientists to rethink existing models and encourages deeper explorations into the universe's mysteries. The data gathered from this exoplanet could pave the way for new theories and methodologies in the study of planetary atmospheres.

As researchers continue to unravel Enaiposha's secrets, the potential for groundbreaking discoveries remains vast. This exoplanet serves as a testament to the endless possibilities of space exploration and the ever-evolving nature of our understanding of the cosmos. With each new finding, we inch closer to a comprehensive knowledge of the universe's vast and varied worlds.

Enaiposha stands as a beacon of scientific curiosity and discovery, challenging our perceptions of planetary formation and evolution. As we continue to explore this super-Venus and its complex atmosphere, what new revelations might await us in the uncharted territories of space? The journey to uncover the universe's secrets has only just begun.

Wow, this is mind-blowing! Are we really not alone in the universe? 🤯

Where is the declaration of “definitive proof of alien life…”? The article even says it's probably not habitable. Are you letting AI write your headlines now?

Could Enaiposha's atmosphere support any form of life, even if it's microscopic?

I'm a bit skeptical. How can we be sure these observations are accurate?

Does this mean we're one step closer to finding intelligent life? 🚀

Even though Stephen King has been crowned 'The Master of Horror' (alongside John Carpenter) over the past 50 years of successfully petrifying his readers, the legendary author isn't averse to being scared himself. Although it's certainly hard to imagine, especially given that the terrifying books IT and Salem's Lot were conjured from his mind, it seems as though there are quite a few films that keep him up at night, and one of them is a supernatural terror that brave Stephen King devotees can stream for free.

King is undoubtedly one of the planet's biggest horror writers, who has sold millions of books across every corner of the globe, and it's easy to see why. Not only does he capture the darkest parts of readers' imagination and bring them to life in a twisted puppet show, but the Maine native also offers a sense of escapism and nostalgia, while also blending terror with relatable human experiences. Naturally, many directors have flocked to King's writings to adapt many of his books, with some of the most recent being The Life of Chuck, Welcome to Derry, The Long Walk (written under Stephen King's pseudonym Richard Bachman), The Running Man, and countless others that include Carrie, which are in currently in development. For those who enjoy King's movie and TV show recommendations, one starring George C. Scott, Trish Van Devere, and Melvyn Douglas should be on your watch list. 

Stephen King's novels and short stories are some of the scariest stories out there, and the beloved author is praising a movie fans will want to see.

As reported by ComicBook, Stephen King previously revealed in an essay for the British Film Institute that The Changeling, a 1980 supernatural horror film directed by Peter Medak and starring George C. Scott, Trish Van Devere, and Melvyn Douglas, terrified the life out of him. King said that due to the simple yet creepy atmosphere of the movie, which didn't include any gory creatures or in-your-face scare factors, it was more than enough to keep him up at night. “For supernatural horror, I like Peter Medak's film The Changeling starring George C. Scott in perhaps his last great screen role,” King penned. “There are no monsters bursting from chests; just a child's ball bouncing down a flight of stairs was enough to scare the daylights out of me.”

For those wondering what the plot of The Changeling includes that scared King so much, it follows the story of John Russell, his wife, and daughter, who all head off on vacation, but before they get to their destination, their car gets stuck in snow. While calling for roadside help at a phone box, John's wife and daughter are tragically killed by an oncoming truck that smashes into the car. Grieving for their loss, he moves to an old mansion to get away from it all, but soon after moving in, John begins to experience unexplained and terrifying supernatural activities within the walls of the historic house. 

Previously, Stephen King said that his number one scariest film as an adult was watching George A. Romero's low-budget creation, Night of the Living Dead, while also mentioning that when he was 16 years old, Robert Wise's 1963 movie The Haunting was the scariest film at the time. However, it's not only movies that King has a soft spot for, as he loved From and Silo too, calling them both "worth his time."

As for where King fans can watch The Changeling and see what all the fuss is about, it is currently streaming on Tubi for free, Pluto TV, and The Roku Channel, plus Shudder and Peacock.

Based on Stephen King's bestselling novel, HBO's prequel series IT: Welcome to Derry receives its first official poster with new preview shots.

The Vatican's secret archives have long been a magnet for mystery - and now, alien intrigue.

Sprawling across more than 50 miles of underground shelving, these heavily guarded documents have fueled wild speculation for centuries. 

But some researchers now believe the Holy See could be sitting on the biggest secret of all: proof of extraterrestrial life.

As outlandish as it sounds, recent testimony by former US intelligence insiders claim the Vatican and American government have worked together to investigate, cover up and, most shockingly, study, UFOs.

Following the death of Pope Francis at age 88 on Easter Monday, UFO investigator and filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee is calling on the next pontiff to come clean.

Lee, who has spent three decades studying the links between religion, history and alien phenomena, claims the Vatican may be harboring 'hundreds' of classified files on UFO sightings - some possibly dating back centuries. 

'If the Church is truly committed to spiritual truth and human enlightenment, then it must no longer suppress information that could fundamentally reshape our understanding of our place in the cosmos,' Lee said in a statement. 

He believes many divine encounters described in religious texts, including the Bible, could in fact be misinterpreted alien sightings. And he's not alone in that theory. 

One event Lee is desperate to reexamine is the infamous Third Secret of Fatima. 

In 1917, three young Portuguese shepherds claimed to have seen a glowing apparition in the sky. The children, and the Vatican, have always maintained it was the Virgin Mary.

But Lee argues otherwise.

'If you read their original descriptions, what they wrote down, it's actually like orbs of light in the sky,' he told the Daily Mail. 

'This was not the Virgin Mary,' he said previously. 'This was a non-human intelligence trying to communicate with us, and the Vatican knows it.' 

In 2000, the Church released what it claimed was the full text of the so-called Third Secret. But many experts, including Lee, remain unconvinced. 

'There are definitely secrets in the Vatican,' he insisted. 

Recent testimony by former US spies appears to back him up. 

David Grusch, a decorated Air Force officer-turned-UFO whistleblower, claimed in a 2023 interview that the Catholic Church has been aware of alien life for decades.

According to him, the Italian government recovered a crashed UFO during Mussolini's fascist regime, and the Vatican helped cover it up.

Grusch alleged that Pope Pius XII even 'backchanneled' details of the incident to American intelligence officials, who then swooped in and seized the craft. 

When asked point blank if he believed the Church knew about the existence of extraterrestrials, Grusch didn't hesitate. 'Certainly,' he said. 

As for what may be driving the Vatican to withhold its alleged knowledge of extraterrestrials from the public, Lee suspects it may stem from the Church's concerns about inciting panic, or that it could shake people's faith.

'Why should we believe in one God, one Christ, if there's other life out there?' He asked. But he believes it's only a matter of time until the Vatican has no choice but to reveal what it knows. 

Thanks to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and other highly advanced research instruments, scientists have already found signatures of life beyond Earth.

Most recently, astronomers used JWST to detect dimethyl sulfide molecules in the atmosphere of a planet known as K2-18b. 

On Earth, this chemical is almost exclusively produced by life forms like marine algae, leading the team to believe it could be a biosignature of alien life.

Lee expects that researchers will soon find evidence of intelligent extraterrestrials, perhaps even within the next few months, he said. 

Such a revelation would put increased pressure on the Vatican to make any records of UFO encounters public, he suggests. 

What's more, releasing this information is important to national security and public safety, he adds, as it's possible some of these flying objects weren't alien at all, rather advanced military technologies wielded by global powers. 

'What people are seeing in the sky, they could be genuine extraterrestrial UFOs, but there's also most likely going to be secret military technology years and years ahead of what we think they've got,' Lee said. 

'I think people in the UFO community need to be aware of that. It's not just little green men visiting, it's more complicated.'

Pope Francis' successor will be elected by the College of Cardinals, who are all men that were appointed by the Pope and are usually ordained bishops. 

The election process, or 'conclave,' typically begins after a 15-day mourning period following the Pope's death, and can last for weeks or months.

That's because the new Pope isn't elected until he has won at least 90 votes, which may take several rounds of voting. 

Lee is hopeful that the next person elected to the papacy will begin to disclose any information the Vatican may have about potential UFO and extraterrestrial sightings.

'I think the public deserves to know,' he said. 'We don't need to be protected from this information.'

As for what may be driving the Vatican to withhold its alleged knowledge of extraterrestrials from the public, Lee suspects it may stem from the Church's concerns about inciting panic, or that it could shake people's faith.

'Why should we believe in one God, one Christ, if there's other life out there?' He asked. But he believes it's only a matter of time until the Vatican has no choice but to reveal what it knows. 

Thanks to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and other highly advanced research instruments, scientists have already found signatures of life beyond Earth.

Most recently, astronomers used JWST to detect dimethyl sulfide molecules in the atmosphere of a planet known as K2-18b. 

On Earth, this chemical is almost exclusively produced by life forms like marine algae, leading the team to believe it could be a biosignature of alien life.

Lee expects that researchers will soon find evidence of intelligent extraterrestrials, perhaps even within the next few months, he said. 

Such a revelation would put increased pressure on the Vatican to make any records of UFO encounters public, he suggests. 

What's more, releasing this information is important to national security and public safety, he adds, as it's possible some of these flying objects weren't alien at all, rather advanced military technologies wielded by global powers. 

'What people are seeing in the sky, they could be genuine extraterrestrial UFOs, but there's also most likely going to be secret military technology years and years ahead of what we think they've got,' Lee said. 

'I think people in the UFO community need to be aware of that. It's not just little green men visiting, it's more complicated.'

Pope Francis' successor will be elected by the College of Cardinals, who are all men that were appointed by the Pope and are usually ordained bishops. 

The election process, or 'conclave,' typically begins after a 15-day mourning period following the Pope's death, and can last for weeks or months.

That's because the new Pope isn't elected until he has won at least 90 votes, which may take several rounds of voting. 

Lee is hopeful that the next person elected to the papacy will begin to disclose any information the Vatican may have about potential UFO and extraterrestrial sightings.

'I think the public deserves to know,' he said. 'We don't need to be protected from this information.'
