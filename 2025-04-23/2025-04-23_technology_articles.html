Lenovo, HP, and Dell, the world's three largest PC vendors, are reportedly exploring expansion options in Saudi Arabia. The three tech giants are all in different stages of starting production facilities in or near Saudi Arabia's capital city, Riyadh. Lenovo has already declared its plans to build a PC and server assembly factory in Riyadh, and is backed by a $2 billion investment from a subsidiary of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF). HP and Dell have now reportedly sent teams to conduct visits to the country and scout potential construction sites after requests from local governments. The ODMs claim that the potential for development in Saudi Arabia hinges on client willingness and outside logistical factors.Saudi Arabia is offering some big promises to potential business partners, and many of these promises are highly attractive to OEMs — but less convincing to ODMs. The potential in-roads into the African market beyond Saudi Arabia were credited as a large part of Lenovo's decision to take its $2 billion Riyadh deal. Lenovo's plant is planned to be fully operational in 2026, at which point Lenovo will begin producing a direct-to-Saudi-Arabia line of products. While this promise of expansion into the greater African and Middle Eastern market is highly attractive to vendors like Lenovo, the ODMs who design their add-in boards are less keen. ODMs require existing supply chain and logistics conditions beyond just labor and production facilities to successfully produce innovative designs — and though Saudi Arabia's goals are high, they do not currently stand out against most ODMs' current operational partners. Vietnam and Thailand are the main production hubs for ODMs such as Foxconn outside of China, thanks to tested supply chain connections. Many ODMs also already have production and R&D facilities in Mexico to take advantage of USMCA free-trade agreements and allow them to skirt U.S. tariffs. ODMs already have proven clients in the OEMs, whereas the OEMs are more likely to be concerned with expanding their market reach. This large-scale courting of the computing industry into Saudi Arabia is part of KSA's "Vision 2030" economic plan, which is built on a goal of moving Saudi Arabia's economy beyond fossil fuels and into a more diverse, modern trade giant.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amid rumors that the company is eyeing an IPO, Discord appointed former Activision Blizzard Vice Chairman Humam Sakhnini as CEO. Discord co-founder Jason Citron will leave his CEO role after 13 years at the company. Discord straddles the gaming and social media spaces — despite its initial emergence as a platform for online multiplayer gamers to communicate, it has become a prominent social media platform in its own right, growing to over 200 million monthly active users. Sakhnini was also CEO of the Activision Blizzard-owned King, a mobile gaming developer that makes games like Candy Crush, which thrive on ads and micro-transactions.

She has also written for publications like Polygon, MTV, the Kenyon Review, NPR, and Business Insider.

China's top three internet companies reportedly stockpiled billions of dollars worth of Nvidia H20 GPUs before the U.S. export restrictions went into effect in April. Nikkei Asia reports that ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent anticipated the likelihood of an export ban on the China-specific H20 last year, and have since been snapping up as many H20 GPUs as they can get their hands on.The three companies have reportedly accumulated around 1 million H20s — or about a full year's supply. While that is a significant number of GPUs, the companies' full supply was cut short by a month, as they requested that Nvidia ship them their fully-requested volume of H20s by the end of May. If all three companies managed to get their hands on all the H20s they requested, the total value would exceed $12 billion.High demand for computing power is apparently the main reason for the companies' stockpiling: Tencent's integration of DeepSeek into WeChat is a huge contributor to China's demand for computing power.The Nvidia H20 will serve as a stop-gap solution for Chinese companies until homegrown AI GPUs are able to provide similar — or better — performance. Huawei is reportedly working on a new Ascend GPU claimed to rival the performance of Nvidia's GB200, which would give China the same AI computing capabilities as Western countries. The new restriction will force Nvidia to take a massive $5.5 billion financial hit, as it can no longer sell its existing inventory of H20 GPUs to China.The H20 is a cut-down variant of the H100 — Nvidia's predecessor to the current HGX B200.

ET, or 9:00 p.m. Pacific Time on April 23, preorders for the Nintendo console will be available to fans all over the United States online. Like Target and Best Buy, Walmart's online pre-orders begin precisely at midnight ET on April 24. What sets Walmart apart is its promotion of free (and guaranteed) delivery by 9 a.m. local time on release day, June 5, for orders placed by June 4 at 8 a.m. This early delivery promise on launch day is a special advantage that can be a lifesaver if you're eager to start playing as soon as possible. Since Mario Kart World alone retails for $79.99, the bundle is a great value if you want to get into the new racing game immediately. The portable display has increased to 7.9 inches at full 1080p resolution which is a big jump from the original's 6.2-inch 720p screen. If you like to play on your TV, you will find that the new console offers 4K output for visuals that were not possible on the original Switch. The refresh rate is doubled (to 120Hz) when in handheld mode, and you'll get HDR support. Beyond the screen, the Switch 2 also features a new kickstand design that is wider and adjustable at various angles for improved comfort. The Joy-Con controllers now magnetically clip on and connect via pins for simpler setup. Storage has also been increased to 256GB (from the original 32GB) and it supports faster microSD Express cards. What's for sure is that securing a Switch 2 preorder requires moving quickly: demand will probably outpace supply. Stock will likely be gone quickly, and tariffs or import fees can cause prices to increase at any time. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

This Anker USB-C car charger is perfect for the job and right now it's part of a limited time deal—chopping 20% off the price. The Anker car charger is universally compatible.

Polymaker, a global supplier of affordable filament, recently announced that it will be forced to increase prices by 10% on May 1st. In a statement issued on its website, Polymaker said it reviewed the amount of stock sitting in U.S. warehouses before making the difficult decision to hike prices to compensate for tariffs. I had the chance to talk to Polymaker representatives at Rapid + TCT in Detroit earlier this month and ask them if the new Houston, TX plant would help keep costs down. Unfortunately for the average consumer, the Texas facility specializes in wholesale customers and only produces PLA, PETG, ABS, and ASA in limited colors. But if that's you, congratulations, your prices are holding steady. Many American filament manufacturers are able to keep their supply chain domestic thanks to NatureWorks, a U.S. plastics company that creates raw PLA pellets from Nebraska-grown corn. American filament companies are taking advantage of the tariff talks to remind customers that they can always buy local. Polar Filament in Troy, MI announced on social media that pricing would remain the same, as its entire supply chain is US-based. We're also setting up our own injection molding machine so we can make spools right here at our facility,” said Mitch Davis in the statement. Free shipping for US customers kicks in after three spools. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. I also stopped to chat with New York-based GreenGate manufacturer Rich Silberfeld during Rapid + TCT in Detroit. GreenGate makes premium recycled PETG filament that can easily print at lower PLA temperatures. Silberfeld said his filament not only saves plastic scraps from going into the landfill, but also uses domestic colorants and spools. He was showcasing a special color, Spartan Armor Green, in honor of Michigan State University while stationed in the America Makes section of Rapid + TCT. Here are a few more of our favorite tried and tested, Made in the USA filaments that use domestic NatureWorks raw materials.

Tesla's humanoid robot Optimus, which it says is designed for taking over household chores, has recently hit a production snag, which Elon Musk calls a “magnet issue.” In early April, China blocked the export of seven rare earth metals in response to President Trump's application of 54% tariffs on Chinese goods. Aside from being used in global chipmaking supply chains, these materials are also applied in several high-tech industries, including lasers, radar, jet engines, and more. Hopefully, we'll get a license to use the rare-earth magnets,” Elon Musk said. However, even if this robot is designed as a substitute for a household employee, its inherent humanoid design makes it useful for other tasks, including those that China might deem “military applications”. Aside from that, Musk's other companies, like SpaceX, have active contracts with the U.S. military. Musk is closely allied with the U.S. president and works with him directly through DOGE or the Department of Government Efficiency. Some companies are looking for alternatives to Chinese sources for these rare earth metals, especially as China has claimed state ownership of all this material within its borders. However, they'd have difficulty looking for a replacement that can deliver at the exact cost and quality because of how much the East Asian country has invested in mining them. Many exporters have already expected delays because of China's new requirements. However, Tesla is one of the first companies to publicly state the impact of China's export bans on its plans and production. He also said that Trump's tariffs have greatly impacted Tesla's energy business, primarily as it imports its battery cells from the country.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since the arrival of nuclear power in the 1950s, more than 400 reactors in 31 countries have produced about 430,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel, and until now no one has developed a permanent solution for disposing of it. The International Atomic Energy Agency estimates that about 30 percent of this fuel has been reprocessed—elements in spent fuel can be recycled to create new fuel for nuclear plants—but the rest has been “parked” in temporary storage systems, with its final destination yet to be determined. And with the nuclear sector showing signs of undergoing a renaissance—as countries look to decarbonize energy production and with the tech sector seeking ways to power its electricity-hungry AI systems—the pressure for nuclear-waste disposal is likely to grow. The best solution would be to put spent fuel in an underground facility that can contain it safely for millennia. The repository is being built by Posiva Oy, a Finnish company set up by two of the country's nuclear operators in 1995 to find a way of permanently storing spent nuclear fuel. In the bedrock here, at a depth of 430 meters, testing is underway. Storage of spent fuel involves placing spent fuel rods inside copper canisters, which in turn have to be inserted into slots dug into the granite walls of the subterranean repository. Everything is then sealed with bentonite, a soft, plastic clay that insulates the containers and acts as a buffer against minor movements in the bedrock. In mid-March, five test containers, filled with nonradioactive materials, were sealed in a special aboveground facility before being transported underground and stored along a 70-meter-long subterranean tunnel, to provide an initial proof of concept for Onkalo's storage process. Onkalo's construction has so far cost €900 million, while an estimated €4 billion more is needed to complete the project. Breaking ground here followed decades of research to find the best location for the repository and years waiting for permits and approvals. Some locals have been hostile to the project, unhappy with the prospect of nuclear waste being stored nearby and perplexed at how easily, in their opinion, Posiva Oy was able to get permits for the repository. Researchers have also expressed concerns about potential corrosion of storage containers, specifically the copper canisters. Together with his colleagues, Jinshan Pan, a professor of corrosion science at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, published a study in January 2023 devoted to the risk of sulfides in groundwater corroding the copper used for spent nuclear fuel containers. While Posiva Oy looks like it may have the first functioning repository, other countries are following its lead. It is a major work that has been on the drawing table for 40 years and obtained its necessary environmental permits for construction only a few months ago. The repository doesn't exist yet, but the path forward appears relatively free of obstacles—at least there are no apparent legal ones. Both the town and nation were open to the project, seeing it as a source of investments and new jobs. France and Switzerland are also working on projects, gradually making progress, even if much of it is a matter of getting over bureaucratic hurdles. In the Meuse region of northeastern France, field work on the Cigéo project could begin in 2027 now that it has received a positive assessment of its soundness. It has chosen to build its repository north of Zurich, in Nördlich Lägern, because it is an area particularly rich in very compact opaline clay, which is perfect for acting as a long-term container for radioactive materials. Finally, Italy is considering 51 sites that could potentially be suitable to host a repository for nuclear waste storage. In the meantime, radioactive waste in the country remains stored in temporary repositories at the sites of decommissioned nuclear power plants, nuclear research facilities, and nuclear medicine and industry locations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But it is real, and is an oasis for endemic and migratory birds that cross the Colorado River delta. Here, just south of the US-Mexico border, used water from the city of Mexicali gets a second life. For many years, this water course received untreated sewage from Mexicali, rendering it one of the worst-polluted rivers of its size in the US. And so, in 2007, south of Mexicali, the Las Arenitas treatment plant began operations. Mexicali, which sits right on the border, generates more than 80 million cubic meters of sewage a year. Next, surface-aerated lagoons are used, where air is injected into the water to stimulate the growth of aerobic bacteria, which decompose organic matter in the presence of oxygen. To combat this, some organizations proposed to the water management agency that they should use the surrounding land, which decades ago housed a lake, to create an artificial wetland that would give the water additional cleanliness. Such a plan, as well as helping with the city's sewage problem, would also help partially restore the local landscape to its former state. Although the river's course has become a ghost, about 15 percent of those wetlands have survived, harboring an invaluable biodiversity of plants and animals. In addition, they replaced obsolete equipment and made repairs to the plant. This process, where plants naturally cleanse water, is known as phytoremediation, and it occurs both underground in the roots of tule and alkaline reed, but also on the surface of the wetland waters, where microorganisms that degrade pollutants live. Microscopic life within the wetlands cleanses the water in diverse ways, such as by transforming nitrogen into other substances and by assimilating phosphorus into its own biomass. In addition, physical processes such as sedimentation occur, in which smaller particles fall to the bottom of the water body. The wetlands' battle to maintain their balance is titanic, as the water treatment plant has been operating above capacity since 2013. The plant has an installed capacity of 840 liters per second, but it reaches 1,044 liters per second in some months. An expansion of the plant, while urgent, is yet to happen—though it has been on the table for more than five years. It's possible to smell when the wetland ecosystem is out of kilter: The decomposition of organic matter there can generate unpleasant odors when these systems are under stress or out of balance, giving the environment an earthy, pungent aroma. The Las Arenitas complex has transformed 99 hectares into a wetland. “That the water from Las Arenitas flows along the Hardy River generates environmental potential; many species of birds and other wildlife use this area or live in it,” says Santiago. Plants in wetlands help the process through phytoremediation. Re-creating wetlands in the region also has a unique ecological benefit. Six years later, researchers counted 160 different species, with a peak count of 18,000 birds. They have recorded Yuma clapper rails, brown pelicans, peregrine falcons, and northern shovelers. The city of Mexicali depends on the Colorado River and its underground water reserves, but it uses water at an unsustainable rate. Annual recharge of the Mexicali Valley aquifer is 520.5 cubic hectometers (hm3), but more water is withdrawn from this underground store each year than reenters it (783.12 hm3). Without Las Arenitas, the situation would be even worse, but drastically more needs to be done to balance the region's water use. “My dream for Las Arenitas is that the community will come to enjoy it, but, at the same time, that there will be better water use in our homes so that less water reaches this area in poor conditions,” Santiago says.
