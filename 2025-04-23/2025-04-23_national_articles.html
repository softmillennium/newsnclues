                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Democratic Party‘s favorability has dipped across the board since the 2024 election, and a new survey shows its standing has dramatically slipped with younger voters in recent years. The Harvard Youth Poll from the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School, released Wednesday, shows that young people are not impressed with Democrats in Congress. Their support for congressional Democrats falls below that of congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump. In the survey, conducted with 2,096 18-to-29-year-olds last month, just 23% approved of the job congressional Democrats are doing, compared to 29% who approve of congressional Republicans' job performance and 32% who approve of Trump's job performance. In Harvard's 2017 and 2020 youth polls, congressional Democrats had significantly higher approval ratings than their GOP counterparts or Trump. In less than five years, their approval rating has dropped 25% among young people. Through the 2017, 2020, and 2025 polls, young people's views on Republicans in Congress and Trump have remained stable, only fluctuating a couple of percentage points. While Trump's job performance rating, 31%, was nearly identical to 2017's 32% and slightly up from 2020's 29%, the demographic breakdown shifted. While Democrats have aimed to regain ground with these demographics, some have insisted that messaging is not the problem. In an appearance on MSNBC last week, Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC), an influential Democrat, deferred blame to the media for the party's poor polling figures.</p>

He is criminally charged with forcing oral sex on her in 2006, but she also accused him in a civil lawsuit of groping her against her will four years earlier, when she was 16. Like the two other accusers in the case, Sokola alleges a complex series of encounters and reactions — being sexually assaulted, yet staying in touch, wary of Weinstein but wanting to remain on good terms with a power broker who dangled the possibility of an acting career. … It's because Harvey Weinstein defined the field,” prosecutor Shannon Lucey told jurors in an opening statement. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports Harvey Weinstein's rape retrial has started with opening arguments. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty, and defense lawyer Arthur Aidala countered by portraying the accusers as willing partners in a showbiz quid pro quo. He compared prosecutors' allegations to the preview of a movie that “falls flat on its face.” The 73-year-old Weinstein, seated in the wheelchair he now uses because of health problems, didn't look at Lucey or the jury during her presentation before Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and others in a packed courtroom audience. But Weinstein watched intently as Aidala outlined his defense. The retrial is happening because New York's top court last year threw out Weinstein's conviction, which in 2020 was a watershed moment for the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct. Weinstein's retrial is playing out at a different cultural moment than the first. #MeToo, which exploded in 2017 with allegations against Weinstein, has evolved and ebbed. Nevertheless, Sokola's lawyer, Lindsay Goldbrum, has called Weinstein's retrial a “signal to other survivors that the system is catching up — and that it's worth speaking out even when the odds seem insurmountable.” After the high court sent the case back for retrial, prosecutors added a criminal sex act charge based on her allegations. The Polish-born Sokola met Weinstein in 2002 after traveling alone to New York for a modeling trip at age 16, according to prosecutors. Over the next few years, Sokola stayed in contact with Weinstein, even after telling him off for allegedly groping her in a car around 2004, Lucey told jurors. After the lunch, he lured Sokola to his Manhattan hotel room by saying he had scripts for her to see, ordered her to undress, held her down on a bed, and performed oral sex on her while she tearfully implored him not to do so, Lucey said. In the weeks after, Sokola was photographed with Weinstein and a third person at an event, and his company wrote her a recommendation letter for acting school, the prosecutor said. After other allegations emerged against Weinstein in 2017, Sokola sued. Aidala said Sokola and the other accusers were “trying to take advantage of Mr. Weinstein when he was at the top,” then benefited from making allegations “when he was headed toward the bottom.” Outside court, Sokola's attorney decried Weinstein's defense as full of “victim blaming” and “rape myths.” In addition to the charge related to Sokola, Weinstein is being retried on a criminal sex act charge for allegedly forcibly performing oral sex on then-production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006, and a third-degree rape charge for allegedly assaulting then-aspiring actor Jessica Mann in 2013. Weinstein's 2020 acquittals on two other charges — predatory sexual assault and first-degree rape — still stand. The Associated Press generally does not identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley, Mann and Sokola have done.</p>

Vice President JD Vance spoke to reporters Tuesday during a visit to India after Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that he would not attend talks in London aimed at ending the war. President Donald Trump slammed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement on Crimea, saying it was "very harmful" to peacemaking efforts. "It's inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy's that make it so difficult to settle this war," Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. The situation for Ukraine is dire — He can have peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole country." Trump also rejected Zelenskyy's red line in the Truth Social post, saying it was "not even a point of discussion," as the territory was "lost years ago" under then-President Barack Obama. American officials have apparently floated the idea of recognizing Russia's control of Crimea, a territory that Russia seized in 2014, as part of a ceasefire proposal. This would also involve the freezing of current frontlines. In 2022, Zelenskyy said that the "Russian war against Ukraine and against the entire free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea — and its liberation," Axios reported. He reiterated this stance on Tuesday, shutting down the idea that Ukraine would recognize Russian control of Crimea. "Ukraine will not legally recognize the occupation of Crimea," Zelenskyy said at a press conference here on Tuesday, according to the Wall Street Journal. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy talks during a joint press conference with European Parliament President Roberta Metsola in Kyiv Ukraine, on May 9, 2024. During their infamous meeting in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, Trump said that Zelenskyy's "hatred" of Russian President Vladimir Putin was making it "very tough" to make a deal. "You see the hatred he's got for Putin, it's very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hate, he's got tremendous hatred," Trump told reporters. "And I understand that, but I can tell you the other side isn't exactly in love with, you know, him either." This echoed Trump's remark during the tense February meeting in which he said that Zelenskyy didn't "have the cards" to make major demands in peace talks. While Zelenskyy has made his demands clear, it remains uncertain what might persuade Putin to agree to a ceasefire. Although Trump administration officials have stated that they have had productive conversations with Putin, they have yet to get Russia to agree to a ceasefire proposal. Earlier on Wednesday, Vice President JD Vance suggested that the U.S. was prepared to walk away from peace talks if Ukraine and Russia did not reach a deal soon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is planning to install two 100-foot flagpoles on the White House grounds. The president announced the plans for the flagpoles, which he said he would pay for out of his own pocket, after he emerged from the White House residence just before 11 a.m. Wednesday with a coterie of aides and Secret Service agents. “It was something I've often said, you know, they don't have a flagpole per se,” he said of his design proposals. “So we're putting one right where you saw us, and we're putting another one on the other side, on top of the mounds. Prior to his announcement, Trump went on a roughly 10-minute walk across the White House grounds, where he appeared to discuss the potential changes to the North Lawn. Before reentering the White House, Trump did a brief question-and-answer session about his desired flagpoles and the impacts of his tariff agenda, during which he claimed that his negotiations with China and other trade partners are progressing. “Every country wants to partake, even countries that have ripped us off for many, many years, China, as an example,” Trump said. “But it's not just China, European Union. Everybody wants to be a part of what we're doing. They know that they can't get away with it any longer, but they're still going to do fine, and we're going to have a country that you can be proud of.”</p>

XX-XY Athletics founder Jennifer Sey on Washington State failing to pass proposals to protect girls' sports and a report that former President Joe Biden secretly believed that trans athletes shouldn't compete alongside women. EXCLUSIVE: Rep. Mary Miller, R-Ill., called on President Donald Trump's administration to take action against her state. In a letter obtained by Fox News Digital addressed to the Departments of Education and Justice, Miller pleaded for the agencies to investigate after the Illinois High School Association (IHSA) said it would continue allowing trans athletes to compete in girls' sports. "I am writing to express my deep concern regarding a recent decision by the Illinois High School Association (IHSA), which has chosen to blatantly disregard federal law and reject basic biological reality by allowing biological males to compete in girls' athletic programs. This misguided policy not only undermines the integrity and fairness of girls' sports, but it also jeopardizes the safety of young women across our state," Miller wrote. Miller provided a statement to Fox News Digital addressing the letter, and condemning Gov. "I'm calling on Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary Linda McMahon to launch an immediate investigation into the IHSA and the State of Illinois. J.B. Pritzker and radical Illinois Democrats must be held accountable for enforcing abusive, anti-science gender policies ahead of the safety of our daughters and the fairness of girls' sports," Miller said. Illinois became one of the many blue states to openly defy Trump's "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" executive order after it was signed on Feb. 5. In a public letter to state GOP lawmakers last week, the IHSA said Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and the Illinois Department of Human Rights have declared that state law requires that transgender athletes be allowed to participate based on gender identity. That letter came in response to GOP lawmakers sending their own letter to the IHSA in March asking what the body would do to change policy after Trump's executive order passed. "The Illinois High School Association has crossed a dangerous line. By blatantly violating federal law and rejecting biological reality, they are not only undermining fairness in girls' sports – they're putting the safety of young women at risk," Miller told Fox News Digital. Deerfield Public Schools District 109 is facing a probe by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights after Illinois mother Nicole Georgas brought light to the situation. Georgas has now told Fox News Digital she is also worried about her daughter's athletic future because of the IHSA's ruling. "Imagine your daughter, dedicating her life, training for years, hours and hours a week, for her championship state race, only to face a male beating her and winning that coveted scholarship. Our daughter's dedication to athletics is slowly being erased," Georgas said. "Deerfield Public Schools District 109 complies with state law. The Illinois Human Rights Act prohibits all public school districts from discriminating on the basis of sex, including gender identity, and mandates that students must be permitted access to the locker room and bathroom that aligns with their gender identity," the statement said. Meanwhile, Maine has already seen the type of intervention that Miller is calling for. That state has seen its federal funding cut by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Justice has launched a lawsuit against it for continued defiance of Trump's order. Maine has launched its own lawsuit against the Trump administration over the funding freeze, and a federal judge has ruled it be unfrozen. A New York Times/Ipsos survey found the vast majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, don't think transgender athletes should be permitted to compete in women's sports. Of the 2,128 people who participated, 79% said biological males who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports. Of the 1,025 people who identified as Democrats or leaning Democratic, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete with women.

Kaja Sokola, a former model from Poland, alleges that Weinstein pinned her to a bed and forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006 after luring her to his Manhattan hotel room with the promise of movie scripts. Four years earlier, Sokola alleges, he molested her at his apartment when she was just 16, Assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey told jurors. Sokola previously sued and received $3.5 million in compensation, Lucey said. It's the first time Manhattan prosecutors have detailed Sokola's allegations, which were added to the case after New York's highest court overturned Weinstein's conviction last year. The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley, Mann and Sokola have done. Emphasizing Weinstein's onetime influence in the movie industry, Lucey said the ex-studio boss used “dream opportunities as weapons” to prey on women. Weinstein, she said, “held the golden ticket: a chance to make it, or not.” The Oscar-winning producer, seated in the wheelchair he now uses because of health problems, whispered with one of his lawyers and appeared to take notes as Lucey described his alleged crimes, but he didn't look at the jury. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone. His lawyer, Arthur Aidala, told jurors in his opening statement that Weinstein engaged in “mutually beneficial relationships” with women who wanted his help in the industry but that nothing he did was illegal. “In this case, the casting couch is not a crime scene,” Aidala argued. He implored jurors to view the case with an open mind and to wait until they've heard all of the evidence before reaching a conclusion. “How often is a preview great, but the movie falls flat on its face?” the defense lawyer said. “After you hear all of the evidence, their case is going to fall flat on its face.” Weinstein's retrial is playing out at a different cultural moment than the first. #MeToo, which exploded in 2017 with allegations against Weinstein, has evolved and ebbed. The jury counts seven women and five men — unlike the seven-man, five-woman panel that convicted him in 2020 — and there's a different judge. Prosecutors said she came forward days before his first trial but wasn't part of that case. Weinstein's acquittals on the two most serious charges at his 2020 trial — predatory sexual assault and first-degree rape — still stand. Sokola's lawyer, Lindsay Goldbrum, said Weinstein's retrial marks a “pivotal moment in the fight for accountability in sex abuse cases” and a “signal to other survivors that the system is catching up — and that it's worth speaking out even when the odds seem insurmountable.” During jury selection, a prosecutor asked prospective jurors whether they'd heard of the #MeToo movement. Most said they had, but that it wouldn't affect them either way.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) will not run for a sixth term in the Senate, clearing the way for a younger crop of Democrats to compete for his seat. Durbin, 80, announced Wednesday that he will retire from the Senate in 2026. But his announcement means Democrats who were previously mounting a shadow primary can now run openly for one of Illinois's two Senate seats. “The decision of whether to run for re-election has not been easy. I truly love the job of being a United States Senator. But in my heart, I know it's time to pass the torch,” Durbin said in a statement on X. The seat is rated safe for Democrats by nonpartisan election forecasters. More significantly, Durbin's retirement will reshuffle the chamber's leadership roster, where Durbin and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) have led as the top two Democrats since President Donald Trump first came to power in 2017. The decision of whether to run for re-election has not been easy. It's unclear whether Durbin would get involved in what could become a messy primary. His retirement announcement suggested he may remain neutral. Krishnamoorthi raised $3 million in the first three months of the year, giving him $19 million cash on hand that could be used for a Senate run. JB Pritzker (D-IL) of the Hyatt hotel empire. Durbin has served in Congress for more than 40 years, since 1983, when he began as a congressman, until his election to the Senate in 1996. He made no explicit mention of Trump or Republicans in his retirement message but made clear the stakes he believes are at play in American politics. “The threats to our democracy and way of life are very real,” he said. “And I can assure you, I'll do everything in my power to fight for Illinois and the future of our country every day of my remaining time in the Senate.”</p>

Michel Picaud, president of Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris, shares updates on the restoration of the Notre Dame Cathedral in France five years after a fire shut the site down. It's known for its history as a Christian basilica for almost 1,000 years before becoming a mosque during the Ottoman Empire. In 1935, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founder of the modern Republic of Turkey, transformed Hagia Sophia into a museum. The Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, Turkey, is undergoing renovations to preserve the historic mosque and former church from possible earthquake damage. Mehmet Selim Okten, construction engineer and member of the scientific council overseeing the renovations, told AP a "new phase" of construction is about to begin. The Hagia Sophia is a famous mosque, museum and former church featuring rare Christian mosaics. The renovation comes after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Turkey in 2023, destroying hundreds of buildings. Orkten said construction workers will be able to renovate more safely and "examine the building's layers academically, including damage it suffered from fires and earthquakes in the 10th and 14th centuries," according to AP. The Hagia Sophia receives an average of some 50,000 visitors daily. "A tower crane will be installed on the eastern facade, and then we will cover the top of this unique structure with a protective frame system," he said. The Hagia Sophia receives an average of around 50,000 visitors daily and approximately 6-7 million annually, according to Istanbul Deputy Akturkoglu.

Montgomery County Mom Grace Morrison joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss her ongoing legal battle over the lack of opt-out for LGBTQ+ curriculum in schools. The University of Louisville has reportedly agreed to pay nearly $1.6 million to settle a lawsuit brought by a former professor who was fired for criticizing transgender treatments for children experiencing gender dysphoria. Despite his professional accomplishments, the complaint alleges that Josephson was demoted in 2017 and eventually fired after making comments in his own capacity challenging the push to use hormone therapy and surgery for children with gender dysphoria, according to legal group Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF). ADF, which represented Josephson in court, announced the settlement agreement Monday and hailed the case as a "major victory" for free speech. Child psychiatrist and professor Allan Josephson reached a $1.6 million settlement this week with the University of Louisville after it fired him for criticizing gender treatments for children. "I'm glad to finally receive vindication for voicing what I know is true," Josephson also said in a statement. "Children deserve better than life-altering procedures that mutilate their bodies and destroy their ability to lead fulfilling lives. In spite of the circumstances I suffered through with my university, I'm overwhelmed to see that my case helped lead the way for other medical practitioners to see the universal truth that altering biological sex is impossibly dangerous while acceptance of one's sex leads to flourishing." Upon learning of Josephson's remarks, officials at the university's LGBT center reportedly pressured his division to take disciplinary action against him. Scrutiny of his views intensified after he appeared as an expert witness in a legal case involving a school district's bathroom policy around gender identity. Child psychiatrist Allan Josephson angered colleagues for his expert witness in a case involving gender identity and a school district's bathroom policy. A few of Josephson's colleagues who objected to his remarks pushed for the administration to take disciplinary action against him, the complaint says. According to the complaint, university officials continued to "belittle and berate him," inflicting "irreparable damage to his professional career and reputation," and reduced his salary and benefits, before he was told in February 2019 that his contract would not be renewed, effectively firing him. He alleged the school "retaliated" against him for expressing his views, in violation of his First Amendment rights and right to due process and equal protection under the law. With the six-year legal battle resulting in a favorable settlement, Alliance Defending Freedom filed a stipulated dismissal of the case Monday, court records show. "Hopefully, other public universities will learn from this that if they violate the First Amendment, they can be held accountable, and it can be very expensive," ADF Senior Counsel Travis Barham said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By conventional measures, Donald Trump's second presidency is already descending into disarray amid a legal morass, self-inflicted errors, and a vast gap between its massive ambition and its capacity to enact that vision. Yet Trump's tens of millions of supporters didn't send a conventional president back to the White House – and don't judge their hero's performance by traditional yardsticks. But as Trump attempts to destroy governing structures at home and abroad, chaos is itself a marker of success. So the question, as Trump transitions from the shock-and-awe euphoria start of his second term to grinding out his priorities, becomes what kind of event could cause these two competing realities to collide. Or perhaps it would take a national security crisis precipitated by his volatile leadership and callow foreign policy team to destroy Trump's presidency. Even then, Trump's hold on his supporters is so strong, nothing might shake their confidence even if he alienates the middle-ground voters who helped reelect him. Still, if Trump somehow manages to secure a better deal for US manufacturers with his tariff wars, he might justify the mayhem he's visited on financial markets. If “America first” really does convince Europe to defend itself and the president's vows to forge peace work, the world may end up safer. “You were overwhelmingly elected by the biggest majority … Americans want you to be president,” Attorney General Pam Bondi gushed to Trump last week during a Cabinet meeting, suggesting the Trump team has misread its supposed mandate. Together with a tiny GOP majority in the House, it's a thin political platform on which to base an attempt to simultaneously remake the global geopolitical system and the world trading paradigm; to transform the US government; and to destroy elite establishment centers of power. Weeks ago, the Washington narrative was that Trump's second-term team would be more disciplined and unified than his first. — Backbiting and organizational chaos at the Pentagon came after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed fears about his fitness for the job by posting details of military strikes in Yemen on two Signal chats. — Trump's trade wars have wiped trillions off global stock markets and are likely soon to hike prices for inflation-weary US shoppers. His threats against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have shattered investor confidence. — His purge of first-term officials who knew how Washington worked is resulting in embarrassing accidents. An undocumented migrant from Maryland was deported by mistake to El Salvador, igniting a massive legal showdown. And the administration set off a feud with Harvard University, apparently by mistake. — Trump's claims that the force of his personality alone would end wars made him look foolish. His bullying means many tourists are staying away, frightened by potential harassment at US borders. Allies are making alternative arrangements, thereby diminishing American power. — There has been no blizzard of lawmaking to bolster Trump's claims he's had the most successful first 100 days in generations. How Republicans will pass his huge tax plan is unclear. — Tax season at the Internal Revenue Service was marked by dysfunction, with a revolving door of acting commissioners at the key agency. Massive funding cuts may gut US emergency preparedness as hurricane season approaches. Canceled health research on diseases like cancer may cause unnecessary deaths in years to come. The mistaken firing and hurried rehiring of technicians who look after nuclear weapons seems like an emblem of the Tesla chief's tenure in Washington, which he said on Tuesday he'd soon begin to scale back. The forest of legal challenges has also severely disrupted many of the administration's top priorities, including its signature mass deportation program. The White House, however, insists that such damning assessments do not recognize what it regards as a spectacular record of success. And while Trump world's creation of alternative facts has reached stunning new heights in his second term, there is some logic to their arguments. That lens is the best way to understand his second term. This is not just an ideological goal, although hostility to government is one of the few common themes of two great GOP codes, Reaganism and Trumpism. Many Republican officials believe that the civil service has always been a liberal check on their presidents' power. And if attempts to shatter that stranglehold don't ultimately result in the full dismantling of what Trump first-term political guru Steve Bannon calls the administrative state, then paralyzing government might work almost as well. Trump's belief in almost absolute presidential power horrifies his critics. He made no secret on the campaign trail of his intention to weaponize presidential power and the Justice Department to pursue his enemies. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stoked the fire again on Tuesday. The president was always on the right side of this issue to deport this illegal criminal from our community.” When Trump said last week that he'd like to deport US citizen criminals to El Salvador, he knew his audience. And on this immigration issue, he has some genuine results to show for his efforts. Trump's tariff wars seem insane to Wall Street investors and middle-class Americans who've seen their 401(k) plans plummet. But the Trump administration is betting on a different audience – working Americans in rural areas and states devastated by globalization who helped elect him twice. “We shipped countless jobs overseas and, with them, our capacity to make things – from furniture, appliances, and even weapons of war,” Vice President JD Vance said in India on Tuesday. Trump's America first creed horrifies the foreign policy establishment and threatens to undo generations of US leadership. But those are the same experts who ran the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and are reviled by Trump's base. America's reputation abroad is being slammed by Trump's dismantling of USAID, genuflection to Russian President Vladimir Putin and abandonment of Africa. But Trump and his supporters care little for allies. A veteran of those early 21st-century wars, Hegseth now runs the Pentagon. His defenestration of senior uniformed officers who advocated diversity might be unfairly wrecking military careers and rocking the leadership of the world's most lethal military. But the former Fox News anchor has the support of conservative media – one reason Trump is standing by him despite reports of his cavalier attitude to classified information. Leavitt hinted at the strategy behind Hegseth's selection and retention on Tuesday, saying, “There's a lot of people in this city who reject monumental change, and I think, frankly, that's why we've seen a smear campaign against the secretary of defense since the moment that President Trump announced his nomination before the United States Senate.” A similar distaste for the establishment also explains Trump's showdown with Harvard. If Democrats chose to defend these bastions of elitism, so much the better for Trump's political cause. History will form its own judgments on the second term of Trump. But as the daily pandemonium unfolds, it's worth remembering that this divisive presidency can look like a dangerous failure to half the country while manifesting as a stunning success to the other half. If America was ever united by a common version of reality, that's no longer the case.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A defiant Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth booked himself on the television network where he used to work as a host Tuesday morning in a bid to address the fallout over revelations that he discussed military plans in a second Signal group chat, this time with his wife and brother. Yet President Donald Trump is unlikely to dismiss Hegseth and has spoken to him twice since The New York Times and CNN reported on the second Signal group on Sunday night. In their first call, Trump said he had Hegseth's back and voiced frustration at “leakers” he said were trying to damage his administration, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Trump has since been soliciting feedback from people around him about Hegseth's performance during conversations, according to two people familiar with the comments. So far, most, if not all, has been positive about the Pentagon chief. Trump is extremely hesitant to fire any Cabinet official at this point in his term, much less Hegseth, given how hard his team fought to get him confirmed in the first place. Others close to Hegseth, including his adviser, retired Army Sgt. Maj. Eric Geressy — who served with Hegseth in Iraq and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross last month — have gotten so frustrated by the turmoil that they have indicated to colleagues that they may resign, two of the sources said. Some of Hegseth's closest former advisers have issued warnings this week about turmoil inside the Pentagon. They include his former spokesman John Ullyot and three former senior officials Hegseth fired last week: top adviser Dan Caldwell; deputy chief of staff Darin Selnick; and Colin Carroll, who was chief of staff to the deputy secretary of defense. “It's been a month of total chaos at the Pentagon. From leaks of sensitive operational plans to mass firings, the dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president — who deserves better from his senior leadership,” Ullyot said in a statement obtained by CNN. One congressional Republican, Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, escalated his public calls Tuesday for Hegseth to be held accountable. Asked Tuesday by CNN's Jake Tapper on “The Lead” what he would do if he were president and his defense secretary had acted as Hegseth did, Bacon said, “I would hold them accountable, and I'd fire them.” Putting sensitive information on an application like Signal, Bacon said, was “very foolish,” but Hegseth's response — describing the chat earlier Tuesday on Fox as “informal, unclassified coordinations for media coordination and other things” — exacerbated the offense. Carroll's firing has also strained Hegseth's relationship with Deputy Secretary of Defense Steve Feinberg, who brought Carroll on as his chief of staff and was not consulted before he was placed on leave, the sources said. “He is in full paranoia, back-against-the-wall mode,” said one of the sources familiar with Hegseth's state of mind over the last month. Hegseth's now-former chief of staff, Joe Kasper, had repeatedly clashed in recent months with the three men Hegseth dismissed last week, the sources told CNN. Several West Wing staffers had grown frustrated about what they described to others as Kasper's lack of responsiveness, often complaining about the difficulty in getting Hegseth's chief of staff on the phone or to respond to their requests. But Hegseth did not first run the idea through a policy process that included lawyers, the people said, and ultimately, DoD ethics lawyers in the Standards of Conduct office said it would not be appropriate. Caldwell and Selnick, who have known Hegseth for years and worked with him at the conservative veterans organization Concerned Veterans for America, came to believe Kasper was isolating Hegseth and turning him against them, the sources said. Kasper, in turn, has told people he doesn't know where those accusations are coming from — it was Hegseth who launched the leak investigation that led to their firings, according to Kasper. Kasper is no longer Hegseth's chief of staff, and is in the process of moving into a new position as a special government employee, according to the person familiar. He's a great American,” Hegseth said Tuesday during the interview on Fox News, adding, “He's staying with us, going to be in a slightly different role, but he's not going anywhere, certainly not fired.” The former employees in question had been handpicked by Hegseth to serve on his leadership team, but he suggested in the Fox interview that his loyalty to them had run out. Caldwell this week denied leaking information, and said he hadn't been questioned or polygraphed as part of any investigation. “I have been a friend and supporter of Pete Hegseth for a long time, and I'm just personally devastated by this. It's just awful,” he told Tucker Carlson on his podcast. “The entire Department of Defense cannot continue to be consumed by chaos.” In his own interview on Fox, Hegseth listed a number of recent stories he suggested came about due to leaks from his staff, including plans for a US takeover of the Panama Canal and a scheduled briefing for Musk on war plans against China. Hegseth suggested he wanted to keep those issues out of the media. But one of them — the report about plans to brief Musk — came as a surprise to Trump himself, who ordered the briefing for Musk be canceled. While Trump's aides think the Signal matter has been sufficiently resolved, some have said they still believe there could be more to emerge about Hegseth's leadership of the Defense Department that would prove embarrassing or worse.</p>

Robert Turner hit the road from his home in Baltimore last week and traveled — on foot — 43 miles (69 kilometers) to Washington. This time, Turner added another stop on his long day's journey — the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Turner knelt in prayer and laid a wreath at the entrance of the museum in support of its mission, which incurred President Donald Trump's criticism alongside other Smithsonian Institution sites. “I laid my wreath down there to show solidarity with the museum and the history that they present every day,” said Turner, pastor of Empowerment Temple African Methodist Episcopal Church in Baltimore. Membership costs start at $25 per year, according to an online form on the museum site. His church is not alone, as other predominantly Black congregations are taking similar steps. Pastor Robert Turner walks past the National Museum of African American History and Culture as part of his monthly walk from Baltimore to Washington to raise awareness of reparations on Wednesday, April 16, 2025, in Washington. Otis Moss III of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, whose church also joined the museum and who urged members to do the same. “For only $25 a year, you can protect Black history,” Moss told his church. Jacqui J. Lewis, senior minister at Middle Church in New York City — home to a multiracial congregation affiliated with the United Church of Christ. “We belonged to the museum since its opening, and we just made another donation to them in light of this administration's policies,” she told the AP. The gift, she said, was a $1,000 “Easter Love donation.” Bishop Timothy Clarke of the First Church of God in Columbus, Ohio, said he would be emulating Moss in making an appeal to his predominantly African American congregation. Trump's order didn't specifically talk about budget cuts, though it tasked Vice President JD Vance, a member of the Smithsonian Board of Regents by virtue of his office, to lead the effort to purge “improper ideology” from such institutions. He pledged to “restore the Smithsonian Institution to its rightful place as a symbol of inspiration and American greatness.” Critics say he's trying to force a distorted national narrative that glosses over slavery and other historical wrongs. Turner said he has been making his walk to Washington one day for each of the past 31 months. He's calling for the U.S. to make reparations for the legacy of slavery, Jim Crow segregation and other systemic suffering inflicted on Black people, ranging from housing and medical discrimination to mass incarceration. Turner said when he arrived last week outside the White House, a crowd of visitors was milling about, and one child who noticed his sign asked a parent, “What is reparations?” “That to me is a perfect manifestation about why we need to be teaching more true history of America, and not taking away certain subjects because they make people feel uncomfortable,” Turner said. Moss, in a social media post, held out hope that the museum could continue its current course, noting that Vance is just one member of the board. Trinity has long been socially active with a wide array of community outreaches, and Moss describes it as “a church that is unashamedly Black and unapologetically Christian.” Jeremiah Wright, while affirming the Black Church tradition of speaking out against injustice. The African American museum, one of 21 Smithsonian museums, has also seen a recent shake-up in leadership. Shanita Beckett, who was previously the head of operations at the museum, has been widely reported to be serving as interim director.

We focus on being useful to you — breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Twenty years ago, few people would have been able to imagine the energy landscape of today. In 2005, US oil production, after a long decline, had fallen to its lowest levels in decades, and few experts thought that would change. The US invasion of Iraq had sent gasoline prices skyward. Solar and wind power provided a tiny fraction of overall electricity, showing moderate growth every year. Americans were beginning to rethink their love of giant cars as the 7,000-pound Ford Excursion SUV entered its final year of production. In short, the US was preparing for a world with a rising demand for ever scarcer, more expensive fossil fuels, most of which would have to come from abroad. Today, the energy picture couldn't be more different. Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which created new incentives to deploy wind and solar power. Just about every carmaker now has an electric vehicle for sale. These weren't just the product of steady advances but breakthroughs — new inventions, policies, and expanding economies of scale that aligned prices and performance to push energy technologies to unexpected heights. That's the challenge for those charged with building tomorrow's energy infrastructure. And right now, the world is especially uncertain about what's to come, with overall energy demand experiencing major growth for the first time in decades, in part due to power-hungry data centers behind AI. If you're running a utility, building a factory, or designing power transmission routes, how do you even begin to plan? She has studied technology and policy changes in the energy sector for decades, with an eye toward how to make big decisions under uncertain circumstances. I asked her about whether there are any other big step changes on the horizon for technologies that can help us contain climate change, and what we can do to stack the deck in their favor. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Can you define “breakthrough” or explain how it's different from an incremental advance? A lot of really important innovation has been incremental. An example of a kind of a breakthrough was fracking, because that was a revolution, but for a long time, everybody ignored the importance of all the various technologies horizontal drilling, shale fracture fluid, subsurface mapping] developing in the background, or didn't think it was going to happen. That one was a big step change when the price, performance, and shale gas field discoveries converged. Whereas with solar, it just kept getting cheaper consistently faster than we expected. Then can you put the recent clean tech advances we've seen into context? I think that we've always had a lot of technological change. I don't think it's just around clean energy. If there is some kind of incentive, then energy developers will be very clever at finding solutions. As we realize that renewable energy has a lot of benefits to it, the more we focused on it, the more we were like, “Whoa, this is 10 times better than anybody thought it was going to be.” With clean energy, a big part of the rationale is its environmental and climate benefits, rather than simply profit. There's sort of a moral motivation baked in. For many technologies, there are always true believers. Most people who get really excited about an invention are not just trying to make a profit. I think they're almost always really into the technology itself. Solar took a long time for it to become great. The reason people focused on it was because of their vision that this has such potential for energy and the environment. So I think that the moral dimension does play a role. With a trade war kicking off, a lot of the raw materials and finished products in clean energy are likely to get more expensive. Is there a chance of backsliding in clean energy progress? I don't think we're going to lose the technology advances. We're not losing any benefits of the technology though, and in fact it will probably induce new technological change. To me those kinds of things are temporary. Trade wars and stuff like that, they're bad. You talked about fracking and how that was an unexpected breakthrough. I remember in the 1990s people were talking about peak oil, and then that discussion went away because we just kept finding more oil and more exploitable resources. Yeah, that peak oil thing used to drive me crazy. When it was a big thing, what I kept trying to explain to people that the industry will just innovate. There could be more innovations in fossil fuels, but where we are in the US, climate change is a very real problem and it's hitting people today. I think that the majority of focus on innovation is going to be things that can help us deal with climate change while living high-quality lives. Being at a university, I see that the young bright students are not dying to get into fossil fuels. Young people want to make a better world. How do we start planning for another step change in clean energy? Investing in science and engineering is obviously a good idea if we want to have more kinds of scientific breakthroughs. But yeah, given that we don't know what the technology of tomorrow is going to look like, we really want to focus on flexibility and adaptability in the near term. Something that I think is important but not always very sexy or appealing is to streamline the grid interconnection process. That process is really slow and inefficient; it can take years and years for things to get on the grid. Similarly, we need to build new transmission where and when it's needed. It would be independent of where we end up on the energy supply side. Some of these battery technologies are facilitating distributed resources like rooftop solar and microgrids. Thinking about just how to integrate them on the main power grid would be useful. What do you see as the government's role in facilitating this? A lot of it is also setting goals for specific technologies. It doesn't even cost very much money. A lot of it is reviewing and streamlining regulatory processes to make sure that regulation is doing what it should do. What about things like investing in companies or offering financing to startups? One thing that I think is really interesting is the idea of green bonds so that you can borrow money at a lower interest rate when what you're doing is good for the environment. I don't think that involves the government exactly picking companies; it just means you're making this money available if you follow certain guidelines. For energy project developers, how do you decide whether to use what you can get off the shelf now versus waiting a few years, maybe another decade, for something better? A friend of mine many years ago did some research on that, and basically she found that if things are improving at a pretty fast rate, it's almost always worth it to go ahead and invest in what you have now because you're going to get a lot of value out of it. Yes, it's possible that 10 years from now, it'll be something even better, but you're already getting a lot of value from what you're doing. I don't see many developers waiting around for a better technology. I think we have a lot of good options. A star-studded film explains the hope and hype behind regenerative agriculture.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration appears open to negotiations with Harvard, even after America's most prestigious university sued the federal government – setting up a clash over academic freedom, federal funding and campus oversight. Last week, administration officials reached out to Harvard representatives three times in an effort to restart talks, a person familiar with the outreach told CNN. Barring a settlement, the legal showdown over frozen federal funds will likely take years to play out and could end up at the Supreme Court. The administration intends to continue a dialogue with Harvard, said Education Secretary Linda McMahon, insisting the White House's recent demands are not about curbing freedom of speech. Related article Harvard's fight with the Trump administration is just getting started. “The Government has not – and cannot – identify any rational connection between antisemitism concerns and the medical, scientific, technological, and other research it has frozen that aims to save American lives, foster American success, preserve American security, and maintain America's position as a global leader in innovation,” said the lawsuit, filed in Boston federal court. The case has been assigned to US District Court Judge Allison Burroughs, an Obama nominee who was involved in a previous landmark case involving the university. Burroughs, who did not earn her bachelor's or law degree from Harvard, upheld Harvard's admissions process in a 2019 ruling that was overturned by the Supreme Court's landmark decision ending race-conscious admissions in American colleges. “(S)huttering apolitical, life-saving research; targeting the university's tax-exempt status; and threatening all student visas … is neither focused nor measured, and stands to substantially harm the very Jewish students and scholars it purports to protect,” Harvard Hillel wrote Saturday. In March, the federal government sent a letter to Harvard saying the school was being investigated for its failures to “curb or combat” antisemitism on campus. A similar letter with demands for policy changes had been sent to Columbia University, and federal agencies soon announced a review of more than $5 billion in grants to the Ivy League school. The White House continued targeting universities — Princeton, Cornell and Northwestern all had funds frozen or suspended — and on April 11 sent Harvard a list of policy changes it wanted implemented, demanding “immediate cooperation” if the university wanted to “maintain Harvard's financial relationship with the federal government.” Related article Analysis: The real stakes in Trump's confrontation with Harvard A New York Times report suggested the letter inadvertently had been sent prematurely. Still, Harvard put out a response three days later, publicly rebuking the Trump administration, saying it would not “surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.” The Trump administration retaliated by freezing $2.2 billion in multiyear grants and contracts, making plans to rescind Harvard's tax-exempt status and threatening the school's ability to host international students. If the case were to end up at the Supreme Court, it would be heard by a bench that includes four Harvard alumni: liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, along with Justice Neil Gorsuch and Chief Justice John Roberts, both conservatives. Justices are unlikely to recuse themselves from a case based solely on having studied at an institution involved. Jackson recused herself from a case involving affirmative action at Harvard because she was on the school's board of overseers; the other three Harvard alumni ruled in that groundbreaking case. “I think Harvard, for now, is insisting on treatment that's consistent with law,” former US Treasury Secretary and former Harvard University President Larry Summers told CNN's Kaitlan Collins Tuesday. Billions of dollars, along with jobs, research and Harvard's ability to administer financial aid are not the only things at stake. Garber signed a letter with more than 100 presidents of colleges, universities and scholarly societies, opposing the Trump administration's pressure on academic institutions. Related video Hear what three Harvard students said about Trump administration threats “As leaders of America's colleges, universities, and scholarly societies, we speak with one voice against the unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American higher education,” said the letter released Tuesday by the American Association of Colleges and Universities. “We are open to constructive reform and do not oppose legitimate government oversight. However, we must oppose undue government intrusion in the lives of those who learn, live, and work on our campuses,” wrote the presidents – including leaders of Princeton and American universities – adding, “The price of abridging the defining freedoms of American higher education will be paid by our students and our society.” “I made it very clear that these are not First Amendment infractions. This is making sure that students on all campuses can come and learn and be safe … and that is why we have had these funds either withheld or frozen during this period of time of negotiation,” she said on CNBC's “Squawk Box.” Related video ‘An unprecedented assault': Legal scholar says White House attacks on Harvard are threat to democracy McMahon did not respond directly to a question about whether the Trump administration's demand in its April 11 letter for “viewpoint diversity” among Harvard students, faculty and departments, to be audited by a third party, is really about free speech. We would like to have viewpoint diversity,” the education secretary replied. The letter, she added, “was intended to have both parties sit down again and continue their negotiations.” “I think that Harvard is encouraging many others to stand up, because when we win – and we will – they will realize that going along with dictatorial demands doesn't get them anywhere,” Tribe told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday. Harvard, the world's wealthiest university, has an endowment of $53 billion, which could help cushion cuts. About 80% of that money is earmarked for financial aid, scholarships, faculty chairs, academic programs or other projects, according to the school. But the lawsuit paints a bleak picture of that future if Harvard has to dip into university coffers for too long. Eventually, Harvard will be left operating at “a significantly reduced level,” the complaint says. The Trump administration's threats against Harvard's tax-exempt status and its ability to host international students could put even more pressure on the university's funding, and more federal money could get withheld. The National Institutes of Health announced Monday it would pull medical research funding from universities with diversity and inclusion programs. Research on childhood cancer, infectious disease outbreaks and how to ease the pain of soldiers wounded on the battlefield would all be affected, Garber added. Harvard's many partnerships with other universities, private companies, and state and local agencies mean the freeze on funding will touch off widespread economic harm, the lawsuit argues, noting, “Harvard is one of Massachusetts' largest employers.” CNN's Shania Shelton, Brad Lendon, Matthew Rehbein, Andy Rose, Michelle Krupa and John Fritze contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A delegation of congressional members traveled to Louisiana Tuesday to demand the release of Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk and inspect conditions at the two Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities where the two remain in custody. It's the first time a congressional delegation has met with Khalil or Ozturk. Troy Carter of Louisiana traveled to Jena, where Khalil is being held, and then two hours south to Basile, where Ozturk is detained. The facilities were clean but “chilly” according to Carter, who said detainees complained of cold temperatures at night, making it difficult to sleep. Following the visit, lawmakers said the detainees they met with also complained about a lack of medical care, food and religious accommodations. McGovern referred to Khalil and Ozturk as “political prisoners.” “I really worry that this administration is ushering in a new era of McCarthyism. Markey accused the Trump administration of wanting to “make an example” out of Khalil and Ozturk in an effort to chill free speech. Markey also said ICE had intentionally transferred them to Louisiana for political reasons. Through the Trump administration, ICE feels “they have a right to take people from across our country, and to put them into facilities like this here in Louisiana,” Markey said. They have done that in order to go to the single most conservative Circuit Court of Appeals in the United States of America.” “Rümeysa Öztürk is my constituent, an accomplished scholar, and a valued member of our Massachusetts community. Like Rümeysa, Mahmoud Kahlil has committed no crime and is being punished by Donald Trump simply for exercising his right to free speech,” Pressley said in a statement to CNN prior to the visits. Related article Harvard's lawsuit sets up monumental clash between America's most prestigious university and the Trump administration Neither Khalil or Ozturk has been charged with a crime. Ozturk, a Turkish national, has experienced multiple asthma attacks while in custody and has not had access to her medication, according to court documents and her attorneys. Tuesday's visit follows a series of recent trips by Washington lawmakers who have traveled to visit people who are in custody as a result of Trump's immigration crackdown. US Sen. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, met Monday with Mohsen Madawi, a prominent organizer of pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University who was detained during his final citizenship interview in Vermont last week. Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland traveled to El Salvador last week where he met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent believes the United States's trade war with China will wind down soon. Bessent gave the remarks in a private speech in Washington, D.C., for JPMorgan Chase, adding that the conflict is not “sustainable.” “I do say China is going to be a slog in terms of the negotiations,” Bessent said, according to a transcript of his remarks obtained by the Associated Press. The current situation is essentially a trade embargo, Bessent suggested. President Donald Trump and his administration are negotiating with several countries/unions on deals regarding the tariffs, including Japan, South Korea, the European Union, and others. Trump said the U.S. was “doing fine” with China when asked about Bessent's comments, adding that he did not anticipate a “hardball” negotiation. “They're going to be very nice, and we'll see what happens. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump also told her that the U.S. was “doing very well in respect to a potential trade deal with China.” She added that 18 different nations had brought trade offers to the White House and the president's trade team was meeting with 34 countries this week about possible agreements. The market, which has wavered on tariff news, surged after Bessent's comments. The S&P 500 index closed on Tuesday up about 2.5%.</p>
