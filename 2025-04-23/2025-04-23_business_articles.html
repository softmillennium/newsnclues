Elon Musk's DOGE:

International Business Machines Corp. dropped in extended trading after its results weren't strong enough to quell investors' concerns that tariffs and federal cost cuts will dent the company's business.

First-quarter sales increased almost 1% to $14.5 billion, IBM said Wednesday in a statementBloomberg Terminal. Profit, excluding some items, was $1.60 per share. Both results exceeded analysts' average estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

Big banks like Citigroup and Natixis thought they were backing a $1 billion fintech darling. But when Stenn blew up, most of its supposed partners said they had never worked with the company.

Every week during the years leading up to its sudden collapse in December, Stenn Technologies sent an email to some of the world's biggest finance firms.

The emails contained pages of data from a trade-finance deal that London-based Stenn had arranged that grew to almost $1 billion in size, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg and people familiar with the matter. Citigroup Inc., BNP Paribas SA, Natixis and HSBC Holdings Plc were among the biggest investors while Barclays Plc, M&G Plc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s asset-management unit had also backed the transaction. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Businesses dealing with the early stages of President Donald Trump's tariffs are looking for ways to pass increasing costs onto consumers, according to a Federal Reserve report Wednesday. As Trump ordered against-the-board levies on U.S. imports and higher duties on Chinese products, the Fed's Beige Book indicated how they plan to proceed. "Most Districts noted that firms expected elevated input cost growth resulting from tariffs," the report said. "Many firms have already received notices from suppliers that costs would be increasing." Broadly speaking, the report, which comes out about every seven weeks, characterized economic growth as "little changed" from the March 5 report, though it noted that "uncertainty around international trade policy was pervasive across" the Fed's 12 districts. Employment was "little changed" amid falling headcounts in government jobs. "Firms reported adding tariff surcharges or shortening pricing horizons to account for uncertain trade policy," the report stated. However, there were reports about margin compression amid increased costs, as demand remained tepid in some sectors, especially for consumer-facing firms." Manufacturers and distributors said they already are adding surcharges due to shipments. There also were signs of problems in the trade dispute with Canada. Tourists are booking fewer hotel rooms in New York City and at least one tech firm reported losing business contacts in Canada. "The outlook for service sector firms worsened noticeably, with contacts anticipating a sharp decline in activity in the coming months. Service sector firms reported a major pullback in planned investment," the report said. While the employment picture overall was "unchanged" for the period, "many federal government workers were laid off or put on administrative leave in recent weeks." For example, a research organization headquartered outside the DC-region laid off workers due to contracts being cancelled. Similarly, a Northern Virginia consultancy reduced headcount by 25 percent due to losing half their contracts," the report added. Elsewhere in the report, service organizations dependent on government support noted difficulties since the White House began culling through agencies that get federal aid. "Contacts at non-profits and other community-based organizations expressed significant concern about the future of federal funding and services support, creating challenges in staffing, strategy, and planning," the report said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Discord co-founder and CEO Jason Citron is stepping down from the gaming-focused social messaging service, the startup said Wednesday. Citron will be replaced by former Activision Blizzard Vice Chairman Humam Sakhnini, who will assume the reigns as Discord CEO and join the company's board on Monday. Citron will remain on Discord's board and become an advisor to the CEO, the company said. In a public memo to employees, Citron said "it feels like the right time" to move on from the executive role and that the company has a "clear strategy, new business lines to grow into, love and passion from our users, and an incredible team of people working tirelessly to deliver for them." "The job of a CEO is constantly evolving, and over the years I have continuously 'hired myself out of a job,'" Citron wrote. "Usually that means delegating work and then taking on different leadership challenges. However, as I look at what is needed of Discord's CEO over the next few years, I realize that it's time for me to literally 'hire myself out of a job.'" Citron credited Sakhnini's 15-year experience in the video game industry as helping steer the startup he co-founded alongside Chief Technology Officer Stanislav Vishnevskiy in 2012, when it was initially a gaming studio before its 2015 pivot to online communications. At Activision Blizzard, Sakhnini helped oversee major gaming franchises such as World of Warcraft, Call of Duty and Candy Crush, the company said. Discord's executive change comes amid media reports that it met with investment bankers to discuss a possible initial product offering as soon as this year. A Discord spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that it does "not comment on rumors or speculation" and that it is focused on "delivering the best possible experience for our users and building a strong, sustainable business." A member of CNBC's Disruptor 50 list, Discord has roughly 200 million global monthly active users who access its "servers" to discuss shared interests using text, voice or video. Discord has raised a total of $1.1 billion and is valued at around $14.7 billion, according to PitchBook. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An internal email sent to Microsoft managers on Friday disclosed the company's new "globally consistent" performance improvement plan with "clear expectations and a timeline for improvement." Affected employees can enter the PIP or quit and accept a "Global Voluntary Separation Agreement (GVSA)," the email, viewed by Business Insider, said. "This performance improvement process is available year-round so you can act quickly to transparently address performance issues, while offering employees choice," said the email, which was from  Amy Coleman, Microsoft's new chief people officer. Another internal Microsoft document viewed by BI said that the payout to employees would be equal to 16 weeks of pay. Microsoft's approach is similar to Amazon's Pivot program, which offers a PIP option or a payout if the employee leaves. BI has reported extensively on Pivot, a central cog in a broader Amazon performance review system that some employees have said is designed to meet firing quotas rather than revive careers. Amazon has defended its system in the past. In 2021, the company told BI that it provided managers "with tools to help employees improve their performance and grow in their careers." It added: "This includes resources for employees who are not meeting expectations and may require additional coaching." The latest changes come as Microsoft, and the tech industry overall, shifts toward more rigorous performance expectations and less coddling. Earlier this year, Microsoft fired 2,000 employees deemed underperformers without severance. Leaders in at least some parts of the company are considering additional performance-based cuts as soon as May. They're looking at cutting middle managers and how to increase the ratio of coders versus noncoders on projects.</p>

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said US tariffs may be more disinflationary than inflationary for Europe even as more time is needed to fully assess the situation.

“It is very unclear what the net impact will be,” she said at a Washington Post event. “Particularly if there is no countermeasures decided by Europe, I think the net inflation is uncertain at the moment, but probably it's going to be disinflationary more than inflationary.”</p>

The US Department of Health and Human Services said Tuesday it plans to work with food companies to phase out use of many artificial food colorings by 2026, but industry lobbyists say there's no agreement in place to remove the dyes, according to people familiar with the matter.

In its announcement, HHS said it planned to eliminate artificial food dyes by working with companies that rely heavily on them. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said his agency and the Food and Drug Administration had an “understanding” with the industry about their removal on a voluntary basis. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Caroline Smith, an accounting director from Verona, New Jersey, and her husband took their two children to Italy for Easter break this month. On the Spanish Steps in Rome, they ran into another family from their town. The U.S. Travel Association on Jan. 9 said it expected a more than 12% increase in spending from international tourism in the United States this year. An on-again, off-again trade war, high-profile detentions of visitors as well as visa holders and permanent residents, along with President Donald Trump's rhetoric about taking over countries like Canada, and a strong U.S. dollar for much of this year and travel warnings haven't helped drum up demand from international travelers. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. "This points to potentially another channel to consider in assessing the effect of tariffs on economic activity," JPMorgan said in a note Wednesday, adding that a decline in foreign travel spending could subtract around 0.1% from the gross domestic product this year. "Concerns around detentions of foreign visitors, sometimes by accident, are only compounding this effect." Samuel Engel, senior vice president at consulting firm ICF, said that while "there's no question that foreigners are finding the U.S. less welcoming" another question is if the hesitance to travel to the U.S. from abroad is now showing up in international business travel. "Business people don't ink deals in the face of uncertainty," he said. United Airlines last week said bookings from international passengers originating in Europe are down 6%, while those originating in Canada are down 9% year over year. Delta Air Lines said it was seeing a similar phenomenon. But American consumers' appetite for international trips is helping to soften the blow of fewer international tourists and weaker-than-expected demand in domestic U.S. travel for some companies, like United and Delta, which are cutting back flights within the United States later this year. Grace Cular Yee, a travel agent based in Virginia, said a lot of her clients are considering international travel more than domestic in part because they're wanting to splash out on college graduation trips since their kids largely missed out on high school commencement celebrations during Covid. "This is a major milestone for the whole family," she said, adding that while many travelers get ideas from social media, more Americans are also getting inspired by television shows, like the latest season of "The White Lotus," which was set in Thailand. She said she recently planned a trip to France for a mother-daughter high school graduation trip because the daughter loves the show "Emily in Paris." United said that advanced bookings earlier this month are stable and premium-cabin sales are up 17%, while international demand has risen 5%. Delta's president, Glen Hauenstein, is optimistic that the trend will continue and said cash sales for international travel are coming in ahead of the same point last year. "Sales that are coming in the door as of yesterday that we're recording today as cash are very strong for international through the summer all the way out to September, October," he said on an April 9 earnings call, adding that international sales were up on the year. Many working Americans and retirees are on edge with recent market tumult, but wealthy and aging travelers, particularly in the pricey front of the plane, are helping to offset that. "Being a baby boomer, I can say this without fear of retribution: There's only so much time to go to Europe or almost so much time to go see Australia or Japan," Hauenstein said on the earnings call. "So you've got this wealth effect where this cohort of retirees is wealthier than any other cohort even with the most recent rundown, and they want to go do things." It isn't clear whether a pullback in consumer spending in the back of the plane or even some softness in corporate travel growth is a sign that high-end, international leisure travel bookings will weaken, too. "Everybody's life is not fully disrupted but everybody's life is on more tenuous footing right now," said ICF's Engel. "The way people manage uncertainty is they hold back on decisions."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DEARBORN, Mich. — Ford Motor is launching a program that aims to give its most premium pickup truck customers a more curated, exclusive experience. The Detroit automaker's new ownership experience is for its "Platinum Plus" customers. The program ranges from offering a personal concierge and virtual tutorial tours to gifts, accessory discounts and a "Ford Protect Premium Maintenance Plan" for 25,000 miles or two years, whichever comes first. It replaces "Limited" models as the priciest pickups for Ford. "We think it's a competitive advantage, this whole experience. So we're excited about that potential to grow that into the future," Brian Rathsburg, marketing manager for Ford F-Series Super Duty, said during an event Tuesday. And we're excited to kind of start with this concept." The new program essentially groups together many services Ford was offering owners individually, while adding a few new ones. Rathsburg said the program will adapt to include whatever experiences customers want. In addition to the new program, the Platinum Plus vehicles feature plush "Smoked Truffle" interiors that include Venetian leather and unique exterior design features such as a satin finish grille with bright chrome inserts. Rathsburg declined to discuss if President Donald Trump's 25% auto tariffs will impact the price of its F-Series Super Duty pickups, including the new Platinum Plus offering. Ford last week told dealers it could increase prices on newly built vehicles next month if Trump doesn't ease tariffs on automotive imports, according to Automotive News. That comes after the company has been offering an employee pricing program to promote its U.S. operations, which are the largest among automakers. The auto industry has offered more curated, exclusive services in the past, but they have largely been for luxury and premium brands rather than mainstream brands or vehicles like Ford's F-Series. The new service package follows Ford betting big on such curated services for its "Pro" fleet customers, including more hands-on assistance as well as logistics and fleet management. "Everything we see says that this is gonna be a nice improvement for consumers," Rathsburg said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European Union has fined Apple and Meta a combined $800 million for violating antitrust laws. Meta even argues that Europe is attacking America itself. "The European Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards," Meta comms and policy head Joel Kaplan said in a statement Wednesday. Apple also weighed in: "Today's announcements are yet another example of the European Commission unfairly targeting Apple in a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free." In Meta's case, Europe says the company didn't offer a version of its services that uses less of consumers' personal data. Both complaints preceded Donald Trump's second presidential victory. But both Apple and Meta are clearly hoping that Trump sees them as something that can be negotiated away as part of his administration's tariff wars. Something like "Europe drops these charges against US tech companies, and the US cuts back on the 20% tariff it's planning to levy on Europe." At various times, that has seemed like something Trump and his team are interested in pursuing. Like in February, when Trump issued a memo, written with Europe in mind, vowing to "defend American companies and innovators from overseas extortion." And there's speculation that the EU, which could have fined both Apple and Meta up to 10% of their total annual revenue, came down with much smaller fines because it didn't want to aggravate tariff tensions. Except … that same Trump administration has been causing headaches of its own for Big Tech companies. Its on-again/off-again tariffs could cause the price of Apple products to skyrocket, depending on how or if they are implemented. They could also damage Meta by cutting off billions in ad dollars from Chinese companies. Perhaps the most generous way of interpreting them would be something like: The White House wants to keep Big Tech in line — but it wants to do it itself. As we've learned, trying to predict what the Trump administration is going to do about just about anything — and especially on trade — is a very difficult task. On Wednesday, for instance, markets are surging in part because Trump just signaled that he's going to soften his approach to China. But maybe that will be different Thursday or next week.</p>

Apple Antitrust Cases:

The Apple App Store.

Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. were hit by relatively modest European Union fines totaling €700 million ($798 million) for violating tough new antitrust rules for Big Tech, following warnings of harsh retaliation from US President Donald Trump.

EU regulators levied the penalties — €500 million against Apple and €200 million against Meta — under its Digital Markets Act, which includes a list of dos and don'ts mainly aimed at Silicon Valley giants.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BAE Systems says it's about to radically increase its production of 155mm shells, leaning on advances in how it produces munitions. The UK defense contractor said its new production methods are a "major breakthrough" that will allow it to reach a sixteenfold increase in 155mm shell manufacturing by the summer. As a result, it says it will not only be able to meet the UK's demand, but will also begin to supply for export by the end of 2026. The announcement comes amid ongoing anxiety about the UK's stockpiles of key ammunition, having sent Ukraine half a million artillery rounds as of February this year. It also appears to address a wider global scramble toward reducing dependence on imports and having homegrown access to critical resources and manufacturing capabilities. BAE Systems' new approach is twofold, affecting the production of both explosives and propellants for shells. A new formulation for propellants has been developed, it said, reducing the need for nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin, compounds that are in high demand across multiple industries worldwide. BAE Systems has until now been reliant on the US and France for its supply of RDX. He added that the company's ambition is likely to be "to control costs at lower production rates, and to be able to surge production levels by operating more hours when needed without a large labor force that would be idle in less pressing times." BAE Systems, like other British defense companies, works in line with the UK Ministry of Defence's priorities and does not sell to the UK's adversaries — meaning that the new system is not likely to end up in Russian hands anytime soon. The company says it's invested £163.5 million, or about $220 million, in new manufacturing sites and tech over the last five years.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian drone operators flying their uncrewed aircraft against the threat of Russian jamming are often unsure where their drones actually are, meaning they have to use other guideposts to find their way, an operator told Business Insider. Directional landmarks can include "weird-looking buildings" or intersections. Operators use these when they can't use GPS to locate themselves and can't be sure exactly where their drones are over fields and treelines that look similar, Dimko Zhluktenko, a drone operator with Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces, told BI. GPS, a satellite-based navigation system, is used in munitions, drones, and civilian technology like digital maps. It plays an essential function in military systems and civilian society, but military leaders are increasingly coming to terms with the reality that modern battlefields may be GPS-denied environments. "At the front line, there is literally no GPS," Zhluktenko said. Electronic warfare can make location data unreliable, and wind and other factors can knock a drone off course, out of sync with the operator's expectations. "And that's why you have to look at the visual markers that you have from the camera: a lake, some weird-looking building, weird intersection, and you just discuss all those markers and use them to navigate through the front line basically." That's not an easy task, and in some sectors of the front, this can be extremely difficult. Eastern Ukraine, where most of the fighting is taking place, is very flat and has a largely uniform landscape, making it hard for operators to find those standout features and learn where they are. It's the same kind of field, the same kind of forest, and there are literally no visual markers to figure out where you're at." The flat landscape has also made other parts of warfare more difficult, like tank and armored assaults. Another Ukrainian drone operator, who spoke to BI on the condition of anonymity, shared similar experiences, explaining that without GPS, drone operators "have to get oriented using benchmarks." From quadcopters to octocopters to large fixed-wing aircraft, drones are running reconnaissance operations, collecting targeting data, dropping bombs, and exploding on targets, and that's just the aerial ones. These relatively cheap weapons have eliminated assets worth millions of dollars and destroyed targets far from the front. And they have been key for Ukraine, which has suffered from shortages of other weaponry. Maj. Gen. Peter Boysen, the commander in chief in Denmark, a significant Ukrainian partner, said this month that attack drones account for more than 70% of Ukrainian kills. The proliferation of drones means that Russian and Ukrainian industries are in a race to find ways to jam and stop the other country's drones. New drone systems include fiber-optic drones, which have a cable between the operator and the drone that prevents them from being jammed, and AI-enabled drones.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some analysts are concerned that Amazon Web Services, the dominant cloud provider, may be entering a digestion phase that could slow momentum in the data center market. The speculation gained traction Monday when the famed short seller Jim Chanos posted a simple and ominous remark on X, alongside an analyst note suggesting caution around AWS's data center plans. That note, published by Wells Fargo analysts, cited industry sources who reported this weekend that AWS paused discussions for certain new colocation data center deals, particularly international ones. "It does appear like the hyperscalers are being more discerning with leasing large clusters of power, and tightening up pre-lease windows for capacity that will be delivered before the end of 2026," the analysts wrote. The same day, TD Cowen analysts published similar findings from their own data center research. "Our most recent checks point to a pullback in US colocation deals from Amazon," they wrote in a note to investors. "We are aware of select colocation deals that it walked away from, as well as expansion options that it chose not to exercise," the Cowen analysts added. "This is a dynamic we will continue to monitor," the analysts wrote. These signs of moderation are pretty small in relation to this huge trend. However, trillions of dollars in current and planned investments are riding on the generative AI boom. With so much money on the line, any inkling that this rocket ship is not ascending at light speed is unnerving. These signals from Amazon echo similar moves by Microsoft, which recently halted some data center projects. "Like Microsoft, AWS seems to be digesting recent aggressive leasing activity," the Wells Fargo analysts wrote. They clarified that this doesn't mean signed deals are being canceled, but rather that AWS is pulling back from early-stage agreements like Letters of Intent or Statements of Qualifications—common ways that cloud providers work with partners to prepare for data center projects. In response to these growing concerns, Kevin Miller, the vice president of global data centers at AWS, posted on LinkedIn on Monday to offer some clarity. "We continue to see strong demand for both Generative AI and foundational workloads on AWS," he wrote. This is routine capacity management, and there haven't been any recent fundamental changes in our expansion plans." Miller's comments aim to position the pause not as a red flag, but as part of the normal ebb and flow of data center growth. Historically, these digestion periods, marked by slowing new leases or deferred builds, can last six to 12 months before a rebound, the Wells Fargo analysts wrote. Also, AWS typically doesn't do a lot of colocation deals anyway, preferring instead to build its own data centers, the analysts wrote. They also wrote that other tech giants, such as Meta and Google, are still aggressively pursuing new capacity. While AWS appears to be taking a breath, the AI cloud race is far from over. Analysts and investors will watch closely to see whether this pause marks a brief recalibration or a more significant shift in AI strategy.</p>
