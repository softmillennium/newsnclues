                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lanterns has been filming for a while at this stage, but we have word on yet another late addition to the cast of the DC Studios/HBO series. Deadline reports that veteran actor Paul Ben-Victor (Nobody Wants This) is set for a key recurring role as Antaan, "an extraterrestrial devoted to exposing the truth and exacting vengeance against those who wronged his people. Consumed by a deep and unrelenting hatred for the law, he is determined to deliver justice on his own terms." Antaan isn't an established DC Comics character, and based on the description above, there's speculation that Ben-Victor could actually be playing Atrocitus. There's always a chance this Antaan is an original character created for the show, but it would seem like an odd move when Atrocitus' backstory and motivations are so similar. I believed he would be Atrocitus but they're still referring to him as Antaan. Also I know they wanted to cast a tall actor but he's is 5'7. Not sure if it's Atrocitus in disguise or an OC https://t.co/7FkndNZbKi — Apocalyptic Horseman (@ApocHorseman) April 23, 2025 We recently got a first official look at Lanterns via a promo still featuring Kyle Chandler as Hal Jordan and Aaron Pierre as John Stewart, which you can check out below. #Lanterns, the new HBO Original Series from DC Studios, is now in production. Justin Britt-Gibson, Breannah Gibson and Vanessa Baden Kelly are also on board. Garrett Dillahunt is reportedly playing the villainous William Macon, who is described as "a self-righteous, conspiracy-minded man who masks his ruthless ambition behind a charming and calculated facade." There's some speculation that he will ultimately be unveiled as an established DC Comics baddie, possibly even Black Hand. Lanterns "follows new recruit John Stewart and Lantern legend Hal Jordan, two intergalactic cops drawn into a dark, earth-based mystery as they investigate a murder in the American heartland.". "We have a few other Lanterns peppered in there but this is really a terrestrial based TV show which is almost like True Detective with a couple of Green Lanterns who are space cops watching over Precinct Earth in it they discover a terrifying mystery that ties into our largest story of the DCU."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I don't think I will ever be signing up for something as fast as this: a famous (and possibly haunted) Duluth attraction is letting you onboard for a special experience. If you live in Duluth or visit often, chances are you've been onboard the William A. Irvin, located in the heart of Canal Park. The freighter always opens seasonally for tours, so you can truly get that Duluth experience when you visit town or have visitors in town. That will be the case once again for long weekends beginning on Friday, May 2nd. These tours are family friendly - but this isn't the only experience you can get aboard the ship! As of now, there will only be two dates in which you can take advantage of this special tour. The first tour will take place on Friday, June 13th from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. There will be another option on Tuesday, August 26th during the same time period. You can schedule your place on either tour by emailing organizers at hauntedship@decc.org. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, as paranormal investigators are not often allowed on the vessel for personal or individual tours. There have long been rumors that the William A. Irvin is actually haunted, and I am not just talking about the annual haunted ship attraction that pops up every Halloween. Staff on the ship have reported 'the sensation of being watched' and heard 'mysterious footsteps' on the ship when its been empty. Why don't you sign up and see for yourself?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Was a UFO successfully captured on camera in Mexico? There are few topics on the internet capable of generating more attention than debates and speculation about UFOs and unknown objects in the sky. Americans are obsessed with whatever is going on up there. Part of the issue is we have no clear answers, despite getting new videos and photos on a pretty regular basis. That leads us to a new story out of Mexico. *RELATED: Did Aliens Secretly Fight Soviet Soldiers? SIGN UP for The Daily OutKick. The popular UFO Instagram page @ufo5537 shared a bunch of pictures that allegedly show a UFO photographed near Chiapas. Give it a look below, and let me know your thoughts at David.Hookstead@outkick.com. I hate to pour cold water on all the hype, but if you asked me on a scale of zero to 100 how much faith I have in these photos, I'd put the number somewhere around .5. What are the odds an actual UFO happened to be flying over Mexico near someone with a camera, and it looks *EXACTLY* like UFOs from all the movies we enjoy? A snowball drenched in gasoline rolling through the gates of hell and surviving has better odds of happening. Photos going viral allegedly show a UFO in Mexico, but is it real? I'm willing to believe a lot and I have a very open-mind for the unexplainable. However, I also don't just buy whatever appears on the internet as real. People might be fascinated, but I'm not. For now, I refuse to give this my stamp of approval as real. You are agreeing to OutKick's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, but don't worry we don't spam.

A lengthy synopsis can be found on websites listing the book for pre-order. The story follows an architect from New York named Tate Donovan, who has lost his sister. "Tate gradually discovers that below the surface of Wren's idyllic small-town life, hatred, jealousy and greed are festering, threatening their fragile relationship just as it begins to blossom," reads the synopsis. "Tate realizes that in order to free Wren from an increasingly desperate fate, he will need to unearth the truth about her past before time runs out… a quest that will make him doubt whether we can ever believe the stories we tell about ourselves, and the laws that govern our existence.

Johnson, in an interview this week with a conservative influencer, said he wants to hold additional hearings on the attack on the World Trade Center complex in New York City, after watching a documentary and speaking to others who doubt the government's probe into the attack that killed nearly 3,000 people, including hundreds of first responders. “There are a host of questions that I will be asking, quite honestly, now that my eyes have been opened up,” Johnson said. “Respectfully, Senator Johnson should stop peddling conspiracy theories about the worst terrorist attack in our nation's history and one that forever altered the lives of so many of my fellow New Yorkers,” Lawler wrote on the social platform X, resharing an article about Johnson's remarks. Johnson, who is in his third Senate term, chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. He said in the interview early this week that “there's an awful lot of questions” surrounding 9/11 — particularly about the collapse of Building 7, which fell hours after hijackers crashed two commercial planes into the Twin Towers. An investigation by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) concluded that Building 7 progressively collapsed from a prolonged fire that couldn't be extinguished due to water supply issues after the building sustained extensive damage. “I am honoring them by responding to their concerns.

From starring in and co-creating the hit paranormal franchise Ghost Brothers, to becoming one of the most recognizable faces in supernatural television, Dalen Spratt has spent nearly a decade exploring the unknown.

As the first all-Black ghost-hunting team to break into mainstream media, Ghost Brothers redefined what it means to search for spirits — blending humor, heart, and history with real paranormal investigation.

Now, Dalen continues his journey into the beyond with The Graveyard Shift, a personal project and YouTube series where he dives even deeper, focusing on real-time spirit communication using a spirit box, often at historic cemeteries and haunted sites.

This week, he returns to the Tampa Theatre, which he first visited in 2022 with the Ghost Brothers, to investigate one of Tampa's most haunted historic sites for a future episode.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Scientists have developed the world's first operating system designed for quantum computers, which could let quantum computers connect with each other, thereby paving the way for a quantum internet. An operating system, such as Microsoft Windows or Apple iOS, is the program responsible for managing every other application on a computer. However, most quantum computers are designed and built for a specific function; for example, to run an experiment or simulation. This limits the potential functionality of quantum computers and hampers their connectivity. But on March 12, scientists published a new study in Nature describing QNodeOS, an operating system for quantum computers that works with all kinds of machines irrespective of the type of qubits they use. Such an operating system would enable multiple quantum computers to be connected together and controlled by the same central platform. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Related: Quantum computers are here — but why do we need them and what will they be used for? It translates the platform-independent quantum operations from QNodeOS into platform-dependent instructions and vice versa, thus enabling the QNodeOS to control different types of quantum computers. The scientists demonstrated the QNodeOS by connecting different quantum computers together (two made from processed diamonds with nitrogen vacancy centers and another made from electrically changed atoms) and running a test program, in a similar way to how a classical computer performs a calculation using cloud computing. —World's 1st modular quantum computer that can operate at room temperature goes online The study highlighted that the architecture could be improved by having the CNPU and QNPU on a single system board, to avoid millisecond delays in their communication, rather than relying on two separate boards. An operating system for quantum computers represents a major step forward in their development. One of the potential applications for a quantum computer operating system is for distributed quantum computing, as well as potentially laying the foundations for a quantum internet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Among the most exciting recent finds is Enaiposha, a planet that defies traditional classification. Unveiled in research that pushes the boundaries of our knowledge, Enaiposha is a super-Venus located approximately 47 light-years from the Sun. Enaiposha stands out due to its remarkable dimensions and atmospheric composition. However, what truly distinguishes this planet is its thick atmosphere, primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, water, methane, and carbon dioxide. The atmospheric conditions suggest a high concentration of water vapor and vaporized metals, drawing comparisons to Venus, hence its moniker “super-Venus.” The presence of carbon dioxide at levels akin to Venus adds to its intrigue, while the atmosphere's heavy metal content and reduced hydrogen levels pose intriguing questions about its formation. The upper layers, shrouded in haze and aerosols, complicate spectroscopic analysis, making it challenging to gather clear data. Yet, these conditions also offer a unique opportunity to study atmospheric phenomena that differ dramatically from those on Earth, expanding our understanding of planetary science. Airbus Unveils EPIIC's Mind-Blowing Cockpit Revolution: Prepare for the Most Advanced Pilot Interfaces Ever Seen in Aviation History Recent spectroscopic studies have unearthed molecular traces across various wavelengths, yet persistent haze poses a significant challenge by dimming the incoming light. The detection of carbon dioxide, although weak, required rigorous statistical analysis to confirm its presence. As Kazumasa Ohno from the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan points out, the initial CO2 signals were minimal, necessitating careful validation to ensure their authenticity. Beyond carbon dioxide, indications of complex metals and methane in Enaiposha's atmosphere hint at a rich chemical composition. These discoveries provide crucial insights into the intricate atmospheric dynamics of such dense exoplanets. “Robots are the new arms race”: Tesla and Boston Dynamics push Trump for a titanic plan to beat China's unstoppable AI army Advanced instruments and further measurements are essential to refine our knowledge of this fascinating planet. Understanding the evolution of thick atmospheres over time and exploring the potential transformation of sub-Neptunes under certain conditions remain key objectives for researchers. Investigating these phenomena could significantly enhance our understanding of atmospheric evolution on other worlds. Soviet Soldiers Turned to Stone by Bizarre UFO Attack: Declassified CIA Files Unveil Shocking Alien Encounter That Defies Explanation By challenging traditional categories like mini-Neptunes, Enaiposha compels scientists to rethink existing models and encourages deeper explorations into the universe's mysteries. As researchers continue to unravel Enaiposha's secrets, the potential for groundbreaking discoveries remains vast. With each new finding, we inch closer to a comprehensive knowledge of the universe's vast and varied worlds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even though Stephen King has been crowned 'The Master of Horror' (alongside John Carpenter) over the past 50 years of successfully petrifying his readers, the legendary author isn't averse to being scared himself. Although it's certainly hard to imagine, especially given that the terrifying books IT and Salem's Lot were conjured from his mind, it seems as though there are quite a few films that keep him up at night, and one of them is a supernatural terror that brave Stephen King devotees can stream for free. Not only does he capture the darkest parts of readers' imagination and bring them to life in a twisted puppet show, but the Maine native also offers a sense of escapism and nostalgia, while also blending terror with relatable human experiences. For those who enjoy King's movie and TV show recommendations, one starring George C. Scott, Trish Van Devere, and Melvyn Douglas should be on your watch list. Stephen King's novels and short stories are some of the scariest stories out there, and the beloved author is praising a movie fans will want to see. As reported by ComicBook, Stephen King previously revealed in an essay for the British Film Institute that The Changeling, a 1980 supernatural horror film directed by Peter Medak and starring George C. Scott, Trish Van Devere, and Melvyn Douglas, terrified the life out of him. King said that due to the simple yet creepy atmosphere of the movie, which didn't include any gory creatures or in-your-face scare factors, it was more than enough to keep him up at night. “For supernatural horror, I like Peter Medak's film The Changeling starring George C. Scott in perhaps his last great screen role,” King penned. “There are no monsters bursting from chests; just a child's ball bouncing down a flight of stairs was enough to scare the daylights out of me.” For those wondering what the plot of The Changeling includes that scared King so much, it follows the story of John Russell, his wife, and daughter, who all head off on vacation, but before they get to their destination, their car gets stuck in snow. While calling for roadside help at a phone box, John's wife and daughter are tragically killed by an oncoming truck that smashes into the car. However, it's not only movies that King has a soft spot for, as he loved From and Silo too, calling them both "worth his time."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Vatican's secret archives have long been a magnet for mystery - and now, alien intrigue. Sprawling across more than 50 miles of underground shelving, these heavily guarded documents have fueled wild speculation for centuries. As outlandish as it sounds, recent testimony by former US intelligence insiders claim the Vatican and American government have worked together to investigate, cover up and, most shockingly, study, UFOs. Following the death of Pope Francis at age 88 on Easter Monday, UFO investigator and filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee is calling on the next pontiff to come clean. Lee, who has spent three decades studying the links between religion, history and alien phenomena, claims the Vatican may be harboring 'hundreds' of classified files on UFO sightings - some possibly dating back centuries. 'If the Church is truly committed to spiritual truth and human enlightenment, then it must no longer suppress information that could fundamentally reshape our understanding of our place in the cosmos,' Lee said in a statement. 'If you read their original descriptions, what they wrote down, it's actually like orbs of light in the sky,' he told the Daily Mail. 'This was a non-human intelligence trying to communicate with us, and the Vatican knows it.' Recent testimony by former US spies appears to back him up. David Grusch, a decorated Air Force officer-turned-UFO whistleblower, claimed in a 2023 interview that the Catholic Church has been aware of alien life for decades. Grusch alleged that Pope Pius XII even 'backchanneled' details of the incident to American intelligence officials, who then swooped in and seized the craft. As for what may be driving the Vatican to withhold its alleged knowledge of extraterrestrials from the public, Lee suspects it may stem from the Church's concerns about inciting panic, or that it could shake people's faith. But he believes it's only a matter of time until the Vatican has no choice but to reveal what it knows. Thanks to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and other highly advanced research instruments, scientists have already found signatures of life beyond Earth. Most recently, astronomers used JWST to detect dimethyl sulfide molecules in the atmosphere of a planet known as K2-18b. On Earth, this chemical is almost exclusively produced by life forms like marine algae, leading the team to believe it could be a biosignature of alien life. Lee expects that researchers will soon find evidence of intelligent extraterrestrials, perhaps even within the next few months, he said. Such a revelation would put increased pressure on the Vatican to make any records of UFO encounters public, he suggests. What's more, releasing this information is important to national security and public safety, he adds, as it's possible some of these flying objects weren't alien at all, rather advanced military technologies wielded by global powers. 'What people are seeing in the sky, they could be genuine extraterrestrial UFOs, but there's also most likely going to be secret military technology years and years ahead of what we think they've got,' Lee said. 'I think people in the UFO community need to be aware of that. Pope Francis' successor will be elected by the College of Cardinals, who are all men that were appointed by the Pope and are usually ordained bishops. The election process, or 'conclave,' typically begins after a 15-day mourning period following the Pope's death, and can last for weeks or months. That's because the new Pope isn't elected until he has won at least 90 votes, which may take several rounds of voting. 'I think the public deserves to know,' he said. 'We don't need to be protected from this information.'</p>
