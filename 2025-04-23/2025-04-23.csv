            A major meeting in London aimed at bringing about an end to Russia's war in Ukraine has been downgraded after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he would skip the summit, escalating a clash between Washington and Kyiv over the future of Russian-occupied territory.
    


            Rubio had been expected to take part in the discussions with Ukrainian, UK and European officials, but State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Tuesday that he would no longer attend due to “logistical issues.”
    


            London's Foreign Office then confirmed on Wednesday that the meeting would take place at a lower level. “Official level talks will continue but these are closed to media,” the department said in a message to journalists.
    


            The developments throw new uncertainty over the diplomatic efforts to end Russia's war. The United States has become increasingly steadfast in its push to force Kyiv to an agreement, but Ukraine is adamant that it will not give up Crimea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014, or parts of eastern Ukraine that were captured following Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022.
    


            President Donald Trump slammed Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday for his comments that Ukraine wouldn't recognize Russian control of Crimea, calling the remarks “very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia.”
    


            “It's inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy's that makes it so difficult to settle this War. He has nothing to boast about! The situation for Ukraine is dire — He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country,” he posted on Truth Social.
    


            US Vice President JD Vance threatened to abandon negotiations on Wednesday, telling reporters during a visit to India: “We've issued a very explicit proposal to both the Russians and Ukrainians, and it's time for them to either say yes or for the US to walk away from this process. We've engaged in an extraordinary amount of diplomacy, of on the ground work.”

            But Ukraine's European allies, particularly Britain and France, have been hoping to bridge the divide. Wednesday's talks were due to follow a meeting in Paris last week in which officials from the US, the United Kingdom, France and Germany discussed the American framework for a ceasefire.
    


            After Rubio reversed plans to attend the latest talks, Bruce said President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, would represent the US in London instead.
    


            The US proposal that has caused deadlock includes recognizing Russia's control of Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula illegally annexed by Moscow, an official familiar with the framework told CNN. It would also put a ceasefire in place along the front lines of the war, the official said.
    


            Any move to recognize Russia's control of Crimea would reverse a decade of US policy.
    


            Zelensky made clear Tuesday that he was open to talks with Russia, but that Kyiv would not accept a deal that recognizes Moscow's control of Crimea.
    


            “Ukraine will not legally recognize the occupation of Crimea,” he told reporters. “There is nothing to talk about. It is against our constitution.”
    


            Asked to clarify about whether he meant the US wanted to freeze the territorial lines where they are, Vance said Wednesday, “No, I didn't say that. What I said is the current line, somewhere close to them is where you're ultimately, I think, going to draw the new lines in the conflict. Now of course, that means the Ukrainians and the Russians are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own. There's gonna have to be some territorial swaps.”
    


            Meanwhile, the war has resumed with full force this week, following a surprise ceasefire over the Easter weekend that both sides accused each other of breaching.
    


            On Wednesday, Ukrainian authorities said nine people were killed and at least 30 wounded when a Russian drone struck a bus carrying people to work near the city of Marhanets in the Dnipropetrovsk region.
    


            Russia's National Guard said it destroyed 17 Ukrainian attack drones overnight, state-run news agency Tass reported on Wednesday.
    


            The talks in London were scheduled as US officials publicly voiced frustration over the lack of progress at bringing an end to the war.
    


            Trump has said he would “have to see an enthusiasm to want to end it” from both sides for the US to continue negotiations, after Rubio warned last week that Washington could walk away from its efforts to end the conflict if there were no signs of progress.
    


            The broad framework has been presented to both sides, Rubio and the State Department have said, to determine whether the differences can be narrowed in a short timeframe. There are still pieces of the framework to be filled out and the US plans to work with the Europeans and the Ukrainians on that this week, the official told CNN.

The Kremlin's 30-hour truce was designed to shift blame to Ukraine. Did Trump buy it?



            Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff was expected to travel to Moscow this week to continue negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the White House said Tuesday. The Kremlin confirmed Witkoff's visit, but did not disclose further details, according to Russian state media.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday the negotiations were “hopefully moving in the right direction,” and declined to say what “stepping back” from the peace efforts might look like for the US.
    


            Moscow has previously stalled on ceasefire negotiations and rejected an earlier US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire agreed to by Kyiv.
    


            However, under pressure from Trump, Ukraine and Russia have expressed willingness to negotiate for the first time in years; the two sides have not held direct talks since the early weeks of Moscow's invasion in 2022.
    


            On Monday, Putin raised the prospect of holding direct talks with Ukraine about a ceasefire that would halt striking civilian targets, but said further discussion was needed on how to define a civilian target.
    


            Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later confirmed the Russian president's remarks, saying “(Putin) had in mind negotiations and discussions with the Ukrainian side,” Reuters reported, citing Russia's Interfax news agency.

            Although Pope Francis simplified the papal funeral rites in a move of typical modesty, Saturday's ceremony will still be full of pomp and pageantry, as the world's Catholics bid him farewell and cardinals in the Vatican ready themselves for the millennia-old process of picking a new pontiff.
    


            Here's what we know about the funeral of Pope Francis, who died of a heart attack and stroke on Easter Monday.
    


            Francis' body is lying in state in St. Peter's Basilica, where cardinals and members of the public will be able to pay their respects for three days. Thousands of mourners are packed into the piazza outside, waiting in line to visit the pope's coffin.
    


            The body was transferred to the basilica from the chapel of Casa Santa Marta, the Vatican guesthouse where Francis lived during his papacy.
    


            Francis' coffin has been laid at the Altar of the Confessio, a sacred space near the basilica's main altar, above the tomb of St. Peter, the first pope. In keeping with Francis' push to simplify the papal rites, his body is lying in an open wooden coffin, having done away with the tradition of having three coffins of cypress, lead and oak.
    


            Francis' funeral will begin at 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET) Saturday – six days after his death. The last papal funeral – for Pope Benedict XVI in 2023 – was also held six days after his death.
    


            At 8 p.m. Friday, Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the “camerlengo” tasked with making arrangements for the pope's funeral, will preside over the rite of the sealing of the coffin.
    


            The Vatican announced that Francis' funeral will be held mostly outside in St. Peter's Square. Rome has enjoyed glorious sunshine for much of the week, and more blue skies are forecast Saturday.
    


            Previous papal funerals have also been held outside, with thousands of the faithful filling the open space in front of the basilica.
    


            Francis' funeral liturgy will be presided over by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, dean of the College of Cardinals – the group that will in the coming weeks be tasked with appointing a new pope.
    


            Although the bulk of the service will be held outside, Francis' coffin will be brought back into the basilica after the eucharist, final commendation and valediction.

            The Vatican said the funeral will follow the rites laid out in the “Ordo Exsequiarum Romani Pontificis.” This liturgical book, detailing the procedures for papal funerals, was published in 2000 but revised by Francis last year.
    


            Some of those revisions have already been on display. Unlike after previous papal deaths, Francis' body was placed immediately inside his coffin, which has been left open to allow people to pay their respects.
    


            Diego Ravelli, master of apostolic ceremonies, said Francis had sought to “simplify and adapt” the rituals, so that the papal funeral is “that of a pastor and disciple of Christ, and not of a powerful person in this world.”
    


            Elise Allen, CNN's Vatican analyst, said Francis, the first Argentine pontiff, was the “pope of simplicity.”
    


            “He lived that way in Buenos Airies, and he tried to bring that into the papacy and the way that he lived as pope because that's something he wanted for the church itself – to be more simple, to be more in contact with reality, with the lives of people around,” Allen said.
    


            A string of political and religious leaders, royals and celebrities have confirmed they will be at the Vatican for Saturday's service.﻿



            At least 170 heads of state or government will be attending, the Rome mayor's office said Wednesday. Among them is Javier Milei, president of Francis' native Argentina who had previously clashed with the pontiff over economic policy. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, president of neighboring Brazil who had a close relationship with Francis, is also going.
    


            French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are among the major European leaders traveling to the Vatican.
    


            US President Donald Trump will also attend.
    


            Tens of thousands of others are expected to show up. About 50,000 people came to Benedict's funeral in 2023, while around 300,000 attended John Paul's in 2005.
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin has “no plans” to attend, the Kremlin said Tuesday.
    


            Because the International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued an arrest warrant for Putin, police in Italy – one of the 125 ICC member states – would be obliged to detain him.
    


            In his will, Francis gave simple instructions for his burial: “The tomb should be in the ground; simple, without particular ornamentation, bearing only the inscription: Franciscus.”
    


            Francis also said that throughout his life, he had always entrusted himself to the Virgin Mary. “For this reason, I ask that my mortal remains rest – awaiting the day of the Resurrection – in the Papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major,” he wrote.
    


            This basilica lies outside of the Vatican walls, on the other side of Rome's River Tiber. After the funeral in the Vatican, Francis' body will be transported there to be interred.
    


            The process of choosing a new pope, known as conclave, is a combination of ancient tradition, religious ritual and politics. The voting takes place behind closed doors. Only cardinals under the age of 80 – slightly over half the total number – have a say in the decision.
    


            Once the 135 members of the College of Cardinals are assembled in Rome, they meet in the Sistine Chapel to begin the decision-making process.
    


            Conclaves take as long as it takes for one of the cardinals to receive two-thirds of the vote. Over the centuries, it has taken hours, days, weeks and even years for a new pope to be chosen. Pope Francis was appointed in a little over a day.
    


            Of the 135 cardinals eligible to appoint the next pontiff, Pope Francis installed 108.
    


            That means four out of five votes in conclave will be cast by cardinals elevated by Francis. This has led some analysts to suspect they could appoint a successor who will follow Francis' pastoral priorities.

MOSCOW, April 23. /TASS/. Officials from the US, Europe, and Ukraine were unable to hold a meeting in London to discuss the Ukraine issue because they had failed to bring their positions closer together, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at a briefing.

""As far as we understand, they have been unable to align their positions on some issues, which is why the meeting did not take place,"" he noted.

Peskov also pointed out that the London meeting was supposed to give the US ""an opportunity to continue its mediation efforts.""

According to the Daily Telegraph, the US planned to present a seven-point settlement plan at the London meeting, which included Washington's recognition of Russia's sovereignty over Crimea. However, Vladimir Zelensky rejected the option on Tuesday, after which, according to the New York Times, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called off his trip to the UK.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

According to Matviyenko, the idea was doomed from the start. ""We will never support it because this concerns our country's security and sovereignty.

MOSCOW, April 23. /TASS/. African countries are tired of the arrogant behavior and double standards of the former West European colonial powers, Russia's Permanent Representative to the UN Vasily Nebenzya said at the plenary session of the 4th Forum ""Russia-Africa: What Next?"".

""We are convinced that the crisis situations that many African countries are currently going through are predominantly a consequence of long years of colonial dependence, consistent opposition to the manifestation of neo-colonial practices in Africa, where there is a real fatigue with the arrogant behavior and double standards of the former West European colonial powers,"" he said in a video message to the forum's participants.

Russia's ambassador to the UN added that Africans do not intend to put up with this state of affairs. Nebenzya recalled that Russia, in its turn, consistently opposes modern practices of neocolonialism.

""Trust in the collective West as a partner is declining everywhere, and there is a growing demand for fundamental changes in the modern system of international relations. Examples of successful cooperation on independent multilateral platforms, such as the Non-Aligned Movement, are multiplying,"" he emphasized.

Nebenzya also noted that the UN Security Council should adapt to the growing role of African countries in global world affairs and ""keep pace with these processes.""

American Lung Association's study says almost 156 million people live in areas with unhealthy levels of soot or smog

Almost half of Americans are breathing in dangerous levels of air pollutants, a new report shows, a rise compared with a year ago and likely to further increase in coming years thanks to the climate crisis and the Trump administration's sweeping environmental rollbacks.

Just over 156 million people live in neighborhoods with unhealthy levels of soot or smog – a 16% rise compared with last year and the highest number in a decade, according to the American Lung Association (ALA) annual state of the air report.

Soot and smog can cause premature death and increase the risk of an array of serious medical conditions such as asthma attacks, heart attacks and strokes, preterm births and impaired cognitive functioning in later life. Particle pollution also increases the risk of lung cancer.

Both pollutants are made worse by heat waves and wildfires – extreme weather events getting more intense and widespread due to human-made global heating.

Every year, the ALA grades exposure to unhealthy levels of ground-level smog (ozone pollution), and year-round and short-term spikes in soot (fine particle pollution/PM2.5) over a three-year period (2021 to 2023).

Its latest analysis found that almost 43m people live in areas with failing grades for all three measures. A person of color is more than twice as likely as a white American to live in a neighborhood with unhealthy levels of smog and soot. But Latino Americans are the most impacted, and three times more likely to be breathing in both toxic air pollutants.

PM2.5 or soot comes from wildfires, wood-burning stoves, coal-fired power plants and diesel engines among other industrial sources – and can be deadly. The new report includes data from summer 2023, when smoke from wildfires across Canada lit up the sky and engulfed midwestern and eastern states in soot.

Ozone or smog is a potent respiratory irritant likened to causing sunburn of the lungs. After years of progress on cleaning up ozone, some communities are seeing the worst smog in years.

The climate crisis-driven extreme heat and wildfires contributed to the increase in ozone levels for many parts of the country, most notably in central states from Minnesota to Texas. Warmer temperatures increase the risk of ozone forming and makes it harder to clean up.

“Families across the US are dealing with the health impacts of air pollution every day, and extreme heat and wildfires are making it worse. Air pollution is causing kids to have asthma attacks, making people who work outdoors sick, and leading to low birth weight in babies,” said Harold Wimmer, the president and CEO of the American Lung Association.

Only two cities, Bangor, Maine, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, were ranked as clean cities with no spikes in smog or soot, reflecting an overall worsening of air quality across the country, the report found.

“Efforts to slash staff, funding and programs at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are leaving families even more vulnerable to harmful air pollution,” Wimmer said.

The EPA was created in 1970 by the Nixon government amid increasing protests over unchecked industrial expansion by public health and environmental advocates, as well as communities bearing the brunt of air, water and land pollution.

The Trump administration has made dismantling climate and environmental regulations, policies and programs a top priority, and has already taken steps to gut the EPA by ordering mass layoffs and funding freezes. Environmental justice has come under particular attack, with Trump conflating efforts to address decades of environmental racism that led to poor air quality from heavy industry, landfills and highways being deliberately located in communities of color with diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies.

Even before Trump 2.0, almost 73 million people lived in counties where neither the ozone nor PM2 pollution levels are being monitored, according to the association, a public health data black hole likely to get worse as the funding cuts hit.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Irish language group uses Coachella gig to denounce Gaza attacks, saying ‘Palestinians have nowhere to go'

Sharon Osbourne has urged US authorities to revoke work visas for Kneecap after the Irish language rap group used a performance at Coachella to denounce Israeli attacks on Gaza.

The TV presenter accused the band of hate speech and supporting terrorist organisations and said it should not be allowed to perform in the US. “I urge you to join me in advocating for the revocation of Kneecap's work visa,” she exhorted followers on X on Tuesday.

Fox News commentators also condemned the band and accused it of bringing “Nazi Germany” sentiments to America.

Kneecap scorned the Fox News comments and posted supportive messages from fans, saying it had received thousands of such endorsements as well as “hundreds of violent Zionist threats”. Almost all the concerts of a US tour scheduled for October have sold out, it added.

The trio, Móglaí Bap and Mo Chara from Belfast and DJ Próvaí from Derry, have built a following in the US with a mix of Irish republican totems, punk spirit and a film that stormed last year's Utah film festival.

During their set last weekend at Coachella, the California desert music festival, Mo Chara said Britain had persecuted Irish people but not bombed them from the skies. “The Palestinians have nowhere to go.”

The performers led the audience in chants of “free, free Palestine” and screened pro-Palestinian messages on to screens. “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,” said one. “It is being enabled by the US government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes,” said another. The last used an expletive against Israel.

Osbourne, a judge on the TV show America's Got Talent, said the festival had “compromised its moral and spiritual integrity” by allowing Kneecap and Green Day to denounce Israel over the 18-month war.

“Music's primary purpose is to unite people. It should not be a venue for promoting terrorist organisations or spreading hate”, she said, singling out Kneecap's “aggressive” political statements.

“This band openly support terrorist organisations. This behaviour raises concerns about the appropriateness of their participation in such a festival and further shows they are booked to play in the USA.”

Fox News commentators compared the band's comments to Nazi Germany, with one saying the band should be removed from “authority positions” and that the “values of education” should be re-instilled.

Kneecap posted a clip of the segment and said the commentator's admission that she had not previously heard of the band was the “only part of this shite that made any sense”.

The group said they had planned to denounce “US-backed genocide in Gaza” at an earlier performance in Coachella, on 11 April, but that the comments did not appear on the screen. The band also complained that the festival's livestream did not carry a chant celebrating the death of Margaret Thatcher.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Taiwan does not have an official pavilion at the World Expo in Osaka, Japan, because of its diplomatic predicament, but the government-backed Tech World pavilion is drawing interest with its unique recreations of works by Taiwanese artists. 

The pavilion features an artificial intelligence (AI)-based art gallery showcasing works of famous Taiwanese artists from the Japanese colonial period using innovative technologies. 

Among its main simulated displays are Eastern gouache paintings by Chen Chin (陳進), Lin Yu-shan (林玉山) and Kuo Hsueh-hu (郭雪湖), who were the three young Taiwanese painters selected for the East Asian Painting exhibition in 1927.

Gouache is a water-based opaque paint that offers brighter and heavier pigment coverage than watercolors, and the “Eastern gouache” technique has been defined as paintings that use colors mixed with gelatin, clay or metal. 

One of the featured paintings, a 1968 work called Orchid (香蘭), was done by pioneering female artist Chen later in her life and portrays a woman in formal attire seated on a chair. 

Another of the works, Lin's 1930 classic masterpiece of Taiwanese Eastern gouache during the Japanese colonial period called Lotus Pond (蓮池), depicts a field of lotus flowers and an egret in the lower left.

Meanwhile, a display combining the 1930 work Festival on South Street (南街殷賑) by Kuo, which depicts a festive look at Taipei's Dihua Street during the colonial period, with the modern Taipei 101 skyline, is the favorite of the head of the pavilion's organizer. 

James Huang (黃志芳), honorary chairman of Tamayama Digital Tech Co, said Kuo's work, reinterpreted through technological innovation, is the one he most wanted to introduce to foreign visitors to the event. 

The gallery also features recreations of works of other famous Taiwanese artists, including Huang Tu-shui (黃土水), Chen Cheng-po (陳澄波), Lee Shih-chiao (李石樵) and Li Mei-shu (李梅樹). 

The government spent NT$2 billion (US$61.55 million) to build the Tech World pavilion, which is taking part in the World Expo as a private-sector pavilion. 

Beyond the AI-based art gallery, it showcases a slew of smart technologies and products developed by Taiwanese companies such as Asustek Computer Inc, AUO Corp and Hiwin Technologies Corp, said the Taiwan External Trade Development Council, which James Huang also heads. 

The pavilion has three multimedia theaters offering visitors an interactive and immersive experience through display technologies. 

Takashi Kubota, a Japanese visitor to the Tech World pavilion, said he visited Taiwan 30 years ago when he took the Alishan Forest Railway train in Chiayi County, but Tech World had shown him scenic spots in Taiwan he had not seen. 

He said the Taiwanese temple architecture images showcased in the AI Art Gallery were the most impressive displays he saw. 

The World Expo opened on April 13 and runs until Oct. 13.



                                                                                Several Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) officials including Chairman Eric Chu (朱立倫)  are to be summoned for questioning and then transferred to prosecutors for holding an illegal assembly in Taipei last night, the Taipei Police said today.

Chu and two others hosted an illegal assembly and are to be requested to explain their actions, the Taipei City Police Department's Zhongzheng (中正) First Precinct said, referring to a protest held after Huang Lu Chin-ju (黃呂錦茹), KMT Taipei's chapter director, and several other KMT staffers were questioned for alleged signature forgery in recall petitions against Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators.

An unprecedented coral bleaching episode has spread to 84 percent of the world's reefs in an unfolding human-caused crisis that could kill off swathes of the essential ecosystems, scientists warned yesterday.

Since it began in early 2023, the global coral bleaching event has mushroomed into the biggest and most intense on record, with reefs across the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic oceans affected.

Coral turns ghostly white under heat stress and the world's oceans have warmed over the past two years to historic highs, driven by the release of planet-warming greenhouse gases.

Reefs can rebound from the trauma, but scientists said that the window for recovery was getting shorter as ocean temperatures remained higher for longer.

Conditions in some regions were extreme enough to “lead to multispecies or near complete mortality on a coral reef,” the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.

The latest episode was so severe and lasting that even more resilient coral was succumbing, said Melanie McField, the director of Healthy Reefs for Healthy People, which specializes in the Caribbean.

“If you continue to have heat wave after heat wave, it's hard to see how that recovery is going to happen,” the veteran reef scientist said from Florida.

Bleaching occurs when coral expels algae that provide not just their characteristic color, but food and nutrients, leaving them exposed to disease and possibly eventually death.

Live coral cover has halved since the 1950s due to climate change and environmental damage, the International Coral Reef Initiative, a global conservation partnership, said in a statement yesterday.

Scientists forecast that at 1.5°C of warming, about 70 to 90 percent of the world's coral reefs could disappear — a disastrous prospect for people and the planet.

Coral reefs support not just marine life, but hundreds of millions of people living in coastal communities around the world by providing food, protection from storms, and livelihoods through fishing and tourism.

Mass coral bleaching was first observed in the early 1980s and is one of the best known and most visible consequences of steadily rising ocean temperatures caused by global warming.


SECURITY:

Tite takes break

Former Brazil coach Tite on Tuesday said he is pausing his professional career for an undetermined amount of time to deal with physical and mental health issues. The 63-year-old had been expected to sign a contract with Corinthians, but local media reported that he had an anxiety attack overnight before flying from Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, to Sao Paulo. “I have to understand that, as a human being, I can be vulnerable. Admitting to that will certainly make me stronger,” Tite said. “I love what I do and I will continue to, but as I spoke to my family and noticed the signs that my body was giving me I decided to do what is best now and interrupt my career to take care of myself as long as I need.”

South African player dies

South African player Sinamandla Zondi died on Tuesday after collapsing in the warmup before a second-tier match, his club Durban City said. He was 22. Zondi was taken to hospital ahead of Durban's game against Milford and the match was abandoned at halftime when officials were told that Zondi had died. The cause of death was still to be determined. “It is with deep sadness that we confirm the passing of Sinamandla Zondi, aka Sgora, a loved member of the Durban City family,” the club said in a statement. “Sinamandla was more than a talented footballer, He was a teammate, a friend, a brother, a son and an inspiration to all who knew him.”

CRICKET

Stackpole passes away

Former Australia Test vice-captain Keith Stackpole, one of Wisden's cricketers of the year in 1973, has died, Cricket Australia said yesterday. He was 84. Stackpole made his international debut in 1966 and played 43 Tests, scoring 2,807 runs and taking 15 wickets with his wrist spin. He also played in the very first one-day international, taking three wickets in Australia's five-wicket win over England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1971. He produced his best cricket in the Ashes, averaging 50.6 in 13 Tests, including his high score of 207 against England at the 'Gabba in 1970. Stackpole had a long career in the media and broadcasting after his international retirement in 1974. Cricket Australia chairman Mike Baird said Stackpole's “legacy will live long into the future.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Tuesday speech that the ongoing tariffs showdown against China is unsustainable and he expects a “de-escalation” in the trade war between the world's two largest economies.

But in a private speech in Washington for JPMorgan Chase, Bessent also cautioned that talks between the United States and China had yet to formally start. U.S. President Donald Trump placed import taxes of 145% on China, which has countered with 125% tariffs on U.S. goods. Trump has placed tariffs on several dozen countries, causing the stock market to stumble and interest rates to increase on U.S. debt as investors worry about slower economic growth and higher inflationary pressures.

Details of the speech were confirmed by two people familiar with the remarks who insisted on anonymity to discuss them.

“I do say China is going to be a slog in terms of the negotiations,” Bessent said according to a transcript obtained by The Associated Press. “Neither side thinks the status quo is sustainable.”

The S&P 500 stock index rose 2.5% after Bloomberg News initially reported Bessent's remarks.

Trump acknowledged the increase in the stock market in remarks to reporters afterward on Tuesday, but he avoided confirming if he, too, thought the situation with China was unsustainable as Bessent had said behind closed doors.

“We're doing fine with China,” Trump said.

Despite his high tariffs, Trump said he would be “very nice” to China and not play hardball with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

“We're going to live together very happily and ideally work together,” Trump said.

The U.S. president said that the final tariff rate with China would come down “substantially” from the current 145%.

“It won't be that high, not going to be that high,” Trump said.

The Trump administration has met for talks with counterparts from Japan, India, South Korea, the European Union, Canada and Mexico, among other nations. But Trump has shown no public indications that he plans to pullback his baseline 10% tariff, even as he has insisted he's looking for other nations to cut their own import taxes and remove any non-tariff barriers that the administration says have hindered exports from the U.S.

China on Monday warned other countries against making trade deals with the United States that could negatively impact China.

“China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests,” China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration has received 18 proposals from other countries for trade deals with the U.S., adding that “everyone involved wants to see a trade deal happen.”

The uncertainty over tariffs in the financial markets has also been amplified by Trump calling on the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate, with the president saying he could fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell if he wanted to do so.

Leavitt said Trump believes the Fed has by holding rates steady as it awaits the impacts of tariffs “in the name of politics, rather in the name of what's right for the American economy.”

Trump later said that he wanted Powell to “be early” in lowering rates and that he has no intention of firing the Fed chair, despite previously suggesting that he would.

Reports that the U.S. could formally give de jure recognition to Russia's control over Crimea have landed like a bombshell in Kyiv, with lawmakers unanimous in their opposition to such a move, as well as issuing grave warnings about its potential consequences.

""(The potential recognition of Crimea's annexation) sets a very dangerous precedent that could plunge the world into numerous wars,"" Volodymyr Ariev, a lawmaker with the European Solidarity Party, told the Kyiv Independent.

""Ukraine should not side with those intending to violate the fundamental principles established after World War II,"" he added. 

The Trump administration's final proposal for ending the Russia-Ukraine war included U.S. de jure recognition of Russia's control over Crimea, along with de facto recognition of its occupation of other Ukrainian territories, Axios reported on April 23, citing sources.

The news supports earlier reporting that the recognition of Russia's occupation of Crimea and a ban on Ukraine joining NATO are being considered as part of a U.S.-backed proposal to end the war.

Yelyzaveta Yasko, a lawmaker from the Servant of the People party, told the Kyiv Independent that she ""really fears"" the question of recognizing Crimea being raised during negotiations.

""I don't like it. I cannot imagine us agreeing to this if it's real de jure recognition, if I'm honest. If it was de facto then we could, but de jure is too much"" she said.

De facto recognition would mean accepting that where Russian troops are in control of Ukrainian territory, at least for the foreseeable future, they remain so.

But it would leave open the option of the land returning to Ukraine, potentially by diplomatic means, something President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously acknowledged could be the only way to regain control of Crimea.

De jure recognition, however, would be final — an admission that the land in question is under Russian control and will remain so indefinitely. The only means of reversing it would be by force.

Russia occupied Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in February 2014. In March 2014, the Russian-controlled Crimean parliament voted to hold a ""referendum"" to join Russia.

The sham voting on annexation was conducted in the absence of any international observers and with armed Russian soldiers present at polling locations.

Ukrainian lawmakers who spoke to the Kyiv Independent said recognizing Russia's de jure control of the peninsula is next to impossible.

""The Ukrainian Constitution does not provide for the recognition of its territories as being seized by another (country),"" Ariev said. 

According to the Ukrainian Constitution, Crimea is a legally recognized and inseparable part of Ukraine.

No acts can be passed by the Ukrainian government that contradict the country's Constitution.

The only way Ukraine could legally recognize Crimea as Russian would be to hold a referendum on the issue and put the vote to the people. While recent polling shows the number of Ukrainians willing to make territorial concessions to end the war has risen, a majority still oppose the idea.

Further, polling has not specified between de facto and de jure control, with de jure likely to be more heavily opposed than de facto.

""No Ukrainian government has a mandate to recognize Crimea as Russian,"" Halyna Yanchenko, a lawmaker from the Servant of the People party, told the Kyiv Independent.

""Any peace agreement that includes such a provision would risk sparking unrest within the country. That's why no Ukrainian leadership would ever agree to it. 

""And there is simply no chance such a deal would pass a vote in Ukraine's Parliament.""

Ukraine finds itself in what Zelensky on April 22 described as ""a very dangerous moment,"" with the U.S. threatening to back out of the peace effort if Kyiv doesn't agree to its proposal.

Talking to journalists during a visit to India, U.S. Vice President JD Vance said that it is time for Kyiv and Moscow ""to either say yes or for the United States to walk away from this process.""

All of this risks playing into the hands of the Kremlin, with both Moscow and Washington potentially being able to point to Ukraine's refusal as the main sticking point of negotiations.

""Ukraine will never agree,"" Oleksandr Merezhko, lawmaker and chair of the parliament's foreign affairs committee, told the Kyiv Independent.

""It will be considered as a provocation with a view (for the U.S.) to exit negotiations and to put the blame on the victim of the aggression.""

Ariev said that if the U.S. follows through with the move, it could ""open Pandora's box globally.""

""Recognizing territory seized by military means — this would be the first such recognition since World War II — sets a dangerous precedent that could reignite wars in the future, which could potentially reach the scale of World War III,"" he said.

""This is extremely dangerous and cruel.""","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

As a U.S.-proposed deal for Ukraine's natural resources stalled amid months of tense negotiations, some in Ukraine who were initially optimistic about the agreement are starting to lose hope.

At least that's how one graphite mine in Ukraine's central Kirovohrad Oblast feels about it, business reporter Dominic Culverwell reports in his latest.

The Zavalivskiy mine, located in the village of Zavallia, holds some 7.5 million metric tons of graphite ore in the second largest flake graphite mine in Europe.

But the war has taken a big toll on the mine. Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, the company has lost nearly a third of its workforce. Production has plummeted from 15,000 metric tons annually to 850 metric tons last year and it's lost around half of its customers around the world.

Which is why, when the minerals deal came about, the company's CEO was pretty excited.

“I think that it would be really positive if the U.S. came to the Ukrainian mining market. They should spend money and time to build something, to mine something,” CEO Ostap Kostyuk told the Kyiv Independent in February, emphasizing the critical need for investments in the underfunded sector.

In Zavalivskiy Graphite's case, innovation brought in through investors could involve high-tech equipment to purify graphite to a level suitable for use in batteries, called spherical graphite (SPG), which sells for $3,500- $10,000 per metric ton.

Machinery for SPG purification costs $30-40 million, which the currently unprofitable company can't afford. Kostyuk was optimistic the Americans could bring in this technology and cooperate with Zavalivskiy to produce the highly purified graphite and break into a market dominated by China.

But as events unfolded, drafts of the deal were leaked to the public, and it became apparent the U.S. was proposing to gain unprecedented control over Ukraine's sovereign natural resources as “repayment” for its military aid to Ukraine, Kostyuk lost the faith.

Even if the deal is signed this week, which is supposed to happen, the fears that it could be a win-lose for Ukraine have already settled in.

The minerals deal saga has left Kostyuk feeling that Ukraine is on the verge of being “scammed” and will end up on its own, indebted to its allies, Culverwell writes.

“We should recover ourselves. If this help is a debt, my kids and grandkids will pay this debt. So what can we do? We can't do anything,” Kostyuk said in April.

Following a series of rate hikes since the beginning of the year, Ukraine's Central Bank held the interest rate at 15.5% as it expects inflation to begin cooling.

The bank also said, however, that “due to the high level of uncertainty, which has only increased over past months, the National Bank of Ukraine will respond flexibly to changes in the balance of risks to the price dynamics and inflation expectations.”

Price growth is expected to start slowing this summer after it hit its highest level since May 2023 in March, reaching 14.6%. The bank expects inflation to drop to 8.7% at the end of 2025 and reach a target of 5% in 2026.

Ukraine's economic resilience may outlast Russia's oil-funded war machine, says a new report by the London School of Economics' foreign policy think tank LSE IDEAS.

The report looks closely at how both Russia and Ukraine have adapted their economies to the demands of war. Despite the difficulties brought on by a full-scale invasion, the report finds that Ukraine — buoyed by external financing secured through 2027 and improved tax mobilization — is in a surprisingly strong negotiating position.

In contrast, Russia's continued dependence on oil revenues makes it highly vulnerable to price volatility in global oil markets. The country is also facing a looming credit crunch and a potential systemic banking crisis, the report says.

While neither side is set up for “total victory,” Russia's internal vulnerabilities may change its negotiating calculus in the year ahead, says Dr. Luke Cooper, author of the report and associate professorial research fellow in international relations.

“Even in the face of the (President Donald) Trump administration's apparent pivot towards the Russian side, Ukraine and its European allies hold more ‘cards' than many, including President Trump, seem to believe,” says Cooper.

The spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank are happening this week in Washington, D.C., with President Donald Trump's tariff spree expected to dominate talks.

But as Trump and his team take an axe to institutions — and the world order as we know it — people attending the talks are wondering what implications the Trump administration's inward turn away from its global alliances will mean for institutions like the IMF and World Bank.

According to Jimena Zuniga of Bloomberg Economics, a weakened IMF and World Bank would put at risk the emerging markets around the world that rely on the IMF to respond to fiscal challenges such as high debt or shrinking reserves — a list of markets which includes Ukraine.

The IMF came to Ukraine's aid at the start of the full-scale invasion, lending to a country at war for the first time in its nearly 80-year history. In March 2023, the IMF and Ukraine agreed on a loan program to provide Kyiv with $15.6 billion in financing for budget support over four years.

The Trump administration's final proposal for ending the Russia-Ukraine war included U.S. de jure recognition of Russia's control over Crimea, along with de facto recognition of its occupation of other Ukrainian territories, Axios reported on April 23, citing sources.

The news supports earlier reporting that the recognition of Russia's occupation of Crimea and a ban on Ukraine joining NATO are being considered as part of a U.S.-backed proposal to end the war.

The U.S. reportedly presented its peace proposal last week during a meeting with Ukrainian officials in Paris. At the same time, Washington signaled that it would withdraw from the talks if the parties did not agree to conclude a peace agreement soon.

The U.S. peace plan will require significant concessions from Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky, Axios reported. In turn, the pitch outlines several ""tangible gains"" for Russia, the outlet's source said.

According to U.S. President Donald Trump's final peace proposal, Washington would de jure recognize the Russian control over Crimea and de facto recognize the occupation of Ukrainian territories in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.

The deal would also prevent Ukraine from joining NATO but permit EU membership, lift sanctions imposed on Russia since 2014, and include deeper energy and economic cooperation between the U.S. and Russia.

In return, the U.S. promises Ukraine ""a robust security guarantee"" backed by European countries and possibly non-European like-minded countries. 

Trump's proposal does not clearly outline how this peacekeeping mission would work or provide security guarantees. The document also does not mention the U.S. role in this mission.

According to the U.S. peace plan, Ukraine will get back a part of Kharkiv Oblast occupied by Russia, gain unimpeded passage of the Dnipro River, which flows along the front line in some parts of southern Ukraine, and receive compensation for the reconstruction of the country. The document does not specify how this will be financed.

The document also mentions the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is to be recognized as controlled by Ukraine but operated by the U.S. As the proposal reads, the electricity produced by the plant will be supplied to both Ukraine and Russia.

The U.S. expected Ukraine to respond to its peace plan in London on April 23, according to Axios.

Zelensky has already ruled out recognizing Crimea as Russian territory, after which U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff moved to skip the London meeting. European foreign ministers are also reportedly suspending their participation.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Containers at the Yantian port in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, on April 17.Tingshu Wang/Reuters

Beijing has welcomed signs the U.S. is second-guessing its aggressive approach to China, following weeks of escalating reciprocal tariffs and bilateral tensions.

Markets were buoyed Tuesday on remarks U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made to a private investment conference in Washington, in which he predicted a U.S.-China trade deal in the “very near future,” saying “neither side thinks the status quo is sustainable.”

Asked about Mr. Bessent's comments later in the day, President Donald Trump said the current 145 per cent tariff on all Chinese goods will “come down substantially,” the latest dramatic U-turn in his global trade war.

At a regular news conference Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun reiterated Beijing's long-standing point that “there are no winners in a tariff war or a trade war.”

“China's attitude is very clear,” Mr. Guo said. “We do not want to fight, but nor are we afraid to. If forced to fight, we will do so to the end. When it comes to talks, our door is wide open.”

In his remarks to investors, Mr. Bessent predicted negotiations with Beijing “will be a slog,” but said that, nevertheless, “over the very near future, there will be a de-escalation, and I think that should give the world, the markets, a sigh of relief.”

Indeed it did, with the S&P 500 stock index rising 2.5 per cent and Asian markets trading upwards on Wednesday on reports of Mr. Bessent's speech.

The President was also more optimistic than his Treasury Secretary, saying he believed a trade deal could happen “pretty quickly,” adding he would not “play hardball” during negotiations.

“They're gonna do very well, and I think they're going to be happy, and we're gonna live together very happily and ideally work together,” he said.

During Mr. Trump's first term, the U.S. and China spent months negotiating a phase one trade deal, which was never fully implemented, with Washington instead slapping tariffs on many Chinese goods, sparking a trade war.

That dispute was nothing compared to the escalation seen since January, however, with both sides ratcheting up reciprocal tariffs to the point where a full economic decoupling seemed inevitable.

Throughout, Mr. Trump had encouraged China to come to the table, even suggesting Chinese leader Xi Jinping was keen to make a deal, but Beijing showed no signs of blinking, publicly dismissing the threat of U.S. tariffs and seeking to build ties with partners in Europe and Southeast Asia. This approach was bolstered by Mr. Trump's “Liberation Day” tariffs on almost every country in the world, which alienated U.S. trading partners, helping China advance itself as the more responsible global player.

When Washington paused most tariffs, some Trump administration officials tried to paint the move as a deliberate tactic to isolate China, and Beijing did show some concern that countries would agree to tariff Chinese goods in return for relief from U.S. measures, warning Monday that “China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests.”

The costs of Mr. Trump's global trade war have been piling up in recent weeks, with stocks and U.S. treasuries trading lower and lower, sparking growing criticism, with even some supporters of the President publicly doubting his strategy.

On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund forecast economic growth will slow to 2.8 per cent this year globally, compared to 3.3 per cent in 2024.

Last week, a group of leading economists published an open letter warning Mr. Trump's tariffs “have injected uncertainty and chaos into the global economy through wildly fluctuating rates and ever-changing orders,” and represented the “largest tax increase on trade in almost a century.”

That letter – which now has more than 1,500 signatories – was widely reported on in China, where state media has often focused on the cost of Mr. Trump's measures to U.S. business and consumers, while dismissing any potential risk to the Chinese economy.

Speaking to the state-run Global Times on Wednesday, Bao Jianyun, a professor of international studies at Renmin University in Beijing, said Washington's “seemingly softening tone underscores that the U.S. tariff policy has shown a significant discrepancy between its actual outcomes and its initial goals.”

Prof. Bao added that Mr. Trump's frequent flip-flopping on tariffs had reduced his credibility, but said “the U.S. goal of containing and suppressing China will not change.”

Beijing has struggled to establish a reliable back channel with the Trump administration as it had Joe Biden's, during whose term tensions were often high but talks continued on multiple issues, including topics important to Mr. Trump, such as cracking down on fentanyl.

Mr. Trump's team reportedly rebuffed an initial reach out by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, regarding him as not influential enough with Mr. Xi. Beijing has also been offended by public comments from Trump administration officials, including Vice-President JD Vance describing Chinese workers as “peasants.”

Speaking Wednesday, Mr. Guo, the Foreign Ministry official, said any dialogue must be “on an equal footing, with respect and on a mutually beneficial basis.”

“Saying that it wants to reach an agreement with China while constantly imposing maximum pressure is not the correct way to deal with China and will not work.”

Big changes in tax returns from year to year can attract auditors' attention.Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press

Being selected for an audit by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) doesn't necessarily result in penalties or more taxes owed. But audits take time, and it's safe to assume most taxpayers and business owners can come up with any number of activities they'd prefer to being audited.

While the CRA doesn't publish detailed audit statistics, the good news is the chance of being audited is relatively small for employees who haven't bought or sold property or claimed losses, says Anna Malazhavaya, founder and tax lawyer at Advotax Law Professional Corp. in Toronto. 

The probabilities she's heard discussed at Canadian Tax Foundation conferences rise to about 2 per cent for small businesses and 7 per cent for medium-sized companies.

“The best advice I can give to an individual or a business owner who wants to avoid being audited is to hire a very good accountant and share all the information with that professional. Just tell the truth,” Ms. Malazhavaya says. 

That said, there are red flags individual taxpayers and business owners should avoid when possible:

Be careful with real estate transactions: The CRA's real estate tax force was established in 2019 to focus on tax non-compliance in the Greater Toronto and Greater Vancouver real estate markets. 

“Auditors analyze real estate transaction data, and they normally select people who sold a real estate property relatively soon after they purchased it or after construction work was done on the property and a permit was obtained from the city,” Ms. Malazhavaya says. 

Watch for shifts from previous years' tax returns: Inconsistencies in individual (or business) tax returns from one year to another may attract attention. Watch for new sources of income and large sales or purchases, says Natalie Worsfold, partner, tax litigation, with Counter Tax Litigators LLP in Toronto. 

In addition, CRA systems often flag first-time declarations of offshore assets for a pre-assessment review that may precede an audit. 

“If you respond to [that] with enough information, you can usually escape a full audit,” she says. 

Don't stray too far from the average: If the average income in the taxpayer's neighbourhood is much higher than the taxpayer's reported income, the discrepancy may be flagged, says Sabrina Fitzgerald, national tax leader with PwC Canada in Ottawa. 

Echoing Ms. Worsfold, she adds that shifts from year-over-year averages may trigger an audit as well. For example, a sudden change in reported investment income, medical expenses or spousal support payments. 

Avoid big changes in businesses: Ms. Fitzgerald says frequent changes in the structure of a business may raise suspicion. So can a significant increase in expenses or expenses that are either disproportionate to reported revenue or unusual for the industry. Making significant changes when amending a corporate tax return may also prompt an audit. 

Keep business claims reasonable: Claims for large refundable credits may cause the CRA to take a closer look. 

“The CRA may scrutinize these claims to ensure they're legitimate and accurately reported,” Ms. Fitzgerald says. 

Also, a long run of rental or business losses may raise questions about whether these ventures have a reasonable expectation of earning income or are merely a hobby.

Classify expenses appropriately: As anything outside the pattern of a business's normal reporting could raise the CRA's eyebrows, make sure there's consistency in how business expenses are classified, Ms. Worsfold says. 

It's essential, for example, to ensure bookkeepers and accountants are on the same page when deciding how to categorize a contractor's fees. 

“Strengthen your documents,” she says. “Keep an eye on what's in your journal entries [and] in your year-end adjusting entries, [which are] one of the first places CRA looks.” 

Make sure all reporting matches: Mismatches in reporting for a business and related corporations can trigger an audit. In addition, corporate tax returns should be consistent with GST/HST reporting and T slips. 

“The pattern recognition that the CRA is doing is essentially looking at all the information they have about you and people you do business with, and then looking to see where the inconsistencies are,” Ms. Worsfold says.

Increasingly, CRA audits are risk-based challenges to something that appeared on a taxpayer's return, rather than geared toward education, Ms. Worsfold adds. That means back-and-forth communication can escalate quickly from friendly to “a conflict unfolding in front of your eyes.” 

She recommends businesses, in particular, stay in touch with their accountant throughout the year and, if selected for an audit, remain involved in the process even if the accountant takes the lead. 

“The audit volume and intensity are increasing so much, you want to make sure that everybody's aware of what's happening, what's being passed to the CRA and where you are in that conflict escalation framework,” Ms. Worsfold says.

Evidence filed by Trans Mountain with the Canadian Energy Regulator shows that the proposed tolls to ship oil to China are $9.19 per barrel higher than shipping on an Enbridge pipeline to the U.S. Gulf.JASON FRANSON/The Canadian Press

Thomas Gunton is professor and founding director of the Resource and Environmental Planning Program at Simon Fraser University and recently completed a report for the International Institute for Sustainable Development on the Trans Mountain Pipeline.

The upending of international trade by the Trump administration has posed an existential crisis for Canada.

But while there is a consensus that we need new strategies to confront the threat, we need to be careful that we do not simply make things worse by ill-advised initiatives cobbled together in the heat of the crisis.

Nowhere is this truer than in the energy sector, where one of the proposed solutions is to streamline the review process and build more pipelines to allow our energy exports to be shipped to other markets.

While such a strategy has intuitive appeal, it would end up being a costly blunder that would do more harm than good to the Canadian economy.

The problem is that the world demand for oil will peak by 2030 and then begin to decline. No one knows for sure what the rate of decline will be, but both the International Energy Agency and private oil companies such as BP forecast a small to significant decline as high as 75 per cent by 2050, depending on future climate policies.

In this environment, investing in a major expansion of oil production in Canada, which is among the highest-cost producers in the world, is highly risky, especially given the unused low-cost oil production capacity in the Middle East.

And even if Canadian production increases, the Canadian Energy Regulator concludes that there is sufficient pipeline capacity in place – with minor low-cost expansions of existing pipelines – to meet even their most optimistic demand forecast.

In this environment, building new pipelines to diversify our export markets would simply duplicate existing pipelines we have already built that ship oil to the United States.

But building new pipelines to divert oil shipments from the U.S. would not be worth the benefits for several reasons.

First, even under the most expedited approval process it would still take at least four to five years to build a pipeline, thus providing no benefit in the foreseeable future or for the duration of the Trump presidency.

Second, the costs of duplicating existing pipelines would be enormous. The expanded Trans Mountain pipeline, for example, cost just over $34-billion to add 590,000 barrels per day of new capacity. At this rate, diverting all four mb/d exports shipped to the U.S. would cost $235-billion and building this new capacity, let alone financing it, would be prohibitive.

And even if we were able to add major new capacity at a slower rate, the incremental shipment costs would be higher than any likely long-term tariffs on Canadian oil exports.

Evidence filed by Trans Mountain with the Canadian Energy Regulator shows that the proposed tolls to ship oil to China are $9.19 per barrel higher than shipping on an Enbridge pipeline to the U.S. Gulf, even at the taxpayer-subsidized tolls that cover less than half the cost to build the pipeline.

If the full costs are covered in the tolls, which they would be in any new pipeline, the cost of shipping to China could be between about $13 to $22 per barrel higher than the U.S. Gulf, (depending on the method used to determine tolls).

At the average 2024 Western Canadian Select price of around $87 per barrel, producers would have to receive between 15 per cent and 25 per cent less per barrel shipped to the U.S. for the entire 40-year operating life of the pipeline before they would consider building one.

And that is based on the unlikely assumption that the existing pipelines would not lower tolls to retain shippers.

This is why no private company has proposed building a new pipeline and will not consider the option without a massive taxpayer subsidy, even if the review process is streamlined.

Canada exports about 80 per cent of its five mb/d oil production to the U.S., and the ability to shift these exports to other destinations is limited and not cost-effective.

It may have made sense to diversify export markets when the original pipeline infrastructure was being planned, or if there are any future expansions, but the die has been cast for oil. The infrastructure was built to serve the U.S. market given its proximity, and the age of expansion for oil and new major pipelines is over.

Canada needs to diversify its exports and strengthen its economy by, for example, removing internal trade barriers, investing in energy conservation and expanding interprovincial electricity infrastructure to meet the growing demand for clean energy. Clearly, we would be better off using our scarce capital on these and other needed investments with a higher return and negotiating the removal of tariffs instead of building duplicate pipeline capacity that will make us worse off.

The US president has ordered a review of US-funded international organizations, which he claims unfairly benefit other nations. As the IMF and World Bank hold their Spring summits this week, are their futures secure?

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank rarely capture headlines outside periods of significant upheaval. A Google search for debt-laden Argentina, for instance, is as likely to bring up articles about IMF loans as it is to celebrate Lionel Messi's latest football triumph.

The IMF's latest $20 billion (€17.4 billion) debt relief for Argentina, its largest debtor nation, was announced last week to help libertarian President Javier Milei continue reforming the South American country's economy after decades of wasteful spending.

However, the World Bank's work tends to fly under the radar. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it quietly delivered $170 billion in loans and grants to over 100 countries, according to its website, reaching some 70% of the world's population.

As the IMF and World Bank convene for their Spring Meetings in Washington, DC, from Thursday, they face significant uncertainty. First, US President Donald Trump's tariff policy is threatening to derail global economic growth. Second, the future of the United States backing of these organizations is up for question.

Speculation has been rife since Project 2025, a hard-right Republican policy framework tied to Trump's second term, proposed a US withdrawal from both institutions, labeling them ""expensive middlemen"" that redirect US funds globally.

Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and the World Health Organization, coupled with an order in February to review all US-funded international organizations within 180 days, has further fueled concerns about the US's future involvement in the IMF and World Bank. The White House has yet to name executive directors to both bodies, signaling a deliberate pause in engagement.

The US has, however, reaped substantial benefits from these institutions, both economically and through soft power projection. With the largest voting share in both the IMF and World Bank, the US has effective veto power over major decisions. Loans to indebted nations often come with conditions like market liberalization that align with US interests.

Robert Wade, a professor of political economy at the London School of Economics (LSE), thinks a US withdrawal would have serious implications for its global standing.

""Successive US administrations and Congress have long operated as if the World Bank and IMF were agents or arms of the US state,"" Wade told DW. ""In one way or another, Washington exercises a great deal of influence over their policies.""

Trump's century-high tariffs, announced earlier this month, created significant uncertainty in the global economy, with stock markets selling off sharply. Critics now fear an inward-looking Trump administration could unravel the entire post-Bretton Woods global financial system, which supports trade and stability through floating exchange rates, the US dollar's dominance and institutions like the IMF and World Bank.

""The Trump administration does not have a coherent position about reforms to the World Bank, IMF, or any other international institution,"" Constantin Gurdgiev, an associate professor of finance at the University of Northern Colorado, told DW. ""This is a transactional populist, inwardly focused agenda of scoring quick wins at the expense of the international system."" 

Any US withdrawal may create an immediate liquidity crisis for the IMF and World Bank, whose combined $1.5 trillion in resources depend heavily on US contributions. Gurdgiev forecast a ""significant impact"" on their ability to fund effective responses to future crises and said a US pullout would be a strategic gift to China, which has already invested heavily to expand its global influence.

""Both institutions are extremely cost-effective for the US and help it to deliver on its longer-term agenda of pairing the risks from countries like China,"" Gurdgiev said.

A tally by Boston University's Global Development Policy Center estimates that China made nearly $500 billion in loan commitments to 100 countries between 2008 and 2021. With a weakened IMF or World Bank, countries in debt distress or seeking infrastructure funding may increasingly turn to China's institutions, amplifying Beijing's geopolitical leverage.

In 2015, China and other BRICS nations of the Global South launched the New Development Bank (NDB), often seen as a rival to the World Bank. The NDB offers loans with fewer conditions and promotes lending in non-dollar currencies, challenging Western financial dominance.

A US exit would also prompt the relocation of the IMF and World Bank's headquarters from Washington, DC, potentially to Japan, the second-largest backer. Wade notes that China, underrepresented in voting shares (6.1% in the IMF), would fiercely oppose this.

""Trump could argue, 'Increase your funding, and you'll gain a larger vote share,'"" Wade said of the US president's possible negotiation tactic. ""It's more likely that the US would make at least a serious threat to leave the World Bank [rather than the IMF].""

While regional banks like the Asian Development Bank or the Inter-American Development Bank could partially fill the World Bank's role, alternatives to the IMF are scarce. BRICS efforts to create an IMF counterpart have stalled.

Gurdgiev argues that Trump is looking to the IMF and World Bank to be ""cheerleaders"" for his high-tariff, America First policy agenda and sees Washington making moves to curb China and other BRICS nations' influence in both organizations.

""But those institutions have enough intellectual integrity to understand how dangerous these policies are to both the US and global economy,"" he added.

Indeed, there are growing concerns that Trump's aggressive trade policies, if fully enacted and retaliated against, have the potential to trigger a major global financial crisis. The IMF is due to lower its growth forecast for dozens of countries on Tuesday as the choking of global trade puts pressure on the debt burdens of many nations.

""The global financial situation now is very fragile and could easily tip into a financial crisis,"" warned Wade, the political economy professor. He predicted that Trump would be forced to ""pull back"" from any talk about leaving the IMF and World Bank ""if clear signs of a debt crisis emerge.""

Gurdgiev, meanwhile, warns that a lack of engagement by Washington in both institutions only adds to the current pessimism about Trump's economic policies and the US's future role in global affairs. This precariousness, he believes, could create a systemic crisis at a time when both the IMF and World Bank are severely weakened. 

""We are neutering the ability of institutions that act as a lender of last resort to do their jobs,"" Gurdgiev, who is also a visiting professor at Trinity College Dublin, warned. ""It's a complete and utter nonsense.""

Harmful bleaching is now affecting 84% of the world's coral reefs, the highest rate in recorded history, scientists say. The phenomenon comes as oceans increasingly warm as a result of human-induced climate change.

The world's coral reefs are going through the most intense bleaching event ever recorded, with 84% of them now affected, scientific authorities announced on Wednesday.

The current crisis, the fourth global bleaching event since 1998, is more intense than the 2014-17 episode that caused some two-thirds of global reefs to experience the harmful whitening.

Coral bleaching occurs when the colorful algae that live within corals and feed them begin to produce toxins as a result of warming waters, causing their hosts to expel them. This exposes the corals to a greatly increased risk of disease and starvation.

The widespread bleaching event that has now been hitting the world's reefs since 2023 has been blamed on the rising temperature of oceans amid global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities.

""We're looking at something that's completely changing the face of our planet and the ability of our oceans to sustain lives and livelihoods,"" said Mark Eakin, executive secretary for the International Coral Reef Society and retired coral monitoring chief for the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

""The best way to protect coral reefs is to address the root cause of climate change. And that means reducing the human emissions that are mostly from burning of fossil fuels. Everything else is looking more like a Band-Aid rather than a solution,"" Eakin said.

""The magnitude and extent of the heat stress is shocking,"" said Melanie McField, a marine scientist working in the Caribbean for the Healthy Reefs for Healthy People initiative. ""Some reefs that had thus far escaped major heat stress and we thought to be somewhat resilient succumbed to partial mortalities in 2024.""

""Bleaching is always eerie — as if a silent snowfall has descended on the reef,"" she added.

""I think people really need to recognize what they're doing — inaction is the kiss of death for coral reefs.""

The Earth had its hottest year on record last year, and the average annual sea surface temperature of oceans away from the poles hit a record 20.87 degrees centigrade (69.57 Fahrenheit).

Scientists forecast that at 1.5 C of warming above pre-industrial levels, which the Earth reached last year, some 70% to 90% of the world's coral reefs could disappear, which would have an enormous impact on human livelihoods and biodiversity.

 At 2 C, almost all corals would vanish, scientists say.

If current climate policies by world governments are enacted, the world could warm by 3.1 C by 2100.

Over 300 Canadian electoral candidates have endorsed a 5-point “Vote Palestine” platform thanks to activist pressure.

Montreal, Canada — The United States has loomed large over Canada's upcoming election, with concerns over President Donald Trump's tariffs and annexation threats dominating much of the campaign.

But for many Canadians, another topic has also been front-of-mind in the lead-up to the vote on April 28: Israel's war on Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

“This is a priority issue for many Canadians,” said Dania Majid, a Palestinian community advocate and lawyer based in Toronto, in an interview with Truthout. “We are not detached from what is happening in Palestine.”

Last month, a survey commissioned by the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) found that 55 percent of Canadian voters backed a ban on weapons exports to Israel as the war in Gaza dragged on. Another 49 percent said they would support extending that ban to weapons parts and military training, as well.

A recent Canadian Muslim Public Affairs Council (CMPAC) election survey also found that 58 percent of Canadian Muslims said Canada's policy on Palestine was their top concern. More than 86 percent of respondents also said they viewed the Canadian government's position as “completely inadequate.”

And in mid-April, thousands of people from across Canada converged on Parliament Hill in the capital, Ottawa, to demand action from Canada's political leaders to end Israel's war on Gaza.

When the Canadian election campaign began in late March, Palestinians in Gaza were once again facing a deadly and relentless bombardment after Israel broke the ceasefire, and the humanitarian crisis gripping the coastal enclave was deepening by the day.

In the occupied West Bank, frequent Israeli military and settler attacks were forcing thousands of Palestinians from their homes.

In response Majid and other organizers launched a Canada-wide push called “Vote Palestine” to make Palestinian rights an issue in the race.

Despite an election race dominated by anxieties around Trump's threats against Canada as well as housing and grocery costs, activists have forced Palestine into the conversation.

The goal, Majid explained, has been to show Canada's politicians that the situation in Palestine has gone beyond foreign policy to become a domestic political issue — and something that they cannot ignore.

“We want to ask those who are seeking to be our representatives on Parliament Hill what their positions are on Palestine and what they are going to do about supporting Palestinian human rights,” she told Truthout.

“With the genocide still raging [in Gaza], with the ethnic cleansing, land theft and oppression in the West Bank — this is the context this federal election is happening in.”

The focus on Palestine during the federal election campaign comes as Canada has seen months of protests, sit-ins, and other actions spurred by anger over the Israeli bombardment of Gaza and the Canadian government's stance.

Canada has long presented itself as taking a middle ground, backing a two-state solution and stressing the need to uphold international law. 

But Palestinian rights advocates and other experts say that, in practice, Canada has largely sided with Israel, a country with which it maintains strong economic and diplomatic ties.

As the war in Gaza raged, the Canadian government faced calls to act.

A growing chorus of Canadians — from Palestinian, Arab and Muslim community members to health care workers, progressive activists and others — urged the government to pressure Israel to end its military offensive.

Near-weekly protests were held in major Canadian cities, raising awareness about the situation in Gaza. Meanwhile, similar to scenes in the U.S., students at Montreal's McGill University and the University of Toronto erected protest encampments last year to end what they said was their schools' complicity in Israel's war.

Pro-Israel lobby groups and lawmakers urged university administrators to crack down, raising questions about freedom of speech and academic liberties. Nonetheless, the encampments drew support from across Canada.

Protesters demanded Ottawa suspend arms shipments to the Israeli military, denounce Israeli abuses against Palestinians, support efforts at the UN to end the war and protect the rights of people in Canada protesting Israel's policies.

Those were some of the same demands that rang out less than two weeks before Election Day as dozens of people gathered in the Montreal neighborhood of Parc-Extension to send a message to their local political candidates.

The protesters rallying in Papineau (a federal electoral district in Montreal, also known in Canada as a “riding”) on April 19 called for a two-way arms embargo against Israel and an end to the war.

“Whoever wins this election needs to respect the will of this neighborhood, and the will of this neighborhood is solidarity with Palestine,” said Amy Darwish, a member of the activist group Papineau for Palestine, which organized the demonstration.

She said Canadian politicians have long treated Palestine as something they can ignore, but that has been changing.

“[People] have been engaging actively with their candidates to make it very clear that it's not possible to ignore this genocide [in Gaza] and that they absolutely need to take action,” Darwish told Truthout.

The “Vote Palestine” campaign is centered on many of the demands Palestinian rights advocates in Canada have been pushing for over the past 18 months.

The campaign has the backing of several organizations in Canada including CMPAC, World Beyond War, Independent Jewish Voices-Canada, and the Ontario branch of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), the country's largest union.

Organizers have urged political candidates to sign onto its five-point platform, which includes imposing a two-way arms embargo on Israel, recognizing the State of Palestine, and funding the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which provides most of the aid in Gaza.

The platform also calls on Canada to end any involvement in illegal Israeli settlements and address anti-Palestinian racism and efforts to crack down on pro-Palestinian speech domestically.

As of April 21, one week before Election Day, more than 300 electoral candidates had endorsed the full “Vote Palestine” platform.

About two-thirds of the signatories are candidates with the left-wing New Democratic Party (NDP), including NDP leader Jagmeet Singh.

While the NDP has traditionally been seen as the Canadian political party that speaks out the most in defense of Palestinian rights, its record on Palestine over the years has been mixed.

Amid Israel's war on Gaza, the party faced criticism and calls to do more to pressure the Liberal government to take concrete action; now, as the election nears, Singh has been more outspoken and pressured other party leaders to unequivocally condemn Israel's war as a genocide.

Others from the Liberal, Green and Bloc Quebecois parties have also signed on. No Conservative Party candidates have signed the pledge.

Majid, the campaign organizer, said that, as a nonpartisan effort, “Vote Palestine” is not endorsing any parties or candidates.

“This is very much about empowering people because we hear often — and we saw this in the U.S. election — people feel very disenfranchised. They go to the polls, but their representatives never represent them,” Majid said.

“We're trying to get people to check back in and give people the resources and the tools to go and speak to candidates … and share that Palestine is an important issue for them in this election [and] that we shouldn't be putting the genocide to the side.”

Indeed, despite an election race dominated by anxieties around Trump's threats against Canada as well as housing and grocery costs, activists have forced Palestine into the conversation.

Notably, the leaders of Canada's main political parties have been asked about their positions on Gaza during recent debates.

On April 17, frontrunner Mark Carney, who replaced former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the leader of the Liberal Party in March, said Canada must work to impose “maximum pressure” to reach an immediate ceasefire.

He said all captives held in Gaza must also be released and humanitarian aid must resume for Palestinians.

But Carney has drawn criticism for refusing to describe what is happening in Gaza as a “genocide” — a term scholars, human rights groups, and other experts have used to describe Israel's military campaign and siege on the enclave.

“We know that if you can't name genocide, you definitely won't stop it,” the advocacy group Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East said on social media of Carney's stance.

Pro-Israel lobby groups in Canada have been outspoken during the Gaza war, defending the Israeli government's policies and attacking lawmakers who have spoken out about human rights abuses against Palestinians.

Framing their unwavering support for Israel as part of a fight against anti-Semitism, these groups have maintained close ties to Canada's two main political parties — the Liberals and the Conservatives — for years.

Israel, too, has enjoyed friendly relations with both Liberal and Conservative prime ministers. That includes both Trudeau and his Conservative predecessor, Stephen Harper, who was once described by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a “great friend of Israel.” Yet amid the pressure from pro-Palestinian activists during the Gaza war, the Liberals, who have been in power since 2015, have faced angry criticism from the Israeli government for offering limited criticism of the offensive.

The government's announcement that it was barring any Canadian-made arms from reaching Gaza, for example, drew anger among Israeli leaders.

But Canadian weapons and weapons parts are still able to reach Israel via the U.S., researchers have found.

For his part, Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre — whose party is trailing the Liberals after it held a double-digit lead in the polls at the start of the year — has taken a staunchly pro-Israel position.

He has promised to cut funding for UNRWA, the UN agency responsible for delivering humanitarian assistance in Gaza, which he has called a “terrorist” organization.

Poilievre also recently said a Conservative government would deport non-Canadians who take part in what he dubbed “hate marches,” referring to pro-Palestine demonstrations. He also promised a “tougher” response for Canadians who participate.

“We will bring in tougher laws to target vandalism, hate marches that break laws, violent attacks based on ethnicity and religion. Anyone who's here on a visitor visa who carries out lawbreaking will be deported from this country,” he said on April 12.

Poilievre's comments drew comparisons to Trump, whose administration has moved to deport students and permanent residents in the U.S. who have spoken out against Israel's war on Gaza.

“Your treatment of Palestinians has been frankly disgusting,” Singh, the leader of the NDP, told Poilievre during one of the leadership debates.

Khaled Al-Qazzaz, executive director of the CMPAC advocacy group, said the Conservative leader's positions are “not acceptable” for members of Canada's Muslim community.

Recent protests in solidarity with Palestinians have been “peaceful and absent of any form of violence,” said Al-Qazzaz, stressing that Muslim Canadians have been reeling from what is happening in Gaza.

“Gaza until now is being hit, is being bombarded, is being ethnically cleansed, and the community feels that,” he told Truthout.

“The more they [candidates] neglect committing to a principled position, the more irrelevant they become on the world stage, and the less credibility they have with Canadians,” Al-Qazzaz added.

CMPAC launched the website MuslimsVote.ca to encourage political candidates to take what Al-Qazzaz described as a “principled” stance.

To date, the campaign has endorsed 47 candidates it says have expressed support for — or have a strong track record of standing up for — Palestinians. Those candidates are about evenly split between Liberal and NDP candidates.

“The new thing in this election is that this time our community is more organized,” Al-Qazzaz said of the movement.

“There are several organizations that are involved in political organizing, in articulating these policy demands, negotiating and discussing with candidates and politicians, [and] mobilizing people on the ground,” he said. “More importantly, there is more of a united front — whether on the organizational level or [in the] community — that is united by a cause.”

But will Canada's Palestine policy really have an impact on the election outcome?

Al-Qazzaz said he believes Muslim voters can influence races in areas where their communities make up a large chunk of the electorate, such as ridings in the Greater Toronto Area and in British Columbia on Canada's west coast.

The country's Muslim population more than doubled between 2001 and 2021, the last year for which data is available, going from about 580,000 to more than 1.7 million people in that 20-year span. The population is likely even higher today.

“When the race is very close, the difference between the top two [candidates] is less than the number of registered Muslim voters in [some of] these ridings. This makes the Muslim vote an impactful decision-maker, or kingmaker,” Al-Qazzaz said.

Yet whatever happens on April 28, both Al-Qazzaz and Majid stressed that the push to get Canadian politicians to speak out on Palestine will continue beyond the election.

They each described support for Palestinian rights as a “litmus test” that demonstrates not only where a politician stands on foreign policy but on a range of domestic issues as well, including social programs, immigrant rights, and freedoms in Canada.

“If they've signed the pledge, then [there's an opportunity] to ask them what's next, how they're going to operate to realize that pledge. If they haven't signed the pledge, then there's an opportunity to keep that conversation going,” Majid said.

“It doesn't end on Election Day. The real work really starts after Election Day.”

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

President Donald Trump's bold move to hike tariffs on Chinese goods to 145 percent—met by Beijing's 125 percent retaliation—has reignited a national debate over trade, economic independence, and the future of U.S. industry.

A new poll of 18,438 Epoch Times readers shows broad support for Trump's tough stance against the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and its decades-long record of exploiting global trade to the detriment of U.S. manufacturing and national security.

The tariffs target what Trump calls the CCP's predatory tactics: currency manipulation, intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers, and market-warping state subsidies that systematically disadvantage U.S. businesses.

By zeroing in on strategic sectors such as steel, technology, and critical minerals, the administration's trade overhaul aims to close the U.S.–China trade gap, fortify national security, and bring manufacturing back to U.S. soil.

On April 2, Trump imposed a 10 percent baseline tariff on nearly all imports. For roughly 60 countries with large trade surpluses with the United States, he introduced steeper reciprocal tariffs. China, at the top of that list, faces tariffs as high as 245 percent on some products.

When asked whether the 145 percent tariff on Chinese goods is a justified step to hold Beijing accountable, 72 percent of readers strongly agreed that it is, and 13 percent somewhat agreed. Four percent were neutral and a combined 11 percent disagreed.

While some respondents expressed concern about the potential harm to U.S. exporters and consumers, most said they remained unfazed. Twenty-three percent said they agreed—strongly or somewhat—that Beijing's retaliation would cause serious harm, while 34 percent were neutral and 43 percent disagreed.

At the same time, signs of strain are emerging within China itself. Exporters, factory owners, and industry observers have voiced growing alarm as profit margins vanish, orders dry up, and job losses mount.

Critics of Beijing's response argue that the CCP's failure to negotiate may backfire, deepening China's economic isolation just as other nations seek new trade terms with Washington.

A clear majority of readers supported the electronics exemption, with 32 percent strongly agreeing and another 32 percent somewhat agreeing that it was a prudent move. Twelve percent disagreed to some extent, while 24 percent remained neutral.

When asked whether the price of electronics is likely to rise despite the exemption, 23 percent strongly agreed and 40 percent somewhat agreed that it is—meaning a total of 63 percent believe to some degree that prices will rise despite the exemption. Twenty-eight percent were neutral, 6 percent somewhat disagreed, and 3 percent strongly disagreed.

China, which dominates the rare earth mineral market and mines roughly 60 percent of the world's total supply, has imposed export controls on these essential elements as part of its response to the Trump administration's tariffs.

Rare earth metals are a group of 17 essential elements that are critical in many modern technologies, both civilian and military. Securing supply chains for these elements, which have no practical substitutes, has been a priority for Trump as he seeks to strengthen the United States' manufacturing base.

On the issue of China's dominance in rare earth minerals and critical components, 52 percent of respondents said they strongly agree—and 19 percent somewhat agree—that this poses a serious risk to U.S. national security. Fourteen percent were neutral, 8 percent somewhat disagreed, and 7 percent strongly disagreed.

Trump's tariffs are intended to reverse this decades-long decline by shielding domestic industries from the CCP's trade abuses. The effort has raised a fundamental question: Are Americans willing to do factory work in a country where the workforce has largely shifted toward service sector and office jobs?

According to the poll, the answer is yes. A strong majority—74 percent—said they believe that Americans are willing to return to factory jobs if those opportunities come back. Fifteen percent were neutral, while 11 percent expressed skepticism.

Respondents also emphasized the critical role of education and job training. Half of all participants strongly agreed that the United States cannot rebuild a strong manufacturing base without serious reforms in vocational and technical education. An additional 25 percent somewhat agreed, while 15 percent expressed disagreement or uncertainty.

Respondents also showed strong support for education and vocational training reform as a foundation for rebuilding the domestic industry. Half of all respondents said they strongly agree that without serious reforms in education and job training, the United States cannot rebuild a strong manufacturing base. Twenty-five percent somewhat agreed, 10 percent were neutral, 8 percent somewhat disagreed, and 7 percent strongly disagreed.

However, when asked whether a lack of skilled labor and waning interest in factory work is a greater obstacle than policy or taxes, opinion was more divided. While 41 percent agreed that it is, 25 percent were neutral, and 34 percent disagreed—suggesting that many see government policy as the more significant barrier to reshoring U.S. manufacturing.

“At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable,” he said.

Although Trump has offered to lower tariffs if Beijing engages in serious negotiations, the CCP has shown little interest in compromise.

When asked whether the Chinese regime would change course without sustained economic pressure, an overwhelming 86 percent of poll respondents agreed that it would, with 75 percent strongly agreeing. Nine percent disagreed, and 4 percent were neutral.

In contrast, there was little faith in diplomacy alone. Seventeen percent said they believe that alliances and diplomatic engagement offer a better long-term strategy for confronting the CCP, while 70 percent disagreed.

By contrast, 10 percent strongly agreed that diplomacy and alliances—not tariffs—are the better long-term path to confronting Beijing. Seven percent somewhat agreed, while 13 percent were neutral, 26 percent somewhat disagreed, and 44 percent strongly disagreed.

The poll also revealed a near-unanimous view that China's track record—on intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers, and product dumping—has undermined global trade fairness. Eighty-four percent strongly agreed, and another 6 percent somewhat agreed. Six percent disagreed.

Poll results show overwhelming support for that vision. Eighty-nine percent of respondents said that rebuilding manufacturing is critical to national strength and global leadership, while 7 percent disagreed.

When asked which factors are most critical to bringing manufacturing back, respondents pointed to education, tax policy, and cultural values. Eighty-one percent cited better technical education and job training, 78 percent favored tax and regulatory incentives for reshoring, and 72 percent emphasized the need to restore respect for skilled labor. Sixty-four percent supported a more competitive overall tax and regulatory environment, while 60 percent identified stronger tariffs and trade enforcement. Respondents could select multiple answers.

There was clear frustration with what many described as an underprepared, over-entitled workforce. Readers also expressed concern that the “college for all” mindset has undermined the value of skilled trades. Some called for banning social media in classrooms, dismantling the Department of Education, and returning to character-based instruction rooted in discipline, patriotism, and a good work ethic.

While energy policy, government incentives, and cultural attitudes were also mentioned, education was repeatedly cited as the root challenge—and the key to the United States' industrial revival.

Suggestions included steep and escalating tariffs—some as high as 500 percent—total economic decoupling, and bans on Chinese imports. Others called for removing Chinese nationals involved in espionage or influence operations. Several respondents blamed decades of U.S. corporate and political naivete for empowering Beijing at the expense of U.S. industry and sovereignty.

While many still championed bringing key industries—such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and defense—back to U.S. soil, others emphasized that modern manufacturing is increasingly automated. They warned against nostalgic ideas of factory floors packed with workers, and instead pushed for strategic planning focused on innovation, high-tech infrastructure, and workforce readiness.

Several respondents also noted that reshoring would likely raise consumer prices, and that a cultural shift—toward valuing industrial work and recognizing the changing nature of manufacturing in the 21st century—will be necessary.

Together, the poll results and written responses reflect more than support for Trump's tariff strategy—they reveal a deeper desire for structural reform, cultural renewal, and national resilience.

For many Epoch Times readers, restoring U.S. manufacturing is about more than just jobs or economics—it's about rebuilding the foundations of American strength, independence, and identity.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

It could take up to five years to develop a domestic supply chain to supplant China's global monopoly in processing rare earths into materials needed to produce everything from iPhones to F-35 fighter jets.

While the United States has most of the 17 rare earth elements and 50 critical minerals underground, it has no industrial capacity to refine them into processed metals and magnets, according to Melissa “Mel” Sanderson, American Rare Earths board member and Critical Minerals Institute co-chair.

“Currently in the United States, we have zero magnet manufacturers,” Sanderson told The Epoch Times.

“I certainly hope, as the administration is working through this critical area—no pun intended, it's a critical area—they realize there's this vulnerability gap, a four to five year gap, no matter how you look at it, in terms of ramping up domestic production,” Sanderson said.

Trump's April 2 order gives Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick 180 days to suggest how the federal government can help develop a “circular” domestic rare earth supply chain.

The president is also pondering an order allowing deep-sea mining and commercial stockpiling.

Whatever the administration does, with enough permit reform, deregulation, and public-private incentivizing, industry will respond, economist Antonio Graceffo told The Epoch Times.

“The short answer is if China bans the sale of rare earth minerals to the United States” permanently, “that's a positive thing because it's going to force the United States to find a solution,” he said.

An analyst who writes about U.S.–China trade relations for The Epoch Times, Graceffo said there are “tons of solutions” to building a domestic rare earth supply chain, including the ongoing negotiations with Ukraine.

“Absolutely, we can overcome the problem,” he said. “In the long run, it's going to be much better if China cuts us off. [Industry] will definitely find a way.”

Colorado School of Mines economics professor Ian Lange agrees. “I'm on the optimistic side,” he said.

Lange said there are substitute materials for the seven restricted rare earths, and some manufacturers are telling him they'll survive without them.

He questioned if China can sustain its rare earth export restrictions because American industries are their biggest market.

“We'll see if this is a real or just another hoop to jump through,” Lange told The Epoch Times. “And we have been slowly building up the supply chain over the last couple years.

“We're getting close to having something here in the United States.”

It will also process dysprosium and terbium, two of the seven restricted “heavies,” by building a refinery near its Halleck Creek mine outside Wheatland, Wyoming. Dysprosium is used in magnets incorporated in motors and generators for wind turbines, electrical vehicles, and nuclear reactor control rods. Terbium compounds are used in electronics, semiconductors, and fluorescent lighting.

Also in Wyoming, Ramaco Resources is breaking ground on an estimated 1.5 billion-ton rare earth deposit and pilot processing plant at its Brook Mine, while Rare Element Resources has started “proprietary processing and separation operations” at its Bear Lodge demonstration plant in Upton.

Oklahoma-based USA Rare Earths, which is opening a “neo-magnet” factory this year, produced its first sample of dysprosium oxide from its Round Top, Texas, mine this year and processed it at its research plant in Wheat Ridge, Colorado.

Ucore Rare Metals is developing the Louisiana Strategic Metals Complex in Alexandria with $20 million in state incentives, and Energy Fuels, a uranium mining company, is processing monazite sands to extract rare earths at its White Mesa Mill in Utah.

Both are Canadian-owned corporations.

The two most prominent rare earth operators in the United States are Australia's Lynas Rare Earths, the world's largest rare earth developer outside China, and Las Vegas-based MP Materials Corp.

Both are crucial in processing rare earths for the U.S. Department of Defense, which is midway through a five-year plan to build a “sustainable mine-to-magnet supply chain” to support its needs by 2027.

The Pentagon said in January it doubled its initial project request beyond military requirements to “strengthen supply chain resilience for … burgeoning high-tech industry as well as … national security needs.”

In 2024, MP Materials achieved an all-time U.S. high output at Mountain Pass, delivering more than 45,000 metric tons of rare earth oxides and refined products.

The output included a U.S. record of 1,300 tons of neodymium-praseodymium oxide, key elements in “permanent magnets,” which retain their magnetic strength for decades.

“This milestone marks a major step forward in restoring a fully integrated rare earth magnet supply chain in the United States,” MP Materials CEO and founder James Litinsky said in a January statement.

“We have reached a significant turning point for MP and U.S. competitiveness in a vital sector.”

Yet, both Lynas Rare Earth and MP Materials produce more rare earth ore than they can process. To sustain operations, they must export much of what they excavate.

“MP is basically China's largest offshore supplier” of rare earth ore, Critical Minerals Institute Executive Chair Jack Lifton said, noting China-based Shanghai Resources Industrial & Trading Co. bought 32,000 tons worth $350 million from MP Materials in 2024.

MP Materials did not return phone calls or email interview requests.

If China has to pay a 145 percent tariff to export processed rare earth minerals to the United States, “it would be financial suicide to keep that [export pace] up because they couldn't do it—it would cost them more than it's worth,” Lifton told The Epoch Times.

Meredith Schwartz, research associate at the Center for Strategic & International Studies's Project on Critical Minerals Security, said Lynas, despite being the largest producer outside China, still sends oxides to China because it does not have enough refining capacity.

“But even when these facilities are fully operational” at MP Materials and Lynas in the United States, they are nowhere near commercial capacity and dwarfed by China's output, Schwartz said.

While MP Materials produced 1,300 tons of neodymium-praseodymium oxide in 2024, “in the same year, China produced an estimated 300,000 tons,” she said.

Progress is being made, but there are setbacks and challenges, Schwartz said, noting that while USA Rare Earths

called purifying its first dysprosium oxide “a breakthrough” for the domestic rare earths industry, “significant work remains to turn production of samples in a laboratory into full-scale commercial production.”

“Even with recent investments the United States is a long way off from meeting the [Department of Defense] goal for a mine-to-magnet supply chain independent of China, and is even further from rivaling foreign adversaries in this strategic industry,” she said.

“Developing mining and processing capabilities requires a long-term effort, meaning the United States will be on the back foot for the foreseeable future.”

It recommends Congress incentivize domestic production of rare earth magnets through tax breaks to U.S. manufacturers, which Graceffo endorses as long as it comes with long-awaited permit reform.

“It's going to be a matter of Trump repealing or rolling back some of the environmental restrictions, and probably some of our allies doing the same thing,” he said, suggesting American manufacturers will develop efficiencies to produce better, less-expensive products.

“Once you bring those things back home, you've got all those great minds, all those educated people, motivated by profit. It's actually going to advance technological development because we're going to find even better ways to do things,” Graceffo said.

“When you're paying $25, $30 an hour to factory workers, you're very incentivized to find more efficient ways to do things rather than when you're in China paying 8 cents an hour.”

Sanderson said the Trump administration “is doing a heroic effort in addressing major pinch points that have affected the industry chronically in this country for the last 50 years or so.”

She said permitting reform is the first of those pinch points.

“The system is antiquated, inefficient, and subject to excessive litigation, which is what keeps good projects on the chalkboard for 20-plus years,” she said. “So they're addressing that. They're removing those barriers.”

Lifton said the Trump administration must establish a China-free “organized market” for rare earths. He's surprised industry groups haven't already done so.

“There's no common thread, no common ground organization. You'd think, for example, the car companies all get together and say, ‘Listen, we're not going to talk about our competitive [issues], relative costs, what our next year's model looks like, we're going to talk about common sourcing of rare earth permanent magnet motors because we all need that,'” he said.

Sanderson said another rare earth pinch point being addressed by the administration is a new “form of private public partnership” using Development Finance Corp. and Department of Defense money “to serve as an anchor for attracting private investment.”

American Rare Earths, for instance, received its $456 million authorization from the U.S. Export-Import Bank through the president's executive actions mandating supply chain resiliency, she said.

“The Ex-Im Bank was never set up to fund these projects” until it was directed to do so by the president.

Under the administration's changes, a mine project doesn't need a customer “guaranteed to buy all or a portion of the output,” to qualify for grants and loans, which makes the process faster, Sanderson said.

Financing is an issue in the mining industry, but of acute concern in rare earths development, she said.

“You found a lot of nice rocks in the ground. Goody for you. Now you need to be funded to transform yourself into an actual mining company,” she said. “U.S. banks don't tend to lend to that.”

Rare earth mining and processing is “extremely capital intensive and once you have invested and you have started with the operations … these guys, they won't invest if they don't see they're going to be operating the mine for 10 or 20 years,” said Didier Lesueur, CEO of the Western Research Institute in Laramie, Wyoming.

Lifton said “big capital is not interested” in rare earths. He noted that corporate global mining companies such as Rio Tinto don't want to mine rare earths.

“So, no matter how much you talk about this, it's a small business” in the context of the mining industry, he said.

Extracting rare earths from “host rocks” is “a black art kind of thing. It's proprietary, a lot of proprietary operations. Nobody tells you exactly how they do things, and even when they do, you need to be a super specialist to understand,” Lifton said.

There are many expensive steps between the ground and the market, “and by the way, you have to dig up the stuff … that's very expensive,” he said.

Sanderson said it's difficult to extract the rare earths from within the material they're embedded “and concentrate that to a level that makes the project economically viable.”

“Not all deposits ‘concentrate' sufficiently to make them bankable,” she said.

Timelines are also difficult to benchmark in rare earths development, she said.

“Any estimate any company gives—in any industry for that matter—on when they think a new plant or a new mine or a new processing facility is going to come online, is always a best-guess estimate based on a best-case scenario—where the supply chain doesn't collapse, the price doesn't become unmanageable, the weather cooperates, yada yada, yada yada.”

Nevertheless, Lifton said, with more than $400 billion in tax credits and other incentives available through 2022's Inflation Reduction Act—at least for now—“Washington is floating on money for these projects.”

Lesueur said building a domestic rare earth supply chain will take time, and it's worth taking the time to get it right.

“Can it be done rapidly? No,” he said. “Sustainably? Yes. It takes time because most of these projects, such as American Rare Earth's Halleck Creek mine, are “green field projects” meaning, they're starting from scratch.

Right now, the nation's rare earths industry is “just small stuff in a big spot of land,” Sanderson said. “But hey, you start small and you grow, right?”","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

 Shira Efron and Danny Citrinowicz

In the months since Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime collapsed, Israel's military activity in Syria has grown increasingly aggressive. The Israel Defense Forces has seized the UN-monitored buffer zone created after the 1973 Yom Kippur War, conducted systematic strikes against Syria's infrastructure—bombing air defense networks, weapons depots, missile systems, and intelligence capabilities—and built nine new military posts. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz has repeatedly declared that the IDF will remain in Syria “indefinitely.” And in March, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced plans to create zones of influence by making alliances with minority groups, as well as to establish a 30-mile demilitarized area reaching from Israel's nearly to Damascus.

All of this represents a sharp break with Israel's longtime cautious approach toward its northeastern neighbor. Israel had felt that it could manage the Assad regime, and the IDF's actions after December began as a prudent effort to prevent strategic capabilities from falling into less well-known hands. Israeli concern about Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Shara, is warranted, given his past terrorist associations and the fact that his previous military moniker, al-Jolani, reflected his desire to free the Golan Heights from Israeli occupation. But now Israel is overreaching. After it took Damascus, Syria's new regime bent over backward to signal that it had no interest in conflict with Israel and even floated the possibility of normalizing ties. The new Syrian government needs to be judged by its actions and not only its words. But it presents Israel with a potentially golden opportunity to deepen Iran's isolation, turn Syria from a foe into a peaceful neighbor, and stabilize its region.

Although genuine national security concerns are driving the Israeli government's approach to Syria, so is a yearning to prove its strength and willpower to its neighbors as well as its own citizens, who are deeply scarred by their government's failure to protect the country's borders on October 7, 2023. If Israel's leaders give in to the impulse to ramp up its incursions into Syria, they may well create a new enemy when there is currently none. And Israel will put itself even more at odds with Turkey, driving both countries toward the brink of an unnecessary new military conflict. Instead, Israel must communicate that its territorial incursions are meant to be temporary, help ease Syria's humanitarian crisis, and stop undermining Turkey's attempts to help Shara stabilize the country and stand up to Iranian influence. Israel should also prepare to work with Damascus as long as it neither takes nor enables actions that threaten Israel's security.

Under a quarter century of rule by Assad, Syria became an integral part of Iran's so-called axis of resistance. Assad worked to deepen his strategic alliance with Hezbollah, helping to transform the Lebanese militant group into a menacing terrorist army by allowing it to use Syrian arsenals and strategic capabilities that Assad received from Russia, such as advanced ballistic missiles and air defense systems. Israel was traumatized by its 2006 war against Hezbollah (which Hezbollah saw as a victory), and the Israelis spent the next decade mostly refraining from trying to disrupt Syria's alliance with the group. When the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011, Israel did try to prevent the consolidation of Hezbollah and Iran's footholds in Syria by conducting what it called the “campaign between the wars,” focusing mainly on preventing Iran from smuggling weapons into Lebanon. But although Israel officially supported neither side in Syria's civil war, Israeli leaders preferred Assad to his opponents, referring to him in private as the “devil we know” and making sure that Israel's efforts to counter Iran's growing influence would not risk his rule.

Israel's approach in Syria did not immediately change following Hamas's October 7, 2023 onslaught. But that devastating assault set changes in motion. The attack made it clear that Israel had misjudged both the intentions and capabilities of an adversary; it was clear that the country's security services had also relied excessively on electronic monitoring to secure the border with Gaza. The lesson that many Israeli officials took was that their strategy of “quiet for quiet”—turning a blind eye to small provocations to avoid major conflict—had failed. Consequently, the IDF changed its doctrine along all of Israel's borders, emphasizing preemptive action and creating so-called buffer zones in adversaries' territory.

Over the past 18 months, Israel's appetite to consolidate buffer zones has only grown. In March 2025, Defense Minister Katz said that the IDF's expanding ground operations in Gaza were intended, in part, to “capture extensive territory” that would be permanently “added to the State of Israel's security areas.” In Lebanon, despite signing a ceasefire with Hezbollah in November—and despite the fact that a new, less Hezbollah-friendly government took over Beirut in February—the IDF retains a presence at five strategic points near the border. This is meant to reassure Israeli border communities that they will never again be left defenseless.

Even though Israel's fatal campaign against Hezbollah and its deterrence efforts against Iran—as well as Russia's preoccupation in Ukraine—had left Assad defenseless, his regime's collapse took Israel by surprise. Israel had to develop a new Syria strategy on the fly. Immediately, Israel moved to destroy Syrian air force bases, military aircraft, and missile depots; bolstered its border defenses; and took over the UN's 145-square-mile buffer zone. The IDF erected new posts inside Syria, paved access roads, dug trenches, and positioned hundreds of soldiers there.

Given that Syria's new regime does not present Israel with an imminent threat, however, this approach has much less strategic merit than it does in Lebanon. The Israeli-Syrian border has remained peaceful throughout the Gaza war, and Israelis living along it have not had to leave. Damascus's new leaders have repeatedly stressed that they plan to include minorities and secular Syrians in their government and establish their credibility with Western actors. Shara's government abandoned Syria's long-standing official anti-Israeli rhetoric. Shara also pledged to uphold the Agreement on Disengagement that Syria and Israel had inked in 1974, which provided for an indefinite cease-fire. “We do not want any conflict, whether with Israel or anyone else,” he declared in December, adding that he would not “let Syria be used as a launchpad for attacks.”

It remains to be seen how closely Shara will adhere to these vows. But instead of waiting and seeing, many Israeli leaders have begun to treat Shara's government as if it is simply destined to be yet another adversary. In late December, the IDF invaded at least two other areas in Syria beyond the buffer zone and increased the frequency and scale of its strikes deep into Syrian territory, although the tempo has declined over the past two weeks. Israel says some of its actions are intended to protect minority groups, particularly the Druze, who are potential allies. Yet many members of the Syrian Druze community view Israel's claims to be their ally with suspicion: in mid-March, protests broke out in the majority-Druze Syrian town of Suwayda, during which Druze leaders accused Israel of undermining Syria's territorial integrity. Israel's attempt to create partnerships with non-Sunni Muslim minorities cuts against most war-weary Syrians' wish for a unified and stable country.

Meanwhile, Netanyahu's insistence that the entirety of Syria south of Damascus must be “demilitarized” is a goal Shara will be hard-pressed to accept, as it would likely mean ceding control over this area. Israel has also been undermining Shara by lobbying the United States to maintain its sanctions on Syria and closely coordinating with Moscow to help Russia keep its military bases. Israel's overture toward Russia is puzzling, considering that the Russian intervention in Syria to save Assad a decade ago helped entrench Iranian influence in the Middle East.



Israel's mistrust of Shara's government constitutes another paradox. Israeli leaders have accused Shara's team of hiding its true colors: in March, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar claimed that the people on Shara's team “were jihadists and remain jihadists, even if some of their leaders have donned suits.” But Israel is counting on Shara's anti-Iran stance to stop Iran from reestablishing its regional influence. And although undermining Shara's power may strengthen Israel's grip on its buffer zone in the short term, the country's long-term interest is in a stable Syria.

Israel has also been working to prevent Turkey from consolidating influence in Syria. Israel has foiled Turkish efforts to rebuild the Syrian army's capabilities by bombing air bases that Ankara sought to take over. Israeli official discourse has increasingly treated Turkey as an enemy: a January 2025 report by a government-appointed committee on the defense budget, for instance, referred to the “Turkish threat,” alleging that Turkey hopes to render the Syrian military “a Turkish proxy as part of Turkey's dream of restoring the Ottoman crown to its former glory.” That, in turn, would “deepen the danger of a direct Turkish-Israeli confrontation.” In late March, Sa'ar posted on social media that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is “anti-Semitic” and a “threat” to “the region.”

Israeli leaders seem bent on understanding their country as imperiled—and tempted to substitute the diminished threat posed by the Iranian axis of resistance with a purported new Turkish one. Erdogan has done his part to damage relations between the countries, in 2024 comparing Netanyahu to Hitler and accusing Israel of war crimes in Gaza. Ankara wants to add Syria to its sphere of influence, which could hinder the Israeli military's freedom of action and bring Turkish troops to Israel's doorstep. Yet Turkey is not Israel's adversary: the two countries, both U.S. allies, share strong economic and security interests, and Israel should not aggravate NATO's largest military while fighting a multifront war.

Israel's posture certainly reflects the country's more externally aggressive post–October 7 mindset. But it also has domestic motives. Netanyahu's political base relishes social media posts showing IDF tanks cruising Syria. Furthermore, Netanyahu's coalition likely hopes that offering protection to the Druze in Syria could appeal to members of the Israeli Druze community, who are loyal Israeli citizens and serve in the IDF yet suffer from discrimination compared with the country's Jewish majority.

But Israel's approach in Syria is already backfiring. On February 2, Syrian Defense Minister Murhaf Abu Qasra told The Washington Post that the IDF's incursions were a “violation against the Syrian people,” a pivot from the Shara regime's initial practice of not criticizing Israel. He complained that Israel showed little gratitude for how Shara's takeover helped deter Iran, a common enemy: “They had a problem with Iran; we saved them from Iran.” For several months, Shara refrained from criticizing Israel's escalatory behavior, which Israeli leaders could have taken as a hopeful sign. But in March, Shara himself began to express anger, defining Israel's advances as “hostile expansionism.”

In late March and early April, IDF troops in Syria came under fire by unknown militants. If Israel keeps up its aggressive stance, Shara—who has been courting Syrian minorities—could allow or even back such militant groups' attacks on IDF troops, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Resentment toward the IDF could increase the potential for insurgency, which, in turn, would likely pull the IDF deeper into Syrian territory.



If the new Syrian government remains moderate and can consolidate its authority, the upside for Israel would be huge. It would have a stable neighbor not beholden to Iran—one that possesses an effective military that can do its own work to address threats from extremist groups. Israel is not a passive bystander to the trajectory of Syrian politics. It can encourage Shara's moderation by welcoming Damascus's overtures, such as the arrest, on April 21, of two senior leaders of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group. Further, Israel should articulate publicly that its territorial advances are designed to be temporary until a responsible force can secure the other side of the border. Until Damascus has such capabilities, Israel should minimize friction with Syria's population and its new government by reducing its visible military footprint and communicating with Shara's team through back channels. At the same time, Israel should capitalize on the gains it has made to secure the Israeli-Syrian border by demanding a diplomatic agreement to ensure the protection of Syria's Druze community and to demilitarize the Golan Heights.

Israel must also change its approach to Turkey. In a meeting with Netanyahu earlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Erdogan and called for the two countries to repair their relationship. But if Trump follows through on his intent to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria, that may leave Israel and Turkey to bicker over the country without adult supervision. On April 9, a round of talks began between Israel and Turkey, mediated by Azerbaijan. Israel should use these discussions not only to establish a deconfliction mechanism but to deescalate tensions altogether.

Israel's current approach resembles its efforts to create a security zone in southern Lebanon in the 1980s and 1990s—which resulted in a war of attrition that deepened Lebanese resentment and made it much easier for Hezbollah to take over the country upon the IDF's withdrawal in 2000. Israel must not repeat this mistake. The Israeli government should work more closely with regional and international partners to keep Syria from again falling into the Iranian orbit as well as to disable and remove the residues of biological and chemical weapons left over from the Assad era. Israel could also relieve Syria's economic crisis by helping to provide the country with energy, food, and water. That—more than showy military incursions without a complementary diplomatic strategy—will help Israel secure the regional influence it truly wants.

            By conventional measures, Donald Trump's second presidency is already descending into disarray amid a legal morass, self-inflicted errors, and a vast gap between its massive ambition and its capacity to enact that vision.
    


            Yet Trump's tens of millions of supporters didn't send a conventional president back to the White House – and don't judge their hero's performance by traditional yardsticks.
    


            On one hand, exhausting crises on multiple fronts point to a potentially failed administration. But as Trump attempts to destroy governing structures at home and abroad, chaos is itself a marker of success.
    


            So the question, as Trump transitions from the shock-and-awe euphoria start of his second term to grinding out his priorities, becomes what kind of event could cause these two competing realities to collide.
    


            A recession that the president seems determined to talk the country into might puncture the bubble of achievement that the White House aggressively cultivates each day. High prices and job losses, after all, don't discriminate between Republican and Democratic voters.
    


            Or perhaps it would take a national security crisis precipitated by his volatile leadership and callow foreign policy team to destroy Trump's presidency. Even then, Trump's hold on his supporters is so strong, nothing might shake their confidence even if he alienates the middle-ground voters who helped reelect him. This, after all, is a president who convinced millions that the fair election he lost in 2020 was a stitch-up.

            Still, if Trump somehow manages to secure a better deal for US manufacturers with his tariff wars, he might justify the mayhem he's visited on financial markets. If “America first” really does convince Europe to defend itself and the president's vows to forge peace work, the world may end up safer.
    


            But hubris is threatening an administration that has made overreaches by previous presidents seem tame by comparison.
    


            “You were overwhelmingly elected by the biggest majority … Americans want you to be president,” Attorney General Pam Bondi gushed to Trump last week during a Cabinet meeting, suggesting the Trump team has misread its supposed mandate.
    


            Trump's victory, while clear, was not a landslide. Together with a tiny GOP majority in the House, it's a thin political platform on which to base an attempt to simultaneously remake the global geopolitical system and the world trading paradigm; to transform the US government; and to destroy elite establishment centers of power.
    


            Weeks ago, the Washington narrative was that Trump's second-term team would be more disciplined and unified than his first. But that's looking increasingly threadbare. The president badly needs some swift wins – not just those that reward his MAGA base – to sustain his credibility.
    


A sense of disorder is mounting.



            — Backbiting and organizational chaos at the Pentagon came after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed fears about his fitness for the job by posting details of military strikes in Yemen on two Signal chats.
    


            — Trump's trade wars have wiped trillions off global stock markets and are likely soon to hike prices for inflation-weary US shoppers. His threats against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have shattered investor confidence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is heading to its worst April since the Great Depression. And amazingly, the world is wondering whether the dollar is a haven anymore. All of this may be behind an apparent and emerging climbdown that the administration signaled on Tuesday on the China tariffs and Trump's warnings that he might fire the central bank chief.
    


            — His purge of first-term officials who knew how Washington worked is resulting in embarrassing accidents.  An undocumented migrant from Maryland was deported by mistake to El Salvador, igniting a massive legal showdown. And the administration set off a feud with Harvard University, apparently by mistake.
    


            — Trump's claims that the force of his personality alone would end wars made him look foolish. His Ukraine peace effort looks amateur. Carnage is still raging in Gaza. He's destroyed America's closest diplomatic friendship, with Canada, with unhinged demands it become the 51st state. His bullying means many tourists are staying away, frightened by potential harassment at US borders. Allies are making alternative arrangements, thereby diminishing American power.
    


            — There has been no blizzard of lawmaking to bolster Trump's claims he's had the most successful first 100 days in generations. How Republicans will pass his huge tax plan is unclear. And a future Democratic president could wipe out his multitudes of executive orders with a stroke of their own pen.
    


            — Tax season at the Internal Revenue Service was marked by dysfunction, with a revolving door of acting commissioners at the key agency.
    


            — Elon Musk's evisceration of the US government may be setting up a series of disasters that are not yet evident. Massive funding cuts may gut US emergency preparedness as hurricane season approaches. Canceled health research on diseases like cancer may cause unnecessary deaths in years to come. The mistaken firing and hurried rehiring of technicians who look after nuclear weapons seems like an emblem of the Tesla chief's tenure in Washington, which he said on Tuesday he'd soon begin to scale back.
    


            — And Trump's incessant demands for more power have pushed the United States to the brink of one of the worst constitutional crises in 250 years. The forest of legal challenges has also severely disrupted many of the administration's top priorities, including its signature mass deportation program.
    


            The White House, however, insists that such damning assessments do not recognize what it regards as a spectacular record of success.
    


            And while Trump world's creation of alternative facts has reached stunning new heights in his second term, there is some logic to their arguments.
    


            The president has never made much pretense of governing for the entire country. His presidencies have been a long succession of attempts to gratify his political base.
    


            That lens is the best way to understand his second term.
    


            Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is the culmination of decades of conservative hopes to dismantle the mighty federal machine. This is not just an ideological goal, although hostility to government is one of the few common themes of two great GOP codes, Reaganism and Trumpism. Many Republican officials believe that the civil service has always been a liberal check on their presidents' power. And if attempts to shatter that stranglehold don't ultimately result in the full dismantling of what Trump first-term political guru Steve Bannon calls the administrative state, then paralyzing government might work almost as well. It's going to be all but impossible for a future Democratic president to quickly rebuild what Musk has destroyed.
    


            Trump's belief in almost absolute presidential power horrifies his critics. But millions of Americans voted for this. He made no secret on the campaign trail of his intention to weaponize presidential power and the Justice Department to pursue his enemies. “It's good to have a strong man at the head of a country,” Trump reflected during a campaign appearance in early 2024, in remarks that explain his domestic and foreign policies.
    


            One of the most controversial aspects of that vision is playing out in the deportations of undocumented migrants to a notorious prison in El Salvador, including that of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.
    


            But the White House loves the fight. It's failed to prove Abrego Garcia is a terrorist and a gang member. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stoked the fire again on Tuesday. “We were always right. The president was always on the right side of this issue to deport this illegal criminal from our community.” When Trump said last week that he'd like to deport US citizen criminals to El Salvador, he knew his audience. And on this immigration issue, he has some genuine results to show for his efforts. Border crossings are down significantly compared with the days of the Biden administration.
    


            Trump's tariff wars seem insane to Wall Street investors and middle-class Americans who've seen their 401(k) plans plummet. But the Trump administration is betting on a different audience – working Americans in rural areas and states devastated by globalization who helped elect him twice. “We shipped countless jobs overseas and, with them, our capacity to make things – from furniture, appliances, and even weapons of war,” Vice President JD Vance said in India on Tuesday. He added: “Many were proud of where they came from: their way of life, the kind of jobs they worked, and the kind of jobs their parents worked before them.”
    


            Trump's America first creed horrifies the foreign policy establishment and threatens to undo generations of US leadership. But those are the same experts who ran the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and are reviled by Trump's base. America's reputation abroad is being slammed by Trump's dismantling of USAID, genuflection to Russian President Vladimir Putin and abandonment of Africa. But Trump and his supporters care little for allies. He'd rather be feared than liked.
    


            A veteran of those early 21st-century wars, Hegseth now runs the Pentagon. His defenestration of senior uniformed officers who advocated diversity might be unfairly wrecking military careers and rocking the leadership of the world's most lethal military. But the former Fox News anchor has the support of conservative media – one reason Trump is standing by him despite reports of his cavalier attitude to classified information. Leavitt hinted at the strategy behind Hegseth's selection and retention on Tuesday, saying, “There's a lot of people in this city who reject monumental change, and I think, frankly, that's why we've seen a smear campaign against the secretary of defense since the moment that President Trump announced his nomination before the United States Senate.”
    


            A similar distaste for the establishment also explains Trump's showdown with Harvard. It might have been mistakenly started, but the clash is exactly the kind of issue the White House seeks – placing Trump on the side of the overwhelming majority of Americans who didn't attend Ivy League colleges. If Democrats chose to defend these bastions of elitism, so much the better for Trump's political cause.
    


            History will form its own judgments on the second term of Trump. But as the daily pandemonium unfolds, it's worth remembering that this divisive presidency can look like a dangerous failure to half the country while manifesting as a stunning success to the other half.
    


            If America was ever united by a common version of reality, that's no longer the case.

Follow:


            A defiant Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth booked himself on the television network where he used to work as a host Tuesday morning in a bid to address the fallout over revelations that he discussed military plans in a second Signal group chat, this time with his wife and brother.
    


            But after Hegseth faced multiple direct questions in the Fox News interview about his inner circle being in disarray, the appearance was seen by some officials as only calling more attention to the story rather than tamping down the coverage, according to two people familiar with how the interview was perceived within the administration.
    


            Yet President Donald Trump is unlikely to dismiss Hegseth and has spoken to him twice since The New York Times and CNN reported on the second Signal group on Sunday night. In their first call, Trump said he had Hegseth's back and voiced frustration at “leakers” he said were trying to damage his administration, according to a person familiar with the conversation.
    


            Trump has since been soliciting feedback from people around him about Hegseth's performance during conversations, according to two people familiar with the comments. So far, most, if not all, has been positive about the Pentagon chief. Trump is extremely hesitant to fire any Cabinet official at this point in his term, much less Hegseth, given how hard his team fought to get him confirmed in the first place.
    


            Yet the state of affairs in his inner circle has troubled some senior officials who want to see changes made to how the secretary's team in the front office of the Pentagon operates. The chaos prevailing at the Pentagon has not been lost on the White House, where officials have watched with concern as Hegseth struggles to contain the dysfunction and as his inner circle implodes.
    


            Hegseth's most trusted advisers are now his wife, his lawyer and his junior military aide, who may soon be appointed his new chief of staff, multiple people familiar with the matter said.
    


            Others close to Hegseth, including his adviser, retired Army Sgt. Maj. Eric Geressy — who served with Hegseth in Iraq and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross last month — have gotten so frustrated by the turmoil that they have indicated to colleagues that they may resign, two of the sources said. CNN has reached out to Geressy.
    


            Some of Hegseth's closest former advisers have issued warnings this week about turmoil inside the Pentagon. They include his former spokesman John Ullyot and three former senior officials Hegseth fired last week: top adviser Dan Caldwell; deputy chief of staff Darin Selnick; and Colin Carroll, who was chief of staff to the deputy secretary of defense.
    


            “It's been a month of total chaos at the Pentagon. From leaks of sensitive operational plans to mass firings, the dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president — who deserves better from his senior leadership,” Ullyot said in a statement obtained by CNN.
    


            One congressional Republican, Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, escalated his public calls Tuesday for Hegseth to be held accountable.
    


            Asked Tuesday by CNN's Jake Tapper on “The Lead” what he would do if he were president and his defense secretary had acted as Hegseth did, Bacon said, “I would hold them accountable, and I'd fire them.” Putting sensitive information on an application like Signal, Bacon said, was “very foolish,” but Hegseth's response — describing the chat earlier Tuesday on Fox as “informal, unclassified coordinations for media coordination and other things” — exacerbated the offense.
    


            “He could recover from that with candor. But when you deny it's a problem, I think it even makes it worse,” Bacon said.
    


            Carroll's firing has also strained Hegseth's relationship with Deputy Secretary of Defense Steve Feinberg, who brought Carroll on as his chief of staff and was not consulted before he was placed on leave, the sources said.
    


            “He is in full paranoia, back-against-the-wall mode,” said one of the sources familiar with Hegseth's state of mind over the last month.
    


            Hegseth's now-former chief of staff, Joe Kasper, had repeatedly clashed in recent months with the three men Hegseth dismissed last week, the sources told CNN.
    


            Several West Wing staffers had grown frustrated about what they described to others as Kasper's lack of responsiveness, often complaining about the difficulty in getting Hegseth's chief of staff on the phone or to respond to their requests. At one point toward the beginning of Hegseth's tenure, the White House was trying to reach Kasper to get Hegseth to sign a memo kickstarting the process of developing Trump's Golden Dome missile shield, but the memo went unsigned for three weeks, according to a person familiar with the matter.
    


            In another example of the disorderly nature of the front office, at one point in March, Hegseth directly asked the director of DoD's special access programs – which are among the most highly classified programs within the DoD – to read Elon Musk into more than two dozen programs having to do with China, according to multiple people familiar with the episode. But Hegseth did not first run the idea through a policy process that included lawyers, the people said, and ultimately, DoD ethics lawyers in the Standards of Conduct office said it would not be appropriate. The idea died. The people familiar with the matter said it might have succeeded if a more standard policy process had been followed.
    


            Caldwell and Selnick, who have known Hegseth for years and worked with him at the conservative veterans organization Concerned Veterans for America, came to believe Kasper was isolating Hegseth and turning him against them, the sources said. Kasper, in turn, has told people he doesn't know where those accusations are coming from — it was Hegseth who launched the leak investigation that led to their firings, according to Kasper.
    


            Kasper said he had “nothing to do” with any of the decisions made when it came to the leak investigation. “I'm not even read in, nor was I involved in decisions,” he said.
    


            Kasper is no longer Hegseth's chief of staff, and is in the process of moving into a new position as a special government employee, according to the person familiar.
    


            “Joe's a great guy. He's a great American,” Hegseth said Tuesday during the interview on Fox News, adding, “He's staying with us, going to be in a slightly different role, but he's not going anywhere, certainly not fired.”
    


            Most senior officials inside the White House believe Hegseth has been the victim of what he termed “disgruntled former employees” who were fired in the past week for what Hegseth said were unauthorized leaks to the media.
    


            The former employees in question had been handpicked by Hegseth to serve on his leadership team, but he suggested in the Fox interview that his loyalty to them had run out.
    


            “It's not my job to protect them. It's my job to protect national security, the president of the United States, and let the investigation go where it is,” he said.
    


            “Disgruntled former employees are peddling things to try to save their a**,” Hegseth told Fox.
    


            Caldwell this week denied leaking information, and said he hadn't been questioned or polygraphed as part of any investigation.
    


            “I have been a friend and supporter of Pete Hegseth for a long time, and I'm just personally devastated by this. It's just awful,” he told Tucker Carlson on his podcast. “The entire Department of Defense cannot continue to be consumed by chaos.”
    


            In his own interview on Fox, Hegseth listed a number of recent stories he suggested came about due to leaks from his staff, including plans for a US takeover of the Panama Canal and a scheduled briefing for Musk on war plans against China.
    


            Hegseth suggested he wanted to keep those issues out of the media. But one of them — the report about plans to brief Musk — came as a surprise to Trump himself, who ordered the briefing for Musk be canceled. It's not clear whether the president would have learned of the planned briefing had it not appeared in the news.
    


            While Trump's aides think the Signal matter has been sufficiently resolved, some have said they still believe there could be more to emerge about Hegseth's leadership of the Defense Department that would prove embarrassing or worse.

            A delegation of congressional members traveled to Louisiana Tuesday to demand the release of Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk and inspect conditions at the two Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities where the two remain in custody.
    


            It's the first time a congressional delegation has met with Khalil or Ozturk.
    


            Khalil, a Columbia University graduate, and Ozturk, a Tufts University PhD student, have been in ICE custody for more than a month after being arrested near their homes by federal agents.
    


            The Democrat delegation, led by Rep. Troy Carter of Louisiana traveled to Jena, where Khalil is being held, and then two hours south to Basile, where Ozturk is detained. The group included Reps. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, Ayanna Pressley and Jim McGovern of Massachusetts and Sen. Ed Markey.
    


            The facilities were clean but “chilly” according to Carter, who said detainees complained of cold temperatures at night, making it difficult to sleep. Carter said the facilities appeared to have been cleaned prior to their visit and that conditions appeared to be “fine” while they visited.
    


            Following the visit, lawmakers said the detainees they met with also complained about a lack of medical care, food and religious accommodations.
    


            McGovern referred to Khalil and Ozturk as “political prisoners.”
    


            “I really worry that this administration is ushering in a new era of McCarthyism. And unless Congress and unless the American people stand up and push back, they will succeed,” McGovern said during a press conference after the visits.
    


            Markey accused the Trump administration of wanting to “make an example” out of Khalil and Ozturk in an effort to chill free speech. Markey also said ICE had intentionally transferred them to Louisiana for political reasons.
    


            Through the Trump administration, ICE feels “they have a right to take people from across our country, and to put them into facilities like this here in Louisiana,” Markey said. “And why did they do that? They have done that in order to go to the single most conservative Circuit Court of Appeals in the United States of America.”
    


            “Rümeysa Öztürk is my constituent, an accomplished scholar, and a valued member of our Massachusetts community. Like Rümeysa, Mahmoud Kahlil has committed no crime and is being punished by Donald Trump simply for exercising his right to free speech,” Pressley said in a statement to CNN prior to the visits.

            The Trump administration has accused Khalil of engaging in activities in support of Hamas following his high-profile participation in protests against the Israel-Hamas war on the campus of Columbia last year. It has also accused Ozturk of being a terrorist sympathizer after she co-wrote and published an op-ed in the university newspaper, which was critical of the school's response to the war last year.
    


            Neither Khalil or Ozturk has been charged with a crime.
    


            Both have sued the Trump administration in federal court and have filed multiple motions challenging the legality of their detentions.
    


            Khalil, a US permanent legal resident who is married to a US citizen, was detained in March. On Monday, his attorneys said ICE denied Khalil a special accommodation to attend the birth of his firstborn son.
    


            Ozturk, a Turkish national, has experienced multiple asthma attacks while in custody and has not had access to her medication, according to court documents and her attorneys. A federal judge in Vermont issued a decision last week ordering ICE to transfer her back from Louisiana to Vermont by May 1 while her case continues to play out.
    


            Tuesday's visit follows a series of recent trips by Washington lawmakers who have traveled to visit people who are in custody as a result of Trump's immigration crackdown.
    


            US Sen. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, met Monday with Mohsen Madawi, a prominent organizer of pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University who was detained during his final citizenship interview in Vermont last week.
    


            Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland traveled to El Salvador last week where he met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia. This week, four House Democrats also traveled to El Salvador seeking the release of Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident.

            The Trump administration appears open to negotiations with Harvard, even after America's most prestigious university sued the federal government – setting up a clash over academic freedom, federal funding and campus oversight.
    


            Last week, administration officials reached out to Harvard representatives three times in an effort to restart talks, a person familiar with the outreach told CNN. The nation's oldest university indicated it was not interested in negotiating, the person said.
    


            Two sources tell CNN all outreach attempts were informal.
    


            Barring a settlement, the legal showdown over frozen federal funds will likely take years to play out and could end up at the Supreme Court.
    


            At one point, before the filing of the lawsuit, Harvard President Alan Garber considered meeting with President Donald Trump, The New York Times reported Tuesday.
    


            A White House official told CNN, “The President is always willing to meet with leaders from across the nation on issues he is focused on.” However, the official added, “No meeting is under consideration at this time.”
    


            Some of the university's donors urged the institution's secretive board, the Harvard Corporation, to make a deal with the administration last week, something the corporation isn't currently interested in doing, The Times also reported.
    


            The administration intends to continue a dialogue with Harvard, said Education Secretary Linda McMahon, insisting the White House's recent demands are not about curbing freedom of speech.
    


            Harvard has emerged as a symbol of resistance against Trump, who has been trying to “reclaim” colleges and universities and has framed the conflict as a fight against antisemitism. The university says the White House is trying to control the Harvard community.
    


            The White House official compared conversations around federal funding for higher educational institutions to Trump's tariff policies – subject to negotiation. “President Trump is a results-driven president. … He truly wants to have a deal at the end of the day,” the official said.
    


            The Trump administration has already rolled back diversity, equity and inclusion programs, arrested international students and revoked their visas, and frozen federal funding for schools that refused to submit to its demands.
    


            Harvard said the administration has cut the funds to gain “leverage” over the university and the move is part of a “pressure campaign” to force the school to submit to governmental control, according to court documents.
    


            The government's actions “threaten Harvard's academic independence” and “are part of a broader effort by the Government to punish Harvard for protecting its constitutional rights,” Harvard's lawyers wrote.

Harvard's fight with the Trump administration is just getting started. The cost is already high



            The new Harvard lawsuit argues the Trump administration has failed to establish any tie between the crucial funding cuts and fighting antisemitism.
    


            “The Government has not – and cannot – identify any rational connection between antisemitism concerns and the medical, scientific, technological, and other research it has frozen that aims to save American lives, foster American success, preserve American security, and maintain America's position as a global leader in innovation,” said the lawsuit, filed in Boston federal court.
    


            The case has been assigned to US District Court Judge Allison Burroughs, an Obama nominee who was involved in a previous landmark case involving the university. Burroughs, who did not earn her bachelor's or law degree from Harvard, upheld Harvard's admissions process in a 2019 ruling that was overturned by the Supreme Court's landmark decision ending race-conscious admissions in American colleges.
    


            Harvard's suit against the Trump administration comes as prominent Jewish organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League and Harvard's chapter of the Hillel student organization, have publicly questioned the administration's broad attacks on the university.
    


            “(S)huttering apolitical, life-saving research; targeting the university's tax-exempt status; and threatening all student visas … is neither focused nor measured, and stands to substantially harm the very Jewish students and scholars it purports to protect,” Harvard Hillel wrote Saturday.
    


            The escalation between Harvard and the Trump administration intensified quickly, according to court documents.
    


            In March, the federal government sent a letter to Harvard saying the school was being investigated for its failures to “curb or combat” antisemitism on campus. A similar letter with demands for policy changes had been sent to Columbia University, and federal agencies soon announced a review of more than $5 billion in grants to the Ivy League school.
    


            Antisemitic incidents on college campuses increased by 84% between 2023 and 2024, accounting for 18% of all incidents, an annual audit from the Anti-Defamation League said Tuesday. Some occurred during protests between mid-April and mid-May 2024 in response to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.
    


            Columbia later announced several changes to address the Trump administration's demands, an apparent concession to the federal government.
    


            The White House continued targeting universities — Princeton, Cornell and Northwestern all had funds frozen or suspended — and on April 11 sent Harvard a list of policy changes it wanted implemented, demanding “immediate cooperation” if the university wanted to “maintain Harvard's financial relationship with the federal government.”
    


            The list included eliminating the school's diversity, equity and inclusion programs, banning masks at campus protests, merit-based hiring and admissions reforms and reducing the power held by faculty and administrators “more committed to activism than scholarship.”

            A New York Times report suggested the letter inadvertently had been sent prematurely. Still, Harvard put out a response three days later, publicly rebuking the Trump administration, saying it would not “surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”
    


            The Trump administration retaliated by freezing $2.2 billion in multiyear grants and contracts, making plans to rescind Harvard's tax-exempt status and threatening the school's ability to host international students.
    


            The school sued days later.
    


            If the case were to end up at the Supreme Court, it would be heard by a bench that includes four Harvard alumni: liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, along with Justice Neil Gorsuch and Chief Justice John Roberts, both conservatives.
    


            Justices are unlikely to recuse themselves from a case based solely on having studied at an institution involved. Jackson recused herself from a case involving affirmative action at Harvard because she was on the school's board of overseers; the other three Harvard alumni ruled in that groundbreaking case.
    


            “I think Harvard, for now, is insisting on treatment that's consistent with law,” former US Treasury Secretary and former Harvard University President Larry Summers told CNN's Kaitlan Collins Tuesday. “It seems to me plain to anybody who reads the statute that … the Trump administration is in massive violation of the law.
    


            Billions of dollars, along with jobs, research and Harvard's ability to administer financial aid are not the only things at stake. The “standing of American higher education” is also on the table, Harvard President Garber said Monday in a statement.
    


            Garber signed a letter with more than 100 presidents of colleges, universities and scholarly societies, opposing the Trump administration's pressure on academic institutions.

            “As leaders of America's colleges, universities, and scholarly societies, we speak with one voice against the unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American higher education,” said the letter released Tuesday by the American Association of Colleges and Universities.
    


            “We are open to constructive reform and do not oppose legitimate government oversight. However, we must oppose undue government intrusion in the lives of those who learn, live, and work on our campuses,” wrote the presidents – including leaders of Princeton and American universities – adding, “The price of abridging the defining freedoms of American higher education will be paid by our students and our society.”
    


            McMahon, the education secretary, reitereted the adminstration's stance.
    


            “I made it very clear that these are not First Amendment infractions. This is civil rights. This is making sure that students on all campuses can come and learn and be safe … and that is why we have had these funds either withheld or frozen during this period of time of negotiation,” she said on CNBC's “Squawk Box.”

            McMahon did not respond directly to a question about whether the Trump administration's demand in its April 11 letter for “viewpoint diversity” among Harvard students, faculty and departments, to be audited by a third party, is really about free speech.
    


            “We had hoped Harvard would come back to the table to discuss these. We would like to have viewpoint diversity,” the education secretary replied. The letter, she added, “was intended to have both parties sit down again and continue their negotiations.”
    


            The White House official who discussed conversations about funding cast the response from Harvard as “grandstanding” and “political antics” that “set back the good faith negotiations on our part.”
    


            It is the White House's hope, this official said, that Harvard “comes to the table and corrects course.”
    


            “Money speaks and when money is getting dried up because their donors aren't buying into what they're selling anymore and the federal government isn't there to pad their pockets, they want to remain the envy of the world when it comes to research and science and academia – and they can only do that if they work with this administration,” the official said.
    


            The ultimate goal, the official said, is to “end antisemitism, end discrimination, end inequality” with the hope of “universities that don't take advantage of the American people and don't bloat systems to overpay professors that look down on the American people.”
    


            “This is an easy thing to resolve if the other side wants to play ball,” the official said, pointing to agreements made between the Trump administration and some law firms it has targeted.
    


            Garber said last week the demands in the letter were “unprecedented” and made “to control the Harvard community,” adding that the university “will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”
    


            One of Harvard's best-known educators, constitutional law professor emeritus Laurence Tribe, said he believes the university's decision to take the administration to court will give courage to other embattled institutions.
    


            “I think that Harvard is encouraging many others to stand up, because when we win – and we will – they will realize that going along with dictatorial demands doesn't get them anywhere,” Tribe told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday.
    


            Harvard, the world's wealthiest university, has an endowment of $53 billion, which could help cushion cuts. About 80% of that money is earmarked for financial aid, scholarships, faculty chairs, academic programs or other projects, according to the school. The remaining 20% is intended to sustain the institution's future.
    


            But the lawsuit paints a bleak picture of that future if Harvard has to dip into university coffers for too long. Eventually, Harvard will be left operating at “a significantly reduced level,” the complaint says.
    


            “If Harvard continues to replace the frozen funding from its own resources, it will be forced to reduce the number of graduate students it admits and the number of faculty and research staff it pays to conduct research,” the lawsuit says.
    


            The Trump administration's threats against Harvard's tax-exempt status and its ability to host international students could put even more pressure on the university's funding, and more federal money could get withheld.
    


            The National Institutes of Health announced Monday it would pull medical research funding from universities with diversity and inclusion programs. Of the $686 million in Harvard's federal research funding in fiscal year 2024, $488 million came from NIH, according to the Harvard Crimson.
    


            The government is “slamming on the brakes” on research and the “victims will be future patients,” Garber said. Research on childhood cancer, infectious disease outbreaks and how to ease the pain of soldiers wounded on the battlefield would all be affected, Garber added.
    


            The indiscriminate cuts, he said, would undermine America's position as a global leader in innovation, adding, “The consequences of the government's overreach will be severe and long-lasting.”
    


            Harvard's many partnerships with other universities, private companies, and state and local agencies mean the freeze on funding will touch off widespread economic harm, the lawsuit argues, noting, “Harvard is one of Massachusetts' largest employers.”
    


            “The freeze creates a ripple effect extending beyond Harvard's campus by stifling job creation in the research sector across the nation, reducing intellectual property development, and delaying scientific and medical advances that boost the national economy,” the lawsuit says.

Five years after Harvey Weinstein's original #MeToo trial delivered a searing reckoning for one of Hollywood's most powerful figures, the ex-studio boss is on trial again after an appeals court threw out his landmark rape conviction.

NEW YORK (AP) — Opening statements in Harvey Weinstein 's #MeToo rape retrial began Wednesday with a prosecutor telling jurors about the three allegations at issue in the case, including one involving a woman who wasn't part of the original trial in 2020. Weinstein's lawyer countered that the women and the one-time Hollywood powerbroker had consensual relationships.

Kaja Sokola, a former model from Poland, alleges that Weinstein pinned her to a bed and forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006 after luring her to his Manhattan hotel room with the promise of movie scripts. Four years earlier, Sokola alleges, he molested her at his apartment when she was just 16, Assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey told jurors.

Weinstein, 73, is charged in connection with the 2006 allegation, but not the earlier one. Sokola previously sued and received $3.5 million in compensation, Lucey said.

It's the first time Manhattan prosecutors have detailed Sokola's allegations, which were added to the case after New York's highest court overturned Weinstein's conviction last year. The rest of the retrial involves allegations from two women who were part of the original trial — Miriam Haley and Jessica Mann.

The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley, Mann and Sokola have done.

Emphasizing Weinstein's onetime influence in the movie industry, Lucey said the ex-studio boss used “dream opportunities as weapons” to prey on women. He is charged with raping Mann and forcing oral sex on Haley and Sokola. 




“The defendant wanted their bodies, and the more they resisted, the more forceful he got,” Lucey said.

Weinstein, she said, “held the golden ticket: a chance to make it, or not.”

The Oscar-winning producer, seated in the wheelchair he now uses because of health problems, whispered with one of his lawyers and appeared to take notes as Lucey described his alleged crimes, but he didn't look at the jury. 

Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone.

His lawyer, Arthur Aidala, told jurors in his opening statement that Weinstein engaged in “mutually beneficial relationships” with women who wanted his help in the industry but that nothing he did was illegal.

“In this case, the casting couch is not a crime scene,” Aidala argued.

He implored jurors to view the case with an open mind and to wait until they've heard all of the evidence before reaching a conclusion. Acknowledging Weinstein's former career, Aidala compared the opening stage of the trial to a movie trailer.

“How often is a preview great, but the movie falls flat on its face?” the defense lawyer said. “After you hear all of the evidence, their case is going to fall flat on its face.”

The audience in the packed courtroom included Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. He inherited the landmark #MeToo case, brought by his predecessor, when the Court of Appeals last year threw out the 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence because the judge allowed testimony about allegations Weinstein was not charged with. The reversal led to the retrial. 

Weinstein's retrial is playing out at a different cultural moment than the first. #MeToo, which exploded in 2017 with allegations against Weinstein, has evolved and ebbed.

The jury counts seven women and five men — unlike the seven-man, five-woman panel that convicted him in 2020 — and there's a different judge.

At the start of Weinstein's first trial, chants of “rapist” could be heard from protesters outside. This time, there was none of that. 

Weinstein is being retried on a criminal sex act charge for allegedly forcibly performing oral sex on Haley, a movie and TV production assistant at the time, in 2006, and a third-degree rape charge for allegedly assaulting Mann, a then-aspiring actor, in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.

Weinstein also faces a criminal sex act charge for allegedly forcing oral sex on Sokola, also in 2006. Prosecutors said she came forward days before his first trial but wasn't part of that case. They said they revisited her allegations when his conviction was thrown out.

Weinstein's acquittals on the two most serious charges at his 2020 trial — predatory sexual assault and first-degree rape — still stand.

Sokola's lawyer, Lindsay Goldbrum, said Weinstein's retrial marks a “pivotal moment in the fight for accountability in sex abuse cases” and a “signal to other survivors that the system is catching up — and that it's worth speaking out even when the odds seem insurmountable.”

During jury selection, a prosecutor asked prospective jurors whether they'd heard of the #MeToo movement. Most said they had, but that it wouldn't affect them either way. 

Those who indicated it might were excused.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro claims President Donald Trump's administration has revoked his travel visa to the U.S. this week.

Petro made the announcement at a cabinet meeting, responding to questions about whether he would attend meetings with international organizations in Washington, D.C. later this year.

""I can no longer go because I believe they took away my visa,"" Petro told reporters.

""I didn't need to have one, but anyway, I've already seen Donald Duck several times, so I'll go see other things,"" Petro added.

The State Department has refused to comment on the topic due to the confidentiality of visa records, according to the New York Post.

Petro's claim comes months after he caved to Trump after initially refusing to accept deportation flights from the U.S. military.

Noem said that she had a ""candid"" conversation with Sarabia, and the pair later jointly announced a data-sharing agreement that would help U.S. authorities identify illegal immigrants.

""We're going to strengthen our regional security systems and make sure that we're disrupting the movement of threatening actors that perpetuate illegal activity and also facilitate illegal trafficking of migrants across the Western Hemisphere,"" Noem said at the time.

""Through this expansion of sharing of biometric data, it will be much more efficient, effective, accurate, and it will also build cooperation that will open doors to new ways that we can continue to work together,"" she added.

Michel Picaud, president of Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris, shares updates on the restoration of the Notre Dame Cathedral in France five years after a fire shut the site down.

Many travelers to Istanbul, Turkey, may find themselves at one of the most beautiful sacred places in the world: the Hagia Sophia.

The ancient temple attracts scores of visitors from the West. It's known for its history as a Christian basilica for almost 1,000 years before becoming a mosque during the Ottoman Empire.

Officials are now working to preserve the historic domes of the monument — built between 532 and 537 AD — from the threat of earthquakes.

POPULAR CHURCH WILL CURB TOURIST CROWDS BY CREATING SEPARATE 'SELFIE SPACE'

The renovation will reinforce the Hagia Sophia's main dome and half domes, replacing the worn lead coverings and upgrading the steel framework, The Associated Press (AP) reported.

In 1935, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founder of the modern Republic of Turkey, transformed Hagia Sophia into a museum.

Mehmet Selim Okten, construction engineer and member of the scientific council overseeing the renovations, told AP a ""new phase"" of construction is about to begin.

""At the end of these three years, we have focused on the seismic safety of Hagia Sophia, the minarets, the main dome and the main arches, especially due to the expected Istanbul earthquake,"" said Okten.

The renovation comes after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Turkey in 2023, destroying hundreds of buildings.

Orkten said construction workers will be able to renovate more safely and ""examine the building's layers academically, including damage it suffered from fires and earthquakes in the 10th and 14th centuries,"" according to AP.

""A tower crane will be installed on the eastern facade, and then we will cover the top of this unique structure with a protective frame system,"" he said. 

The Hagia Sophia receives an average of around 50,000 visitors daily and approximately 6-7 million annually, according to Istanbul Deputy Akturkoglu.

Montgomery County Mom Grace Morrison joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss her ongoing legal battle over the lack of opt-out for LGBTQ+ curriculum in schools. 

The University of Louisville has reportedly agreed to pay nearly $1.6 million to settle a lawsuit brought by a former professor who was fired for criticizing transgender treatments for children experiencing gender dysphoria.

Dr. Allan Josephson worked for nearly 15 years as chief of the University of Louisville's Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychology. According to his legal complaint, Josephson was able to turn around the struggling division during his tenure and received perfect scores in his 2014-2016 annual reviews.

Despite his professional accomplishments, the complaint alleges that Josephson was demoted in 2017 and eventually fired after making comments in his own capacity challenging the push to use hormone therapy and surgery for children with gender dysphoria, according to legal group Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF).

ADF, which represented Josephson in court, announced the settlement agreement Monday and hailed the case as a ""major victory"" for free speech.

""I'm glad to finally receive vindication for voicing what I know is true,"" Josephson also said in a statement. ""Children deserve better than life-altering procedures that mutilate their bodies and destroy their ability to lead fulfilling lives. In spite of the circumstances I suffered through with my university, I'm overwhelmed to see that my case helped lead the way for other medical practitioners to see the universal truth that altering biological sex is impossibly dangerous while acceptance of one's sex leads to flourishing.""

According to the complaint, the saga began in October 2017 when Josephson participated in a panel discussion on transgender ideology hosted by the conservative organization, The Heritage Foundation, in which he spoke out against gender ideology activism influencing the medical treatment of children experiencing gender dysphoria. 

Upon learning of Josephson's remarks, officials at the university's LGBT center reportedly pressured his division to take disciplinary action against him.

Scrutiny of his views intensified after he appeared as an expert witness in a legal case involving a school district's bathroom policy around gender identity.

NORTH CAROLINA PROFESSOR WHO WAGED ‘WAR ON DEI' AT UNIVERSITY TOUTS WIN

A few of Josephson's colleagues who objected to his remarks pushed for the administration to take disciplinary action against him, the complaint says. The next month, Josephson was informed by the university that he was being demoted from chief of the division to a junior faculty member.

According to the complaint, university officials continued to ""belittle and berate him,"" inflicting ""irreparable damage to his professional career and reputation,"" and reduced his salary and benefits, before he was told in February 2019 that his contract would not be renewed, effectively firing him.

Josephson challenged his firing in a lawsuit against the university filed the following month. He alleged the school ""retaliated"" against him for expressing his views, in violation of his First Amendment rights and right to due process and equal protection under the law.

With the six-year legal battle resulting in a favorable settlement, Alliance Defending Freedom filed a stipulated dismissal of the case Monday, court records show.

""Hopefully, other public universities will learn from this that if they violate the First Amendment, they can be held accountable, and it can be very expensive,"" ADF Senior Counsel Travis Barham said.

‘Fox News @ Night' panelists Brandon Straka and Natalie Beisner discuss Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's daughter receiving backlash for her comments about Jesus and immigration and the Democratic Party's messaging.

Fewer than one in three young Americans approve of the job President Donald Trump and Congress are doing, according to a new national poll from the Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics.

But while the approval ratings for Trump and congressional Republicans have mostly stayed consistent since the start of the president's first administration eight years ago, the 50th Harvard Youth Poll indicates that approval ratings for Democrats in Congress among Americans aged 18-29 have nosedived.

According to Harvard's annual spring survey, which was conducted March 14-25 and released on Wednesday, the approval rating for congressional Democrats stands at 23%, down from 42% in the spring of 2017 at the start of Trump's first term.

""In that same period, approval of Congressional Republicans has held steady, inching up slightly from 28% to 29%,"" the poll's release notes.

And the approval rating for Trump, who next week marks 100 days into his second tour of duty in the White House, stands at 31% in the new survey. 

AMERICANS WEIGH IN ON TRUMP'S TEASING OF A THIRD TERM

The release highlights that Trump's numbers are ""virtually unchanged from the 32% reported in Spring 2017 and the 29% recorded in Fall 2020.""

Harvard's survey is the latest to indicate troubling numbers for the Democrats. 

The confidence rating for Democrat leadership in Congress stood at a record-low 25% in a Gallup poll conducted April 1-14 and released last week. That's nine points below the previous low of 34%, which was recorded in 2023.

Fueling the drop in confidence in the Democrat congressional leadership was a 41-point plunge among Democrats questioned in the Gallup survey.

DEMOCRATS FAVORABLE RATINGS DROP TO RECORD LOWS

National polls conducted in February by Quinnipiac University, and last month by CNN and by NBC News, indicated the favorable ratings for the Democratic Party sinking to all-time lows.

The Democratic Party is in the political wilderness after November's election setbacks, when Republicans won back control of the White House and the Senate and defended their fragile House majority. And Republicans made gains among Black and Hispanic voters as well as younger voters, all traditional members of the Democratic Party's base.

Democrats have become increasingly angry and energized in response to Trump's aggressive and controversial moves in slashing the federal government and upending long-standing national since returning to the White House three months ago.

That anger is directed not only at Trump and Republicans but also at Democrats. Many in the party's base feel their leaders in Congress haven't been effective or vocal enough in pushing back against the president.

According to the Harvard poll, only 15% say the country is headed in the right direction, with just over half (51%) saying the country's on the wrong track. 

And just one in four surveyed said the current state of the country is better now under Trump than it was during former President Joe Biden's single four-year term in the White House.

Forty-one percent said things were better off under Biden, with 14% saying they see no difference and 17% unsure.

XX-XY Athletics founder Jennifer Sey on Washington State failing to pass proposals to protect girls' sports and a report that former President Joe Biden secretly believed that trans athletes shouldn't compete alongside women.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison announced a lawsuit against the Trump administration and Department of Justice on Tuesday to ensure that states can continue letting biologically male trans athletes play in girls' sports. 

The White House has responded to the lawsuit, condemning Ellison for taking legal action to enable trans inclusion. 

""Why would a grown man sue the Trump administration to allow other biological males to participate in women's sports? This is creepy and anti-woman,"" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields told Fox News Digital. 

Ellison made the announcement at a press conference after months of the state defying Trump's ""Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"" executive order. Ellison claimed he had received notice from the Department of Justice threatening legal action if the state did not follow the executive order. 

""I'm not going to sit around waiting for the Trump administration to sue Minnesota. Today, Minnesota is suing him and his administration because we will not participate in this shameful bullying,"" Ellison said. ""We will not let a small group of vulnerable children who are only trying be healthy and live their lives be demonized.""

Ellison's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis, argues that the Trump administration does not have the authority to set states' athletic gender eligibility policies through an executive order.

Minnesota is the first state to sue the Department of Justice over threats to cut funding for letting trans athletes play in girls' sports, and the second state to sue the Trump administration over the issue. 

Maine has filed a lawsuit against Trump after the Department of Agriculture cut funding to the state on April 2, and a federal judge has already ruled the USDA must unfreeze the funding. 

The Justice Department filed a lawsuit against the state for its ongoing defiance of Trump's ""Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"" executive order. Maine has faced federal pressure in the last two months over its refusal to comply, including two federal investigations, a funding freeze and now a lawsuit. 

When Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the lawsuit against Maine at a press conference last week, she said Minnesota and California could be next. 

""We're looking at Minnesota. We're looking at California. We're looking at many, many states but they are the top two that should be on notice because we've been communicating with them,"" Bondi said.

After Trump's executive order, the Minnesota State High School League announced it would defy federal law by allowing transgender athletes to continue playing in women's sports.

Ellison's office stated that ""based on the plain language of the statute, educational institutions and the Minnesota State High School League would violate the MHRA by prohibiting transgender athletes from participating in extracurricular activities consistent with their gender identity.""

HOW TRANSGENDERISM IN SPORTS SHIFTED THE 2024 ELECTION AND IGNITED A NATIONAL COUNTERCULTURE

Minnesota's state legislature failed to pass the ""Preserving Girls' Sports Act"" in early March, which would have stated that ""only female students may participate in an elementary or secondary school level athletic team or sport that an educational institution has restricted to women and girls.""

The bill fell short in the state's House of Representatives, with 67 of the 68 votes needed to pass. Gov. Tim Walz was expected to veto the bill had it gone to his desk.

Former Minnesota Vikings and University of Minnesota football player Jack Brewer lobbied for the bill, and had told Fox News Digital he found Walz's pro-trans stances ""disgusting,"" especially considering Walz was a football coach at Mankato West High School in the 1990s. 

""It's absolutely disgusting, and it's why, when you see him and you see his mannerisms and the way he carries himself, you know this guy doesn't appeal to real men and boys who have battled it out on the gridiron, man. I have nothing in common with this guy,"" Brewer said. 

""I think he's a disgrace to the football world to be honest.""

A New York Times/Ipsos survey found the vast majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, don't think transgender athletes should be permitted to compete in women's sports. 

Of the 2,128 people who participated, 79% said biological males who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports. Of the 1,025 people who identified as Democrats or leaning Democratic, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete with women.

XX-XY Athletics founder Jennifer Sey on Washington State failing to pass proposals to protect girls' sports and a report that former President Joe Biden secretly believed that trans athletes shouldn't compete alongside women.

EXCLUSIVE: Rep. Mary Miller, R-Ill., called on President Donald Trump's administration to take action against her state. 

In a letter obtained by Fox News Digital addressed to the Departments of Education and Justice, Miller pleaded for the agencies to investigate after the Illinois High School Association (IHSA) said it would continue allowing trans athletes to compete in girls' sports. 

""I am writing to express my deep concern regarding a recent decision by the Illinois High School Association (IHSA), which has chosen to blatantly disregard federal law and reject basic biological reality by allowing biological males to compete in girls' athletic programs. This misguided policy not only undermines the integrity and fairness of girls' sports, but it also jeopardizes the safety of young women across our state,"" Miller wrote. 

""I respectfully urge the Department of Justice and the Department of Education to investigate the actions of IHSA and the State of Illinois and take appropriate measures to ensure that federal civil rights protections are upheld."" 

TEEN GIRLS OPEN UP ON TRANS ATHLETE SCANDAL THAT TURNED THEIR HIGH SCHOOL INTO A CULTURE WAR BATTLEGROUND 

Miller provided a statement to Fox News Digital addressing the letter, and condemning Gov. J.B. Pritzker. 

""I'm calling on Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary Linda McMahon to launch an immediate investigation into the IHSA and the State of Illinois. Gov. J.B. Pritzker and radical Illinois Democrats must be held accountable for enforcing abusive, anti-science gender policies ahead of the safety of our daughters and the fairness of girls' sports,"" Miller said. 

Transgender athletes have been permitted to compete in girls' sports in Illinois since 2011.

Illinois became one of the many blue states to openly defy Trump's ""Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"" executive order after it was signed on Feb. 5. 

In a public letter to state GOP lawmakers last week, the IHSA said Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and the Illinois Department of Human Rights have declared that state law requires that transgender athletes be allowed to participate based on gender identity. The IHSA cited the state's human rights laws as a barrier to banning biological males from girls' sports. 

That letter came in response to GOP lawmakers sending their own letter to the IHSA in March asking what the body would do to change policy after Trump's executive order passed.

""The Illinois High School Association has crossed a dangerous line. By blatantly violating federal law and rejecting biological reality, they are not only undermining fairness in girls' sports – they're putting the safety of young women at risk,"" Miller told Fox News Digital. 

A federal Title IX investigation is already underway in Illinois after a Deerfield mother alleged her daughter was forced to change in front of a trans student. Deerfield Public Schools District 109 is facing a probe by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights after Illinois mother Nicole Georgas brought light to the situation. 

Georgas has now told Fox News Digital she is also worried about her daughter's athletic future because of the IHSA's ruling. 

""Imagine your daughter, dedicating her life, training for years, hours and hours a week, for her championship state race, only to face a male beating her and winning that coveted scholarship. How is that at all fair? Our daughter's dedication to athletics is slowly being erased,"" Georgas said. 

Deerfield Public Schools District 109 responded to the investigation in a statement to Fox News Digital and, like the IHSA, cited the Illinois Human Rights Act for its protocols. 

""Deerfield Public Schools District 109 complies with state law. The Illinois Human Rights Act prohibits all public school districts from discriminating on the basis of sex, including gender identity, and mandates that students must be permitted access to the locker room and bathroom that aligns with their gender identity,"" the statement said.

Meanwhile, Maine has already seen the type of intervention that Miller is calling for.

That state has seen its federal funding cut by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Justice has launched a lawsuit against it for continued defiance of Trump's order. Maine has launched its own lawsuit against the Trump administration over the funding freeze, and a federal judge has ruled it be unfrozen. 

A New York Times/Ipsos survey found the vast majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, don't think transgender athletes should be permitted to compete in women's sports. 

Of the 2,128 people who participated, 79% said biological males who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports. Of the 1,025 people who identified as Democrats or leaning Democratic, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete with women.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Treasury Secretary Bessent says trade war with China will deescalate soon","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/finance-and-economy/3388265/treasury-secretary-scott-bessent-trade-war-china-deescalate-soon/","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 00:06:49 GMT","

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent believes the United States's trade war with China will wind down soon.

Bessent gave the remarks in a private speech in Washington, D.C., for JPMorgan Chase, adding that the conflict is not “sustainable.”

“I do say China is going to be a slog in terms of the negotiations,” Bessent said, according to a transcript of his remarks obtained by the Associated Press. “Neither side thinks the status quo is sustainable.” 

However, he mentioned two to three years as the likely timeframe where a comprehensive deal between the countries would be struck, according to sources speaking with Bloomberg who attended the event. The current situation is essentially a trade embargo, Bessent suggested.

China and the U.S. have enforced massive tariffs on goods entering their borders from the opposing country. China put a 125% tariff on U.S. products, while the U.S. has a 145% tariff on Chinese goods.

President Donald Trump and his administration are negotiating with several countries/unions on deals regarding the tariffs, including Japan, South Korea, the European Union, and others.

Trump said the U.S. was “doing fine” with China when asked about Bessent's comments, adding that he did not anticipate a “hardball” negotiation. He added that he'd be “very good to China” and that he doubts the final tariff will be close to 145%.

“We're going to be very nice,” Trump said. “They're going to be very nice, and we'll see what happens. But ultimately, they have to make a deal, because otherwise they're not going to be able to deal in the United States.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump also told her that the U.S. was “doing very well in respect to a potential trade deal with China.” She added that 18 different nations had brought trade offers to the White House and the president's trade team was meeting with 34 countries this week about possible agreements.

Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) will not run for a sixth term in the Senate, clearing the way for a younger crop of Democrats to compete for his seat.

Durbin, 80, announced Wednesday that he will retire from the Senate in 2026. The decision had been expected, with the senator raising a paltry $43,000 in the first quarter. But his announcement means Democrats who were previously mounting a shadow primary can now run openly for one of Illinois's two Senate seats.

It also opens the door to a rare leadership shake-up in the Senate, in which Durbin is the longest-serving party whip after two decades in the role.

“The decision of whether to run for re-election has not been easy. I truly love the job of being a United States Senator. But in my heart, I know it's time to pass the torch,” Durbin said in a statement on X. “So, I am announcing today that I will not be seeking re-election at the end of my term.”

The seat is rated safe for Democrats by nonpartisan election forecasters. More significantly, Durbin's retirement will reshuffle the chamber's leadership roster, where Durbin and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) have led as the top two Democrats since President Donald Trump first came to power in 2017.

Durbin also serves as the lead Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, creating another opportunity for a colleague to rise up the ranks. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) is the next most senior Democrat on the panel.

A wave of Illinois Democrats could mount a bid to replace him as they seek to capitalize on what could be a once-in-a-generation open primary. Those names include state Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton and Reps. Lauren Underwood (D-IL), Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), and Robin Kelly (D-IL).

It's unclear whether Durbin would get involved in what could become a messy primary. His retirement announcement suggested he may remain neutral. 

“We're also fortunate to have a strong Democratic bench ready to serve,” Durbin said. “We need them now more than ever.”

Durbin's anemic first-quarter fundraising in the lead-up to his decision stood in stark contrast to the war chests already at the disposal of would-be contenders to fill the seat.

Krishnamoorthi raised $3 million in the first three months of the year, giving him $19 million cash on hand that could be used for a Senate run. Stratton has signaled that, should she enter the race, she would receive financial backing from billionaire Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL) of the Hyatt hotel empire.

ILLINOIS DEMOCRATS WAIT IN THE WINGS FOR DURBIN 2026 ANNOUNCEMENT

Durbin has served in Congress for more than 40 years, since 1983, when he began as a congressman, until his election to the Senate in 1996. He made no explicit mention of Trump or Republicans in his retirement message but made clear the stakes he believes are at play in American politics.

“The threats to our democracy and way of life are very real,” he said. “And I can assure you, I'll do everything in my power to fight for Illinois and the future of our country every day of my remaining time in the Senate.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Former Republican vice presidential candidate and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin lost her defamation retrial against the New York Times.

A New York City jury rejected Palin's claim that the newspaper defamed her in a 2017 opinion piece in which the publication insinuated that the former politician was responsible for inciting political violence in the country, specifically linking Palin to the shooting of former Democratic congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in 2011. 

It was Palin's second defeat in her attempt to hold the publication accountable for what she claimed was defamation. She lost the first trial in 2022 after a jury found the New York Times wasn't liable for defaming the former Alaska governor.

The original case stemmed from a New York Times editorial that was published shortly after the 2017 shooting of Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) and the attempted assassination of congressional Republicans and staffers at a baseball field in Washington, D.C. The New York Times article linked that incident to the attack on Giffords six years earlier by claiming that Palin's political action committee “circulated a map that showed the targeted electoral districts of Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs.” Palin's lawsuit rebutted this assertion and said the article's description was incorrect. 

The New York Times corrected the article 14 hours after it was published, adding a sentence after the accusation about crosshairs: “But in that case, no connection to the shooting was ever established.” 

Palin's lawsuit claimed that “the Times conduct was committed knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly and maliciously, with the intent to harm Mrs. Palin, or in blatant disregard of the substantial likelihood of causing her harm, thereby entitling Mrs. Palin to an award of punitive damages.”

The New York Times issued a statement after the trial thanking the jury for its work.

“We want to thank the jurors for their careful deliberations. The decision reaffirms an important tenet of American law: publishers are not liable for honest mistakes,” a spokesperson from the New York Times said.

Palin posted a video on social media after the jury's verdict, showing her leaving the court and entering an SUV. Above the video, the text said she gets to “go home” and return to “the best 5 kids a mom could ever hope for & a quiver full of perfect grandbabies.” The same post also included a message about the trial's outcome.

“Be not afraid.” When Pope John Paul II uttered those words in 1979, they resonated far beyond his native Warsaw, Poland. His proclamation was not simply spiritual guidance, but a principled stance against Soviet tyranny. John Paul II gave voice to the oppressed and reminded us why moral clarity matters.

Sadly, that clarity was sometimes hard to find in the papacy of Pope Francis. Francis died Monday, aged 88.

Since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Francis's responses caused outrage in Ukraine and beyond. Throughout the war, Francis consistently refused to name Russia or its president, Vladimir Putin, as the aggressor. In March 2024, he went so far as to suggest that Ukraine should have the “courage of the white flag” and negotiate. Even the Polish President Andrzej Duda, with his very Catholic electorate, called the pope's remarks “unfortunate.”

Why was Francis a sympathizer with Putin's aggression?

Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Pope Francis was shaped by the country's Peronist era. As a Jesuit in the 1970s, he was linked to the Guardia de Hierro, a group supporting President Juan Perón's return from exile — an early signal of his affinity for Peronist ideas marked by populism, dislike of the United States, and skepticism toward capitalism. In spirit, Peronism preached social justice and empowerment. In practice, it descended into authoritarianism, censorship, and political repression. In Argentina, Francis was widely viewed as Peronist, and although he denied it in a 2023 book, he added, “If we had a Peronist conception of politics, what would be wrong with that?”

As my friend Shadi Hamid put it, Pope Francis was a revolutionary, but not in the spirit of John Paul II. His struggle wasn't against authoritarianism, but against what he saw as Western cultural and political overreach. “The duty of Christianity for Europe,” he said, “is the service. And not colonization.” For Francis, it was always an unjust Western dominance, not Russian or Chinese imperialism, that demanded scrutiny. In doing so, Francis drew false moral equivalence between Western democracies and authoritarian regimes. And nowhere was this clearer than in the Pope's comments on Ukraine.

In a 2022 interview, Francis tried to remove responsibility from Russia over its brutal war. He referred to NATO as “barking at the gates of Russia” and suggested Russia was “perhaps somehow provoked”. He warned against casting the conflict as a fairytale battle of “good guys vs. bad guys” and said it was “hypocritical” to arm Ukraine.

Comments in August 2023 caused further anger. Speaking to young Russian Catholics via video, the pope said, “You are the heirs of great Russia. Great Russia of the saints, of large Russia of Peter I, of Catherine II, of that empire. Great, enlightened, of big culture and big humanity. Never reject that heritage. … You are heirs of great Mother Russia. Go forward with it. … Thank you for your way to exist, for your way to be Russian.” Many Ukrainians listened to these comments and saw the pope equating the aggressor with the victim.

It didn't end there. The world's most powerful spiritual leader condemned Ukraine's decision to restrict the Russian Orthodox Church, despite its well-established links to the Russian intelligence services. Yet, he also remained silent when Russian occupation authorities banned Greek Catholic churches, expelled clergy, and shut down charities on fabricated espionage charges. The Vatican also said nothing about the intimidation of evangelical Christians in Russian-occupied territories.

The pope's moral blind spot wasn't limited to Ukraine. He never condemned Beijing's mass repression of Uyghur Muslims or of China's underground Catholic Church. Imperialism, in Francis's view, seemed to run only from West to East. If zoomed out, one can see this man as a standard Latin American leftist. That would be okay, if only he hadn't been the leader of a church that is a touchstone for Western civilization.

PUTIN CLAIMS HE'S OPEN TO DIRECT TALKS WITH UKRAINE

True, this is not the full story of the pontiff's reign. His defenders cite his humanitarian work, his calls for peace, and his support for the everyday man. They underline his attempts to aid prisoner exchanges amid war and to facilitate the return of Ukrainian children forcibly relocated to Russia. His rhetorical reservations, supporters say, served his diplomacy.

But while those efforts were real, overly balanced statements on matters of grave moral consequence are not ultimately balanced — they are biased. On matters such as the war in Ukraine and the Uyghur genocide, to avoid taking a side is to take the wrong one.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Reality is catching up with Elon Musk.

It's a rare thing to shoot yourself in the foot and win a marathon. For years, Elon Musk has managed to do something like that with Tesla, achieving monumental success in spite of a series of self-inflicted disasters. There was the time he heavily promoted the company's automated factory, only to later admit that its “crazy, complex network of conveyor belts” had thrown production of the Model 3 off track; and the time a tweet led him to be sued for fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission; and the time he said that the Tesla team had “dug our own grave” with the massively delayed and overhyped Cybertruck. Tesla is nonetheless the most valuable car company in the world by a wide margin.



But luck runs out. Yesterday evening, Tesla reported first-quarter earnings for 2025, and they were abysmal: Profits dropped 71 percent from the same time last year. Musk sounded bitter on the call with investors that followed, blaming the company's misfortune on protesters who have raged at Tesla dealerships around the world over his role running DOGE and his ardent support of far-right politicians. “The protests that you'll see out there, they're very organized. They're paid for,” he said, without evidence.



Then he pivoted. Although Musk described DOGE as “critical work,” he said that his “time allocation” there “will drop significantly” next month, down to just one or two days a week. He's taking a big step back from politics and returning the bulk of his attention to Tesla, as even his most enthusiastic supporters have begged him to do. (Tesla did not immediately return a request for comment.)

Read: The Tesla revolt

One bad quarter won't doom Tesla, but it's unclear how, exactly, the company can move forward from here. Arguably, its biggest and most immediate problem is that electric-vehicle fans in America, who tend to lean left politically, do not want to buy Musk's cars anymore. The so-called Tesla Takedown protests have given people who feel helpless and angry about President Donald Trump's policies a tangible place to direct their anger. Because Musk was also the Trump campaign's biggest financier, those protesters saw a Tesla boycott as one of the best ways to hit back. The fact that these demonstrations were the first thing Musk brought up on the earnings call speaks volumes about how rattled he must be; Tesla purchases have been down considerably this year in the U.S., even as EV sales keep rising.



And while some people in Europe may believe they do not have much cause to care about DOGE, they do care that Musk has been promoting far-right political actors, most notably Germany's Alternative for Germany party. That seems to be having a palpable impact on Tesla's sales; they've been tanking by double-digits across Europe.



Buyers are turning to other car brands for their electric-powered driving needs, and those brands are happy to take their business. Tesla may have effectively created the modern EV sector, but the competition is catching up. In the U.S. alone, several car companies now offer electric options with more range, better features, and lower prices than Tesla. A long-awaited cheaper new Tesla could bring in more buyers, but there's been little fanfare around it, perhaps because Musk is preoccupied with autonomous taxis and self-driving cars; a new “robotaxi” service is supposedly launching in June, in Austin. Yet any self-driving-technology investment depends on Tesla's ability to sell cars right now to finance those dreams, and that's where Tesla is likely to continue to have trouble.

Read: The great Tesla sell-off

Finally, there's the bigger problem of China. Musk's company effectively showed that country how to make modern EVs, and although Teslas still sell well enough there, Musk is up against dozens of new Tesla-like companies that have taken his ideas and run wild. Electric cars in China can be had with more advanced features than what Tesla offers, faster charging times, and more advanced approaches to automated driving. (Case in point: I am writing this story in Shanghai, from the passenger's seat of an EV that can swap its depleted battery for a fresh one in mere minutes.)



At most companies, it'd be long past time to show the CEO the door. But Tesla's stock price is inextricably linked to Musk and his onetime image as Silicon Valley's greatest living genius. Even if Musk were to move on, it's unclear whether Tesla as a brand could recover, Robby DeGraff, an analyst at the research firm AutoPacific, told me. “I'm genuinely not convinced removing him would be enough,” DeGraff said. “I do believe the potential is there for the brand to steer itself around with exciting, quality, innovative products. But there's a colossal amount of repair work that needs to be done behind the scenes first.”



Unfortunately for Tesla, the great disruptor of the automotive industry is beginning to feel a lot like a “legacy” car company, struggling to figure out what's next and getting lapped by newcomers. The competition has the advantage of not being inextricably tied to a boss who's made the brand so toxic that people would rather go to his dealerships to wave angry signs than to buy cars. If Tesla's future rests on left-leaning EV fans forgiving Musk for backing Trump, boosting the AfD party in Germany, and gleefully putting hundreds of thousands of federal employees out of work, then Musk may find himself longing for the days when his biggest problem was building a wild-looking stainless-steel truck.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Gold has become a rare safe bet in Trump's economy.

by  Nicole Narea

If anything is safe from the economic chaos caused by President Donald Trump's tariffs, it's probably gold — or at least that's what investors seem to think.

The price of gold has increased rapidly in the months since Trump took office, surging particularly since his March 2 announcement of a baseline 10 percent tariff on all US imports. This week, it briefly climbed to a record high of more than $3,500 per ounce during day trading, before closing slightly lower than that.

The uncertainty and projected losses caused by those tariffs have sent the stock market spiraling downward, with the S&P 500 falling more than 8 percent in the last month. The tariffs have also scrambled the markets for other traditionally safe investments linked to the US, like Treasury bonds and the US dollar.

US Treasury bonds have seen a major selloff in recent weeks, with yields climbing to alarmingly high levels. (High yields are typically a sign that investors are losing confidence in the US economy.) They spiked again after Trump called Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell a “major loser” in a Truth Social post on Monday. He has been threatening to fire Powell if he does not lower interest rates, something Powell's Federal Reserve can't do without risking higher inflation. 

Investors who once stocked up on cash are rethinking that as well. The value of the US dollar hit a three-year low on Monday after Trump's Truth Social post about Powell, as international fears begin to mount that the president's haphazard tariff policies could force banks to choose something other than the dollar as the world's global reserve currency. (Since the post-World War II era, central banks around the world have stashed their financial reserves in US dollars, seeing it as a safe, dependable asset.)

All of that has meant that investors are now flocking to gold, the value of which is not tied to the US economy, because it is a tangible, scarce resource that has value in and of itself. It has historically retained that value, even amid economic crises or periods of high inflation, making it more reliable than bonds, stocks, or dollars. And because the supply of gold is limited, increased demand has meant skyrocketing prices. 

The price did come down somewhat to under $3,400 on Tuesday afternoon after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a closed-door investor meeting that the US would have to de-escalate its trade war with China. But it's still higher than it was even a few weeks ago.

The price doesn't seem likely to come down significantly further in the near future. Goldman Sachs projects that by the end of 2025, the price will increase to $3,700 or even higher if central banks worldwide purchase an average of 100 tons of gold per month. Central banks had already been on a gold-buying spree coming into 2025, buying more than 1,000 tons of gold annually in recent years, and that pace is expected to pick up in light of recent economic uncertainty. 

This isn't the first time gold prices have seen a major spike. Throughout periods of economic turbulence in recent history, gold has been seen as a tangible safe haven investment that maintains its value. 

At the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the price of gold jumped from $1,575 in January 2020 to over $2,000 by that summer. 

Amid concerns about the stability of the European economy from 2010 to 2012, the price reached a new high of $1,825.

The Great Recession saw the price rise from about $730 in October 2008 to $1,300 two years later.

This time, we've seen an even starker increase. And unless Trump and Bessent articulate a drastic shift in their economic vision, gold seems unlikely to lose its luster anytime soon.

Computing has a big energy appetite. What does that mean for our climate goals?

by  Umair Irfan

Consider the transistor, the basic unit of computer processors. Transistors can be tiny, down to single-digit nanometers in size. Billions can fit on a computer chip. 

Though they have no moving parts, they devour electricity as they store and modify bits of information. “Ones and zeros are encoded as these high and low voltages,” said Timothy Sherwood, a computer science professor at the University of California Santa Barbara. “When you do any computation, what's happening inside the microprocessor is that there's some one that transitions to a zero, or a zero that transitions to one. Every time that happens, a little bit of energy is used.”

Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

When you add that up — across the billions of transistors on chips and then the billions of these chips in computers and server farms — they form a significant and growing share of humanity's energy appetite.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), computing and storing data accounts for somewhere between 1 and 1.5 percent of global electricity demand at the moment.

With the growth of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies that rely on industrial-scale data centers, that share is poised to grow. For instance, a typical Google search uses about 0.3 watt-hours while a ChatGPT query consumes 2.9 watt-hours. In 2024, the amount of data center capacity under construction in the US jumped 70 percent compared to 2023. Some of the tech companies leaning into AI have seen their greenhouse gas emissions surge and are finding it harder to meet their own environmental goals.

How much more electricity will this computation need in the years ahead, and will it put our climate change goals out of reach?

The IEA estimates that data center energy demand will double by 2030. McKinsey estimates somewhere between a tripling and a quintupling. As a result, major tech players are desperately trying to shore up their power supplies. Over the past year, they've been some of the largest purchasers of energy sources that produce few greenhouse gas emissions. Amazon is the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world. Companies like Microsoft are even reviving old nuclear plants while also investing in the next generation of nuclear technology.

But some of these companies aren't picky about where their power is coming from. “What we need from you,” former Google CEO Eric Schmidt told the House Energy and Commerce committee earlier this month, is “energy in all forms, renewable, nonrenewable, whatever. It needs to be there, and it needs to be there quickly.”

Already, energy demand from data centers is extending a lifeline to old coal power plants and is creating a market for new natural gas plants. The IEA estimates that over the next five years, renewables will meet half of the additional electricity demand from data centers, followed by natural gas, coal, and nuclear power.

However, a lot of these energy demand forecasts are projections based on current trends, and well, a lot of things are changing very quickly. “The first thing I'll say is that there's just a lot of uncertainty about how data center energy demand will grow,” said Jessika Trancik, a professor at MIT studying the tech sector and energy. 

Here is some context to keep in mind: Remember that data centers are less than 2 percent of overall electricity demand now and even doubling, tripling, or quintupling would still keep their share in the single digits. A larger portion of global electricity demand growth is poised to come from developing countries industrializing and climbing up the income ladder. Energy use is also linked to the economy; in a recession, for example, power demand tends to fall. 

Climate change could play a role as well. One of the biggest drivers of electricity demand last year was simply that it was so hot out, leading more people to switch on air conditioners. So while AI is an important, growing energy user, it's not the only thing altering the future of energy demand. 

We're also in the Cambrian explosion era of crypto and AI companies, meaning there are a lot of different firms trying out a variety of approaches. All of this experimentation is spiking energy use in the near term, but not all of these approaches are going to make it. As these sectors mature and their players consolidate, that could drive down energy demand too. 

The good news is that computers are getting more efficient. AI and crypto harness graphical processing units, chips optimized for the kinds of calculations behind these technologies. GPUs have made massive performance leaps, particularly when it comes to the ability of AI to take in new information and generate conclusions. 

“In the past 10 years, our platform has become 100,000 times more energy efficient for the exact same inference workload,” said Joshua Parker, who leads corporate sustainability efforts at Nvidia, one of the largest GPU producers in the world. “In the past two years — one generation of our product — we've become 25 times more energy efficient.”

Nvidia has now established a commanding lead in the AI race, making it one of the most valuable companies in history. 

However, as computer processors get more efficient, they cost less to run, which can lead people to use them more, offsetting some of the energy savings. 

“It's easier to make the business case to deploy AI, which means that the footprint is growing, so it's a real paradox,” Parker said. “Ultimately, that kind of exponential growth only continues if you actually reach zero incremental costs. There's still costs to the energy and there's still cost to the computation. As much as we're driving towards efficiency, there will be a balance in the end because it's not free.”

Another factor to consider is that AI tools can have their own environmental benefits. Using AI to perform simulations can avoid some of the need for expensive, slow, energy-intensive real-world testing when designing aircraft, for example. Grid operators are using AI to optimize electricity distribution to integrate renewables, increase reliability, and reduce waste. AI has already helped design better batteries and better solar cells. 

Amid all this uncertainty about the future, there are still paths that could keep AI's expansion aligned with efforts to limit climate change. Tech companies need to continue pulling on the efficiency lever. These sectors also have big opportunities to reduce carbon emissions in the supply chains for these devices, and in the infrastructure for data centers. Deploying vastly more clean energy is essential. 

We've already seen a number of countries grow their economies while cutting greenhouse gases. While AI is slowing some of that progress right now, it doesn't have to worsen climate change over the long term, and it could accelerate efforts to keep it in check. But it won't happen by chance, and will require deliberate action to get on track. 

“It's easy to write the headline that says AI is going to break the grid, it's going to lead to more emissions,” Parker said. “I'm personally very optimistic — I think this is credible optimism — that AI over time will be the best tool for sustainability the world has ever seen.”

Innovation is a resource we can mine.

by  Umair Irfan

Twenty years ago, few people would have been able to imagine the energy landscape of today. In 2005, US oil production, after a long decline, had fallen to its lowest levels in decades, and few experts thought that would change. 

The US invasion of Iraq had sent gasoline prices skyward. Solar and wind power provided a tiny fraction of overall electricity, showing moderate growth every year. With domestic natural gas running short, coastal states were preparing to build import terminals to bring gas from abroad. Americans were beginning to rethink their love of giant cars as the 7,000-pound Ford Excursion SUV entered its final year of production. In short, the US was preparing for a world with a rising demand for ever scarcer, more expensive fossil fuels, most of which would have to come from abroad. 

That was then. Today, the energy picture couldn't be more different. 

In the mid-2000s, the fracking revolution took off, making the US the largest oil and natural gas producer in the world. But clean energy began surging as well. Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which created new incentives to deploy wind and solar power. Batteries became better and cheaper. Just about every carmaker now has an electric vehicle for sale. These weren't just the product of steady advances but breakthroughs — new inventions, policies, and expanding economies of scale that aligned prices and performance to push energy technologies to unexpected heights. 

So what will come next? That's the challenge for those charged with building tomorrow's energy infrastructure. And right now, the world is especially uncertain about what's to come, with overall energy demand experiencing major growth for the first time in decades, in part due to power-hungry data centers behind AI. The policy chaos from the Trump administration and looming threats of tariffs are making it even harder for the global energy sector to invest and build for the future.

If you're running a utility, building a factory, or designing power transmission routes, how do you even begin to plan? 

To think through this conundrum, I spoke to Erin Baker. She is a professor of engineering and the faculty director of the Energy Transition Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She has studied technology and policy changes in the energy sector for decades, with an eye toward how to make big decisions under uncertain circumstances. 

I asked her about whether there are any other big step changes on the horizon for technologies that can help us contain climate change, and what we can do to stack the deck in their favor. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. 

Can you define “breakthrough” or explain how it's different from an incremental advance? 

A lot of really important innovation has been incremental. We've had amazing “breakthroughs” in a way with batteries, with wind energy, but it has happened over time. An example of a kind of a breakthrough was fracking, because that was a revolution, but for a long time, everybody ignored the importance of all the various technologies horizontal drilling, shale fracture fluid, subsurface mapping] developing in the background, or didn't think it was going to happen. That one was a big step change when the price, performance, and shale gas field discoveries converged. 

Whereas with solar, it just kept getting cheaper consistently faster than we expected. One way you can define “breakthrough” is you can look at what everyone's expecting and see when you do better than that. So breakthroughs are kind of surprises. 

So perhaps it's better to think of a breakthrough not necessarily as an invention, but rather a point at which a technology becomes viable?

Right. 

Then can you put the recent clean tech advances we've seen into context? Have we seen anything like this before? 

I think that we've always had a lot of technological change. I don't think it's just around clean energy. If there is some kind of incentive, then energy developers will be very clever at finding solutions. As we realize that renewable energy has a lot of benefits to it, the more we focused on it, the more we were like, “Whoa, this is 10 times better than anybody thought it was going to be.” 

With clean energy, a big part of the rationale is its environmental and climate benefits, rather than simply profit. There's sort of a moral motivation baked in. Does that motivation matter? 

For many technologies, there are always true believers. Most people who get really excited about an invention are not just trying to make a profit. I think they're almost always really into the technology itself. 

So with renewable energy, people have been excited for a very, very long time. That excitement tided people over for many years when those sources weren't all that profitable. Solar took a long time for it to become great. The reason people focused on it was because of their vision that this has such potential for energy and the environment. So I think that the moral dimension does play a role.

With a trade war kicking off, a lot of the raw materials and finished products in clean energy are likely to get more expensive. Is there a chance of backsliding in clean energy progress? 

I don't think we're going to lose the technology advances. [Development] can slow down. We saw that for offshore wind, with the COVID-induced inflation and higher interest rates slowing the industry down. We're not losing any benefits of the technology though, and in fact it will probably induce new technological change. To me those kinds of things are temporary. Trade wars and stuff like that, they're bad. They will slow things down, but they won't stop innovation.

There's also competition against clean energy. You talked about fracking and how that was an unexpected breakthrough. I remember in the 1990s people were talking about peak oil, and then that discussion went away because we just kept finding more oil and more exploitable resources. It seems like those same price and performance pressures on clean tech to improve also apply on the fossil side, and there's still a ton of money and innovation there.

Are there any breakthroughs in fossil energy that could counteract progress in clean tech?

That is a good point. Yeah, that peak oil thing used to drive me crazy. When it was a big thing, what I kept trying to explain to people that the industry will just innovate. The higher the price of oil gets, the more we're going to figure out how to get oil out of the ground. 

There could be more innovations in fossil fuels, but where we are in the US, climate change is a very real problem and it's hitting people today. It's not going away. I think that the majority of focus on innovation is going to be things that can help us deal with climate change while living high-quality lives. 

Being at a university, I see that the young bright students are not dying to get into fossil fuels. Most of them want to build a world that's going to be liveable for them, for their children. That gets back to what you were saying: Does it matter what the underlying reason is for innovating? And I guess when I think of it that way, it does matter. Young people want to make a better world. And so they are excited to go into clean energy, not into dirty energy.

How do we start planning for another step change in clean energy? How do we prepare for stuff that we haven't invented yet?

Investing in science and engineering is obviously a good idea if we want to have more kinds of scientific breakthroughs. But yeah, given that we don't know what the technology of tomorrow is going to look like, we really want to focus on flexibility and adaptability in the near term. 

Something that I think is important but not always very sexy or appealing is to streamline the grid interconnection process. Every time a new energy project wants to connect to the power grid they have to get into this interconnection queue. The grid operators have to do a study and see how it's going to affect the rest of the grid. That process is really slow and inefficient; it can take years and years for things to get on the grid. 

Speeding that up is something that's going to be useful broadly. You don't need to predict if it's going to be enhanced geothermal or if it's going to be new versions of solar that will win out to get that queue working better. 

Similarly, we need to build new transmission where and when it's needed. It would be independent of where we end up on the energy supply side. Some of these battery technologies are facilitating distributed resources like rooftop solar and microgrids. Thinking about just how to integrate them on the main power grid would be useful. 

What do you see as the government's role in facilitating this?

Certainly investing in science and engineering. A lot of it is also setting goals for specific technologies. It's important because it coordinates the supply chain. That's something that state or federal governments could do if they really have a vision. It doesn't even cost very much money. A lot of it is reviewing and streamlining regulatory processes to make sure that regulation is doing what it should do. 

What about things like investing in companies or offering financing to startups? 

One thing that I think is really interesting is the idea of green bonds so that you can borrow money at a lower interest rate when what you're doing is good for the environment. I don't think that involves the government exactly picking companies; it just means you're making this money available if you follow certain guidelines. 

Permitting risk is a kind of a bureaucratic risk, and the government could reduce that by understanding if there's going to be a huge public pushback in building a certain area rather than every developer going out to do all their own individual work. 

One example is offshore wind in Europe. There, the state does a lot of work before the developers get there in understanding the specific sites. By the time they allocate the regions to build, they've done a lot of the work that takes a lot of the risk out of it, and then they put it up for bids to private companies. Mechanisms like that can be really useful.

For energy project developers, how do you decide whether to use what you can get off the shelf now versus waiting a few years, maybe another decade, for something better?

A friend of mine many years ago did some research on that, and basically she found that if things are improving at a pretty fast rate, it's almost always worth it to go ahead and invest in what you have now because you're going to get a lot of value out of it. Yes, it's possible that 10 years from now, it'll be something even better, but you're already getting a lot of value from what you're doing.

I don't see many developers waiting around for a better technology. I think we have a lot of good options.

America's EV charging network is stronger than ever.

by  Adam Clark Estes

There's a bodega on the corner where I live in Brooklyn, New York, with a massive TikTok following and a thick cable almost always stretched out the front door and plugged into a Tesla. In a tiny parking lot around the corner, the local grocery store has a fast charger that looks like a mini gas pump. The parking garage down the hill has a line of public chargers.

Brooklyn looks different than the rest of America, but this mix of solutions for fueling up our battery-powered cars highlights an increasingly obvious fact about the future. As we continue to transition to electric vehicles, the gas station of the future won't just be those big pavilions on the roadside with 20-foot-tall signs bearing an oil company's logo. You'll probably be able to buy fossil fuels at gas stations for decades, but you'll also be able to charge your EV very quickly. And those familiar fueling destinations won't be the only place you can charge.

The future of EV charging is already here. It's everywhere and sometimes not where you'd expect it. 

There are already hundreds of thousands of chargers in people's garages, in supermarket parking lots, in national parks, and yes, even in old-fashioned gas stations. In the near future, if you drive an EV, you won't worry about finding a place to charge your car. You'll get to choose between multiple experiences, based on your needs and desires, and you won't even need to open an app or get out a credit card to charge up and get on your way.

This forecast probably sounds a little bit fantastic in light of recent developments. The Trump administration suspended the rollout of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program, which was established by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and apportioned $5 billion for states to build public EV chargers. The goal was to ensure there were charging stations at least every 50 miles on certain corridors, especially those in rural or low-income areas. 

It's unclear how long Trump's NEVI halt will last. Democrats in Congress were quick to call the administration's actions illegal, and some states were allowed to keep spending the program's previously approved dollars to build chargers. The Trump administration has asked states to submit new plans for approval, although it's not clear if or when they will be approved. Meanwhile, the funding freeze is being challenged in court. So for now, the future of that massive federally funded EV infrastructure project is in chaos. 

Several people in the EV charging industry told me that, with or without federal funds, progress in the charger space can't be stopped. That should be good news to EV owners or potential EV owners who worry that they might end up stranded on the side of the road because they couldn't find a charger before their battery dies — a condition commonly known as “range anxiety.”

“Every single day that goes by, there's more and more public charging infrastructure that goes in the ground, literally every single day,” Mike Battaglia, CEO of Blink Charging, told me. “So each day that goes by, there is less and less range anxiety.”

There are currently over 210,000 EV charging stations in the United States, and that number was growing by about 1,000 per week towards the end of the Biden administration. (Those numbers still pale in comparison to the 1 million-plus gas pumps currently in operation.) The NEVI program aimed to get 500,000 public chargers online by 2030. Of course, exactly where those chargers are and how easy it is to use them matter a lot. 

The infrastructure buildout has historically focused on getting EV chargers built in affluent suburbs and along highways, leaving city centers and rural areas largely unserved. This inequality is worsening over time, according to a recent study led by the Department of Energy. That said, the vast majority of EV owners — 80 percent — have the ability to charge their vehicles at home, which complicates the question of how to build out America's EV charging infrastructure.

If you own an EV or are thinking about getting one, the main thing you need to know is that you'll probably do most of your charging at home. The gas station of the future is effectively your garage or your driveway. The cost per mile of range will vary depending on your local utility rates, but it's safe to say charging at home is cheaper than charging on the go and, for most people, much cheaper than buying gas. 

EV chargers fall into three categories: level 1, level 2, and level 3. A level 1 charger plugs into a regular 120-volt wall outlet and charges slowly, like two to five miles of range per hour. A level 2 charger requires a 240-volt outlet, like the kind a washer-dryer uses, and provides 20 to 30 miles of range per hour. On average, a one-vehicle household drives about 50 miles per day, so charging overnight with either a level 1 or level 2 charger is probably sufficient.

“It's way easier than actually going to a gas station,” said Ingrid Malmgren, senior policy director at Plug in America, an EV advocacy group. “People who charge it at home very rarely charge publicly, usually just on road trips.”

When you do go on road trips, you'll probably encounter level 3 chargers, also known as DC fast chargers. These beasts use higher voltages, usually 400 or 800 volts, to pump EV batteries from a 10 percent charge up to 90 percent in about half an hour. This is as close as it gets to the present-day gas station solution, where you can pull off the road, plug in your car, grab a sandwich, and then get on your way with plenty of charge. Fully charging an EV with a DC fast-charger should still be a fraction of the cost of filling a car with gasoline — although you might end up spending more in the convenience store while you wait.

There are a couple of other variables you'll encounter when venturing out into the world to charge an EV. First of all, not all EVs use the same kind of plug. The North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug, originally designed by Tesla, is quickly becoming, as the name suggests, the standard in North America as more and more carmakers adopt the style. Otherwise, most non-Teslas in the US will use Combined Charging System (CCS) plugs that can be made compatible with NACS charging stations thanks to an adapter. 

This standardization is simplifying the search for a compatible charging station. With NACS becoming the primary plug-in use, more and more drivers can use not only Tesla Superchargers but also growing networks of chargers made by companies like ChargePoint, Blink, Electrify America, and EV Connect. Even paying for a charge is getting streamlined thanks to software updates that are popularizing an international encrypted communication standard colloquially known as Plug and Charge. As the name implies, at stations with this feature, you simply plug in your EV, and the station recognizes your car and charges your payment option of choice. There's no need to download an app or tap a credit card.

It's very likely you will have this fast charging experience at a place that also sells gas and diesel. Many fossil fuel companies see the writing on the wall and are investing in EV charging infrastructure for all your energy needs. Shell has its Shell Recharge Brand, BP has BP Pulse, Pilot and Flying J have GM Energy co-branded stations. This is just good business sense. If people are already used to going to the gas station, why not provide their fuel of choice when they switch to an EV? And this year, EVs will account for 10 percent of all new vehicles sold in the US this year, according to Cox Automotive. 

Things could get even more interesting as the EV market grows and the need to keep giant tanks of explosive fossil fuels underground fades away. Those big holes in the ground could be filled with battery storage, and those familiar pavilions that keep drivers dry as they fill up their vehicles could be covered in solar panels. This type of design could turn EV charging stations into their own little power plants, where solar energy fills up those batteries, which contribute to grid stability as EVs draw large amounts of power. Electrify America has already opened one hub with this concept in mind and has ambitious plans to deploy more than 150 onsite battery systems nationwide.

As exciting as these futuristic gas stations sound, however, your best bet is almost certainly to find a way to charge your car at home and probably overnight. Then try to remember that you're probably going to drive less than you thought the next day. Range anxiety is real, but it's also irrational. 

“The mindset of ‘I need a vehicle that can do 400 miles and be recharged in 10 minutes.' That has to change,” John Eichberger, executive director of the Transportation Energy Institute, told me. 

After all, most people don't drive 400 miles in a week, much less a day. And once you start driving an EV, you'll also start spotting charging stations everywhere. The parking garage down the hill, the local grocery store, the bodega on the corner — everywhere I turn in my Brooklyn neighborhood, there's a place to plug in. Now if I only had an EV.

﻿Lab-grown blood could save tens of thousands of lives. Is it possible?

by  Noam Hassenfeld

In his free time, while working as a clerk at a local Australian railway, James Harrison saved millions of lives — with his blood.

Harrison had particularly special plasma: It had a rare antibody that doctors used to make a medication for pregnant mothers with different blood types from their newborns. When this happens, it can lead to the mother's immune system attacking the still-developing red blood cells of the fetus.

But it's not like the doctors drew blood one time, found this special antibody, and made a cure that they could end up reusing. Harrison had to keep donating his blood. Almost 1,200 times. 

He was terrified of needles, he had to travel an hour each way to the lab, and still, he kept donating over and over, every two weeks or so. For 64 consecutive years, until he died in his sleep in March, having saved almost 2.5 million babies in Australia.

But the reason he had to do all this in the first place is because scientists still don't really understand blood.

Nicola Twilley, the host of Vox Media's Gastropod podcast, wrote a piece for the New Yorker earlier this year about blood and the scientists trying to understand how it does what it does. On the latest episode of the Unexplainable podcast, she spoke with host Noam Hassenfeld about the quest for artificial blood on the latest.

Americans are buying up mobile homes — and flipping them for big profits

Byron Sellers had wanted to get into real estate investing for years, but the deals he came across were always prohibitively expensive. One day in 2017, he was listening to a real estate podcast while driving for Lyft when he heard about something different: flipping mobile homes.

""I was like, 'Wow, she's saying it just takes $3,000 or $5,000 to start?'"" Sellers remembers. His passengers wanted him to switch to music, so he texted the podcast to his wife, Sharnice, asking her to give it a listen. ""When I came home, she was excited. It was like: 'Hey, you want to do it? I want to do it. Let's do it.'""

The Sellerses did some research, took out a $10,000 high-interest consumer loan, and began poring over Google Maps to locate trailer parks near Chicago, where they were renting an apartment. Then they hit the road. After checking out more than 40 units for sale, they spotted the right deal. The manager of a mobile home park 90 minutes outside the city had some units he was trying to unload. ""Make me an offer,"" he said. They suggested $4,300 for the two they were interested in. He bit. Byron and Sharnice were now the proud owners of two mobile homes, their first real estate investment.

One of the units was move-in ready; the other needed work. With help from Sharnice's father, the couple put in new flooring, refurbished the bathroom, replaced the appliances, and painted the interior. Then the Sellerses sold both units, netting $10,000 for the turnkey mobile home and $9,500 for the one they flipped. All told, they'd gone from finding to buying to flipping to selling in under 60 days.

This is mobile home investing, an unsexy, little-known sector that happens to be recession-proof, meeting a nearly bottomless demand, and earning some of the best returns in the housing industry. Its low price of entry is allowing an entirely new crop of entrepreneur — many of them Black, as the Sellerses are, or coming from very modest backgrounds. (A 2021 survey by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Managers found that 73 percent of industry workers are white males.) With housing costs rising across America, many mobile home flippers are finding the opportunities so plentiful that they're now training other wannabe real estate moguls in the practice, earning a significant chunk of their income from mentorships and tutorials that help more people like them enter the field.

While they don't get a lot of attention, mobile homes — ""manufactured housing"" per marketing and policy wonks, or ""trailers"" in other circles — are the country's biggest source of unsubsidized low-income housing, providing shelter to 21 million Americans. As the nation's housing crisis grows, they're becoming increasingly attractive to people who can't afford a traditional site-built home. Between 2014 and 2024, the number of new manufactured homes shipped across the country increased by over 60%, according to census data.

""Demand is through the roof, supply is barely catching up, rents are accelerating, and occupancy is as high as it's ever been,"" a report from the industry publication Multi-Housing News noted in December. ""They are the lowest cost of homeownership in nearly every market in America.""

They're cheap in part because the selling price rarely includes land; most buyers pay only for the structure. They're also factory-built, benefiting from economies of scale. And unlike stick-built houses, mobile homes are classified as personal property, like cars, which results in lower property taxes and home insurance costs. Historically, they've also depreciated like cars.

But that's changing in today's housing market. A few months ago, LendingTree reported that between 2018 and 2023 the average sales price of new mobile homes went up by almost 60%, to $124,000 from $78,000. And the Urban Institute found that while there's more volatility in the manufactured housing market and location matters, the homes generally appreciate much like site-built properties, at about 5% a year.

About 30% of mobile home residents live in parks where they may own the home but lease the land underneath it. In those cases, park managers are motivated to fill vacant units so they can continue to collect rent on the lot. Investors use that to their advantage. They might spend hours in the communities, cultivating relationships with managers and looking for homes that are available for purchase. Like more traditional real estate investors, they call it ""driving for dollars.""

""We basically drive through these parks and if they look abandoned, we take note,"" says Mersadez Joseph, an EMT in Columbia, South Carolina, who flips mobile homes on the side with her husband, Devon. ""Then we follow up with the manager. We kind of pitch it to them to let them know, 'Hey, we can make you all some money and get you a tenant in there, if you allow us to fix it up.'"" Over the past four years, the Josephs have done about 20 deals and have earned about $250,000. They look to sell every home for double what they put into it.

Other investors spend time in rural areas, spying out vacant mobile homes on private property. The houses are often considered so worthless that many landowners will sell them for a song.

""They'll say, 'Hey, I got a mobile home and I want to get rid of it,'"" says Michael Wiley, an investor in Dothan, Alabama. ""Sometimes they might put a decent little price on it, but most of the time they just want to get rid of it."" Wiley acquired one for a dollar; for another, a double-wide, he paid $1,000 and then sold it for $30,000. Wiley worked in a factory and did graphic design before getting into mobile homes. ""We hit six figures in that first year.""

The work does require a lot of elbow grease. Some units just need a good cleaning and a fresh coat of paint; others have rotted subflooring, old insulation, and broken windows that all need replacing. After that, the investor will have to market and sell them on Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist, either outright to a buyer or wholesaler, or through seller financing. Investors say the downsides of the mobile homes business aren't much different from those of other real estate fields: homes that turn out to be in worse condition than the buyers had thought, difficult tenants, unscrupulous contractors.

The sector's high returns are often characterized by desperation. Facing a lost spouse or job or some other hardship, sellers are often willing to dispose of a home cheaply because they need the quick cash. Buyers are hungry for something, anything, they can afford. They aren't looking to build equity; they're seeking shelter, at a time when both conventional homeownership and rentals have soared out of reach for many. Mobile homes exist in an alternate reality, one where a home purchase can be completed in a day without the help of attorneys or appraisers, where the cost of a used unit floats depending on its actual value to the buyer and seller.

""If you put a message on Facebook Marketplace saying 'I have a home to sell on payments,' you'd be overwhelmed,"" says John Fedro, an investor in Austin. He's been in the field since 2002 and now owns several mobile home parks. Like the other mom-and-pop investors interviewed for this story, he sees himself as providing an important and helpful service. The demand is so great, Fedro says, that people will happily buy retrofitted homes built before 1976, the year the Department of Housing and Urban Development began regulating mobile homes. The earlier homes were more shoddily built, with cheaper plumbing and electrical systems, but many are still around.

Not everyone views the work through the lens of service. In the past few years, private equity firms have discovered how lucrative mobile home parks can be. ""In 2020-21, institutional investors accounted for 23 percent of all manufactured home purchases, up from 13 percent in 2017-19,"" the Private Equity Stakeholder Project wrote in a recent report. Mobile home parks have a 22% annual compounded return, the highest in the real estate field, the report said, and firms like Blackstone are spending millions to acquire communities around the country. Many subsequently raise the rent on the parks' mobile home lots, and residents, who usually can't afford to move the units, are stuck.

Small-scale investors say they're watching the phenomenon as rents climb, but so far, it's not affecting their business.

The Instagram video starts with a drone shot that descends from above and lingers on a couple in matching black T-shirts who are standing in a mobile home park. ""Allow us to reintroduce ourselves. We are Byron and Sharnice Sellers, founders of Mobile Home Elite Investors,"" read the captions, accompanied by Jay-Z's ""Public Service Announcement."" ""We currently have five mobile home parks. Follow us for mobile home and mobile home park investing.""

Byron and Sharnice have done very well since that aha moment in 2017. Sharnice left her job with a Chicago gas company, Byron stopped driving for Lyft, and they began investing all their time in finding and selling mobile homes. First they flipped them, then they dived into seller financing, and then they started buying parks. Last year, the couple moved to Florida, in part because the mobile home market there is so strong.

Pretty early, Byron realized they could make money teaching others how to do it, too. ""It kind of just took off,"" he said.

It's not a brand-new idea. For over a dozen years, Mobile Home University has been offering trainings to aspiring investors that currently start at $550. But it's focused on teaching people how to buy entire parks — and then raise the rent on tenants.

Fedro for years has also been offering trainings and tutorials in buying and selling individual homes; right now, a one-on-one mentorship throughout the client's first three deals is almost $3,000. But the Sellerses were some of the first mobile home investors of color to begin showing others how to get into the field. Now there are many, including Mersadez, who posts TikTok videos under the moniker Mobile Home Bae; Wiley's Flippin' Mobile Homes; and Mobile Home Gurl. Each has a slightly different model, but they often include a mix of free social media content covering some basics, paid online courses outlining the details of how to find and sell homes, and one-on-one mentoring to respond to specific questions.

Byron and Sharnice — who are now earning more from the trainings than from their actual investments — estimate they've taught more than 17,000 would-be investors. Virtually all of them have been Black. ""I feel like it gives them the confidence to say, 'Hey, if they can do it and be this successful, I know I can do it too,'"" says Sharnice.

Real estate investing requires an aggressive drive and a hustle, and not every student has thrived. But some have. Jenisha and DaVon Nelson took the Sellerses' online course in 2020 and began implementing their lessons shortly afterward. Jenisha, a nurse, grew up in a mobile home and was intrigued by the concept.

""It was as simple as taking doughnuts to a park manager to introduce ourselves, get our faces out there,"" she says. But their business didn't really take off until they moved from Arizona to Spartanburg, South Carolina, where Jenisha is from. Since then, they've done about 13 deals, and they wear T-shirts sporting their logo wherever they go, as a conversation starter. ""It's a way of life now,"" says Jenisha.

This current moment might not last, however. Many housing advocates have begun eyeing mobile homes as a solution to the country's housing shortage — after some key protections are enacted, that is. Arica Young, who leads the Innovations in Manufactured Homes Network at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, says her organization is focused on ""addressing issues in the sector, including quality, efficiency, tenant security, finance, and land use."" Local zoning laws, for example, explicitly ban manufactured housing in communities all over the country — even though many modern units are indistinguishable from traditional homes. And the classic image of a mobile home smashed to bits by a tornado isn't wrong; older homes or those that aren't securely fastened to the ground are vulnerable to extreme weather.

More protections would most likely mean higher prices, though, and could eventually lead to these investors being priced out of the market. For now, however, they're aiming to connecti buyers with what's becoming, in the US, a scarce resource.

As Byron Sellers puts it, ""Where else in America are you going to find a move-in-ready house for less than $30,000 to $50,000?""

War in Ukraine:

President Donald Trump ratcheted up pressure on Volodymyr Zelenskiy to accept a peace deal that critics fear will favor Moscow, accusing the Ukrainian president of prolonging the war that's now in its fourth year.

Trump's latest broadside against Zelenskiy, made on Truth Social, comes even as Ukraine and its European allies have sought to slow Trump's rush to a deal over fears it will sacrifice Ukrainian and European security. They insist that a ceasefire and clarity over security guarantees for Ukraine must precede any deal that involves negotiations over territory, according to people familiar with the matter.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday said that ""there is an opportunity for a big deal here"" on trade issues between the United States and China.

""If they want to rebalance, let's do it together,"" Bessent said during an appearance at the Institute of International Trade and Finance in Washington, D.C.

""This is an incredible opportunity. I think if Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio were to write something, he could call it a beautiful rebalancing.

Dalio, on April 13, told NBC News that he was worried that President Donald Trump's tariff and economic policies would threaten the world's economy, potentially to the point of ""something worse than a recession.""

Trump has imposed ultra-high tariffs on China, of 145%. Shortly before Bessent spoke on Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump administration was considering reducing those tariffs to between 50% and 65%, which would still be extremely high, relatively speaking.

Bessent, in his address to the IITF, outlined what he called ""a blueprint to restore equilibrium to the global financial system and the institutions designed to uphold it,"" specifically the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.

""The IMF and World Bank have enduring value,"" Bessent said. ""But mission creep has knocked these institutions off course. We must enact key reforms to ensure the Bretton Woods institutions are serving their stakeholders — not the other way around.""

He said that ""Intentional policy choices by other countries have hollowed out America's manufacturing sector and undermined our critical supply chains, putting our national and economic security at risk.

""President Trump has taken strong action to address these imbalances and the negative impacts they have on Americans.  

This status quo of large and persistent imbalances is not sustainable. It is not sustainable for the United States, and ultimately, it is not sustainable for other economies.

Bessent called out the World Bank for lending to nations that have advanced economic growth, including China.

He suggested that the bank stop lending to China.

""The World Bank continues to lend every year to countries that have met the criteria to graduate from World Bank borrowing,"" Bessent said.

""There is no justification for this continued lending. It siphons off resources from higher priorities and crowds out the development of private markets. It also disincentivizes countries' efforts to move away from dependency on the World Bank and toward job-rich, private sector-led growth.""

Bessent added: ""Going forward, the Bank must set firm graduation timelines for countries that have long since met the graduation criteria. Treating China — the second-largest economy in the world — as a 'developing country' is absurd.

""While it has been at the expense of many Western markets, China's rise has been rapid and impressive,"" he said. ""If China wants to play a role in the global economy commensurate with its actual importance, then the country needs to graduate up, we welcome that.""

In this article

DEARBORN, Mich. — Ford Motor is launching a program that aims to give its most premium pickup truck customers a more curated, exclusive experience.

The Detroit automaker's new ownership experience is for its ""Platinum Plus"" customers. The program ranges from offering a personal concierge and virtual tutorial tours to gifts, accessory discounts and a ""Ford Protect Premium Maintenance Plan"" for 25,000 miles or two years, whichever comes first.

The ""Platinum Plus"" package is the highest-end version of Ford's 2025 F-Series pickup trucks that start around $100,000 for the automaker's Super Duty vehicles. It replaces ""Limited"" models as the priciest pickups for Ford.

""We think it's a competitive advantage, this whole experience. So we're excited about that potential to grow that into the future,"" Brian Rathsburg, marketing manager for Ford F-Series Super Duty, said during an event Tuesday. ""When [customers] purchase the top of the lineup for Super Duty, they expect a more premium experience. And we're excited to kind of start with this concept.""

The new program essentially groups together many services Ford was offering owners individually, while adding a few new ones. Rathsburg said the program will adapt to include whatever experiences customers want.

In addition to the new program, the Platinum Plus vehicles feature plush ""Smoked Truffle"" interiors that include Venetian leather and unique exterior design features such as a satin finish grille with bright chrome inserts.

Rathsburg declined to discuss if President Donald Trump's 25% auto tariffs will impact the price of its F-Series Super Duty pickups, including the new Platinum Plus offering.

""That's a very murky, very uncertain, very tenuous space. We're monitoring it,"" Rathsburg said. ""Certainly, there's things down the road that we may not know about, yet we'll react accordingly.""

Ford last week told dealers it could increase prices on newly built vehicles next month if Trump doesn't ease tariffs on automotive imports, according to Automotive News. That comes after the company has been offering an employee pricing program to promote its U.S. operations, which are the largest among automakers.

The auto industry has offered more curated, exclusive services in the past, but they have largely been for luxury and premium brands rather than mainstream brands or vehicles like Ford's F-Series.

The new service package follows Ford betting big on such curated services for its ""Pro"" fleet customers, including more hands-on assistance as well as logistics and fleet management.

""Everything we see says that this is gonna be a nice improvement for consumers,"" Rathsburg said.

An advertising watchdog said Tuesday that Apple went too far with marketing that touted the availability of Apple Intelligence features that weren't released when the ads were broadcast.

The National Advertising Division, a non-profit focused on ""truth in advertising,"" said that following an inquiry from the organization about Siri improvements, Apple told it that it would permanently discontinue a TV ad called ""More Personal Siri"" that focused on a big AI improvement to Siri. 

That ad premiered in September and promoted the iPhone 16 with unreleased features. In March, Apple said it would delay the release of those features to ""the coming year.""

""NAD recommended that Apple avoid conveying the message that features are available when they are not,"" the group said.

Apple didn't respond to a request for comment. The company told NAD it disagreed with the findings but would follow the group's recommendations, the non-profit said. 

NAD's decision is the latest blow to Apple's reputation with artificial intelligence technology and its struggles to market the iPhone 16's AI features.

Apple is also facing class-action lawsuits over those Apple Intelligence ads, and the company in January turned off its AI summary feature for news apps after users and the BBC discovered that the feature at times twisted headlines to display false information.

Besides pulling the ad, which featured ""The Last of Us"" actor Bella Ramsey, off of YouTube in March, Apple has made other changes to its marketing. 

Apple's website no longer says Apple Intelligence is ""available now"" — the tagline now reads ""AI for the rest of us."" Apple has also begun running a new ad focused on another Apple Intelligence feature called ""Clean Up"" that can edit objects or people out of photo's backgrounds.

The company in June unveiled Apple Intelligence, its marketing term for its suite of AI features. Apple's newest iPhones, the company said at the time, would be able to access image generators, custom emojis, intelligently-summarized notifications, and eventually, a vastly improved Siri.

When the iPhone 16 was released in September, Apple Intelligence was featured on television ads, billboards and the company's website as a key reason to buy the iPhone 16. But the AI features rolled out in waves over the course of months as software updates, even while Apple touted the features.

NAD's decision is focused on Apple promoting features that weren't available to the public at the time of the ads.

""Apple did not adequately disclose that the features were not available and reasonable consumers could take away the message that these features were available at the time these claims were first made, which they were not,"" the decision said.

The NAD is part of BBB National Programs, a non-profit that offers programs to various industries so they can regulate themselves. Companies that participate in the voluntary program agree to submit to and participate in the NAD's evaluation process. 

At the end of a decision, NAD usually decides whether specific advertising claims were supported by facts. If they are unsupported, NAD pushes for changes. The Apple case was brought by the NAD itself, said Phyllis Marcus, NAD vice president.

""Apple participated and agreed to take our decisions and recommendations into account,"" said Phyllis Marcus, the VP of National Advertising Division.

The majority of NAD cases are brought by one company complaining about a rival's ads, but NAD is starting to look at claims around AI tools, Marcus said. The Apple decision signals an increased emphasis by regulators and other oversight organizations to scrutinize AI claims.

In its report, NAD found that some key Apple Intelligence features — such as image generation and ChatGPT integration — weren't available at launch despite being advertised as ""available now.""

The company's claims around Apple Intelligence are now accurate, NAD said. It added that Apple had made changes to its marketing materials about the Siri feature that ""adequately"" communicated the status of the delayed feature.

Most Apple Intelligence features announced last June have launched and are turned on by default on new iPhones in the U.S.

Investors are looking for signs that Apple Intelligence could boost Apple stock by driving more iPhone upgrades than usual.

About 80% of U.S. users with supported iPhone have tried the features, and more than 50% of current iPhone owners who are looking to upgrade say it will be very important to have Apple Intelligence on their next device, according to results from a Morgan Stanley survey published Tuesday.

Over half of respondents said they would pay $10 or more per month for the feature, the note said, suggesting that consumers see value in the software.

WATCH: Apple has done so much to create new jobs here, just not manufacturing jobs, says Jim Cramer

In this article

The European Union on Wednesday fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros each for breaching the bloc's digital competition laws.

The European Commission, which is the executive body of the EU, said it was fining Apple 500 million euros ($571 million) and Meta 200 million euros ($228.4 million) for breaches of the Digital Markets Act (DMA).

Officials said that Apple failed to comply with so-called ""anti-steering"" obligations under the DMA. Under the EU's tech law, Apple is required to allow developers to freely inform customers of alternative offers outside its App Store.

The tech giant was ordered by the EU to remove technical and commercial restrictions on steering and to refrain from perpetuating its non-compliant conduct in the future.

Apple said in a statement that it planned to appeal the EU fine while continuing its discussions with the Commission.

""Today's announcements are yet another example of the European Commission unfairly targeting Apple in a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free,"" Apple said.

""We have spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for. Despite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way,"" the company added.

For Meta, the EU Commission found that the social media group illegally required users to consent to sharing their data with the company or pay for an ad-free service. This was in response to Meta's introduction of a paid subscription tier for Facebook and Instagram in November 2023.

Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, said in a statement that the Commission was ""attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards.""

""This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service. And by unfairly restricting personalized advertising the European Commission is also hurting European businesses and economies,"" Kaplan said.

The EU said its fine for Meta took into account steps that the tech giant took to comply with its rules through a new version of its free personalized ads service that uses less personal data to display advertisement.

""The Commission is currently assessing this new option and continues its dialogue with Meta, requesting the company to provide evidence of the impact that this new ads model has in practice,"" regulators said.

Meta was sent a cease-and-desist order by the EU ordering it to make changes to its less personalized ads option over the coming 60 days or face further fines, according to a source familiar with the matter, who asked to remain anonymous as the information is not public.

The antitrust decision risks potential retaliation from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has made no secret of his displeasure with the EU's regulatory enforcement actions on America's digital giants.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration imposed so-called ""reciprocal"" tariffs of 20% on EU goods entering the U.S. He later dropped the new tariff rates on dozens of trading partners — including the EU — to 10% for a limited time period for trade negotiations.

The reciprocal tariffs came after Trump earlier issued a directive threatening to impose tariffs on Europe to combat what he called ""overseas extortion"" of American tech companies through digital services taxes, fines, practices and policies.

In this article

Your phone might be inundated with texts offering you a job these days. However, the Federal Trade Commission says many of those job offers aren't from legitimate companies — they are from scammers.

Many people have already lost millions to these text job scams — and the fraud, the FTC says, is on the rise. Consumers reported losing $14.8 million in 2023 — a figure that jumped to $61.2 million in 2024.

""And the worrying thing is that we know these high numbers are just the tip of the iceberg, "" said Kati Daffan, an assistant director of the FTC's Division of Marketing Practices, ""because, of course, not everyone reports to us when they experience this fraud.""

In September 2024, Sunita Dhougoda, a 37-year-old freelance software engineer from North Carolina, also received a text offering a job. Without much thought, the mother of two clicked a Microsoft Teams link and had what turned out to be a written — not video — interview that lasted over an hour.

""The interview went well, and they told me they would get back to me in a few days,"" said Dhougoda.

Three days later, an offer letter arrived — but the email it came from, careers@assurecarecareers.us, instead of the legitimate @assurecare.com, raised red flags. ""It was a scam, so I never responded,"" she said. AssureCare did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Dhougoda was lucky not to fall victim to the job scam. However, over the past four years, job scams via text have seen a sharp rise in both reports and financial losses. According to the FTC, in 2020, there were 4,872 reports of text-based job scams, resulting in $2 million in losses. By 2024, those reports had surged to 20,673, with losses escalating to $61.2 million.

""Anything that is immediate, you're hardwired to respond to it. So, a text has a certain amount of immediacy to it. So you see that (and think) I need to either click on that link or I need to call that phone number, whatever it is that it's asking you to do,"" said James  E. Lee, president of the nonprofit Identity Theft Resource Center. ""We're just sort of natural instinct is to do that, which is why it's important we resist that natural instinct.""

Some experts say people are more vulnerable to job scams during uncertain times like these, when a wave of job cuts draws widespread attention and recession fears make the economy feel increasingly unstable.

""Now that the labor market is more competitive, people may be willing to take jobs that they weren't necessarily willing to take before,"" said Kory Kantenga, LinkedIn's head of economics for the Americas. ""As a result, there may be some advertisements that they receive that they would have previously ignored, that they're willing to click on. Folks who are looking to commit scams know this, and they may be taking advantage of that as a result.""

Watch the video above to learn how the job market and economic uncertainty fuel the rise of text job scams — and how to protect yourself.

BP shares whipsawed on Wednesday after activist investor Elliott went public with a stake of more than 5% in the struggling British oil major, which has pivoted back to oil in a bid to restore investor confidence.

BP shares provisionally closed 0.3% lower, erasing gains of as much as 5% from earlier in the session. The London-listed stock price is down around 8% year-to-date.

Hedge fund Elliott Management has built its holding in the British oil major to 5.006%, according to a regulatory filing disclosed late Tuesday. BP's other large shareholders include BlackRock, Vanguard and Norway's sovereign wealth fund.

Elliott was first reported to have assumed a position in the oil and gas company back in February, driving a share rally amid expectations that its involvement could pressure BP to shift gears from its green strategy and back toward its core oil and gas businesses.

Within weeks, BP, which has been lagging domestic peer Shell and transatlantic rivals and posted a steep drop in fourth-quarter profit, announced plans to ramp up fossil fuel investments to $10 billion through 2027. This marked a sharp strategic departure for the company, which five years ago became one of the first energy giants to announce plans to cut emissions to net zero ""by 2050 or sooner."" As part of that push, the company pledged to slash emissions by up to 40% by 2030 and to ramp up investment in renewables projects.

The oil major scaled back this emissions target to 20% to 30% in February 2023, saying at the time that it needed to keep investing in oil and gas to meet global demand.

Since switching gears, BP's CEO Murray Auchincloss and outgoing Chair Helge Lund — who is expected to depart the company in 2026 — retained their posts but were penalized with reduced support during BP's board re-election vote earlier this month amid pressure from both revenue and climate-focused investors.

BP's strategic reset back to the company's oil and gas activities took place just as crude prices began to plunge amid volatility triggered by U.S. tariffs and Washington's trade spat with China, the world's largest crude importer.

Energy analysts have broadly welcomed the strategic reset, and BP CEO Murray Auchincloss has since said the pivot attracted ""significant interest"" in the firm's non-core assets.

The energy firm nevertheless remains firmly in the spotlight as a potential takeover target, with the likes of Shell and U.S. oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron touted as possible suitors.

BP is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on Tuesday. The company has said it anticipates lower reported upstream production and higher net debt in the first quarter than in the final three months of 2024.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk says China's new trade restrictions on rare earth magnets have affected the production of the company's Optimus humanoid robots, which rely on the exports. 

Speaking on a Tesla earnings call on Tuesday, Musk said that the company was working through the issue with Beijing and hoped to get approval to access the critical resources.

China, earlier this month, imposed new export controls on seven rare earth elements and magnets used in everything from defense to energy to automotive technologies. The move was in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's escalating tariffs.

According to Musk, Beijing has asked Tesla to guarantee that the rare earth magnets under expert control will not be used for military purposes.

""China wants some assurances that these aren't used for military purposes, which obviously they're not. They're just going into a humanoid robot,"" he said.

The new restrictions, which have raised the risk of global shortages, require exporters of medium and heavy rare earths in question to receive licenses from China's Ministry of Commerce.

China dominates the market for many of these rare earths, with the U.S. unprepared to fill a potential shortfall, according to the Center for Strategic & International Studies. 

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has into potential new tariffs on all U.S. imports of critical minerals in response to China's export controls. 

During the earnings call on Tuesday, Musk emphasized the importance of humanoid robots to the company's future plans. 

""The future of the company is fundamentally based upon large scale autonomous cars and large scale, large volume and vast numbers of autonomous humanoid robots,"" he said. 

Previously, Musk had announced plans for Optimus to produce about 5,000 units this year as the technology grows as part of Tesla's future business plans. Moreover, he said that Tesla would deploy the robots in its EV factories. 

It's unclear to what extent export controls might alter these plans. However, Musk reassured investors on Tuesday that the company still plans to produce thousands of robots this year, with thousands also expected to be deployed at Tesla factories.

The emerging technology could help Tesla drive some investor optimism as its EV business struggles, with its stock down about 37% year-to-date.

Steve Westly, founder and managing partner of The Westly Group and former Tesla Board member, told CNBC's 'Closing Bell Overtime' on Tuesday that the company needs to find a new growth engine soon. 

The company is expected to face stiff competition from other humanoid robot players in China, such as Unitree Robotics and AgiBot, both of which reportedly plan to enter mass production this year. The export controls could give the Chinese players another advantage over their U.S. competitors, according to some analysts.

While Musk is upbeat about Tesla's prospects in the space, going so far as to claim that it is ahead of the competition, he is concerned that the leaderboard will be filled with Chinese companies.

Caroline Smith, an accounting director from Verona, New Jersey, and her husband took their two children to Italy for Easter break this month. On the Spanish Steps in Rome, they ran into another family from their town. Two other families from the same area were also independently visiting Italy at the same time, she said.

The families are part of an emerging trend in the $11 trillion global travel industry: Americans are traveling abroad in droves, while the number of visitors to the United States is falling.

Foreign visitors to the United States by air fell nearly 10% in March from the same month a year earlier and nearly 13% from before the pandemic to 4.54 million people, according to data from the International Trade Administration, part of the Commerce Department.

Easter week last year was in March, causing some vacations to shift this year. However, U.S. citizens flying abroad increased 1.6% from last March and are up 22% from 2019 to 6.56 million travelers.

The imbalance could further deepen the more than $50 billion gap between what the U.S. generates through travel and tourism services and what Americans spend abroad. It's a concern for the U.S. travel industry, which brings in about $1 trillion a year. The U.S. Travel Association on Jan. 9 said it expected a more than 12% increase in spending from international tourism in the United States this year.

An on-again, off-again trade war, high-profile detentions of visitors as well as visa holders and permanent residents, along with President Donald Trump's rhetoric about taking over countries like Canada, and a strong U.S. dollar for much of this year and travel warnings haven't helped drum up demand from international travelers.

The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

""This points to potentially another channel to consider in assessing the effect of tariffs on economic activity,"" JPMorgan said in a note Wednesday, adding that a decline in foreign travel spending could subtract around 0.1% from the gross domestic product this year. ""Concerns around detentions of foreign visitors, sometimes by accident, are only compounding this effect.""

Samuel Engel, senior vice president at consulting firm ICF, said that while ""there's no question that foreigners are finding the U.S. less welcoming"" another question is if the hesitance to travel to the U.S. from abroad is now showing up in international business travel.

""Business people don't ink deals in the face of uncertainty,"" he said.

United Airlines last week said bookings from international passengers originating in Europe are down 6%, while those originating in Canada are down 9% year over year. Delta Air Lines said it was seeing a similar phenomenon.

But American consumers' appetite for international trips is helping to soften the blow of fewer international tourists and weaker-than-expected demand in domestic U.S. travel for some companies, like United and Delta, which are cutting back flights within the United States later this year.

""I traveled around Europe a lot pre-kids so I've been trying to do the same with the family now that the kids are older,"" said Smith, 44, who has a 7-year-old and an 11-year-old. ""We went to Spain in 2023 and Portugal in 2024, chosen in part because the flights are short, in comparison to Greece, which is on the list.""

Grace Cular Yee, a travel agent based in Virginia, said a lot of her clients are considering international travel more than domestic in part because they're wanting to splash out on college graduation trips since their kids largely missed out on high school commencement celebrations during Covid.

""This is a major milestone for the whole family,"" she said, adding that while many travelers get ideas from social media, more Americans are also getting inspired by television shows, like the latest season of ""The White Lotus,"" which was set in Thailand. She said she recently planned a trip to France for a mother-daughter high school graduation trip because the daughter loves the show ""Emily in Paris.""

United said that advanced bookings earlier this month are stable and premium-cabin sales are up 17%, while international demand has risen 5%.

Delta's president, Glen Hauenstein, is optimistic that the trend will continue and said cash sales for international travel are coming in ahead of the same point last year.

""Sales that are coming in the door as of yesterday that we're recording today as cash are very strong for international through the summer all the way out to September, October,"" he said on an April 9 earnings call, adding that international sales were up on the year.

Many working Americans and retirees are on edge with recent market tumult, but wealthy and aging travelers, particularly in the pricey front of the plane, are helping to offset that.

""Being a baby boomer, I can say this without fear of retribution: There's only so much time to go to Europe or almost so much time to go see Australia or Japan,"" Hauenstein said on the earnings call. ""So you've got this wealth effect where this cohort of retirees is wealthier than any other cohort even with the most recent rundown, and they want to go do things.""

It isn't clear whether a pullback in consumer spending in the back of the plane or even some softness in corporate travel growth is a sign that high-end, international leisure travel bookings will weaken, too. For now, the labor market remains strong.

""Everybody's life is not fully disrupted but everybody's life is on more tenuous footing right now,"" said ICF's Engel. ""The way people manage uncertainty is they hold back on decisions.""

Correction: Hauenstein spoke on an April 9 earnings call. An earlier version misstated the date.

The latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey found that Americans' opinion of how U.S. President Donald Trump is managing the economy has plunged: For the first time since he entered the White House, more respondents disapprove than approve of the president on the economy.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has been a significant contributor to the Trump administration, has also seen a decline in his and his company's reputations. More than 47% of the American public view Tesla negatively, according to the same survey, compared with just 10% for General Motors. As for Musk himself, around half of the respondents see him in a disapproving light.

Markets, however, are open-minded and often react almost instantaneously to any positive changes. On Tuesday, Trump's denial that he wishes to kick Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell out of office, and Musk's clarification that he will be spending less time in Washington, D.C., were enough to send stock indexes and Tesla shares higher — even though the electric vehicle company's first-quarter earnings missed expectations.

Though Cassio in Shakespeare's play Othello describes reputation as ""the immortal part"" of himself, in the markets, the barometer for character tends to be more forgiving.

'No intention' of firing Powell: TrumpU.S. President Donald Trump has ""no intention"" of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, he told reporters on Tuesday. ""None whatsoever,"" Trump said in the Oval Office when asked to clarify that he did not seek Powell's removal. ""Never did."" That said, the president added that he ""would like to see [Powell] be a little more active in terms of his idea to lower interest rates.""

'De-escalation' in U.S.-China trade war Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a closed-door meeting Tuesday he expects ""there will be a de-escalation"" in Trump's trade war with China in the ""very near future,"" a person in the room told CNBC. Negotiating with China is likely to be ""a slog,"" Bessent said at a private investor summit hosted by JPMorgan Chase, but added that neither side ""thinks the status quo is sustainable.""

Markets jump on promising newsU.S. markets rallied Tuesday on Trump and Bessent's statements. The S&P 500 rose 2.51%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.66% and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.71%. Asia-Pacific markets rose sharply Wednesday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped almost 2.5% and Japan's Nikkei 225 added nearly 2%. However, the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday downgraded its growth forecasts for major Asian economies in 2025, citing trade tensions and ""high policy uncertainty.""

Tesla's earnings fall shortTesla reported Tuesday first-quarter revenue and earnings that missed expectations. Total revenue slid 9% to $19.34 billion from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago. Analysts were expecting a revenue of $21.11 billion and a profit of 39 cents a share, according to LSEG data. Tesla is planning to enter the India market, CFO Vaibhav Tanej said during its earnings call.

Musk says he will spend less time at DOGEDespite Tesla's disappointing earnings, which it announced after the bell, its shares popped more than 5% in extended trading. Investors could be cheering CEO Elon Musk's statement that his time spent running Trump's Department of Government Efficiency will drop ""significantly"" starting in May. As of Monday, Tesla shares were down 44% for the year, generating $11.5 billion in mark-to-market profits for Tesla shorts in 2025.

[PRO] Safe-haven currency amid flight from U.S.As the U.S. dollar slides and the stock market whipsaws, investors are piling into one safe-haven currency. An exchange-traded fund linked to it has surged 8% in April, bringing its 2025 gains to 11%. Paul Feinstein, Audent Global Asset Management CEO, called the currency ""one of the most enduring safe havens.""  

U.S. regulatory scrutiny fans Chinese stock delisting fears

Increased regulatory scrutiny of U.S.-listed Chinese firms has stoked delisting worries, threatening the decade-plus run of Alibaba and other Chinese companies on U.S. exchanges.

A broad ""everything is on the table"" comment from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on April 9 has reignited fears on Wall Street that hundreds of billions of dollars may flow out in a forced delisting of Chinese stocks from U.S. exchanges.

Thanks to the latest version of a law made in 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission can prompt a Chinese stock delisting if the company is deemed noncompliant with audit requests for two straight years. Paul Atkins, sworn in on Monday as SEC chairman, indicated during a hearing last month that he would uphold that process for scrutinizing U.S.-listed Chinese stocks.

Increased regulatory scrutiny of U.S.-listed Chinese firms has stoked delisting worries, threatening the decade-plus run of Alibaba and other Chinese companies on U.S. exchanges.

A broad ""everything is on the table"" comment from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on April 9 has reignited fears on Wall Street that hundreds of billions of dollars may flow out in a forced delisting of Chinese stocks from U.S. exchanges.

Thanks to the latest version of a law made in 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission can prompt a Chinese stock delisting if the company is deemed noncompliant with audit requests for two straight years. Paul Atkins, sworn on Monday as SEC chairman, indicated during a hearing last month that he would uphold that process for scrutinizing U.S.-listed Chinese stocks.

The continuing analyst and press coverage of Bessent's comments reflects how uncertainty is broadening out — even warranting a related piece in the New York Post tabloid.

""In an extreme scenario, U.S. investors may have to liquidate US$800bn worth of holdings in Chinese stocks if they are banned from investing in Chinese securities,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note last week.

They predicted Chinese investors might also need to sell their U.S. financial assets, with an estimated worth of roughly $370 billion in stocks and $1.3 trillion in bonds.

KraneShares, which runs a popular $5.9 billion U.S. exchange-traded fund tracking Chinese stocks, told its clients last week that delisting of Chinese companies was a ""low probability."" Back during an earlier round of delisting fears in 2022, the company started shifting the bulk of its KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB) holdings to the Hong Kong-traded shares of U.S.-listed Chinese companies. KraneShares reiterated taking that approach in the ""unlikely event"" that Chinese companies are delisted in the U.S.

Alibaba listed additional shares in Hong Kong in 2019, five years after a massive initial public offering in New York. While Baidu, JD.com and several other Chinese companies have also offered shares in Hong Kong in recent years, Temu parent PDD Holdings notably has yet to do so.

PDD did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. The e-commerce company moved its headquarters from China to Ireland in 2023.

The backdrop here is U.S. President Donald Trump's ""America First Investment Policy"" memo published in late February. It called for a review of U.S. investments in Chinese entities, as well as renewed scrutiny of publicly traded Chinese companies — both through commonly used listing structures and through the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act that became law in 2020.

The memo is a broad mandate for many government agencies, including the SEC, ""to enforce existing rules and create new rules"" relating to U.S.-listed Chinese companies, said Winston Ma, adjunct professor at NYU School of Law. 

Ma, author of ""The Digital War: How China's Tech Power Shapes the Future of AI, Blockchain and Cyberspace,"" said that if regulators act now, they could use a fiscal reporting period ending April 2025 as year one, meaning that year two would end in 2026, fulfilling the ""two year"" compliance period necessary for delisting. ""Delisting could come faster than you think,"" he said.

The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which falls under the SEC's oversight, said in 2022 that it was able to inspect audit records of potentially affected Chinese companies. For now, ""there are no issuers at risk of having their securities subject to a trading prohibition"" under the law, according to the SEC website.

The SEC did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment, while the PCAOB declined to comment.

The House Select Committee on China late last week sent letters to JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan demanding the investment banks pull out from underwriting the Hong Kong IPO of Chinese battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology. JPMorgan declined to comment, while Bank of America did not respond.

Trump's recent spat with Harvard also means more scrutiny on how U.S. universities' endowment funds have made billions from their Chinese investments.

The House committee previously cited research from U.S. advocacy group Future Union on how U.S. pension funds and university endowments have invested in China.

""Atkins is under pressure to take an assertive stand against decades of duplicitous double standards,"" Future Union Executive Director Andrew King said in an email. He is also managing partner at San Francisco-based venture capital firm Bastille.

""The delisting is overdue, and China overplayed its hand by stonewalling regulators and flaunting cases like Luckin Coffee fraud with inaction,"" he said. ""Now they are going to lose their path to secondary funding without oversight.""

China's securities regulator has sought to increase its oversight of domestic companies listing overseas, especially following ride-hailing company Didi's U.S. IPO in 2021 and its subsequent delisting. Under the Chinese securities regulator's new process, few large Chinese companies have been able to list in the U.S. in recent months, including Chinese milk tea company Chagee just last week.

As the protracted delay over a legally binding TikTok divestiture has shown, the worries over delisting could be exaggerated — at least in the near term. Investors, however, may choose to vote with their feet first.

Impact of U.S.-China trade war ""immaterial"": Xpeng Vice Chairman

Brian Gu, vice chairman of Xpeng, talks about how the Chinese EV maker is weathering a volatile global trade environment: from building its AI chips in-house, to finding ""tremendous potential"" in key foreign markets in Europe and Southeast Asia.

""Everyone is very pessimistic"": Shenzhen Cross-Border E-commerce Association

The Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association represents thousands of Chinese businesses that sell worldwide, including on Amazon. The group's head, Xin Wang, tells CNBC that customers are still buying these goods – but both buyers and sellers are building up their presences in other markets.

Mercedes-Benz CEO on the impact of auto tariffs, unveiling the new CLA and U.S. production 

CNBC's Phil LeBeau and Mercedes-Benz CEO Dimitris Psillakis join ""Closing Bell"" to discuss the impact of auto tariffs, unveiling of the new CLA offering.

The White House is signaling a potential easing in China tensions. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told investors Tuesday he expected the U.S.-China trade war to de-escalate in the ""very near future,"" a person in the room told CNBC. The comments came a day after China vowed retaliation against countries that follow U.S. calls to isolate Beijing.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang visited China and met several prominent figures. Huang had an official meeting with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Beijing Thursday— and reportedly DeepSeek's Liang Wenfeng. The latest Pew Research survey of Americans found a softening in negative views on China.

Local governments in China mull bitcoin sales to shore up empty coffers. That consideration was reported by Reuters on Thursday. China has banned cryptocurrencies for years, and cash-strapped local authorities have been sitting on the seized assets. Unemployment among Chinese youths aged 16 to 24 fell in March to 16.5%, down from 16.9% in February, according to official data.

Chinese and Hong Kong stocks were trading in positive territory Wednesday as investors cheered the potential easing of U.S.-China trade tensions.

Mainland China's CSI 300 rose 0.15% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index — which includes several major Chinese companies — climbed 2.16% as of 11:00 a.m. local time.

Since the start of this year, the CSI 300 has lost 3.7% while the Hang Seng Index has risen 9.67%.

The benchmark 10-year Chinese government bond yield edged up slightly to 1.660%.

The offshore Chinese yuan strengthened marginally to 7.3049 against the greenback.

Tether, SoftBank Group, and Jack Mallers Launch Twenty One, a Bitcoin-native Company, Through a Business Combination With Cantor Equity Partners

Backed by Tether and SoftBank Group, Twenty One is expected to launch with over 42,000 Bitcoin and a mission to maximize Bitcoin Ownership Per Share

Co-founder Jack Mallers will lead Twenty One as CEO

Twenty One is expected to offer investors a singular vehicle for Bitcoin exposure, pro-Bitcoin advocacy, and Bitcoin-focused content and media with plans to explore future expansion into Bitcoin-native financial products.

AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Twenty One Capital, Inc. (“Twenty One” or “the Company”), a newly formed entity, today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement for a business combination with Cantor Equity Partners, Inc. (“CEP”) (Nasdaq: CEP) (the “Business Combination”), a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsored by an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald, a leading global financial services and real estate services holding company.


At the closing of the Business Combination, Twenty One will be majority-owned by Tether, co-founder of Twenty One and the world's largest stablecoin issuer, and Bitfinex, with significant minority ownership by SoftBank Group Corp. (“SoftBank Group”), one of the world's leading investment holding companies.




Twenty One and CEP have also entered into subscription agreements with investors to raise, at closing, $585 million of total additional capital consisting of (i) $385 million through convertible senior secured notes and (ii) $200 million through a common equity PIPE financing (the “PIPE Offerings”, and together with the Business Combination, the “Proposed Transactions”). The net proceeds from the PIPE Offerings, which will close contemporaneously with the Business Combination, will be used to purchase additional Bitcoin and for general corporate purposes. Twenty One expects to launch with more than 42,000 Bitcoin, which would make it the third-largest Bitcoin treasury in the world as of today.




A New Era: Measuring Success in Bitcoin



Twenty One is built to accumulate Bitcoin and grow ownership per share, not just track it.




As part of its launch, Twenty One will introduce two key performance metrics, to reflect its Bitcoin-denominated capital structure and Bitcoin-focused mindset.




Led by Seasoned Founder with Deep Bitcoin Expertise



Twenty One will be led by Co-Founder and CEO Jack Mallers, who has been instrumental in furthering Bitcoin's adoption by institutions, corporations, and governments worldwide, and will continue with his existing roles and responsibilities. As the Founder and CEO of Strike, he has built one of the world's leading digital payment providers on Bitcoin's Lightning Network, pioneering Bitcoin brokerage infrastructure and Bitcoin's integration into corporate balance sheets.




“Markets need reliable money to measure value and allocate capital efficiently,"" said Jack Mallers, Co-Founder and CEO of Twenty One. “We believe that Bitcoin is the answer, and Twenty One is how we bring that answer to public markets. Our mission is simple: to become the most successful company in Bitcoin, the most valuable financial opportunity of our time. We're not here to beat the market, we're here to build a new one. A public stock, built by Bitcoiners, for Bitcoiners.""




“Bitcoin is one of the only truly decentralized, immutable, and censorship-resistant asset, and its role as the foundation of a new financial system is inevitable,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether. “With Jack at the helm, we are proud to support this effort to further Bitcoin's adoption and reinforce its role as the ultimate store of value. At Tether, we have always believed in supporting initiatives that strengthen Bitcoin's dominance and real-world utility. Twenty One will take a Bitcoin-first approach that aligns with our vision—prioritizing accumulation over speculation and building long-term value for those who understand what Bitcoin represents.”




Pioneering Bitcoin-native Financial Solutions



Twenty One is structured to be a day one Bitcoin-native company that will strategically allocate capital to increase Bitcoin per share. Twenty One intends to develop a corporate architecture capable of supporting financial products built with and on Bitcoin. This includes native lending models, capital market instruments, and future innovations that will replace legacy financial tools with Bitcoin-aligned alternatives. As a pro-Bitcoin advocate, Twenty One plans to produce original Bitcoin-focused content and media. This pure-play approach will offer investors access to a public company that combines Bitcoin exposure with an operating business building Bitcoin-native products and services.




“Cantor's relationships with innovative partners are key to unlocking unique opportunities, and we are proud of our role in this extraordinary collaboration between Tether, a foundation for today's digital asset ecosystem, and SoftBank, one of the world's preeminent investors,” said Brandon Lutnick, Chairman & CEO of Cantor Equity Partners, Inc. and Chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P. “With a visionary leader at the helm and backing from two renowned industry leaders, Twenty One is designed to help investors capture value from Bitcoin's growing global demand and increasing institutional adoption.”




Terms of the Transaction



Shares of Cantor Equity Partners will continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “CEP” until the closing of the Transaction. Twenty One will seek to trade after closing under the ticker symbol “XXI.”




The Board of Directors of each of Twenty One and CEP has unanimously approved the transaction. The transaction will require the approval of the shareholders of CEP and is subject to customary closing conditions.




The transaction values Twenty One at a pro-forma enterprise value of $3.6 billion, based on a Bitcoin spot price of $84,863.57 (a 10-day average CME CF BRRNY price) as of April 21, 2025. The transaction is expected to provide approximately $540 million in proceeds to Twenty One, including from a fully committed convertible senior secured notes PIPE of $385 million, convertible at $13.00 per share, a fully committed common equity PIPE of $200 million at $10.00 per share, and $100 million of cash held in the trust account of CEP, assuming no redemptions and prior to accounting for transaction expenses and interest accrued on the CEP trust account. Up to an additional $100 million of convertible senior secured notes may be purchased, at the investors' option (the “Convertible Notes Option”), within 30 days of the date hereof, which may generate additional proceeds.




Tether has also agreed to purchase Bitcoin in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the convertible senior secured notes and equity PIPE offerings, less transaction expenses and certain other amounts, within 10 business days of the date hereof, plus additional Bitcoin to the extent investors elect to exercise their Convertible Notes Option. This Bitcoin will then be purchased by Twenty One upon closing using the proceeds of the PIPE offerings at a purchase price equal to the amount paid by Tether for such Bitcoin.




Additional information about the Business Combination and the PIPE Offerings, including a copy of the business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) and investor presentations, will be available in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by CEP with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and at www.sec.gov.

Cantor Fitzgerald, a leading global financial services firm, is partnering with SoftBank, Tether, and Bitfinex to build a Bitcoin acquisition vehicle. The new venture will be called 21 Capital and is expected to raise $3B worth of Bitcoin from its partners – $1.5M from Tether, $900M from SoftBank, and $600M from Bitfinex. 

21 Capital looks to follow MicroStrategy's investing path, which saw a surge in market cap (all the way up to $91B) after shifting to Bitcoin.

Read on as we explore the details of this deal and what it could mean for the broader crypto market. We'll also suggest three of the best altcoins you can buy to ride $BTC's potential rally.

More About the Deal: Could it Help Push Bitcoin Above $100K?

Cantor's partners are scheduled to convert their $BTC investments (1 $BTC at $85K) into 21 Capital shares, which will each have a face value of $10.

The deal is still in its early stages, though, and there has been no official announcement yet. It's quite possible that the arrangement falls through or the terms change for the final deal. It's also worth noting that this isn't the first time Cantor has forayed into crypto. In November 2024, after the appointment of Trump as the president, plans emerged about a $BTC lending program with Tether that would allow people to borrow money with $BTC as collateral. 

Ever since Howard Lutnick stepped down from Cantor to join Trump's Commerce Department, the firm has been headed by Brandon and Kyle Lutnick (his sons) as Chairman and Executive VC.

The credit for a shift towards a more pro-crypto mindset goes to the ‘crypto president,' who has promised to make crypto mainstream in the US through positive regulations.

Bitcoin Hits New 7-Week High

For the first time since March 2, 2025, Bitcoin has breached the $93K level after it rose by more than 6.8% on Tuesday, April 22.

The king crypto jumped 1.56% within just one minute during this rally, from $91,969 to $93,405.



Michael Sullivan, a Bitcoin analyst, said, ‘This is the craziest one-minute candle I've ever seen on the Bitcoin chart.' Just a day earlier, more than $381.3M inflow was seen in the 11 US spot $BTC ETFs as well. Another analyst, ‘Ted,' believes that $BTC will eventually catch up with gold, which hit fresh lifetime highs only a few days ago. 

This comes after Trump said that the tariffs on China will eventually come down significantly and that he won't be removing Powell, the US Federal Reserve Chair.

With institutional momentum building – and Bitcoin hitting new highs on the back of deals like Cantor's 21 Capital – the stage is set for another full-scale bull run. And while $BTC might be the headliner, it's often the altcoins riding its wave that deliver the biggest returns.

That's why now is the time to explore three of the best low-cap coins to buy today if you're looking to ride the next phase of Bitcoin's rally.

1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Altcoin to Buy to Ride $BTC's Growth

If you're looking for a meme coin that can mimic (and even surpass) Bitcoin's growth trajectory without requiring a huge upfront investment, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is the best crypto to buy now. Especially as $BTCBULL is the ONLY crypto that airdrops free $BTC to its token holders.

Moreover, because these airdrops will take place every time Bitcoin smashes through a new milestone (like $150K, $200K, and $250K), we can expect BTC Bull Token to follow Bitcoin's coattails.



What's more, the project's developers have planned to follow a deflationary approach, which will further push $BTCBULL's price. Essentially, a part of the total $BTCBULL supply will be wiped off every time Bitcoin climbs up by another $25K in price. This creates artificial scarcity for the token, which, combined with rising $BTC prices, could inflate $BTCBULL's demand – and lastly, its price. 

To better understand BTC Bull Token's potential, take a look at our $BTCBULL price prediction. It suggests that the token could explode by nearly 400% and reach $0.0096 by 2026.

Don't miss out on Bitcoin's biggest cheerleader and buy $BTCBULL today! Even better, each token is priced at just $0.002475, seeing as the project is in presale (where it has raised nearly $5M).

2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Top New Altcoin Building First-Ever Solana L2

A Bitcoin rally would add further fuel to the recent resurgence of meme coins. Consequently, this would make Solana, i.e., the go-to blockchain for meme coins, the center of attraction.

As a result, Solana's most anticipated listing, Solaxy ($SOLX), which aims to solve the network's congestion and scalability issues, could become the next crypto to explode.



To achieve its lofty goal of revamping Solana, Solaxy will build the first-ever Layer-2 scaling protocol on the network. This will shoulder the burden on Solana's mainnet by offloading some of its transactions onto a sidechain. Furthermore, since $SOLX is compatible with both Ethereum and Solana (it's a multi-chain token), it will leverage the former's liquidity and the latter's speed to bring about the ultimate Solana revolution. 

One of the biggest reasons we've predicted Solaxy to gain over 12,000% and reach $0.20 by 2030 is its presale performance. With over $31M in presale funding, it's easily among the best crypto presales we've seen in recent times.

The presale is still on. You can get one token for just $0.001702. Check out our guide on how to buy Solaxy for more information.

3. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) – Best PolitiFi Altcoin to Get Right Now

Much of crypto's newfound life is down to the pro-crypto attitude of the newly appointed US president, Mr. Donald Trump.

Therefore, it's not only fair but also highly likely that his own meme coin, $TRUMP, is one of the biggest beneficiaries of a Bitcoin buying spree. There are early signs, too. $TRUMP is up over 17% in the last seven days, hinting at a reversal of sorts.



The token is currently priced at just $9.40, with recent price action suggesting that a long rally might be in store.

It's worth noting that $TRUMP's launch in January was one of the most monumental moments in crypto history, so it's not just any meme coin – it's a piece of history.

$TRUMP shot up by more than 12,000% overnight and became the fourth biggest meme coin by market capitalization in virtually seconds after its launch.

DYOR Before Buying the Best Altcoins

Investing in $BTC directly is admittedly the safest way to dip your toes in crypto. After all, there's a much higher likelihood that the king cryptocurrency will be trading higher in five years' time.

However, the same isn't true for even the best altcoins. Because of their high volatility (which is what gives them exploding potential, too, by the way), they can cause significant losses.

That's why we urge our readers to do their own research before investing. It'd also be sound if you only invested an amount you're comfortable losing.

Nearly $4 million in stolen cargo was   recovered by police in a case involving a South American crime ring  that looted coffee, tequila, shoes, body wash, pet food and bitcoin-mining computers.

Police arrested Oscar David Borrero-Manchola, 41, and Yonaiker Rafael Martinez-Ramos, 26,  in the theft, sale and movement of stolen cargo, the Los Angeles Police Department announced in a news release. 

Roughly $1.2 million worth of stolen goods was  found in storage unit facilities in the San Fernando Valley, where police found speakers, clothing and other items. Detectives were also able to intercept a shipment of stolen bitcoin-mining computers that was set to be loaded onto a plane bound for Hong Kong. 

The stolen computers were valued at $2.7 million, police said.

The investigation included various search warrants and other detective work from the Los Angeles Police Department's cargo theft unit, which worked with the Los Angeles Port Police, Union Pacific Police Department and Los Angeles World Airport Police. 

 California 

Crews of thieves who travel from Chile and other South American nations for the purpose of stealing jewels and luxury goods are not new in Los Angeles, authorities say, but such heists “are way, way up.”

Borrero-Manchola was arrested April 15 and booked into a Van Nuys jail on suspicion of receiving stolen property. He was released on his own recognizance the following day, according to jail records. He's due to appear in court  May 7.

Martinez-Ramos was arrested Sunday on a no-bail warrant by Glendale police. He's  in custody at Men's Central Jail and due to appear in court  Thursday.

The investigation remains active and more arrests could be announced, police said.

South American theft groups, also called burglary tourists, have arrived in the country on tourist visas and then targeted wealthy enclaves across California in recent years, according to law enforcement.

Four Colombian men were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary in May 2024 after a high-speed pursuit. One of the suspects allegedly threw out a Wi-Fi jammer during the pursuit, an electronic device used to disrupt home security cameras. 

In February, seven Chileans were charged with conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property after they allegedly broke in and stole valuables worth more than $2 million from the homes of professional athletes.

 Bitcoin ETFs recorded their highest inflows in over three months as investors regained confidence. 

Investments in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) rebounded to levels last seen in January, signaling a recovery in investor sentiment from concerns about global trade tariff escalations.

US spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs had over $912 million worth of cumulative net inflows on April 22, marking their highest daily investment in more than three months since Jan. 21, Farside Investors data shows.

“Bitcoin ETPs just saw the largest daily inflows since 21st January in a dramatic improvement in sentiment,” according to James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.

Related: Bitcoin still on track for $1.8M in 2035, says analyst

Investor sentiment appeared to improve after US President Donald Trump said that import tariffs on Chinese goods will “come down substantially,” adopting a softer tone in negotiations.

The de-escalation and growing ETF inflows pushed Bitcoin price above $93,000 for the first time in seven weeks, Cointelegraph reported on April 23.

The growing institutional investment and presence of ETFs may also accelerate the historic four-year cycle and bolster BTC to new highs before the end of 2025, analysts told Cointelegraph.

The US dollar's weakness may contribute to the growing investor demand for Bitcoin. 

The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the strength of the greenback against a basket of leading fiat currencies, has declined 9% since the beginning of 2025, touching a three-year low of 98.8 last seen in April 2022, TradingView data shows.

“Macro factors like a weakening dollar and rising gold correlation” may reinforce Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against economic volatility, Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, told Cointelegraph.

Related: Crypto, stocks enter ‘new phase of trade war' as US-China tensions rise

Crypto and traditional stock markets are “walking a tightrope between political drama and economic reality,” with Bitcoin staging a significant rebound thanks to “strong ETF inflows, institutional acquisitions, and a weakening US dollar,” according to Nexo dispatch analyst Iliya Kalchev:

“The conversation has clearly shifted. Bitcoin is no longer trading in the shadows of tech — it's becoming a lens through which macro uncertainty is priced,” he added.

Nansen CEO Alex Svanevik also praised Bitcoin's resilience, noting that the maturing asset has become “less Nasdaq — more gold” in the past two weeks, increasingly acting as a safe haven asset against economic turmoil, though concerns over economic recession may limit its price trajectory.

On April 21, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicted that this might be the “last chance” to buy Bitcoin below $100,000, as the incoming US Treasury buybacks may signal the next significant catalyst for Bitcoin price.

Vitalik Buterin will be stepping away from the day-to-day coordination of the Ethereum Foundation.

Tomasz K. Stanczak, the co-executive director of the foundation, says recent changes in leadership will free up the ETH co-creator's time “for research and exploration” rather than crisis response.

“Each time Vitalik shares insights or communicates a direction, he accelerates major long-term breakthroughs. His recent posts on RISC-V and zkVMs have advanced promising avenues, while his writing on privacy has helped realign the community around the Ethereum Foundation's core values. I want to make clear that Vitalik's proposals will always carry weight, but they are intended to start conversations and encourage progress in difficult research areas. Community review may refine them significantly or even reject them.”

Stanczak says the Ethereum Foundation's research effort will shift toward near-term goals like improving user experience and scaling.

“We are concentrating on Layer 1 scaling, support for Layer 2 scaling, and significant UX (user experience) improvements (including interoperability) in the Pectra, Fusaka, and Glamsterdam upgrades.

In parallel, we are exploring ways to bring forward projects that currently look three to five years away. Posts from our top researchers help some of them to ship within one or two years through initiatives such as next-generation execution and consensus layers.”

Crypto firm Galaxy Digital is executing an asset swap involving the native tokens of layer-1 blockchains Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), according to on-chain data.

Data from blockchain tracking platform Lookonchain suggests that Galaxy Digital has, over the past two weeks, sold Ethereum worth tens of millions of dollars and purchased Solana.

“In the past two weeks, Galaxy Digital deposited 65,600 ETH ($105.48 million) to Binance and withdrew 752,240 SOL ($98.37 million) from Binance.”

Galaxy Digital's portfolio reorganization is coming amid the firm's head of research, Alex Thorn, predicting that the US will purchase Bitcoin (BTC) this year to add to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) launched in March. According to Thorn, one of the options the US could exercise to purchase the flagship crypto asset in a budget-neutral way would be to swap confiscated altcoins into Bitcoin.

“To be specific, you could sell an altcoin in an altcoin/BTC pair and never touch cash at all. No cash ever has to flow into the [US] general treasury. Could be an easier way to get to a ‘promises made, promises kept' on the SBR.”

Ethereum is trading at $1,630 at time of writing, down by 67% from the all-time high reached in November of 2021. Solana is changing hands at $140 at time of writing, down by 52% from the record high hit in January.

Ethereum (ETH) is under pressure as it attempts to recover from one of its worst-performing years among major cryptocurrencies, down nearly 50% in 2025. Despite signs of improving momentum, with RSI climbing and EMA lines hinting at a potential breakout, ETH continues to lag behind competitors like Solana in multiple metrics. 

The ETH/BTC ratio has plunged to multi-year lows amid heavy institutional sell-offs. As ETH approaches key resistance, the market remains divided, with bulls eyeing a breakout and skeptics questioning the chain's long-term relevance.

Ethereum is currently the worst-performing major crypto asset in 2025, with its price down nearly 51% year-to-date, significantly underperforming Bitcoin (-5 %), Solana (-25.5 %), BNB (-13.5 %), and even XRP, which is up 1%.

This steep underperformance has sparked growing concerns about Ethereum's future, especially as alternative chains like Solana and Base continue to gain momentum. 

Solana is now leading the sector in key on-chain metrics such as DEX volume, apps revenue, and user activity, while Base is quickly capturing developer interest. 

As these competitors rise, Ethereum's dominance is being increasingly challenged across both narrative and usage, with some analysts even suggesting that XRP's market cap could soon surpass Ethereum's.

The ETH/BTC ratio has collapsed to 0.01791 — its lowest point since 2020 — highlighting the scale of Ethereum's decline relative to Bitcoin. 

This drop has been accelerated by major sell-offs from institutions, including Galaxy Digital, which offloaded over $100 million in ETH in just one week. The Ethereum Foundation and Paradigm have also made large-scale transfers, contributing to investor unease. Additionally, Solana recently surpassed Ethereum in Staking Market Cap. 

Compounding the issue are Ethereum's low staking rates and Bitcoin's growing dominance, both of which are shifting market sentiment and capital away from ETH. 

As a result, Ethereum's position as the leading smart contract platform is being questioned more seriously than ever before.

Ethereum's Relative Strength Index (RSI) has climbed to 57.26, up from 42.43 just a day ago, signaling a notable uptick in short-term momentum. 

The RSI is a technical indicator that measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate whether an asset is overbought or oversold. It ranges from 0 to 100, with values above 70 typically indicating overbought conditions and values below 30 pointing to oversold levels. 

Readings between 50 and 70 usually suggest moderate bullish momentum, while those between 30 and 50 lean bearish or neutral.

With ETH's RSI now at 57.26, the asset is in bullish-neutral territory. It shows improving momentum but is not yet strong enough to indicate overheating. 

Importantly, Ethereum hasn't seen an RSI reading above 70 since March 24 — nearly a month ago — which signals that despite the recent bounce, it hasn't entered overbought territory or shown signs of a sustained breakout. 

This suggests cautious optimism: while buyers are regaining control, Ethereum still lacks the aggressive momentum that typically drives significant price rallies. If the RSI continues to rise and breaks above 70, it could point to stronger bullish sentiment returning.

Ethereum's EMA lines are starting to show signs of a potential bullish reversal. The price is now approaching a key resistance level at $1,669. If that level breaks, Ethereum price could target $1,749 next. 

With strong momentum, it may even reach $1,954 — its first time above $1,900 since April 2. Short-term EMAs are moving closer to longer-term ones, a setup that supports this bullish outlook. Rising trading volume would further strengthen the case.

A successful breakout could help restore some investor confidence amid a challenging year for ETH.

However, skepticism around Ethereum's long-term positioning continues to grow within the crypto community, particularly as rival chains gain traction.

If ETH fails to maintain upward momentum, it could retest the $1,535 support zone. A breakdown below that level would shift the structure back to bearish, opening downside targets at $1,412 and potentially $1,385. 

In that scenario, Ethereum's inability to reclaim key levels could further fuel doubts about its competitive edge, especially in light of rising activity on faster and cheaper alternatives.

This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

Bitcoin (BTC) has finally surpassed a key resistance that limited recovery rallies earlier this year, after rising over 5% to $93,500 in 24 hours.

The leading digital asset by market value has topped the ""Ichimoku Cloud,"" confirming a bullish shift in momentum, while other major cryptocurrencies lag.

The Ichimoku cloud, developed by a Japanese journalist in the 1960s, is used to identify support and resistance, momentum, and trend change in price actions. The indicator comprises five lines: Leading Span A, Leading Span B, and the gap between the two representing the cloud, Conversion Line or Tenkan-Sen (T), Base Line or Kijun-Sen (K), and a lagging closing price line.

Crossovers above and below the cloud represent bullish and bearish shifts in the market trend, and BTC has moved above the cloud, as seen in the chart below.

The bullish breakout means the cloud can now act as support, arresting potential price pullbacks just as it acted as resistance, capping recovery rallies in February and March. BTC is also back to trading above the widely tracked 50-, 100-, and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs).

This move now puts the focus on the resistance at $100K, a major psychological level, followed by record highs above $109K. Meanwhile, support is seen at $88,550, which marks the convergence of the 200-day SMA and the Ichimoku cloud. 

A move below the same would negate the bullish outlook.

Major altcoins such as payments-focused XRP, leading meme token DOGE, Cardano's ADA, Ethereum's native token ETH, and Solana's SOL are yet to chart a BTC-like bullish breakout above the Ichimoku cloud.

The above coins, though buoyant alongside BTC's ascent, have yet to make their respective bullish breakouts.

21 Capital looks to follow MicroStrategy's investing path, which saw a surge in market cap (all the way up to $91B) after shifting to Bitcoin.

Read on as we explore the details of this deal and what it could mean for the broader crypto market. We'll also suggest three of the best altcoins you can buy to ride $BTC's potential rally.

More About the Deal: Could it Help Push Bitcoin Above $100K?

Cantor's partners are scheduled to convert their $BTC investments (1 $BTC at $85K) into 21 Capital shares, which will each have a face value of $10.

The deal is still in its early stages, though, and there has been no official announcement yet. It's quite possible that the arrangement falls through or the terms change for the final deal. It's also worth noting that this isn't the first time Cantor has forayed into crypto. In November 2024, after the appointment of Trump as the president, plans emerged about a $BTC lending program with Tether that would allow people to borrow money with $BTC as collateral. 

Ever since Howard Lutnick stepped down from Cantor to join Trump's Commerce Department, the firm has been headed by Brandon and Kyle Lutnick (his sons) as Chairman and Executive VC.

The credit for a shift towards a more pro-crypto mindset goes to the ‘crypto president,' who has promised to make crypto mainstream in the US through positive regulations.

Bitcoin Hits New 7-Week High

For the first time since March 2, 2025, Bitcoin has breached the $93K level after it rose by more than 6.8% on Tuesday, April 22.

The king crypto jumped 1.56% within just one minute during this rally, from $91,969 to $93,405.



Michael Sullivan, a Bitcoin analyst, said, ‘This is the craziest one-minute candle I've ever seen on the Bitcoin chart.' Just a day earlier, more than $381.3M inflow was seen in the 11 US spot $BTC ETFs as well. Another analyst, ‘Ted,' believes that $BTC will eventually catch up with gold, which hit fresh lifetime highs only a few days ago. 

This comes after Trump said that the tariffs on China will eventually come down significantly and that he won't be removing Powell, the US Federal Reserve Chair.

With institutional momentum building – and Bitcoin hitting new highs on the back of deals like Cantor's 21 Capital – the stage is set for another full-scale bull run. And while $BTC might be the headliner, it's often the altcoins riding its wave that deliver the biggest returns.

That's why now is the time to explore three of the best low-cap coins to buy today if you're looking to ride the next phase of Bitcoin's rally.

1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Altcoin to Buy to Ride $BTC's Growth

If you're looking for a meme coin that can mimic (and even surpass) Bitcoin's growth trajectory without requiring a huge upfront investment, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is the best crypto to buy now. Especially as $BTCBULL is the ONLY crypto that airdrops free $BTC to its token holders.

Moreover, because these airdrops will take place every time Bitcoin smashes through a new milestone (like $150K, $200K, and $250K), we can expect BTC Bull Token to follow Bitcoin's coattails.



What's more, the project's developers have planned to follow a deflationary approach, which will further push $BTCBULL's price. Essentially, a part of the total $BTCBULL supply will be wiped off every time Bitcoin climbs up by another $25K in price. This creates artificial scarcity for the token, which, combined with rising $BTC prices, could inflate $BTCBULL's demand – and lastly, its price. 

To better understand BTC Bull Token's potential, take a look at our $BTCBULL price prediction. It suggests that the token could explode by nearly 400% and reach $0.0096 by 2026.

Don't miss out on Bitcoin's biggest cheerleader and buy $BTCBULL today! Even better, each token is priced at just $0.002475, seeing as the project is in presale (where it has raised nearly $5M).

2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Top New Altcoin Building First-Ever Solana L2

A Bitcoin rally would add further fuel to the recent resurgence of meme coins. Consequently, this would make Solana, i.e., the go-to blockchain for meme coins, the center of attraction.

As a result, Solana's most anticipated listing, Solaxy ($SOLX), which aims to solve the network's congestion and scalability issues, could become the next crypto to explode.



To achieve its lofty goal of revamping Solana, Solaxy will build the first-ever Layer-2 scaling protocol on the network. This will shoulder the burden on Solana's mainnet by offloading some of its transactions onto a sidechain. Furthermore, since $SOLX is compatible with both Ethereum and Solana (it's a multi-chain token), it will leverage the former's liquidity and the latter's speed to bring about the ultimate Solana revolution. 

One of the biggest reasons we've predicted Solaxy to gain over 12,000% and reach $0.20 by 2030 is its presale performance. With over $31M in presale funding, it's easily among the best crypto presales we've seen in recent times.

The presale is still on. You can get one token for just $0.001702. Check out our guide on how to buy Solaxy for more information.

3. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) – Best PolitiFi Altcoin to Get Right Now

Much of crypto's newfound life is down to the pro-crypto attitude of the newly appointed US president, Mr. Donald Trump.

Therefore, it's not only fair but also highly likely that his own meme coin, $TRUMP, is one of the biggest beneficiaries of a Bitcoin buying spree. There are early signs, too. $TRUMP is up over 17% in the last seven days, hinting at a reversal of sorts.



The token is currently priced at just $9.40, with recent price action suggesting that a long rally might be in store.

It's worth noting that $TRUMP's launch in January was one of the most monumental moments in crypto history, so it's not just any meme coin – it's a piece of history.

$TRUMP shot up by more than 12,000% overnight and became the fourth biggest meme coin by market capitalization in virtually seconds after its launch.

DYOR Before Buying the Best Altcoins

Investing in $BTC directly is admittedly the safest way to dip your toes in crypto. After all, there's a much higher likelihood that the king cryptocurrency will be trading higher in five years' time.

However, the same isn't true for even the best altcoins. Because of their high volatility (which is what gives them exploding potential, too, by the way), they can cause significant losses.

That's why we urge our readers to do their own research before investing. It'd also be sound if you only invested an amount you're comfortable losing.

The crypto market has started to show strong signs of a bull run for the first time since late January, with many catalysts driving the upward momentum.

Bitcoin     

BTC
$93 668



24h volatility:
3.2%


Market cap:
$1.86 T



Vol. 24h:
$52.79 B



	 and the broader altcoin market started to see increased gains on Tuesday, April 22, as both fundamental indicators and macro conditions turned in favor of financial markets.

Bitcoin rose by 6.5% to a six-week high of $94,000. Its market dominance reached 63.4% — market cap sitting at $1.85 trillion — for the first time since January 2021. This suggests that Bitcoin's bullish momentum was a key driver for the altcoin ecosystem.





According to data from SoSoValue, the US-based spot BTC exchange-traded funds recorded a net inflow of $936.4 million, led by ARKB's $267.1 million inflows, on April 22. This was the seventh-largest daily inflow into the Bitcoin-based investment products.

Ethereum     

ETH
$1 794



24h volatility:
5.9%


Market cap:
$216.52 B



Vol. 24h:
$26.17 B



	 also saw a $38 million net inflow into its US-based spot ETFs for the first time since Feb. 4, SoSoValue data shows.

The leading altcoin gained 14% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $1,800. ETH has been showing bullish signals over the past week as whales started to accumulate the asset.

According to CoinMarketCap data, the global crypto market capitalization increased by 7% to $2.94 trillion, with a daily trading volume of $134 billion.

The CMC fear and greed index also recorded a sudden spike above the 50 mark, showing increased investor confidence in the asset class.

The reason why the crypto market is seeing a strong buying spree, similar to the November 2024 elections, is a combination of micro and macro catalysts.

Whale accumulation acted as one of the key drivers. Coinspeaker reported that large holders have been buying leading assets like Ethereum, Solana 

SOL
$151.4



24h volatility:
4.5%


Market cap:
$78.35 B



Vol. 24h:
$6.26 B



	, and Dogecoin 

DOGE
$0.18



24h volatility:
4.2%


Market cap:
$26.58 B



Vol. 24h:
$2.24 B



	, to name a few.

It's important to note Strategy's $555 million Bitcoin purchase on April 21.

The daily crypto liquidations also skyrocketed to $629 million, $74 million longs and $555 million shorts, according to CoinGlass data. Historically, short liquidations push the prices higher.

Most notably, the increased investor confidence in the financial markets has been reinforced after US President Donald Trump announced that the 145% tariffs on China will likely fall.

According to The Hill, Trump expressed optimism, saying that “It [tariffs] won't be that high”.

Yuga Labs has filed a turnover order in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, in an effort to seize crypto assets held by influencer Jeremy Cahen, also known online as Pauly0x.

The assets, spread across four wallets, include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and PEPE coin, and total nearly $400,000 as of last October.

Yuga Labs sued Cahen and artist Ryder Ripps in July 2022 for infringing on Yuga Labs' trademark through the sale of the Ryder Ripps Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection. 

Ripps had launched the copycat project in May 2022 as a form of “parody” and protest, claiming Bored Ape NFTs featured hidden Nazi and racist imagery. 

The court sided with Yuga, awarding it over $1.5 million in damages in October 2023. The following February, this increased to nearly $9 million in total, including $7 million in attorneys' fees and post-judgment interest.

The final judgment, entered on February 2, 2024, became enforceable by March 3. Cahen has not posted a bond or obtained a stay of enforcement, which has allowed Yuga Labs to begin post-judgment asset recovery.

The company has since subpoenaed Cahen's accountant and served levies—delivered by U.S. Marshals—on banks and crypto platforms including Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo, Robinhood, Coinbase, Binance, and Gemini.

“Yuga Labs has taken affirmative steps under California law, essentially every month since the Court issued its Final Judgment to locate and execute upon Cahen's assets,"" the company said in its most recent filing. 

""Still, Cahen has made a mockery of this Court's Final Judgement by refusing to pay any portion of the judgment or comply with any post-judgment discovery.”

Court records show Cahen moved $396,946 in crypto to avoid a levy served to Gemini. According to Yuga, this transfer occurred one day after the levy was issued—before Gemini could freeze his accounts—suggesting a deliberate effort to evade asset seizure.

Gemini, in response to a subpoena, provided transaction records from Cahen's account, showing that he moved crypto into two new wallets.

Cahen maintains that he is not obligated to comply with discovery requests while his appeal is pending, despite lacking a formal stay. Cahen, who has promoted various meme coins and been accused of being a scammer, branded himself “the most censored man on X” following the suspension of his account last year.

Puerto Rican authorities confirmed in February that Cahen is wanted for aggravated assault. In February, he was placed on the top 10 most wanted list in San Juan, the island's capital. His current project, a DEX called Pond0X, has been called a scam by critics.

The court has not yet ruled on Yuga Labs' turnover motion. Decrypt has approached Cahen for comment via Instagram.

The non-fungible token (NFT) sector experienced explosive growth in 2021. Artists, investors, and collectors were all swept up in the frenzy. Yet, its meteoric rise was followed by a downturn, prompting questions about the sector's sustainability.

Alexander Salnikov, co-founder of Rarible, believes the market is not facing a collapse but rather a shift. In an exclusive interview with BeInCrypto, Salnikov offered his perspective on the state of NFTs in 2025 and their role moving forward.

The rise of NFTs, fueled by excitement and speculation, was inevitable for a market experiencing such rapid innovation. Nonetheless, like many emerging technologies, this early surge was followed by a correction. The hype gave way to the realities of market maturation and sustainability.

According to the latest report by DappRadar, the art NFT market saw an impressive surge in 2021, with trading volumes reaching $2.9 billion. However, by the first quarter of 2025, the trading volume was recorded at just $23.8 million, marking a 93% decline.

Similarly, the number of active traders peaked at a record high of 529,101 in 2022. Yet, this figure sharply declined by 96%, with just 19,575 active traders remaining by Q1 2025. 

A previous industry report from DappRadar revealed that the underwhelming performance wasn't just a trend in 2025. In fact, 2024 was one of the worst-performing years for the NFT market since 2020. In addition, BeInCrypto also reported on a study that revealed 98% of NFT projects launched in 2024 were essentially “dead.” 

Despite the decline, Rarible's Salnikov has maintained a positive outlook for the sector. He emphasized the importance of a clear purpose when it comes to NFTs. 

“Once upon a time, after the .com burst, the headlines rang that the internet was only a fad. But as more companies integrated the technology into everyday use cases, it became ingrained as a part of life,” he told BeInCrypto.

Salnikov argued that trust quickly diminishes when NFTs are viewed merely as speculative assets. In contrast, projects rooted in real community engagement or providing tangible utility offer clear value, making their worth easily understood. 

Meanwhile, rather than viewing the sector's decline as a collapse, the executive sees it as a market recalibration, with the focus shifting away from speculative hype toward projects with more sustainable value. 

“The speculative phase had its moment, but now we're watching NFTs evolve into actual infrastructure—tools creators use to build communities, products, and new digital economies,” he said.

Salnikov stressed that utility in the NFT space is no longer a distant concept—it is happening right now. Creators are using NFTs for membership, brands for loyalty programs, and games for player identity. 

He pointed to a growing convergence between the digital and physical worlds, with NFTs being tied to merchandise, events, and even real-world assets. Binance Research's April 2025 report further corroborates this trend. 

The report spotlighted several real-world partnerships, indicating interest in NFTs. Examples include Azuki's physical-backed NFT with Michael Lau, The Sandbox's Jurassic World collaboration, EGGRYPTO's anime characters with Eparida, and Sony's Soneium platform partnering with LINE to create Web3 mini-apps.

“The next wave of growth isn't about chasing a trend—it's about unlocking new types of ownership and access that feel native to the internet generation,” noted Salnikov.

While this perspective offers optimism, the reality for many companies is quite different. Due to low trading volumes, major platforms like Bybit, X2Y2, and Kraken have resorted to discontinuing their NFT services. 

Those that didn't shut down explored alternative avenues. For instance, Magic Eden expanded beyond NFTs with the acquisition of Slingshot. Nevertheless, Salnikov dismissed this strategy, commenting,

“We're not trying to bolt on non-NFT features just to stay busy—we're building NFT commerce that actually fits the communities using it.”

He explained that this approach uses modular, customizable on-chain marketplaces. Creators can tailor them to fit their specific audiences, whether it's a gaming project, an L3, or a legacy brand.

“NFTs are the feature—they just need the right framing,” the Rarible co-founder stated.

Going back, an interesting trend during the NFT hype era was the involvement of celebrities. High-profile figures like Justin Bieber, Madonna, and Neymar jumped on the bandwagon, attracting substantial attention to the sector. Nonetheless, their investment strategies haven't fared particularly well.

In January 2022, Bieber spent 500 ETH (approximately $1.3 million at the time) on Bored Ape #3001. This NFT is from Yuga Labs' Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection. 

However, according to the latest data, the NFT is worth only 13.51 WETH (around $24,174), a decline of 98.1%. Although the singer hasn't sold his NFT, it has received little attention lately, with no promotional efforts or notable discussions around it.

Thus, while celebrities can bring attention to NFTs, this highlights the need for substance beyond the name itself. As Salnikov pointed out, celebrity involvement in the sector is fleeting. 

According to him, a celebrity name alone can't replace genuine creative direction or a strong community.

“Celebrity drops will come and go—it's the culture behind them that determines if they stick,” he remarked.

He argued that celebrities treating NFTs as mere merchandise deters audiences. Nevertheless, when an NFT drop is intentional and truly taps into something meaningful like music, fashion, or fandom, that's where the lasting value is found.

“We're way more interested in working with creators who are building for the long haul than just chasing headlines,” Salnikov disclosed to BeInCrypto.

The executive also outlined the need for a more accessible and user-friendly approach for attracting interested users. He detailed that onboarding users should not feel “like a tech demo.” Salnikov pointed to Rarible as an example. 

According to him, Rarible focuses on ensuring that each marketplace built on its platform is a product people genuinely want to use. This involves features such as fiat onramps, low-cost mints, a clean user interface, and, most importantly, content that resonates with users. 

“We're not selling NFTs—we're powering experiences that just happen to be onchain,” Salnikov concluded.

While the NFT market faces ongoing challenges, it remains to be seen whether the industry is entering a new phase of growth or if further obstacles lie ahead in its evolution.

Pump Fun co-founder Dylan Kerler has been linked to a number of shitcoin rugpulls that extracted $75,000 from unsuspecting investors when he was just 16.

WIRED reportedly discovered that a developer using Dylan Kerler's name launched eight coins in 2017. Two of these, eBitcoinCash and EthereumCash, reportedly made the developer $75,000 in Ether (ETH), worth $400,000 today.

The developer promoted these two coins in the BitcoinTalk forum, making numerous promises and generating enough interest to raise EthereumCash's value to £1.3 million.

However, WIRED reports that they began selling their EthereumCash holdings in secret, which coincided with an 88% drop in value. They used EtherDelta to sell, making 240 ETH, before dividing it across various wallets on centralized exchanges.  

Certik's chief security scientist said, “We strongly suspect that [EthereumCash] was used by the developer for a rug pull.”

Both coins were promoted by one person, using the accounts DOMAINBROKER and ninjagod.

In one instance, DOMAINBROKER shared a personal email address with the name Dylan Kerler, while ninjagod launched a thread that referred to Kerler as the developer of EthereumCash. 

This developer also claimed in a Telegram group that they're based in the UK city of Brighton. Pump Fun's co-founder is also listed on the electoral records as having an address in the area, and a Pump Fun entity uses this address in its corporate filings.

A coin called Equis that was promoted by ninjagod on BitcoinTalk also shares identical code to EthereumCash and was featured on a YouTube account using Dylan Kerlar's name.

Neither Pump Fun nor Kerler responded to WIRED's request for comment. Protos has reached out to Alon Cohen, Pump Fun's co-founder, for comment and will update this article if we hear anything back.

Solana-based meme coins are experiencing significant growth, driving increased interest in Solaxy, a Layer 2 solution designed to tackle scalability issues.

Having raised over $31 million in its ICO, Solaxy is focused on improving transaction speeds and reducing network congestion on Solana.

As meme coin activity continues to rise, Solaxy's infrastructure upgrade will play a crucial role in supporting Solana's long-term growth. With strong community backing, Solaxy is rapidly becoming an essential component of Solana's future.

Summary

The broader cryptocurrency market, particularly meme coins, is experiencing a strong resurgence. With a collective market cap hitting approximately $54 billion (a 10% increase), meme coins are surging.

This rally is matched by a dramatic ~96% increase in trading volume, signaling robust market engagement and strong speculative interest.

Among today's top performers are meme coins built on the Solana blockchain, which are clearly leading the charge. Solana itself is showing impressive strength, up 7% on the day and currently trading at $158.

This bullish momentum is spilling over into Solana-based meme tokens, many of which are seeing significant gains.

Fartcoin is up nearly 8%, SPX6900 has surged by 14%, and Dogwifhat has posted an impressive 26% gain on the day, bringing its weekly performance to a remarkable 52%.

Other notable meme coins on Solana include PENGU, which has soared 32%, and Popcat (SOL), up 19%. MELANIA has also joined the rally, while TRUMP has seen an 11% increase, further reflecting the growing optimism within the meme coin space.

What makes this rally particularly noteworthy is that it's happening despite a backdrop of market fear. Even as caution lingers, investors are increasingly embracing speculative assets — a sign that confidence in a broader market rebound may be returning.

Meme coins, especially those built on Solana, are taking the lead and could signal the early stages of a major breakout across both the Solana ecosystem and the meme coin sector.

Solana-based meme coins are performing exceptionally well, hinting at renewed interest from retail investors.

Their surge suggests that sentiment among risk-tolerant traders is shifting — many believe the worst is over and are positioning themselves early in hopes of outsized returns during a potential bull run.

However, this renewed momentum comes with growing pressure on Solana's infrastructure. As trading volumes spike and meme coin activity intensifies, concerns about network congestion are resurfacing — a persistent challenge during periods of high demand.

Addressing this scalability issue is essential for sustaining long-term growth, and that's exactly where Solaxy enters the picture.

Source – Solaxy Twitter

A new Layer 2 blockchain solution built specifically to scale the Solana network, Solaxy is emerging as a key infrastructure upgrade aimed at reducing congestion and ensuring smoother performance.

The project has already raised an impressive $31.2 million during its ongoing ICO — a remarkable feat given current market conditions.

Unlike many hype-driven projects, Solaxy is launching during a bear cycle, suggesting it may be backed by strong fundamentals and real-world utility.

As Solana continues to see rising adoption from meme coin developers and future dApps, the demand for Layer 2 scalability becomes critical.

Solaxy is positioning itself to meet that demand — enhancing transaction speeds, lowering costs, and reinforcing Solana's high-performance architecture.

The Solaxy project is also backed by an active and growing community. Its official X (formerly Twitter) account has already attracted 60,000+ followers, signaling strong grassroots support and anticipation.

Investors interested in joining can purchase the Solaxy token via credit card or cryptocurrency. The process is user-friendly, requiring only a wallet connection — with Best Wallet being one of the preferred options.

Once connected, users simply select the amount they wish to invest, and the tokens will be available to claim upon launch. This streamlined approach makes Solaxy accessible to both crypto veterans and new investors alike.

With meme coins driving renewed attention and Solana at the center of it, Solaxy could become one of the most important tokens of the next market cycle.

Its role as a Layer 2 solution is not just a value add — it could be a necessity if Solana's popularity continues to surge. As congestion rises, so will demand for scalable infrastructure, and Solaxy is positioning itself as the answer.

Investors now face a choice: participate early in a potentially critical piece of Solana's future or wait on the sidelines and risk missing out on the momentum. As meme coin mania heats up and blockchain usage surges, the case for Solaxy becomes increasingly compelling.

The ICO routinely carries out audits to ensure that organisations comply with data protection law.

Derby City Council has been officially recognised for its hard work to keep residents' and customers' data safe.

During a recent routine audit, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) - the Government body which makes sure organisations comply with data protection law - praised the Council for its high assurance ratings in keeping resident's data secure.

The ICO assesses potential risks to data security and the likely impact, considering an organisation's structure, concerns raised by the ICO or the Council, and risks which affect the sector more widely.

The recent audit focused on three areas: governance and accountability, cyber security, and personal data breach management and reporting.

Commenting on the personal data breach management and reporting category, the report noted:

Derby City Council has demonstrated a strong communication structure with IG (Information Governance) being communicated through multiple channels with effective messaging. This has led to a strong privacy culture, as demonstrated through staff engagement in drop-in sessions and the volume of queries received by the IG team.

Councillor Kathy Kozlowski, Cabinet Member for Governance and Finance said:

Ensuring that our resident's and customer's data is kept safe and secure is very important to us and I'm pleased that the ICO's recent audit reflects our commitment to excellence in this area.

A big thank you to all our colleagues who work hard to ensure that the appropriate processes and practices are in place and followed correctly. Our teams are reviewing the feedback and looking at areas for further improvement to ensure that we can maintain these high standards.

Our residents can be confident that the information that they share with us is shared in confidence.”

Several recommendations were also made to support the Council to improve their practices. These are being reviewed by the Council's Information Governance team and will be implemented over the coming months.

The full report is available to view on the Information Commissioner's Office website.

The Bank of England has published its latest technical update on preparations for the potential launch of a digital pound, focused on the challenges of offline payments.

A decision has yet to be made on whether to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the UK but the BoE, like many similar authorities worldwide, been exploring how to create what has been described as a ‘major national infrastructure project.'

The BoE described offline payments as ‘one of the most complicated elements of a potential UK CBDC' two-and-a-half years ago, explaining in a procurement notice (for developing a proof-of-concept and doing research) that offline payments ‘could increase acceptance and resilience of CBDC but heighten the risk of double spend as there is no online connectivity to verify the provenance of the money.'

Despite its latest experimentation, offline payments continue to remain a head-scratcher for the authority's CBDC team. ‘This project demonstrated that while it might be technically feasible to implement an offline payment functionality for a digital pound, there are trade-offs, particularly around user experience and preventing double spending and counterfeiting, that make implementing it challenging,' the BoE states in its ‘Digital pound experiment report: Offline payments'.

The BoE's latest experimentation involved work with five different private companies and explored four solutions. It demonstrated that ‘several' technology choices exist that could be made for offline payments but they are dependent on policy choices such as ‘risk appetite, product proposition and liability, which impact the options available for mitigating security risks,' the BoE summarises.

RELATED ARTICLE No ‘one-size-fits-all' solution for offline CBDC payments: BIS handbook – a news article (11 May 2023) on a 119-page handbook produced by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub in partnership with Consult Hyperion (one of the companies engaged by the BoE for the experimentation this news article is about – see below)

The BoE and HM Treasury (HMT) are currently in a ‘design phase' for a potential digital pound during which they aim to establish a ‘clear proposition' for a UK CBDC. A digital pound would only be introduced with Parliament's approval and would need primary legislation.

The central bank defines ‘offline payment' as a payment that occurs while neither payer nor payee has access to the CBDC network, ‘usually due to the lack of an internet connection.'

In its latest experimentation, the BoE worked with Thales, Secretarium, IDEMIA Secure Transactions, Quali-Sign and Consult Hyperion to assess different offline payment solutions. Thales UK had previously been awarded a contract, valued at £100,620 (about $134,000), from January 2023 to May 2023 to deliver a ‘CBDC Proof of Concept and Research of Offline Payments' (according to contract award notice published in April 2023 and previously reported by Global Government Fintech).

All solutions explored ‘achieved final and irrevocable payments (from a technology perspective) by transferring funds from the payer to the payee with immediate confirmation and settlement, enabling the payee to spend those funds immediately without having to reconnect to the network,' the BoE states in the 10 April update, explaining that ‘this is often referred to as “device” offline payments.' Other approaches exist that could also be explored, the authority adds.

The central bank points out that it explored offline payments from a technology perspective only. Other factors – such as policy, operational, legal (‘including but not limited, to the finality and irrevocability of payments from a legal perspective') and commercial considerations – will ‘need to be' explored, it continues, adding that ‘further work is required before design decisions can be made.'

In the same way that a decision has yet to be taken to launch a UK CBDC at all, a final decision has also not been taken on whether offline payment functionality would be implemented. A decision has been promised ‘around the middle of the decade' – so, imminently – on whether to build a digital pound.

RELATED ARTICLE BoE publishes findings on point-of-sale testing for digital pound payments – a news story (2 June 2024) on experimentation testing the technical feasibility of using point-of-sale (POS) hardware, as currently used in the UK, for potential CBDC payments

An 86-page BoE ‘Digital pound: technology working paper', published just over two years ago (February 2023), contained a section on considerations related to offline payments.

A 33-page ‘Response to the digital pound technology working paper', published 15 months ago (January 2024), recorded that offline functionality ‘was generally deemed to be important'. The two main reasons given were to support financial and digital inclusion, and to enhance resilience in the case of system outages. The working paper had noted that ‘the small number of respondents who did not deem offline functionality important cited security, fraud and financial crime as the reasons.'

The four solutions explored in this latest offline payments experimentation used different technologies to implement peer-to-peer and person-to-business offline payments.

‘Online reconciliation was used as a fallback security measure in all four solutions to detect counterfeiting and double spending,' the report states. ‘Being retrospective, online reconciliation helped to detect and identify counterfeiting and double spending, but it could not prevent either. At the point at which online reconciliation happens, users would have already suffered losses.'

‘Additional countermeasures had an impact on user experience and costs,' the report continues. ‘Measures such as risk mitigation limits had a negative impact on user experience since they prevented users from making further payments offline, often unexpectedly. There might also be financial inclusion impacts since more expensive, higher-end devices were needed to guarantee stronger security.'

RELATED ARTICLE UK CBDC architects warned against creating ‘expensive infrastructure that no-one uses' – a report (21 March 2024) from a panel session titled ‘Stablecoins and CBDCs – what will be their impact on the payments industry?' at last year's ‘Pay360' conference in London

The technology working paper stated that offline risk mitigation limits, whether on the number of consecutive offline transactions or based on time or value, might help to reduce the scale and impact of double spending.

The offline solutions assessed in this latest experimentation implemented different risk mitigation limits. Those limits included: maximum number of consecutive transactions offline; maximum offline payment amount; maximum cumulative amount for offline transactions; and maximum amount of offline balance stored.

The BoE reports, however, that ‘challenges […] arose when implementing those limits'. It explains: ‘For example, time-based limits were difficult to implement on the smart cards since those devices did not have an internal clock. But even on devices with an internal clock, for example smartphones, security concerns around trusting the clocks made time-based limits challenging to implement.'

‘We also observed potential user experience issues,' the BoE continues. ‘For example, we needed to consider how limits would be communicated to users and whether incoming or outgoing payments would be processed when the limits were reached. Further, these limits relied on the secure element for enforcement and needed to take account of the storage constraints of the secure elements. If the secure elements were breached, those limits could also be breached.'

NFC (Near-Field Communication – short-range wireless technology) was explored. It proved ‘useful' for card-to-phone and phone-to-card payments but ‘limited the amount of data that could be shared between payer and payee during a transaction' and ‘revealed user experience issues.'

RELATED ARTICLE Bank of England focuses on offline payments in CBDC proof-of-concept – a news story (21 October 2022) on previous BoE use of external expertise for a project exploring the possibilities and challenges of offline CBDC payments

The report summarises the BoE's current perspective by stating that offline CBDC ‘would be an innovative feature with potential to support different policy goals, such as resilience or financial inclusion'. But it warns that ‘heavy reliance on secure elements meant that if the secure elements were breached, double spending and counterfeiting might occur.'

‘Secure elements are commonly used in payments today, but they are, in most cases, paired with immediate online authentication, thus limiting losses,' the central bank explains. ‘In contrast, the online layer in an offline payment (online reconciliation) occurs only after the transaction has taken place and losses have already been incurred.'

‘Our policy work on offline digital pound payments is ongoing,' the report concludes, adding that the central bank ‘expect[s] to conduct a policy assessment to determine what these findings might mean for a digital pound.' It also points out that other technical-related challenges exist that were not addressed in the project, such as what happens to offline funds if a user loses their device.

The BoE kicked off 2025 on the CBDC front by reveals plans to create a ‘Digital Pound Lab' as a ‘technology sandbox environment [to] enable hands-on experimentation' through which it will test application programming interface (API) functionality, ‘innovative use cases', and potential business models for payment interface providers (PIPs) and external service interface providers (ESIPs). The Lab is expected to run from August 2025 to July 2026, with its activities split into two phases (applications to participate in the first phase are open to 6 June 2025).

In a separate recent CBDC-related development, the central bank has also this month (April) published a ‘preliminary conceptual framework' for a digital pound ‘rulebook'.

The BoE's head of digital pound Diana Carrasco took up the role almost 18 months ago, having joined from Lloyds Banking Group. She has also previously worked at HSBC and Visa, among other companies.

              Highlights            



                        With digital assets gaining legitimacy, there's growing strategic interest from major institutions, with regulation seen not as a barrier but as a catalyst for innovation.                      


                        The U.S. government is moving away from a confrontational, enforcement-heavy stance on crypto and blockchain toward a more balanced regulatory posture, signaling support for compliance and innovation.                      


                        As clearer frameworks emerge, there may be a split in the crypto space between companies that embrace regulation and those that operate outside it, with fewer operating in legal gray zones.                      

The U.S. government's evolving approach to crypto regulation could mark a pivotal moment for payments innovation.

“There's certainly a change in how the administration views the digital assets industry,” Dan Boyle, partner at Boies Schiller Flexner, told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster. “This is not a confrontational posture.”

Until recently, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) operated under what many in the industry perceived as a “regulation by prosecution” doctrine, aggressively pursuing high-profile crypto cases while offering little regulatory guidance. But the DOJ's recent decision to pivot away from that stance, paired with growing bipartisan support for proposed frameworks for stablecoin regulation, signals a reimagining of how Washington approaches cryptocurrency oversight.

Boyle, who's seen the cryptocurrency conversation from both the prosecutor's desk and the defense table, believes that despite headline-making changes, crypto companies would be mistaken to interpret this as a green light to let down their guard.

“This shouldn't be seen as a get out of jail free card. It's just a change in posture and market participants have to recognize that,” he said.

Rather, it's a pragmatic acknowledgment that blanket hostility doesn't help to foster compliance or innovation. And as compliance improves among major exchanges and stablecoin issuers, Boyle anticipates a divergence within the crypto ecosystem.

“You're going to see a divide between some companies which become compliant and others that want to stay outside of it,” he said. “You'll just see less in the gray area.”

In other words, when it comes to cryptocurrency, sunlight may be the best disinfectant.

Crypto's global reach has created a cat-and-mouse game between innovation and illicit activity. From cross-border scams to unregulated online marketplaces, the challenge for regulators is to protect consumers without stifling progress. For many in the industry, the DOJ's shift has introduced a new dilemma: where to refocus compliance efforts, and whether the enforcement risk has truly declined.

While enforcement risk remains, the GENIUS Act has emerged as a beacon of hope for crypto firms seeking clarity. If passed, it would be the first comprehensive U.S. framework for regulating stablecoins, a digital asset class often used as an off-ramp for criminal funds but increasingly embraced by mainstream financial institutions.

“The obvious growth in stablecoins and the fact that you have a lot of issuers ready to be fully compliant. It's a hard argument for Congress to ignore,” Boyle said.

Yet not all stablecoins are created equal. Criminal organizations continue to exploit the flexibility and speed of stablecoins, particularly when issued outside the bounds of U.S. regulation.

“Even if stablecoins are the preferred medium for a lot of criminal activity, creating a regulated environment where these companies can operate in conjunction with law enforcement is probably a positive,” Boyle said.

His advice is to align with what is known: the administration's enforcement focus, recent executive orders and global geopolitical shifts. That means preparing for scrutiny around transactions linked to Venezuela, Iran or known cartels. It also means considering proactive disclosure if risky activity is detected.

“Your risk has gone up higher,” Boyle said bluntly. “You're going to have states and foreign regulators that still care about things like foreign bribery and kleptocracy. Those haven't gone away.”

The current administration, in Boyle's view, sees crypto not as a fad but as a lasting part of the financial ecosystem. And that opens the door for large enterprises that were previously sitting on the sidelines to explore partnerships, issue stablecoins or tokenize real-world assets.

“When you look at how the prior administration just kind of viewed [crypto] as an area that wasn't particularly compliant … now there's going to be a lot of freedom to develop new technology,” he said. “There's some strategic value to being a world leader in digital assets … If my competitor is issuing a stablecoin or tokenizing assets, am I missing out if I don't?”

Crypto is no longer an outsider technology. It's moving into the mainstream, with all the legal, strategic and ethical responsibilities that entails. Still, the future could hinge on one crucial thing: defining what digital assets even are. After all, as Webster noted, if you ask 10 people what a digital asset is, you'll get 15 different answers.

Boyle agreed, adding that, “even now, whatever definition we might come up with today, that may be obsolete in three to six months … Perhaps having more participants in the area is going to help us all understand what the scope of the category should be.”

Ultimately, for companies navigating crypto's uncertain terrain, Boyle offered these final words of advice: don't let your guard down, but don't sit it out.

“It is a catalyst for innovation,” he said. “And there's a lane now for companies who want to do it right.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Report: ING Working on Stablecoin Project With Other Banks","https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2025/report-ing-working-on-stablecoin-project-with-other-banks/","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 00:58:59 GMT","

ING is reportedly working on a stablecoin project with other banks and crypto service providers.

The Dutch bank launched the project after the implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation last year created an opportunity to issue regulated stablecoins in the European Union (EU), CoinDesk reported Tuesday (April 22), citing unnamed sources.

Reached by PYMNTS, ING declined to comment on the report.

The EU's implementation of MiCA's provision for stablecoins put the EU at the forefront of crypto regulation, PYMNTS reported in July.

Having stricter disclosure requirements, regular audits of crypto firms and more robust capital reserve requirements will provide the regulatory clarity crypto and Web3 firms had been asking for and help build trust and transparency across the marketplace.

French bank Societe Generale opened its euro-backed stablecoin to retail investors in 2024, PYMNTS reported in December.

The bank's integrated and regulated subsidiary, Societe Generale-Forge said in July that it updated its EUR CoinVertible (EURCV) stablecoin to comply with the MiCA regulation and allow its widespread adoption and distribution.

“Robust and regulated stablecoins are essential to the proper functioning, security and institutionalization of crypto-asset markets,” Societe Generale-Forge CEO Jean-Marc Stenger said in a July 1 press release. “With EUR CoinVertible, and the implementation of the European MiCA regulation, SG-Forge is strengthening its offering to crypto ecosystems while continuing to develop innovative cross-border settlement and payment solutions based on blockchain technology for its corporate and financial institution clients.”

Stablecoin issuer Circle said in July that it attained an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license from the French banking authority, thereby achieving compliance with the MiCA regulatory framework and enabling it to issue USDC and EURC stablecoins in compliance with MiCA's regulatory obligations for stablecoins or eMoney tokens.

Circle CEO and Co-founder Jeremy Allaire said in a July 1 press release that the achievement is “a huge milestone in bringing digital currency into mainstream scale and acceptance.”

“By working closely with French and EU regulators, we are now able to offer both USDC and EURC as fully compliant dollar and euro stablecoins to the European market, unlocking the enormous potential of digital assets to transform finance and commerce.”

On February 27, 2025, the US Securities and Exchange
Commission's (SEC) Division of Corporation Finance issued
a 
staff statement (the Statement) clarifying that
“meme coins” will generally not be classified as
securities under federal law. The SEC determined that meme coins do
not typically meet the definition of security under the test
established in SEC v WJ Howey
Co,1 the leading jurisprudence for determining
what constitutes a security, meaning they would not fall under the
SEC's jurisdiction. Although staff statements are not
official rules or regulations, this announcement signals a
potential shift in the SEC's approach to the regulation of
celebrity-endorsed crypto asset ventures, which often involve the
endorsement of meme coins.

Celebrity-endorsed crypto asset ventures promise significant
returns through leveraging the influence of well-known figures to
attract investors. Such endorsements have proven to be an effective
means to enhance the credibility of crypto assets, but had
previously captured the SEC's attention given concerns of
celebrities and social media influencers promoting crypto asset
offerings that are not compliant with existing securities laws.
Scrutiny increased in light of the 
collapse of FTX Trading Ltd. — a once $32 billion
dollar2 crypto asset exchange that was endorsed by
several high-profile celebrities as a secure investment platform
— due to financial mismanagement and the misappropriation of
customer funds.3 The implications of celebrity
endorsements are especially significant given the emergence of
young investors who increasingly turn to social media to discover
and validate investment opportunities.4

The Statement prompts consideration of the current state of
celebrity-endorsed crypto asset regulation and how it might change
given the shift in the SEC's regulatory priorities, as well
as the broader impact of this shift on the Canadian regulatory
environment.

The SEC has historically taken a decisive stance on the
application of anti-touting laws (which make it unlawful to promote
a security for compensation without fully disclosing the receipt
and amount of such compensation) with respect to celebrity-endorsed
crypto assets. In 2017, following a surge of celebrities promoting
investments in initial coin offerings (ICOs), 
the SEC issued a statement urging caution around
celebrity-backed ICOs, warning that such offerings could involve
the issuance or distribution of securities which require compliance
with federal laws. It reaffirmed the requirement for persons making
endorsements of investments in ICOs to disclose compensation
received for the endorsements. More particularly, Section 17(b) of
the US Securities Act5 makes it
unlawful for any person to “publish, give publicity to, or
circulate any […] communication which […] describes
such security for a consideration […] from an issuer,
underwriter, or dealer, without fully disclosing the receipt,
whether past or prospective, of such consideration and the amount
thereof.” By requiring such disclosure, Section 17(b) aims to
safeguard the public from marketing or promotional activities
(including social media posts) that claim to offer impartial
opinions but are actually influenced by payments.

Similarly, social media marketing of financial services caught
the eye of the US Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).
In September 2021, FINRA launched a targeted examination seeking to
examine how firms found, contracted, and compensated social media
influencers to promote their products and services (e.g., referral
programs).6 In November 2022, FINRA also launched a
targeted exam to review the practices of firms actively
communicating with retail customers concerning crypto
assets.7 In its update on the 2022 Sweep, FINRA
noted having identified potential substantive violations of FINRA
Rule 2210 in approximately 70 percent of the over 500
crypto-asset-related retail communication
reviewed.8 Namely, FINRA observed false claims
about the nature of crypto assets, misleading comparisons and
explanations, omissions of key details, and misrepresentations
about legal protections and coverage. However, given the current US
administration's evolving policy on crypto asset regulation,
it is unclear whether FINRA will continue to maintain the same
level of scrutiny on social media marketing of financial
services.

In Canada, the laws surrounding anti-touting are not as robust
as in the US given the lack of a statutory equivalent to Section
17(b) above. Nonetheless, concerns regarding social media promotion
have been on the Canadian Securities Administrators' (CSA)
radar. In November 2018, the CSA released 
Staff Notice 51-356 – Problematic promotional
activities by issuers, which served to caution issuers
against engaging in promotional activities that could artificially
inflate an issuer's share price and trading volume, or
otherwise mislead investors. Such promotional activities, according
to the CSA, include compensating third parties who utilize social
media to promote issuers without disclosing their agency,
compensation, and/or financial interest. In September 2021, the CSA
and the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) jointly
issued 
Staff Notice 21-330 – Guidance for Crypto-Trading
Platforms – Requirements relating to Advertising, Marketing
and Social Media Use (SN 21-330), which addressed
deceptive advertising practices by crypto asset trading platforms
(CTPs) and third parties acting on their behalf. SN 21-330
expressed concern with CTPs' use of marketing tactics like
contests, promotions, and time-limited offers to prompt quick
trading, which could lead investors to take on excessive risks.

The Ontario Securities Commission has also taken steps to
address third-party marketing partnerships through 
Staff Notice 33-755 – Summary Report for Dealers,
Advisors and Investment Fund Managers (SN 33-755),
where it noted the requirement for issuers to establish measures to
monitor and oversee their arrangements with marketing partners
(i.e., corporations or individual bloggers/influencers with an
established online audience or following) and to verify that
statements made about the firm's products and services are
fair, substantiated, and not misleading. In particular, SN 33-755
noted that registered firms should provide sufficient disclosure to
make clients aware of the arrangement between the firm and the
marketing partner and any associated conflicts of interest,
including compensation paid to the marketing partner.

The British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC) has also been
active in regulating promotional activities lacking appropriate
disclosure. In May 2021, the regulator published the 
proposed British Columbia Instrument 51-519 (the Proposed
Instrument), which would mandate that TSX Venture issuers who
retain or compensate individuals for promotional activities must
issue and file a news release that includes details, such as the
contact information of the engaged party, the platforms on which
the promotional activities will occur, and the compensation to be
provided for these activities. Although the Proposed Instrument is
not yet in effect, the BCSC has actively addressed undisclosed
online paid promotional activities by relying on existing
provisions of the Securities Act (British
Columbia), specifically Section 52(2) which provides as
follows:9

52(2) A person engaged in investor
relations activities, and an issuer or security holder on whose
behalf investor relations activities are undertaken, must ensure
that every record disseminated, as part of the investor relations
activities, by the person engaged in those activities clearly and
conspicuously discloses that the record is issued by or on behalf
of the issuer or security holder.

For example, in January 2023, the BCSC found in Re
Stock Social Inc.,10that investor relations records
must “clearly and conspicuously” disclose if they are
disseminated by or on behalf of an issuer or security holder under
Section 52(2). The panel noted that the obligation applies to
promotional and marketing materials, including social media posts
by influencers and is binding on issuers and those disseminating
the promotional advertisements in British Columbia. In April 2024,
the BCSC released 
BC Notice 51-703, wherein it reiterated the key points from the
decision in Re Stock Social Inc.

Celebrity and influencer involvement in ICOs and retail
investments has evolved beyond merely receiving undisclosed
payments for promotions. Given their ability to leverage their
influence on social media platforms, celebrities and influencers
are well-equipped to engage in market manipulation by artificially
inflating or deflating asset prices, which would be considered
non-compliant with Section 10(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 193411 and Rule
10b-512  thereunder. These provisions prohibit any
individual from directly or indirectly employing any means to
defraud, making false statements, omitting pertinent information,
or otherwise engaging in business practices that would deceive
another party during securities transactions.

While the current presidential administration has shifted
priorities away from the enforcement-focused approach of the
previous administration, the SEC had relied on these rules in
enforcement actions involving market manipulation and insider
trading. For instance, 
the SEC charged Ishan Wahi, his brother, and a close
friend with insider trading in crypto assets, violating
Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. Wahi, a manager at Coinbase Global,
Inc., was reportedly part of a “tight circle” that was
entrusted with knowledge of which crypto asset securities would be
listed on Coinbase's exchange, as well as the anticipated
timing of such listings. A token being listed on an exchange or
marketplace can have a material effect on its
price.13 The SEC accused Wahi, his brother, and his
friend of trading ahead of announcements. The brothers settled the
insider trading charges by agreeing to permanent injunctions
against violating securities laws, paying disgorgement of
ill-gotten gains, and serving prison time.14

In Canada, anti-market manipulation and anti-fraud provisions
are found in National Instrument 23-101 and provincial securities
laws. For example, Section 126.1 of the Securities
Act (Ontario) provides that it is prohibited to engage,
or attempt to engage, in any conduct related to securities or
derivatives that creates a misleading appearance of trading
activity or an artificial price, or that perpetrates
fraud.15 Section 126.2 also provides that making
materially misleading or untrue statements that could significantly
affect the market price or value of a security or derivative is
prohibited.16 Insider trading is addressed
separately; in Ontario, prohibitions are contained in the Section
76(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), which
provides that no person or company in a special relationship with
an issuer can trade securities of the issuer or disclose material
facts or changes about the issuer that have not been generally
disclosed.17

Although these provisions apply to social media influencers
engaged in market manipulation and insider trading schemes,
Canadian provincial regulators have yet to pursue cases analogous
to those handled by the SEC. Nonetheless, the CSA has recently
commented on the existing framework surrounding market manipulation
and insider trading in the context of evolving technologies,
indicating a readiness to address similar issues involving crypto
assets.18

The SEC's Statement has introduced ambiguity into the
regulatory landscape surrounding celebrity-endorsed crypto assets,
particularly meme coins. As outlined above, regulatory actions in
this area have historically relied on securities-related
legislation. However, the SEC's clarification that meme coins
generally do not constitute securities under federal law challenges
this approach. This raises broader questions about how authorities
might regulate the influence of celebrities in the crypto asset
space beyond meme coin ventures, especially as their endorsements
continue to significantly impact investor behaviour.

In Canada, the classification of meme coins as securities
remains unresolved, and there is a limited track record of
regulatory action concerning celebrity-endorsed crypto asset
ventures. While Canadian regulators are increasingly vigilant about
the potential risks posed by undisclosed promotional activities,
particularly in the realm of social media and digital marketing,
the SEC's stance adds further uncertainty to the approach
that Canadian regulators might adopt in this realm.

As bitcoin (BTC) and ether's (ETH) recovery rally gathered momentum Tuesday, the perpetual futures market saw an even more pronounced increase in open interest, pointing to growing investor confidence as the Trump administration dialed back on its trade-tariff, anti-Fed rhetoric.

BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, rose 6.79% nearly topping $94,000 for the first time since March, CoinDesk data show. That's the most significant single-day percentage gain since April 9. The Ethereum blockchain's ether token  jumped 11% to $1,1175, it's best performance since April 2.

The rally came as U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent discussed de-escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions, followed by President Donald Trump saying tariffs on Chinese goods will drop substantially from the present 245%. Trump further said he does not intend to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

The price surge was characterized by traders deploying money for perpetual futures trading on major offshore exchanges as evidenced by bigger increases in open interest at Binance, Bybit, OKX and Deribit and leading on-chain perpetual-focused decentralized exchange Hyperliquid.

The cumulative notional open interest, or the dollar value of the number of active bets in BTC perpetual futures, rose by 10% to $17.83 billion, according to data source Velo. That's the biggest single-day increase since March 2, when Trump mentioned XRP, ADA and SOL as potential candidates for a strategic digital assets reserve that would hold bitcoin and ether as the core. The administration later said it would keep bitcoin seized in enforcement actions as a reserve.

""Bitcoin's Open Interest surged faster than its Price, with most positions originating from Binance,"" Joao Wedson, CEO of Alphractal Research, said on X. ""The issue is that a large portion consists of Longs, so increased volatility is expected in the coming hours."" 

The price surge was likely aided by short squeeze, or unwinding of short perpetual futures bets. Funding rates were negative roughly 24 hours ago, implying a bias for shorts. 

Ether's notional open interest jumped nearly 16% to $6.60 billion, the largest single-day increase since Nov. 27.

An increase in open interest alongside a price rise is said to confirm the bullish momentum. In other words, BTC and ETH could continue to rise.

The bias for bullish long positions is also evident from the moderately positive annualized perpetual funding rates, ranging between annualized 5% to 10% for BTC and ETH.

Funding rates, charged every eight hours, are payments exchanged between traders holding long and short positions in perpetual futures. They are designed to ensure the contract price stays close to the underlying asset's spot price.

A positive funding rate implies that traders are more inclined and willing to pay fees to hold long positions. As such, it's considered a sign of bullish sentiment. However, excessively high funding rates can indicate overcrowding or bullish speculative fervor, but that's not the case right now.

In a rare legal defeat for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency has formally dropped its fraud case against Richard Schueler, better known as Richard Heart, founder of the crypto projects HEX, PulseChain, and PulseX.

On April 21, the SEC informed the Eastern District Court of New York it would not amend its complaint, effectively bringing the case to a close.

“That brings the case to an end with a complete victory for Mr. Heart,” said David Kirk, partner at Kirk & Ingram LLP, who represented the HEX founder in an email to CoinDesk. “To my knowledge, this is the only SEC enforcement action against a participant in the cryptocurrency industry that was dismissed in its entirety by a federal judge.”

The court had previously dismissed the SEC's initial complaint in February, citing a lack of jurisdiction.

Judge Carol Bagley Amon noted that Heart's activities were not clearly targeted at U.S. investors, CoinDesk previously reported, undermining the SEC's case.

""This is a victory for open-source software, cryptocurrency, and free speech. The SEC actually sued software code itself in this case, claiming it could be an alter ego of a person,"" Heart posted on X. ""This would have set a terrible precedent and caused perhaps multiple billions of dollars of damage to the vital open source and free software industry that powers most of the Internet and your speech on it.""

Though the regulator was granted an opportunity to amend the complaint, it declined to do so by the extended April 21 deadline.

The SEC had originally filed suit in July 2023, accusing Heart of raising over $1 billion through unregistered securities offerings.

Bitcoin (BTC) miner Riot Platforms (RIOT) has struck a $100 million credit agreement with Coinbase's credit arm, using bitcoin as collateral to secure short-term funding for its ongoing expansion.

The publicly traded mining firm said in a press release it would draw on the facility over the next two months. The deal offers Riot, which currently holds 19,223 BTC worth over $1.8 billion, a line of credit that avoids issuing new shares.

“This credit facility is a key part of our efforts to diversify sources of financing to support our operations and strategic growth initiatives, with a view towards long-term stockholder value creation,” said CEO Jason Les in a statement.

The loan, issued by Coinbase Credit, comes with a variable interest rate: borrowers will pay at least 7.75% annually, calculated as the greater of 3.25% or the federal funds rate upper bound, plus 4.5%. The loan term is 364 days, though Riot may seek a one-year extension if Coinbase agrees to it.

The credit facility is secured by a portion of Riot's total bitcoin reserves. The firm said it will use the funds “to pursue key strategic initiatives and for general corporate purposes.”

Coinbase has been making other similar deals. Just last week, healthcare technology firm Semler Scientific (SMLR) announced it reached an agreement with Coinbase to borrow cash via a loan secured by its bitcoin holdings.

Hut 8 (HUT), another bitcoin miner, has also leveraged a bitcoin-backed credit facility with Coinbase in the past.

Brandon Lutnick, son of U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and chair of Cantor Fitzgerald, is launching a listed bitcoin (BTC) investment vehicle backed by SoftBank, Tether and Bitfinex and headed by co-founder Jack Mallers, the CEO of bitcoin-focused payments app Strike.

The company, to be called Twenty One Capital after merging with Cantor Equity Partners, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), will be majority owned by Tether, issuer of the largest stablecoin, and cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, the companies said in a statement. SoftBank, an investment-holding company, will own a ""significant minority"" stake.

Tether and Bitfinex are contributing $1.5 billion and $600 million, respectively, while SoftBank is adding $900 million, the FT reported earlier. The venture plans to raise another $550 million through bonds and private equity to purchase more BTC. Twenty One plans to have more than 42,000 BTC at launch, giving it the third-largest bitcoin treasury. Strategy (MSTR) has 538,200 and MARA Holdings (MARA) 47,531.

The deal mirrors Strategy's bitcoin proxy model and would convert the BTC into equity at a valuation near $85,000 per coin, according to the release. It was announced amid renewed crypto optimism under the Trump administration, with bitcoin hovering near $93,000 and regulatory tailwinds shifting.

The company will measure its performance in BTC. Twenty One Capital is set to bring in two new metrics: Bitcoin Per Share (BPS), a measure of how much BTC each share represents, and Bitcoin Return Rate (BRR), which tracks BPS growth.

“We're not here to beat the market, we're here to build a new one,"" Mallers said in the statement. ""A public stock, built by Bitcoiners, for Bitcoiners.”

Cantor Fitzgerald is one of Tether's custodians, holding the majority of its U.S. Treasuries.

Shares of Cantor Equity Partners are set to keep trading on Nasdaq under the CEP ticker until the transaction is finalized. Once the deal closes, Twenty One intends to trade under the ticker “XXI” on the exchange.

UPDATE (April 23, 15:30 UTC): Adds Mallers as CEO in headine, first paragraph, details from official release.

 Despite spot Bitcoin ETFs recording over $900 million in inflows on April 22, one analyst warns Bitcoiners to stay cautious amid the ongoing rally. 

Bitcoin's 12% rally over the week and a surge in related exchange-traded fund inflows have analysts thinking it could soon reach $100,000, but one crypto analyst has said to temper hopes as a key indicator is still giving mixed signals.

“Given that our stablecoin minting indicator has yet to return to high-activity levels, we remain cautious about the sustainability of the current Bitcoin rally,” 10x Research head of research Markus Thielen said in an April 23 markets report.

Thielen explained that a measured move from the falling wedge pattern, which traders perceive as a potential bullish reversal signal, shows that Bitcoin (BTC) may reclaim $99,000.

He added, however, that “the absence of strong stablecoin inflows raises questions about follow-through.”

Bitcoin was trading at $93,133 at the time of writing, up 11.42% over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap. 

Thielen told Cointelegraph that stablecoin inflows “tend to correlate strongly with stickier money, while an increase in futures leverage could simply mean that fast traders are taking advantage of a quick move higher.” 

It comes as spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US posted inflows of $912.7 million on April 22, the highest level since Jan. 17, according to Farside data.

Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph that the inflows suggest “this is a true, demand-led rally. Not just a hot flash of excited futures traders moving price.”

Thielen said if uncertainty continues to decline, “a further acceleration could provide the liquidity needed to support a more sustained rally.”

The crypto market has experienced volatility and broader financial markets since US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs in early February. 

However, Trump's recent comments have traders speculating that he's softening his stance on the trade war, with some seeing this as bullish for markets.

Thielen said the $95,000 price level is a key resistance level for Bitcoin and a “potential trigger point for short-stop liquidations.”

He said it could push Bitcoin's price higher if market strength continues.

 Crypto drainers have evolved into an accessible, professionalized software-as-a-service industry, enabling low-skill actors to steal cryptocurrency. 

Crypto drainers, malware designed to steal cryptocurrency, have become easier to access as the ecosystem evolves into a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model.

In an April 22 report, crypto forensics and compliance firm AMLBot revealed that many drainer operations have transitioned to a SaaS model known as drainer-as-a-service (DaaS). The report revealed that malware spreaders can rent a drainer for as little as 100 to 300 USDt (USDT).

AMLBot CEO Slava Demchuk told Cointelegraph that “previously, entering the world of cryptocurrency scams required a fair amount of technical knowledge.” That is no longer the case. Under the DaaS model, “getting started isn't significantly more difficult than with other types of cybercrime.”

Demchuk explained that would-be drainer users join online communities to learn from experienced scammers who provide guides and tutorials. This is how many criminals involved with traditional phishing campaigns transition to the crypto drainer space.

Groups offering crypto drainers as a service are increasingly bold and some are evolving almost like traditional business models, Demchuk said, adding:

When asked how a criminal operation can send representatives to information technology industry events without repercussions, such as arrests, he pointed to Russian cybercrime enforcement as the reason. “This can all be done in jurisdictions like Russia, where hacking is now essentially legalized if you're not operating across the post-Soviet space,” he said.

The practice has been an open secret in the cybersecurity industry for many years. Cybersecurity news publication KrebsOnSecurity reported in 2021 that “virtually all ransomware strains” deactivate without causing harm if they detect Russian virtual keyboards installed.

Similarly, the information stealer Typhon Reborn v2 checks the user's IP geolocation against a list of post-Soviet countries. According to networking firm Cisco, if it determines that it is located in one of those countries, it deactivates. The reason is simple: Russian authorities have shown that they will act if local hackers hit citizens of the post-Soviet bloc.

Demchuk further explained that DaaS organizations usually find their clientele within existing phishing communities. This includes gray and black hat forums on both clearnet (regular internet) and darknet (deep web), as well as Telegram groups and channels and gray market platforms.

In 2024, Scam Sniffer reported that drainers were responsible for about $494 million in losses, a 67% increase over the previous year, despite a 3.7% increase in the number of victims. Drainers are on the increase, with cybersecurity giant Kaspersky reporting that the number of online resources dedicated to them on darknet forums rose from 55 in 2022 to 129 in 2024.

Developers are often recruited through normal job adverts. AMLBot's open-source intelligence investigator, who prefers to remain anonymous for safety reasons, told Cointelegraph that while researching drainers, his team “did come across several job postings specifically targeting developers to build drainers for Web3 ecosystems.”

He provided one job advert that described the required features of a script that would empty Hedera (HBAR) wallets. Once again, the offer was mainly targeted at Russian speakers:

The investigator further added that ads like this appear in Telegram chats for smart-contract developers. Those chats are not private or restricted, but they are small, with usually 100 to 200 members.

Administrators quickly deleted the announcement provided as an example. Still, “as is often the case, those who needed to see it had already taken note and responded.”

Traditionally, this kind of business was conducted on specialized clearnet forums and deep web forums accessible through the Tor network. Still, the investigator said that much of the content moved to Telegram thanks to its policy against sharing data with authorities. This changed following the arrest of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov:

Still, this is a concern to cybercriminals that may no longer be relevant. Earlier this week, Durov expressed misgivings over a growing threat to private messaging in France and other European Union countries, warning that Telegram would rather exit certain markets than implement encryption backdoors that undermine user privacy.

 Bitcoin ETFs recorded their highest inflows in over three months as investors regained confidence. 

Investments in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) rebounded to levels last seen in January, signaling a recovery in investor sentiment from concerns about global trade tariff escalations.

US spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs had over $912 million worth of cumulative net inflows on April 22, marking their highest daily investment in more than three months since Jan. 21, Farside Investors data shows.

“Bitcoin ETPs just saw the largest daily inflows since 21st January in a dramatic improvement in sentiment,” according to James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.

Related: Bitcoin still on track for $1.8M in 2035, says analyst

Investor sentiment appeared to improve after US President Donald Trump said that import tariffs on Chinese goods will “come down substantially,” adopting a softer tone in negotiations.

The de-escalation and growing ETF inflows pushed Bitcoin price above $93,000 for the first time in seven weeks, Cointelegraph reported on April 23.

The growing institutional investment and presence of ETFs may also accelerate the historic four-year cycle and bolster BTC to new highs before the end of 2025, analysts told Cointelegraph.

The US dollar's weakness may contribute to the growing investor demand for Bitcoin. 

The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the strength of the greenback against a basket of leading fiat currencies, has declined 9% since the beginning of 2025, touching a three-year low of 98.8 last seen in April 2022, TradingView data shows.

“Macro factors like a weakening dollar and rising gold correlation” may reinforce Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against economic volatility, Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, told Cointelegraph.

Crypto and traditional stock markets are “walking a tightrope between political drama and economic reality,” with Bitcoin staging a significant rebound thanks to “strong ETF inflows, institutional acquisitions, and a weakening US dollar,” according to Nexo dispatch analyst Iliya Kalchev:

“The conversation has clearly shifted. Bitcoin is no longer trading in the shadows of tech — it's becoming a lens through which macro uncertainty is priced,” he added.

Nansen CEO Alex Svanevik also praised Bitcoin's resilience, noting that the maturing asset has become “less Nasdaq — more gold” in the past two weeks, increasingly acting as a safe haven asset against economic turmoil, though concerns over economic recession may limit its price trajectory.

On April 21, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicted that this might be the “last chance” to buy Bitcoin below $100,000, as the incoming US Treasury buybacks may signal the next significant catalyst for Bitcoin price.

 Michael Saylor and Blue Macellari praised new SEC Chair Paul Atkins, calling him positive for Bitcoin and crypto policy. 

Michael Saylor, the CEO of top corporate Bitcoin holder Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), expressed support for newly appointed US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins.

In an April 23 X post, Saylor wrote that “SEC Chairman Paul Atkins will be good for Bitcoin.” The statement follows Atkins' swearing-in as the 34th chairman of the SEC on April 21.

Blue Macellari, the head of digital assets at investment firm T. Rowe Price, also commented positively on Atkins' swearing in during a recent Bloomberg interview. She seemed hopeful and recognized a change in how the SEC has acted under the new administration, particularly with crypto-related information, including “close to six or seven roundtables” with industry professionals. She said:

Vincent Liu , chief investment officer at crypto investment firm Kronos Research, told Cointelegraph that “under Chair Atkins, finalizing custody rules for digital assets is expected to provide the investor protections that institutions demand.” Other issues expected to be resolved are clarification on whether some digital assets are securities or commodities:

Accolades from representatives of the crypto industry readily followed Atkins' appointment by US President Trump in late 2024. Bitwise Asset Management general counsel Katherine Dowling said at the time that he is a “great choice,” and Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that he “will bring common sense back to the agency.”

Not everyone was happy with the choice. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said during Atkins's nomination hearing that he had had “staggeringly bad judgment” in his role as a SEC commissioner leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. Atkins served at the agency from 2002 to 2008.

She also raised an issue with his consulting firm, Patomak Global Partners, which had advised the crypto exchange FTX before its 2022 collapse. Warren said:

Liu said that “to maintain public trust and avoid even the perception of regulatory conflict of interest, it's essential to implement clear guardrails.” Such a guardrail would include mandatory disclosures of prior industry ties, ethics oversight, and transparent public comment periods for all crypto rules.

Warren also sent a letter to Atkins in late March, stating that he should expect questions about his potential role at the agency due to his ties to the crypto industry through Patomak. Before being appointed, Atkins revealed a personal and family financial portfolio worth more than $327 million, according to a public ethics filing released ahead of his Senate confirmation hearing. 

Similarly, Trump's artificial intelligence and crypto czar, David Sacks, filed a notice in early March suggesting that his venture capital firm sold more than $200 million in crypto and related stocks ahead of assuming his role.

Here's how scientists unlocked new hidden secrets of the iconic monument.

Stonehenge offers mysteries aplenty. Just when we think we've solved one, we have to re-solve questions we thought were already answered. Such is the case with the origin story of the Altar Stone—one of the roughly 80-plus stones still on site in southern England. 

The stones of Stonehenge feature a variety of compositions and originate from a number of potential source locations. Scholars previously believed that they knew most of what there was to be known about the Altar Stone—the largest of the non-sarsen stones on site, which is now partially buried beneath two fallen stones. But researchers led by a team from Curtin University may have just upended that history, writing that a stone long believed to originate from Wales actually hails from Scotland. 

By studying the age and chemistry of mineral grains within fragments of the six-ton Alter Stone—a thick sandstone block measuring 16 feet by 3 feet in the center of the iconic Wiltshire circle—the team crafted a chemical fingerprint of the stone. That chemical composition matched that of rocks from northeast Scotland, and clearly differentiated it from Welsh bedrock. 

“Our analysis found specific mineral grains in the Altar Stone are mostly between 1,000 to 2,000 million years old, while other minerals are around 450 million years old,” Anthony Clarke, lead author and Ph.D. student from the Timescales of Mineral Systems Group at Curtin's School of Earth and Planetary Sciences, said in a statement. “This provides a distinct chemical fingerprint suggesting the stone came from rocks in the Orcadian Basin, Scotland, at least 750 kilometers [466 miles] away from Stonehenge.” 

According to English Heritage, the Altar Stone is a large slab of greenish Old Red Sandstone. Recent geological research had pinpointed the source of the stone to the Brecon Beacons area of southeast Wales. But the new study, which was published today in the journal Nature, discounts that reigning theory. 

Richard Bevins, study co-author and professor at Aberystwyth University, said in a statement that with the chemical fingerprint tracing the iconic rock to Scotland, the hunt for its exact point of origin starts now. 

Clarke said that the Scottish origins of the stone raise fascinating question regarding how such a massive stone was transported so far during the Neolithic era of roughly 2,600 BC. It must have required, the authors claim, an unexpectedly advanced transport method and complex societal organization.

“Our discovery of the Altar Stone's origins highlights a significant level of societal coordination during the Neolithic period and helps paint a fascinating picture of prehistoric Britain,” Chris Kirkland, study co-author and Curtin professor, said in a statement. “Transporting such massive cargo overland from Scotland to southern England would have been extremely challenging, indicating a likely marine shipping route along the coast of Britain. This implies long-distance trade networks and a higher level of societal organization than is widely understood to have existed during the Neolithic period in Britain.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Scientists Discovered a New Color. It's Been Right in Front of Us All Along.","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a64542602/olo-color-oz/","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Described as a kind of blue-green, the new color—named “olo”—can only be seen using lasers to manipulate certain photoreceptors.

The human eye is a wonder of evolution, and is our primary window into understanding the known universe that surrounds us. But even despite the hundreds of millions of years that fashioned our irises, formed our retinas, and molded our light-sensitive photoreceptors, our eyes can only see a fraction of the electromagnetic wonders that criss-cross the cosmos. 

And even in this small visible sliver of the electromagnetic pie, some colors remain hidden from our view—until now. In a new paper published in the journal Science Advances, scientists from the University of California Berkeley and the University of Washington describe how they managed to only stimulate the cones in our eyes responsible for interpreting medium wavelength light using laser light. The result was a never-before-seen color.

“The ultimate goal is to provide programmable control over every photoreceptor [light-sensing cell] in the retina,” Fong told Live Science. “Although this has not been achieved to that level, the method we present in the current study demonstrates that a lot of the key principles are possible in practice.”

First, a brief refresher on some elementary biology. The human eye senses light and color thanks to the millions of rods and cones located in the retina. While rods handle low-light conditions and enable dark vision, cones are responsible for bright light and color, and typically come in three flavors: long (L), medium (M), and short-wavelength (S) cones. When mapped to the wavelengths in the visible spectrum, this roughly amounts to L cones interpreting the color red, S cones glimpsing blue, and M cones falling in the middle near an approximation of the color green. (Some people, known as tetrachromats, actually have a fourth rod that sensitive to orange, but that's a story for another time).

Because M cones sit in the middle of the visible spectrum, they mostly overlap with L and S cones, meaning there's no natural light that stimulates M cones exclusively. So, researchers developed a tool—nicknamed Oz for Frank L. Baum's The Wizard of Oz—that mapped a person's retina, isolated the M cones, and then used a laser to specifically stimulate only those middle-of-the-road cones. The result, according to the researchers, was a color that was a type of blue-green no human had ever seen. The team nicknamed the color “olo,” which is a reference to a 3D map of color coded in binary 0,1,0 with “1” indicating the full stimulation of the M cone. 

“Attempting to activate M cones exclusively is shown to elicit a color beyond the natural human gamut, formally measured with color matching by human subjects,” the authors write in the paper. “They describe the color as blue-green of unprecedented saturation.”

Although some scientists remain unconvinced that “olo” is indeed a new color—one vision scientist told The Guardian that the work has “limited value”—Fong and his team hope that further exploration of the retina using Oz could help treat color blindness and other retinal diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa. The tool could also be used to simulate what it would be like to be one of those genetically mutated women (it's mostly women) that have four distinct cones and can see millions more colors than the average human. 

For as much as we think we know when it comes to color, evidently there's more than meets the eye.

This newly published study is the first to show that cold memories form in the brain -- and map out how they subsequently drive thermoregulation.

The discovery may have important applications in therapies designed to treat a range of disorders -- from obesity to cancer -- in which thermoregulation and metabolism (or a lack of control in this area) plays a role, as well as opening the door to more fundamental research, which could help us better understand how memories impact our behaviour and emotions.

In 1897, the physiologist Ivan Pavlov first described classical conditioning, where animals and humans form associations between different aspects of the environment. He showed that dogs could be trained to salivate in hopeful anticipation of food, when an associated bell was rung. Classical or Pavlovian conditioning has since become a core staple of neuroscience and psychology.

Long-term memories are stored in the brain as ensembles of inter-connected cells, termed engrams. Increasingly, modern neuroscience is beginning to identify engrams that encode for bodily representations, such as experiences of infection; inflammation; food consumption; and pain.

The researchers behind this work hypothesised that the brain may form engrams for temperature representations, and that these would serve to help an organism survive in changing temperatures. But to identity these engrams they first had to test whether cold memories could form in the first place.

While memories are generally measured as changes in animal behaviour, the Ryan Lab collaborated with Prof. Lydia Lynch (then at Trinity College Dublin, now at Princeton University). They focused on metabolism as a first-order readout of cold experience, because mammals are known to increase their metabolism to create heat in the body when the environment is cold, via a process of adaptive thermogenesis.

Lead author of the article published today in the journal, Nature,, Dr Andrea Muñoz Zamora, successfully trained mice to associate a cold experience of 4oC with novel visual cues that were only present in designated cold contexts. After a few days, mice were presented with the visual cues in the same context, but at room temperature. Crucially, the team discovered that the animals would upregulate their metabolism to induce predictive thermogenesis when they were ""expecting"" the environment to be cold.

Having established that mice could form memories of cold experiences, the team then delved into how this was happening in the brain. Using activity-dependent gene labelling, the scientists were able to genetically hitchhike onto the engram cells coding for the cold memory in a brain region known as the hippocampus. Remarkably, when these cold engram cells were artificially stimulated (using a technique called optogenetics), the mice increased their metabolism in order to generate heat. And in a converse experiment, to double-check the central finding, when cold engram cells were inhibited the mice were unable to express cold memories in response to the conditioned visual cues.

Dr Muñoz Zamora, said: ""We discovered that when mice are exposed to a cold temperature they form memories that allow them to up-regulate their body's metabolism when they anticipate cold experiences in the future.""

Prof. Lynch added: ""A large part of this learned control of body temperature seems to be due to increased activity of brown adipose tissue -- or brown fat -- which can be controlled by innervations originating in the brain. Our brain must learn from the bodily experiences of cold, but then feeds back to control how our fat cells respond to cold.""

Dr Aaron Douglas, who was joint lead author on the study, said: ""Numerous clinical disorders, ranging from obesity to forms of cancer, may be treated by manipulating thermoregulation through brown adipose tissue. In the future, it will be important to test whether the manipulation of cold memories in humans could provide novel avenues for altering metabolism for therapeutic purposes.""

This research opens many new doors for further discovery research, as well as the development of treatments. Understanding how representations of cold experiences affect broader brain functions such as emotion, decision-making, and social behaviour will provide insights into the embodied nature of the mind, for example.

""The sophisticated aspects of our minds evolved from more basic, visceral, bodily representations,"" said Prof. Ryan. ""Understanding how these components of our brain affect our behaviour in general is crucial to understanding our emotions and our use of memory.""

""This integrative piece of work offers a quintessential example of inter-disciplinary science. Neuroscience requires collaboration and it was the synergy with Prof. Lynch that allowed the unusual combination of memory engram work with metabolism research.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","The most effective prevention method for complications post lung transplant","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/04/250422155820.htm","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 00:15:20 GMT","

When receiving a lung transplant, one of the most important complications to look out for is chronic lung allograft dysfunction, known as CLAD.

Preventing this complication for those who receive a lung transplant is of the highest priority, as there are no universally effective treatments for CLAD once it is established.

The most common of the immunosuppressing medications given to lung transplant recipients are calcineurin inhibitors.

Only two calcineurin inhibitors exist, cyclosporine and tacrolimus, and the available formulations are once-daily slow-release tacrolimus, twice-daily immediate-release tacrolimus and twice-daily cyclosporine.

While the medications have the same end goal, preventing rejection, whether they are equally effective is unknown.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction is a label for a wide range of clinical manifestations that all lead to the transplanted lung losing its normal function.

There can be some variation in how CLAD presents, as some patients have an obstructive ventilatory defect, some have a restrictive defect, and some have a mix of the two.

Regardless of the type, however, once chronic lung allograft dysfunction develops, lung function does not improve.

In the absence of effective treatments, strategies to prevent CLAD are crucial.

Using the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Thoracic Organ Transplant Registry data, a research team led by Michael Combs, M.D., M.S., an assistant professor of pulmonary diseases and internal medicine at Michigan Medicine, conducted the first study to show a survival benefit between using the treatments tacrolimus versus cyclosporine after lung transplantation.

Out of the 22,222 individuals with data for chronic lung allograft dysfunction treatment, 88.6% received tacrolimus immediate release.

The participants taking immediate release tacrolimus had a much lower rate of experiencing chronic lung allograft dysfunction than their counterparts that took twice-daily cyclosporine.

Combs wanted to highlight the positive finding for the twice-daily immediate release tacrolimus in this study.

""The Scan-CLAD study published earlier in the year found that tacrolimus once-daily extended-release had the best outcomes with regards to preventing the development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction, but the vast-majority of patients in actual practice are on twice-daily tacrolimus,"" said Combs.

""This present study should reassure transplant patients and providers twice-daily tacrolimus -- and not only once-daily tacrolimus -- is the superior treatment to cyclosporine.""

""Importantly,"" Combs added, ""in our study we found that twice-daily tacrolimus not only resulted in lower rates of CLAD relative to cyclosporine, but it was also associated with improved overall survival after lung transplantation. This is an important, patient-centered finding which has not been previously demonstrated.""

""Given the theoretical benefits of once-daily medication regiments, future research will need to investigate if either tacrolimus XR and tacrolimus IR are superior to each other. However, until then, we can rest assured knowing that tacrolimus -- regardless of its formulation -- is the best option for our lung transplant patients,"" he stated.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New species of electricity-conducting organism, name it after Tribe","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/04/250422155932.htm","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 01:13:42 GMT","

Scientists have identified a novel species of bacteria that acts as electrical wiring, potentially ushering in a new era of bioelectronic devices for use in medicine, industry, food safety, and environmental monitoring and cleanup.

The researchers who discovered the new cable bacteria species in a mud flat at the Oregon coast named it Ca. Electrothrix yaqonensis in honor of the Native Americans of the region where the species was found.

Findings were published today in Applied and Environmental Microbiology.

Cheng Li, a postdoctoral researcher at Oregon State University at the time of the research, and Clare Reimers, distinguished professor emerita in the OSU College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences, identified the new species in intertidal sediment samples from the Yaquina Bay estuary.

Cable bacteria consist of rod-shaped cells attached end to end with a shared outer membrane, forming filaments that can reach several centimeters in length. Their electrical conductivity, unusual among bacteria, is an adaptation that optimizes their metabolic processes in the sediment environments in which they live.

The new species features metabolic pathways and genes that are a mix of the Ca. Electrothrix genus and the other known cable bacteria genus, Ca. Electronema.

""This new species seems to be a bridge, an early branch within the Ca. Electrothrix clade, which suggests it could provide new insights into how these bacteria evolved and how they might function in different environments,"" said Li, who in June will return to Oregon State as an assistant professor in the College of Agricultural Sciences following a stint on the faculty of James Madison University.

""It stands out from all other described cable bacteria species in terms of its metabolic potential, and it has distinctive structural features, including pronounced surface ridges, up to three times wider than those seen in other species, that house highly conductive fibers made of unique, nickel-based molecules.""

The fibers enable the bacteria to perform long-distance electron transport, connecting electron acceptors like oxygen or nitrate at the sediment surface with donors like sulfide in deeper sediment layers. The bacteria's ability to participate in reduction-oxidation reactions over significant distances gives it a key role in sediment geochemistry and nutrient cycling.

""These bacteria can transfer electrons to clean up pollutants, so they could be used to remove harmful substances from sediments,"" Li said. ""Also, their design of a highly conductive nickel protein can possibly inspire new bioelectronics.""

Cable bacteria can live under diverse climatic conditions and are found in various environments, including both freshwater and saltwater sediments.

Ca. Electrothrix yaqonensis draws its name from the Yaqona people, whose ancestral lands encompassed Yaquina Bay. Yaqona referred to the bay and river that made up much of their homeland, as well as to the people themselves.

Today, Yaqona descendants are part of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, with whom the researchers worked on coming up with a name for the new species.

""Naming an ecologically important bacterium after a Tribe recognizes its historical bond with the land and acknowledges its enduring contributions to ecological knowledge and sustainability,"" Li said.

Scientists from the University of Antwerp, Delft University of Technology and the University of Vienna also participated in the research, which was supported by the Office of Naval Research, Oregon Sea Grant, Research Foundation Flanders, the University of Antwerp, the EU Marie Sklodowska-Curie Cofund and the European Innovation Council.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Light fields with extraordinary structure: Plasmonic skyrmion bags","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/04/250422190639.htm","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 01:35:01 GMT","

A research group at the University of Stuttgart has manipulated light through its interaction with a metal surface so that it exhibits entirely new properties. The researchers have published their findings in Nature Physics.

""Our results add another chapter to the emerging field of skyrmion research,"" proclaims Prof. Harald Giessen, head of the Fourth Physics Institute at the University of Stuttgart, whose group achieved this breakthrough. The team demonstrated the existence of ""skyrmion bags"" of light on the surface of a metal layer.

A better understanding of physical phenomena

Skyrmions are a mathematical description of vortex-like structures that help researchers better understand fundamental physical relationships. In recent years, this theoretical concept has been confirmed experimentally across a wide range of areas, including magnetic solids and material surfaces. Giessen's group has now investigated whether light impinging on the structured surface of a thin gold layer can be made to behave like skyrmion bags that follow specific symmetries. These bags consist of skyrmions contained within a larger skyrmion. For their experiment, the researchers etched fine grooves in the shape of two twisted hexagons into the gold surface with each hexagon generating a skyrmion light field.

Targeted manipulation of light fields

""We then observed a superposition of two skyrmion light fields, from which the skyrmion bags formed,"" explains Julian Schwab, lead author of the publication and doctoral student in Giessen's research group. Even more strikingly, the researchers were able to vary the number of skyrmions gathered within the skyrmion bags by adjusting the degree to which the light fields were twisted relative to one another. In other words, the researchers can manipulate light fields in a targeted manner, thereby giving them shapes that usually do not occur. For the experimental verification, Giessen's team collaborated with a research group at the University of Duisburg-Essen, and for the theoretical description of the phenomenon, with a group at the Technion in Haifa.

Fundamental research with application potential

So far, this is still fundamental physics. However, these light-field skyrmions exhibit extraordinary properties, thereby sparking researchers' imagination in terms of potential technical applications. Whether the gold surface used by Giessen's team is suitable for this purpose remains to be seen. ""If someone finds a suitable material, our concept could be applied in microscopy,"" states Giessen. We could achieve resolutions with specialized microscopes that would otherwise be impossible because of the limits set by the wavelength of the light.

Metrics details

Neuroimmune interactions—signals transmitted between immune and brain cells—regulate many aspects of tissue physiology1, including responses to psychological stress2,3,4,5, which can predispose individuals to develop neuropsychiatric diseases6,7,8,9. Still, the interactions between haematopoietic and brain-resident cells that influence complex behaviours are poorly understood. Here, we use a combination of genomic and behavioural screens to show that astrocytes in the amygdala limit stress-induced fear behaviour through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Mechanistically, EGFR expression in amygdala astrocytes inhibits a stress-induced, pro-inflammatory signal-transduction cascade that facilitates neuron–glial crosstalk and stress-induced fear behaviour through the orphan nuclear receptor NR2F2 in amygdala neurons. In turn, decreased EGFR signalling and fear behaviour are associated with the recruitment of meningeal monocytes during chronic stress. This set of neuroimmune interactions is therapeutically targetable through the administration of psychedelic compounds, which reversed the accumulation of monocytes in the brain meninges along with fear behaviour. Together with validation in clinical samples, these data suggest that psychedelics can be used to target neuroimmune interactions relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders and potentially other inflammatory diseases.

Metrics details

Mendel1 studied in detail seven pairs of contrasting traits in pea (Pisum sativum), establishing the foundational principles of genetic inheritance. Here we investigate the genetic architecture that underlies these traits and uncover previously undescribed alleles for the four characterized Mendelian genes2,3,4,5,6,7, including a rare revertant of Mendel's white-flowered a allele. Primarily, we focus on the three remaining uncharacterized traits and find that (1) an approximately 100-kb genomic deletion upstream of the Chlorophyll synthase (ChlG) gene disrupts chlorophyll biosynthesis through the generation of intergenic transcriptional fusion products, conferring the yellow pod phenotype of gp mutants; (2) a MYB gene with an upstream Ogre element insertion and a CLE peptide-encoding gene with an in-frame premature stop codon explain the v and p alleles, which disrupt secondary cell wall thickening and lignification, resulting in the parchmentless, edible-pod phenotype; and (3) a 5-bp exonic deletion in a CIK-like co-receptor kinase gene, in combination with a genetic modifier locus, is associated with the fasciated stem (fa) phenotype. Furthermore, we characterize genes and alleles associated with diverse agronomic traits, such as axil ring anthocyanin pigmentation, seed size and the ‘semi-leafless' form. This study establishes a foundation for fundamental research, education in biology and genetics, and pea breeding practices.

Pea is an Old World crop that was first cultivated about 10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent8. About three quarters of the cultivated area is for dry seed, and the remaining quarter is for use as a vegetable, with a total export value of about US $3 billion in export value in 2022 (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/). Pea also has a minor use as a fodder crop and is often grown in home gardens. The nutritional and environmental advantages of this pulse crop, including the rising popularity of pea protein and its nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis, have been discussed elsewhere9,10.

Pea is predominantly inbreeding, with large flowers and many easily distinguishable characteristics, making it an ideal model for Mendel's studies of inheritance1,11. The seven variants that Mendel studied in detail were clearly distinguished in the seed catalogues of the time12, representing different agronomic forms, end uses or market types, as they still do today. Mendel's work on peas was described by Allan Franklin as “The best experiments ever done”13. In addition to its important historical contribution to the development of genetics, pea continues to serve as an excellent plant model system, with approximately 100 pea genes characterized at the molecular level14. However, much remains unknown about the molecular nature of the seven pairs of contrasting traits that Mendel studied, even though the genetic loci were named more than a century ago15. The four cloned genes R (seed shape), Le (plant height), I (seed colour) and A (flower colour) have been characterized for some time2,3,4,5,6,7,16, but the extent and distribution of their natural allelic variation remains poorly understood in a genomic context14,17,18. The gene identities of Mendel's three other traits, P and V (pod form), Gp (pod colour) and Fa (fasciation), are uncharacterized. Candidates for Gp and P have been proposed on the basis of specific genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and bi-parental mapping studies19,20,21; however, further work was needed to confirm or reject these proposals.

Here we present a sequence-based population genomic map and a trait-based phenotypic variation map, coupled with haplotype–phenotype association analyses across a wide range of traits in one of the world's major Pisum germplasm collections14. We focus on elucidating the gene identities and genomic context of alleles underlying Mendel's seven well-known traits. We further demonstrate how this approach can be expanded to uncover the molecular basis of a wide range of agronomic and horticultural characters with breeding potential.

It is widely accepted that Pisum has two wild species Pisum fulvum and Pisum elatius and two independently domesticated taxa Pisum abyssinicum and P. sativum (Supplementary Table 1). We selected a core diversity panel from the widely used John Innes Pisum Germplasm Collection14. This panel includes 500 accessions, selected using Corehunter 3 on the basis of prior genotyping data22,23. The selection was further supplemented with 130 lines previously chosen for other diversity studies (https://pcgin.org/), parents of mutant and mapping populations, and 67 lines comprising selected P. abyssinicum accessions and all accessions designated P. elatius, P. fulvum or Pisum humile (Fig. 1a). We conducted next-generation short-read whole-genome resequencing for these 697 Pisum accessions, generating approximately 80 Gb of clean reads with an average coverage of around 20× for each accession (Supplementary Table 2). We then built a genomic variation map encompassing 154.8 million high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with respect to the ZW6 assembly18, as well as to the inbred pea cultivar Caméor version 1a17 (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 and Supplementary Fig. 1). Population genomic diversity analysis reveals the pattern of accession relationships and population structure at high resolution23 (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). We identify eight major Pisum groups (G1–G8) (Fig. 1b,d), with P. fulvum and P. abyssinicum forming distinct branches within G8. The remaining G8 accessions consist mainly of P. elatius, and G7 includes P.sativum together with other sub-types. P. sativum accessions are widely distributed across the groups G1 to G7. These accessions do not have a simple tree-like relationship, but instead form a reticulated network, reflecting the complex history of crossing and introgression between subgroups (Fig. 1e).

Within the diversity panel, we recorded phenotypic variation for each of Mendel's seven pairs of contrasting traits (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 7). The association of this phenotypic diversity with genomic data (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Tables 8–12), coupled with linkage analysis from bi-parental mapping populations and gene functional investigations, elucidated the genetic architecture and allelic variants associated with each of these traits (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 1). We show that, for each trait, a small number of genetic loci contribute to the trait variation.

We confirm the previous interpretations for the four characterized Mendelian genes (R, I, Le and A)2,3,4,5,6,7 and identify novel alleles (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables 13–16). For the R gene, explaining the round versus wrinkled seed phenotype, we detect a single strong, broad signal at the expected genomic position of PsSBEI2 and present the full-length sequence of the Ips-r element inserted in the last exon (Supplementary Fig. 2). R versus r is also the primary determinant of seed protein content variation (Supplementary Fig. 3), suggesting that altered seed starch quality and quantity indirectly affect the ratio of storage protein classes and overall protein content24. For I versus i4,5,6, which corresponds to yellow versus green cotyledons, we characterize two key alleles: i-1 (the insertion of a 5,696-nt TAR element, a Ty1-Copia long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon) and i-2 (a novel 408-bp deletion in the promoter) of the Mg-dechelatase gene (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5). The phenotypic variability associated with these alleles, driven by transcriptional differences and confounding genetic and environmental factors is described in Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7. For the A gene, which encodes a bHLH transcription factor that is responsible for the presence or absence of anthocyanin pigmentation (A versus a)7, we present several novel alleles (Supplementary Fig. 8), including a rare intragenic suppressor mutation that restores the most abundant a allele to a functional wild-type A allele (Supplementary Fig. 9). Finally, for the Le gene, which encodes GA 3-oxidase1 (also known as GA 3β-hydroxylase), we observe five haplotypes (Supplementary Fig. 10), but the reduced-height le variants were exclusively found in haplotype 1, which carries the known G > A substitution at chromosome (chr.) 5:639,901,919.

We investigated the gene identities and allelic variants underlying three of Mendel's seven traits that remained poorly characterized16: ‘the difference in the colour of the unripe pod' (Gp); ‘the difference in the shape of the ripe pod' (conditioned by either of two loci, P or V); and ‘the difference in the position of the flowers' (thought to be conditioned by either of two loci, Fa or Fas).

Although Gp is usually discussed in relation to pod colour, Mendel noted that this is just one feature of the gp mutant1. In mature flowering and fruiting plants, yellow tissues are seen in the petiole, rachis, tendrils and leaflet midribs of young leaves, as well as in the pedicel, peduncle and sepals (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 11). There are also substantial differences in chloroplast development25, as well as in the physiological and biochemical properties of pod and leaf tissues between green (Gp/Gp) and yellow-podded (gp/gp) varieties (Fig. 3b,c). Here we found that even the green leaves of gp lines show disturbed development of thylakoid membranes (Supplementary Fig. 12), which correlates with a productivity difference between Gp and gp isolines (Supplementary Fig. 13).

ChlGWT and ChlGW121* represent the wild-type and TILLING alleles of ChlG. WT represents the presence of the wild-type (Caméor) sequence between ChlG and the TIR-NBS-LRR gene, and Δgp represents the approximately 100-kb deletion, which co-segregates with gp. The question being addressed is whether ChlGW121*-WT complements gp (ChlGWT-Δgp). f, F1 pods segregating for green versus yellow. The number after the underscore is the plant number; the parental lines (TILL_6 het and JI0015) and wild-type Caméor are also shown. g, Codominant PCR marker test confirming that all plants presumed to be F1 are Gp/gp heterozygotes (top) and a dCAPS marker PCR test confirming that only the yellow-podded F1 plants inherited the ChlGW121* TILLING allele (bottom). M, DNA size marker (0.5 – 3 kb; 100 bp ladder lane from 1 kb to 0.5 kb and below).

All yellow-podded lines in the John Innes Pisum germplasm collection were found to be allelic to gp, confirming that there is only one known yellow pod locus and here we show that there is only one gp allele. Genetic mapping and association genomics analysis found that all yellow-podded lines carried a deletion of around 100 kb within the GWAS interval that co-segregated with gp (Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15 and Supplementary Tables 17–22). With respect to the ZW6 assembly, this large genomic deletion removes one Ogre LTR retrotransposon and an open reading frame encoding a partial NBS-LRR gene, as well as part of exon 5 and the whole of exons 6 and 7 from a gene encoding a TIR-NBS-LRR protein (NLR (also known as Psat03G0414100)) (Fig. 3d).

This deletion is adjacent to the chlorophyll synthase gene (ChlG (also known as Psat03G0413700)), but the ChlG gene is structurally intact in all gp lines, with its encoded amino acid sequence being identical to the wild type. Mapping RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) reads of the gp lines JI0015 and JI2366 to their matched genome assemblies predicted novel transcripts and isoform variants, including alternative splicing within the NLR–ChlG region (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 16). Transcriptional fusions, generated by intergenic splicing between the truncated NLR and ChlG, breakpoint read-through of the truncated NLR transcript, and intron read-through of ChlG transcripts were confirmed by PCR with reverse transcription and cDNA sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 17 and Supplementary Table 23–25). It can be predicted that the encoded fusion or truncated ChlG proteins would not participate in chlorophyll biosynthesis, nor would they insert into the thylakoid membrane owing to either internalization or the lack of the transit peptide (Supplementary Fig. 18). RNA-seq and quantitative PCR (qPCR) data showed that in gp pods, functional ChlG transcript abundance was reduced to about 6% of that in the wild type (Fig. 3d). In gp mutants, the intact t0 transcript was more abundant in leaves compared with pods but the fused NLR–ChlG t1 and t2 transcript levels were similar in pods and leaves (Supplementary Fig. 19 and Supplementary Tables 26 and 27). We propose that transcriptional interference and aberrant transcripts disrupt ChlG function and chlorophyll synthesis, causing the yellowness of otherwise green tissues in the gp mutant.

To test whether Gp corresponds to ChlG, we obtained a TILLING (targeting-induced local lesions in genomes) mutant26 with a premature stop codon (W121*) in ChlG (Fig. 3e). This mutant could not be recovered as a homozygote, although the mutant allele was transmitted through both pollen and egg cells. We conclude that the homozygous mutation is embryo lethal, but not lethal in either gametophyte. We reasoned that the phenotype of a ∆gp/Gp, ChlGwt/ChlGW121* double heterozygote would be informative; if Gp did not correspond to ChlG, then the plant should be viable and green-podded, refuting our hypothesis. Conversely, if Gp did correspond to a functional ChlG, then it should be yellow-podded. Of the 16 F1 progeny that we derived from the cross between gp/gp and the TILLING mutant heterozygotes, 10 had yellow pods, and all yellow-podded F1 plants carried the ChlGW121* null allele (Fig. 3f,g). This result supported our hypothesis and confirmed that the gp mutant does not provide a fully functional ChlG.

The evidence presented above demonstrates that a ChlG deficiency mediates the mutant phenotype and establishes that ChlG is allelic to Gp. The wild-type alleles of other genes in the vicinity cannot rescue the gp mutant phenotype. While the detailed molecular and regulatory mechanism underlying this defect in chlorophyll synthesis remains to be established, our current understanding predicts that ablation of the NLR gene in a gp mutant, thereby removing the fused NLR–ChlG transcripts, would restore the wild-type green pod colour.

In 1537, Ruel described the difference in the shape of the ripe pod as “Valvulae etia recetes eorum quae nullo pedameto fulciuntur, ante que durescat, edendo sunt”27; roughly translated, this means “Those where the valves provide little support are to be eaten before they harden”, indicating that as today, these were vegetable peas. The lack of a sclerenchyma layer (pod parchment) is conditioned by the recessive allele at either (or both) of the genes: P and V16. It is uncertain which of these genes Mendel was discussing; he could have worked with either, or perhaps both. Our GWAS analysis identified regions that are statistically correlated with this phenotype, two of which correspond significantly to the expected positions of P and V (Fig. 2b), suggesting that both p and v alleles are relatively common. Additional signals detected may correspond to genes affecting pod wall thickness (N) or structure (Sin)28 (Extended Data Fig. 2a).

Within our 8.3 Mb GWAS peak on chromosome 1, the gene Psat01G0420500 had the greatest significance, which is consistent with a 0.92 Mb interval defined in the JI2822 × JI0816 F2 mapping population (Extended Data Fig. 2b–d). Psat01G0420500 encodes a dodeca-CLE peptide that is identical to the tracheary element differentiation inhibitory factor (TDIF) of Arabidopsis CLE4121,29 (designated here as PsCLE41; Supplementary Fig. 20). One allele within this single-exon gene, which carries an in-frame premature stop codon (R79*) upstream of the TDIF motif (Extended Data Fig. 2e–g), fully explains the p phenotype. CLE41 or CLE44 peptides are known to repress the formation of xylem30 in Arabidopsis thaliana and specify positional information that determines the rate and orientation of cell divisions in vascular tissue in conjunction with the receptor kinase PXY31. TDIF is proposed to function as a non-cell autonomous signalling peptide controlling cell fate32 and lignification33. This suggests a model for P whereby this TDIF peptide interacts with a PXY-like protein to specify pea pod sclerenchyma development via the established TDIF–PXY–WOX signalling pathway34,35.

The genomic interval corresponding to V, as identified by GWAS, spans a broad region (chromosome 6, 610–650 Mb) within which the most significant 2-Mb segment (chromosome 6, 629–631 Mb) overlaps with a 1.25-Mb interval (chromosome 6, 629.23–630.48 Mb) defined by an F2 mapping population36, narrowing the V candidate region (Extended Data Fig. 3a–e). A detailed haplotype–phenotype association study within this interval excluded several previously proposed gene candidates (Supplementary Tables 28 and 29 and Supplementary Fig. 21). We found that accessions with parchmentless pods, with or without the R79* mutation (ppvv or PPvv), are clustered into a single haplotype (Extended Data Fig. 3g) for Psat05G0804500, a homologue of the Arabidopsis MYB26 gene (referred to here as PsMYB26, which has also been designated as PsMYB73 (ref. 37; Supplementary Fig. 22). AtMYB26, which encodes a master transcription factor that directly activates its downstream NAC-domain transcription factors in A. thaliana38, has been reported to promote secondary wall thickening and lignification of the endothelium, and MYB26 is required for sclerenchyma formation in legume pods39. PsMYB26 exhibits tissue-specific expression in the pod endocarp and is the most highly differentially expressed gene between wild-type (P/P V/V) pods and mutant (P/P v/v) pods (Extended Data Fig. 3f,h and Supplementary Tables 30 and 31). RNA-seq and qPCR with reverse transcription (RT–qPCR) analyses of both P/P v/v and p/p v/v mutant lines both show reduced expression of PsMYB26 and the PsNAC (Supplementary Information) compared with wild-type P/P V/V lines (Extended Data Fig. 4a–f and Supplementary Fig. 23). Furthermore, a virus-induced gene-silencing (VIGS) experiment followed by RT–qPCR analyses demonstrated the downregulation of PsMYB26 and PsNAC genes in the silenced lines (Extended Data Fig. 4g). PsMYB26 is downregulated in p/p V/V mutant lines, suggesting that PsMYB26 and PsNAC have a role in controlling the parchmentless phenotype and supporting an epistatic relationship between PsCLE41 and PsMYB26 (Extended Data Fig. 4f–h).

A 23 kb Ogre-type LTR retrotransposon insertion, located upstream of PsMYB26 and with the same polarity, is present in all P/P v/v genotypes in our diversity panel (Supplementary Fig. 24 and Supplementary Tables 32 and 33). Although PsMYB26 and the associated Ogre insertion are strong candidates for V, further work is needed to fully elucidate the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the v allele.

Mendel used the name Pisum umbellatum when describing “the position of the flowers” on the stem of pea, a term previously used by Gerard40 to describe the fasciated form with an umbellate inflorescence. Fasciation in pea can vary in its severity, from stem bifurcation to an extreme clustering of flowers at the apex. There are several pea genes that, when mutant, confer a fasciated phenotype; of these, Fa (chromosome 4, linkage group IV) is considered to be the gene Mendel studied41,42.

GWAS analysis identified a broad signal (chromosome 4, 0–40 Mb) (Fig. 2b) that underwent further refinement through investigation of F2 populations. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) narrowed this region down to a 15-Mb interval (Supplementary Fig. 25) and fine mapping led to the delineation of a 1.33 Mb candidate interval (chromosome 4, 18.18–19.51 Mb, ZW6) (Extended Data Fig 5a–e and Supplementary Tables 18–20, 34 and 35). Within this 1.33-Mb interval, we found that all fasciated accessions were clustered together within haplotype 5 (Extended Data Fig. 5f); however, accession JI1713, also in haplotype 5, usually is not fasciated (see below). Analysis of each gene within this interval showed that only one gene, Psat04G0031700, co-segregated with fasciation. All fasciated accessions are clustered into Hap 3 of this gene, which is characterized by a 5-bp deletion in exon 2, creating a frameshift and premature stop codon, rendering the protein non-functional and explaining fasciation in fa lines (Extended Data Fig. 5g,h and Supplementary Table 36). This gene encodes a cell membrane-localized senescence-associated receptor-like kinase, a class of CLAVATA3 INSENSITIVE RECEPTOR KINASES (CIK) signalling (co-)receptor kinases, known for their role in maintaining the structure of the shoot apical meristem43 (designated as PsCIK2/3; Supplementary Fig. 26). Field phenotyping and microscopic observations of fasciated versus wild-type plants showed that the bunched apical flowers of the mutant are borne on a wider stem with additional vascular strands, derived from a broadened apical meristem (Extended Data Fig. 6a–e). Comparative transcriptome analysis in Caméor revealed high expression of PsCIK2/3, CLV3 and PsCLV2 in the stem (Extended Data Fig. 6f and Supplementary Tables 30 and 31). PsCLV1, also expressed in stems, showed its highest expression in root, whereas PsWUS is uniquely expressed in apical bud. RT–qPCR analysis showed that PsCIK2/3 expression was significantly downregulated in both the apical bud and stem of the mutant line (JI0814, fa/fa) compared with a wild-type line (Caméor), whereas PsCLV3 was significantly ‘upregulated' in the apical bud of the mutant line (Extended Data Fig. 6f–h). The ‘upregulation' likely reflects the enlarged size of the fasciated apical meristem, although further investigation in pea is needed to clarify this point. Interactions between PsCIK2/3 and both PsCLV1 and PsCLV2 (Extended Data Fig. 6i,j) were revealed by yeast two-hybrid assays. We hypothesize that PsCIK2/3 functions within the conserved meristem homeostasis CLV3-WUS genetic regulatory pathway (Supplementary Fig. 27), regulating shoot apex development and meristem structure maintenance44.

A second minor GWAS signal was detected on chromosome 6, a region that was not previously associated with fasciation (Fig. 2). This genomic region was also identified in our bi-parental mapping populations (Extended Data Fig. 7a). In the JI2822 (Fa) × JI0816 (fa) F2 population, we observed that out of 397 individuals scored, 32 exhibited a wild-type phenotype but carried the recessive allele at fa (Supplementary Tables 18–20), which is consistent with the GWAS and BSA studies. This suggests a model whereby the recessive allele of a gene in this region of chr6LGII masks the fasciated phenotype. Accordingly, we designated this enigmatic second locus as modifier of fa (mfa). In this model, individuals that are recessive for both loci—the fa/fa mfa/mfa genotype—have a wild-type appearance (Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). This may also explain why some accessions, such as JI1713, that carry the 5 bp deletion in Psat04G0031700 (PsCIK2/3) usually are not fasciated, incidentally accounting for the secondary GWAS peak. Previous studies have highlighted complexity in the segregation of fasciation, with reports of both reversals of dominance and 2-factor segregation ratios (15:1), rather than the expected 1-factor segregation ratio (3:1), in F2 populations for some crosses45. These unusual features may, in part, be explained by the previously unrecognized gene Mfa. The nature of Mfa remains to be determined, but it resides within the interval ZW6 chr. 6:244,689,457-253,701,016 identified in this study.

In the F3 generation, the Fa–Mfa genetic model successfully explains the observed phenotypes on the basis of the genetic marker data (Extended Data Fig. 7). The fa/fa mfa/mfa genotypes can appear wild type, on the basis of the position of lateral inflorescence, but may also exhibit some features of fasciation, demonstrating an incomplete penetrance or variable expressivity of mfa, which requires further investigation. We propose that mfa/mfa homozygotes either delay or prevent the formation of structures that would cause a fa/fa plant to be scored as a fasciated phenotype (Supplementary Notes).

It has been argued that Mendel's motivation in studying inheritance was related to an applied plant breeding programme46. To connect further the traits and genes discovered in pea with their agronomic interests and breeding values, we analysed 72 additional agriculturally relevant traits, including seed, pod, flower, leaf, root and plant architecture characteristics measured within our Pisum diversity panel (Extended Data Fig. 8a–c and Supplementary Table 37). A comprehensive GWAS established hundreds of significant marker–trait associations (Supplementary Table 38) including 14 previously cloned genes (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Tables 39 and 40) and determined the physical locations of 22 loci that were previously known from classical genetics to within an average genomic interval of 12 Mb. In addition to the four newly characterized genes associated with three of Mendel's pea traits, our study uncovered dozens of potentially important new loci, many with breeding implications. For example, the SDN locus (seed number per pod) and SDY locus (seed total weight per plant) related to yield components (Extended Data Fig. 8g,i and Supplementary Table 39). The organ size locus (Os1), which controls pod width and seed weight, is validated below. These results demonstrate the high quality of our dataset, and the robustness of the association genomics analyses, laying a solid foundation for future functional elucidation of pea traits and their application in breeding programs.

Source data

In his 1866 paper, Mendel noted the pleiotropic effects of the seed coat and flower colour trait (A versus a) and specifically referred to the presence or absence of axil ring pigmentation as one of these effects. The A gene regulates the presence or absence of anthocyanin pigmentation throughout the plant and a is epistatic to D, which regulates the pattern of axil ring pigmentation45. Axil pigmentation patterns in pea (Supplementary Fig. 29) are reminiscent of leaf marking in Trifolium47 and Medicago48, which are controlled by similar MYB transcription factors.

GWAS analysis revealed two strong signals associated with axil ring pigmentation (in coloured flower lines) (Fig. 4c). One of these corresponds to A (chromosome 6), whereas the other is at the expected position of D (chromosome 2), where there is a cluster of MYB genes49 (Supplementary Fig. 30 and Supplementary Table 41). The potential role of one of these MYB genes was investigated further by VIGS, which showed that the MYB-encoding gene Psat02G0138300 (also known as PsMYB16) affects the accumulation of the axil ring anthocyanin pigmentation (Supplementary Fig. 31). Furthermore, deletion of another two MYB genes at the same locus, PsMYB104 and PsMYB106 (ref. 37, in the induced Fast Neutron mutant line FN1218/6 resulted in the complete absence of axil ring pigmentation (Supplementary Figs. 32–34). We show that the FN1218/6 deletion is allelic to the d allele in JI0073 and JI2202 (P. abyssinicum, a taxon that lacks axil ring pigmentation) (Fig. 4d), implicating these genes as corresponding to D.

The results presented here reveal the genetic complexity of axil ring pigmentation regulated by D. There are multiple alleles of D within the MYB gene cluster, and many spontaneous conversions from one allelic form to another have been reported45, suggesting that it is the combination of alleles at several of these MYB genes that determines the presence, absence or pattern of this pigmentation. Both a and a2 are epistatic to D, and we can postulate that the MYB genes involved in the D and d phenotypes are part of a MYB (D)–bHLH (A)–WD40 (A2) complex7,50.

Mendel examined the segregation of traits that have clear alternative states but noted that seed size (among other traits) differed between his parental lines, although he considered that this quantitative difference was not suitable for his analyses. Seed size in pea defines some market classes, such as the ‘marrowfat' types, which have large, irregular-shaped seeds and a high protein content. Seed size has been the subject of quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses51, and we have investigated this further within our diversity panel.

We found a significant locus on chromosome 2 that influences both pod width and hundred seed weight (HSW) (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 35), which is in a similar location to a previously described seed size QTL in Medicago and pea52. We designated this locus as PsOs1. Combining fine mapping and differential gene expression analysis, we identified Psat02G0011300, which encodes a SIAMESE-related protein (SIM or SMR), a cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor (CKI), that influences cell division and enlargement during the cell cycle and consequently alters plant cell size53, as a gene candidate for PsOs1 (Fig. 4g, Supplementary Figs. 36–38 and Supplementary Tables 42 and 43). VIGS-based functional validation, coupled with a transgenic overexpression line in Arabidopsis (Supplementary Figs. 39–42) demonstrate the key role of PsOs1 in regulating seed weight and pod width.

The adoption of afila types represents the most important innovation in modern pea breeding54. These types include the ‘leafless' (af/af st/st) and ‘semi-leafless' (af/af St/St) varieties54. Figure 4b shows a strong GWAS signal for this character at the expected position of Af (afila) at the end of chromosome 2. In addition to the five haplotypes (Hap1–5) corresponding to the wild-type phenotypes (Af), our analysis identified three deletion haplotypes (Hap6, Hap7 and Hap8), which correspond to hap_4, hap_2 and hap_3, respectively54 (Supplementary Figs. 43 and 44), all of which remove the genes PALM1a and PALM1b, associated with the recessive allele (af). These deletion haplotypes are the most abundant and appear in similar relative proportions here and in the previous analysis54.

The presence of multiple af haplotypes confirmed independent origins of the afila alleles. Here, we refined the deletion end points at a nucleotide level resolution for the 30 afila lines showing that these haplotypes are not further differentiated by their deletion end points; the gene content of the deleted segments is thus more precisely defined (Supplementary Tables 44 and 45). This is important because afila alleles delete different combinations of flanking genes, notably PsNaOD1, PsNaOD2 and PsNaOD3, which affect seed yield and seed weight55.

Despite the clarity of his 1866 paper, there is some dispute about what Mendel did in his detailed research. It has been argued that Mendel was not primarily interested in inheritance56,57, or that he had a pre-formed theory of inheritance that he sought to demonstrate, even to the extent of fabricating data to conform with his theory58. These views are mutually exclusive, and we reject them both46,59.

We have shown a remarkable diversity of mutational mechanisms in the genes associated with the seven pairs of contrasting traits that Mendel studied. There are several point mutations in a, one affecting the pattern of splicing and two different single nucleotide insertions affecting the reading frame, whereas le corresponds to an amino acid substitution caused by a missense mutation. There is a single nucleotide substitution that generates a premature stop codon in the CLE41 gene at the P locus, and insertion events of class I (i and v) and class II (r) transposons have been observed2,5. We have also uncovered additional novel types of variation, corresponding to DNA deletions that lead to loss of function, such as the remarkable case of gp, with a large DNA deletion upstream of ChlG, a promoter deletion in the i-2 allele, the fa allele, with a small deletion within an exon, and new alleles of a, with one or more deleted exons. An unexpected finding in this study was the existence of an intragenic suppressor allele of A that implies that the a allele was in existence long enough for this unlikely second site mutation to have occurred. This intragenic suppressor mutation corresponds to a shift in the position of an intron, which is rarely identified, even in inter-specific comparisons of many genes60.

The biological processes that these genes represent range from variation in the activity of enzymes in primary metabolism (r, i and gp), hormone interconversion (le), transcription factors for regulation of secondary metabolism (a) and cell wall thickening (v), the regulation of cell fate by a small signalling peptide (p), and a cell membrane (co-)receptor kinase (fa). The two green-versus-yellow phenotypic differences (cotyledon or pod colour) correspond to disruption in either the final step of chlorophyll synthesis (gp) or the first step of chlorophyll degradation (i). This difference between synthesis versus degradation explains which phenotype, green or yellow, corresponds to the dominant versus recessive allele. Although the elucidation of the biochemical and regulatory mechanisms underlying these genes is beyond the scope of this study, the genomic and genetic discoveries presented here are essential for advancing our understanding of Mendel's pea traits. For example, on the basis of the discovery of the fused aberrant transcripts arising from the NLR–CHLG genomic region, we propose that transcript stability is altered by transcriptional interference during chlorophyll synthesis or through a nonsense-mediated decay pathway, leading to an increased degradation rate of ChlG transcripts.

A longstanding question in relation to Mendel's pea work was whether the phenotypic variation he described corresponded to rare variants of genes that explain only a minor proportion of the genetic variation for that trait. Our GWAS analyses emphatically show that this is not the case. Indeed, in one case in which genetic heterogeneity was expected (fasciation), the variation that we detected corresponded to a single genetic locus (Fa), albeit with a previously unsuspected modifier locus (Mfa). There are three caveats to this claim. The first is that the parchmentless pod trait is (as has long been known) determined by either p or v, or the combination of these two distinct and independent genetic loci. A second caveat is that for the green versus yellow cotyledon phenotype, there are clearly multiple GWAS peaks, albeit with lower significance than that of I. This probably reflects the influence of the seed maturation process on the penetrance of this phenotype, as was noted by Mendel in his 1866 paper. Finally, we observed an unusual feature of the GWAS peak corresponding to Gp, where there is a broad shoulder corresponding to most of the short arm of this chromosome. The reason for this is unknown.

This raises two general questions regarding GWAS analyses in defining genetic variation underlying traits: whether broad GWAS peaks provide sufficient resolution to identify a manageable number of candidate genes; and how the positions of significant GWAS signals correspond to previously described genetic variants. We have seen that for the seven Mendelian traits (and D), the GWAS peaks are significant, and all correspond well to the expected genetic loci. Furthermore, in our broad survey of many other agronomic traits for genotype–phenotype associations, nearly all the GWAS peaks correspond to the location of previously described genetic loci. This demonstrates that pea is an excellent model system for association genomics studies and GWAS is a suitable first step for trait–gene discovery and functional elucidation. The reliability of GWAS in pea is partly due to the fact that an unusually high proportion of pea genes are single copy17, even though the pea genome is large and gene density is low throughout the chromosomes, maintaining a strong extended linkage disequilibrium. Presumably this is in part because of the strict inbreeding habit of pea.

We have shown how complementary approaches can narrow down these intervals to identify candidate genes. For the genes characterized in this study, GWAS intervals alone were insufficient to delineate small sets of candidate genes. Additional resources and experimental approaches are necessary, such as induced mutants and specific bi-parental mapping populations, comparative transcriptomes, and genetic functional validation. Future work will require innovative approaches and new technologies, such as long-read DNA and RNA sequencing, which could address the limitations of short-read sequencing technologies and are crucial for investigating how large-scale structural variations and transposons contribute to phenotypic changes. Furthermore, a mature genetic transformation system and targeted gene editing in pea are urgently needed. These tools would enable a detailed examination of the biochemical genetics underlying complex mutations, such as the aberrant transcripts produced at the gp locus, the MYB gene clusters at the D locus, and the LTR retrotransposon insertion upstream of the gene encoding the transcription factor MYB26 (V locus).

We leveraged the rich reservoir of genetic diversity from a global Pisum diversity panel and established a high-quality genomic and phenotypic variation map. The large numbers of genotype–phenotype associations that we have found represent the beginning of a new phase of systematic trait dissection at the molecular level in pea. This genotype-to-phenotype strategy can be expanded, with the identified genes and alleles projected into other crops, particularly legumes. This study is essential for pea basic research, education in biology and genetics, and breeding practices.

A total of 697 accessions, maximizing genetic diversity, were selected from the JI Pisum Germplasm Collection for this study (Supplementary Table 1 and https://www.seedstor.ac.uk/). These germplasm accessions were introduced in 2019 to the Agricultural Genomics Institute at Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, China, where they are grown and investigated annually.

Genomic DNA was extracted from approximately 50 mg leaf tissue of 3-week-old seedlings. Extraction used the oKtopure system (LGC Biosearch Technology) following tissue desiccation with silica for 48 h. A bespoke protocol was used with the following volumes per sample: 250 µl lysis buffer, 170 µl binding buffer, 20 µl sbeadexTM suspension, 300 µl PN1 wash buffer, 300 µl PN2 wash buffer, 300 µl PN2 wash buffer (×3 wash cycles) and using 75 µl final elution buffer. For each accession, a minimum of 6 μg of genomic DNA was used to construct a 150-bp paired-end sequencing library with an insert size of 500 bp, following the manufacturer's protocols (employing PCR-free methods), which was subsequently sequenced on the DNBSEQ Platform at BGI-Shenzhen resulting in ~80 Gb clean reads with a coverage of ~20× for each accession.

DNA was extracted from a single plant whose seed was bulked up for progeny phenotyping. The diversity panel was planted in three different sites, Norwich, UK (52.62° N, 1.28° E), Shenzhen (Southern China, 22.61° N, 114.51° E) and Harbin (northern China, 45.86° N, 126.83° E). In China, four rounds of phenotyping were conducted. Specific subsets of accessions and some F2 populations were grown indoors in the greenhouse of Shenzhen Agricultural Field Farm, with 16 h of light/8 h of darkness. Phenotypes collected at the three stations (2020–2023) and a historical JIC phenotype dataset were curated in Seedstor (https://www.seedstor.ac.uk/). In Shenzhen, peas were planted in winter (October) and harvested in March the following year, whereas in Norwich and Harbin they were planted in spring (March to April) and harvested in August to October of the same year.

For the phenotyping of pod colour (green versus yellow-podded lines), a field trial of three 1 m2 microplots of 100 seeds each was sown in spring 2023, in which a 1:1 ratio of BC6 S3 Gp/Gp and gp/gp seeds (selfed seed of S2 homozygotes) were mixed and sown at random in each plot. At the pod filling stage, the Gp plants were tagged and at plot harvest seed was collected from individual plants to determine the yield of Gp and gp homozygotes. Seeds were weighed and counted on a Data Count R25+ machine (https://data-technologies.com/). Pod length and width were measured on 25 randomly selected pods. For the phenotyping of organ size, pod width (PW) and HSW were measured in mature pods of the F2 and F2:3 populations after harvest. In the F2 populations, PW was assessed using 15 representative pods, divided into 3 groups of 5, with the total width of each group measured sequentially. For the F2:3 populations, PW was determined using 5 representative pods, with their total width measured in a similar manner. HSW was calculated by randomly weighing 100 seeds from each accession and repeating the process 3 times to obtain an average weight for each accession. Other more specific phenotypes were collected as described in Supplementary Table 37 and in line with published descriptors (https://www.seedstor.ac.uk/search-phenotypes.php).

The trimmed clean reads of each accession were aligned against the reference genome of pea (P. sativum) cultivar, ZW6 (ref. 18) and Caméor v.1.0 (ref. 17), using BWA-MEM (v.0.7.17) with default parameters63. Unmapped, non-unique and duplicated reads were filtered out using SAMtools64,65 (v.1.9) and Picard (v.2.20.3-SNAPSHOT) before variants were called by a standard pipeline of Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK65 v.4.1.2) and Sentieon66 (v.202112.01). SNPs were further filtered to remove low-quality variants defined as (1) SNPs with more than two alleles; (2) SNPs with QD < 2.0, FS > 60.0, MQ < 40.0, SOR > 3.0, MQRankSum < −12.5, ReadPosRankSum < −8.0; (3) SNPs with observed heterozygosity (Hobs) exceeding the maximum calculated value (Hobs_max) based on the inbreeding coefficient (F), where F was calculated as 1 − (Hobs/Hexp), with Hexp defined as 2p(1 − p) using the frequency of the non-reference allele, and Hobs_max was determined as 10 × (1 − Fmedian) × Hexp for variants with F > 0 and minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.05; (4) SNPs with missing rate >20% and MAF < 0.01. SnpEff67 (v.4.3t) was used to annotate the SNPs, and functional significance was then categorized on the basis of their positions with respect to genes (intergenic regions, exons, introns, splicing sites, untranslated regions, upstream and downstream regions) and mutation consequences (missense, start codon gain or loss, stop codon gain or loss and splicing mutations).

Small insertion–deletion mutants (indels; ≤50 bp) were called using GATK (v.4.1.2) and filtered following the criteria: QD < 2.0 || low_QD || FS > 200.0 || high_FS || ReadPosRankSum < −20.0 || low_ReadPosRankSum before they were annotated using SnpEff (v.4.3t). Read depth variation from read mapping analysis was used to identify gene presence and absence variation (PAV) and gene copy number variation (CNV) through normalization and correction in statistical analyses, following five steps: (1), mapped read depth at each gene was counted for each accession; (2), a correction for read depth variation (RDV) was applied, accounting for highly similar genes through all-versus-all coding sequence (CDS) alignment using BLASTN. Recently duplicated genes were collapsed into representative genes to minimize depth bias, which were further normalized by dividing the corrected read depth of the gene by the average sequencing depth of the accession; (3) the distribution of read depth versus GC content was used to correct read depth bias for each gene resulting from differential GC contents; (4), read depth variation was corrected for genomic regions with insertions or deletions in the genome reference; (5), subspecies-unique and shared CNVs were characterized by calculating the number of accessions with different copy numbers for each gene within each subspecies.

Different categories of structural variants (SVs: duplication, inversion, translocation and large-scale deletion or insertion) were detected on the basis of read mapping (read depth and read pair relationships) on PCR-duplicate-marked bam files using Delly (v 0.8.7) with default parameters; a summary of SVs identified is given in Supplementary Table 11.

A two-step LD pruning process was implemented to generate a high-quality core SNP dataset for the construction of a haplotype map68. Initially, SNPs were pruned on the basis of linkage disequilibrium (LD) using PLINK69, with a window size of 10 kb, a window step of one SNP, and an r2 threshold of 0.8. A second round of LD pruning was conducted with a window size of 50 kb, a window step of one SNP, and the same r2 threshold of 0.8. For population LD-based haplotype analysis, the filtered SNPs were phased using Beagle (v.21Apr21.304)70. Subsequently, haplotype blocks were delineated utilizing PLINK with specific parameters (--blocks no-pheno-req --blocks-max-kb 1000 --geno 0.1 --blocks-min-maf 0.05). To merge adjacent blocks maintaining significant LD, D' statistic values were calculated between all SNPs of consecutive blocks. If the lower quartile (Q1) exceeded 0.98, the adjacent blocks were merged. After filtering for the inbreeding coefficient, HAPPE71 was employed to identify haplotype clusters (haplogroups) for each block.

Lines JI0816 and JI2822 (Supplementary Table 18), both of short stature, are maintained in the John Innes Pisum germplasm collection (https://www.seedstor.ac.uk/). JI0816, also known as WBH 1185, has pink flowers, a fasciated stem and yellow pods lacking pod parchment, corresponding to the mutant alleles b, fa, gp and p, respectively. JI2822, a recombinant inbred line derived from the cross JI0015 × JI0399, is wild type at these four loci. JI0015 and JI0816 share the gp allele, indicating that these two lines had a common parent; therefore segments of the genetic map are devoid of segregating alleles. 1,000 F2 seeds from 9 F1 plants (JI2822 × JI0816) were sown at the JIC field station in spring 2022. DNA preps from 942 plants were prepared from individual leaflets using the Qiagen DNeasy protocol (https://www.qiagen.com). Of these, 405 were genotyped using an Axiom SNP array as described49. The phenotypic and genotypic data are available in Supplementary Tables 18–20, and the sequences corresponding to the Axiom markers are available in supplementary table 3 of Ellis et al.49.

Three populations have been used for mapping Gp. The first to be used was the previously described recombinant inbred population JI0015 × JI0399 (Supplementary Table 21), later genotyped by Neogen, using an Infinium array as described previously51. The second was an F2 population derived from a cross between two of these RILs (JI2822 Gp/Gp and JI2833 gp/gp), which was screened using PCR for markers already mapped in JI0015 × JI0399 in order to identify informative individuals (Supplementary Table 22). These, together with selected RILs with informative recombination events were genotyped with Axiom markers as described elsewhere49,65. Gp also segregates in the JI2822 × JI0816 F2 population as described above. The marker data are available in the supplementary file: Gp mapping in JI0015 × JI0399 (Supplementary Tables 21 and 22).

We selected parental lines with contrasting pairs of traits to map genetic loci of interest in F2 populations using mapping by sequencing72 of bulked segregants. For genetic loci controlling uncharacterized Mendel traits: flower position (axial versus terminal), pod colour (yellow versus green), and pod shape (inflated versus constricted), crosses were made between Caméor (axial) × JI0814 (fasciated) and JI1995 (green pod) × JI2366 (yellow pod). F2 populations for the P/V loci (pod shape) were derived from the cross between JI0074 (P/P v/v) as the male parent and JI1995 (P/P V/V) as the female parent, and the cross between JI2822 × JI0816. F2 populations for the D locus (one (Dco) or two (Dw) axial rings of anthocyanin pigmentation) were derived from three crosses, with JI0191 (Dw), JI0794 (Dw) and JI1669 (Dw) as male parents and JI0328 (Dco) as the female parent. F2 populations for the Fn/Fna loci (flower number per node, fpn) were derived from four crosses, with JI0441 (1fpn), JI2410 (3fpn), JI0745 (2fpn) and JI0746 (3fpn) as male parents and JI1995 (2fpn) as the female parent. The marker and BSA analysis of the F2 population is as described36.

Approximately 300 plants from the F2 population of each of these crosses were planted in Shenzhen, China. Wild-type and mutant bulked DNA samples were prepared by mixing equal amounts of DNA from 30 accessions with the dominant and recessive phenotypes, respectively. DNA was isolated from fresh leaves using the CTAB method73. 50× depth genome sequences for each of the parents and the bulked samples were generated. Short reads were aligned against the ZW6 reference genome using BWA-MEM (v.0.7.17) and SNPs were identified using Samtools (v.1.9). The variation dataset was analysed using the G's value method of the QTLseqr package (v.0.7.5.2).

Green versus yellow pod colour segregates in the recombinant inbred (RIL) population derived from the cross between JI0015 (gp/gp) and JI0399 (Gp/Gp). The JI0015 × JI0399 RIL population comprises 90 recombinant inbred lines, which, together with their parents, were genotyped using an Infinium array (Neogen) that detected 13,204 biallelic SNPs. This enabled us to position 5,209 PsCam markers on a genetic map (JI0015 × JI0399) and place Gp between the markers PsCam005046 and PsCam056084 (and their co-segregating markers). Additional mapping was undertaken, using an Axiom SNP array with 84,691 features49 of selected F2 progeny of a cross between JI2822 (Gp) and JI2833 (gp) together with RILs from JI0015 × JI0399 known to have recombination events at informative locations. JI2822 and JI2833 are both RILs from the JI0015 × JI0399 population. With respect to the ZW6 assembly18, this placed Gp between the Axiom markers AX-183865165 (chr. 2:320968993) and AX-183571028 (chr. 3:325580858) (JI0015 × JI0399). Analysis of an F2 population derived from crosses between JI2822 (Gp) and JI0816 (gp) placed Gp between the Axiom markers AX-183571050 (chr. 3:321020350) and AX-183879077, (chr. 3:324762848; Supplementary Table 18).

We performed different association genomics analysis for pod colours, including the SNP-based GWAS, LD-based haplotype GWAS, kmer-derived IBS-based haplotype GWAS, and the SV-based GWAS (Supplementary Fig. 14), all resulting in consistent and significant single GWAS peaks for pod colour located in the expected position of Gp, as seen in Manhattan plots (Supplementary Fig. 14).

Crosses were made between pairs of yellow-podded lines in the JIC germplasm collection (Supplementary Table 18). Seed and vegetative phenotypes were used to identify F1 progeny plants, and those accessions allelic, or non-allelic, to gp were identified by their yellow or green pod colour, respectively.

The JI0015 gp allele was introgressed into the Caméor background by sequential back-crossing and F1 progeny testing using a codominant PCR marker assay with one forward (25994_F) and two reverse (25994_15R and 25994_399R) primers (Supplementary Table 18). Gp (596 bp) and gp (688 bp) alleles were distinguished in a 35 cycle, 10s–30s–60s Touchdown PCR reaction that reduces the initial 62 °C annealing temperature to 50 °C in the first 10 cycles.

The organ size-related quantitative trait locus (PsOs1) was fine-mapped using 21 Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) markers for SNPs distinguishing accessions JI0074 and JI1995 after whole-genome resequencing in the candidate region. Each KASP marker was designed with two allele-specific forward primers (Supplementary Table 47) and one common reverse primer, on the basis of 200-bp sequences upstream and downstream of target genic SNPs, following the standards of LGC Biosearch Technologies. The genetic linkage map was constructed using JoinMap v.4.0 software. Windows QTL Cartographer v.2.5 software facilitated inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) for identifying and analysing QTLs. A logarithm of odds (LOD) score of ≥3.0 was deemed indicative of a QTL.

The multi-location and multi-season phenotypic dataset was used to perform GWASs with the SNP matrix using GEMMA (v.0.98.1)74, and employing the following parameters (gemma-0.98.1-linux-static -miss 0.9 –gk -o kinship.txt and gemma-0.98.1-linux-static -miss 0.9 -lmm -k kinship.txt). The structural variation matrix was used to test for association with phenotypic variation for each of the selected traits using the same parameters as above. The haplotype map was used to test for association with phenotypic variation for each of the selected traits using RTM-GWAS75 with the following parameters (rtm-gwas-gsc –vcf in.vcf –out out.matrix and rtm-gwas-assoc –vcf in.vcf --covar out.matrix.evec --no-gxe). We used GEMMA's Wald tests and directly visualized the resulting P values as –log10-transformed values in Manhattan plots. In-house R scripts were employed for data plotting. To identify SNPs of interest, we applied a Bonferroni correction to the significance threshold (α = 0.1) based on the total number of tested variants (9,214,461 SNPs). This yielded a threshold of –log10(0.1/9,214,461), and any SNP surpassing this cutoff was considered noteworthy and highlighted in the Manhattan plots.

Phylogenetic analyses were conducted on key gene families in this study, such as MYB, CLE and CIK/SERK, following a consistent workflow. Relevant A. thaliana orthologous genes containing the required domains were retrieved from TAIR (https://www.arabidopsis.org), and profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) were constructed using HMMER (v.3.1b1) on the basis of multiple sequence alignments generated by MAFFT (v.7.475). These HMMs were then employed to identify putative homologues in the pea (P. sativum) ZW6 genome. Multiple sequence alignments for each family were trimmed with trimAl (v.1.5.rev.0), and the best-fit amino acid substitution models were selected using ModelTest-NG (v.0.1.7). Phylogenetic trees were constructed by IQ-TREE (v.2.1.2) with 1,000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates. For synteny analysis for each gene family, we used OrthoFinder (v.2.5.4) to identify orthologous clusters among pea and related legumes (for example, Vicia sativa, Medicago truncatula, Cicer arietinum, Lotus japonicus, Vigna radiata, Phaseolus vulgaris and Glycine max), and visualized collinearity blocks with JCVI (v.1.2.7).

Several Fast Neutron mutants from a population described by Domoney et al.76, were included in this project. These were: FN1453/1sil-like; FN1091/4 lacking axil ring pigmentation, allelic to d; FN1218/6 lacking axil ring pigmentation, allelic to d; FN2026/7coch2 candidate; FN2073/5 lacking axil ring pigmentation, not allelic to d; and FN2076/5VicA FN deletion line.

Crosses were made between pairs of lines lacking axil ring pigmentation (Supplementary Fig. 32) to test for complementation. Where possible, vegetative phenotypes were used to identify F1 progeny plants, and those accessions allelic, or non-allelic, to d were identified by the absence, or presence of pigmented axil rings, respectively.

A reverse genetics screen for the ChlG gene in pea was carried out in an ethane methane sulfonate-mutagenised targeting induced local lesions in genomes (TILLING) population in background Caméor26. Line 411.1, with a G>A mutation 1,900 bp after the ATG, resulting in a W121* nonsense mutation, was identified. Eight M4 seeds were sown and seedlings were genotyped with a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker (Supplementary Table 47). No seedlings were homozygous mutants (signified by a single undigested 1,125-bp band), 6 were heterozygous (signified by 3 bands of sizes 1,125 bp, 699 bp and 426 bp) and 2 were homozygous wild type (signified by 2 bands of sizes 699 bp and 426 bp). A complementation test was carried out by crossing heterozygous seedlings with a homozygous JI0015 gp mutant (13 crosses with male JI0015 and F1 identified by long internodes, and 3 crosses with female JI0015 and F1 identified by yellow cotyledons). Nine out of 16 F1 progeny plants had yellow pods, indicating non-complementation.

VIGS in peas was performed using a published methodology as described previously77. To target genes of interest, a 200–500 bp fragment from the CDS region of each gene were amplified. The primers for VIGS constructs, including VIGS-PsChlG, VIGS-PsOs1, VIGS-PsMYB26 and PsMYB16, are provided in Supplementary Table 47. SpeI/XbaI and EcoRI were used to linearize the pCAPE2 vector, which was kindly provided by Li et al.78, and corresponding fragments of gene targets were ligated into the vector to construct the vectors for VIGS assays. For VIGS-PsChlG, the negative control vector, pCAPE2-Con, was constructed in the same way by replacing the PsChlG fragment in pCAPE2-PsChlG with a 529-bp insert derived from a cDNA fragment of Bean Yellow Mosaic Virus (GenBank accession AJ622899). The positive control vector, pCAPE2-PDS, targeting the phytoene desaturase gene, was also provided by Li et al.78. These vectors were transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens (GV3101) (Shanghai Weidi Biotechnology) and VIGS assays carried out following the protocol described by Constantin et al.79. In brief, Agrobacterium strains carrying these vectors were shaken separately until OD600 = 1.2, followed by the collection and resuspension of the bacteria in injection buffer (NaCl: 10 mM, CaCl2: 10 mM, acetosyringone: 0.1 mM) to a concentration of OD600 = 1.2. After resting for 2–3 h, the solution of pCAPE2-target gene, pCAPE2-PDS (positive control), and pCAPE2-Con (negative control) was mixed with pCAPE1, separately, in equal proportions, and injected into 10-day-old compound leaves of the acceptant lines (Yunnan2070 or JI1995). Specifically, pCAPE1 and pCAPE2 are plasmid vectors used to induce gene silencing in plants such as M. truncatula and P. sativum. After 24 h of darkness, they were transferred to long day conditions. New leaves of positive control plants bleached in about 10 days, indicating successful silencing of PDS. VIGS was employed with the same procedure for PsMYB16 gene within the D locus and VIGS-MYB26 for the V candidate gene. For PsOs1, which is described in detail below, all the gene-specific primers used for VIGS constructs are listed in Supplementary Table 47.

The PsOs1 coding sequence of JI0074 was amplified (primers listed in Supplementary Table 47) and integrated into the pCAMBIA1305 vector, resulting in the pCAMBIA1305-PsOs1JI0074 construct. The plasmid was then introduced into A. tumefaciens GV3101, which was subsequently employed to transform A. thaliana (Col-0) via the floral dip technique. T3 generation homozygous transgenic Arabidopsis lines were selected for measurement of thousand-seed weight and the dimensions of elongated siliques.

The pCAMBIA1305-PsOs1JI1995 vector was constructed using the same methodology, with primers detailed in Supplementary Table 47. Both vectors, pCAMBIA1305-PsOs1JI1995 and pCAMBIA1305-PsOs1JI0074, were introduced into the A. tumefaciens strain GV3101. In these experiments, H2B-mCherry served as a nucleus marker. The agrobacteria were resuspended and infiltrated into Nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal cells using an infiltration buffer consisting of 10 mM MES (pH 5.6), 10 mM MgCl2, and 150 μM acetosyringone, at an OD600 of 0.8. Fluorescence was observed 48 h after infiltration using a confocal laser-scanning microscope.

To compare the promoter activities of JI0074 and JI1995 alleles of PsOs1, we cloned sequences 3,000-bp upstream of the coding region and inserted them into pCAMBIA1300-GUS, resulting in the constructs ProJI0074-GUS and ProJI1995-GUS. These were expressed in Nicotiana tabacum leaves and subsequently stained using a GUS Staining Kit (Coolaber Biotech). GUS activity was quantified using the GUS Gene Quantitative Detection Kit (Coolaber Biotech). For a detailed examination of PsOs1 expression patterns in Arabidopsis, various Arabidopsis tissues were sampled from ProJI0074-GUS transgenic plants. After ethanol decolourization, observations and photographs were taken under a microscope. Details of the primers used are provided in Supplementary Table 47.

Intact nuclei from pea pods were isolated using LB01 lysis buffer (Coolaber Biotech), followed by RNA removal and subsequent propidium iodide staining. The nuclei were then quantified using a CytoFLEX flow cytometer. A minimum of 20,000 nuclei were counted for each sample, and each experiment was replicated at least three times. Data analysis was conducted using FLOWJO software, and representative images were presented. The endoreduplication index (EI) was calculated using the formula: EI = [(0 × percentage of 2C nuclei) + (1 × percentage of 4C nuclei) + (2 × percentage of 8C muclei) + (3 × percentage of 16C nuclei) + (4 × percentage of 32C nuclei)]/100.

Yeast two-hybrid assays were conducted according to the protocols outlined in the Yeast Protocols Handbook (Clontech). The CDS of PsCIK2/3 was cloned into the bait plasmid pBT3-SUC, while the CDS of PsCLV1 or PsCLV2 was cloned into the prey plasmid pPR3-N. The primer sequences used for cloning are provided in Supplementary Table 47. These plasmids were co-transformed into the yeast strain NMY51 in different combinations. Transformants were initially screened on SD/-Trp/-Leu medium to confirm successful co-transformation. Interaction assays were then performed on SD/-Trp/-Leu/-His/-Ade medium containing the chromogenic substrate X-α-Gal at 30 °C to detect protein-protein interactions.

Confocal images were collected with Leica TCS SP8 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica). After sampling, the shoot apices of Caméor and fa mutant line JI0814, the young leaves (gp/gp, JI2366; Gp/Gp JI0817), and the pod walls of JI0074 and JI1995 were immediately preserved in formaldehyde/alcohol/acetic acid fixative. Paraffin sectioning was performed following established methodologies. Staining was conducted using safranin and fast green (JI0074 and JI1995) and toluidine blue (Caméor and JI0814). Prepared slides were scanned using a NanoZoomer, and cell quantification was carried out using NDP.view2 software. For pods, the resin block was sliced at 60–80 nm on an ultrathin slicer, and the slices were picked up on a 150-mesh copper mesh. The copper mesh was stained with a 2% uranyl acetate saturated alcohol solution in the dark for 8 min; washed 3 times with 70% alcohol; washed 3 times with ultrapure water; stained with a 2.6% lead citrate solution in the dark for 8 min; washed 3 times with ultrapure water, and slightly dried with filter paper. The copper mesh sections were placed in a copper mesh box and dried overnight at room temperature. The observation was under a transmission electron microscope and images collected for analysis.

For TEM studies, pea leaflets and pods (18 days after flowering) were removed from BC3 S2 gp/gp and Gp/Gp plants, after 9 h of daylight. Tissue (1 mm2) pieces were placed in a solution of 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.05 M sodium cacodylate, pH 7.3 for fixation. Samples were left overnight at room temperature and then processed for embedding (Leica EM TP embedding machine) by washing out the fixative with three successive 15-min washes in 0.05 M sodium cacodylate, followed by fixation in 1% (w/v) OsO4 in 0.05 M sodium cacodylate for 2 h at room temperature. After three 15 min washes in distilled water, samples were dehydrated in an ethanol series (30%, 50%, 70%, 95% and two changes of 100% ethanol), then infiltrated with LR White resin (London Resin Company) by successive changes of resin:ethanol mixes at room temperature (1:1 for 1 h, 2:1 for 1 h, 3:1 for 1 h, 100% resin for 1 h, then 100% resin for 16 h, and 100% resin for a further 8 h). Samples were polymerized in LR White resin at 60 °C for 16 h, then sectioned with a diamond knife (Leica UC7 ultramicrotome). Ultrathin sections (approximately 90 nm) were placed on 200 mesh formvar and carbon-coated copper grids (Agar Scientific). Sections were stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate for 1 h and 1% (w/v) lead citrate for 1 min, washed in distilled water and air dried. Grids were viewed in a FEI Talos 200 C transmission electron microscope (FEI) at 200 kV and imaged using a Gatan OneView 4K × 4K digital camera (Gatan) to record DM4 files.

Tissues were rinsed with PBS and immediately placed in the in situ hybridization fixative solution for more than 12 h. Paraffin section preparation and in situ hybridization of the probes were performed according to standard protocols80. The sequences of the digoxigenin (DIG)-labelled antisense riboprobes used for in situ hybridization are provided in Supplementary Table 47. The hybridization signal was detected with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (200-052-156, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Finally, images were obtained and analysed using a Pannoramic MIDI digital slide scanner (3DHISTECH).

We built a transcriptome atlas from the reference line Caméor (Supplementary Table 30), and selected various accessions that display the contrasting pairs of traits studied here (Supplementary Table 31). In China, plant tissues (seed, root, nodule, leaflet, stem, flower, pod, stipule, tendril and apical bud) at different development stages (seedling, flowering and podding) were collected and fixed in Trizol before RNA extraction. Tissues were ground in liquid nitrogen and the FastPure Universal Plant Total RNA Isolation Kit (Vazyme Biotech) was used to extract total RNA, the quality of which was assessed by gel electrophoresis. For each sample, we performed short-read RNA-sequencing using the DNBSEQ Platform at BGI Group to generate 6–8 Gb raw RNA reads for each accession.

At JIC, RNA was prepared from young developing pods (flat pod stage, ~60–70 mm in length) of each of the parental and RI lines derived from the cross between JI0015 (gp/gp) and JI0399 (Gp/Gp). Developing seeds were removed from the pods, which were then rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. High-quality RNA lacking genomic DNA was extracted from 97 individual pod samples, using a Spectrum Plant Total RNA Kit (Sigma-Aldrich), and used for PCR with reverse transcription and RNA-seq experiments focussed on the identification and characterisation of gene candidates for gp. For the latter analysis, green-podded and yellow-podded RILs (95 in total) were assigned to three groups for each phenotype, ensuring that lines with contrasting plant phenotypes (e.g. plant height) were randomly distributed among the replicate groups (G1, G2 and G3 for green-podded RILs; Y1, Y2 and Y3 for yellow-podded RILs, with 15–17 RILs per pool). Equal amounts of RNA from every line within a group were pooled. RNA-seq (Illumina HiSeq4000) and initial bioinformatic analyses were carried out by the Earlham Institute.

We performed Iso-seq sequencing for a subset of accessions for the target organ at specific developmental stages. We used the Iso-Seq (v.4.0.0) pipeline to process PacBio SMRT Cell subreads and generate high-quality, full-length transcripts. First, subreads from each SMRT Cell were processed with ccs (v.3.4.1) to produce one circular consensus sequence per zero-mode waveguide, applying a minimum read quality of 0.9. Next, primer removal and demultiplexing were performed with lima (v.2.9.0) in Iso-Seq mode, removing unwanted primer combinations and orienting reads from 5′ to 3′. Full-length reads were then refined by trimming poly(A) tails and removing concatemers. When multiple SMRT cells were sequenced, the resulting full-length non-concatemer (FLNC) BAM files were merged before clustering. Iso-Seq cluster (v.4.0.0) was applied to produce polished consensus transcripts, partitioned into high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) sets on the basis of predicted accuracy. The final consensus transcripts were aligned to the ZW6 and JI0074 reference genomes using pbmm2 (v.1.14.99). Last, iso-seq collapse was used to collapse redundant isoforms and generate GFF files, which were converted to GFF3 with gffread (0.12.7) for downstream analyses.

RT–qPCR was conducted to analyse gene expression. Total RNA was extracted using the FastPure Plant Total RNA Isolation Kit (Vazyme Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions, including an on-column DNase I digestion step to remove genomic DNA. Subsequently, 1 μg of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis with the All-in-One First-Strand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix for qPCR kit (TransGen Biotech). Green qPCR SuperMix kit (TransGen Biotech) was used for amplification on a CFX384TM Real-Time System (Bio-Rad). The method of collecting plant material for the detection of P/PsCLE41 and V/PsMYB26 was as follows: (1) pods were collected 10 days after flowering. After removing the seeds, the pods were cut into pieces and frozen in liquid nitrogen; (2) apical buds were collected 14 days after emergence and, after removing the extra young leaves under a microscope, the buds were cut into pieces and frozen in liquid nitrogen; (3) stems were collected 14 days after emergence at the third node from the top of the stem, cut into pieces and frozen in liquid nitrogen; (4) seed cotyledons were collected 12 days after flowering; after removing the testa, the cotyledons were cut into pieces and frozen in liquid nitrogen.

To validate the Gp transcriptional fusion and aberrant transcripts, the total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using HiScript III First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (+gDNA wiper, Vazyme Biotech). RT–qPCR analysis was conducted using Taq Pro Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme Biotech), employing specific primers, with PsACTIN serving as the internal standard. Expression levels of genes were quantified relative to the control based using the 2−ΔΔCT method. All RT–qPCR results represent the mean ± s.d. from three separate biological experiments. The primers used for RT–qPCR primers used are provided in Supplementary Table 47.

Bisulfite treatment and libraries were prepared accordingly to the standard protocol of methylation library construction. PE150 sequencing was performed using Illumina NovaSeq X Plus sequencing platform 25B chip. Quality control and adapter trimming of the raw whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data was then performed using Trimmomatic (v.0.39). The resulting WGBS reads were mapped to the JI0074 reference genome using Bismark (v.0.23.0) and PCR duplicates were removed from the aligned reads.

Statistical analyses were conducted in R software suite (v.4.2; https://www.r-project.org/) unless otherwise stated. The correlation between different traits was tested by calculating the coefficients of Pearson correlation, as well as the P values, using the cor.test package, with the method set to ‘Pearson' for the correlation analyses between quantitative traits. Traits collected at different locations and in different years were analysed by calculating their rank correlations by setting the option ‘method' to ‘Spearman'. The correlation between qualitative traits was assessed using the chi-square test using the ‘chisq.test' package in R. Gene expression levels in different lines or organs under different treatments or at different developmental stages (at least three biological replicates for each sample) were analysed using DESeq2 (ref. 81), in which the genes with a false discovery rate (Bonferroni) lower than 0.01 were defined as significantly regulated genes, unless there is an alternative explanation in a specific legend. The min–max scaling (normalization) approach was used to calculate the expression level for comparison of each gene across stages and organs by the formula: Xscaled = (X − Xmin)/(Xmax − Xmin).

PCA (main text Fig. 1) was performed on the PLINK distance matrix using an Excel add-in downloaded from RIKEN, now available at https://systemsomicslab.github.io/compms/others/main.html#Statistics.

All experiments were designed with explicit consideration of statistical power and reproducibility. Each experiment was independently repeated at least three times (biological replicates) with consistent results across repetitions, including microscopy analyses used at least three samples or technical replicates per experimental condition (such as Fig. 3b,c,g and Extended Data Figs. 4a–c,e and 6b,h,i); phenotypic observations were validated across ≥3 independent growth cycles (Norwich, Shenzhen, Harbin, multiple sites and multiple years). Micrographs shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. Complete protocols and raw data supporting the conclusions are available in the Data availability and Supplementary Information. Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m., and statistical significance was determined using two-tailed Students' t-tests (‘t.test' package in R software v.4.2) in the analyses of the phenotypes, such as seed weight and pod width, between different accessions.

The core high-quality SNP dataset was used for population structural analyses. PCA and t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding analyses were first performed using beta Python modules sklearn.decomposition and sklearn.manifold. ADMIXTURE82 (version 1.3.0) was employed to analyse the population structure, with K increasing from 2 to 16. The Q value represents the estimated proportion of an individual's genome that originates from each inferred ancestral population cluster.

Genetic differentiation (Fst) and nucleotide diversity (π) were calculated with VCFtools (version 0.1.13). Fst scores were calculated within nonoverlapping 100-kb windows and π was calculated for each individual site and averaged across the genome for each group. LD was calculated on SNP pairs within a 500-kb window using PopLDdecay83 (version 3.31; https://github.com/BGI-shenzhen/PopLDdecay) and the decay was measured by the distance at which the Pearson's correlation efficient (r2) dropped to half of the maximum. Splits tree analysis of the PLINK distance matrix was performed using SplitsTree4 (ref. 61).

All the germplasm described and used in this work is available to order from the John Innes Centre Germplasm Resources Unit (https://www.seedstor.ac.uk/). The 697 sequenced single seed descent lines derived from John Innes Pisum Germplasm accessions, were imported in 2019 to the Agricultural Genomics Institute at Shenzhen (AGIS), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), where they have been grown and phenotyped annually since then.

Metrics details

Understanding the human de novo mutation (DNM) rate requires complete sequence information1. Here using five complementary short-read and long-read sequencing technologies, we phased and assembled more than 95% of each diploid human genome in a four-generation, twenty-eight-member family (CEPH 1463). We estimate 98–206 DNMs per transmission, including 74.5 de novo single-nucleotide variants, 7.4 non-tandem repeat indels, 65.3 de novo indels or structural variants originating from tandem repeats, and 4.4 centromeric DNMs. Among male individuals, we find 12.4 de novo Y chromosome events per generation. Short tandem repeats and variable-number tandem repeats are the most mutable, with 32 loci exhibiting recurrent mutation through the generations. We accurately assemble 288 centromeres and six Y chromosomes across the generations and demonstrate that the DNM rate varies by an order of magnitude depending on repeat content, length and sequence identity. We show a strong paternal bias (75–81%) for all forms of germline DNM, yet we estimate that 16% of de novo single-nucleotide variants are postzygotic in origin with no paternal bias, including early germline mosaic mutations. We place all this variation in the context of a high-resolution recombination map (~3.4 kb breakpoint resolution) and find no correlation between meiotic crossover and de novo structural variants. These near-telomere-to-telomere familial genomes provide a truth set to understand the most fundamental processes underlying human genetic variation.

The telomere-to-telomere (T2T) assembly of a human genome1 added an estimated 8% of the most repeat-rich DNA, including regions typically excluded from studies of human genetic variation, such as centromeres2, segmental duplications (SDs)3 and acrocentric regions1,4. Long-read sequencing (LRS) of many phased human diploid genomes has already begun to offer insights into mutational mechanisms5,6,7, opening up the discovery of all forms of variation irrespective of class or complexity8,9. Direct comparison of parental genomes to their offspring increases the power to identify DNMs as opposed to mapping reads to an intermediate reference, such as GRCh38 or T2T-CHM13 (ref. 10).

The goal of this study was to construct a high-quality human pedigree resource whereby chromosomes were fully assembled and phased, and their transmission was studied intergenerationally to enhance our understanding of both recombination and DNM processes. We sought to eliminate three ascertainment biases with respect to discovery, including biases to specific genomic regions, classes of genetic variation and reference genome effects. To achieve this, we focused on the four-generation, 28-member family CEPH 1463. This family has been intensively studied over the past three decades11, and we sequenced the family members using five sequencing technologies with distinct and complementary error modalities. This particular pedigree has served as a benchmark for early linkage mapping studies11,12 using short-read sequencing (SRS)13 and continues to serve as reference for understanding human variation, including patterns of mosaicism14,15.

Just as the initial T2T genome1 served as a reference for understanding all regions of the genome, our objective was to create a reference truth set for both inherited and de novo variation.

We generated PacBio high-fidelity (HiFi), ultra-long Oxford Nanopore Technologies (UL-ONT), Strand-seq, Illumina and Element AVITI Biosciences (Element) whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data for most of the 28 members from a four-generation family (CEPH 1463 pedigree) (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1).

Twenty-eight members of the four-generation pedigree CEPH 1463 were sequenced using five orthogonal next-generation and LRS platforms: HiFi sequencing, Illumina and Element sequencing were performed on peripheral blood for G2–G4, and UL-ONT and Strand-seq data were generated on available lymphoblastoid cell lines for G1–G3. The pedigree dataset has been expanded to include the fourth generation and G3 spouses (200080 and 200100).

For the purpose of variant discovery, we focused on generating long-read PacBio, short-read Illumina and Element data from blood-derived DNA to avoid cell-line-specific artefacts. We also used the corresponding cell lines to generate UL-ONT reads to construct near-T2T assemblies as well as Strand-seq data to detect large polymorphic inversions and evaluate assembly accuracy (Methods and Supplementary Table 2). In brief, we generated deep WGS data from multiple orthogonal sequencing platforms, focusing primarily on the first three generations (G1–G3) (Extended Data Fig. 1a), and used the fourth generation (G4) to validate de novo germline variants. We applied two hybrid genome assembly pipelines, Verkko16 and hifiasm17, to generate highly contiguous, phased genome assemblies for G1–G3, while G4 members were assembled using HiFi data only (Methods).

In summary, Verkko assemblies are the most contiguous (AuN (similar to average contig length measure): 102 Mb) (Extended Data Fig. 1b, Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 and Supplementary Note 8) and we estimate that 63.3% (319 out of 504) of chromosomes across G1–G3 are near-T2T (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Moreover, 42.3% (213 out of 504) of non-acrocentric chromosomes are spanned in a single contig with canonical telomere repeats at each end (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 3). We sequenced and assembled 288 centromeres (44.7%, 288 out of 644) across G1–G3 and note that different assemblers preferentially assembled different human centromeres (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 4). Both the sequence (QV range, 47–58) and phasing accuracy are high (Methods, Supplementary Figs. 5–12 and Supplementary Table 4).

This data resource enables us to track the inheritance of any genomic segment and associated variants across all four generations (Extended Data Fig. 2a). We identified a total of 5.95 million single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels and 35,662 structural variants (SVs)—all of which are Mendelian consistent across the second and third generations (Methods, Supplementary Table 5, Supplementary Fig. 13 and Data availability)18. Of the 5.95 million, 77% of small variants are supported by all three technologies, with variant calling from primary material helping to eliminate DNMs arising from cell line artefacts (Supplementary Note 1). LRS provides access to an additional approximately 260 Mb of the human genome (2.77 Gb) in contrast to the Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) (2.51 Gb)19 or Illumina WGS (2.58 Gb)13 data, including 201 Mb not present in either study. Some of the largest gains occur among SDs and their associated genes. We classified 85.5% (6,883 out of 8,048 merged SDs) of the SDs (coverage, >95%) as high confidence in comparison to 25.6% (2,060 out of 8,048 merged SDs) in the previous GIAB analysis, a major improvement for these highly copy-number variable regions20. We find that the majority (>91%) of known copy-number variable regions were stably transmitted in this pedigree, while the remaining 9% were often flagged as potentially misassembled (Supplementary Note 2). Similarly, we provide a comprehensive census of mobile element insertions (Methods, Supplementary Table 6, Supplementary Fig. 14 and Supplementary Note 3) and identify 120 inversions segregating in a Mendelian manner (21 were ambiguous) (Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Figs. 15–18). The latter includes a rare inversion (~703 kb) overlapping a disease-associated copy-number variable region at chromosome 15q25.2 (ref. 21) (Supplementary Fig. 19) and an inverted duplication (~295 kb) at chromosome 16q11.2 (Supplementary Fig. 20).

Using three different approaches13,22 (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 2b), we identify 539 meiotic breakpoints in G3 (n = 8) with respect to T2T-CHM13, with 99.8% (538 out of 539) supported by more than one approach (Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Fig. 21). From an initial resolution of around 3.4 kb, we further refined 90.4% (487 out of 539) of the breakpoints to a median size of about 2.5 kb based on direct genome comparisons between parent and a child (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 22). Notably, 191 breakpoints actually increase in size as a result of reference biases in T2T-CHM13 (Supplementary Fig. 23). We distinguish recombination breakpoints with very sharp transition between parental haplotypes from those with an extended region of homology at both parental haplotypes (Extended Data Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 24). We also characterize 78 smaller haplotype segment ‘switches' in G3 (median size of ~1 kb)23,24,25 that would be consistent with either a double crossover or an allelic gene conversion event, although this is probably an underestimate due to our strict filtering criteria (Methods, Supplementary Table 9 and Supplementary Fig. 25). Extending recombination mapping to G4 chromosomes, we add 964 breakpoints for a total of 1,503 meiotic breakpoints across 22 transmissions (Supplementary Fig. 26). This includes 16 recombination hotspots, 11 of which are consistent with previously reported increased recombination rates26 (Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Fig. 27).

Overall, 15–20% of paternal and maternal homologues are transmitted without a detectable meiotic breakpoint (that is, non-recombinant chromosomes) (Supplementary Fig. 28). We observe a significant excess (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P = 6.4 × 10−5) of maternal recombination events with expected maternal to paternal breakpoint ratio of 1.4 (ref. 27) (Supplementary Fig. 29). Paternal recombination is significantly biased towards the ends of human chromosomes with 55 paternal recombination events mapping to within 2 Mb of the telomere in comparison to 1 event in female individuals27,28,29 (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 30). In G2–G3, we observed a decrease in crossover events with advancing parental age for both male and female germlines (Extended Data Fig. 2d). We modelled this observation across G1–G4 using a Poisson generalized linear model (GLM) with a log link and continued to observe a significant decrease in recombination breakpoints as a function of parental age and sex (P = 7.17 × 10−3 and 1.22 × 10−9 for parental age and sex, respectively; Poisson GLM with a log link, AIC = 284.2) (Supplementary Fig. 31). Although there is no known biological mechanism that would lead to a decrease in both parental germlines, this observation runs counter to a population-level analysis based on SRS data25,30,31. We consider this observation to be preliminary until a larger number of families is analysed.

To discover small variants, we examined HiFi reads aligned to T2T-CHM13, then used orthogonal ONT and Illumina data to confirm that a variant is in fact present in a sample and absent from parents (Methods). This strategy reduces platform bias but restricts DNM discovery to G2 (n = 2) and G3 (n = 8) individuals, as ONT data were not generated for G4. Our de novo callset included 755 SNVs and 73 indels across the autosomes (Fig. 2a), and 27 SNVs and 1 indel on the X chromosome. We used flanking SNVs to construct haplotypes, phase variants and trace a mutation back either to a parental gamete or the early embryo. We determined that a mutation occurred somatically, and probably early in embryonic development, if it met one of two criteria: it was incompletely linked to a parental haplotype (n = 122) or, if it could not be phased, it had an allele balance significantly less than 0.5 across all three sequencing platforms (n = 7) (Fig. 2b), which was further confirmed using Element data (Supplementary Fig. 32). Moreover, we validated each postzygotic mutation (PZM) by tracing its haplotype backwards across generations and forwards for the four individuals with sequenced offspring (Supplementary Note 4).

a, The number of de novo germline mutations, PZMs and indels (<50 bp) for the parents (G2) and eight children in CEPH 1463. TR DNMs (<50 bp) are shown for G3 only because they have greater parental sequencing depth and we can assess transmission (Methods). The hatched bars show the number of SNVs confirmed as transmitting to the next generation. b, Germline SNVs (n = 626) have a mean allele balance of near 0.50 across the sequencing platforms, while the mean postzygotic SNV (n = 119) allele balance is less than 0.25. The box plots show the median (centre line), the interquartile range (IQR) (box limits) and the whiskers extend to 25% − 1.5 × IQR and 75% + 1.5 × IQR; outliers are shown as dots. c, A strong paternal age effect is observed for germline de novo SNVs (+1.55 DNMs per year; two-sided t-test, P = 0.013) but not for PZMs (P = 0.72). We observe no significant maternal age effect for DNMs (+0.20 DNMs per year, P = 0.54) or PZMs (P = 0.74). The solid lines are regression lines that were fitted using a linear model function; the surrounding shaded areas represent their 95% confidence intervals. d, The estimated SNV DNM rate by region of the genome shows a significant excess of DNM for large repeat regions, including centromeres and SDs. Assembly-based DNM calls on the centromeres and Y chromosome (chr.) show an excess of DNM in the satellite DNA. A significant difference from the autosomal DNM or PZM rate was determined using two-sided t-tests; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.001. P values for each comparison are as follows: 0.0066 (alignment-based DNMs in SDs), 0.049 (alignment-based PZMs in SDs), 0.017 (alignment-based DNMs in centromeres), 0.34 (alignment-based PZMs in centromeres), 0.13 (assembly-based DNMs in centromeric flanking regions), 0.14 (assembly-based DNMs in centromeric HORs), 0.59 (assembly-based DNMs in chromosome Y euchromatic regions) and 0.00025 (assembly-based DNMs in Yq12).

Of the 62 PZMs in these four samples, 64.5% (n = 40) are transmitted to the next generation, compared with 97.2% of germline SNVs (242 out of 249) and 100% of indels (Extended Data Fig. 3). We found that 10 PZMs failed these haplotype-based validations, resulting in a final callset of 119 PZMs, accounting for 16% of total autosomal SNVs (745 de novo SNVs). Previous Illumina-based analysis of this family14 identified 605 de novo SNVs of either germline (G2 and G3) or postzygotic (only G2) origin, 92.4% (n = 559) of which were represented in our final callset, while all but four of the absent variants failed validation with long-read data. We were able to identify an additional 72 PZMs in G3 for the first time, including a total of 186 novel DNMs, a 6.1% and 21% increase in germline SNV and indel discovery, respectively.

In total, 81.4% of germline small DNMs originate on paternal haplotypes (4.38:1 paternal:maternal ratio, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P < 2 × 10−16), with a significant parental age effect of 1.55 germline DNMs per additional year of paternal age when fitting with linear regression (two-sided t-test, P = 0.013). By contrast, PZMs show no significant difference with respect to parental origin (1.38:1 paternal:maternal ratio, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P = 0.09) and no parental age effects (Fig. 2c). Although our small sample size does not provide sufficient power to detect significant differences between the de novo and postzygotic mutational spectra (Supplementary Fig. 33a), we do observe a novel depletion of CpG>TpG PZMs (χ2 test, P = 0.17) and an enrichment of postzygotic T>A substitutions (χ2 test, P = 0.268) that has been previously observed14.

We successfully assayed 91.9% of the autosomal genome (2.66 Gb) (Supplementary Fig. 33b and Supplementary Note 4). Excluding all variants classified as postzygotic, we find that the parental germline contributes 1.17 × 10−8 SNVs per bp per generation (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08 × 10−8–1.27 × 10−8). De novo SNVs are significantly enriched in repetitive sequences, as much as 2.8-fold in centromeres (95% CI = 1.79 × 10−8–5.51 × 10−8 SNVs per bp per generation, two-sided t-test, P = 0.017) and 1.9-fold in SDs (95% CI = 1.64 × 10−8–2.88 × 10−8 SNVs per bp per generation, two-sided t-test, P = 0.0066) (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 33c and Supplementary Table 10). We observed a lower PZM rate of 2.04 × 10−9 SNVs per bp per generation (95% CI = 1.68 × 10−9–2.47 × 10−9) across the autosomes, yet we see a 3.9-fold enrichment of PZMs in SDs (95% CI = 4.84 × 10−9–1.25 × 10−8 SNVs per bp per generation, two-sided t-test, P = 0.049). Among PZMs transmitted to the next generation (n = 33 PZMs across four samples), we observe a 2.69-fold enrichment in SDs (95% CI = 1.15 × 10−9–1.08 × 10−8 SNVs per bp per generation) that does not reach significance owing to the small sample size (two-sided t-test, P = 0.218).

Here we investigate tandem repeats (TRs), including short TRs (STRs, 1–6 bp motifs) and variable-number TRs (VNTRs, 7–1,000 bp motifs). We successfully genotyped 7.68 million out of 7.82 million TR loci (Methods) on HiFi data using the Tandem Repeat Genotyping Tool (TRGT)32, across all members of the pedigree. Of those, 7.17 million (93.4%) loci were completely Mendelian concordant across all trios. We used TRGT-denovo to identify candidate DNMs at loci that were covered by at least 10 HiFi reads across all members of a given trio; on average, 6.88 million TR loci met this criterion33. We refined these putative DNMs through orthogonal sequencing and transmission (Methods). Element sequencing, generated from blood DNA, exhibits substantially lower error rates following homopolymer tracts34, so we tested whether it could more accurately measure the length of homopolymers and other TR alleles. We observed low stutter in the Element data at homopolymers; across a random sample of 1,000 homozygous homopolymer loci called by TRGT, an average of 99.5% of Element reads perfectly support the TRGT-genotyped allele size in GRCh38, compared to 93.5% of Illumina sequencing reads (Supplementary Figs. 34 and 35).

We used the Element data to further validate de novo TR alleles called by TRGT-denovo. Owing to the short read length of Element data, we could assess only 80 out of 613 (13.1%) de novo STR alleles (average of 10 STRs per sample). We considered a DNM validated if Element reads supported the TRGT allele size in the child and did not support it in either parent (allowing for off-by-one base-pair errors; Methods). Of the 80 de novo STRs that we could assess, 56 (70%) passed our strict consistency criteria. The validation rate was lower at homopolymers (3 out of 20; 15%) than at non-homopolymers (53 out of 60; 88.3%), indicating that our estimates of mutation rates at homopolymers may be less precise. Using pedigree information, we required that candidate de novo TR alleles observed in the two G3 individuals with sequenced children (NA12879 and NA12886) be transmitted to at least one child in the subsequent generation (G4). Of the 128 de novo TR alleles observed in the two G3 individuals, 96 (75%) were transmitted to the next generation, which is significantly lower than de novo SNVs reflecting the challenges that still remain in accurately characterizing de novo TRs.

After Element and transmission validation, we found an average of 65.3 TR DNMs (including STRs, VNTRs and complex loci) per sample and estimated a TR DNM rate of 4.74 × 10−6 per locus per haplotype per generation (95% CI = 4.06 × 10−6–5.43 × 10−6), with substantial variation across repeat motif sizes (Fig. 3a). Collectively, TR DNMs inserted or deleted a mean of 978 bp per sample or 15.0 bp per event (Supplementary Table 10). An average of 54.9 mutations were expansions or contractions of STR motifs, 2.6 affected VNTR motifs and 7.8 affected ‘complex' loci comprising both STR and VNTR motifs. The STR mutation rate was 5.50 × 10−6 DNMs per locus per haplotype per generation (95% CI = 5.0 × 10−6–6.04 × 10−6). The VNTR mutation rate was 0.83 × 10−6 (95% CI = 0.51 × 10−6–1.27 × 10−6), predominantly comprising loci that could not be assessed in SRS studies. Several previous estimates of the genome-wide STR mutation rate considered only polymorphic STR loci; when we limited our analysis to STR loci that were polymorphic in the CEPH 1463 pedigree, we found 5.98 × 10−5 de novo STR events per locus per generation (95% CI = 5.43–6.57 × 10−5), which is broadly consistent with previous estimates of 4.95 × 10−5–5.6 × 10−5 (refs. 35,36,37). Overall, 75.0% of phased de novo TR alleles were paternal in origin (Fig. 3b). The mutation rate for dinucleotide motifs was higher than for homopolymers, and we observed an increasing mutation rate with motif size for motifs greater than 6 bp in length (Fig. 3a). As reported in previous studies35, larger TR loci (defined as the total length of the TR locus in the reference genome sequence) exhibited higher mutation rates (Supplementary Fig. 36a). We did not observe a significant bias towards expansions or contractions (two-sided binomial test, P = 0.19) (Supplementary Fig. 36b).

a, TR DNM rates (mutations per haplotype per locus per generation) are displayed for each TR class (STR, VNTR or complex) as a function of the minimum motif size observed at each TR locus (n = 522) in the T2T-CHM13 reference genome (blue; left y axis).The average number of loci of each motif size that passed filtering criteria in each individual are displayed in grey (right y axis). The error bars denote the 95% Poisson CIs (computed using a χ2 distribution) around the mean mutation rate estimate. The mutation rates include all non-recurrent calls that pass TRGT-denovo filtering criteria and Element consistency analysis. b, The inferred parent-of-origin for confidently phased TR DNMs in G3. The hatching indicates transmission to at least one G4 child, where available. c, Pedigree overview of a recurrent VNTR locus at chromosome 8: 2376919–2377075 (T2T-CHM13) with motif composition GAGGCGCCAGGAGAGAGCGCT(n)ACGGG(n). Allele colouring indicates inheritance patterns as determined by inheritance vectors, with grey representing unavailable data. The symbols denote inheritance type relative to the inherited parental allele: plus (+) for de novo expansion and minus (−) for de novo contraction, shown only for the mutating alleles; the numbers indicate allele lengths in bp. De novo TR alleles are present in seven out of eight G3 individuals and transmit to four G4 individuals, with two expanding further after transmission. The spouse of a G3 individual (200080) carries a distinct TR allele that undergoes a de novo contraction in subsequent transmissions. d, Read-level evidence for the recurrent DNM in c, represented as vertical lines, obtained from individual sequencing reads, shown per sample. Where available, both HiFi (top) and ONT (bottom) sequencing reads are displayed. Colouring is consistent with the inheritance patterns in c; the outlined boxes with plus or minus markers highlight DNMs.

We identified a subset of TR loci that were recurrently mutated among members of the pedigree. We identified a high-confidence set of 32 loci (Methods and Supplementary Table 11): five showing intragenerational recurrence (observed DNMs in at least two G3 individuals) and 27 loci with intergenerational recurrence (observed DNMs in at least two generations). As they are observed only in a single generation, the five intragenerational DNMs may represent mosaicism in the parental germline, rather than recurrent mutational events. Notably, we observed three or more distinct de novo expansions or contractions at 16 of the loci that exhibited recurrence (Extended Data Table 1). As an example, we highlight an intergenerational recurrently mutated TR locus with ten unique de novo expansions and/or contractions (Fig. 3c,d). All allele transmissions are fully consistent with the inheritance vectors (Supplementary Note 5) and are supported by both HiFi and ONT reads.

Among the 288 completely assembled centromeres, we assessed 150 intergenerational transmissions (Fig. 4a). Comparing these assembled centromeres between parent and child, we identify 18 (12%) de novo SVs validated by both ONT and HiFi data with roughly equivalent numbers of insertions and deletions (Fig. 4b and Methods). All de novo SVs (n = 8) that had a child sequenced as part of this study confirmed transmission to the next generation (Supplementary Table 10). We find that 72.2% (13 out of 18) of SVs map to α-satellite higher-order repeat (HOR) arrays (Extended Data Fig. 4a) with the remainder (5 out of 18, 27.8%) corresponding to various pericentromeric flanking sequences but not flanking monomeric α-satellites. All α-satellite HOR de novo SV events involve integer changes in the basic α-satellite HOR cassettes specific to each centromere and range in size from 680 bp (one 4-mer α-satellite HOR on chromosome 9) to 12,228 bp (four 18-mer α-satellite HORs on chromosome 6) (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 4b). One transmission from chromosome 9 involves both a gain of 2,052 bp (six dimer α-satellite HOR units) and a loss of 1,710 bp (one 4-mer α-satellite HOR and three α-satellite dimer units) in a single G2-to-G3 transmission (Fig. 4d–f). The chromosome 6 centromere has the most recurrent structural events, with three being observed across three generations (Fig. 4a). The chromosome 6 centromere has the greatest number of nearly perfectly identical (>99.9%) α-satellite HORs (Extended Data Fig. 4c).

The coloured arrows at the top of each haplotype show the α-satellite HOR structure. g, Example of two de novo deletions in the chromosome 21 centromere of G2-NA12877. The deletions reside within a hypomethylated region of the centromeric α-satellite HOR array, known as the CDR, which is thought to be the site of kinetochore assembly. The deletion of three α-satellite HORs within the CDR results in a shift of the CDR by around 260 kb in G2-NA12877.

We also assessed 18 SV events for their potential effect on the hypomethylation pocket associated with the centromere dip region (CDR)—a marker of the site of kinetochore attachment38,39 (Methods). We find that 11 SVs mapping outside of the CDR have a marginal effect on changing the centre point of the CDR (<100 kb) from one generation to another (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e), while SVs mapping within the CDR have a more marked effect (average shift of around 260 kb) and/or they completely alter the distribution of the CDR (Fig. 4g and Extended Data Fig. 4f,g). Although follow-up experiments using CENP-A chromatin immunoprecipitation–sequencing are needed to confirm the actual binding site of the kinetochore, these findings suggest that structural mutations may have epigenetic consequences in changing the position of kinetochore.

Finally, using 31 parent–child transmissions of centromeres (150.5 Mb), we identify 16 SNV DNMs in centromeres, including five within the α-satellite HOR arrays, for a DNM rate of 1.01 × 10−7 mutations per bp per generation (95% CI = 5.75 × 10−8–1.63 × 10−7). This rate is comparable to the rate from our read-based mapping approach, which identified 14 centromeric SNVs, albeit over more than 10 times the amount of sequence, resulting in a DNM rate of 3.27 × 10−8 mutations per bp per generation (95% CI = 1.79 × 10−8–5.51 × 10−8) (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 10). By combining the data, we estimate a significantly higher SNV DNM rate for centromeres of 4.94 × 10−8 (two-sided t-test, P = 0.017). We believe that this is a conservative estimate because we required validation of all events by both the ONT and HiFi sequencing platforms.

There are nine male members who carry the R1b1a-Z302 Y haplogroup across the four generations (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 12) and we use the great-grandfather (G1-NA12889; Fig. 1) Y-chromosome assembly as a reference for DNM detection across 48.8 Mb of the male-specific Y-chromosomal region (MSY) (Methods and Supplementary Note 6). The de novo assembly-based approach increases by more than twofold the number of accessible base pairs when compared to HiFi read-based calling but increases by more than sevenfold the discovery of de novo SNVs. In total, we identify 48 de novo SNVs in the MSY across the 5 G2–G3 male individuals, ranging from 7 to 11 SNVs per Y transmission (mean, 9.6; median, 10) (Supplementary Table 13). Only 2 SNVs map to the Y euchromatic regions, 1 to the pericentromeric regions and the remaining 45 out of 48 map to the Yq12 heterochromatic satellite regions (Fig. 5b). In total, we estimate a de novo SNV rate of 1.99 × 10−7 mutations per bp per generation (95% CI = 1.59 × 10−7–2.39 × 10−7) for the entire MSY. This estimate is an order of magnitude higher than that previously reported for Y euchromatic regions40 due to access to Yq12 satellite DNA (Supplementary Table 13). We note that 13 out of 45 (29%) of the DNMs had 100% identical matches elsewhere in the Yq12 region (but not at orthologous positions) and probably result from interlocus gene conversion events within the DYZ1/DYZ2 repeats41 (Methods). We also identify a total of nine de novo indels (<50 bp, homopolymers excluded) ranging from 1–3 indels per sample (mean, 1.8 events per Y transmission) and five de novo SVs (≥50 bp) (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 13). The latter range from 2,416 to 4,839 bp in size, each affecting an entire DYZ2 repeat unit(s), with an average of one SV per Y transmission. All applicable DNMs (SNVs, n = 20 out of 48; indels, n = 6 out of 9; SVs, n = 4 out of 5) are concordant with the expected transmission through generations (that is, from G2 to G3–G4 and from G3-NA12866 to his three male descendants in G4) (Fig. 5b). Overall, 82% (51 out of 62) of the DNMs identified on chromosome Y (42 out of 48 SNVs; 4 out of 9 of indels; and 5 out of 5 SVs) are located in regions where short reads cannot be reliably mapped (mapping quality = 0).

Below the Y structure, all of the identified DNMs across G1–G3 Y assemblies are shown. Bottom, breakout by mutation class and by sample.

In total, we validated 41 de novo SVs across eight individuals (G3), including 16 insertions and 25 deletions (Methods) of which 68% (28 out of 41) originate in the paternal germline with a trend towards an increase in SVs with paternal age (Supplementary Fig. 37). Almost all SVs (40 out of 41) correspond to TRs, including mutation in centromeres, Y chromosome satellites and clustered SDs (Supplementary Table 10). We estimate around 5 SVs (95% CI = 3–7) per transmission affecting approximately 4.4 kb of DNA (median, 4,875 bp). If we exclude de novo SVs mapping to the centromere and Y chromosomes (n = 14), the median size of the events drops by an order of magnitude (median, 362 bp). Non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) has frequently been invoked as a mechanism to underlie TR expansions and contractions42,43. However, we find that none of the 27 euchromatic de novo SVs coincide with recombination crossovers (Supplementary Fig. 37e). This argues against NAHR between homologous chromosomes during meiosis I as the primary mechanism for their origin, although we cannot preclude other mechanisms associated with double-stranded breaks not involving recombination. We identify one retrotransposition event: a full-length (3,407 bp long) de novo insertion of an SVA element (SVAF subfamily) (G3-NA12887)44 with the predicted donor mapping around 23 Mb upstream (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 38). This insertion is present at a low frequency (around 11% of reads) in the parent (G2-NA12878) but not in the grandparental transmitting haplotype, consistent with a germline mosaic event arising in G2 postzygotically (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 39).

Most DNM studies40,45,46,47,48,49 are based on SRS data from large groups of trios and converge on around 60–70 DNMs per generation; however, these studies often exclude highly mutable regions of the genome7. Our multiplatform and multigenerational, assembly-based approach provides access to some of the most repetitive regions, such as centromeres and heterochromatic regions on the Y chromosome. The use of parental references in addition to the standard references and the ability to confirm transmissions across subsequent generations improves both sensitivity and specificity. In this multigenerational pedigree, we estimate a range of 98–206 DNMs per transmission (average of 152 per generation) and observe a strong paternal de novo bias (70–80%) and an increase with advancing paternal age, not only for SNVs but also for indels and SVs, including TRs.

The rate of de novo SNVs varies by more than an order of magnitude depending on the genomic context, consistent with recent human population-based analyses7,50 and theoretical predictions51. SD regions show an 88% increase (2.2 × 10−8 (95% CI = 1.64 × 10−8–2.88 × 10−8) versus 1.17 × 10−8). This is driven by SDs with >95% identity. We also observe a significant decrease in the de novo transition/transversion ratio compared with the genome (χ2 test, P = 0.0109) as predicted7 (Supplementary Note 7). We estimate that satellite DNA in the Yq12 heterochromatic region41,52 is at least 30 times more mutable than autosomal euchromatin (3.86 × 10−7 mutations per bp per generation). It is composed of thousands of short satellite DNA repeats (DYZ1/Hsat3A6 and DYZ2/Hsat1B) organized into Mb blocks that are >98% identical41,52. This, along with the fact that 29% of mutational changes match to non-orthologous sites in Yq12, is consistent with ‘interlocus gene conversion' driving this >20-fold excess, potentially as a result of increased sister chromatid exchange events41.

Previous studies predicted that 6–10% of DNMs are not germline in origin, but instead arise sometime after fertilization, giving rise to a mosaic variant14,53. This distinction has been based on allele balance thresholds53 or incomplete linkage to nearby SNVs across three generations14. LRS increases sensitivity by assigning nearly every de novo SNV to a parental haplotype and define PZM by its incomplete linkage to that haplotype. We classify 16% of de novo SNVs as postzygotic in origin (n = 119 PZMs/745 de novo SNVs). As all sequencing data in this study are derived from blood, we cannot demonstrate that every PZM is present in multiple tissues, but we can use transmission to the next generation as a proxy, as it reveals that the mutation is also present in germ cells. PZMs account for 12% of all SNVs transmitted to the next generation (n = 33 PZMs/275 transmitted SNVs), an increase over previous estimates. Early cell divisions of human embryos are frequently error prone54,55 with an accelerated rate of cell division potentially contributing to the large fraction of PZMs with high (>25%) allele balance. Such events would previously have been classified as germline but, consistent with PZM expectations, we find no paternal bias associated with these DNMs (Fig. 2c).

TRs are among the most mutable loci of our genome36,56,57, with the number of such de novo events comparable to germline SNVs58 but affecting more than an order of magnitude more base pairs per generation. We find a threefold differential in TR DNM rate with increasing repeat number and motif length generally correlating with mutation rate. However, we observe an apparent mutation rate trough between dinucleotides and larger motif lengths (>10 bp) (Fig. 3b), which may reflect different mutational mechanisms based on locus size, motif length and complexity. For example, larger TR motifs may be more likely to mutate through NAHR, synthesis-dependent strand annealing or interlocus gene conversion while mutational events at STRs may be biased toward traditional replication-based slippage mutational mechanisms42,43. Consistent with some earlier genome-wide analyses of minisatellites59, we did not find evidence that TR changes are mediated by unequal crossover between homologues during meiosis as none of our TR de novo SVs (n = 27) coincided with recombination breakpoints. Of particular interest in this regard is the discovery of 32 recurrently mutated TRs—loci rarely discovered out of the context of unstable disease alleles60. At five of these recurrent loci, we discovered multiple DNMs within a single generation (G3); these DNMs may be the outcome of germline mosaicism in a G2 parent or the activity of hypermutable TRs. Nearly all of these highly recurrent de novo events produced TR alleles that are significantly longer than the average short-read length and were detectable only using LRS. This includes changes in the length of around 7% of human centromeres in which insertions and deletions all occur as multiples of the predominant HOR unit56. The rate of de novo SVs increased from previous estimates of 0.2–0.3 per generation15,61 to 3–4 de novo SVs per generation reported in this study.

There are several limitations to this study. First, homopolymers still remain challenging even with the use of Element data as longer alleles and motifs embedded in larger repeats are still not reliably assayed with short reads. Second, we were unable to characterize DNMs in the acrocentric regions due to the repetitive nature of the regions and rampant ectopic recombination4. Third, we limited DNM discovery to the first three generations of only one multigenerational family and used G4 for validation purposes of transmitted variants. We acknowledge that familial variation depends on the genetic background14,36,62 and, therefore, many more families will be required to establish a reliable estimate of the mutation rate, especially for complex regions of the genome. In that regard, it is perhaps noteworthy that efforts are underway to characterize additional pedigrees. Notwithstanding, this study highlights that a single sequencing technology and a single human genome reference are insufficient to comprehensively estimate mutation rates. Multigenerational resources such as these will further refine DNM estimates and serve as another useful benchmark63 for new algorithms and new sequencing technologies.

Informed consent was obtained from the CEPH/Utah individuals, and the University of Utah Institutional Review Board approved the study (University of Utah IRB reference IRB_00065564). This includes informed consent for publication of research data for 23 family members; the remaining 5 provided informed consent for biobanking with controlled access (Data availability).

Cell lines for 14 members of the CEPH 1463 family (G1-GM12889, G1-GM12890, G1-GM12891, G1-GM12892, G2-GM12877, G2-GM12878, G3-GM12879, G3-GM12881, G3-GM12882, G3-GM12883, G3-GM12884, G3-GM12885, G3-GM12886 and G3-GM12887) were obtained from Coriell Institute for Medical Research (CEPH collection). Cell lines for G3 spouses and G4 family members (n = 13) were generated in-house as EBV transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines and include: G3-200080-spouse, G4-200081, G4-200082, G4-200084, G4-200085, G4-200086, G4-200087, G3-200100-spouse, G4-200101, G4-200102, G4-200103, G4-200104 and G4-200106.

All cell lines were authenticated by WGS of the DNA and subsequent variant calling to match the expected sex of the individual and sequencing results from blood-derived DNA from the same individual. Furthermore, we explored whether the obtained sequencing data match the expected inheritance patterns of parents and offspring. To our knowledge, none of the cell lines mentioned above were tested for mycoplasma contamination.

Family members from G2 and G3 were re-engaged for the purpose of updating informed consent and health history, and for enrolling their children (G4) and the marry-in parent (G3). Archived DNA from G2 and G3 was extracted from whole blood. Newly enrolled family members underwent informed consent, and blood was obtained for DNA and cell lines. DNA was extracted from whole blood using the Flexigene system (Qiagen 51206). All samples are broadly consented for scientific purposes, which makes this dataset ideal for future tool development and benchmarking studies.

Sequencing data from orthogonal short- and long-read platforms were generated as follows:

Illumina WGS data for G1–G3 were generated as previously described14. Illumina WGS data for G4 and marry-in spouses for G3 were generated by the Northwest Genomics Center using the PCR-free TruSeq library prep kit and sequenced to approximately 30× on the NovaSeq 6000 with paired-end 150 bp reads.

PacBio HiFi data were generated according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In brief, DNA was extracted from blood samples as described or cultured lymphoblasts using the Monarch HMW DNA Extraction Kit for Cells & Blood (New England Biolabs, T3050L). At all steps, quantification was performed with Qubit dsDNA HS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Q32854) measured on DS-11 FX (Denovix) and the size distribution checked using FEMTO Pulse (Agilent, M5330AA and FP-1002-0275.) HMW DNA was sheared with the Megaruptor 3 (Diagenode, B06010003 & E07010003) system using the settings 28/30, 28/31 or 27/29 based on the initial quality check to target a peak size of ~22 kb. After shearing, the DNA was used to generate PacBio HiFi libraries using the SMRTbell prep kit 3.0 (PacBio, 102-182-700). Size selection was performed either with diluted AMPure PB beads according to the protocol, or with Pippin HT using a high-pass cut-off between 10–17 kb based on shear size (Sage Science, HTP0001 and HPE7510). Libraries were sequenced either on the Sequel II platform on SMRT Cells 8M (PacBio, 101-389-001) using Sequel II sequencing chemistry 3.2 (PacBio,102-333-300) with 2 h pre-extension and 30 h movies on SMRT Link v.11.0 or 11.1, or on the Revio platform on Revio SMRT Cells (PacBio, 102-202-200) and Revio polymerase kit v1 (PacBio, 102-817-600) with 2 h pre-extension and 24 h movies on SMRT Link v.12.0.

To generate UL sequencing reads >100 kb, we used ONT sequencing. Ultra-high molecular mass gDNA was extracted from the lymphoblastoid cell lines according to a previously published protocol64. In brief, 3–5 × 107 cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.1 M EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and 20 mg ml−1 RNase A for 1 h at 37 °C. Then, 200 μg ml−1 proteinase K was added, and the solution was incubated at 50 °C for 2 h. DNA was purified through two rounds of 25:24:1 phenol–chloroform–isoamyl alcohol extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. Precipitated DNA was solubilized in 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) containing 0.02% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 2 days.

Libraries were constructed using the Ultra-Long DNA Sequencing Kit (ONT, SQK-ULK001) with modifications to the manufacturer's protocol: ~40 μg of DNA was mixed with FRA enzyme and FDB buffer as described in the protocol and incubated for 5 min at room temperature, followed by heat inactivation for 5 min at 75 °C. RAP enzyme was mixed with the DNA solution and incubated at room temperature for 1 h before the clean-up step. Clean-up was performed using the Nanobind UL Library Prep Kit (Circulomics, NB-900-601-01) and eluted in 450 μl EB. Then, 75 μl of library was loaded onto a primed FLO-PRO002 R9.4.1 flow cell for sequencing on the PromethION (using MinKNOW software v.21.02.17–23.04.5), with two nuclease washes and reloads after 24 and 48 h of sequencing. All G1–G3 ONT base calling was done with Guppy (v.6.3.7).

Element WGS data were generated according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In brief, DNA was extracted from whole blood as described above. PCR-free libraries were prepared using mechanical shearing, yielding ~350 bp fragments, and the Element Elevate library preparation kit (Element Biosciences, 830-00008). Linear libraries were quantified by quantitative PCR and sequenced on AVITI 2 × 150 bp flow cells (Element Biosciences, not yet commercially available). Bases2Fastq Software (Element Biosciences) was used to generate demultiplexed FASTQ files.

Single-cell Strand-seq libraries were prepared using a streamlined version of the established OP-Strand-seq protocol65 with the following modifications. In brief, EBV cells from G1–3 were cultured for 24 h in the presence of BrdU and nuclei with BrdU in the G1 phase of the cell cycle were sorted using fluorescence-activated cell sorting as described previously65. Next, single nuclei were dispensed into individual wells of an open 72 × 72 well nanowell array and treated with heat-labile protease, followed by digestion of DNA with the restriction enzymes AluI and HpyCH4V (NEB) instead of micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Next, fragments were A-tailed, ligated to forked adapters, UV-treated and PCR-amplified with index primers. The use of restriction enzymes results in short, reproducible, blunt-ended DNA fragments (>90% smaller than 1 kb) that do not require end-repair before adapter ligation, in contrast to the ends of DNA generated by MNase. Omitting end-repair enzymes allows dispensing of index primers in advance of dispensing individual nuclei. The pre-spotted, dried primers survive and do not interfere with the library preparation steps before PCR amplification. Pre-spotting of index primers is more reliable than the transfer of index primers between arrays during library preparation as described previously65. Strand-seq libraries were pooled and cleaned with AMPure XP beads, and library fragments between 300 and 700 bp were gel purified before PE75 sequencing on either the NextSeq 550 or the AVITI (Element Biosciences) system. Supplementary Fig. 40 shows examples of Strand-seq libraries made with restriction enzymes.

The demultiplexed FASTQ files were aligned to both GRCh38 and T2T-CHM13 reference assemblies (Supplementary Table 14) using BWA66 (v.0.7.17-r1188) for standard library selection. Aligned reads were sorted by genomic position using SAMtools67 (v.1.10) and duplicate reads were marked using sambamba68 (v.1.0). Libraries passing quality filters were pre-selected using ASHLEYS69 (v.0.2.0). We also evaluated such selected Strand-seq libraries manually and further excluded libraries with an uneven coverage, or an excess of ‘background reads' (reads mapped in opposing orientation for chromosomes expected to inherit only Crick or Watson strands) as previously described70. This is done to ensure accurate inversion detection and phasing.

Polymorphic inversions for G1–G3 were detected by mapping Strand-seq read orientation with respect to the reference genome as previously described71,72. For each sample, we selected 60+ Strand-seq libraries (range, 62–90) with a median of around 274,000 reads with mapping quality ≥10 per library, translating to about 0.67% genome (T2T-CHM13) being covered per library (Supplementary Fig. 41). Then we ran breakpointR73 (v.1.15.1) across selected Strand-seq libraries to detect points of strand-state changes73. We used these results to generate sample-specific composite files using breakpointR function ‘synchronizeReadDir' as described previously71. Again, we ran breakpointR on such composite files to detect regions where Strand-seq reads map in reverse orientation and are indicative of an inversion. Lastly, we manually evaluated each reported inverted region by inspection of Strand-seq read mapping in UCSC Genome Browser74 and removed any low-confidence calls. We phased all inversions using Strand-seq data as well and then synchronized the phase with phased genome assemblies based on haplotype concordance. Lastly, we evaluated the Mendelian concordance of detected and fully phased inversions. We mark sites where at least half of the G3 samples were fully phased by Strand-seq and concordant with possible inherited G2 parental alleles as being Mendelian concordant (Supplementary Table 7).

Phased genome assemblies were generated using two different algorithms, namely Verkko (v.1.3.1 and v.1.4.1)16 and hifiasm (UL) with ONT support (v.0.19.5)17. Owing to active development of the Verkko and hifiasm algorithms, assemblies were generated with two different versions. Phased assemblies for G2–G3 were generated using a combination of HiFi and ONT reads using parental Illumina k-mers for phasing. To generate phased genome assemblies of G1, we still used a combination of HiFi and ONT reads with the Verkko pipeline and used Strand-seq to phase assembly graphs75. Lastly, G4 samples were assembled using HiFi reads only with hifiasm (v.0.19.5).

Note that trio-based phasing with Verkko assigns maternal to haplotype 1 and paternal to haplotype 2. By contrast, for hifiasm assemblies, we report switched haplotype labelling such that haplotype 1 is paternal and haplotype 2 is maternal to match HPRC standard for hifiasm assemblies.

To evaluate the base pair and structural accuracy of each phased assembly, we used a multitude of assembly evaluation tools as well as orthogonal datasets such as PacBio HiFi, ONT, Strand-seq, Illumina and Element data. Known assembly issues are listed in Supplementary Table 4. We note that we fixed four haplotype switch errors in our assembly-based variant callsets to avoid biases in subsequent analysis. The assembly-quality terminology used in this Article is described in Supplementary Note 8.

We used Strand-seq data to evaluate directional and structural accuracy of each phased assembly. First, we aligned selected Strand-seq libraries for each sample to the phased de novo assembly using BWA66 (v.0.7.17-r1188). We next ran breakpointR73 (v.1.15.1) using aligned BAM files as the input. We then created directional composite files using the breakpointR function createCompositeFiles followed by running breakpointR on such composite files using the runBreakpointR function. This provided us, for any given sample, with regions where strand-state changes across all single-cell Strand-seq libraries. Many such regions point to real heterozygous inversions. However, regions where Strand-seq reads mapped in opposite orientation with respect to surrounding regions are probably caused by misorientation. Moreover, positions where the strand state of Strand-seq reads changes repeatedly in multiple libraries might be a sign of an assembly misjoin and such regions were investigated more closely to rule out any such large structural assembly inconsistencies.

To evaluate de novo assembly accuracy, we aligned sample-specific PacBio HiFi reads to their corresponding phased genome assemblies using Winnowmap76 (v.2.03) with the following parameters:


-I 10G -Y -ax map-pb --MD --cs -L --eqx


Flagger9 was used to detect misassemblies using HiFi read alignments to the assemblies and the assemblies aligned to the reference genome. Regions were flagged on the basis of read alignment divergence and specific reference-biased regions. A reference-specific BED file (chm13v2.0.sd.bed) was used, setting a maximum read divergence of 2% and specifying reference-biased blocks. These flagged regions were analysed to identify collapses, false duplications, erroneous regions and correctly assembled haploid blocks with the expected read coverage.

We used Flagger v.0.3.3 (https://github.com/mobinasri/flagger) to run the flagger_end_to_end WDL.

Required inputs include following:

Read-to-contig alignments—Winnowmap alignments of all HiFi reads to the assembly (hap1, hap2 and unassigned.fasta)

A combined assembly fasta file with hap1, hap2 and unassigned contigs

BAM alignments of assembly to the CHM13v2.0 reference

hap1, hap2 and unassigned fasta files of the assembly were aligned to CHM13v2.0 using a pipeline available at GitHub (https://github.com/mrvollger/asm-to-reference-alignment).

NucFreq77 (v.0.1) was used to calculate nucleotide frequencies for HiFi reads aligned using Winnowmap76 (v.2.03). This was used to identify regions of collapses, where the second-highest nucleotide count exceeded 5; and misassembly, where all nucleotide counts were zero.

The NucFreq analysis pipeline is available at GitHub (https://github.com/mrvollger/NucFreq).

To evaluate the accuracy of the genome assembly, we used a pipeline that uses Meryl78 (v.1.0) to count the k-mers of length 21 from Illumina reads using the following command:

meryl k=21 count {input.fastq} output {output.meryl}

We then used Merqury78 (v.1.1), which compares the k-mers from the sequencing reads against those in the assembled genome and flags discrepancies where k-mers are uniquely found only in the assembly. These unique k-mers indicate potential base-pair errors. Merqury then calculates the quality value based on the k-mer survival rate, estimated from Meryl's k-mer counts, providing a quantitative measure to assess the completeness and correctness of the genome assembly.

To evaluate the completeness of single-copy genes in our assemblies, we used compleasm79 (v.0.2.4). Further details are available at GitHub (https://github.com/huangnengCSU/compleasm).

We ran compleasm with the following parameters:


compleasm.py run -a {assembly.fasta} -o results/{sample.id} -t {threads} -l {params.lineage} -m {params.mode} -L {params.mb_downloads}



-l primates
-m busco
-L {params.mb_downloads}


and downloaded using: compleasm_kit/compleasm.py download primates.

All de novo assemblies were aligned to both GRCh38 as well as to the complete version of the human reference genome T2T-CHM13 (v2) using minimap2 (ref. 80) (v.2.24) with the following command:


minimap2 -K 8G -t {threads} -ax asm20 \


--secondary=no --eqx -s 25000 \


{input.ref} {input.query} \
| samtools view -F 4 -b - > {output.bam}


A complete pipeline for this reference alignment is available at GitHub: (https://github.com/mrvollger/asm-to-reference-alignment).

We also generated a trimmed version of these alignments using the rustybam (v.0.1.33) (https://github.com/mrvollger/rustybam) function trim-paf to trim redundant alignments that mostly appear at highly identical SDs. With this, we aim to reduce the effect of multiple alignments of a single contig over these duplicated regions.

For this analysis, we use assembly to reference alignments (see the ‘Assembly to reference alignment' section), reported as PAF files. We used trimmed PAF files reported by the rustybam trim-paf function. Stable diploid regions were defined as regions where phased genome assemblies report exactly one contig alignment for haplotype 1 as well as haplotype 2 and are assigned as ‘2n' regions. Any region with two or more alignments per haplotype is assigned as ‘multi' alignment. Lastly, regions with only single-contig alignment in a single haplotype are assigned as ‘1n' regions. These reports were generated using the ‘getPloidy' R function (Code availability).

We constructed a high-resolution recombination map of G2 and G3 individuals using three orthogonal approaches that differ either on the basis of the underlying sequencing technology or on the detection algorithm applied to the data. The first approach is based on chromosome-length haplotypes extracted from Strand-seq data using R package StrandPhaseR81 (v.0.99). The second approach uses inheritance vectors derived from Mendelian consistency of small variants across the family pedigree13. Our final approach uses trio-based phased genome assemblies followed by small variant calling using PAV and Dipcall to more precisely define the meiotic breakpoints.

By contrast, a recombination map of G4 individuals was constructed using a combination of Strand-seq data for G3 spouses and an assembly-based variant callset (Dipcall) of G4 samples. Owing to the use of a low-variant density of Strand-seq-based haplotypes of G4 spouses, reported recombination breakpoints are of lower resolution in comparison to G2 and G3 samples (Supplementary Table 8).

To map meiotic recombination breakpoints using circular binary segmentation, we used two different datasets. The first dataset represents phased small variants (SNVs and indels) as reported by Strand-seq-based (SSQ) phasing22,81. The other is based on small variants reported in trio-based phased assemblies either by PAV8 (v.2.3.4) or Dipcall82 (v.0.3). With this approach, we set to detect recombination breakpoints as positions where a child's haplotype switches from matching H1 to H2 of a given parent or vice versa. To detect these positions, we first established which homologue in a child was inherited from either parent by calculating the level of agreement between child's alleles and homozygous variants in each parent. Next, we compared each child's homologue to both homologues of the corresponding parent and encoded them as 0 or 1 if they match H1 or H2, respectively. We applied a circular binary segmentation algorithm on such binary vectors by using the R function fastseg implemented in the R package fastseg83 (v.1.46.0) with the following parameters: fastseg (binary.vector, minSeg={}, segMedianT=c (0.8, 0.2)). In the case of sparse Strand-seq haplotypes, we set the fastseg parameter minSeg to 20 and, in the case of dense assembly-based haplotypes, we used a larger window of 400 and 500 for Dipcall- and PAV-based variant calls to achieve comparable sensitivity in detecting recombination breakpoints. The regions with a segmentation mean of ≤0.25 are then marked as H1 while regions with a segmentation mean of ≥0.75 are assigned as H2. Regions with a segmentation mean in between these values were deemed to be ambiguous and were excluded. Moreover, we filtered out regions shorter than 500 kb and merged consecutive regions assigned the same haplotype (Code availability).

DeepVariant calls (see the ‘Read-based variant calling' section) from HiFi sequencing data from G1, G2 and G3 pedigree members allow us to identify the haplotype of origin for heterozygous loci in G3 and infer the occurrence of a recombination along the chromosome when the haplotype of origin changes between loci. An initial outline of the inheritance vectors was identified by first applying a depth filter to remove variants outside the expected coverage distribution per sample; inheritance was then sketched out using a custom script, requiring a minimum of 10 SNVs supporting a particular haplotype, and manually refined to remove biologically unlikely haplotype blocks, or add additional haplotype blocks, where support existed, and refine haplotype coordinates. Missing recombinations were identified from the occurrence of blocks of pedigree-violating variants, matching the location of assembly-based recombination calls. We developed a hidden Markov model framework to identify the most probable sequence of inheritance vectors from SNV sites using the Viterbi algorithm. For details including the transition/emission probabilities see ref. 18 and the associated GitHub repository (https://github.com/Platinum-Pedigree-Consortium/Platinum-Pedigree-Inheritance).

The transition matrix defines the probability of a given inheritance state transition (recombination). The emission matrix defines the probability that a variant call at a particular locus accurately describes the inheritance state. The values contained within transition and emission matrices were refined to recapitulate the previously identified inheritance vectors, while correctly identifying missing vectors. The Viterbi algorithm identified 539 recombinations, a maternal recombination rate of 1.29 cM per Mb, and a paternal recombination rate of 0.99 cM per Mb. Maternal bias was observed in the pedigree, with 57% of recombinations identified in G3 of maternal origin.

Meiotic recombination breakpoints reported by different orthogonal technologies and algorithms (see the sections ‘Detection of meiotic recombination breakpoints using circular binary segmentation' and ‘Detection of meiotic recombination breakpoints using inheritance vectors') were merged separately for G2 and G3 samples. We started with the G3 recombination map where we used an inheritance-based map as a reference and then looked for support of each reference breakpoint in recombination maps reported based on PAV, Dipcall and Strand-seq (SSQ) phased variants. A recombination breakpoint was supported if for a given sample and homologue an orthogonal technology reported a breakpoint no further than 1 Mb from the reference breakpoint. Any recombination breakpoint that is further apart is reported as unique. We repeated this for the G2 recombination map as well. However, in the case of the G2 recombination map, we used a PAV-based map as a reference. This is because inheritance-based approaches need three generations to map recombination breakpoints in G3. We also report a column called ‘best.range', which is the narrowest breakpoint across all orthogonal recombination maps that directly overlaps with a given reference breakpoint. Lastly, we report a ‘min.range' column that represents for any given breakpoint a range with the highest coverage across all orthogonal datasets. Merged recombination breakpoints are reported in Supplementary Table 8.

We tested enrichment of all (n = 1,503) recombination breakpoints detected in G2–G4 with respect to T2T-CHM13 if they cluster towards the ends of the chromosomes depending on parental homologue origin. For this, we counted the number of recombination breakpoints in the last 5% of each chromosome end specifically for maternal and paternal breakpoints. We then shuffle detected recombination breakpoints along each chromosome 1,000 times and redo the counts. For the permutation analysis, we used the R package regioneR84 (v.1.32.0) and its function permTest with the following parameters:


permTest(
A=breakpoints, B=chrEnds.regions,
randomize.function=circularRandomizeRegions,
evaluate.function=numOverlaps,
genome=genome, ntimes=1000,
allow.overlaps=FALSE, per.chromosome=TRUE,
mask=region.mask, count.once=FALSE)


Up to this point, all meiotic recombination breakpoints were called using variation detected with respect to a single linear reference (GRCh38 or T2T-CHM13). To alleviate any possible biases introduced by comparison to a single reference genome, we set out to refine detected recombination breakpoints for each inherited homologue (in child) directly in comparison to parental haplotypes from whom the homologue was inherited from. We start with a set of merged T2T-CHM13 reference breakpoints for G3 only by selecting the ‘best.range' column (Supplementary Table 8). Then, for each breakpoint, we set a ‘lookup' region to 750 kb on each side from the breakpoint boundaries and used the SVbyEye85 (v.0.99.0) function subsetPafAlignments to subset PAF alignments of a phased assembly to the reference (T2T-CHM13) to a given region. We next extract the FASTA sequence for a given region from the phased assembly. We did this separately for inherited child homologues (recombined) and the corresponding parental haplotypes that belong to a parent from whom the child homologue was inherited from.

Next, we created a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) for three sequences (child-inherited homologue, parental homologue 1 and parental homologue 2) using the R package DECIPHER86 (v.2.28.0; with the function AlignSeqs). Fasta sequences of which the size differ by more than 100 kb or their nucleotide frequencies differ by more than 10,000 bases are skipped due to increased computational time needed to align such different sequences optimally using DECIPHER. After MSA construction, we selected positions with at least one mismatch and also removed sites where both parental haplotypes carry the same allele. A recombination breakpoint is a region where the inherited child homologue is partly matching alleles coming from parental homologues 1 and 2. We therefore skipped analysis of MSAs in which a child's alleles are more than 99% identical to a single parental homologue. If this filter is passed, we use the custom R function getAlleleChangepoints (Code availability) to detect changepoints where the child's inherited haplotype switches from matching alleles coming from parental haplotype 1 to alleles coming from parental haplotype 2. Such MSA-specific changepoints are then reported as a new range where a recombination breakpoint probably occurred. Lastly, we attempt to report reference coordinates of such MSA-specific breakpoints by extracting 1 kb long k-mers from the breakpoint boundaries and matching such k-mers against reference sequence (per chromosome) using R package Biostrings (v.2.70.2) with its function ‘matchPattern' and allowing for up to 10 mismatches. A list of refined recombination breakpoints is reported in Supplementary Table 8.

We set out to detect smaller localized changes in parental allele inheritance using a previously defined recombination map of this family. We did this analysis for all G3 samples (n = 8) in comparison to G2 parents. For this, we iterated over each child's homologue (in each sample) and compared it to both parental homologues from which the child's homologue was inherited from. We did this by comparing SNV and indel calls obtained from phased genome assemblies between the child and corresponding parent. To consider only reliable variants, we retained only those supported by at least two read-based callers (either DeepVariant-HiFi, Clair3-ONT or dragen-Illumina callset). We further retained only variable sites that are heterozygous in the parent and were also called in the child. After such strict variant filtering, we slide by two consecutive child's variants at a time and compare them to both haplotype 1 and haplotype 2 of the respective parent of origin. For this similarity calculation, we use the custom R function getHaplotypeSimilarity (Code Availability). Then, for each haplotype segment, defined by recombination breakpoints, we report regions where at least two consecutive variants match the opposing parental haplotype in contrast to the expected parental homologue defined by recombination map. We further merge consecutive regions that are ≤5 kb apart. For the list of putative gene conversion events, we retained only regions that have not been reported as problematic by Flagger. We also removed regions that are ≤100 kb from previously defined recombination events and events that overlap centromeric satellite regions and highly identical SDs (≥99% identical). Lastly, we evaluated the list of putative allelic gene conversion events by visual inspection of phased HiFi reads.

PacBio HiFi data were processed with the human-WGS-WDL available at GitHub (https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/HiFi-human-WGS-WDL/releases/tag/v1.0.3). The pipeline aligns, phases and calls small variants (using DeepVariant87 v.1.6.0) and SVs (using PBSV v.2.9.0; https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbsv). We used the aligned haplotype-tagged HiFi BAMs for all downstream PacBio analysis.

Clair3 (ref. 88) (v.1.0.7) variant calls were made based on the alignments with default models for PacBio HiFi and ONT (ont_guppy5) data, respectively, with phasing and gVCF generation enabled. Variant calling was conducted on each chromosome individually and concatenated into one VCF. gVCFs were then fed into GLNexus89 with a custom configuration file.

ONT reads for Clair3 calling were aligned with minimap2 (v.2.21) with the following parameters: -L --MD --secondary=no --eqx -x map-ont.

We used a previously established framework to define ground truth genetic variation13. Our analysis, in contrast to trio-based filtering, uses all four alleles to detect genotyping errors, whereas, in a trio, only two alleles are transmitted and observed. By testing the genotype patterns in the third generation against the phased haplotypes of the first generation (A,B,C,D), we can test for the correct transmission of alleles from the second to third generations. We establish a map of the haplotypes across the third generation (inheritance vector) from which we can adjudicate variant calls against. To test for pedigree consistency, we implemented code that uses the inheritance vector as the expected haplotypes and test the possible genotype configurations within the query VCF file. Using the haplotype structure, we phase the pedigree consistent variants. These functions are implemented as a single binary tool that requires the inheritance vectors and a standard formatted VCF file, for example:


concordance -i ceph.grch38.hifi.g3.csv –father NA12877 –mother NA12878 –vcf input.vcf –prefix pedigree_filtered > info.stdout


The pedigree filtering and additional steps to build a small variant truth set are available at GitHub (https://github.com/Platinum-Pedigree-Consortium/Platinum-Pedigree-Inheritance).

Following the parameters outlined previously10, we called variants in HiFi data aligned to T2T-CHM13 using GATK HaplotypeCaller90 (v.4.3.0.0) and DeepVariant87 (v.1.4.0) and naively identified variants unique to each G2 and G3 sample. We separated out SNV and indel calls and applied basic quality filters, such as removing clusters of three or more SNVs in a 1 kb window. We combined this set of variant calls generated by a secondary calling method (https://github.com/Platinum-Pedigree-Consortium/Platinum-Pedigree-Inheritance/blob/main/analyses/Denovo.md) and subjected all calls to the following validation process.

We validated both SNVs and indels by examining them in HiFi, ONT and Illumina read data, excluding reads that failed to reach the mapping quality (59 for long reads, 0 for short reads) thresholds. Reads with high base quality (>20) and low base quality (<20) at the variant site were counted separately. We retained variants that were present in at least two types of sequencing data for the child, and absent from high-base-quality parental reads. For SNV calls, we next examined HiFi data for every sample in the pedigree. We determined an SNV was truly de novo if it was absent from every family member that was not a direct descendant of the de novo sample. Finally, we examined the allele balance of every variant, determined which variants were in TRs and re-evaluated parental read data across all sequencing platforms, removing variants with noisy sequencing data or more than two low-quality parental reads supporting the alternative allele (Supplementary Note 9).

To determine the parent of origin for the de novo SNVs, we re-examined the long reads containing the de novo allele. First, we used our initial GATK variant calls to identify informative sites in an 80 kb window around the DNM, selecting any single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) where one allele could be uniquely assigned to one parent (for example, a site that is homozygous reference in a father and heterozygous in a mother). For every DNM, we evaluated every ONT and HiFi read that aligned to the site of the de novo allele and assigned it to either a paternal or maternal haplotype (if informative SNPs were available) by calculating an inheritance score as outlined previously10. DNMs that were exclusively assigned to maternal or paternal haplotypes were successfully phased, whereas DNMs on conflicting haplotypes were excluded from our final callset. Unphased variants were determined to be postzygotic in origin (n = 7) if their allele balance was not significantly different across platforms (by a χ2 test) and if their combined allele balance was significantly different from 0.5.

Once we assigned every read to a parental haplotype, we counted the number of maternal and paternal reads that had either the reference or alternative allele. We determined that a DNM was germline in origin if it was present on every read from a given parent's haplotype. Conversely, if a DNM was present on only a fraction of reads from a parental haplotype, we determined that it was postzygotic in origin.

To identify DNMs on the X chromosome, we applied the same strategy as autosomal variants, with one exception: we used only variant calls generated by GATK. For male individuals, we reran GATK in haploid mode, such that it would only identify one genotype on the X chromosome.

To identify DNMs on the Y chromosome, we aligned male HiFi, ONT and Illumina data to the G1-NA12889 chromosome Y assembly and then called variants using GATK in haploid mode on the aligned HiFi data. We directly compared each male to his father, selecting variants unique to the son. We validated SNVs and indels by examining the father's HiFi, ONT and Illumina data and excluded any variants that were present in the parental reads, applying the same logic that we used for autosomal variants.

To determine where we were able to identify de novo variation in the genome, we assessed HiFi data for every trio. We first used GATK HaplotypeCaller90 (v.4.3.0.0) with the option ‘ERC BP_RESOLUTION' to generate a genotype call at every site in the genome. Only sites where both parents were genotyped as homozygous reference (0/0) were considered callable, as sites with a parental alternative allele were excluded from our de novo discovery pipeline. We then examined the HiFi reads from a sample and its parents, restricting to only primary alignments with mapping quality of at least 59. For children, we only considered HiFi reads derived from blood, but we considered blood and cell line data for parents. We counted the number of reads with a minimum base quality score of 20 at every site in the genome and then combined this information with our variant calls. A site was deemed to be callable if both parents and the child each had at least one high-quality read with a high-quality base call. We observed an average of 2.67 Gb of accessible sequence across the autosomes (out of 2.90 Gb total, s.d. = 24.9 Mb). For female children, callable X chromosome was determined in the same way, whereas, for the male children, we only considered the mother's HiFi data when examining the X chromosome and the father's HiFi data when examining the Y chromosome. Moreover, male sex chromosomes were not restricted to sites where both parents were genotyped as reference—each parent was allowed to carry an alternative allele.

We calculated the germline autosomal mutation rate for every sample by dividing the number of germline autosomal DNMs by twice the number of base pairs we determined to be callable. For PZMs, we used the same denominator. In female individuals, the amount of callable sex chromosomes was defined as twice the number of callable bases on the X chromosome, and in males it was defined as the sum of the callable bases on the X and Y chromosomes. For each feature-specific mutation rate (such as SDs), we intersected both a sample's de novo SNVs and the sample's callable regions with coordinates of the relevant feature. We then calculated the mutation rate by dividing the number of SNVs in the region by the amount of callable genomic sequence where alignments could be reliably made.

Given the challenges associated with assaying mutations in STRs (1–6 bp motifs) and VNTRs (≥7 bp motifs), we applied a targeted HiFi genotyping strategy coupled with validation by transmission and orthogonal sequencing.

The command trf-mod -s 20 -l 160 {reference.fasta} was used, resulting in a minimum reference locus size of 10 bp and motif sizes of 1 to 2,000 bp (https://github.com/lh3/TRF-mod)91. Loci within 50 bp were merged, and then any loci >10,000 bp were discarded. The remaining loci were annotated with tr-solve (https://github.com/trgt-paper/tr-solve) to resolve locus structure in compound loci. Only TRs annotated on Chromosomes 1–22, X and Y were considered (Data availability).

TRGT32 is a software tool for genotyping TR alleles using PacBio HiFi sequencing reads (https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/trgt). Provided with aligned HiFi sequencing reads (in BAM format) and a file that enumerates the genomic locations and motif structures of a collection of TR loci, TRGT will return a VCF file with inferred genotypes at each TR locus. In this analysis, we ran TRGT (v.0.7.0-493ef25) on each member of the CEPH 1463 pedigree using the TR catalogue defined above. TRGT was run using the default parameters:


trgt --threads 32 --genome {in_reference} --repeats {in_bed} --reads {in_bam} --output-prefix {out_prefix} --karyotype {karyotype}`
bcftools sort -m 3072M -Ob -o {out_prefix}.sorted.vcf.gz {out_prefix}.vcf.gz
bcftools index --threads 4 {out_prefix}.sorted.vcf.gz
samtools sort -@ 8 -o {out_prefix}.spanning.sorted.bam {out_prefix}.spanning.bam
samtools index -@ 8 {out_prefix}.spanning.sorted.bam


To determine the concordant inheritance of TRs, we calculated the possible Manhattan distances derived from all possible combinations of a proband's allele length (AL) from TRGT with both the maternal and paternal AL values. We considered a locus to be concordant if the minimum Manhattan distance from all computed distances was found to be 0, suggesting that a combination of the proband's AL values matched the parental AL values perfectly. By contrast, if the minimum Manhattan distance was greater than 0, suggesting that all combinations of the proband's AL values exhibited some deviation from the parental AL values, we regarded the locus as discordant and recorded it as a potential Mendelian inheritance error. For each TR locus, we calculated the number of concordant trios, the number of MIE trios and the number of trios that had missing values and could not be fully genotyped. Loci with any missing genotypes were excluded when calculating the percent concordance; however, individual complete trios were considered for de novo variant calling below.

We focused de novo TR calling on G3 for several reasons. First, their G2 parents (NA12877 and NA12878) were sequenced to 99 and 109 HiFi sequencing depths, resulting in a far lower chance of parental allelic dropout than samples with more modest sequencing depths. Second, G1 DNA was derived from cell lines, increasing the risk of artefacts when calling DNMs in G2. And finally, DNMs in the two individuals in G3 with sequenced children in our study can be further assessed by transmission.

We used TRGT-denovo33 (v.0.1.3), a companion tool to TRGT, to enable in-depth analysis of TR DNMs in family trios using HiFi sequencing data (https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/trgt-denovo). TRGT-denovo uses consensus allele sequences and genotyping data generated by TRGT and also incorporates additional evidence from spanning HiFi reads used to predict these allele sequences. In brief, TRGT-denovo extracts and partitions spanning reads from each family member (mother, father and child) to their most likely alleles. Parental spanning reads are realigned to each of the two consensus allele sequences in the child, and alignment scores (which summarize the difference between a parental read and a consensus allele sequence) are computed for each read. At every TR locus, each of the two child alleles is independently considered as a putative de novo candidate. For each child allele, TRGT-denovo reports the presence or absence of evidence for a de novo event, which includes the following: denovo_coverage (the number of reads supporting a unique AL in the child that is absent from the parent's reads); overlap_coverage (the number of reads in the parents supporting an AL that is highly similar to the putative de novo allele); and magnitude of the putative de novo event (expressed as the absolute mean difference of the read alignment scores with de novo coverage relative to the closest parental allele).

We measured the sizes of de novo TR alleles with respect to the parental TR allele that most likely experienced a contraction or expansion event. If TRGT-denovo reported a de novo expansion or contraction at a particular locus, we did the following to calculate the size of the event.

Given the ALs reported by TRGT for each member of the trio, we computed the difference in size (which we call a ‘diff') between the de novo TR allele in the child and all four TR alleles in the child's parents. For example, if TRGT reported ALs of 100,100 in the father, 50,150 in the mother, and 200,100 in the child, and the allele of length 200 was reported to be de novo in the child, the diffs would be 100,100 in the father and 150,50 in the mother. If we were able to phase the de novo TR allele to a parent of origin, we simply identify the minimum diff among that parent's ALs and treat it as the likely expansion/contraction size. Otherwise, we assume that the smallest diff across all parental ALs represents the likely de novo size.

We applied a series of filters to the candidate TR DNMs (identified by TRGT-denovo) to remove likely false positives. For each de novo allele observed in a child, we required the following (Supplementary Notes 9 and 10):

HiFi sequencing depth in the child, mother, and father ≥10 reads.

The candidate de novo AL in the child must be unique: as in ref. 37, we removed candidate de novo TR alleles if (1) the child's de novo AL matched one of the father's ALs and the child's non-de novo AL matched one of the mother's ALs or (2) the child's de novo AL matched one of the mother's ALs and the child's non-de novo AL matched one of the father's ALs.

The candidate de novo allele must represent an expansion or contraction with respect to the parental allele.

At least two HiFi reads supporting the candidate de novo allele (denovo_coverage ≥ 2) in the child, and at least 20% of total reads supporting the candidate de novo allele (child_ratio ≥ 0.2).

Fewer than 5% of parental reads likely supporting the candidate de novo AL in the child.

To calculate TR DNM rates in a given individual, we first calculated the total number of TR loci (among the ~7.8 million loci genotyped using TRGT) that were covered by at least 10 HiFi sequencing reads in each member of the focal individual's trio (that is, the focal individual and both of their parents). We then divided the total count of de novo TR alleles by the total number of callable loci to obtain an overall DNM rate, expressed per locus per generation. Finally, we divided that rate by 2 to produce a mutation rate expressed per locus, per haplotype, per generation. As shown in Fig. 3a, we also estimated DNM rates as a function of the minimum motif size observed within a locus. For example, a locus with motif structure AT(n)AGA(n)T(n) would have a minimum motif size of 1. We counted the number of TR DNMs that occurred at loci with a minimum motif size of N and divided that count by the total number of TR loci with a minimum motif size of N that passed filtering thresholds. We then divided that rate by 2 to produce a mutation rate per locus, per haplotype, per generation. When calculating STR, VNTR and complex mutation rates, we defined STR loci as loci at which all constituent motifs were between 1 and 6 bp; we defined VNTR loci as loci at which all motifs were larger than 6 bp; and we defined complex loci as loci at which there were both STR (1–6 bp) and VNTR (≥7 bp) motifs. For example, both an A(n) locus and an AT(n)AGA(n)T(n) locus would be classified as STRs, as they both purely contain STR motifs.

Previous studies usually measured STR mutation rates at loci that are polymorphic within the cohort of interest. To generate mutation rate estimates that are more consistent with these previous studies, we also calculated the number of STR loci that were polymorphic within the CEPH 1463 pedigree. Loci were defined as polymorphic if at least two unique ALs were observed among the CEPH 1463 individuals at a given TR locus. We note that this definition of polymorphic STRs is sensitive to both the size of the cohort and the sequencing technology used to genotype STRs. As discussed in previous studies37, the number of polymorphic loci is proportional to the size of the cohort. Moreover, by defining loci as polymorphic if we observed more than one unique AL across the cohort, we may erroneously classify loci as polymorphic if HiFi sequencing reads exhibited a substantial amount of stutter at those loci, producing variable estimates of STR ALs across individuals. In total, 1,096,430 STRs were polymorphic within the cohort. To calculate mutation rates in each G3 individual, we applied the same coverage quality thresholds as described above.

The STRs genotyped by TRGT were phased using HiPhase92 (v.1.0.0-f1bc7a8). We followed HiPhase's guidelines for jointly phasing small variants, SVs and TRs by inputting the relevant VCF files from DeepVariant, PBSV and TRGT into HiPhase, resulting in three phased VCF files for each analysed sample. We also activated global realignment through the --global-realignment-cputime parameter to improve allele assignment accuracy. Note that HiPhase specifically excludes variants that fall entirely within genotyped STRs from the phasing process. This is motivated because STRs often encompass numerous smaller variants.

We used the phased genotypes inferred by HiPhase to determine the likely parent of origin for de novo TR expansions and contractions. For each phased de novo allele that we observed in a child, we examined all informative SNVs in that child's parents ±500 kb from the de novo allele. We defined informative sites using the following criteria: sites must be biallelic SNVs; total read depth in the mother, father and child must be at least 10 reads; Phred-scaled genotype quality in the mother, father and child must be at least 20; the child's genotype must be heterozygous; and the parents' genotypes must not be identical-by-state. Using the child's phased SNV VCF, we then determine whether the child's REF or ALT allele at the informative site was inherited from either the mother or father. For example, if the mother's genotype is 0/0, the father's genotype is 0/1 (note that the parental genotypes need not be phased), and the child's genotype is 1|0, we know that the child's first haplotype was inherited from the father and the second haplotype was inherited from the mother. We repeat this process for all informative sites within the ±500 kb interval. We then find the N informative sites that are (1) closest to the de novo TR allele (either upstream or downstream) while (2) supporting a consistent inheritance pattern in the child (that is, all support the same parent of origin for the child's two haplotypes) and (3) all reside within the same HiPhase phase block (defined using the PS tag in the HiPhase output VCF). Finally, we use the phased TR VCF produced by HiPhase to check whether the de novo allele was phased to either the first or second haplotype in the child. We then confirm that the de novo allele shares the same PS tag as the informative sites identified above and use the N informative sites to determine whether the haplotype to which the de novo allele was phased was probably inherited from either the mother or the father.

At each candidate de novo TR allele, we calculated concordance between the de novo ALs estimated by TRGT and the ALs supported by Element, ONT or HiFi reads. We restricted our concordance analyses to autosomal TR loci with a single expansion or contraction (that is, we did not analyse ‘complex' TR loci containing multiple unique expansions and/or contractions).

TRGT reports two AL estimates for every member of a trio at an autosomal TR locus, and TRGT-denovo assigns one of these two ALs to be the de novo AL in the child. At each TR locus, we calculated the difference between the length of the locus in the reference genome (in base pairs) and each of the two ALs in a given individual. We refer to the difference between the TRGT AL and the reference locus size as the relative AL. We then queried BAM files containing Element, Illumina, ONT or PacBio HiFi reads at each TR locus. Using the pysam library (https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam), we iterated over all reads that completely spanned the TR locus and had a mapping quality of 60. To estimate the AL of a TR expansion/contraction in a read with respect to the reference genome, we counted the number of nucleotides associated with every CIGAR operation that overlapped the TR locus. For example, an Element read might have the following CIGAR string: 100M2D10M6I32M. For each of the CIGAR operations that overlap the TR locus, we increment a counter by OP * BP, where OP equals 0 for ‘match' CIGAR operations, 1 for ‘insertion' operations, and -1 for ‘deletion' operations, and BP equals the number of base pairs associated with the given CIGAR operation. Thus, at each TR locus, we generated a distribution of net CIGAR operations in each member of the trio.

We used these net CIGAR operations to validate candidate de novo TR alleles in each child. For each de novo TR allele, we calculated the number of Element reads in the child that supported the de novo AL estimated by TRGT (allowing the Element reads to support the de novo AL ± 1 bp). We then calculated the number of Element reads in that child's parents supporting the de novo AL (also allowing for off-by-one errors). If at least one Element read supported the de novo TR AL in the child, and zero Element reads supported the de novo TR AL in both parents, we considered the de novo TR to be validated.

To assemble a confident list of candidate recurrent de novo TR alleles, we first assembled a list of TR loci where two or more CEPH 1463 individuals (in either G2, G3 or G4) harboured evidence for a de novo TR allele. For each candidate locus, we then required that all members of the CEPH 1463 pedigree were genotyped for a TR allele at the locus and had at least 10 aligned HiFi reads at the locus. These filters produced a list of 49 candidate loci where we observed evidence of either intragenerational or intergenerational recurrence. We visually inspected HiFi read evidence using the Integrated Genomics Viewer (IGV)93, as well as bespoke plots of HiFi CIGAR operations, at each locus to determine whether the candidate de novo TR alleles seemed plausible.

We attempted to obtain putative de novo SVs from three different sources. The first one is based on reporting de novo SVs from read-based callsets (PBSV (v.2.9.0), Sniffles94 (v.0.12.0), Sawfish95 (v.2.2)). The second reports putative de novo SVs from variants called in phased genome assemblies. The last used pangenome graphs constructed from phased genome assemblies to report de novo SVs.

SVPOP8 (v.3.4.0) (https://github.com/EichlerLab/svpop) was used to produce a merged PAV callset across all samples. It merges a single source (single SV caller) across multiple samples. The merge definition used was: nr::ro:szro:exact:match. The samples were provided in this order (G1–G2–G3): NA12889, NA12890, NA12891, NA12892, NA12877, NA12878, NA12879, NA12881, NA12882, NA12883, NA12884, NA12885, NA12886, NA12887.

For each sample in G3, we selected variants unique to that sample alone.

To compare variant calls against the previous generation, SVPOP was used again to do a PBSV/PAV intersection. This involved intersecting the PAV calls for G3 with the PBSV calls for G2, comparing each sample in G3 against each sample in G2.

The callable BED files from PAV, intersections with G2's PBSV calls, and the list of putative de novo calls went into our validation pipeline.

The pipeline (1) checks if the putative de novo variant was called by PBSV in either parent. (2) Checks if the putative de novo variant is seen in HiFi reads in either parent by running subseq (https://github.com/EichlerLab/subseq). (3) Checks if the variant was in a callable region in either parent. (4) Performs an MSA using DECIPHER of the two haplotypes of the sample, and both parents, in the location of the SV with 1,000 bp flank on either side.

Verkko assemblies were partitioned by chromosome by mapping them against the GRCh38, T2T-CHM13 and HG002 (v.1.0.1) human reference genomes using WFMASH (v.0.13.1-251f4e1) pangenome aligner. On each set of contigs, we applied PGGB (v0.6.0-87510bc) to build chromosome-level unbiased pangenome variation graphs96 with the following parameters: -s 20k -p 95 -k 47 -V chm13:100000, grch38:100000. We used the Variation graph toolkit97 (v.1.40.0) to call variants from the graphs with respect to both the T2T-CHM13 and GRCh38 reference genomes. Variants were then decomposed by applying VCFBUB (v.0.1.0-26a1f0c) to retain those found in top-level bubbles that are anchored on the genome used as reference, and VCFWAVE (v.1.0.3) to homogenize SV representation across samples. Subsequently, raw VCF files were used as an input for pedigree-based filtering of putative de novo SVs.

Filtering of de novo SVs was done using BCFtools (v.1.17) +fill-tags followed by filtering the joint-called VCF for singleton-derived alleles at sites where all samples had a genotype call. By considering all G2/G3 family members (not just trios), we increased de novo SV specificity. We used the command line:

bcftools view -i 'INFO/AC = 1' {VCF FILE} | bcftools +fill-tags -- -t 'all,F_MISSING' | bcftools view -i 'F_MISSING = 0.0' --max-alleles 2 | bcftools view --samples {SAMPLE} | bcftools +fill-tags | bcftools view -i 'INFO/AC = 1' | bcftools view -i '(ILEN < -49 || ILEN > 49)' | bcftools view -i 'QUAL > 49' | vcf2tsv

All candidate de novo SVs collected across all regions of the genomes were further evaluated using phased genome assemblies and long-read alignments. Further details are provided in Supplementary Note 10.

We first extracted an inserted SVA element in the de novo Verkko assembly of NA12887 (maternal haplotype, haplotype 1). Next, we used minimap2 (ref. 80) (v.2.24) to align this ~3.4-kb-long piece of DNA to both maternal and paternal Verkko assemblies using the parameters reported below:


minimap2 -x asm20 -c --eqx --secondary=yes {assembly.fasta} {sva.fasta} > {output.paf}


With these parameters we reported all locations of this DNA segment. We defined a putative donor site as an alignment position in maternal haplotype that has nearly perfect match with SVA de novo insertion.

To identify completely and accurately assembled centromeres from each genome assembly, we first aligned the genome assemblies generated via Verkko16 or hifiasm (UL)17 to the T2T-CHM13 reference genome1 using minimap2 (ref. 80) and the following parameters: -a --eqx -x asm20 -s 5000 -I 10G -t {threads}. We then filtered the whole-genome alignments to only those contigs that aligned to the centromeres in the T2T-CHM13 reference genome. We checked whether these centromeric contigs spanned the centromeres by checking to see whether they contained sequence from the p- and the q-arms in the regions directly adjacent to the centromere. We then validated the assembly of the centromeric regions by aligning native PacBio HiFi data from the same source genome to each whole-genome assembly using pbmm2 (v.1.1.0; https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbmm2) and the following command: align --log-level DEBUG --preset SUBREAD --min-length 5000 -j {threads}, and next assessed the assemblies for uniform read depth across the centromeric regions via NucFreq77 (v.0.1). We also aligned native ONT data >30 kb in length from the same source genome to each whole-genome assembly using minimap2 (v.2.28) and assessed the assemblies for uniform read depth across the centromeric regions using IGV browser93.

To identify de novo SVs and SNVs within each centromeric region, we first aligned each child's genome assembly to the relevant parent's genome assembly using minimap2 and the following parameters: -a --eqx -x asm20 -s 5000 -I 10G -t {threads}. We then used the resulting PAF file to identify de novo SVs and SNVs using SVbyEye85 (v.0.99.0), filtering our results to only those centromeres that were completely and accurately assembled. We checked each SV and SNV call with NucFreq, Flagger9 and native ONT data to ensure that the underlying data supported each call. Further details are provided in Supplementary Notes 9 and 10.

We processed all G1, G2 and G3 assemblies with Tandem Repeats Finder (TRF)91 to determine the existence of the canonical telomeric repeat (p-arm, CCCTAA; q-arm, TTAGGG) within the distal regions of each assembled contig; TRF (v.4.09.1) was run with parameters: '2 7 7 80 10 50 10 -d -h-ngs', recommended for young (in this context, non-deteriorated) repeats as implemented in RepeatMasker (v.4.1.6). The assembled contigs, in turn, were aligned to the T2T-CHM13 reference with minimap2 (ref. 80) (v.2.24) using the asm20 preset to establish the identities of each sequence (that is, whether a given contig represented the whole reference chromosome or a part of it, and whether it should be reverse-complemented to represent it canonically). With identities established, TRF annotations were crawled from the outside in (from the 5′ end on p-arms and from the 3′ end on q-arms, with respect to reverse complementarity as reported by minimap2) until the canonical repeat was encountered; incidences of non-canonical interspersed repeats were also retained.

Moreover, PacBio HiFi reads were mapped to the contigs to assess by how many HiFi reads each region of each assembly was supported (coverage depth); distal regions supported by fewer than five HiFi reads were masked. Of the non-acrocentric chromosome ends across all G1, G2 and G3 samples, 74.2% of the Verkko assemblies (893 out of the possible 1,204 across all participants and haplotypes) were found to terminate in a canonical telomeric repeat (either spanning from the very start or end of the contig, or immediately adjacent to the region masked due to low coverage) with the median length of such repeats being 5,608 bp (Supplementary Table 3). Moreover, out of the T2T-CHM13 chromosomes for which both p and q telomeric ends were recovered, 64.6% (221 out of 342) were represented each by a single assembled contig spanning from the p telomere to the q telomere.

The G4 hifiasm assemblies were processed in the same fashion; however, only 56.8% of the telomeric regions (342 out of the possible 602) were recovered (Supplementary Fig. 3) with a median length of the canonical repeat being 4,674 bp (Supplementary Table 3; same as for G1–G3), and the contiguity was markedly worse: only one chromosome (chromosome 9 in haplotype 1 of individual G4-200101) was verifiably spanned by a single contig (h1tg000017l).

To determine the CpG methylation status of each centromere, we first base called raw ONT data with Guppy (https://community.nanoporetech.com; v.6.5.7) using the sup-prom model and the dna_r9.4.1_450bps_modbases_5hmc_5mc_cg_sup_prom.cfg config file. Next, we aligned the ONT data from each sample to the respective genome assembly using minimap2 (ref. 80) (v.2.28) with the following parameters: -ax lr:hq -y -t 4 -I 8 g. We converted the resulting BAM file to a bedMethyl file using modbam2bed (https://github.com/epi2me-labs/modbam2bed) and the following parameters: -e -m 5mC --cpg -t {threads} {input.bam} > {output.bed}. Next, we converted the bedMethyl file into a bedGraph using the following command: awk ‘BEGIN {OFS=“\t”}; {print $1, $2, $3, $11}' {input.bed} | grep -v “nan” | sort -k1,1 -k2,2n > {output.bedgraph} and subsequently converted the bedGraph into a bigwig using bedGraphToBigWig (https://www.encodeproject.org/software/bedgraphtobigwig/) and then visualized the bigwig file using Integrative Genomics Viewer93,98 (v.2.16.0). To determine the size of a hypomethylated region (termed the CDR2,39) in each centromere, we used CDR-Finder (https://github.com/arozanski97/CDR-Finder), which first bins the bedGraph into 5 kb windows, computes the median CpG methylation frequency within windows containing α-satellite (as determined by RepeatMasker99 (v.4.1.0)), selects bins that have a lower CpG methylation frequency than the median frequency in the region, merges consecutive bins into a larger bin, filters for merged bins >50 kb and reports the location of these bins.

The construction and dating of Y-chromosomal phylogeny for 58 total samples, combining the 14 pedigree males from the current study with 44 individuals, for which long-read-based Y assemblies have previously been published, was done as described previously in detail52. In brief, all sites were called from the Illumina high-coverage data14 of the 14 pedigree males using the approximately 10.4 Mb of Y-chromosomal sequence previously defined as accessible to SRS100. BCFtools101,102 (v.1.16) was used with a minimum base quality 20, mapping quality 20 and ploidy 1. SNVs within 5 bp of an indel call (SnpGap) and all indels were removed, followed by filtering all calls for a minimum read depth of 3 and a requirement of ≥85% of reads covering the position to support the called genotype. The VCF was merged with a similarly filtered VCF from ref. 52 for the 44 individuals using BCFtools, and then sites with ≥5% of missing calls, that is, missing in more than 3 out of 58 samples, were removed using VCFtools103 (v.0.1.16). After filtering, a total of 10,404,104 sites remained, including 13,443 variant sites.

The Y haplogroups of each sample were predicted as previously described104 and correspond to the International Society of Genetic Genealogy nomenclature (ISOGG; https://isogg.org; v.15.73). A coalescence-based method implemented in BEAST105 (v.1.10.4) was used to estimate the ages of internal nodes. RAxML106 (v.8.2.10) with the GTRGAMMA substitution model was used to construct a starting maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree for BEAST. Markov-chain Monte Carlo samples were based on 200 million iterations, logging every 1,000 iterations, with the first 10% of iterations discarded as a burn-in. A constant-sized coalescent tree prior, the GTR substitution model, accounting for site heterogeneity (gamma), and a strict clock with a normal distribution based on the 95% CI of the substitution rate (0.76 × 10−9 (95% CI = 0.67 × 10−9–0.86 × 10−9) single-nucleotide mutations per base pair per year) was used107. A summary tree was produced using Tree-Annotator (v.1.10.4) and visualized using the FigTree software (v.1.4.4).

Detailed analysis of Y-chromosomal DNMs focused on seven male individuals (R1b1a-Z302 Y haplogroup, G1-NA12889, G2-NA12877, G3-NA12882, G3-NA12883, G3-NA12884 and G3-NA12886) for whom phased Verkko assemblies were generated. Contigs containing X- and Y-chromosomal sequences were identified and extracted from the whole-genome assemblies as previously described52. Moreover, the pseudoautosomal regions from the G1 grandmother NA12890 and G2 mother NA12878 genome assemblies were identified by aligning the respective sequences from the T2T-CHM13 reference genome to these assemblies using minimap2 (ref. 80) (v.2.26).

The annotation of Y-chromosomal subregions of the Verkko assemblies was performed using both the GRCh38 and T2T-CHM13 Y reference sequences as previously described52. The centromeric α-satellite repeats for the purpose of Y subregion annotation were identified using RepeatMasker99 (v.4.1.2-p1) with the default parameters. The Yq12 repeat annotations were generated using HMMER108 (v.3.3.2dev) with published DYZ1, DYZ2, DYZ18, 2k7bp and 3k1bp sequences52, followed by manual checking of repeat unit orientation and distance from each other. Dot plots to compare Y-chromosomal sequences were generated using Gepard109 (v.2.0).

Human Y chromosomes vary extensively in the size and composition of repetitive regions52, including the T2T-CHM13 Y (haplogroup J1a-L816) and the R1b1a-Z302 haplogroup Y chromosomes carried by the seven pedigree males (Supplementary Note 6). For this reason, the Y assembly of the G1 grandfather NA12889 was used as a reference for DNM detection. The DNMs were called from the Y assemblies of five G2 (NA12877) and G3 (NA12882, NA12883, NA12884 and NA12886) males using Dipcall82 (v.0.3) with the default parameters recommended for male samples. Variants were identified from the MSY only, that is, the pseudoautosomal regions were excluded from this analysis. All identified variants were filtered as follows: any variant calls overlapping with regions flagged by Flagger or NucFreq in either reference or query assembly were filtered out.

For SNVs, the final filtered calls were supported by 100% of HiFi reads (that is, no reads supported the reference allele in offspring or alternative allele in the father) and ONT reads mapped to both the reference and each individual assembly were checked for support.

For indels (≤50 bp), homopolymer tracts were excluded from the analysis, while the rest of the calls were validated using the read data (HiFi, ONT, Illumina) as follows. Individual reads mapped to the reference (G1 NA12889 Y assembly) and covering the indel call plus 150 bp of flanking sequence were extracted from all samples using subseq (https://github.com/EichlerLab/subseq), followed by alignment using MAFFT110,111 (v.7.508) with the default parameters. All alignments were manually checked and any calls where the HiFi data had two or more reads supporting a reference allele and one or more reads supporting an alternative allele were removed. All final SNV and indel calls were additionally supported (if unique mapping to the region was possible) by both Illumina and Element read data mapped to the reference.

For all SV calls, HiFi read depth for reference and alternative alleles were visualized and SVs in regions showing high levels of read depth variation coinciding with clusters of SNVs with >10% of reads supporting an alternative allele removed. HiFi and ONT reads mapped to both the reference and individual assemblies were checked for support.

For all variants, concordance with the expected transmission through generations was confirmed. Moreover, the HiFi data available for three G4 male individuals (200101, 200102 and 200105) were checked for support of the identified variants.

The assembly-based DNM rates were calculated for each of the five male individuals based on the accessible regions of each individual Y assembly (that is, any regions flagged by Flagger and/or NucFreq were removed).

Mobile element analysis was performed on PacBio HiFi reads using xTea112 (v.0.1.9). Potential non-reference mobile element insertions (MEI) identified with xTea were visualized using IGV to ensure that the insertions were identifiable in the sequencing reads and to determine whether any of these events were de novo. Using BEDTools113, we intersected the non-reference insertions with introns, exons, 5′-UTRs and 3′-UTRs from T2T-CHM13. To identify potential source elements of the non-reference LINE-1 insertions, we used BLAT114 to find the best matching insertion in the T2T-CHM13 reference genome. If there were multiple matches in the reference genome that had the same score, a source element was not called. MEI sequences representing known Alu, L1 and SVA subclasses were obtained from previous work115, Dfam116 and UCSC Genome Browser74. Reference and novel sequences for each MEI class were combined into class-specific files. Sequences were oriented to plus-strand. Highly truncated sequences were removed. MEI sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE117 (v.3.8.31) aligner. Pairwise distances among MEI sequences were calculated using a Kimera two-parameter method and then converted to correlations. Principal components were obtained by eigenvalue decomposition of the pairwise correlation matrix. The first three principal components were plotted to visualize the relationships among the non-reference MEIs and the known MEI subfamily sequences.

a) Scatterplot of sequence read depth and read length N50 for ONT (blue) and PacBio (PB; magenta) with median coverage (dashed line) and different generations indicated (point shape). b) Scatterplot of the assembly contiguity measured in AuN values for Verkko (brown), hifiasm (UL) (light blue), and hifiasm (light grey) assemblies of G1-G4. Note: G4 samples were assembled using PacBio HiFi data (hifiasm) only; hifiasm (UL) refers to hifiasm assemblies integrating both PacBio HiFi and ONT data. c) Top: Total number of Verkko contigs whose maximum aligned bases are within +/−5% of the total T2T-CHM13 chromosome length. *Due to substantial size differences between the T2T-CHM13 Y (haplogroup J1a-L816) and the Y chromosome of this pedigree (haplogroup R1b1a-Z302), three contigs are shown that span the entire male-specific Y region without breaks (i.e., excluding the pseudoautosomal regions). Bottom: Each dot represents a single Verkko contig with the highest number of aligned bases in a given chromosome. d) Chromosomes containing complete telomeres and being spanned by a single contig are annotated as solid squares. In instances where the p- and q-arms are not continuously assembled and for acrocentric chromosomes, we plot diagonally divided and colour-coded triangles. e) Evaluation of centromere completeness across G1-G3 assemblies and across all chromosomes. We mark centromeres assembled by Verkko (brown), hifiasm (UL) (light blue), or both (green).

a) Depiction of intergenerational (G1- > G4) inheritance of a 1 Mbp assembled contig. Alignments transmitted between generations that are >99.99% identical (red) are contrasted with non-transmitted with lower sequence identity (grey). b) T2T recombination between child and parental haplotypes for Chromosome 8. Alignments between the parental and child haplotypes are binned into 500 kbp long bins and coloured based on the percentage of matched bases. Inherited maternal (shades of red) and paternal (shades of blue) segments are marked on top. Dashed arrows show zoom-in of the two recombination breakpoints that differ in size of the region of homology at the recombination breakpoint. Black tick marks show positions of mismatches between parental and child haplotypes. c) Distribution of distances of maternal (red) and paternal (blue) recombination breakpoints (G2-G4) to chromosome ends with respect to T2T-CHM13 (histogram bin size: 50). d) Significant association between the number of recombination breaks (y-axis) and parental age (x-axis) shown separately for maternal (red) and paternal (blue) recombination breakpoints (G2-G3) detected with respect to T2T-CHM13. Regression lines were fitted using Poisson GLM with a log link (p = 2.02 × 10−3, 7.88 × 10−4 for parental age and sex effects, respectively).

a) The fraction of a parent's germline SNVs (green, DNMs) and postzygotic SNVs (purple, PZMs) transferred to each child. b) The mean allele balance (AB) of DNMs (n = 249) and PZMs (n = 55) across HiFi, Illumina, and ONT data plotted against the fraction of children who inherited a variant are significantly correlated for DNMs (two-sided t-test, p = 0.0084) and PZMs (p = 0.00021). Half of PZMs with AB < 0.25 are transmitted to at least one child (n = 18/36). c) On average, DNMs are transmitted to 50% of children, while PZMs are transmitted to less than 25% of children. Boxes represent IQR including median line; whiskers extend to 25%  −  1.5 × IQR and 75%  +  1.5 × IQR, outliers are shown as dots. d) Number of DNMs and PZMs transmitted to each child in the pedigree.

a) Schematic of the generalized organization of human centromeres and their flanking sequence. Major components and their structures are shown. HOR, higher-order repeat. Not drawn to scale. b) Deletion of an 18-monomer α-satellite HOR within the Chromosome 6 centromere of G2-NA12878 is inherited in G3-NA12887, shortening the length of the α-satellite HOR array by ~3 kbp. c) Sequence identity heatmap of the Chromosome 6 centromere in G1-NA128991 shows the high (~100%) sequence identity of α-satellite HORs along the entire centromeric array and at the site of the de novo deletion. d,e) Deletions of α-satellite HORs in regions outside of the centromere dip region (CDR) in the d) Chromosome 4 and e) Chromosome 11 centromeres does not affect the position of the CDR. f,g) Deletions and insertions of α-satellite HORs within the CDR in the f) Chromosome 19 and g) Chromosome 21 centromeres alter the distribution of the CDR.

Metrics details

Metamaterials with multimodal deformation mechanisms resemble machines1,2, especially when endowed with autonomous functionality. A representative architected assembly, with tunable chirality, converts linear motion into rotation3. These chiral metamaterials with a machine-like dual modality have potential use in areas such as wave manipulation4, optical activity related to circular polarization5 and chiral active fluids6. However, the dual motions are essentially coupled and cannot be independently controlled. Moreover, they are restricted to small deformation, that is, strain ≤2%, which limits their applications. Here we establish modular chiral metamaterials, consisting of auxetic planar tessellations and origami-inspired columnar arrays, with decoupled actuation. Under single-degree-of-freedom actuation, the assembly twists between 0° and 90°, contracts in-plane up to 25% and shrinks out-of-plane more than 50%. Using experiments and simulations, we show that the deformation of the assembly involves in-plane twist and contraction dominated by the rotating-square tessellations and out-of-plane shrinkage dominated by the tubular Kresling origami arrays. Moreover, we demonstrate two distinct actuation conditions: twist with free translation and linear displacement with free rotation. Our metamaterial is built on a highly modular assembly, which enables reprogrammable instability, local chirality control, tunable loading capacity and scalability. Our concept provides routes towards multimodal, multistable and reprogrammable machines, with applications in robotic transformers, thermoregulation, mechanical memories in hysteresis loops, non-commutative state transition and plug-and-play functional assemblies for energy absorption and information encryption.

Source data

a, Experimental setup consisting of a dc power source, a scalable power converter, and a set of copper coils. b, Modular power converter prototype comprising six individual power electronic building blocks. c, 3-D Helmholtz coil structure made of six circular-winding pairs; each pair consists of two windings connected in series. d, Scalable power-converter topology consisting of six full-bridge submodules to precisely control the current of each winding pair. e, System block diagram showing the closed loop current-control scheme; the winding currents are sensed locally in each submodule using shunt resistors. A proportional-integral controller is implemented on a microcontroller card resulting in an equivalent first order reference-to-winding current system. Each coil is modeled by an inductance value L and a resistance R representing the resistivity of the copper wire. The controller gains are selected as \({k}_{p}=L/{t}_{r}ln9\) and \({k}_{i}=R/{t}_{r}ln9\) to accomplish a 10% to 90% current rise time of tr = 1.5 ms. A pulse width modulator (PWM) employing a 10 kHz triangular carrier wave is used to generate the signals controlling the states of the individual power switches.

Metrics details

Environmental thermal challenges trigger the brain to coordinate both autonomic and behavioural responses to maintain optimal body temperature1,2,3,4. It is unknown how temperature information is precisely stored and retrieved in the brain and how it is converted into a physiological response. Here we investigated whether memories could control whole-body metabolism by training mice to remember a thermal challenge. Mice were conditioned to associate a context with a specific temperature by combining thermoregulatory Pavlovian conditioning with engram-labelling technology, optogenetics and chemogenetics. We report that if mice are returned to an environment in which they previously experienced a 4 °C cold challenge, they increase their metabolic rates regardless of the actual environmental temperature. Furthermore, we show that mice have increased hypothalamic activity when they are exposed to the cold, and that a specific network emerges between the hippocampus and the hypothalamus during the recall of a cold memory. Both natural retrieval and artificial reactivation of cold-sensitive memory engrams in the hippocampus mimic the physiological responses that are seen during a cold challenge. These ensembles are necessary for cold-memory retrieval. These findings show that retrieval of a cold memory causes whole-body autonomic and behavioural responses that enable mice to maintain thermal homeostasis.

The brain and the body are intrinsically connected and interact bidirectionally to maintain homeostasis5. Although brain–body interactions are now a central topic in neuroscience, only recently have studies shown that mental states can directly influence bodily function and that associative learning processes can modify peripheral immune and neuroendocrine responses6,7,8,9,10. However, to our knowledge, a direct link between the memory of an experience and immediate physiological changes in the body for host adaptability has yet to be identified. Here we investigated whether memories can control whole-body metabolism by training mice to remember a cold experience.

When faced with an environmental thermal challenge, birds and mammals actively maintain their body temperature in a narrow range to preserve critical cellular functions2. To achieve this, the brain triggers several thermoregulatory behavioural responses that maintain homeostatic body temperature—including motivated goal-directed behavioural responses such as moving to a warm place, nest building and postural changes—as well as autonomic physiological mechanisms, such as shivering, vasoconstriction and non-shivering thermogenesis1. The neurally regulated metabolic process of non-shivering thermogenesis contributes to the production of heat and the maintenance of core body temperature and is largely influenced by altered metabolism in brown adipose tissue (BAT)11.

Many brain regions and neural pathways have been implicated in real-time thermoregulation, including the lateral hypothalamus (LHA), the medial preoptic area (MPO) and the xiphoid nucleus3,4,12,13. However, it is currently unclear whether temperature information can be stored in the brain in the form of memories. Such learned information could enable animals to anticipate thermal challenges on the basis of previous experience and allow them to respond in an energy-efficient manner. This would also require the storage, retrieval and conversion of temperature information into physiological responses. Here we investigate whether temperature information can be stored in the brain in the form of temperature-sensitive memory engrams.

The enduring physical change in the brain that accounts for a specific memory can be referred to as an engram14. Engram cells can be operationally defined as neuronal ensembles that are activated by learning and undergo physical changes, and the reactivation of which leads to the retrieval of the target memory15,16,17,18. Previous studies have identified memory engrams by combining methods that tag immediate early genes (such as Fos and Arc) with optogenetics and chemogenetics17,19,20. By using engram-labelling technology, we investigated how temperature information is stored in the mouse brain.

We show that mice can be conditioned to associate a particular context with a cold temperature experience. A Pavlovian conditioned thermoregulatory response can thereafter be elicited by exposure to contextual stimuli associated with cold experiences. We also find that hypothalamic activity is highly upregulated when mice are exposed to the cold, and that a specific network emerges between the hippocampus and the hypothalamus during the recall of a cold memory. We show that cold-sensitive memory engrams form in the hippocampus and specific regions of the hypothalamus, and that both natural retrieval and artificial reactivation of these engrams mediate the physiological responses that are seen during a cold challenge. Furthermore, these ensembles are necessary for the retrieval of a cold memory. These results highlight that cold-sensitive engrams control whole-body autonomic and behavioural responses that enable mice to maintain thermal homeostasis.

To investigate whether mice can store and retrieve temperature information, we designed a thermoregulatory Pavlovian conditioning experiment in which mice were trained in context A at 21 °C and in context B at 4 °C (Fig. 1a,b). Cold exposure stimulates thermogenesis by increasing lipid and glucose metabolism in BAT, which in turn upregulates whole-body metabolic rate21,22,23. Mice exposed to a 4 °C environment had a lower core body temperature than when they were exposed to a 21 °C environment (Extended Data Fig. 1a–f) and showed increased oxygen consumption (Extended Data Fig. 2a), energy expenditure (Extended Data Fig. 2b) and carbon dioxide production (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Mice also moved significantly more in the 4 °C environment than in the 21 °C environment (Extended Data Fig. 2d). No differences in food consumption were observed (Extended Data Fig. 2e). We also found that the observed increase in metabolic rate and energy expenditure persisted across all three cold training days (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). Together, these data show that mice increase their metabolic rate and alter their behaviour in response to a cold environment.

To establish whether mice can associate a specific context with a given temperature, we trained mice at 4 °C in context B and subsequently tested them in that same context at 21 °C. We observed an increase in metabolic rate when mice were returned to the cold-paired context, irrespective of the actual temperature of that context (Fig. 1c–g and Extended Data Figs. 3a,b and 4a–e). This effect was specifically induced by the contextual cues associated with cold training and not just exposure to a neutral context at baseline day 2 (BL2; Extended Data Figs. 2a–e and 4f–m). When mice were returned to the cold-paired context on test day 1 (T1), they increased their core body temperature compared with baseline day 1 (BL1; Extended Data Fig. 1b–j). Furthermore, mice showed significantly increased movement when returned to the cold-paired context (Extended Data Fig. 3c), but no difference in food consumption compared with BL1 (Extended Data Fig. 3d), suggesting that mice can adjust their behaviour in the cold-paired context on T1, similar to what is observed in the 4 °C context. Although differences in movement were found between various days, the observed increase in metabolic rate on test day was not driven solely by movement (Extended Data Fig. 4n–q). Notably, we also found a temporal dynamic on T1, as the metabolic rates resemble cold day 1 (CL1) during the first few hours and come closer to baseline levels after 6 h (Fig. 1c–g). Both male and female mice increased their metabolic rate when they were returned to the cold-paired context (Extended Data Figs. 4f–m and 5a–c).

To confirm that the upregulation of the metabolic rate on test day was due to the pairing of 4 °C and context B, and not because of the novelty of the context, we trained mice in the same Pavlovian timeline without changing the temperature from 21 °C (Fig. 1h,i). We found that, although the novelty of context B caused an increase in metabolic rate in the initial 2 h of the no-cold training and test days, there were no differences in metabolic rate between baseline, no-cold training and test after 2 h (Fig. 1j), suggesting that novelty does not affect metabolic rate after 2 h. Mice that underwent 4 °C cold training in context B were directly compared with mice that underwent the 21 °C no-cold training in context B. Our results demonstrate that cold training at 4 °C in context B significantly increased metabolic rate on T1 compared with 21 °C no-cold training (Fig. 1k). These effects are not due to initial differences between the two groups, as they did not significantly differ in metabolic rate on BL1 (Fig. 1l).

These data show that the increase in metabolic rate is not caused by the novelty of context B, but rather by the association of 4 °C with context B. To rule out the possibility that the increase in metabolic rate was due to the prolonged effects of long-term cold exposure, a separate cohort of mice was allowed to recover in their home cage for four consecutive days instead of two after cold training (Extended Data Fig. 6a–g). We found that the increase in metabolic rate persisted even after this longer recovery break, indicating that the observed increase in whole-body metabolism was not due to prolonged cold effects, but rather to the recall of the cold-paired contextual memory. To rule out the possibility that the increase in metabolic rate was due to a generalized stress response, mice were exposed to the predator odour trimethylthiazoline (TMT) while we simultaneously recorded metabolic rates. We observed no increase in metabolic rate in mice that were exposed to TMT, compared with mice that were exposed to a control odour (Extended Data Fig. 6h,i). These data suggest that the increase in metabolic rate on T1 was due not to a general stress response but specifically to the recall of a cold memory.

Finally, to demonstrate the behavioural expression of a cold memory, we analysed whether mice develop a conditioned cold aversion due to training at 4 °C in a conditioned place preference apparatus (Extended Data Fig. 6j). Mice have no preference for either side of the apparatus on the day before the test at 21 °C (Extended Data Fig. 6k); however, mice trained at 4 °C displayed a conditioned place aversion to the cold-paired side of the conditioned place preference apparatus but not to the 21 °C paired side (Extended Data Fig. 6l). These data demonstrate that mice can form a contextual memory of a cold environment that, after retrieval, leads to an increase in whole-body metabolism and avoidance behaviour.

BAT is a specialized tissue that is important for non-shivering thermogenesis in both humans and rodents24. The lipolysis metabolic pathway has been demonstrated to fuel the thermogenic response in brown adipocytes through uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1)25 (Fig. 1m). To further establish the relationship between cold memory and whole-body metabolic responses, we collected BAT from mice at different time points (Fig. 1m). In line with previous studies, we showed that after cold exposure, multiple thermogenic genes are upregulated, including Ucp1 (Extended Data Fig. 7b–g). Notably, we found that several thermogenic genes are also upregulated in mice during cold recall on T1, compared with control mice on BL2 (Fig. 1n–s). We observed an upregulation of Ucp1 (Fig. 1n), in addition to an increase in mitochondrial genes involved in fatty acid uptake, such as Cpt1a (which encodes CPT1α) and Cact (Fig. 1o,p) and genes associated with fatty acid release from lipid droplets, such as Atgl and Hsl (Fig. 1q,r). These results indicate that recall of a cold memory is sufficient to upregulate thermogenic genes in BAT.

We tested whether the observed upregulation of thermogenesis genes was specifically due to cold experiences or due to a generalized stress response. We collected BAT from mice that underwent contextual fear conditioning training and compared them with mice that received no foot shocks (Extended Data Fig. 7h). We observed no differences in any of the examined thermogenesis genes between mice that received foot shocks and controls that did not (Extended Data Fig. 7i–n). Next, we collected BAT from mice that were exposed to a predator odour (TMT) or to a neutral control odour (H2O, Extended Data Fig. 7o). We found no increase in thermogenic gene expression in mice exposed to TMT compared with mice that were exposed to H2O (Extended Data Fig. 7p–u). However, we found significantly decreased expression of Hsl in TMT-exposed mice compared with H2O-exposed controls (Extended Data Fig. 7t). Together, these experiments showed that thermogenesis genes in BAT are not upregulated as a result of a stressful experience in general, but that this increase is due to a cold experience specifically. We therefore conclude that cold memories can control whole-body thermoregulatory responses.

To identify the neuronal activity patterns that underlie cold memory encoding and retrieval, we examined FOS expression throughout multiple brain regions. We compared FOS activity during BL1, CL1 and T1, to determine which regions were active during specific conditions (Fig. 2a). To enable automated FOS detection in various hippocampal and hypothalamic regions, all brains were run through an automated brain-wide counting pipeline (Fig. 2b,c). Our results showed no differences in the number of FOS+ cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) between any of the three examined conditions (Fig. 2d). However, cold-activated FOS activity was found in the CA3 and CA1 subregions of the hippocampus at CL1 and T1, compared with BL1, suggesting that CA3 and CA1 are important areas that are involved in cold responses (Fig. 2e,f). Although no innate differences in FOS activity were found in the DG between the three conditions, we hypothesized that there may be differences in how this region interacts with whole-body metabolism after learning. As such, we correlated FOS activity in the DG with oxygen consumption at BL1, CL1 and T1 (Fig. 2g). Our results showed that at BL1, there was no correlation between FOS activity in the DG and metabolic rate. At CL1, there was a negative correlation between oxygen consumption and DG activity. However, at T1, after the cold memory has been consolidated, there was a significant positive correlation between oxygen consumption and DG activity (Fig. 2g). A similar correlation pattern was observed in CA1 but not in CA3 (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). We conclude that various subregions of the hippocampus are involved in the encoding or retrieval of contextual cold memories and that the DG and CA1 play a part in regulating whole-body metabolism at T1.

Previous studies have identified the LHA, MPO and lateral preoptic area (LPO) as key brain regions involved in thermoregulation26. We therefore compared FOS activity in these regions at BL1, CL1 and T1. In line with previous studies, we showed that FOS activity in the LHA is upregulated when mice are exposed to the cold during CL1 (Fig. 2h). Notably, we found similar levels of activity in this area when mice are recalling the cold on T1. Although we also see increased activity in the MPO and LPO during cold exposure (Fig. 2i,j), we found no increases in FOS activity in these areas on T1. Moreover, no increases in FOS activity were found at CL1 or T1 in any of the other investigated hypothalamic areas (Extended Data Fig. 8h–k). Next, we tested whether activity in the LHA, MPO and LPO correlated with metabolic rate. We found that only the mice that were exposed to the cold on CL1 show a positive correlative trend between FOS activity in the LHA and oxygen consumption (Fig. 2k). This trend was not found in any other condition or hypothalamic region (Extended Data Fig. 8c,d). These findings suggest that the LHA is important during encoding and recall of cold and that LHA activity correlates with metabolic rate during a cold experience.

Finally, to confirm that the increases in FOS activity found during CL1 and T1 were specifically due to cold exposure and recall rather than because of stress, mice were trained in a fear conditioning experiment (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Mice that underwent contextual fear conditioning training did not show similar increases in FOS activity in hippocampal or hypothalamic regions to those observed in the cold (Extended Data Fig. 9c–j). Furthermore, increased FOS activity was observed in amygdalar regions after fear conditioning, but not during the cold or cold recall (Extended Data Figs. 8m–o and 9l–n). These data suggest that stress was not the cause of the neural activity found in the hippocampus and hypothalamus.

To understand how functional connectivity between brain regions is altered during cold exposure and cold-memory retrieval, we performed further correlational analyses of FOS activity across brain regions (Extended Data Fig. 8r–t). From this, we built correlational networks that corresponded to BL1, CL1 and T1 to further visualize plasticity of functional connectivity (Fig. 2l–n). We found that, compared with the baseline network, there is increased functional connectivity between hypothalamic regions when mice are exposed to the cold (Fig. 2l,m). Moreover, we found an increase in functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the hypothalamus when mice are recalling the cold, compared with when they are experiencing the cold, which is not observed in the baseline network (Fig. 2l–n). These data suggest that hippocampus-to-hypothalamus connectivity is a plasticity feature that forms after a cold contextual memory is encoded in mice.

Engram ensembles have been identified in many areas of the brain, such as the hippocampus, amygdala and prefrontal cortex, for various sensory modalities19,27,28,29,30,31,32. To better understand how cold memories are encoded and retrieved, we crossed Trap2 mice with R26R-STOP-floxed enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) transgenic mice to achieve optimal labelling in the DG, LHA, MPO and LPO19,33,34 (Fig. 3a).

To quantify activated engram cells in multiple brain regions, mice were put through a cold-engram-labelling protocol (Fig. 3b). The number of eYFP+ cells was first quantified in the DG, LHA, MPO and LPO (Fig. 3c). Our findings show no differences in the number of eYFP+ cells in the DG, LHA, MPO or LPO between mice recalling a contextual cold memory at T1 and home-cage controls, suggesting comparable amounts of labelled cells in both groups (Fig. 3d–g). Next, we quantified the number of FOS+ cells between the groups (Fig. 3h–l). There was a significant increase in the number of FOS+ cells in mice retrieving the cold memory in the LHA (Fig. 3j), whereas no significant differences were found in the DG, MPO and LPO (Fig. 3i,k,l). Finally, we measured engram reactivation by quantifying the cells that were active during both encoding and expression of a cold memory (that is, (FOS+eYFP+)/eYFP+; Fig. 3m). Our results show a significant increase in colabelling in the DG, LHA and MPO (Fig. 3n,o,p), but not in the LPO (Fig. 3q), in mice retrieving a cold memory compared with home-cage controls. Together, these data suggest that cold-sensitive memory engrams are located in the DG, LHA and MPO.

We next analysed how increased reactivation of cold-sensitive engrams affected whole-body metabolism. Here we correlated the amount of colabelled cells in the DG with oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production and energy expenditure. We found strong positive correlations between cold-engram cell reactivation in the DG and metabolic rate at T1 and CL1, but not at BL1 (Fig. 3r–t). These results indicate that increased cold engram reactivation during recall covaries with whole-body metabolism during recall, and, crucially, with metabolism during the original training day when the engram was formed. Finally, we performed correlational analyses of engram reactivation activity across brain regions. These analyses revealed a significant positive correlation between activity in the DG and LHA in mice recalling the cold (Fig. 3u), whereas this type of coordinated activity was not found in the home-cage control mice (Fig. 3v). Similarly, we found coordinated activity between the MPO and LPO in test mice but not in controls (Fig. 3u–v). In line with our FOS data, these results indicate that when mice recall the cold, a specific engram pathway emerges between the DG and LHA, in addition to a connection between the MPO and LPO, and that coordinated hypothalamic activity is essential for contextual cold memories.

To determine whether cold-sensitive engrams are functionally relevant for whole-body metabolism, we set out to optogenetically reactivate cold engrams in the DG. To do so, we labelled cold-sensitive engrams in the DG on CL1 and optogenetically reactivated them in a neutral context (Fig. 4a–d and Extended Data Fig. 10a–c). We showed that optogenetic reactivation of cold-sensitive engrams in the DG is sufficient to artificially increase whole-body metabolism (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 11j,l). Moreover, we found that metabolic rates increased when cold-sensitive engrams were stimulated, and that they returned to baseline during the unstimulated period (Fig. 4f–i). Notably, metabolic rate increased only in the first two consecutive stimulations, but not during a third stimulation, suggesting an attenuation of whole-body responses or a limitation of optogenetic engram stimulation (Fig. 4h). Furthermore, we demonstrated that optogenetic reactivation of cold-sensitive engrams is possible with multiple transgenic mouse lines and with different engram-labelling strategies, including one based on the FOS-tTa system (Extended Data Fig. 12a–h).

To confirm that the increase in metabolic rate was due to contextual cold memories, we designed a control experiment in which mice were run through the same timeline but were never exposed to the cold (Extended Data Fig. 11a,b). As such, we labelled no-cold engram cells in the DG and optogenetically reactivated them in a neutral context. Our results show that optogenetically stimulating no-cold engram cells does not increase whole-body metabolism (Extended Data Fig. 11c,k,m). There were no significant differences between on and off periods during any of the three stimulations (Extended Data Fig. 11d–g). Notably, a slight decrease in oxygen consumption was found when the laser was on compared with when it was off (Extended Data Fig. 11g). We next directly compared optogenetic stimulation of cold-sensitive engrams with no-cold contextual engrams (Extended Data Fig. 11h). We show that oxygen consumption significantly increased in the cold group compared with the no-cold group during laser stimulation (Extended Data Fig. 11i). The difference in metabolic rate during laser activation was not due to pre-existing differences between the cohorts, as no differences were found between the cold and no-cold groups when the laser was off (Extended Data Fig. 11i). Therefore, we conclude that cold-sensitive engrams control whole-body metabolism, as optogenetic activation of these cells increases metabolic rate.

We investigated whether optogenetic stimulation of cold-sensitive DG engrams would result in increased engram activity in hypothalamic regions. To achieve this, we labelled cold engrams in the DG with channelrhodopsin on CL1, while labelling engrams throughout the brain with eYFP on a background of the Trap2;R26R compound transgenic line. We subsequently quantified artificially reactivated engram cells in the LHA, MPO and LPO (Fig. 4j–l). We show that there was a significant increase in colabelling (that is, (FOS+eYFP+)/eYFP+) in the LHA and MPO after optogenetic stimulation of cold-sensitive DG engrams compared with after stimulation of no-cold engrams (Fig. 4m–o and Extended Data Fig. 12i–r). This increase in colabelling was not found in the LPO (Fig. 4o), suggesting that only specific regions of the hypothalamus have increased engram connectivity with the DG. Notably, we found that the artificially induced engram activity in the LHA significantly correlated with oxygen consumption (Fig. 4p), suggesting that the connectivity found between the DG and specific regions of the hypothalamus mediates the learned control of whole-body metabolism.

Next, we optogenetically reactivated cold-sensitive engrams to artificially induce a thermogenic response and collected BAT to determine whether artificial reactivation of cold memories increases thermogenic gene expression in adipose tissue (Fig. 4q). Our results show that artificial reactivation of a cold-sensitive engram leads to an increase in Ucp1 (Fig. 4r) and Cpt1a (Fig. 4s) expression in BAT compared with the reactivation of no-cold engram cells. No differences were found in other thermogenic genes (Fig. 4t–v). Together, these results show that both natural and artificial retrieval of cold memories causes an upregulation of thermogenesis genes in BAT.

To further explore the role of cold-sensitive engram cells, we chemogenetically inhibited DG cold engrams during cold-memory recall. To do so, we labelled cold-sensitive engrams in the DG of the hippocampus on CL1 with inhibitory DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) hM4Di receptors and chemogenetically inhibited these cells by injecting clozapine-N-oxide (CNO)35 on T1 (Fig. 5a–c and Extended Data Fig. 10d–g). We observed an increase in metabolic rate on T1 compared with BL1 when saline was injected into control mice on T1. This increase in metabolic rate was observed throughout the 2 h and for the combined total testing time (Fig. 5d–g and Extended Data Fig. 13b,c,g,h). By contrast, we found that CNO-treated mice no longer showed the learned increase in metabolic rate on T1 (Fig. 5h). Furthermore, we found that the conditioned response was no longer present at any point throughout the testing time (Fig. 5h–k and Extended Data Fig. 13d,e,i,j). When directly comparing the saline- and CNO-injected mice, we found a significantly higher percentage change in metabolism in the saline-injected mice than in the CNO-injected mice (Fig. 5l–n and Extended Data Fig. 13f,k). Together, these data show that by inhibiting cold-sensitive cells in the DG, we could inhibit contextual cold memories and, as a result, prevent the conditioned whole-body responses that were previously associated with these contextual stimuli.

In this study, we investigated the influence of memory engrams on whole-body responses. We found that mice increase their metabolic rate, core body temperature and adjust their behaviour when recalling a cold environment, indicating that they can store and recall temperature information. Our findings reveal that the recall of a cold environment increases FOS activity in the hippocampus and hypothalamus and that it leads to increased functional connectivity between these two structures. We found that cold-sensitive engram cells are located in the DG, LHA and MPO and that artificial reactivation of DG engram cells leads to an increase in whole-body metabolism and engram cell activity in the hypothalamus. Moreover, our results showed that inhibition of cold-sensitive cells in the DG prevents the conditioned whole-body response that was previously associated with cold memories. Notably, we show that contextual cold memories control whole-body responses in BAT by increasing thermogenic genes during cold recall. Together, these data show that cold-sensitive engrams control whole-body thermoregulatory responses.

Previous studies have demonstrated a direct role for the hypothalamus in regulating body temperature, heart rate and energy expenditure36,37,38,39,40. In this study, we link memories to changes in whole-body metabolism. The increases found here are not solely due to a general stress response to the cold, as we found that exposure to other stressful experiences did not increase metabolic rate or expression of lipolytic and thermogenic genes. Although cold exposure may inevitably cause some stress to the mice, it does not explain the memory outcomes found here. However, it was not possible to completely exclude the possibility of cold being a mild pain or discomfort signal in this study. We found no differences in food consumption during cold exposure or cold memory recall, suggesting that 8 h of cold exposure is not long enough to cause changes in feeding behaviour, which is in line with previously reported results4. Notably, we found that mice increased their movement across training days and when recalling the cold, indicating that previous experience and expectations causes adaptive behavioural responses in mice.

Previous studies investigating the role of the hippocampus after acute heat and cold exposure showed a distinct role of the DG only after acute heat exposure41. In line with this, we found no differences in FOS activity in the DG after cold exposure. However, we found significant increases in neuronal activity in CA3 and CA1, suggesting that both of these areas potentially hold innate cold-sensing cells. Future experiments are needed to determine whether these hippocampal subregions are important for innate cold responses. By comparing the cells that were active during the encoding and recall of a cold memory, we found putative cold-sensitive memory engrams in the DG, LHA and MPO. Previous studies have shown that engram cells are necessary and sufficient to induce the learning-specific conditioned behavioural response, and that neural activity can regulate immune responses10,17,30. Here we describe how engram cells control peripheral physiological processes beyond traditionally studied behavioural responses. Our results show that contextual cold engrams in the DG control whole-body metabolism through engram connectivity in the LHA and MPO. Furthermore, we show that engram connectivity in the hypothalamus resulting from artificial DG stimulation correlates with whole-body metabolism. One question that remains is whether these bodily responses in turn also influence engram cells specifically and memories in general. For example, increasing heart rate by optogenetic activation of cardiac rhythms resulted in enhanced anxiety42. It is therefore highly likely that information flows not only from the brain to the body but also vice versa. Future studies are necessary to determine how bodily states modulate the storage and formation of memories and how this relates to engram cells.

BAT has been found to be a versatile organ that is involved in a variety of metabolic and endocrine processes. Recently, it has also been suggested that BAT might be a stress-responsive organ that is crucial for a fight-or-flight response43,44. Here we show that the genes in the thermogenic pathway analysed in this study are not uniquely activated by stress. Moreover, our results revealed no differences in thermogenic gene expression in fear-conditioned or predator-odour-exposed mice. As such, we found that these genes are specifically involved in thermoregulatory processes that are activated when a mouse is encoding and recalling a cold environment. Together, our data and previously published data seem to suggest that different types of stressor elicit different responses from BAT and that its response is highly dependent on the type of contextual input that it receives.

Our findings may have important translational implications for potential treatment avenues for metabolic diseases. In humans, BAT has been associated with cardiometabolic health, making it a promising target for future therapies45,46,47. In this study, we aimed to understand how the brain affects basic bodily functions with the additional goal of identifying therapeutic targets that would enable more-targeted treatments for cardiometabolic diseases in the future. For example, we showed that by stimulating engram cells in the brain, we were able to upregulate thermogenesis genes in BAT. With the current technological advancements of optogenetics in humans, this line of research opens interesting avenues for future therapeutic approaches.

All experiments with wild-type mice were performed with C57BL/6J mice. All engram-labelling experiments were performed with Fos-tTa17,20, Trap2;Ai32 (refs. 33,48) and Trap2;R26R (refs. 19,34) transgenic mice. Both male and female mice were used. All mice were group housed in a 12:12-h (07:00–19:00) light–dark colony room at 22 °C. Food and water were provided ad libitum and all testing was performed during the light phase. Mice used for experiments were approximately 8–12 weeks of age. All animal work was performed in compliance with the Ryan and Lynch laboratory project licences, with ethical approval of the Trinity College Dublin ethics committee, the Animal Research Ethics Committee from the Health Products Regulatory Authority, and according to the Brigham and Women's Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines.

To capture metabolic and behavioural information, mice were singly housed in metabolic cages (Promethion, Sable Systems) for a duration of 8 h per day. Each cage included a ceiling-mounted food hopper, water bottle and body-mass monitor. Mice had ad libitum access to food and water throughout the entire 8 h. Oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide emission, energy expenditure, body weight, food and water intake and locomotor activity were monitored throughout the session. In brief, respiratory gasses were measured with an integrated fuel cell oxygen analyser, a spectrophotometric carbon dioxide analyser and a water vapour pressure analyser (GA3m1, Sable Systems)49. Before each run, gas sensors were calibrated with 100% N2 as zero reference and with a span gas containing a known concentration of 0.933% CO2. Air flow was measured and controlled with the multichannel mass flow generator (FR8-1, Sable Systems). Flow rate was set at 2,000 ml min–1. Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were measured for each mouse at 3–4-min intervals. Energy expenditure was calculated using the equation50: \({K}_{{\rm{cal}}/{\rm{h}}}=60\times (0.0003941\times {V}_{{{\rm{O}}}_{2}}+0.001106\times {V}_{{{\rm{CO}}}_{2}}\).

Male mice were taken from their home cage each morning and individually housed in the Promethion cages for a maximum of 8 h. On days 1 and 2, mice were placed in the Promethion cages at 21 °C to allow them to habituate to the machine. On day 3, mice were put in the Promethion cages at 21 °C while metabolic and behavioural data were simultaneously recorded to establish baseline measurements (context A). On day 4, the cages were changed before the mice were placed inside. Contextual cues were added to the chambers, including wall and floor patterns, brighter lights, different bedding and three drops of acetic acid odour (context B). Once the mice were placed in the cages, the temperature decreased in increments of approximately 10 °C per hour. As such, the mice spent a total of 6 h in the altered context at a temperature of 4 °C. This was repeated for a total of three days, with metabolic and behavioural data recorded throughout. Mice were then returned and kept in their home cages for a two-day break period. Next, on day 9, mice were put back in the Promethion cages without any of the additional cues at 21 °C to allow for a second baseline measurement (context A). Finally, on day 10 all the additional context cues were added back in before the mice were put into the cages (context B). Temperature was kept at 21 °C and metabolic and behavioural data were simultaneously recorded to establish the test-day measurements.

Mice were placed in the metabolic cages 24 h before odour application. In brief, 20 µl of either H2O or 10% w/v trimethylthiazoline were dropped onto a small 1-cm square piece of filter paper in the cage. Mice were exposed to the odorant for 1 h before being put back into their home cage. Metabolic data were recorded at all times.

The conditioned place preference apparatus consisted of two separate chambers. Each chamber had different wall and floor cues (black and white pattern). Mice could freely enter both chambers through an opening in the wall in the middle of the apparatus. On day 1, mice were taken from their home cage and placed inside the apparatus, where they could freely explore both sides of the apparatus for a total of 20 min. The entire apparatus was kept at 21 °C. On day 2, the opening in the middle wall of the apparatus was closed. During the morning sessions, mice were exposed to one side of the apparatus at 21 °C for a duration of 2 h. Mice were then returned to their home cage for a 2-h break. In the afternoon sessions, mice were then exposed to the other side of the apparatus at 4 °C for a duration of 2 h. This was subsequently repeated for a total of three days. On day 5, the opening in the middle wall of the apparatus was re-opened before mice were placed back in the apparatus. Mice could freely explore both chambers again for a total of 20 min while the entire apparatus was kept at 21 °C. All behaviours were videotaped and subsequently hand scored. Time spent in each chamber in seconds was measured on day 1 (pre-test) and day 5 (test). The time spent in each chamber was normalized using the formula (test phase duration spent in the cold-paired chamber/time spent there in the pre-test phase), to account for any pre-existing preferences51. Both time of day and side of apparatus were counterbalanced across all mice.

Before training, mice were handled for three consecutive days to habituate them to the experimenter. One day before the training day, mice were habituated to the arena and allowed to freely explore the context for 10 min. The next day, mice underwent a contextual fear conditioning protocol. The mice were allowed to explore the arena for the first 3 min. After these 3 min, half of the mice received three foot shocks (0.2 s, 0.75 mA) that were spaced by intervals of 1 min, whereas the other half of the mice received no foot shocks. Mice were subsequently returned to their home cage for 45 min.

Mice were placed into a vacuum-powered four-chamber olfactory arena, which was replicated from previously published designs52. Air entered each corner of the arena at a flow rate of 150 ml min–1 and was odorized by passing through a bottle containing 20 ml of H2O or 350 mM trimethylthiazoline. Mice were exposed to the odour for 5 min and were then euthanized for tissue collection.

Brains and BAT were collected from mice that went through the above-described cold memory timeline. Tissues were collected on BL1, CL1, BL2 and T1. To ensure that the differences seen were due to the differences in conditions and not time of day, all tissues were collected exactly 5 h after the mice were put inside the Promethion cages.

For the contextual fear conditioning experiments, brains and BAT were collected 45 min after the training session ended.

For the predator odour exposure experiments, BAT was collected exactly 1 h after the mice were exposed to the odours.

Mice were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. The next day, brains were transferred into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and kept at 4 °C. They were subsequently sliced in 100-μm coronal sections with a vibratome (Leica VT1200 S) and collected in PBS.

Mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation and adipose tissue was removed by making a careful incision between the shoulder blades. Interscapular BAT was subsequently collected, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.

To get clear immunolabelling, we used the previously described iDISCO-based immunohistochemistry protocol53,54. Sections were rinsed three times in 1× PBS before being dehydrated in 50% MeOH/PBS at room temperature for 2.5 h. Sections were then rinsed three times in 0.2% PBS with Triton X-100 and blocked in 0.2% PBS with Triton X-100 containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide and 6% normal goat serum for 2 h at room temperature. After blocking, slides were washed three times in PBS with 0.2% Tween-20 and 10 μg ml–1 heparin (PTwH). Sections were then incubated with primary antibodies (chicken polyclonal anti-GFP (1:1,000, Invitrogen) and rabbit polyclonal IgG anti-FOS (1:1,000, Synaptic Systems)) at 4 °C on a shaker for three days in PTwH with 5% dimethyl sulfoxide and 3% normal goat serum. On day 4, sections were washed three times in PTwH and incubated with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 568 anti-rabbit IgG (1:500, Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-chicken IgG (1:500, Invitrogen)) overnight at 4 °C. The next day, sections were washed three times in PTwH, followed by three washes in PBS at room temperature. Finally, sections were stained with DAPI in PBS for 10 min followed by a final wash in PBS. Sections were then mounted on superfrost slides using Vectashield DAPI, cover-slipped and sealed.

All images were taken on a confocal scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP8, Leica Microsystems). Fluorescence from DAPI was detected at 417–488 nm, Alexa Fluor 568 was detected at 595–650 nm and Alexa Fluor 488 was detected at 500–550 nm. Sections were imaged with a dry 20× objective (NA 0.70, working distance 0.5 mm), with a pixel size of 1.14 × 1.14 μm2, a z step of 3 μm and a z stack of approximately 25 μm. Fields of view were stitched together to form tiled images using an automated stage and the algorithm of the LAS X software.

To perform automatic brain-wide analysis of FOS+ cells, we used the NeuroInfo software (MBF Bioscience). In brief, immunohistochemistry-labelled whole-brain sections were aligned to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas using the registration tool in the program55. Here brain sections were matched to the most closely corresponding atlas plate. All sections were manually adjusted where necessary, to ensure accurate fit. After the correct atlas plate was identified, all anatomical regions of interest were delineated and measured for size in μm2. Next, FOS+ cells were identified using the cell-detection workflow. Throughout all sections, only cells between 7 μm and 19 μm were counted for size consistency. These parameters were then combined with a deep-learning algorithm to successfully identify FOS+ cells. Counts were then checked for accuracy and adjusted where necessary. Finally, detected cells were mapped to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas and tallied in the corresponding anatomical brain structure. Normalized counts (cells per μm) were subsequently plotted into GraphPad Prism 10.0 for further analysis.

Cross-correlations between all pairs of regions were calculated in R as previously reported32. Pearson's correlations were computed in all cases after which networks were created using the igraph package. To be able to interpret the networks, correlations with an absolute value below 0.5 were not included. Both positive and negative correlations were included in the networks.

To investigate whether FOS and engram activity correlated with metabolic rate, we correlated FOS+ and colabelled eYFP+ (%) with the exact metabolic rate (oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production and energy expenditure) that was measured 45 min before brain collection.

Collected BAT was defrosted at room temperature and transferred to a 2-ml tube, and stainless-steel beads were added to each individual tube. Next, tissues were homogenized in 1 ml TRIzol reagent in a tissue lyser for 2.5 min at 25 pulses per second. Chloroform (200 µl) was subsequently added to each tube, after which they were inverted and left at room temperature for 3 min. All tubes were then centrifuged at 12,000g for 15 min, the RNA was transferred into a new tube and 500 µl isopropanol was added to precipitate the RNA. All tubes were inverted ten times and left at room temperature for 10 min, before being centrifuged again at 12,000g for 10 min. Supernatants were then discarded and all remaining RNA pellets were washed in 1 ml of 25% RNase-free dH2O and 75% ethanol. After being centrifuged at 12,000g for 5 min, all supernatants were discarded by inverting the tube. RNA pellets were left to dry at room temperature for 20–30 min until they were transparent, after which they were resuspended in 50 µl RNase-free water. Finally, RNA was left on ice for 30 min and subsequently put on a heat block at 55 °C for 15 min. A Nanodrop 2000 UV spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to assess RNA quality and concentration. Next, 20 µl cDNA was synthesized from 2 µg of isolated RNA using a cDNA reverse transcription kit (Biosciences Ltd) in a MiniAmp Thermal Cycler (BD Biosciences). qPCRs were then performed to quantify the relative mRNA expression of genes of interest. Relative mRNA levels were calculated using the ∆∆ cycle threshold (∆∆Ct) method and normalized to corresponding endogenous controls (Ppib). All calculated values were plotted into GraphPad Prism 10 for further analysis.

Mice that were used in the optogenetic experiments were implanted with a custom implant containing two optic fibres (200 mm core diameter; Doric Lenses). The optic fibre implant was lowered above the injection site at –1.75 mm dorsoventral. To secure the implant, an even layer of Metabond (C&B Metabond) was applied and left to dry for 15 min. A protective cap was then made from a black polypropylene microcentrifuge tube and secured with dental cement. Animals were then put in a recovery chamber at 29 °C until they were fully recovered from the anaesthesia before being returned to their home cage. Animals were allowed to recover from surgery for approximately 2–3 weeks before behavioural testing.

FOS-tTa transgenic mice were put on a diet containing doxycycline (DOX) 48 h before surgeries. All surgeries were performed when the mice were approximately 7–8 weeks old. Mice were anaesthetized with 500 mg kg–1 avertin and head-fixed on a stereotaxic frame. Bilateral craniotomies were performed using a 0.5-mm diameter drill at –2.00 mm anteroposterior and ±1.35 mm mediolateral. Next, 300 μl AAV9-TRE-ChR2-eYFP was injected on each side using a microsyringe pump (UMP3; WPI) and a Hamilton syringe (701LT; Hamilton) at –2.00 mm anteroposterior, ±1.35 mm mediolateral and –2.00 mm dorsoventral. The injection speed was 60 nl min–1 and the needle was left inside for an additional 10 min after virus delivery to achieve maximum virus spread.

For chemogenetic experiments, TRAP2 mice were injected with 300 μl pAAV-hSyn-DIO-HA-hM4D(Gi)-IRES-mCitrine on each side at –2.00 mm anteroposterior, ±1.35 mm mediolateral and −2.00 mm dorsoventral. The injection speed was 60 nl min–1.

Before implantation, all temperature probes were sterilized. Mice were anaesthetized and positioned on their back as previously described56. Next, all of the skin around the stomach area was sanitized with 70% ethanol and sterilized saline. A small incision was made using a scalpel in the middle of the abdomen, followed by a 1-cm incision in the peritoneum. A temperature probe was subsequently put in the abdominal cavity. Organs were placed over the probe before sewing the peritoneum and skin with sterile stitches.

The TRAP2 system enables the permanent labelling of neurons that were activated by a given experience57. TRAP2 relies on an immediate early gene locus to drive the expression of iCre recombinase combined with a transgenic Cre-dependent effector. The iCre recombinase can be controlled by tamoxifen. As such, when a neuron is active and tamoxifen or 4-OHT is present, the iCre recombinase can enter the nucleus and result in expression of the effector33. The TRAP2 mice were combined with two different reporter lines. For optogenetic experiments, TRAP2 mice were bred with the Ai32 mice48. For engram cell-counting experiments, TRAP2 mice were crossed with the R26R mice34.

To label the cells that were activated during a cold experience, mice were injected with tamoxifen 5 h after being put in the Promethion cages on CL1. As such, all cells that were active during the 6-h cold exposure were labelled. All mice were returned to their home cages immediately after labelling.

Here we used an adeno-associated virus that expresses channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)–eYFP under the control of a tetracycline-responsive element (TRE)-containing promoter (AAV9-TRE-ChR2-eYFP). The TRE promoter is only active in cells that contain the tetracycline transactivator (tTa)42. Therefore, we injected the AAV9-TRE-ChR2-eYFP virus into the DG of Fos-tTa transgenic mice. These mice express tTa under the control of a Fos promoter20. Because FOS is activity dependent, the Fos-tTa transgene will only express tTa in cells that are active during a given experience. By combining the transgenic mice with the virus, we were able to express tTa and ChR2–eYFP in cells that were active during a cold experience. To have temporal control over this system, mice were put on a diet that contained DOX. DOX is an antibiotic that binds to tTa and as such prevents the expression of the transgene ChR2-eYFP.

To label cells activated by a cold experience, DOX food was substituted with standard food 36 h before being exposed to a cold experience. Cold memory engrams were identified as the cells that expressed ChR2–eYFP as a result of being active during the cold. To close the labelling window, mice were immediately put back on DOX food after the initial cold experience.

To label cold-sensitive engrams in Trap2;Ai32 and Trap2;R26R transgenic mice, we intraperitoneally injected mice with 4-OHT (50 mg kg–1, Santa Cruz). All 4-OHT was freshly prepared on the labelling day in a mix of sunflower seed oil and castor oil (4:1, Sigma-Aldrich) at 10 mg ml–1.

To identify the cells that were active during a cold experience, we used Trap2;R26R mice. These mice were chosen because they showed more reliable labelling in the hypothalamus than did other mice. In brief, all mice were injected with tamoxifen 5 h after being put in the Promethion cages on CL1 to label all cells that were active during the 6-h cold exposure. Next, mice were exposed to the rest of the cold memory timeline as described above (two additional training days, a 2-day break and BL2). On the test day, half of the mice were put into context B at 21 °C and half of the mice were kept in their home cage. After exactly 3 h and 45 min all mice were euthanized to enable visualization of the immediate early gene Fos.

All cells were counted using Fiji58. An investigator blinded to treatment counted eYFP+, FOS+ and colabelled cells bilaterally in the DG, LHA, MPO and the LPO. All cell counts were normalized to their respective areas and plotted as cells per μm2.

Shining 472-nm blue light on a ChR2-expressing cell causes ChR2 channels to open, resulting in the depolarization of the neuron. This enables us to evoke memory recall in mice with ChR2-labelled cells. Optogenetic activation was performed through a 450-nm laser diode fibre light source (Doric LDFLS 450/080). Mice with optic fibre implants were attached to a patch cord (MFP_200/240/900-0.22_0.3m_FC-ZF1.25(F)) and allowed to habituate for 8 h before being put through the above-described cold memory timeline. Cold-sensitive engrams were labelled on CL1 and optogenetic reactivation was performed one week later in context A. On the reactivation day, mice were exposed to a 15-min optogenetic stimulation (8 mA) session that was divided into 3-min on and 1-min off periods (that is, 3 min on, followed by 1 min off). During the light-on period, mice received blue-light stimulation (20 Hz) with a pulse width of 15 ms for the entire 3-min duration. During the light-off period, the mice received no light stimulation. To enable animals to return to baseline, each 15-min stimulation period was followed by 1 h of no light stimulation. Mice received a total of three rounds of 15-min stimulation periods. Metabolic rates were measured at all times.

To inhibit cold engrams, we used the same labelling timeline as described above. In brief, mice went through two habituation days and a baseline measurement day in context A, at 21 °C. On day 4, contextual cues were added to the chambers and the mice spent a total of 6 h in the altered context at a temperature of 4 °C. To label the neurons that were active during these 6 h of 4 °C cold exposure, mice were injected with 4-OHT 5 h after being put in the Promethion cages. All mice were returned to their home cages immediately after labelling. Mice subsequently went through two additional training days and were then kept in their home cages for a two-day break period. On day 9, mice were put back in the Promethion cages without any of the additional cues at 21 °C to allow for a second baseline measurement (context A). Finally, on day 10, half of the mice were injected with CNO (2 mg kg–1, Tocris) and half of the mice were injected with saline. Mice were kept in their home cage for 30 min after injection and were then put in the Promethion cages (context B, 21 °C).

All data were analysed using GraphPad Prism 10. All data are mean ± s.e.m. An α level of 0.05 was used as a criterion for statistical significance and probability levels were quoted for non-significance. All statistical analyses performed are reported with their outcomes in Supplementary Data 1 and 2.

Metrics details

Immunotherapies for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other cancers are limited by a lack of tumor-specific targets. Here we discover that RNA-binding proteins and glycosylated RNAs (glycoRNAs) form precisely organized nanodomains on cancer cell surfaces. We characterize nucleophosmin (NPM1) as an abundant cell surface protein (csNPM1) on a variety of tumor types. With a focus on AML, we observe csNPM1 on blasts and leukemic stem cells but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells. We develop a monoclonal antibody to target csNPM1, which exhibits robust anti-tumor activity in multiple syngeneic and xenograft models of AML, including patient-derived xenografts, without observable toxicity. We find that csNPM1 is expressed in a mutation-agnostic manner on primary AML cells and may therefore offer a general strategy for detecting and treating AML. Surface profiling and in vivo work also demonstrate csNPM1 as a target on solid tumors. Our data suggest that csNPM1 and its neighboring glycoRNA–cell surface RNA-binding protein (csRBP) clusters may serve as an alternative antigen class for therapeutic targeting or cell identification.

In recent years, there has been a surge in new therapies that target cell surface molecules, including monoclonal antibodies, antibody–drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor T cells1,2,3,4. These approaches have improved overall survival in a variety of cancers, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer and acute leukemia. While the molecular toolkit for targeting cell surface molecules has rapidly expanded, there remain few clinically actionable targets to leverage these approaches. There have been efforts to better understand and characterize cell surface proteins that are differentially expressed between healthy and cancer states using techniques like proteomics, transcriptomics and phage display5,6,7. Despite the emergence of these unbiased techniques, AML has remained challenging to target with surface-directed therapies, as many highly expressed antigens on AML cells are also present on critical healthy tissue, including hematopoietic stem cells.

Anti-CD33 molecules, like the antibody–drug conjugate gemtuzumab ozogamicin8, have seen some success; however, high expression of CD33 on healthy myeloid cells and hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells has been associated with severe hematological and hepatic toxicity, respectively9. Newer approaches studying both the expression and the physical conformation of proteins on the cell surface have demonstrated promising results, such as an antibody fragment targeting an AML-specific conformation of integrin β2 (ref. 10). Another approach that has gained traction has been targeting HLA-restricted peptides, such as WT1 (ref. 11); however, this approach is limited to a fraction of patients who express specific HLA subtypes. Now there are methods to genetically delete surface proteins from healthy hematopoietic tissue to allow AML cytotoxicity with limited off-target effects12; however, this may be technically cumbersome and costly. Although the majority of clinical efforts have focused on canonical cell surface proteins13, such as those containing a transmembrane domain, there appears to be a need to expand our scope.

There are now three examples of RBPs as surface proteins in preclinical cancer models: PABP1 (ref. 14), nucleolin15,16,17,18 and U5-snRNP200 (ref. 19). There are multiple examples of mutated and dysregulated RBPs in AML, such as SF3B1, U2AF1, SRSF2 and NPM1. In adult AML, nearly 30% of all disease occurrences and approximately 60% of those with a normal karyotype are driven by mutations in NPM1 (refs. 20,21). In these patients, C-terminal mutations of NPM1 cause the replacement of a nucleolar localization signal with a novel nuclear export sequence, leading to cytoplasmic localization of the mutant protein (NPM1c)22. However, it has been unclear whether NPM1 (either wild type (WT) or mutated) is present on the cell surface. Outside of leukemia, autoantibodies in the sera from patients with prostate cancer were shown to react with NPM1, while those from healthy controls did not23, indicating potential aberrant cell surface localization leading to immune recognition.

Here, we provide evidence that NPM1 is expressed on the cell surface in a tumor-selective manner. csNPM1 is present on a diverse set of clinically relevant human and mouse leukemia models and forms nanoscale clusters in physical proximity to other csRBPs and glycoRNAs24,25. We demonstrate that csNPM1 is expressed at increased levels in primary AML in comparison to healthy hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). We also optimize a new mouse immunoglobulin (Ig)G2a antibody (mAb2) targeting NPM1, which does not cause toxicity in healthy mice in vivo. mAb2 shows preferential targeting of murine leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and increases survival in murine models of AML while restoring healthy hematopoiesis. csNPM1 is also present on solid cancers cell lines, and, using in vivo models, we find that targeting csNPM1 has anti-tumor activity in murine models of prostate and colorectal (csNPM1-high) cancer but not melanoma (csNPM1 absent). Collectively, we provide evidence of an RBP that can localize selectively to the surface of cancer cells, which could have important therapeutic implications.

Our examination of cell surface proteomes for csRBPs26 identified NPM1 as a putative cell surface protein, with at least seven datasets showing NPM1 enrichment on the cell surface (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Because NPM1 mislocalization is a driver of leukemia, we first examined the subcellular profile of NPM1 across a panel of nine human myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cell lines (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c), one of which harbors the NPM1c mutation (OCI-AML3). We isolated soluble cytosol and crude membrane fractions and assayed for cytosolic β-actin and endoplasmic reticulum membrane-tethered ribophorin I (RPN1), confirming efficient separation of these pools (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). Blotting with an anti-NPM1 (FC8791) antibody produced a robust band corresponding to NPM1 from the cytosolic and membrane-enriched fraction of most cell lines tested (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). Because OCI-AML3 harbors the C-terminal mutated form of NPM1 (NPM1c), we examined its cellular distribution using a commercially available anti-NPM1c antibody. We found that the NPM1c signal was detected in both the cytosol and the membrane fraction of OCI-AML3 cells (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). We next tested whether the WT antibody could bind to the surface of live cells. To directly visualize the cell surface localization of NPM1, we performed confocal imaging of OCI-AML3 and found that, when applied to live cells, anti-NPM1 (FC8791) binds the cell surface in distinct puncta (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1d). To demonstrate the specificity of the antibody, we performed intracellular immunofluorescence on fixed cells, resulting in the expected nucleolar predominance of NPM1 (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1d). To confirm the cell surface pattern seen when staining live cells, we repeated the experiment with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which is a lectin that binds cell surface glycans. We observed robust WGA cell surface staining with colocalized anti-NPM1 (FC8791) signal (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1e), further confirming NPM1 cell surface presentation.

To assess whether full-length NPM1 or a peptide fragment was presented on the cell surface, we used a sequential biochemical enrichment strategy. Live cell labeling with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, followed by membrane isolation, anti-NPM1 (FC8791) immunoprecipitation and finally western blotting resulted in robust enrichment of NPM1 from K562 membrane fractions (Fig. 1c, left). Using a streptavidin detection reagent on the same material resulted in a specific band migrating at the same molecular weight as NPM1 (Fig. 1c, right), supporting the presence of full-length csNPM1 rather than major histocompatibility complex presentation, as shown in other cases27. As many cell surface proteins are glycosylated, we next investigated whether NPM1 was similarly modified. While NPM1 has no N-glycan sequons, it does have many predicted sites for O-linked N-acetylgalactosamine (Extended Data Fig. 1f). Furthermore, we selectively enriched NPM1 from membrane lysates with a sialic acid-binding lectin (Extended Data Fig. 1g), suggesting that NPM1 can become glycosylated, consistent with a previous report28.

The presence of full-length csNPM1 and the punctate pattern observed with confocal microscopy in Fig. 1a motivated a more detailed investigation of its cell surface organization. We performed super-resolution (SR) single-molecule localization microscopy (Extended Data Fig. 1h) using a primary conjugated anti-NPM1 (FC8791) antibody for staining HL-60 (NPM1-WT) and OCI-AML3 (NPM1c) cells (Fig. 1d–h and Extended Data Fig. 1h). Staining live cells as in Fig. 1a and imaging with diffraction-limited widefield epifluorescent microscopy yielded an expected punctate pattern of csNPM1 (Fig. 1d,f). We obtained SR reconstructions for a total of five OCI-AML3 cells and three HL-60 cells (Supplementary Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1h,i). In both AML models, the SR reconstructions showed csNPM1 forming distinct clusters of apparently uniform size and regular patterning (Fig. 1d–g). We implemented a semi-automated cluster analysis workflow (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1i). The diameter of csNPM1 clusters was on average 119 nm and 165 nm in HL-60 and OCI-AML3 cells, respectively (Fig. 1h). We then determined the number of localizations observed per cluster and the cluster-to-cluster distance. Across both cell lines, clusters were regularly spaced at approximately 300–330 nm apart (Fig. 1h), while the number of localizations was less uniform with clusters of two types: one with 50–80 and a second with 120–140 localizations per cluster (Fig. 1h). Using the SR data, we calculated the approximate number of antibodies bound per cell, finding ~1,000–2,400 and ~3,000–24,000 per cell on HL-60 and OCI-AML3 cells, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). A similar number was obtained by an orthogonal method using quantitative flow cytometry (Extended Data Fig. 1j). Together, the overall distribution of csNPM1 is reminiscent of a tessellated pattern on the cell surface.

Aside from rare examples, RBPs like NPM1 are not commonly thought to occupy the surface of living cells. Our recent work has begun to explore this concept more generally26; however, there remains an overall lack of molecular understanding of what factors may associate with cell surface RBPs. To address this, we adapted a strategy previously used to label glycoRNAs24, csRBPs26 and other proteins29 in proximity to glycan ligands. Using a primary antibody specific to csNPM1, a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was applied, which activates biotin-phenol (protein labeling) or biotin-aniline (RNA labeling) to label cell surface molecules in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1i and Supplementary Table 2). To ensure robust recovery of proximal proteins, we selected the three AML models with the highest csNPM1 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) fold change over isotype: MOLM-13, OCI-AML3 and Kasumi-1 cells (Extended Data Fig. 2a). After capture of the biotinylated proteins and analysis of those hits enriched over the isotype labeling, we examined the enriched Gene Ontology (GO) cellular compartment (CC) terms. Membrane terms were highly enriched, suggesting that our approach was overall successful for assaying components of the cell surface (Fig. 1j). In addition, other GO terms such as cytosol, ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex and nucleoplasm were also enriched (Fig. 1j). At the individual gene level, we found that MOLM-13, OCI-AML3 and Kasumi-1 cells had many unique hits (Fig. 1k, left three bars), and RBPs comprised 61.1%, 60.5% and 71% of the proteins proximal to csNPM1 (Fig. 1k). Notably, NPM1 was found in all three proximity labeling datasets as anticipated from our data above (Supplementary Table 2). Hits found in common between the AML models tested were more likely to be RBPs, as 75.9% of hits found proximal to csNPM1 in at least two cell lines were annotated RBPs (Supplementary Table 2). Together, these data suggest that csNPM1 clusters into distinct RBP-enriched nanodomains on the surface of leukemia cells.

We next assessed the levels of csNPM1 on the nine human cell lines tested in Extended Data Fig. 1b, and, in all lines, live cell staining with the anti-NPM1 (FC8791) antibody demonstrated staining above isotype levels, albeit to different degrees (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a). While cancer cell lines are efficient at growing in vitro, over time, cultures adapt to these conditions, which may select for states that deviate from their in vivo state, where niche environments are important30,31,32. Here, we harvested leukemic marrow from four primary murine leukemia models driven by MLL-AF4 (KMT2A-AFF1), MLL-AF9 (KMT2A-MLLT3), MLL-ENL (KMT2A-MLLT1) and NPM1c, all in a Flt3ITD/+ background33,34. In all four genotypes, we observed cell surface binding with anti-NPM1 (B0556) antibody (Fig. 2b, top), demonstrating that primary murine AML also presents csNPM1. To understand whether this effect was stable ex vivo, we evaluated how csNPM1 changed upon in vitro culture of Npm1cA/+;Flt3ITD/+ AML cells. After 7 days in culture, these cells still robustly expressed csNPM1 (Extended Data Fig. 2b), although direct comparison to the in vivo data is not possible because these samples were analyzed on different days. As compared to the AML cell lines, we saw a larger distribution in the fraction and intensity of csNPM1-positive cells in primary murine AMLs. Whole-cell levels of NPM1 assessed by flow cytometry after fixation and permeabilization demonstrated similar levels and profiles across all four genotypes (Fig. 2b, bottom), suggesting that csNPM1 levels are not purely a product of total cellular abundance. The broad expression of csNPM1 in models with or without NPM1c and the higher expression in models with NPM1c (that is, OCI-AML3 and Npm1cA/+;Flt3ITD/+ murine AML) raises the question of whether both the WT and mutant forms of NPM1 can be presented on the cell surface, especially considering that NPM1c can form heterodimers with WT NPM1 (ref. 35). To explore this, we designed overexpression vectors encoding NPM1-WT or NPM1c with Ty1 N-terminal tags. Using an anti-NPM1 antibody, we found that the overexpression of either NPM1-WT-Ty1 or NPM1c-Ty1 further increased the levels of csNPM1 as compared to those in K562 cells bearing an empty vector (Fig. 2c). Using the anti-Ty1 antibody, we also found that both NPM1-WT-Ty1- and NPM1c-Ty1-expressing cells were detectable by flow cytometry (Fig. 2c), suggesting that both the WT and NPM1c forms are capable of reaching the cell surface. Consistently, cells expressing an empty vector had little binding when stained with the anti-Ty1 antibody (Fig. 2c). In sum, these data suggest that csNPM1 is presented in many in vitro leukemia models and in vivo primary murine AML models, regardless of NPM1 mutation status.

The FC8791 monoclonal antibody was raised against the C-terminal region of human NPM1. This domain is highly conserved between mice, monkeys and humans (Extended Data Fig. 2c), suggesting that there is a possibility of developing a cross-species reactive antibody, which would be desirable for clinical translation. We sought to develop an antibody derived from a human immune system, thus minimizing the potential risk of anti-drug antibodies in humans36,37. Previously, an NPM1c mutant-specific binder was selected from a human scFv library38. Using this as a baseline, we constructed a mouse IgG2a antibody (mAb2) targeting NPM1 (Extended Data Fig. 2d) and evaluated its binding features. Mouse IgG2a was selected for its capacity to induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity39, which would enable anti-cancer immunity. First, we analyzed the signal of FC8791 and mAb2 from whole-cell lysate as well as extracted membranes, which demonstrated nearly identical banding patterns (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Next, we used mAb2 for live cell flow cytometry, and mAb2 was able to fully shift signal from OCI-AML3 cells above that of the isotype control (Fig. 2d). Evaluation of the binding pattern by confocal microscopy of OCI-AML3 cells showed that both FC8791 and mAb2 formed puncta on the cell periphery (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 2f, top). The distribution of signal was different upon fixation and permeabilization. Specifically, FC8791, which was raised against a 100% NPM1-WT peptide, displayed a highly nucleolar pattern with limited signal from the cytosol (Fig. 2e, bottom). By contrast, mAb2 had a more prominent cytosolic signal while still retaining nucleolar staining (Fig. 2e, bottom), consistent with mAb2 having some specificity for NPM1c, which is mislocalized to the cytoplasm. Co-staining live cells with mAb2 and WGA demonstrated that the mAb2 pattern was restricted to the cell surface (Extended Data Fig. 2g), and co-staining of cells with mAb2 and FC8791 demonstrated overlapping signals (Extended Data Fig. 2h), suggesting a common cell surface target. We also examined the cell surface binding of mAb2 on primary murine MLL-ENL/Flt3ITD/+ bone marrow (BM) cells, which showed poor and non-specific staining with an isotype control antibody, while mAb2 staining produced punctate, cell surface-specific clusters (Extended Data Fig. 2i) as seen on the human AML cell lines.

To validate the specificity of mAb2 using functional genetics, we generated CRISPR–Cas9 NPM1-knockout cells using the OCI-AML2 cell line. Upon genetic ablation of NPM1, we lost cell surface mAb2 binding, while surface expression of CD47 remained unchanged (Extended Data Fig. 2j,k), suggesting that mAb2 loss was not a non-specific finding. Finally, to further explore the csRBP clustering phenotype we observed with csNPM1 and given that we have also found glycoRNAs in proximity to other csRBP clusters26, we performed an RNA proximity labeling experiment on OCI-AML3 cells with mAb2. RNA from cells stained with mAb2 and then labeled with biotin-aniline revealed a high-molecular-weight biotin smear that was sensitive to RNase and sialidase (Fig. 2f), which is consistent with cell surface glycoRNA labeling24. Together, these data suggest that mAb2 targets csNPM1 and that this RBP is in proximity to glycoRNAs.

Given the presence of csNPM1 on primary murine models of AML and human cell lines, we next assessed its presence on primary human AML. We obtained cryopreserved BM aspirates from healthy donors and patients with AML and performed flow cytometry using a myeloid leukemia panel (CD45, CD34, CD117, CD33, CD13, HLA-DR). Malignant blasts were coarsely identified as side scatter (SSC) low (SSClo) and CD45dim (Fig. 3a, middle, and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Across 12 BM aspirates (set A), including the gating example from patient 3 (Fig. 3a), the blast population generally showed a robust shift above isotype control with mAb2 (Fig. 3b). We next expanded our primary sample cohort to 31 patient samples encompassing various genotypes and immunophenotypes, including primary and secondary AMLs (that is, progressing from myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative neoplasm) (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 3). AML blasts consistently showed a substantially enriched csNPM1 population as compared to the isotype control (Fig. 3d). Despite the set A patients having a wide range of identified mutations through genetic analysis (Fig. 3c), all except patient 8 demonstrated clear mAb2 binding (Fig. 3b). Most profiles were unimodal, with between 21% and 54% of cells being mAb2+ (Fig. 3b, for example, AML BM 3, 5 and 9–12). Next we compared the relative binding efficacy of mAb2 to that of FC8791, which is a well-studied anti-NPM1 antibody (Extended Data Fig. 3b). On OCI-AML3 and two primary patient samples, we observed that both antibodies bind the malignant SSCloCD45dim populations, while mAb2 consistently showed higher MFI. We then examined whether mAb2 could also target csNPM1 in primary murine AML models by performing live staining followed by flow cytometry analysis, finding that mAb2 could bind these cells as well, driven by Npm1cA/+;Flt3ITD/+, MLL-AF9/Flt3ITD/+, MLL-ENL/Flt3ITD/+ and Npm1c;NrasG12D/+ (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Overall, the broadly observed and high levels of mAb2 binding on AML BM suggest that csNPM1 could serve as a genotype-agnostic marker of AML.

Although mAb2 strongly stains cancer cells, avoiding healthy HSPCs will be critical to avoid the associated toxicities seen with other AML targets (that is, CD33 and CD123)40. To understand in detail where, and to what degree, csNPM1 is presented on healthy cells, we studied this in both human and primary mouse models. We examined this by measuring mAb2 binding on B cells (CD19), T cells (CD3), myeloid cells (CD33) and HSPCs (CD34). In both human peripheral blood (PB) and BM from healthy donors, there was minimal binding in T lymphocytes and stronger binding in CD33+ myeloid cells, while B lymphocytes showed higher binding in BM than in PB (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). Both CD33+SCChi (neutrophils) and CD33+SSClo (monocytes) had ~70% mAb2 binding. To understand how this degree of positivity compares to a malignant state, we assessed the MFI for mAb2 across BM cell populations and the OCI-AML3 human AML cell line (Extended Data Fig. 4c). On average, lineage-differentiated BM populations showed tenfold less binding intensity than OCI-AML3 cells. Next, examining CD45dimCD34+ cells (HSPCs), we found an approximate tenfold reduction in binding compared to lineage cells and an approximate 100-fold lower binding than that on OCI-AML3 cells (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Thus, while a subpopulation of healthy hematopoietic cells are stained by mAb2 (percent positive), the total amount of antibody binding (MFI) is significantly less on healthy human cells than in a human AML model.

We next assessed mAb2 binding on healthy mouse hematopoietic cells. Similar to our findings with human samples, mAb2 binding was preferentially seen in BM neutrophils (MAC1+GR1+) and monocytes (MAC1+GR1−), ranging between 20% and 30% of each population (Extended Data Fig. 4d). There was ~10% binding in BM T and B cells. Again, we found low-level binding on mouse hematopoietic progenitors (lineage negative (Lin−)Kit+) and stem cells (Lin−Kit+SCA1+) (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e). Due to limited binding on HSPCs, we predicted that mAb2 would have a minimal impact on normal hematopoiesis.

Significance as in a.

To examine the potential toxicity that mAb2 treatment might have in vivo, we used WT (C57BL/6J) mice and injected them intraperitoneally (i.p.) with three different doses (2.5, 5 and 10 mg kg−1) of mAb2 or an isotype control (5 mg kg−1). No significant differences were observed in PB counts or the total body weight of mice after 4 weekly treatments at any given dose (Extended Data Fig. 5a). At the end of treatment, no significant weight differences were observed in the spleens, livers or kidneys (Extended Data Fig. 5b). We next examined the impact of mAb2 treatment in sublethally irradiated mice. After weekly injections of 10 mg kg−1 of mAb2 or 5 mg kg−1 of isotype control, there were no differences in blood counts or total body weight between treatment arms after 4 weeks (Extended Data Fig. 5c). These mice were kept for 5 additional weeks after the final treatment, and there were still no detectable health issues or tissue weight changes observed (Extended Data Fig. 5d). Overall, these data suggest that the mAb2 antibody is well tolerated and shows no transient or lasting toxicity on normal hematopoiesis in vivo.

To establish whether mAb2 has anti-leukemic efficacy, we first used a primary mouse AML model driven by Npm1cA/+;Flt3ITD/+/RosaCas9/+. This model possesses the highest levels of csNPM1 among the primary murine models tested (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3c). We used sublethally irradiated, immunocompetent mice, which were injected with primary murine Npm1cA/+;Flt3ITD/+/RosaCas9/+ AML cells. After AML engraftment, mice were treated weekly with either isotype control or mAb2 at 5 mg kg−1. Examining the PB 4 weeks after treatment, mice treated with mAb2 had significantly lower levels of the Cas9 transgene than those given the isotype control (Fig. 4a). Moreover, we observed significantly lower white blood cell counts in mice treated with mAb2 than in those treated with the isotype control, indicating decreased leukemic burden. With improved leukemia control, there was hematopoietic recovery, as shown by white blood cell counts, red blood cells and hemoglobin returning to irradiation-only control levels (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Because splenomegaly is one of the key indicators of AML engraftment and expansion in vivo, we examined spleen sizes and found that the mAb2-treated cohort had significantly smaller spleens than the isotype-treated cohort (Fig. 4b). Finally, examination of the overall survival demonstrated that weekly i.p. treatment with mAb2 significantly prolonged survival when compared to the isotype-treated cohort (Fig. 4c). Overall, our results show that mAb2 treatment impaired leukemic engraftment and expansion in a primary murine Npm1cA/+;Flt3ITD/+/RosaCas9/+ AML model while significantly prolonging survival.

Based on mAb2's efficacy in high-csNPM1 models, we next assessed its in vivo efficacy in AML models with lower levels of csNPM1. We used the primary murine MLL-AF9/Flt3ITD/+ AML model, which showed an intermediate amount of mAb2 binding (Extended Data Fig. 3c). These cells, which contain a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) marker, were transplanted and treated as above. We observed that the AML burden (YFP+) in PB was significantly lower in the mAb2-treated cohort than in the cohort treated with the isotype control after just 72 h of treatment (Fig. 4d). Total blood counts further showed that markers of leukemia were reduced in the treated cohort, while again red blood cells, hemoglobin and platelets were all increased, suggesting improved hematopoiesis (Extended Data Fig. 6c). Notably, the leukemia-infiltrated spleen, liver and lungs were significantly smaller in the mAb2-treated cohort than in the cohort treated with the isotype control, suggesting strong anti-leukemic efficacy in those tissues (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 6d). Treatment with mAb2 significantly prolonged survival (Fig. 4f), indicating that mAb2 can also effectively target AML with intermediate csNPM1 levels.

To establish the killing mechanism of mAb2, we transplanted MLL-AF9/Flt3ITD/+ AML into immunocompromised mice (NOD severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) gamma (NSG)), which lack natural killer cells to participate in Fc-mediated ADCC and also have an impaired complement system. In NSG mice, we did not observe any differences in the overall survival or the spleen size of mice treated with mAb2 compared to the isotype control (Fig. 4g,h). These findings suggest that mAb2's mechanism of action is dependent on ADCC and/or complement-dependent cytotoxicity. To further investigate our findings, we used CB17-SCID mice, which are deficient in B and T cells but have intact innate immunity, including complement41. CB17-SCID mice harboring human OCI-AML3 cells had significantly improved survival in the mAb2-treated cohort (Fig. 4i), solidifying that the anti-leukemic effect we observe is immune mediated.

Finally, to assess whether mAb2 has the potential to target human AML patient cells in vivo, we performed flow cytometry analysis to examine csNPM1 levels in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model driven by an MLL rearrangement (MLL-R), which is seen in 40% of pediatric leukemia and 5–12% of adult AML42. We found high csNPM1 levels on the engrafted PDX model, whereas the host mouse BM had significantly lower csNPM1 levels (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f). Finally, mAb2 treatment of CB17-SCID mice bearing this PDX led to significant survival prolongation (Fig. 4j) and reduced PDX engraftment (Fig. 4k). These results suggest that mAb2 is highly efficacious in vivo and in the context of clinically relevant human AML.

It has been reported that IL-7R−Lin−Sca-1−c-Kit+CD34+FcγRII/III+ GMP-like leukemic cells (L-GMP) and CD93+ subpopulations are linked to the generation and maintenance of AMLs driven by MLL43,44. Using the primary murine MLL-AF9/Flt3ITD/+ AML model (treatment as in Fig. 4d), we detected considerable csNPM1 levels on the surface of L-GMP+ and CD93+ populations compared to the isotype control (Fig. 5a). Additionally, there was a significant reduction of L-GMP+ and CD93+ subpopulations in the mAb2-treated cohort when compared to the isotype control-treated mice (Fig. 5b). To show that mAb2 treatment leads to functional impairment of leukemic stem cells, we performed secondary transplantations using the engrafted BM from leukemic mice treated with either mAb2 or isotype control (treated as in Fig. 4d). Following secondary transplantation, mice were left untreated, and we observed that secondary recipients from the mAb2 cohort showed improved overall survival as compared to the isotype control (Fig. 5c). These results indicate that mAb2 treatment targets AML stem cell- or leukemia-propagating compartments.

Furthermore, to assess the potential of csNPM1 as a marker of leukemia initiation and progression, we examined mAb2 surface staining of isogenic primary murine BM HSPCs (Lin−) from WT, Npm1cA/+ or Npm1cA/+;Flt3ITD/+ mice. In this model, Npm1cA/+ has a preleukemic phenotype, while Npm1cA/+;Flt3ITD/+ mice have overt leukemia. There was a clear ‘stage-dependent' increase in mAb2 surface binding where Npm1cA/+;Flt3ITD/+ cells had evidently more csNPM1 than the isogenic Npm1cA/+ preleukemic cells or the WT BM, which had little to no surface binding (Fig. 5d). In summary, these findings suggest that csNPM1 may be preferentially expressed in the leukemia-initiating cell fraction in murine models of leukemia.

To explore csNPM1 binding on the HSPC population from primary patient leukemia samples, we coarsely defined HSPCs as CD45dimCD3−CD19−CD34+ cells45. As expected, this immature population was in low abundance in healthy BM (Fig. 5e, set B) and poorly stained with mAb2 over the isotype signal (13.4% positive; Fig. 5e). Examining a BM aspirate from a patient with AML demonstrated a markedly expanded CD45dim population, representing malignant blasts. This patient's blasts had aberrant CD19 expression, which is a relatively common phenomenon in AML46. Within this sample, there was a minor population of CD19−CD3−CD34+ HSPCs, which were demonstrably better bound by mAb2, both in percent positive (63%) and fluorescent intensity (Fig. 5f).

To understand how this pattern appears across AML patient sample set B (three healthy and six AML BM aspirates), we first looked at all CD45+ cells, where 34–54% of healthy and 14–61% of AMLs were mAb2+, with the reference OCI-AML3 being 100% positive (Fig. 5g). However, when next considering the CD45dimCD34+CD3−CD19− stem-like population, only 8–13% of healthy samples but 25–75% of AML samples were mAb2+ (Fig. 5g). Motivated by the intensity difference seen between Fig. 3a,b, we next quantified the MFI of mAb2 binding on CD45dimCD34+CD3−CD19− HSPCs. HSPC populations from AML samples had significantly higher MFI values of mAb2 binding than the homogeneously low MFI values observed on healthy HSPCs (Fig. 5h). This set of healthy and patient BM samples suggests that, by both fraction bound and intensity bound, mAb2 selectively binds csNPM1 on the surface of primitive malignant cells. We expanded this type of analysis to examine the 13 patient samples in set C (Fig. 5i and Extended Data Fig. 7a–c). NPM1c leukemic blasts are generally CD34 negative, unlike most other AML subtypes. However, studies characterizing the minor fraction of CD34+ cells from NPM1c samples show that mutated NPM1 protein can also be found in this subset. Additionally, when CD34+ cells from NPM1c samples are transplanted, they can reconstitute a CD34− leukemia, thus suggesting that CD34+ cells from NPM1c are leukemia-initiating cells47. First looking at one patient with AML (set C, AML BM 12), we observed that csNPM1 expression among CD45dim cells was predominantly within the CD34+ fraction (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Analyzing the other 12 patients as well as CD34+ enriched healthy donor cells showed that csNPM1 was upregulated in the CD34+ subset of all AML samples (Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). The CD45dimCD34+ fraction from NPM1c samples had the most csNPM1 signal as compared to CD34− blasts. Overall, in human samples, there is a clear preferential binding for csNPM1 in the HSPC population of malignant marrow that is not present in healthy marrow. Additional studies will be needed to assess whether this binding is preferential to bona fide human leukemic stem cells.

Given the genotype-agnostic binding of mAb2 across a diverse set of AML models and primary samples, we hypothesized that csNPM1 could also mark solid tumors. To assess this, we measured mAb2 binding across 47 human and mouse solid tumor models from various tissue origins using flow cytometry (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 4). We saw varying degrees of mAb2 binding in multiple tissue types. There was no binding in B16F10 murine melanoma and little binding in multiple models of human pancreatic cancer. Given the binding on solid tumors, we next sought to assess whether we could achieve in vivo efficacy with mAb2. We turned to a syngeneic model of prostate cancer, in which primary normal murine prostate epithelial cells had little to no mAb2 binding while primary murine prostate carcinoma cells (Pten−/−;Trp53−/−) had clear staining above isotype (Fig. 6b). After engrafting syngeneic tumors in C57BL/6 mice, animals were treated on days 5, 7 and 9 with 10 mg kg−1 of mAb2 or isotype control. We found that mAb2 treatment reduced the tumor volume, while isotype-treated animals had significantly larger tumors at 14 and 17 days after engraftment (Fig. 6c,d). To extend this observation beyond prostate carcinoma, we also evaluated the activity of mAb2 against a murine colorectal cancer model (MC38) that is also bound by mAb2 (Fig. 6e). In this syngeneic model, we also observed significant reduction in tumor volume at 10 and 13 days after transplantation in C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 6f,g). Finally, to establish the specificity of this effect, we examined the activity of mAb2 on the murine melanoma line B16F10, which has no significant mAb2 binding (Fig. 6a,h). As expected, treatment of B16F10-transplanted syngeneic mice with mAb2 has no impact on tumor volume when compared to isotype-treated controls (Fig. 6i). These data suggest that mAb2 induces anti-tumor activity in vivo in csNPM1-positive solid tumors.

Here, we show that NPM1, a frequently mutated protein in AML and an often dysregulated protein in malignancy, can be found on the cell surface. Because csRBPs such as NPM1 lack a transmembrane domain and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked anchors, we focused on the molecular organization of csNPM1 by combining mass spectrometry (MS) and SR microscopy methods. Cell surface proximity labeling defined many other csRBPs and glycoRNAs within the molecular neighborhoods of csNPM1, consistent with our recent observation of csRBP clusters (for example, DDX21, hnRNP-U, etc.) on other cell types26. Similarly, the SR reconstructions of csNPM1 on AML cells are highly similar to those of DDX21 and hnRNP-U on adherent cell lines26; such a non-random, structured organization suggests the existence of an underlying regulatory mechanism guiding the nanoscale arrangement of these clusters.

Although this study does not fully elucidate the mechanism that drives the surface expression of csNPM1, we do identify that csNPM1 from membrane fractions is bound by sialic acid-specific lectins. Given the predicted O-linked glycosylation sites in NPM1, these findings would suggest that NPM1 can be glycosylated. Protein glycosylation is not only critical to appropriate folding, but it can dictate trafficking, which may in turn be indispensable for NPM1's cell surface localization. Interestingly, others have identified that cell surface nucleolin is glycosylated, and this modification is important for its localization48. There is much to be learned about the mechanisms that govern how csRBPs are glycosylated and how this might relate to malignancy.

Aberrant protein expression and localization is a common feature of malignancies. Recent work from our groups has shown that the glycoRNA–csRBP clusters can serve as regulators of cell-penetrating peptide entry26, while others have shown that csRBPs can bind viruses and mediate ligand internalization49. Given these findings and the commonality of csNPM1 in multiple models of malignancy shown here, this suggests that csNPM1 and its molecular neighborhood on the cell surface may play a functional role in tumorigenesis. Future work enabled by new tools to manipulate csRBPs directly could allow for a direct understanding of csNPM1's (and that of other csRBPs) impact on cellular state.

In this study, we focused on csNPM1 as a target for opsonization and immune-mediated destruction of target cells. This approach, if successfully translated to humans, offers substantial advancements in existing anti-cancer therapies. First, csNPM1 expression was mutation agnostic, which enables its potential use in a multitude of patients. Current advancements in AML therapy have used small molecules that work on a subset of patients based on their driver mutations50,51. Second, other approved anti-AML therapies that are not mutation specific work by inducing DNA damage, which can cause off-target toxicities52. Within the healthy hematopoietic system, csNPM1 has limited expression and importantly is not present on healthy HSCs. Whereas most approved therapies drive life-threatening cytopenias by also affecting normal hematopoiesis53, we do not see this in mouse models. Upon mAb2 treatment of mice with AML, we saw improvement in blood counts, which indicate simultaneous eradication of leukemia and unperturbed normal hematopoiesis.

Furthermore, there were no observable weight changes in mice to suggest broader toxicity, which is reassuring, as NPM1 is well conserved between humans and mice. Ultimately, non-human primate and human studies will be needed to assess whether csNPM1 is expressed on vital non-hematopoietic tissue. If it was expressed on healthy tissues, one interesting prospect is to develop antibodies against mutant NPM1, as we observed both WT and mutant forms on NPM1-mutant models. By targeting a mutant form with an antibody, one could limit off-target effects further. Interestingly, given that there are other RBPs mutated in AML54, if they are also found to be on the cell surface, they could represent novel targets.

Finally, an important goal in AML therapy development has been to target leukemic stem cells55. In our mouse models, we indeed see that csNPM1 is a marker of LSCs, which may in part explain the significant survival benefit offered by anti-csNPM1 therapy. Although our study is not powered to assess human LSCs, we do see increased anti-NPM1 expression in the CD34+ fraction of NPM1c AML marrow, which is notable for having CD34− blasts. This would suggest that there is a primitive population that has csNPM1 in these samples, which we do not observe in healthy BM tissue. Phenotypically, LSCs are defined by their ability to initiate leukemia in limiting dilution transplantation experiments55. Therefore, a focus of future efforts will be to characterize csNPM1+ leukemic cells in transplantation models that have been created to foster human leukemogenesis. LSCs are better characterized in mouse leukemia models43,44, and, as we illustrated in this study, csNPM1 is upregulated in well-defined and clinically relevant murine LSCs.

The finding of csNPM1 prompts a need to reevaluate cell surface proteomics to ensure that non-canonical findings are studied, rather than discarded as noise. With multiple examples now of cancer-specific csRBPs (csNPM1, cs-U5 snRNP200 (ref. 19), etc.), there is a clear need to better investigate their biology in other normal and abnormal contexts. Beyond monoclonal antibodies, these proteins could serve as optimal targets for antibody–drug conjugates and chimeric antigen receptor cell products, thus bringing novel therapies to the patients who need them most.

Flt3ITD/+ (Flt3 internal tandem duplication) mice were kindly provided by G. Gilliland (Harvard Medical School, USA) and crossed with Rosa26Cas9/+ mice. Freshly isolated BM from 6–10-week-old female Flt3ITD/+;Rosa26Cas9/+ or moribund Npm1fl−cA/+;Flt3ITD/+;Rosa26Cas9/+, Npm1fl−cA/+;NrasG12D/+ mice were used. BM cells were exposed to erythrocyte lysis (BD Pharm Lyse, BD Biosciences), followed by magnetic bead selection of Lin− cells using the Lineage Cell Depletion Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lin− cells were cultured in X-VIVO 20 (Lonza) supplemented with 5% FBS (Life Technologies), 10 ng ml−1 IL-3 (PeproTech), 10 ng ml−1 IL-6 (PeproTech) and 50 ng ml−1 SCF (PeproTech) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin–glutamine. The retroviral constructs pMSCV-MLL-AF9-IRES-YFP and pMSCV-MLL-ENL-IRES-Neo were used with the package plasmid psi-Eco to produce retrovirus. Next, 293T cells (Life Technologies) were cultured and prepared for transduction in 10-cm plates. For virus production, 5 μg of the above plasmids and 5 μg of the psi-Eco packaging vector were transfected dropwise into the 293T cells using 47.5 μl TransIT-LT1 (Mirus) and 600 μl Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). The resulting viral supernatant was collected as previously described. Transduction of primary Flt3ITD/+;Rosa26Cas9/+ mouse cells was performed in six-well plates as mentioned above. After transduction, transduced cells were sorted for YFP (for MLL-AF9) or selected with neomycin (for MLL-ENL).

Normal prostate tissue was derived from Rosa26-LSL-Cas9 knockin mice on B6J (strain 26175, Jackson Laboratory), and Pten−/−;Trp53−/− prostate tumors were derived from a mouse model of prostate cancer of the same genetic background similar to Feng et al.57. Tissues were minced into small pieces and transferred into a gentleMACS C tube (Miltenyi Biotec) for enzymatic digestion using the Multi Tissue Dissociation Kit 1 (130-110-201, Miltenyi Biotec). Digestion was performed in a gentleMACS Dissociator using the program 37C_Multi_A. Following enzymatic dissociation, the cell suspension was pelleted, resuspended and filtered through a 70‐μm cell strainer. Normal and tumoral dissociated prostate cells were cultured as 3D organoids using the protocol and medium composition described by Drost et al.58. Cultures were maintained under these conditions for 6–7 days to enrich for epithelial cells, after which cells were maintained as monolayer cultures on plates coated with collagen I (354236, Corning) using the same medium composition.

For virus production, 293FT cells were transfected with the lentiviral vector (lentiCRISPR-v2) either as an empty vector or containing NPM1 guide RNA together with the packaging plasmids psPAX2 (Addgene, 12260) and pMD2.G (Addgene, 12259). The viral supernatant was collected 48 and 72 h after transfection and concentrated overnight at 6,000g and 4 °C. A total of 1 × 106 cells and viral supernatant were mixed in 2 ml culture medium supplemented with 8 μg ml−1 polybrene (Millipore), followed by spinfection (60 min, 900g, 32 °C), and were further incubated overnight at 37 °C. The medium was refreshed on the following day, and the transduced cells were cultured further. Pellets for protein were collected 7 and 9 days after transduction.

OCI-AML2 cells were transduced with either NPM1 gRNAs or control gRNAs. Cell pellets were collected on day 7 after transduction and lysed with whole-cell lysis buffer (0.2% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 450 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA), 1× protease inhibitor cocktail 1 (Merck), 1× phosphatase inhibitor 2 (Merck), 1× phosphatase inhibitor 3 (Merck) and 1 mM DTT (Epigentek)) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The lysates were then centrifuged at 20,000g and 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and quantified using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Following quantification, the samples were supplemented with 1× LDS sample buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1× Sample Reducing Agent (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and they were then incubated at 70 °C for 10 min. Next, 10 μg protein was loaded. Western blotting was performed using SDS–PAGE gels, and samples were blotted onto a PVDF membrane. It was performed using the following antibodies: anti-NPM1 (FC8791), anti-H3 (Abcam, ab1220) as a loading control at a 1:1,000 dilution and goat anti-mouse IgG H&L, HRP conjugated (Abcam, ab205719) at a 1:10,000 dilution.

For blood counts, 20 μl blood was collected from the tail vein of mice using a capillary pipette containing anticoagulants (EDTA). The EDTA anticoagulated blood samples were used to obtain a complete blood count with a Vet ABC analyzer (Horiba ABX). Samples were counted no longer than 20 min after blood was drawn.

Genomic DNA (10 ng) was used, and the levels of Cas9 and Gapdh were analyzed on a QuantStudio 5 real-time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems) using PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosciences). The relative quantification of Cas9 was performed using the comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method against the housekeeping gene Gapdh. The primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 3.

For Extended Data Fig. 6b, genomic DNA was extracted from murine PB 2 weeks after injection using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen).

Primary antibodies, at a concentration of 0.5 μg per reaction, either anti-NPM1 (mAb2) or the IgG2a isotype control (Bio X Cell), were precomplexed with a 1:1,000 dilution of the secondary antibody goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (Abcam) for 30 min. For intracellular staining, cells were first permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature and rinsed with 2% FBS in 1× PBS. For cell surface staining (‘live cell'), cells were processed directly. BM cells were blocked in 2% FBS in 1× PBS for 30 min on ice and then stained with the precomplexed mix of antibodies as stated above.

Afterward, they were incubated with WGA conjugated to fluorescein (Vector Laboratories, FL-1021-5) at a concentration of 1:1,000. When colabeled with FC8791 or mAb2, antibodies were precomplexed with anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 647 at a ratio of 2:1 before being incubated with cells. The final concentration of FC8791 and mAb2 was 5 µg ml−1, and the secondary antibody was used at 2.5 µg ml−1.

For primary murine AML experiments related to Fig. 5a,b, 6–10-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were sublethally irradiated with a whole-body dose of 5.5 Gy and then injected with 106 primary murine AML cells by intravenous injection from the indicated animal AML model, as described above. Upon animal sickness on day 18 after transplantation, BM was isolated and lysed in 0.85% NH4Cl for 5 min. BM cells were resuspended in 10% DMSO in FBS and stored at −80 °C for further applications. BM cells were thawed and suspended in PBS supplemented with 2% FBS and stained with biotin anti-mouse Ly-6A/E (SCA1) (BioLegend), biotin anti-mouse CD127 (BioLegend, 135005), biotin anti-mouse CD3 (BioLegend, 100201), biotin anti-mouse TER-119/erythroid cells (BioLegend, 116203), biotin anti-mouse/human CD45R/B220 (BioLegend, 103203), BV605 anti-mouse GR1 (BioLegend, 108439), BV650 anti-mouse CD11b (BioLegend, 101239), PerCP/Cy5.5 anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (BioLegend, 101323), PE anti-mouse CD93 (BioLegend, 136503), APC anti-mouse CD48 (BioLegend, 103411), APC/Fire 750 anti-mouse CD117 (c-Kit) (BioLegend, 135139), Zombie aqua viability dye (BioLegend, 423101) and BV421 streptavidin (BioLegend, 405226). All the antibodies were used at a 1:400 dilution, apart from the viability dye, which was used at a 1:1,000 dilution. The samples were then stained with either anti-NPM1 (mAb2) antibody or the IgG2a isotype control (Bio X Cell, BE0085), precomplexed with anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 594 (Abcam, ab150108) as a secondary antibody. FMO controls were included in the experiments to provide a measure of spillover in each channel. This allows for correct gating in each experimental sample. Flow cytometry analysis was performed using the Cytek Aurora spectral analyzer and analyzed using FlowJo (version 10, BD). Data in this section were plotted using GraphPad Prism (version 9).

Primary antibodies, at a concentration of 0.5 μg per reaction, either anti-NPM1 (mAb2) or the IgG2a isotype control (Bio X Cell), were precomplexed with a 1:1,000 dilution of the secondary antibody goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (Abcam) for 30 min. A total of 5 × 104 cells for each model used in Fig. 6 (Fig. 6a,b,e,h) were blocked in 2% FBS in 1× PBS for 30 min on ice and then stained with the precomplexed mix of antibodies as stated above. Cells were washed once with 150 µl of 2% FBS in 1× PBS and resuspended in 2% FBS in 1× PBS containing 0.1 µg ml−1 DAPI (Sigma). Flow cytometry analysis was performed using the CytoFLEX instrument (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed using FlowJo (version 10, BD).

For the primary recipients (related to Fig. 4d,e and Extended Data Fig. 6c,d), 6–10-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were sublethally irradiated with a whole-body dose of 5.5 Gy and then injected with 106 primary murine AML cells by intravenous injection from the indicated animal AML model, as described above. On day 15 after transplantation, mice were treated i.p. with a single dose of either 5 mg kg−1 of mouse IgG2a isotype control antibody or 5 mg kg−1 of anti-NPM1 (mAb2) antibody.

Moreover, on day 18 after transplantation, PB from the tail vein as well as weight measurements of spleens, lungs and livers were taken from each animal after humane endpoints were reached.

All mice used in the study were housed in specific pathogen-free conditions in the UBS animal facilities of the University of Cambridge. All cages were on a 12–12-h light–dark cycle (lights on, 07:30) in a temperature-controlled and humidity-controlled room. Room temperature was maintained at 72 ± 2 °F (22.2 ± 1.1 °C), and room humidity was maintained at 30–70%. The animals were culled when leukemia-associated symptoms occurred or humane endpoints were reached. All animal studies were carried out in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, UK and approved by the Ethics Committee at the University of Cambridge. Randomization and blinding were not applied. All data in this section were plotted using GraphPad Prism (version 9).

For primary prostate carcinoma experiments related to Fig. 6c,d, 8–10-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were injected with 106 primary murine prostate carcinoma cells by subcutaneous injection (1:1 ratio of Matrigel and cancer cells) from the indicated animal model, as described above. For colorectal carcinoma experiments related to Fig. 6f,g, 8–10-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were injected with 5 × 105 MC38 cells by subcutaneous injection (1:1 ratio of Matrigel and cancer cells). For melanoma experiments related to Fig. 6i, 8–10-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were injected with 5 × 105 B16F10 cells by subcutaneous injection (1:1 ratio of Matrigel and cancer cells). On days 5, 7 and 9 after transplantation, mice were given i.p. injections of either anti-NPM1 (mAb2) or the IgG2a isotype control (Bio X Cell, BE0085) antibody at the indicated doses (total of three treatments). Tumors were dissected when sizes were approaching or reached the humane end point limit (1.2 cm2) as per animal license: on day 17 after transplantation for prostate tumors, on day 13 after transplantation for colorectal carcinoma tumors and on day 11 after transplantation for melanoma. All tumor sizes were measured using a digital caliper (Jodsen). All solid tumor models used in the study were housed in specific pathogen-free conditions in the UBS animal facilities of the University of Cambridge,. All cages were on a 12–12-hour light–dark cycle (lights on, 07:30) in a temperature-controlled and humidity-controlled room. Room temperature was maintained at 72 ± 2 °F (22.2 ± 1.1 °C), and room humidity was maintained at 30–70%. The animals were culled when humane endpoints were reached. All animal studies were carried out in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, UK and approved by the Ethics Committee at the University of Cambridge. Randomization and blinding were not applied. All data in this section were plotted using GraphPad Prism (version 9).

K562 cells were cultured as above. Cell surface protein labeling was accomplished using sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (APExBIO) as described above, after which crude membrane fractions were isolated. To obtain cytosolic and membrane fractions24, suspension cells were directly resuspended in membrane isolation buffer (10 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 250 mM sucrose (Sigma), 1 mM EDTA) at 5 million cells per 1 ml. Adherent cells were collected off the plate by scraping in ice-cold PBS, pelleted and then similarly resuspended at 5 million cells per 1 ml of membrane isolation buffer. Cells were rested on ice for up to 5 min, moved to a glass Dounce homogenizer (Sigma) and then homogenized using 40–80 strokes to obtain a resuspension of approximately 50% released nuclei. Overdouncing can cause nuclear rupture and contamination of the cytosolic fraction. After douncing, unbroken cells and nuclei were pelleted by centrifuging at 4 °C for 10 min at 700g. Supernatants (cytosol and membranes) were carefully transferred to a new tube, and pellets were discarded. The supernatants were again centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 10,000g. Most (90%) of the supernatant was removed and saved as cytosolic fractions. The remaining supernatant was discarded, as it was near to the membrane pellet. The membrane pellet was gently washed with 500 µl of ice-cold 1× PBS (the pellet was not resuspended here), the tube was centrifuged briefly, and all supernatant was discarded to leave a cleaned membrane pellet. Finally, the membrane pellet was resuspended in 500 µl CLIP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl (Sigma), 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.1% NP-40, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine). Both the cytosolic and membrane lysates were stored at −80 °C for later processing. After isolation and solubilization with CLIP lysis buffer, total protein quantification occurred using the BCA assay. For each sample, 5 μg protein was used for input, and 20 μg was used for either anti-NPM1 (FC8791)-coated bead protein A Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or streptavidin-coated bead (MyOne C1 beads, Thermo Fisher Scientific) enrichments. In both cases, 10 μl bead surrey was added to the membrane lysates in 100 μl of CLIP lysis buffer, and binding occurred at 4 °C for 16 h. After binding, the beads were washed three times with high-stringency buffer and then twice with 1× PBS. Proteins were released from the beads by heating at 85 °C for 10 min in 20 µl 1× LDS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1 mM free biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Input and enriched proteins were analyzed by Western blot, staining with anti-NPM1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-32256, FC8791) and streptavidin IR800 (LI-COR Biotechnology) and finally scanning on a LI-COR Odyssey CLx scanner. Fractionation as described above was performed without cell surface biotinylation for data in Fig. 1a, and western blots were developing using anti-NPM1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-32256, FC8791), anti-NPM1c (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 32-5200), anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-47778) and anti-RPN1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-48367) antibodies.

VH and VL sequences were grafted to the constant region of the mouse IgG2a heavy chain and the mouse λ light chain, respectively, to generate a new mouse antibody (mAb). These sequences were given to Curia Global. At Curia, the gene synthesis process involves overlapping oligonucleotide synthesis and assembly, followed by cloning into Curia's proprietary high-expression mammalian vector. Production and mAb quality control were performed by Curia to produce a protein A-purified IgG fraction with low endotoxin (<1 EU per mg IgG) in 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4.

Cells were cultured as described above and directly counted. Typically, 50,000 cells were used and blocked with Human TruStain FcX (Fc block, BioLegend) or Mouse TruStain FcX (Fc block, BioLegend) in flow cytometry buffer (0.5% BSA (Sigma) in 1× PBS) for at least 15 min on ice; cells were kept on ice from this point forward. For intracellular staining (‘fix–perm'), cells were first fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min at 25 °C, rinsed once with 1× PBS and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 10 min at 25 °C and finally rinsed once with 1× PBS. For cell surface staining (‘live cell'), cells were processed directly after live Fc blocking on ice. Precomplexed antibodies were added to live or fixed cells. To precomplex, primary unconjugated antibodies including mouse isotype (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2025) and anti-NPM1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-32256, FC8791) and anti-Ty1 tag (Diagenode) were bound in solution (precomplexed) to a goat anti-mouse AF647 secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A32728) or a goat anti-mouse AF488 secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A28175) for at least 30 min on ice before use. The molar ratio was 2:1 (primary:secondary). To the blocked cells, precomplexed antibody was added at a final concentration of 1 µg ml−1 (primary antibody) and allowed to bind to cells for 60 min on ice. After staining, cells were centrifuged at 4 °C for 3 min at 400g, and the supernatant was discarded. All cell centrifugation steps took place using these conditions. Cells were washed once with 150 µl flow cytometry buffer, centrifuged under the same conditions and finally resuspended in flow cytometry buffer containing 0.1 µg ml−1 DAPI. Data collection occurred on a BD Biosciences LSRFortessa 3, and a gating strategy was used to isolate live single cells to examine antibody binding using FlowJo software (version 10, BD).

The frozen PB and BM samples obtained from healthy donors as well as patients with AML were processed with care to ensure as little cell lysis and high viability after thawing. Vials were warmed in a 37 °C water bath for 2–3 min and then completely thawed in 5 ml of ice-cold flow cytometry buffer. Cells were pelleted from this initial resuspension at 400g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and cells were resuspended in 1 ml of fresh ice-cold flow cytometry buffer and counted. For each sample, 1 million cells per ml were taken for Fc blocking and staining according to the above protocol. Next, we stained the cells using the live protocol with the precomplexed isotype or anti-NPM1 (mAb2) antibodies for 30 min on ice in 100 µl flow cytometry buffer. After that, we centrifuged the cells and discarded the supernatant as before. The cells were then stained again with 200 ng of dye-conjugated cell type-specific antibodies (anti-human CD45 (HI30), 304024; anti-human CD34 (581), 343516; anti-human CD117 (104D2), 313204; anti-human CD33 (WM53), 303416; anti-human CD13 (WM15), 301710; anti-human HLA-DR (L243), 307604; anti-human CD3 (OKT3), 317308; and/or anti-human CD19 (HIB19), 302206; all BioLegend) on ice for 30 min in 100 µl flow cytometry buffer. Finally, the cells were pelleted again, the supernatant was discarded, one 200-µl flow cytometry buffer wash was performed, and the cells were finally resuspended in 200 µl flow cytometry buffer with 0.1 µg ml−1 DAPI for flow cytometry analysis. Healthy donor and AML patient samples were obtained with informed consent under (1) UK ethical approval (IRAS reference 340167, previously 149581, REC 07-MRE05-44). Additionally, healthy donor and AML patient samples were collected from patients located at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) or Brigham and Women's Hospital (USA). Samples were then processed and banked in the Pasquarello Tissue Bank in accordance with IRB-22-160 at the DFCI; we obtained assistance from the Hematologic Malignancies Data Repository to identify patient samples from the tissue bank that were bona fide AML. The HMDR also provided relevant information regarding disease characteristics, such as cytogenetics, mutations and immunophenotype. Samples were banked in accordance with DFCI Protocol 01-206: tissue and data collection for research studies in patients with hematologic malignancies, BM disorders and normal donors. Sample characteristics were obtained using DFCI IRB Protocol 22-160. This is a DFCI-specific tissue-banking protocol, which is not available publicly for review, but it can be shared upon request.

For suspension cells, culturing, counting and Fc blocking were carried out as described above. Samples for ‘live cell' imaging were processed according to the live cell flow cytometry protocol noted above; however, after staining and washing, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (37% stock, Sigma) for 30 min at 25 °C. Primary and secondary antibodies noted above were used but sequentially, rather than precomplexed: primary antibody was added at a final concentration of 2.5 µg ml−1 for 45 min on ice in flow cytometry buffer. After staining, cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and then stained with a secondary antibody at a final concentration of 2.5 µg ml−1. Secondary stains occurred for 30 min on ice and in the dark, after which cells were washed once with 1× PBS. A final fixation for ‘fix–perm' samples was performed in parallel with the ‘live cell' samples with 3.7% formaldehyde in 1× PBS for 30 min at 25 °C in the dark. Nuclei were stained with 0.1 µg ml−1 DAPI in flow cytometry buffer for 15 min at 25 °C. Suspension cells were applied to glass slides using a Cytospin centrifuge (Fisher Scientific): this was accomplished by centrifugation at 500g for 5 min in a Cytospin 1867. Finally, cells were mounted in ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and a coverglass was sealed over the sample with nail polish. All samples were then imaged on a Leica TCS SP8 STED ONE microscope. For all experiments, at least three regions of interest were acquired using a ×63 oil-immersion objective across one or more z slices. Leica's line-sequential scanning method was used, and images were acquired at 1,024-by-1,024 resolution with a pinhole size of 1 AU. The DAPI channel was acquired with a PMT detector, while all other channels were imaged using hybrid detectors. For Extended Data Fig. 2i, the DAPI channel was imaged using a hybrid detector, and images were analyzed using ImageJ (version 1.54f). Next, using Imaris Microscopy Image Analysis software (Oxford Instruments), single slices of the confocal stack were analyzed.

Cells were prepared as described above for live cell imaging. Here, primary conjugated antibodies (AF647) were used directly for cell labeling and included mouse isotype (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-24636-AF647) and anti-NPM1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-32256-AF647, FC8791). To avoid cell movement during the SR acquisition, cells were immobilized on a glass-bottom plate precoated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma, P4707) and Cell-Tak (Corning, 354240). An overview of the method and processing can be found in Extended Data Fig. 3a. For single-molecule SR microscopy, we used direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy. To perform this, the PBS in which the cells were stored was replaced by a reducing oxygen scavenging buffer to induce blinking of fluorophores as described in the literature59. The blinking buffer consisted of 2 μl ml−1 catalase (Sigma), 10% (wt/vol) glucose (BD Biosciences), 100 mM Tris-HCl (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 560 μg ml−1 glucose oxidase (Sigma) and 20 mM cysteamine (Sigma). First, diffraction-limited images were obtained with low-intensity illumination of few W cm−2. Next, the laser power was increased to approximately 3 kW cm−2. Image acquisition was started after a short delay to ensure that most fluorophores were shelved into a dark state. The exposure time was 50 ms, and approximately 40,000 frames were recorded.

As the data were obtained with an sCMOS camera, which typically exhibit few pixels with deviating sensitivity (‘hot' and ‘cold' pixels), the obtained single-molecule data were corrected for individual pixels with abnormally high or low sensitivity first60. In total, 4,000 frames of a raw data stack were averaged. Hot and cold pixels, which are a systematic deviation, persist, in contrast to the random single-molecule signals. Each pixel was compared to its neighbors using 8-connectivity. If a deviation of more than 3% from the median of the neighboring pixel was observed, a correction factor that set the pixel to the median of its neighbors was recorded as previously described61. Otherwise, the pixel was not considered to be significantly brighter or darker. This yielded a correction mask, which was applied to all frames of the raw data. Finally, the no-light counts were subtracted from the pixel-corrected data.

For localization of single molecules, the Fiji plugin ThunderSTORM was used62. Each camera frame was filtered with a B-spline filter of order 3 and scale 2. Local maxima, corresponding to single-molecule signals, were detected with eight-neighborhood connectivity and a threshold of 1.1 or 1.2 times the standard deviation of the first wavelet level. Detected local maxima were fitted with a 2D Gaussian using least squares, and the position was recorded. Next, to account for single-molecule signals being active in multiple frames, merging of localizations was performed, using a maximum distance of 30 nm and a maximum of 5 off frames with no limit regarding on frames. Cross-correlation-based drift correction (magnification, 5; bin size, 5) was performed, followed by filtering of localizations (sigma of the point spread function between 60 and 270 nm, intensity below 37,800 photons, localization uncertainty smaller than 30 nm). For visualization, the final localizations were reconstructed as 2D histograms with a magnification of 5 (corresponding to a pixel size of 17.7 nm).

For cluster analysis, an automated pipeline was established using the raw list of localizations. First, Ripley's H function was calculated on three areas with a large number of well-separated clusters. The resulting preferential cluster size from the three areas (which was, notably, always very similar) was averaged, multiplied by a correction factor of 0.45 and used as the seed radius for the following DBSCAN analysis. This DBSCAN script yielded all individual clusters, the total number of clusters, the average number of points per cluster and the spatial relation between clusters. The identified final clusters were then analyzed with respect to their spatial relation, size and number of localizations. This unbiased approach follows recommended analysis procedures recently described63. Crucially, each dataset was subjected to identical postprocessing and cluster analysis steps with no manual intervention, thus avoiding any biases arising from different parameter settings. Custom scripts used for this analysis can be shared upon request.

Samples were prepared similarly to the flow cytometry workflow as described above. However, rather than dye-conjugated secondaries, here an HRP-conjugated secondary (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 31430) was used. The isotype (control) or anti-NPM1 (FC8791) (target) primary unconjugated antibody was precomplexed with an appropriate secondary HRP antibody at 2:1 (primary:secondary) for at least 30 min on ice. Cells were grown as biological triplicate cultures, and typically 2.5 million cells were used per replicate per labeling experiment. Cells were collected from culture, washed of culture medium and resuspended on ice-cold flow cytometry buffer to which the Fc blocker was added for at least 15 min. After blocking, cells were adjusted to 1 million cells per ml of flow cytometry buffer, and then the precomplexed antibodies were added for staining at a final concentration of 2.5 µg ml−1. Staining occurred for 60 min at 4 °C on rotation, after which cells were pelleted, supernatants were discarded and cells were washed once with ice-cold 1× PBS. This wash is important to remove excess BSA in the flow cytometry buffer. Next, cells were gently but quickly resuspended in 980 µl of 100 µM biotin-phenol (Iris Biotech) in 1× PBS at 25 °C. To this, 10 µl of 100 mM H2O2 (Sigma-Aldrich) was quickly added, tubes were capped and inverted, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 min at 25 °C. Precisely after 2 min, the samples were quenched by adding sodium azide and sodium ascorbate at a final concentration of 5 mM and 10 mM, respectively. Samples were inverted, and cells were pelleted at 4 °C. Samples were then washed sequentially once with ice-cold flow cytometry buffer and then twice with ice-cold 1× PBS, after which cell pellets were lysed in 500 µl CLIP lysis buffer, briefly sonicated to solubilize chromatin and frozen at −80 °C for later processing.

Once all the proximity labeling was complete, lysates were thawed in batches to perform the following steps in parallel. Total protein amounts were quantified using the BCA assay, and labeling efficiency and consistency were checked using western blotting. For biotin enrichment, we used the streptavidin western QC to determine the biotin signal across all samples first and then calculated the total µg of lysate that was needed from that sample to generate 5,000,000 units of streptavidin IR800 signal on the LI-COR system. This µg value was then used as the input mass for each of the replicates across all the proximity labeling samples for biotin capture and MS preparation. Samples were normalized to a final volume of 500 µl with CLIP lysis buffer, and, to each sample, 100 µl Pierce NeutrAvidin Agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added, and samples were incubated at 4 °C for 4 h on rotation. Beads were then washed twice with 1 ml of high-stringency buffer and twice with 1 ml of 4 M NaCl in 100 mM HEPES, all at 37 °C. Salts and detergents were then rinsed from the beads by sequentially washing twice with 1 ml 1× PBS, twice with 1 ml of LC–MS-grade water (Fisher Scientific) and finally with 1 ml of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. An on-bead trypsin digestion was then set up by adding 200 µl of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 1 µg MS-grade trypsin to each sample and incubating for 16 h at 37 °C with occasional shaking. After digestion, the samples were acidified by adding formic acid at a final concentration of 0.5%. The solution containing released peptides was moved to a new tube, and the beads were rinsed twice with 300 µl LC–MS-grade water to capture any remaining peptides. All elution and wash samples for a given replicate were combined and reduced to a volume of <200 µl with a SpeedVac. Samples were then desalted using a C18 spin column (Thermo Fisher Scientific): preconditioned with 50% methanol in water and washed twice with 5% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid in water, the sample was bound twice to the column, and then the columns were washed four times with 0.5% formic acid in water. Finally, peptides were eluted into Protein LoBind tubes (Eppendorf) with two applications of 40 µl of 70% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid in water. Organic solvents were removed with a SpeedVac, and samples were fully dried with a lyophilizer. Resulting peptides were analyzed on the timsTOF Pro as described above.

For all peptides generated, we followed the same procedure for MS analysis and peptide database searching. Specifically, a nanoElute was attached in line to a timsTOF Pro equipped with a CaptiveSpray Source (Bruker). Chromatography was conducted at 40 °C through a 25-cm reversed-phase C18 column (PepSep) at a constant flow rate of 0.5 µl min−1. Mobile phase A was 98% water, 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid (vol/vol/vol), and phase B was acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (vol/vol). During a 108-min method, peptides were separated by a three-step linear gradient (5% to 30% B over 90 min, 30% to 35% B over 10 min, 35% to 95% B over 4 min), followed by a 4-min isocratic flush at 95% for 4 min before washing and a return to low organic conditions. Experiments were run as data-dependent acquisitions with ion mobility activated in PASEF mode. MS and MS/MS spectra were collected with m/z 100 to 1,700, and ions with z = +1 were excluded. Raw data files were searched using PEAKS Online Xpro 1.7 (Bioinformatics Solutions). The precursor mass error tolerance and fragment mass error tolerance were set to 20 ppm and 0.03, respectively. The trypsin digest mode was set to semi-specific, and missed cleavages were set to 3. The human Swiss-Prot reviewed (canonical) database version 2020_05 (downloaded from UniProt) and the common Repository of Adventitious Proteins (cRAP version 1.0, downloaded from the Global Proteome Machine Organization) totaling 20,487 entries were used. Carbamidomethylation was selected as a fixed modification. Oxidation (M), deamidation (NQ) and acetylation (N terminus) were selected as variable modifications. Raw data files and searched datasets are available on the Mass Spectrometry Interactive Virtual Environment (MassIVE), a full member of the ProteomeXchange Consortium, under the identifier MSV000092211. The complete searched datasets are also available in Supplementary Information.

To identify enriched proteins from these datasets, we took an approach that compared enrichment in the NPM1 to that of isotype antibodies. Results of the database search were first purged of non-human proteins and keratins as previously described. All proteins with fewer than two unique peptides were also filtered out of the list. Next, Excel was used to calculate the mean spectral count for each of the remaining proteins across triplicates. For each protein, the mean spectral counts associated with each antibody probe were divided by the mean spectral counts of the corresponding isotype, creating an enrichment factor of each protein in the proximity labeling over the isotype. Python (version 3.13) was then used to calculate the ratio of total protein isolated from proximity labeling with protein-targeting antibodies divided by that collected with isotype antibodies. Proteins from each set of proximity labeling data with enrichments either less than two or the previously described ratio were filtered from the dataset. The resultant lists comprise the hits associated with each round of proximity labeling. To perform GO term analysis, all proteins observed across all four fractions from each cell line were concatenated, creating a list of background proteins from each of the four cell lines tested. Lists of hits from the membrane hit pulldowns from each cell line were submitted to DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) and run against their respective backgrounds. Next, for each category of GO term (BP, CC and MF), the union of the top four terms across all cell lines and their associated sizes and Benjamini values were plotted for comparison of enrichment across cell lines.

OCI-AML3 cells were collected, washed with flow cytometry buffer and resuspended at 106 cells per ml. They were then blocked with Human TruStain FcX for 15 min with 5 µl of Fc block per million cells. They were washed again afterward. The cells were then partitioned for live cell and fixed cell staining. Cells planned for fixation were stained with 1 µl of fixable violet LIVE/DEAD stain per 106 cells per ml for 30 min. Afterward, cells were washed with flow cytometry buffer and resuspended in 4% PFA for 10 min at room temperature. They were washed with flow cytometry buffer and then resuspended in 0.1% Triton X for 5 min at room temperature. Again, the cells were washed with flow cytometry buffer. Live cells and fixed cells were then incubated with 500 ng FC8791–Alexa Fluor 647 in 100 µl for 30 min. Cells were washed twice afterward, and live cells were finally resuspended in DAPI. For molecular counting, Quantum Alexa Fluor 647 molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome beads were used from Bangs Labs. All samples were analyzed on the BD LSRFortessa. Standard curves were generated and fluorescence quantitation was performed as per Bang Labs' QuickCal analysis tool.

Samples were prepared here in a similar manner as described above for the proximity labeling of proteins with key differences. The HRP-conjugated secondary antibody was exchanged for protein A–HRP (Cell Signaling) and used at the same molar ratio: two primary antibodies per one protein A–HRP molecule. The biotinylation reagent used here was biotin-aniline (Iris Biotech); it was used at a final concentration of 200 µM in 1× PBS for the labeling reaction, and the labeling reaction was allowed to proceed for 3 min at 25 °C. After pelleting the cells from the quenching reaction, cells were directly lysed, and total RNA was isolated as described before25. Briefly, RNAzol RT (Molecular Research Center) was used to lyse cell pellets by placing the samples at 50 °C and shaking for 5 min. To phase separate the RNA, 0.4× volumes of water was added, and samples were vortexed, allowed to stand for 5 min at 25 °C and lastly centrifuged at 12,000g at 4 °C for 15 min. The aqueous phase was transferred to clean tubes, and 1.1× volumes of isopropanol was added. The RNA was then purified over a Zymo column (Zymo Research). For all column cleanups, we used the following protocol. First, 350 μl of pure water was added to each column, samples were centrifuged at 10,000g for 30 s, and the flowthrough was discarded. Next, precipitated RNA from the RNAzol RT extraction (or binding buffer precipitated RNA, below) was added to the columns, which were centrifuged at 10,000g for 10–20 s, and the flowthrough was discarded. This step was repeated until all the precipitated RNA was passed over the column once. Next, the column was washed three times in total: once using 400 μl RNA Prep Buffer (3 M guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) in 80% ethanol) and twice with 400 μl 80% ethanol. The first two centrifugation steps were at 10,000g for 20 s, and the last one was for 30 s. RNA was then treated with proteinase K (Ambion) on the column. Proteinase K was diluted 1:19 in water and added directly to the column matrix and then allowed to incubate on the column at 37 °C for 45 min. The column top was sealed with either a cap or Parafilm to prevent evaporation. After the digestion, the columns were brought to room temperature for 5 min; lowering the temperature is important before proceeding. Next, eluted RNA was centrifuged out into fresh tubes, and a second elution with water was performed. The mucinase StcE (1.5 μg for every 50 μl of RNA, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the eluate, and samples were placed at 37 °C for 30 min to digest. The RNA was then cleaned up again using a Zymo column. Here, 2× RNA Binding Buffer (Zymo Research) was added, samples were vortexed for 10 s, and then 2× (samples + buffer) of 100% ethanol was added, and samples were vortexed for 10 s. The final RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop. In vitro RNase or sialidase digestions took place by digesting 50 μg total RNA with one of the following: nothing, 4 μl RNase Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or 4 μl of α2-3,6,8,9-neuraminidase A (NEB) in 1× NEB Glyco Buffer 1 (NEB) for 60 min at 37 °C. After digestion, RNA was purified using a Zymo column as noted above and was then ready for gel analysis.

To visualize the labeled RNA, it was run on a denaturing agarose gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and stained with streptavidin25. After elution from the column as described above, the RNA was combined with 12 μl of Gel Loading Buffer II (95% formamide (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 18 mM EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.025% SDS) with a final concentration of 1× SYBR Gold (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and denatured at 55 °C for 10 min. It is important to not use Gel Loading Buffer II with dyes. Immediately after this incubation, the RNA was placed on ice for at least 2 min. The samples were then loaded into a 1% agarose, 0.75% formaldehyde, 1.5× MOPS Buffer (Lonza) denaturing gel. Precise and consistent pouring of these gels is critical to ensure a similar thickness of the gel for accurate transfer conditions; we aim for solidified gels approximately 1 cm thick. RNA was electrophoresed in 1× MOPS at 115 V for between 34 and 45 min, depending on the length of the gel. Subsequently, the RNA was visualized with a UV gel imager, and excess gel was cut away; leaving ~0.75 cm of gel around the outer edges of sample lanes will improve transfer accuracy. The RNA was transferred with 3 M NaCl, pH 1 (with HCl) to a nitrocellulose membrane for 90 min at 25 °C. After transfer, the membrane was rinsed with 1× PBS and dried on Whatman paper (GE Healthcare). Dried membranes were rehydrated in Intercept Protein-Free Blocking Buffer, TBS (LI-COR Biosciences) for 30 min at 25 °C. After blocking, the membranes were stained using streptavidin IR800 (LI-COR Biosciences) diluted 1:5,000 in Intercept blocking buffer for 30 min at 25 °C. Excess streptavidin IR800 was washed from the membranes using three washes with 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma) in 1× PBS for 3 min each at 25 °C. The membranes were then briefly rinsed with PBS to remove the Tween-20 before scanning. Membranes were scanned on a LI-COR Odyssey CLx scanner (LI-COR Biosciences).

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly transforming medical applications. However, proprietary models such as GPT-4o face significant barriers to clinical adoption because they cannot be deployed on site within healthcare institutions, making them non-compliant with stringent privacy regulations. Recent advancements in open-source LLMs such as DeepSeek models offer a promising alternative since they allow efficient fine-tuning on local data in hospitals with advanced IT infrastructure. To demonstrate the clinical utility of DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1, we benchmarked their performance on clinical decision support tasks against proprietary LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental. Using 125 patient cases with sufficient statistical power, covering a broad range of frequent and rare diseases, we found that DeepSeek models perform equally well and in some cases better than proprietary LLMs. Our study demonstrates that open-source LLMs can provide a scalable pathway for secure model training enabling real-world medical applications in accordance with data privacy and healthcare regulations.

The best smart locks can help anyone who constantly misplaces keys or who frequently wonders whether they locked the front door. I am in the latter camp. After years in apartments, I recently moved to a large enough house that checking whether the door is locked can feel like a chore, especially once I'm all cozy in bed.

Installing a smart lock doesn't mean throwing away your house keys—you probably still want to bring them with you. These locks are all about convenience, offering multiple ways to enter, like a passcode via a keypad, fingerprint scanning, or through an app. You can easily share codes with friends and family, so no need to fuss with crappy key copies, and you can usually set them to auto-lock when the door closes. But there are a lot of models out there, and not all will work with your door. Don't worry, I've been testing smart locks for nearly a year and have lots of advice in this guide. Most folks will be happy with our top pick, the Yale Approach Lock with Keypad Touch, but we have several options—even a lock that fits a sliding door.

Before You Buy a Smart Lock

Here's a few things to check before you purchase a smart lock.

How thick is your door? Yes, you need to measure how thick your front door is. If it's close to or more than 2 inches thick, you might need some kind of expansion kit, like the Ultraloq Thick Door Kit for the company's smart locks, designed for doors between 1.75 and 2.5 inches. My door is on the thicker side, and while I could install most locks like the Lockly Visage and Aqara U50 no problem, a lock from Kwikset needed an expansion kit. Once you know your door size, you can check it against your lock of choice to see if it'll fit and if you need any expansion tools. You don't want to get started only to find out you need to order something extra.

Will you need a bridge or a hub? Some locks, like those from Yale, have a separate Wi-Fi bridge that needs to be plugged in nearby. Companies like Aqara and Abode have hubs you'll need to set up to get more features. But some models don't require a hub or bridge at all. Double-check if there's anything extra you need and if it has to be plugged in close to your door. Do you have an outlet readily available?

Can you switch out your whole lock? If you're a homeowner, than you can (probably) buy any of these locks without having to worry. But renters or folks with a strict set of homeowner's association rules might find that they can't change their lock as freely. Depending on your freedom, there's both full lock replacements, which will replace your entire front door lock, and retrofit locks, which only replace the backing. Retrofit is a great option if you don't want new keys or don't want to tip off your landlord you changed out the backing.

Tools You'll Want for Installation

Your specific lock of choice might have more requirements, but for each lock I installed, I found myself using:

Most locks do not recommend using a power drill out of risk of damaging the lock. The precision tool kit might sound silly if you've already got a screwdriver, but many of these locks use tiny screws that are much easier to control with a precision tool kit.

Double-check if batteries are included so that you're ready to pop them in after the installation.

Yale's lock might look like it's a full lock replacement, but this is a retrofit design that only changes out the back of your thumb-turn dead bolt. That means your existing keys will still work, and everyone outside of your house will have no idea that it's smart. It's ideal for renters, but also nice for anyone who doesn't want to switch out their front lock and swap keys. All of that also means installation was fast and easy—the hardest part is keeping your existing lock from falling to the ground while you swap out the backing, but it only takes a few minutes to complete.

As its name suggests, the Yale Approach Lock (8/10, WIRED Recommends) can sense when you approach. It uses your phone's location to do this, and within the app, you place a small range to establish what counts as you “arriving” home. I have a patio and a small staircase between my door and my car, so I made a larger range that could sense me once I hit the staircase. That worked better than placing the range on the center of my home, since it wouldn't count me as arriving until I was already at the door.

Yale's parent company, Assa Abloy, acquired smart-lock brand August back in 2017, and if you've ever used an August lock before, then the included Wi-Fi bridge will look familiar. The bridge connects to the smart lock via Bluetooth, so it has to be plugged in close to your door. This is what connects the lock to Wi-Fi for remote unlock functionality (plus other features). The whole setup is pretty similar to how August's locks have worked in the past, though I like the design of the Yale Approach better than the silver cylinder of the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock.

You can choose to get a keypad for the Approach, and there are two different styles to choose from. The basic Keypad bundle includes Yale's numerical Keypad, but the biometric Keypad Touch bundle has the numerical keypad and a fingerprint scanner. I recommend upgrading to the fingerprint reader—it's insanely convenient and fast. Just a single touch and your door is unlocked. You can also purchase the lock without a keypad ($130) if you don't have anywhere to place it, but keypads are a great addition to a smart lock, so that you can give out guest and temporary codes, and it also allows you to get inside without your keys or phone.

If you thought the fingerprint reader on the above Yale Approach sounded handy, then let me introduce you to the Lockly Visage (8/10, WIRED Recommends). Not only does the Visage have a fingerprint reader, but it has built-in sensors to recognize your face to unlock the door as you walk up. That's right, this lock can see you coming.

When installing this lock, I recommend moving fast when you get to the battery stage. Don't put in the rechargeable battery until you've downloaded the app, located the activation card inside the box (keep this safe in case you ever reset the lock), and are prepared to finish the in-app setup steps, specifically the Visage ID—Lockly's face-recognition tech. The battery activates a Bluetooth signal that was only live for a few minutes in my testing, and you'll need to input the code and finish the steps in that amount of time. Restarting it over and over is frustrating, but possible. Lockly says it has pushed an update to fix this short-lived Bluetooth window, but I'd still plan to be ready to roll once you put in the battery.

Once set up, I had zero connection issues and was happy with how quickly this lock could recognize my face as I walked up (even with sunglasses on!) or how quickly it could read my fingerprint. The Visage uses infrared (IR) sensors and a camera to see when a person is approaching and who they are. The sensors in the lock have both live-body detection and face recognition, so it isn't spoofed by pictures. The infrared sensors have about a 2.6-foot range, and I did find that to feel accurate in my tests. The company promises no stills are captured, and the live face-tracking data is encrypted and is saved on-device. It's nice to have both the face and fingerprint options, so members of your household can choose whatever they prefer. There's also a keypad and a regular mechanical key, with two keys included.

The Visage Zeno uses the Lockly Home app (iOS, Android), Lockly's newest app. It works specifically with the Zeno line. There's another Lockly app that will work with this lock, but it doesn't look as nice. Within the app, you can easily generate codes for guests, customize notifications, and set up preferences, like having your door automatically lock after a certain amount of time.

A door sensor also sticks to your door below the lock, and a second part sits on the door jamb to sense whether or not the door is closed. You can customize notifications around that as well, and it's a nice add-on, though the whole system isn't the most attractive on the door itself—it's a little cluttered.

The day I moved into my home, I realized the previous owner had not left me any keys for the sliding glass door that opens into my backyard. I reached out, and she … did not have them anymore. Great! I wanted to smarten up my home anyway, so I searched long and hard for smart locks built for sliding doors—very few options exist. But I came across The Connected Shop, which was exactly what I was looking for (but super expensive). The company sent me the Next Gen Smart Lock to try, which I've used for over a year and has functioned almost flawlessly in that time. Seriously, I've only recharged the USB-C battery once in that time.

Fair warning, the instructions are complicated. You may be able to do it yourself, but I could not. The Connected Shop's technician had to cut a part of the strike plate on my existing hardware to get it to latch. He also had to drill new holes into my sliding door frame, and in the process, he accidentally shattered the glass in the door. Welp! A representative says if it happened to a customer, the company would take care of it and replace the glass as it did mine. I highly recommend contacting the company and sending a picture of your lock if you have concerns about door compatibility.

Once installed, you may find yourself, as I did, riffling through the manual to initially set up users, codes, fingerprints, and the app connectivity. (The manual is needlessly complicated.) That process involves inputting a code, then pressing the right numbers to get to the settings you need. There's no real need to connect it to the third-party Tuya Smart app (Android, iOS), because, annoyingly, you can't set up codes, fingerprints, or users in the app. It's mostly for deleting members, creating temporary passwords, and seeing unlock or doorbell notifications. It's also where you can view battery life. (The company says you can remotely unlock over Wi-Fi in the app, but this only works when someone rings the doorbell, which is a little bizarre.)

There's a lock and unlock button on the inside of the door, along with a manual knob, and a removable battery with a USB-C port for charging (again, I roughly have nine months on a single charge), though this will depend on how frequently you use your sliding glass door. It's how I get to my backyard, so I do not use it as often as my front door. There is no handle, so I slide my door by pushing the side of the lock, which juts out from the door frame.

On the other end, you tap anywhere in the middle to have the number pad light up. There's a doorbell function, though it's hard to hear if you're not in the lock's vicinity. Just type in the code and press the unlock button, and that's it. I predominantly use the fingerprint unlock, which works reliably once you get used to placing your finger on the sensor in a particular way. The Connected Shop also throws in two NFC tags—I leave one on my keychain—as a backup unlocking method, and there are two physical keys just in case (I have never used them).

The only thing that has not worked is the company's so-called Face Unlock. I've tried to set it up multiple times, and it always fails when it tries to scan my face. Honestly, I don't care for this feature. If you don't either, there's a slightly cheaper Sliding Door Smart Lock Knob that is similar but lacks the camera, though it takes four AAA batteries instead.

My only main concern is with the company itself. It's fairly new (founded in 2021), so it's not well established, and I can't vouch for its customer service. (The people I interacted with were nice, but I'm also reviewing the company, so of course they were nice.) Its product pages could stand to use more information like encryption standards and water resistance ratings, and I didn't find the company's manuals very helpful. I'm not sure why the company doesn't have its own app yet, and it claims support for Alexa and Google Home, but when I tried connecting the Tuya app to the latter, it didn't bring over the lock.

That said, the Next Gen Smart Lock's build quality is exceptional and far nicer than I was expecting, and it's operating better than I expected. —Julian Chokkattu

Not every door you want locked has a dead bolt. If you've got a side door or interior door you wish you could easily lock with a code, then a smart lever lock is what you need. These will replace a regular doorknob with one that not only has a key, but also some smarts and a keypad.

I've tried a couple of these, and so far, I prefer the Aqara U300. The lock feels well built and isn't difficult to install, similar to the Aqara U50 (see below). The included measuring tools help you set the door jamb to the right length, and you can follow along with a video on YouTube or within the Aqara app. It came with four AA batteries, plus two physical keys, and you'll use the app to set up both a code for the keypad and load fingerprints for the fingerprint reader on the door handle. For the fingerprint reader, make sure your finger fills the entire round scanner, or else it'll scold you (I have small hands and ended up only loading my thumbs to make filling the reader easier.) You can also open this handle with an NFC card and an Apple Home Key.

This lock is Matter compatible, meaning it will play nicely with all the smart home ecosystems, whether you're using Alexa, HomeKit, or Google Home. The catch is you need some kind of a Thread border router in your home for the Matter network—this can be an existing device like a Google Home Hub (2nd Gen) or an Apple HomePod Mini. I used the Aqara M3 Hub, but the U300 really wanted to bind with my HomeKit setup via Matter rather than its own hub. Aqara confirmed this shouldn't happen, and if you don't have HomeKit set up like I do, you probably won't have the same issue. You can set up the lock via Bluetooth too, with entry options on your phone, and unlock or lock the door.

We use this smart lock for my sister's interior door to her room, which she rents on our first floor. Within the Aqara app, she immediately adjusted the settings to put the lock on Do Not Disturb Mode to keep the built-in voice prompter from talking. (She said it was too loud, and I agree, especially when it's in your bedroom instead of an entryway). She also set it to never auto-lock so that she can come and go without needing to unlock it every time. It was easy to invite her to control my Aqara devices within the app once she made her account.

You're probably thinking, the door to get into the garage. You're wrong. I mean the actual garage. My garage is controlled by a MyQ Smart Garage Opener (8/10, WIRED Recommends), and it's been a huge life improvement for the anxiously minded couple like myself and my husband. Worried whether the garage door is open after the scramble to play The Wiggles for our son while navigating the neighborhood? No problem, check the MyQ app. I've even set up the MyQ app to alert me if my garage stays open for more than 10 minutes. It's a peace of mind, especially if your garage is a more frequently used access point to your home than the front door.

I wish I could tell you about the installation, but my house came with the MyQ Garage Door Opener (starting at $200, depending on the model) professionally installed (along with some other smart tech, with mixed results). It's the best feature my house came with. The openers are always professionally installed, and you'll have to contact a local technician to get one. But you can get the much cheaper MyQ Smart Garage Controller to add onto any garage, turning an existing opener into a smart one.

If you wish you had a keypad for your garage, you can add that with the MyQ Video Keypad. It acts as both a keypad to open your garage (a great option if you tend to forget your phone) and a video doorbell feed that goes straight to your phone. The only issues I had with it were that it was heavy—command strips won't work, you'll need to drill it into your home's exterior. The video feed also wasn't always reliable, thanks to the lackluster Wi-Fi in my driveway. Test it with a laptop beforehand if that's a feature you want (or perhaps add a Wi-Fi extender to your garage).

MyQ compatibility with other ecosystems focuses more on vehicles and security devices than it does on classic smart home assistants, which makes sense since you're usually controlling it from outside of the home. It works with Amazon Key and Walmart+ InHome to get deliveries in your garage, with Ring, plus several cars, and IFTTT.

Ultraloq Bolt Fingerprint

Ultraloq Bolt Fingerprint for $170: I have now tested three different Ultraloq smart locks over a year and a half, and while I think the company offers excellent hardware for the money, there are just a few too many software quirks that put these locks a rung below our top picks. I first began with the Bolt Fingerprint, which has been the most reliable of all the Ultraloq smart locks so far. If you have a standard door with a borehole for the dead bolt, it'll be quick to install (Ultraloq has a Thick Door Kit). I initially had several issues getting the lock to connect to my Wi-Fi, but after multiple attempts and a few choice words, it connected. I've had no connectivity problems since. The app isn't the prettiest, but it's functional. You can add multiple user profiles, remotely unlock, get notifications when the doors are unlocked, share codes, and register fingerprints. There's even an auto-unlock function for when you walk up to the door, but I found it a little inconsistent and left it turned off. The fingerprint sensor is the highlight after all. You have to get used to placing your finger on the sensor a specific way, and after doing this a few times, I've now got it down so that I almost always unlock on the first try. It comes with a door sensor, so when the door closes, it will automatically lock (you can disable this if you want).

The next lock I tested was the Ultraloq Bolt Fingerprint with Wi-Fi and HomeKit. This one did a better job connecting to my home's Wi-Fi network through the U-Home app and was even quick to add to my Google Home. Unfortunately, after several months of flawless performance, one day it decided to start rejecting my fingerprint. The problem? When I put my fingerprint on the scanner, it denied it and then blocked all other methods of unlocking except the app (or the physical key that's included). This was so annoying that I just stuck to using a numerical code with the keypad. Finally, I recently switched to the Bolt Fingerprint With Matter, and let's just say I'm still diagnosing issues with the company. The lock decides to stop working after a few hours, forcing me to remove one of the batteries and put it back in to “reactivate” it. I might just have a defective unit, so we'll see. —Julian Chokkattu

Aqara U50 for $110: I really like the Aqara U50 (7/10, WIRED Reviews), especially since it's quick to install and affordable. The downside is you need a hub like the Aqara M3 ($129) to connect it to Wi-Fi, which costs more than the lock itself. It's best if you're going to invest in more Aqara devices around your house, or if you don't want Wi-Fi control and want to generate your own codes and set up minor automations, like auto-locking after a certain amount of time.

Defiant Smart Deadbolt

Defiant Smart Deadbolt Powered by Hubspace for $100: The shoddy build quality is a huge turn-off on this smart lock from Defiant. The buttons are mushy, it's very loud, and what is the point of Wi-Fi connectivity if it never connects to Wi-Fi? I finally got it paired with the Hubspace app, but the lock never stayed connected to my Wi-Fi, so I had none of the benefits. —Julian Chokkattu

Eufy FamiLock S3 Max for $400: This lock is cool because it includes a camera, letting the device double as a digital peephole (convenient for smaller family members!) and has a super interesting biometric option that uses the veins in your palm for authentication. Unfortunately, once installed, the lock didn't work on my door, even though it was the correct size and placement.

Schlage Encode Lever for $239: This lock was easy enough to install but wouldn't sync with my phone or with my Wi-Fi. It did retain the codes I was able to quickly type in during my incomplete setup, but after that point, the app didn't acknowledge I had set up the lock, nor would it re-sync even after restarting.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Bad News for China: Rare Earth Elements Aren't That Rare","https://www.wired.com/story/rare-earth-minerals-china-tariffs/","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

As the trade war between China and the United States continues to escalate, Beijing is responding by turning to one of its favorite retaliation tactics: limiting the export of critical minerals used in many high-tech electronics, from fighter jets to wind turbines. While China's mineral restrictions may sound scary, the reality is that they haven't been very effective in the past and stand to become even less so if the US and other countries finally get their acts together.

It all started in July 2023, when the Chinese government announced it would restrict the export of gallium and germanium, two critical minerals that are mostly used in making solar panels and semiconductors. Over the following two years, China's list of controlled products expanded to include antimony, graphite, and other materials. Earlier this month, the Chinese government escalated things even further, subjecting seven rare earth elements to a more comprehensive export licensing program that covers the whole world and is designed to further choke off American companies.

Rare earths are a subset of elements under the broader umbrella of critical minerals that China has long enjoyed monopoly control over. In the short term, companies that need these rare earths might be able to rely on existing stockpiles or even turn to recycled electronics to find them. But eventually, the US and other countries will be forced to either ramp up domestic mining or reduce their dependence on rare earths, both of which would make China's policies sting less. “China has got one shot, and it knows it,” says Ian Lange, an associate professor of economics and business at the Colorado School of Mines.

The export controls China announced earlier this month cover samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium—seven elements that belong to what is known as the rare earth family. They are called “rare” not because of their scarcity but because they often are mixed with other mineral resources and can be hard to separate out.

There are 17 rare earth elements in total, but the Chinese government chose these seven because they are part of a smaller subset of “heavy” rare earth minerals that the country has more control over than others, says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. That monopoly was built over decades as China created a robust supply chain for these minerals and the rest of the world turned away from what is a heavily polluting and niche sector. “China processes pretty much 100 percent of the world's heavy rare earths, which means that they don't just have a comparative advantage, they have an absolute advantage,” says Baskaran.

But the other important thing to know about rare earths is that—while they are used in a wide variety of products—those items typically only contain very small quantities, and often only in supportive roles. Last year, the United States imported about $170 million worth of rare earth elements, including some that China hasn't restricted yet, according to the United States Geological Survey. For comparison, the US imported over $327 million worth of fresh potatoes and $300 million worth of potato chips between September 2023 and August 2024.

Perhaps the most important application for rare earth elements is creating magnets that improve the performance of products like electric motors in high temperatures. These magnets can be found in electric vehicles and consumer products like vacuum cleaners.

“The heavy rare earth elements are added as sort of a spice, a doping agent, to maintain the magnetism of the magnet at high temperatures. It also improves corrosion resistance and the longevity of the magnet,” says Seaver Wang, director of the climate and energy team at the Breakthrough Institute, an Oakland-based think tank.

Beyond magnets, these rare earth elements can also serve a range of purposes, such as making metal stronger, improving radar systems, and even treating cancer. Without them, in many cases, technological infrastructure and consumer gadgets won't be able to perform at the same level—but they will still maintain their basic functions. “The wind turbines will just go out of service 10 years earlier; electric vehicles will not last as long,” says Wang.

Lange agrees that the impact of losing access to heavy rare earth elements would be somewhat manageable for American companies. “One place where that rare earth is in your car is in the motors that pull up and down your window,” says Lange. “There are ways to just deal with some things that are not as fun, like rolling down your windows by hand.”

In the past, China's critical mineral restrictions haven't worked very well. One reason is that US companies that want to buy rare earth minerals can simply go through an intermediary country first. For example, Belgium has emerged as a possible re-export hub that appears to pass germanium—one of the minerals Beijing first restricted in 2023—from China to the US, according to trade data. Since the European Union has much closer ties with Washington than with Beijing, it's difficult for the Chinese government to effectively stop this flow of trade.

Another sign that China's export controls haven't been very effective is that the price of critical minerals has increased only slightly since the policies were first implemented, indicating that supply levels have remained steady. “Whatever they did in 2023 hasn't really changed the status quo” of the market, says Lange.

But China's latest restrictions are more expansive, and there's already some evidence that things could be different this time. Companies that need these elements have been forced to buy them from other firms with existing private stockpiles, which have become more valuable in recent weeks. “There is a very steep increase in prices to draw down on stockpiles right now,” says Baskaran, citing conversations she's had with rare earth traders.

In the long run, however, companies may be able to find technological solutions to address a potential shortage of rare earth minerals. Tesla, for example, announced in 2023 that it had reduced the use of them in its EV motors by 25 percent, and it planned to get rid of them completely in the future. The carmaker hasn't clarified what it would use instead, but experts speculate it could be turning to other types of magnets that don't rely on rare earths.

While rare earths, or critical minerals in general, are often cited along with semiconductors as industries the US wants to reshore the most, the challenges associated with bringing each of them back are very different.

Unlike making advanced semiconductors, which requires using sophisticated machinery worth hundreds of millions of dollars and building extremely complicated factories, critical minerals aren't that hard to produce. The technologies involved to mine and refine them are mature and both the US and Canada have large natural deposits of some of them. But the mining industry was pushed out of the West because it doesn't generate much value and is also extremely polluting.

In the past, efforts to build up the critical minerals supply chain in the US have either been slowed down or called off. That's more due to basic economic calculations, says Lange, rather than technological difficulties. “It's like bending down to pick up a nickel,” he says, meaning the effort isn't worth the reward.

Because companies only need tiny quantities of these minerals, the market for them is very volatile—prices can drop when a single new factory comes online and starts mass producing and refining them. That means if a mining company were to open up shop in the US, it could inadvertently tank the price of the same mineral it's trying to profit from, says Lange.

But if China succeeds in strictly enforcing its export control policies, it might provide just enough incentive for the US government and private companies to finally reshore the mineral refining industry. If that happens, Lange says, it could take about two years for a new critical mineral operation to open in the US.

“It's really remarkable how China has actually maintained these monopolies in so many critical minerals for 20 years,” says Wang. “But I do think we are maybe starting to turn the corner, where China's market share may be peaking … and you are starting to see a resurgence of interest in these industries in Northern Europe, Australia, Canada, the US, and Latin America.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Finland Could Be the First Country in the World to Bury Nuclear Waste Permanently","https://www.wired.com/story/finland-is-developing-a-permanent-way-to-deal-with-spent-nuclear-fuel/","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 09:30:00 GMT","

Since the arrival of nuclear power in the 1950s, more than 400 reactors in 31 countries have produced about 430,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel, and until now no one has developed a permanent solution for disposing of it. The International Atomic Energy Agency estimates that about 30 percent of this fuel has been reprocessed—elements in spent fuel can be recycled to create new fuel for nuclear plants—but the rest has been “parked” in temporary storage systems, with its final destination yet to be determined.

And with the nuclear sector showing signs of undergoing a renaissance—as countries look to decarbonize energy production and with the tech sector seeking ways to power its electricity-hungry AI systems—the pressure for nuclear-waste disposal is likely to grow.

The best solution would be to put spent fuel in an underground facility that can contain it safely for millennia. Spent fuel is a major threat to human health for at least 10,000 years and remains radioactive for several million. But such facilities have to be built from scratch, and while several are being developed, none have been completed. The leader in this race is Finland, which has dug the underground space needed for a repository.

On the country's west coast, roughly three hours' drive from the capital, Helsinki, is what will become the country's first encapsulation plant. Known as Onkalo, it will receive spent fuel from Finland's five nuclear reactors—three on the nearby island of Olkiluoto and two in Loviisa, in the southeast of the country. The repository is being built by Posiva Oy, a Finnish company set up by two of the country's nuclear operators in 1995 to find a way of permanently storing spent nuclear fuel.

In the bedrock here, at a depth of 430 meters, testing is underway. Storage of spent fuel involves placing spent fuel rods inside copper canisters, which in turn have to be inserted into slots dug into the granite walls of the subterranean repository. Everything is then sealed with bentonite, a soft, plastic clay that insulates the containers and acts as a buffer against minor movements in the bedrock.

In mid-March, five test containers, filled with nonradioactive materials, were sealed in a special aboveground facility before being transported underground and stored along a 70-meter-long subterranean tunnel, to provide an initial proof of concept for Onkalo's storage process. The completion of this dummy run puts Finland in the lead in the race to build the world's first operational deep geological repository.

Onkalo's construction has so far cost €900 million, while an estimated €4 billion more is needed to complete the project. Breaking ground here followed decades of research to find the best location for the repository and years waiting for permits and approvals. There are some who still don't believe the project will happen and others who hope it won't. Some locals have been hostile to the project, unhappy with the prospect of nuclear waste being stored nearby and perplexed at how easily, in their opinion, Posiva Oy was able to get permits for the repository. Researchers have also expressed concerns about potential corrosion of storage containers, specifically the copper canisters.

Together with his colleagues, Jinshan Pan, a professor of corrosion science at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, published a study in January 2023 devoted to the risk of sulfides in groundwater corroding the copper used for spent nuclear fuel containers. “More work is needed to define […] the nature and chemistry of the surface films that develop on copper surfaces in repository conditions,” the paper says.

While Posiva Oy looks like it may have the first functioning repository, other countries are following its lead. Neighbouring Sweden is also preparing to start work on its own repository, which is intended to contain up to 12,000 metric tons of Swedish spent nuclear fuel. It is expected to extend over 60 kilometers of tunnel once it is finished, at a depth of 500 meters. It is a major work that has been on the drawing table for 40 years and obtained its necessary environmental permits for construction only a few months ago. Construction could start within the next decade and would continue until the 2080s, with this repository's underground space gradually extending—provided an appeal made by the Office for Nuclear Waste Review, a Swedish NGO, does not slow or halt the work. Concerns about the Swedish project are the same as with the Finnish one: danger of corrosion of the copper canisters, possibly resulting in the release of radioactive elements into the groundwater.

On the other side of the Atlantic, Canada is also planning to build a storage facility. The repository doesn't exist yet, but the path forward appears relatively free of obstacles—at least there are no apparent legal ones. After 14 years of dialog and debates, the relevant bodies and citizens have selected a host site within the Township of Ignace, Ontario, part of the indigenous community the Wabigoon Lake Ojibway Nation. Both the town and nation were open to the project, seeing it as a source of investments and new jobs.

France and Switzerland are also working on projects, gradually making progress, even if much of it is a matter of getting over bureaucratic hurdles. In the Meuse region of northeastern France, field work on the Cigéo project could begin in 2027 now that it has received a positive assessment of its soundness. The implementing company Andra has been authorized to continue with plans, providing it gives greater consideration to the potential impact of climate change on the aboveground structures.

It has taken Switzerland's national radioactive-waste-disposal cooperative, Nagra, 14 years to decide where to locate its storage facility. It has chosen to build its repository north of Zurich, in Nördlich Lägern, because it is an area particularly rich in very compact opaline clay, which is perfect for acting as a long-term container for radioactive materials. (Finland's site is also rich in this material.) Final approval is expected around 2030, subject to a referendum, and the repository should start to operate by 2060.

Finally, Italy is considering 51 sites that could potentially be suitable to host a repository for nuclear waste storage. These plans were first drawn up in 2015 and then published in December 2023. The government has since decided to reopen the application process to accommodate new applications. In the meantime, radioactive waste in the country remains stored in temporary repositories at the sites of decommissioned nuclear power plants, nuclear research facilities, and nuclear medicine and industry locations.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Tech That Safeguards the Conclave's Secrecy","https://www.wired.com/story/technology-used-to-shield-conclave-pope-francis/","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 06:00:00 GMT","

In 2005, cell phones were banned for the first time during the conclave, the process by which the Catholic Church elects its new pope. Twenty years later, after the death of Pope Francis, the election process is underway again. Authorities have two priorities: to protect the integrity of those attending the meeting, and to ensure that it proceeds in strict secrecy (under penalty of excommunication and imprisonment) until the final decision is made.

By 2025, the Gendarmerie corps guarding Vatican City faces unprecedented technological challenges compared to other conclaves. Among them are artificial intelligence systems, drones, military satellites, microscopic microphones, a misinformation epidemic, and a world permanently connected and informed through social media.

The conclave is scheduled to take place approximately 20 days after the pope's death. The Vatican and the Holy See are preparing for the arrival of the cardinals who will vote for the next leader of the Catholic faith. Emergency and control bodies are also working on it with state-of-the-art technology. So far, they have not shared details about their security arrangements, but they are not inexperienced in the task of safeguarding the integrity of high-profile figures in the face of today's technological risks.

In fact, the election in 2013 of Jorge Mario Bergoglio—the real name of Pope Francis—as supreme pontiff gives some indications of the rigorous security strategies that will be presented in the next conclave.

The Vatican has internet access, but within the areas where the cardinals will reside and vote for the new pope, there will be signal jammers. The technology prevents two devices from communicating with each other through radio frequency interference. The headquarters becomes an electronic bunker. Thus, if someone were to manage to introduce a microphone, telephone, or computer, they would be unable to transmit information.

However, the possibility of administrative staff or the cardinals themselves introducing technology is remote. Authorities inspect the building for days in search of unauthorized microphones or cameras, check every permitted attendee, and double-check participants.

Contemporary satellites are capable of taking pictures of people's faces from space, while AI can interpret lip movements. However, since there's currently no technology to see through walls with such high resolution, the best strategy against espionage in the conclave is to close doors and windows.

During meetings and in the sleeping quarters, voters are not allowed to look outside. In addition, before the cardinals arrive, Vatican staff place opaque film over windows so that no journalist, satellite, or drone can take pictures of the interior.

The Vatican covers only 0.44 square kilometer in area. It is the smallest nation in the world. Until 2018, it had 650 cameras monitoring its streets from an underground command center. In addition, the Vatican City Gendarmerie, which functions as a conventional police force, and the Pontifical Swiss Guard, which acts as an army, are located within the territory. While in photographs they appear to be wearing antique costumes and carrying halberds, the latter group has highly trained personnel with heavy weapons, such as machine guns, rifles, and explosives.

An estimated 200,000 people are expected to be present in the small city-state once the conclave has determined the name of Pope Francis' successor.

In the arid region south of Mexicali, where the pale desert dominates the landscape, the Las Arenitas wetland feels like a mirage. But it is real, and is an oasis for endemic and migratory birds that cross the Colorado River delta. Here, just south of the US-Mexico border, used water from the city of Mexicali gets a second life. Half of it goes to the nearby Hardy River, in an attempt to revive ecosystems that were thought to be irrecoverable.

Historically, waterways here have been flushed full of sewage—particularly the New River, which runs off from the Colorado River northwards, crossing from Mexico into the United States and ending in the Salton Sea in California. For many years, this water course received untreated sewage from Mexicali, rendering it one of the worst-polluted rivers of its size in the US. In the 1990s, American and Mexican authorities could no longer ignore how bad the problem had become, and they began collaborating on infrastructure to lessen the pollution. And so, in 2007, south of Mexicali, the Las Arenitas treatment plant began operations.

Mexicali, which sits right on the border, generates more than 80 million cubic meters of sewage a year. Of that total, 90 percent is collected, with 46 percent of that going to Las Arenitas.

Mexicali is one of the hottest cities in the world. In summer, the region reaches 50°C.

In the sewage plant, solids and sediments are first removed from the wastewater. Next, surface-aerated lagoons are used, where air is injected into the water to stimulate the growth of aerobic bacteria, which decompose organic matter in the presence of oxygen. The water then passes to facultative lagoons, where aerobic and anaerobic bacteria complement each other, the latter degrading organic matter that the former could not. Finally, the water reaches the maturation lagoons, where the remaining solids settle out.

When it launched, this new system worked. “In the beginning, the plant did not perform ideally,” says Edith Santiago, deputy director of the Colorado River delta program in Mexicali at the conservation nonprofit the Sonoran Institute. To combat this, some organizations proposed to the water management agency that they should use the surrounding land, which decades ago housed a lake, to create an artificial wetland that would give the water additional cleanliness.

Such a plan, as well as helping with the city's sewage problem, would also help partially restore the local landscape to its former state. Before the overexploitation of the Colorado River, its delta crossed Baja California and Sonora until it met the waters of the Gulf of California, resulting in more than 400,000 hectares of wetlands. Although the river's course has become a ghost, about 15 percent of those wetlands have survived, harboring an invaluable biodiversity of plants and animals. Seeking to mimic that strength, the Las Arenitas artificial wetland is a pause to the devastation of the local landscape.

Edith Santiago, deputy director of the Colorado River delta program in Mexicali at the Sonoran Institute.

Construction of the wetlands began in 2009, a collaboration between the federal and state governments, water agencies, and investments obtained by the conservation nonprofit Pronatura Noroeste and the Sonoran Institute. In addition, they replaced obsolete equipment and made repairs to the plant.

“Wetlands are the kidneys of the planet—they help to filter and clean the water, to remove particles through the different plants,” explains Santiago. This process, where plants naturally cleanse water, is known as phytoremediation, and it occurs both underground in the roots of tule and alkaline reed, but also on the surface of the wetland waters, where microorganisms that degrade pollutants live.

Microscopic life within the wetlands cleanses the water in diverse ways, such as by transforming nitrogen into other substances and by assimilating phosphorus into its own biomass. In addition, physical processes such as sedimentation occur, in which smaller particles fall to the bottom of the water body.

The Revive the Colorado River Alliance reports that 50 percent of the water leaving the wetland flows into the Hardy River.

The wetlands' battle to maintain their balance is titanic, as the water treatment plant has been operating above capacity since 2013. The plant has an installed capacity of 840 liters per second, but it reaches 1,044 liters per second in some months. An expansion of the plant, while urgent, is yet to happen—though it has been on the table for more than five years.

It's possible to smell when the wetland ecosystem is out of kilter: The decomposition of organic matter there can generate unpleasant odors when these systems are under stress or out of balance, giving the environment an earthy, pungent aroma.

Assessing the quality of the treatment system's discharges is costly, and Santiago points out that there are two key things that could improve the processing of the water here further still: “Implementing better water use in the city, and new technology such as activated sludge in the plant, which uses less space than the lagoons and is faster.”

The Las Arenitas complex has transformed 99 hectares into a wetland.

When the wetland was designed, it was agreed that 30 percent of its annual water volume would flow along the Hardy River to the south for environmental use—that is, to sustain the life of this river, but also for the benefit of local communities, among them, the Cucapa indigenous group. The amount flowing into the Hardy River has now risen to 50 percent. “That the water from Las Arenitas flows along the Hardy River generates environmental potential; many species of birds and other wildlife use this area or live in it,” says Santiago.

Plants in wetlands help the process through phytoremediation.

Re-creating wetlands in the region also has a unique ecological benefit. In 2009, the first bird census in the area yielded about eight species and fewer than 100 birds in total. Six years later, researchers counted 160 different species, with a peak count of 18,000 birds. They have recorded Yuma clapper rails, brown pelicans, peregrine falcons, and northern shovelers.

An assessment of ecosystem services provided by the wetlands in the arid zone of Mexicali, published in 2023, highlighted the system's high potential for regulating water flows, promoting environmental education, and recharging the local aquifer.

That last point is an important one. The city of Mexicali depends on the Colorado River and its underground water reserves, but it uses water at an unsustainable rate. Annual recharge of the Mexicali Valley aquifer is 520.5 cubic hectometers (hm3), but more water is withdrawn from this underground store each year than reenters it (783.12 hm3). Meanwhile, the Colorado River is being squeezed to exhaustion, and is approaching a collapse that climate change is accelerating. Without Las Arenitas, the situation would be even worse, but drastically more needs to be done to balance the region's water use.

“My dream for Las Arenitas is that the community will come to enjoy it, but, at the same time, that there will be better water use in our homes so that less water reaches this area in poor conditions,” Santiago says.

Amazon's Project Kuiper, the company's initiative to launch a fleet of satellites into low-Earth orbit and beam internet connection to users, is struggling to ramp up production, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.

The competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink has completed only a few dozen satellites, according to the report. The venture reportedly needs to quadruple its rate of production in order to meet a government deadline, which requires the company to launch 1,600 satellites into space by next summer.

Project Kuiper seems to be a long way off from catching up with Starlink, which currently has roughly 8,000 satellites in orbit and more than 5 million customers, the report notes.

Besides production delays, Kuiper's satellites have struggled to hitch a ride into space due to rocket launch delays, which are common for the space industry. A launch scheduled for earlier this month was called off due to weather and is now rescheduled for next week.

Months after first testing ads in select markets, including the U.S., Meta on Wednesday announced that its Instagram Threads app would now expand ads to all advertisers worldwide. The expansion will allow eligible advertisers to reach Threads' over 320 million monthly active users, and it will include access to an inventory filter to control the sensitivity level of content next to which the ads run.

The company says that the new ad placement within the Threads feed will be switched on by default for all new ad campaigns that use either Meta's Advantage+ or Manual Placements. However, advertisers on the latter plan will have the option to opt out of the Threads feed. 

Meta notes that the ads themselves will only be delivered in select markets at launch and will roll out to more markets over time. 

To date, Threads has been testing ads in the U.S. and Japan.

The expansion signals that Meta thinks that the Threads community is now robust enough to monetize and compete for advertiser dollars against its top rival, Elon Musk's X. What's more, Meta thinks its platform is more advertiser-friendly, as three out of four Threads users already follow at least one business on the app, it says.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors on the company's most recent earnings call in January that he expects Threads to reach more than 1 billion people over the next “several years.” He also noted that the network had been adding “more than 1 million signups per day.”

However, the Threads app itself didn't entirely grow organically. Instead, it benefited from the network effects of being connected to Instagram, building on Instagram's existing friend graph when onboarding new users. That made Threads nearly instantly function as an extension of users' Instagram networks, where they could follow a similar set of friends, creators, and brands as before.

That competitive edge, built on the base of owning and operating some of the world's biggest social networks, is something Meta is now defending in its antitrust trial with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. The trial could ultimately result in Meta being forced to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp, if the government's prosecution is successful.

To help grow Threads, Meta has borrowed concepts from emerging social networks like Mastodon and Bluesky.

Like Mastodon, Meta is integrating its app with the ActivityPub protocol, which connects Threads to a wider, decentralized open web known as the fediverse. Though that integration has yet to complete, Threads could one day easily become the largest service operating in the fediverse as a result, dwarfing Mastodon's 8+ million registered users and its under 1 million monthly actives.

In total, the fediverse today (not including Threads) has north of 16 million users.

Threads has also copied some of Bluesky's more popular features, including the ability to create custom feeds outside of the default algorithmic feed, and introduced its own take on Bluesky's Starter Packs, offering curated lists of recommended users for newcomers to follow. 

Unlike Bluesky, which now has over 35 million users, Threads users are still defaulted to Threads' “For You” feed when they launch the app. They also don't have the option to control their own moderation preferences, as Bluesky users do.

Linktree is launching a set of new features aimed at helping creators earn more money directly from its platform. The new tools include the ability to sell courses, earn from brand-sponsored links, and build shoppable storefronts.

The launch of the new monetization features will help Linktree stand out among other similar platforms like Beacons and Shorby, as they expand on Linktree's simple link-in-bio service. 

The new features also enable Linktree to compete with creator monetization platforms like Patreon.

To allow users to build and sell courses directly on Linktree, the company is partnering with Kajabi. The new capability will enable creators to monetize their expertise. For example, a fitness trainer can share their workout programs, or a musician can teach their craft through courses. Creators can set the price for their courses and start earning through a Stripe integration.

Linktree is also making it easier for creators to sell digital products like e-books, templates, guides, and more. While Linktree has already allowed creators to do so, it was possible through a partnership with SendOwl. Now, creators can sell digital products directly through Linktree without a third-party involved. This means that Linktree can now charge a take rate on digital goods sold through the platform. These rates are based on the Linktree plan you're on.

The launch of this feature comes a year after Patreon introduced the ability for creators to sell one-off digital goods. As with courses, you can set the price for your digital products on Linktree.

“Creators or many people around the world have something to share, have something to teach,” Linktree CEO Alex Zaccaria told TechCrunch. “We want to make that far more accessible.”

In addition, everyone in the U.S. on Linktree can now build a shop to earn commission on products. Shops let you earn commission from brands like Target, Amazon, Lululemon, and Revolve. Or, creators can choose to add affiliate links directly to their Linktree account.

As for the new sponsored links capability, brands can now pay creators directly for space on their Linktree. For instance, a creator can get paid when a follower subscribes to Hulu through their Linktree. These links will be clearly labeled as “sponsored.”

“Creators will see these sponsored links they can put on their Linktree,” Zaccaria said. “Right now they're getting paid per attribution or per conversion, but we will roll that into cost per click and cost per impression as well so it's not just affiliate type stuff, there's a native ads on Linktree.”

Linktree is also launching “Rewards,” which is a new incentive program that offers creators perks like bonus commissions when they reach certain milestones. The program could lead to direct brand collabs, the company notes.

Every creator on Linktree will get access to a new “wallet” that will house all of the earning that they make from these features, Zaccaria said. 

“Everything's dropped into one single wallet,” he said. “No matter what you're doing across all your courses, you're selling your digital products, you're selling and the things, you're curating from sponsored links, to the Linktree Shop. The wallet is a new feature that's been in beta for a little while. It's mostly for Linktree shops, but now there's four extra ways to monetize and it's all also going into the wallet.”

Linktree says the features announced on Wednesday will help its user base of over 70 million users make sustainable incomes. Creators can access all of the new monetization features by going to the new “Earn” section of their Linktree, either in the app or on the web.

Cloud monitoring and security platform Datadog on Wednesday said it has acquired Metaplane, an AI-powered data observability startup.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

In a press release, Datadog said that the deal “accelerates” its expansion into data observability, building on the launch of related products. Metaplane will continue supporting its existing and new customers through a rebranded “Metaplane by Datadog” offering.

“Observability is no longer just for developers and IT teams; it's now an essential part of data teams' day-to-day responsibilities as they manage increasingly complex and business-critical workflows,” Datadog VP Michael Whetten said in a statement. “This complexity will become even more pronounced as more businesses deploy AI applications. By unifying observability across applications and data, Datadog will help organizations build reliable AI systems.”

MIT graduate Kevin Hu, former HubSpot engineer Peter Casinelli, and ex-Appcues developer Guru Mahendran founded Metaplane in 2020. They originally launched the company as a “customer success” product that analyzed firms' data to prevent churn, but after going through Y Combinator — and with the pandemic hitting — Metaplane pivoted but continued to build data analytics-focused tools.

Metaplane monitors data using anomaly detection AI models trained primarily on historical metadata. It attempts to establish lineages in a data warehouse — the systems used for reporting and data analysis — and notifies stakeholders of issues via their tool of choice (e.g. Slack, PagerDuty, and so on). From those tools, users can mark any alert as an expected change or otherwise, and Metaplane's system will learn over time.

Metaplane had until now raised $22.2 million in total from investors including Khosla Ventures, Y Combinator, Flybridge Capital Partners, Vercel CEO Guillermo Rauch, and HubSpot CTO Dharmesh Shah. As of January 2023, the Boston-based startup had around 10 employees.

“Our mission at Metaplane is to help companies ensure trust in the data that powers their business,” Hu said in a statement. “Joining forces with Datadog enables us to bring data observability to tens of thousands more companies, while bringing data teams and software teams closer together.”

Metaplane is Datadog's second acquisition this year. In January, the company acquired Quickwit, an open source, cloud-native search engine for logs.  

It makes sense for Datadog to broaden its footprint in data observability, as this is a large and healthy market — one that could become a significant source of business for Datadog down the line. The company recently reported better-than-expected net profit, but its full-year 2025 revenue forecast fell below what analysts had expected.

According to Grand View Research, the market for data observability tools was worth $2.14 billion in 2023 and could grow at a 12.2% compound annual growth rate between 2024 and 2030. Of course, there's stiff competition. Big players include Monte Carlo, Cribl, Manta, Observe, Better Stack, Coralogix, and Unravel Data.

Datadog's challenge will be sufficiently differentiating its data observability products, which it is attempting to do both through acquisitions as well as in-house projects such as data jobs and data streams monitoring.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","Seeing AI as a collaborator, not a creator","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/23/1114891/editors-letter-creativity-art-ai-collaboration-humanity-technology/","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

The key to artistic achievement isn't about technology but the way artists apply it to express our humanity.

The reason you are reading this letter from me today is that I was bored 30 years ago. 

I was bored and curious about the world and so I wound up spending a lot of time in the university computer lab, screwing around on Usenet and the early World Wide Web, looking for interesting things to read. Soon enough I wasn't content to just read stuff on the internet—I wanted to make it. So I learned HTML and made a basic web page, and then a better web page, and then a whole website full of web things. And then I just kept going from there. That amateurish collection of web pages led to a journalism internship with the online arm of a magazine that paid little attention to what we geeks were doing on the web. And that led to my first real journalism job, and then another, and, well, eventually this journalism job. 

But none of that would have been possible if I hadn't been bored and curious. And more to the point: curious about tech. 

The university computer lab may seem at first like an unlikely center for creativity. We tend to think of creativity as happening more in the artist's studio or writers' workshop. But throughout history, very often our greatest creative leaps—and I would argue that the web and its descendants represent one such leap—have been due to advances in technology. 

There are the big easy examples, like photography or the printing press, but it's also true of all sorts of creative inventions that we often take for granted. Oil paints. Theaters. Musical scores. Electric synthesizers! Almost anywhere you look in the arts, perhaps outside of pure vocalization, technology has played a role.  

But the key to artistic achievement has never been the technology itself. It has been the way artists have applied it to express our humanity. Think of the way we talk about the arts. We often compliment it with words that refer to our humanity, like soul, heart, and life; we often criticize it with descriptors such as sterile, clinical, or lifeless. (And sure, you can love a sterile piece of art, but typically that's because the artist has leaned into sterility to make a point about humanity!)

All of which is to say I think that AI can be, will be, and already is a tool for creative expression, but that true art will always be something steered by human creativity, not machines. 

I could be wrong. I hope not. 

This issue, which was entirely produced by human beings using computers, explores creativity and the tension between the artist and technology. You can see it on our cover illustrated by Tom Humberstone, and read about it in stories from James O'Donnell, Will Douglas Heaven, Rebecca Ackermann, Michelle Kim, Bryan Gardiner, and Allison Arieff. 

Yet of course, creativity is about more than just the arts. All of human advancement stems from creativity, because creativity is how we solve problems. So it was important to us to bring you accounts of that as well. You'll find those in stories from Carrie Klein, Carly Kay, Matthew Ponsford, and Robin George Andrews. (If you've ever wanted to know how we might nuke an asteroid, this is the issue for you!)  

We're also trying to get a little more creative ourselves. Over the next few issues, you'll notice some changes coming to this magazine with the addition of some new regular items (see Caiwei Chen's “3 Things” for one such example). Among those changes, we are planning to solicit and publish more regular reader feedback and answer questions you may have about technology. We invite you to get creative and email us: newsroom@technologyreview.com.

As always, thanks for reading.

The Nintendo Switch 2 is now available to pre-order starting tonight with the official release date as June 5, 2025. Walmart is beginning pre-orders of the Switch 2 precisely at midnight Eastern Time on April 24, 2025 (which is 9:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the 23rd).

Nintendo fans have two choices to choose from now: the Switch 2 console for $449.99 on its own, or the Mario Kart World bundle that includes the console and the eagerly awaited new Mario Kart game for $499.99. This is a great deal since Mario Kart World by itself can be bought for $79.99, so this is a great purchase for fans wanting to dive right into the new racing adventure from the start. Make sure you pre-order your Switch 2 asap as it can run out of stock pretty quickly.

See Switch 2 at Walmart

See Switch 2 + Mario Kart at Walmart

One of the most popular retailers to put your Nintendo Switch 2 preorder is Walmart: Walmart surpasses many other retailers by ensuring delivery by 9 a.m. local time on release date, June 5, for customers who preorder by June 4 at 8 a.m. ET (while supplies last). The guarantee of on-time delivery is a major advantage, especially with the expected high demand and short supply. Remember, Nintendo just postponed the pre-order phase in the U.S. by a few weeks, and the stock is still pretty short.

So, why should you buy the latest Nintendo console? The Switch 2 hype is well-deserved given its stunning upgrade over the original Switch and the most impressive feature is a larger 7.9-inch LCD touchscreen with a 1080p full resolution in handheld mode (which is a gigantic improvement over the 6.2-inch 720p screen of the original). For those who like to play on the TV, the Switch 2 can output at 4K resolution for some games and offers beautifully rendered pictures the older system could not deliver. The refresh rate has also been doubled to 120Hz in handheld mode to allow for smoother gameplay especially for fast-paced genres like fighting and shooters. HDR support brings even more color vibrancy and lighting effects to the gaming experience.

Other than simply the screen, the Switch 2 available for pre-order has a new and wider kickstand that spans almost the whole back of the console and offers multiple adjustable angles. The new Joy-Con controllers snap on and off magnetically and connect via pins which makes the setup easier and their durability better. Sound also got a boost with built-in speakers that support 3D audio while a new Chat button offers voice chat using a built-in noise-cancelling microphone. Storage has been also increased massively to 256GB from the original Switch's 32GB and the console supports faster microSD Express cards.

The gaming community is eager for the hardware but also for the launch games of the Switch 2. Mario Kart World promises expansive race courses with changing weather and improved water effects and other nostalgic franchises like Donkey Kong and Kirby are back with optimized-for-the-new-console games as well. Worth pointing out is the fact that Switch 2 remains compatible with the majority of today's Switch titles.

If you're looking to pre-order the Switch 2, you must act quickly. Nintendo is trying to close down scalping and outrageous resale price markups but demand will greatly exceed supply. There will be stock shortages and with tariffs and import fees unpredictable, prices could skyrocket. Putting in a preorder today on the Nintendo console, especially with a good retailer like Walmart that guarantees on-launch delivery, is the best way to ensure that you'll be able to get your hands on the new console asap.

Noise-cancellation is a great addition on any premium pair of headphones or earbuds, but what it does is drive up the price way high. It's not something that's always needed. If you're not frequently riding on airplanes or trying to drown out the sounds of a couple arguing in the apartment next door, you'll probably be find just listening on the standard mode. So, you'd only be paying the standard price, not premium. Well, Soundcore has a solid pair of wireless earbuds that get the job done and are crazy affordable. Normally they go for $40 which is already pretty reasonable. But for a limited time, you can secure yourself a pair for 50% off. That's right. At the time of writing this, the Soundcore by Anker P20i true wireless earbuds are just $20.

See at Amazon

Available in a variety of fun colors including black, white, blue, light blue, and pink, these wireless earbuds feature 10mm drivers with big bass sound. You can still get lost in your music without the fancy noise cancelation of expensive headphones.

These Soundcore earbuds let you customize their sound to your preferences. Within the Soundcore app, you can choose between 22 EQ preset modes. The app also has its own “Find My Earbuds” feature the way Apple does for all its products.  They'll even emit a sound on demand to help you locate them. That comes in handy when you don't remember what bag you place them in and don't know if you left that at home or in the office.

You can listen to your favorite music and podcasts through the entire work day as these Soundcore earbuds can get up to 10 hours of battery life on a single charge. That time is extended further with the charging case which can boost that up to 30 hours. Find yourself in a pinch where neither the buds nor case are charger? No worries. A quick 10-minute charge will bring you back up to two full hours of listening time. The charging case also comes with a nifty lanyard attached to make it easy to clip onto your keys or a bag.

These earbuds can be used to take phone calls thanks to their two built-in mics. They use an algorithm to identify your voice over background noises to ensure folks on the other end never have to hear your shout. You'll come through crystal clear.

For a limited time, you can pick up a pair of Soundcore by Anker P20i true wireless earbuds for their all-time low price of just $20.

Crystal Lake gets its own office at A24. Xenomorphs celebrate Earth Day. And can you guess which of the celebrities below will voice Napoleon and Snowball in Andy Serkis' Animal Farm? Alpha, recruit a team of teenagers with attitude: it's Morning Spoilers!

Variety reports Seth Rogen, Gaten Matarazzo, Steve Buscemi, Glenn Close, Laverne Cox, Kieran Culkin, Woody Harrelson, Jim Parsons, Kathleen Turner, and Iman Vellani have joined the voice cast of Andy Serkis' animated adaptation of George Orwell's Animal Farm.

Newly leaked footage from the set of Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow provides a distant glimpse of Jason Momoa in full costume as Lobo.

Elsewhere, a behind-the-scenes featurette on Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning reveals the crew flew out to Svalbard to film a scene of Hayley Atwell riding a dog sled.

Another new featurette sees composer Alexandre Desplat record the score for Jurassic World Rebirth.

We also have a new trailer for Junk World, the sequel to 2017's Junk Head.

The Zombies crew faces off against a rival vampire summer camp in the trailer for Dawn of the Vampires, a fourth entry in the Disney Channel franchise airing this July 10.

In conversation with The Playlist, Paul Giamatti said his character on Starfleet Academy enjoys “a little arc” but becomes “more problematic as the show goes on.”

It was great. I had a ball doing that. And I mean, again, during the Star Trek world, it's lovely people, and it was nothing but pleasure, and it was a dream wish fulfillment for me to be able to be in Star Trek. I play a very interesting, complicated guy, bad guy, I suppose. I'm a bad guy. Yeah, I guess I'm a bad guy. But yeah, so I dunno what more I can say about that without giving too much away.

I'm in more than one episode. I have a little arc through this season. I reappear and become more problematic as the show goes on.

Showrunner Brad Caleb Kane confirmed “offices are live” for A24's upcoming Friday the 13th prequel series, Crystal Lake.

Bloody-Disgusting has a poster for the second season of Wednesday ahead of a new teaser said to arrive later today.

During a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, showrunner Dario Scardapane confirmed Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist are  “absolutely in [his] head and everybody's head” while working on Daredevil: Born Again.

Without giving too much away…when you're working in what I would call the Hell's Kitchen corner of the MCU, those iconic characters are always in your mind. The thing is that — and this is kind of hard, I'm trying to thread a needle here — you want to bring in people and relationships and past figures in Matt's life because they help the story, particularly in terms of a story where Fisk has taken over the city. And there is a resistance and a rebellion, so to speak, rising. So there's going to be people, vigilantes, superheroes that are involved in that. There has to be because this is happening to their city. That said, you also want to create a completely organic story for that. So who comes in and why has to be beyond anything earned. So the easiest answer to your question is, yes, those characters that you just listed off are absolutely in my head and everybody's head as we're working. How that manifests itself is both really tricky writing-wise and a pretty closely guarded secret at this point. So I'm being intentionally cagey, but I'm also saying, ‘Hell yeah!' in terms of it's something we're thinking about.

Experts Weigh in on Bombshell Biosignature Report","https://gizmodo.com/did-scientists-detect-life-on-another-planet-experts-weigh-in-on-bombshell-biosignature-report-2000592296","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 11:00:35 GMT","

Last week, researchers using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) announced they had found something intriguing on a distant exoplanet called K2-18 b: a potential whiff of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), a molecule that, on Earth, is produced almost exclusively by microscopic marine life. The exoplanet, located about 120 light-years away, orbits within the habitable zone of a red dwarf star and may be a Hycean world: a steamy, ocean-covered planet with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.

While the detection came with a statistical confidence of 3-sigma (very promising, but not definitive), headlines around the world buzzed with speculation about the first detection of life beyond Earth. But not everyone's convinced. Scientists across disciplines are now weighing in—some are cautiously optimistic about the latest research, while others are deeply skeptical. Could DMS be a sign of life, or is it just weird, abiotic chemistry happening under extreme conditions?

For this latest Giz Asks, we've rounded up expert reactions to the findings, digging into the chemistry, the data's limitations, and what it'll take to move the needle from “maybe” to something more conclusive. Because in astrobiology, the line between interesting and extraordinary is razor thin. The following responses were lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

A planetary chemist at the University of Cambridge who studies the potential habitability of planets, among other things.

I have worked on developing an understanding of the climate and structure (i.e., the size and temperature of the atmosphere, what underlies the atmosphere etc.) of K2-18 b.

I do not believe the report of DMS in the spectrum of K2-18 b moves the astrobiological needle. The series of steps to having confidence we have seen signs of life beyond Earth are roughly:

The K2-18 b detection has not passed 1 or 2 yet—for that the community needs to confirm for themselves there is a signal. This is not my expertise.

3 and 4 are closer to my expertise. Here, K2-18 b presents a particular challenge to life. There is presently no requirement from the data that this planet hosts liquid water oceans and a climate amenable to life. In fact, based on the data there is every reason to believe the climate will be far too hot for liquid water oceans, with the deep atmosphere potentially being underlain by oceans of magma, not liquid water. For this reason, even if 1 and 2 return a DMS detection, our expectation should be that this [molecule] has emerged in a lifeless, hot, sulfur and hydrogen rich atmosphere and ask ourselves what the atmospheric chemistry is that would have enabled this. Believing instead that this is DMS of biological origin would require overturning our every expectation as to the climate of this planet, without any other reason to do this from the data.

In other words, we are a long way from believing K2-18 b can be inhabited, let alone is inhabited.

A geochemist at the Southwest Research Institute and an expert in researching the possibility of extraterrestrial life on ocean worlds.

This is a very interesting new dataset. It appears that there are unexplained features in the spectrum of K2-18 b, which could be attributed to dimethyl sulfide or dimethyl disulfide. However, these results are stretching JWST to its limits (K2-18 b is a fairly small planet), and it's possible that further analysis may find a lack of statistically significant evidence for these features. We need more astronomers on this case as soon as possible! Currently, I'm intrigued but cautious about the potential presence of these molecules on K2-18 b.

Even if DMS or DMDS are present, we must be very careful in treating them as biosignatures. We've only just begun to ask questions about the abiotic background on this kind of planet. Exotic chemistry might surprise us, as planets are more complex (and wonderfully interesting) than we first assume. For life to be detected, multiple supporting pieces of evidence must be found, and this will take time. Let's digest these new results and get to work.

My preprint includes an important finding quoted below:

“Because a revised deep-atmosphere scenario can accommodate depleted CO [carbon monoxide] and NH3 [ammonia] abundances, the apparent absence of these species should no longer be taken as evidence against this type of scenario for TOI-270 d [a planet orbiting another red dwarf, discovered in 2019] and similar planets, such as K2-18 b. Our results imply that the Hycean hypothesis is currently unnecessary to explain any data, although this does not preclude the existence of Hycean worlds.”

An astrophysicist at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the recent study.

An astrophysicist at Leiden University and an expert on extrasolar planets.

The whole thing is completely blown out of proportions. Sorry that I am a bit short in my answers, but I have had to deal with this in the Dutch and Belgium media for the last two days, and I am a little done.

The research team finds bumps in their spectrum. It is not clear whether these are real, and if so, what they could be caused by. There could be dozens of molecules (if real), or even cloud features. What do the authors do? They just look whether DMS could cause this (and add DMDS). They ignore the dozens of other species [i.e. non-biological sources of molecules] that could cause this bump and call it a day. If I had been the referee, I would have stopped this publication right there. There is no reason to invoke astrobiology, let alone call it the biggest breakthrough or whatever.

Most reporters are writing a piece where they say something like “however, not all scientists are as convinced…” I can tell you, it is much worse than that, but most of us are keeping our mouths shut. I understand why, in these difficult times, but in the long run this will hurt astronomy when nobody will take us seriously anymore. You can quote me on that.

A planetary scientist at MIT specializing in extrasolar planet atmospheres.

Because they likely can't ever be confirmed either way, we have to live with what we might call “biosignature planet candidates.” This planet needs more work to get there. You can be sure that others are working on ways DMS can be produced without life.

I appreciate people's enthusiasm. With more evidence, this and other planets might be “blessed” as biosignature candidates, but will remain in the candidate category indefinitely.

“At what time exactly can you preorder the Nintendo Switch 2?” For eager gamers, that's the very big question as June 5, 2025 (release date) gets closer. The general Switch 2 preorder window is officially opening at a very specific time: midnight Eastern Time on April 24, 2025. So at 12:00 a.m. ET, or 9:00 p.m. Pacific Time on April 23, preorders for the Nintendo console will be available to fans all over the United States online.

Walmart is one of the best retailers to preorder the Switch 2 from. Like Target and Best Buy, Walmart's online pre-orders begin precisely at midnight ET on April 24. What sets Walmart apart is its promotion of free (and guaranteed) delivery by 9 a.m. local time on release day, June 5, for orders placed by June 4 at 8 a.m. ET, while supplies hold out. This early delivery promise on launch day is a special advantage that can be a lifesaver if you're eager to start playing as soon as possible.

Two general buying options have been provided by Nintendo for the Switch 2: The standard console is priced at $449.99 and a bundle of the console and the new Mario Kart World game is available for $499.99. Since Mario Kart World alone retails for $79.99, the bundle is a great value if you want to get into the new racing game immediately.

What's the difference between this new 2025 model and the previous version of the console? The portable display has increased to 7.9 inches at full 1080p resolution which is a big jump from the original's 6.2-inch 720p screen. If you like to play on your TV, you will find that the new console offers 4K output for visuals that were not possible on the original Switch. The refresh rate is doubled (to 120Hz) when in handheld mode, and you'll get HDR support.

Beyond the screen, the Switch 2 also features a new kickstand design that is wider and adjustable at various angles for improved comfort. The Joy-Con controllers now magnetically clip on and connect via pins for simpler setup. Audio improvements include integrated speakers with 3D audio and a new Chat button that activates a built-in noise-cancelling microphone. Storage has also been increased to 256GB (from the original 32GB) and it supports faster microSD Express cards.

What's for sure is that securing a Switch 2 preorder requires moving quickly: demand will probably outpace supply. Stock will likely be gone quickly, and tariffs or import fees can cause prices to increase at any time. Preordering the Switch 2 via an established retailer like Walmart that guarantees release-day shipping is the best option to make sure you receive your console for the listed price.

Nvidia Blackwell AI datacenters get cooling upgrade


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Modern cloud data centers not only consume an immense amount of power for computing and cooling, but also a significant amount of water, as most use evaporative liquid cooling.

By contrast, Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 and GB300 NVL72 machines utilize direct-to-chip liquid cooling systems, which are claimed to be 25 times more energy-efficient and 300 times more water-efficient than today's coolers. However, there is a catch, as NVL72 rack-scale systems consume over seven times more power than typical racks.

Typical data center server racks consume around 20kW of power, whereas Nvidia's H100-based racks consume over 40kW of power. However, Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 and GB300 NVL72 rack-scale systems consume 120kW – 140kW of power, outpacing the vast majority of racks already installed.

As a result, air-based cooling methods are no longer sufficient to manage the thermal loads produced by these high-density racks. Therefore, Nvidia had to adopt a new cooling solution for its Blackwell machines, which led to the development of a new solution.

Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 and GB300 NVL72 systems use direct-to-chip liquid cooling. This approach involves circulating coolant directly through cold plates attached to GPUs, CPUs, and other heat-generating components, efficiently transferring heat away from these devices without relying on air as the intermediary.

Unlike evaporative cooling or immersion cooling, NVL72's liquid cooling is a closed-loop system, so coolant does not evaporate or require replacement due to loss from phase change, saving water.

In the NVL72 architecture, the heat absorbed by the liquid coolant is then transferred to the data center's cooling infrastructure through rack-level liquid-to-liquid heat exchangers. These coolant distribution units (CDUs), such as the CoolIT CHx2000, are capable of managing up to 2 mW of cooling capacity, supporting high-density deployments with low thermal resistance and reliable heat rejection.

Additionally, this setup enables the systems to operate with warm water cooling, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for mechanical chillers, which improves both energy efficiency and water conservation.

There are several things to note about Nvidia's closed-loop direct-to-chip liquid cooling solutions. Although closed-loop liquid cooling solutions are widely used by PC enthusiasts, there are several practical, engineering, and economic reasons why these systems are presently not widely adopted at scale.

Data centers require modularity and accessibility for maintenance, upgrades, and component replacement, which is why they use hot-swappable components. However, hermetically sealed systems make the quick replacement of failed servers or GPUs difficult, as breaking the seal would compromise the entire cluster.

Also, routing sealed liquid loops across racks and the entire data center introduces logistical complexity in piping, pump redundancy, and failure isolation. Fortunately, current direct-to-chip liquid cooling solutions use quick-disconnect fittings with dripless seals, which offer serviceability without full hermetic sealing (at the end of the day, detecting and isolating leaks quickly is cheaper than creating a fully hermetic data center-scale solution). However, using data center-scale liquid cooling still requires redesign of the whole data center, which is expensive.

Nonetheless, since Nvidia's Blackwell processors offer unbeatable performance, adopters of B200 GPUs are willing to invest in such redesigns. Additionally, it is worth noting that Nvidia has co-developed reference designs with Schneider Electric for 1152 GPU DGX SuperPOD GB200 clusters, utilizing Motivair liquid-to-liquid CDUs and fluid coolers with adiabatic assist. This enables the quick deployment of such systems with maximized efficiency.

Although Nvidia mandates the use of liquid cooling with its Blackwell B200 GPUs and systems, the company has invested in reference designs of sealed liquid cooling solutions to avoid the use of evaporative liquid cooling solutions, in an effort to preserve water, which seems to be a reasonable tradeoff.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

China wants to ensure that the materials it sells won't come back to bite it.

Tesla's humanoid robot Optimus, which it says is designed for taking over household chores, has recently hit a production snag, which Elon Musk calls a “magnet issue.” In early April, China blocked the export of seven rare earth metals in response to President Trump's application of 54% tariffs on Chinese goods. Aside from being used in global chipmaking supply chains, these materials are also applied in several high-tech industries, including lasers, radar, jet engines, and more.

“We're working through that with China. Hopefully, we'll get a license to use the rare-earth magnets,” Elon Musk said. “China wants some assurances that these are not used for military purposes, which obviously they're not. They're just going into a humanoid robot.”

However, even if this robot is designed as a substitute for a household employee, its inherent humanoid design makes it useful for other tasks, including those that China might deem “military applications”. Aside from that, Musk's other companies, like SpaceX, have active contracts with the U.S. military. Musk is closely allied with the U.S. president and works with him directly through DOGE or the Department of Government Efficiency. This might make Beijing balk at giving any entity related to him any license for these crucial materials.

Some companies are looking for alternatives to Chinese sources for these rare earth metals, especially as China has claimed state ownership of all this material within its borders. However, they'd have difficulty looking for a replacement that can deliver at the exact cost and quality because of how much the East Asian country has invested in mining them. China produced about 70% of all the rare earth elements in the market in 2023, with 94% of the global gallium supply, crucial for power chips, coming from within its borders.

Many exporters have already expected delays because of China's new requirements. However, Tesla is one of the first companies to publicly state the impact of China's export bans on its plans and production. He also said that Trump's tariffs have greatly impacted Tesla's energy business, primarily as it imports its battery cells from the country.

“The impact of tariffs on the energy business will be outsized since we source LFP (lithium iron phosphate) battery cells from China,” Musk said during the earnings call. “We're in the process of commissioning equipment for the local manufacturing of LFP battery cells in the US.”

But Polymaker announces prices will increase starting May 1st.

While the cost of your next 3D printer may be going up in the U.S., the cost of your filament doesn't have to increase. Or that is, it won't if you buy American. Many customers in the U.S. are bemoaning the impact of President Trump's tariff war on their favorite hobby, with new 3D printers possibly going up hundreds of dollars or remaining mysteriously out of stock.

Polymaker, a global supplier of affordable filament, recently announced that it will be forced to increase prices by 10% on May 1st. In a statement issued on its website, Polymaker said it reviewed the amount of stock sitting in U.S. warehouses before making the difficult decision to hike prices to compensate for tariffs.

I had the chance to talk to Polymaker representatives at Rapid + TCT in Detroit earlier this month and ask them if the new Houston, TX plant would help keep costs down. The answer was yes and no. Unfortunately for the average consumer, the Texas facility specializes in wholesale customers and only produces PLA, PETG, ABS, and ASA in limited colors. You also have to buy over $1,000 in materials to place a wholesale order. But if that's you, congratulations, your prices are holding steady.



Many American filament manufacturers are able to keep their supply chain domestic thanks to NatureWorks, a U.S. plastics company that creates raw PLA pellets from Nebraska-grown corn.

American filament companies are taking advantage of the tariff talks to remind customers that they can always buy local. Polar Filament in Troy, MI announced on social media that pricing would remain the same, as its entire supply chain is US-based.

“So far, we've confirmed that the most critical components, including the resin (the raw plastic pellets), colorants, spools, and even the paper used in our boxes, are all sourced domestically. We're also setting up our own injection molding machine so we can make spools right here at our facility,” said Mitch Davis in the statement.

Polar Filament currently sets its price for Basic PLA at $18.99 and $21.99 for premium colors, besting Polymaker's price by several dollars. Free shipping for US customers kicks in after three spools.

I also stopped to chat with New York-based GreenGate manufacturer Rich Silberfeld during Rapid + TCT in Detroit. GreenGate makes premium recycled PETG filament that can easily print at lower PLA temperatures. Silberfeld said his filament not only saves plastic scraps from going into the landfill, but also uses domestic colorants and spools. He was showcasing a special color, Spartan Armor Green, in honor of Michigan State University while stationed in the America Makes section of Rapid + TCT.

GreenGate is running a sale on the American Bundle, a three-pack of Red, White, and Blue PETG, which also includes free shipping and a t-shirt, for just $86.37.

Companies are letting go of their idle GPUs for instant profits.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Some AI data centers in China are reportedly holding large stocks of China-specific 48GB Nvidia RTX 4090D GPUs, dismantling and refurbishing them, and then reselling them on the market as new cards. DigiTimes Asia reports that a few companies are resorting to letting go of excess computing capacity to generate multiple times the profit compared to renting the GPUs out, which will take them about three to five years to recoup their investment.

This move is a sign of how China's AI rush is leading to billions of dollars in idle infrastructure. The report states that an AI data center requires a utilization rate of more than 70% to 75% for it to turn a profit. However, activation rates remain below 20%, meaning a significant amount of capacity is left unused and many GPUs remain idle. To help them stay afloat, a few companies are turning to selling their unused assets to generate some quick cash and pay off the bank loans they used to purchase their hardware.

Selling RTX 4090 cards is quite lucrative, too. Currently, these China-specific RTX 4090D GPUs with 48GB of VRAM are priced between CNY20,000 and CNY40,000, or approximately US$2,735 and US$5,470. We're unsure if these cards were used at all, but they still need to be modified if the data center wants to sell them to consumers. Data centers typically convert fan-cooled GPUs into blower-style cards, such as this blower-style RTX 5090D leaked on Bilibili, for improved efficiency when used in multi-GPU systems. However, these are much noisier and provide less cooling when used as a single unit.

One surprising aspect is that AI data centers are doing this despite the uncertainty surrounding AI chip supply from the U.S. The White House has recently blocked China-compliant Nvidia H20 and AMD MI308 chips for export to China, and there are also some rumors that the 5090D might also be affected by the ban. In fact, it's rumored that Nvidia has mentioned suspending supplying 5090D chips to its board partners, although it did not mention stopping sales entirely.

Despite this, companies are still letting go of excess capacity — likely because they need to cover their financial costs, or they risk going under. Furthermore, as chip technologies advance, companies that use older-generation AI GPUs will no longer be competitive, and they will be forced to sell these cards anyway. Therefore, it probably makes sense for them to release these underutilized assets now and then purchase whatever is available when demand actually arises.

In a cohort study, 49% of children treated with antiseizure medications (ASMs) developed leucopenia. Most episodes (88%) were mild, with no life-threatening episodes or deaths reported.

""Leucopenia is a far more common side-effect of ASM treatment than earlier believed. There is rarely a need for ASM adjustments in order to treat leucopenia,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Hanna Pettersson, MSc, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. It was published online on April 17, 2025, in The Journal of Pediatrics.

This retrospective study was limited by non-standardised testing and variable data availability between patients as blood count monitoring depended on clinical decisions and treatment duration. Most patients had frequent testing, but some patients had sparse data. Additionally, the study sample consisted mainly of European descent patients, potentially limiting the generalisability of the findings to other populations.

This study was supported by unrestricted grants from the Center for Innovative Medicine/Region Stockholm, the Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation, CSL Behring, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, and the Margarethahemmet Association. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended  nivolumab (Opdivo) plus ipilimumab (Yervoy) for some people in England with advanced colorectal cancer.

The treatment is recommended for adults with untreated, unresectable, or metastatic colorectal cancer that shows high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR).

In final draft guidance, NICE reversed its earlier decision not to recommend the combination therapy. The change followed additional clinical data from the manufacturer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and UK approval by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.

MSI-H and dMMR are biomarkers associated with aggressive forms of colorectal cancer and poorer outcomes.

Around 4%-5% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer present with these biomarkers.

The efficacy and safety of the dual immunotherapy were studied in the CheckMate 8HW trial. This phase 3, randomised, open-label, international study enrolled 128 immunotherapy-naive adults at 128 centres in 23 countries.

Participants had unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer and MSI-H or dMMR confirmed through local testing.

They were randomly assigned to receive either nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab alone, or chemotherapy with or without targeted therapies.

NICE said the combination therapy extended both progression-free survival and overall survival compared with chemotherapy. 

Indirect comparisons also suggested it outperformed pembrolizumab in both measures.

Currently, standard care for this cancer subtype is either chemotherapy or pembrolizumab. 

There are around 44,000 new cases of colorectal cancer diagnosed each year in the UK, with around 17,000 deaths. 

NICE estimated that just over 700 people with untreated metastatic colorectal cancer with MSI-H or dMMR would be eligible to receive the newly approved treatment.

Routine NHS use in England is subject to a commercial arrangement with the manufacturer.

MADRID — Virtual reality (VR)–based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may be an alternative treatment option for patients with paranoia based on results of a new randomized, controlled trial.

The Face Your Fears study compared VR-CBT with regular CBT in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder, schizotypal disorder, or other psychoses. Investigators found both approaches were similarly effective, suggesting either one could be offered.

“When determining treatment choice, we should not only factor in quantity or quality of the intervention but also factors such as patient preference, and cost effectiveness — which we will be looking more into in planned papers,” lead investigator Louise Birkedal Glenthøj, PhD, from the University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark, said.

The findings were presented on April 8 at the European Psychiatric Association Congress (EPA) 2025 annual meeting.

The study included 254 participants, mean age approximately 29-31 years, with schizophrenia spectrum disorder (70%-75%), schizotypal disorder (16%-21%) or other psychoses (8.5%-9.5%). Participants had a baseline score of 41 on the Green Paranoid Thoughts Scale (GPTS) for persecution and were on an olanzapine equivalent dose of 11.7-13.2 mg/d.

Patients completed 10 sessions of either VR-CBT or standard CBT, with both interventions using individually tailored case simulation and goal setting. The control group received symptom-specific CBT for psychosis, with in-vivo exposure therapy in session when possible.

In the VR-CBT group, patients were exposed to simulated social situations controlled by the therapist in real-time. The virtual social environments (a bus, café, street, park, and supermarket) were chosen based on their general capacity to elicit paranoid ideations in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

“We have more than 100 avatars to choose from and we can have them expressing a multitude of emotions and gestures, and we can also transform the therapist's voice into different characters for the patient to engage in role plays with these avatars,” she explained.

A core focus in the VR sessions was reducing patients' dependence on safety behaviors. About 20-40 minutes of each session involved virtual exposure to paranoid-inducing situations as the therapist facilitated a CBT dialog aimed at generating alternative thinking and coping strategies.

In the traditional CBT group, the core focus was on patients re-appraising paranoid beliefs, she said.

For the primary outcome — changes in the GPTS-persecution score — there was no statistically significant difference between the groups, “but we found that both interventions groups improved over time, corresponding to an effect size of 0.9 — so quite a huge change,” Glenthøj reported.

For the secondary outcome, patients in the traditional CBT group had better scores on the emotional recognition latency measure. This was “rather unexpected and difficult to explain as the CBT manual did not comprise any aspect of training facial emotional recognition,” Glenthøj said.

Finally, on the exploratory outcomes of the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS) and Cognitive Disturbances Scale (COGDIS), the VR-CBT group had better scores, “but this must of course be seen in the context of potential multiple testing,” Glenthøj noted.

“You always have to interpret exploratory findings cautiously because when you have many outcomes, you are likely to get some positive findings that might be more or less random,” she told Medscape Medical News.

The findings suggest the possibility of equally effective, yet different options for this patient population.

“In clinical practice we found some patients benefitted highly from the VR approach because it was too difficult for them to work mainly with their cognition, as you do in regular CBT,” Glenthøj said. “Also, for some patients, the in-vivo exposure of regular CBT was too overwhelming, whereas the VR-therapy could deliver a highly fine-tuned and gradual exposure.”

While the differences between the two groups in the primary outcome were small, “this is not too surprising, as both deliver a treatment already known to be effective,” said Tom K. J Craig, MD, a pioneer of avatar therapy for this indication and emeritus professor of social psychiatry at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, England, who commented on the findings for Medscape Medical News.

“However, participants receiving VR-CBT improved more rapidly, particularly in terms of paranoid fears and avoidance, so needed fewer sessions. This gives a hint that VR-CBT may be more efficient way of delivering the therapy,” said Craig, who was not part of the study.

For the small but significant benefit for VR-CBT on the exploratory outcomes of the SIDAS and COGDIS subscores, he said, “it is a very small difference — but not no difference.”

VR offers another treatment option for psychiatric illness, but the technology won't replace human therapists, Craig said.

“There is already an automated VR-treatment for paranoia that has a virtual coach instead of a therapist, so you can see that there's directions and possibility for this, but we'll always need therapists,” Craig said.

“When you're working with something very hot, like threatening voices, that tell people to kill themselves or others, handing that over to automation feels too much. So even in our dream about AI, we will have a mental health professional on side with a patient, just watching what's happening and being able to stop it or to change it, if we need to,” Craig added.

Study funding was not disclosed. Glenthøj reported consultancies for Lundbeck Pharma, Boehringer-Ingelheim, and Khora VR. Craig reported research support from Wellcome Trust, and the National Institute for Health and Care Research. He is also an unpaid scientific advisor to AVATAR therapy.com.

Rilzabrutinib, an oral inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), demonstrated a rapid and substantial alleviation of symptoms in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) unresponsive to antihistamines at a dosage of 1200 mg/d compared with placebo.

“The results of this randomized clinical trial demonstrated that rilzabrutinib may be an effective BTKI [BTK inhibitor] with a favorable risk-benefit profile for the treatment of H1 antihistamine-refractory patients with CSU,” authors of the study wrote. More research is needed to “determine long-term efficacy and potential harms,” they added.

The study was led by Ana Giménez-Arnau, MD, PhD, Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain, and was published online on April 23 in JAMA Dermatology.

The study had a small sample size, limited racial diversity, a low number of omalizumab-incomplete responders, and a short duration of follow-up.

 April 23, 2025  

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said Tuesday it has become aware of reports of adverse events associated with compounded topical finasteride products, and it has issued an alert for healthcare providers, compounders, and consumers.

The agency is aware that some compounders and telemedicine platforms market topical finasteride either alone or with other active ingredients, such as finasteride combined with minoxidil, to treat hair loss, according to the alert.

There are only two FDA-approved oral finasteride products for different indications currently available in the United States: Proscar, approved in 1992, and Propecia, approved in 1997.

There is no FDA-approved topical formulation of finasteride, and compounded topical finasteride products do not have FDA-approved labeling, and “there are potential serious risks associated with the use of compounded topical finasteride products,” the FDA alert stated.

Between 2019 and 2024, 32 cases of adverse events associated with the use of compounded topical finasteride were reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System. Reported adverse events include those “consistent with those associated with the approved oral finasteride products,” such as erectile dysfunction, anxiety, suicidal ideation, brain fog, depression, fatigue, insomnia, decreased libido, and testicular pain following the use of compounded topical products with finasteride alone or combined with other active ingredients, according to the alert.

Most of the reports stated that the adverse events continued after use of the product was stopped.

“In some cases, consumers expressed they were not aware of the potential adverse events associated with the use of topical finasteride, and other patients reported that they were told by the prescribers that there was no risk of any adverse event because the product was topical,” the alert stated. “Some consumers,” the alert added, said that they “became very depressed, suffering with pain, and their lives were ruined because of these symptoms.”

Topical finasteride is also associated with other risks than those listed for oral formulations, according to the alert, such as local irritation, erythema, dryness/scaling, stinging and burning, and greater potential risk for exposing others to the product.

Exposure can be especially harmful to women. Approved finasteride products are contraindicated in pregnancy because they may cause abnormalities in male fetuses. “Studies have shown that women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets due to the possibility of absorption and the subsequent potential risk to a pregnancy,” the FDA stated.

FDA-approved finasteride tablets have a coating that prevents contact with finasteride during normal handling. But compounded topical finasteride products do not have a coating, and other compounded formulations may not have the coating.

The FDA recommends that healthcare providers educate patients on the risks of using compounded topical finasteride including the risks of inadvertently exposing pregnant women to the drug.

The FDA also encourages consumers, healthcare providers, and compounders to report adverse events or quality problems to the FDA at MedWatch: The FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program.

Hi, everyone. My name is Manasi Agrawal, and I am an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) physician and researcher at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. Today, I will be discussing the available evidence on environmental pollutants as triggers for Crohn's disease. 

Crohn's disease, as we know, is a growing global health challenge with rising incidence and prevalence across all age groups and worldwide. The rise in Crohn's disease in parallel with industrialization and globalization suggests that environmental factors play a crucial role.

Furthermore, Crohn's development is not a single-factor process; it results from cumulative exposures over time— that is, it is a consequence of multiple hits. The timing of exposure is also relevant. For example, the early-life period, which is considered to extend from prenatal life to early childhood, is a period of immune maturation and gut microbiome establishment. It is likely that exposures during this period set the stage for later exposures and downstream inflammatory response, ultimately leading to Crohn's disease onset. 

With this background, let's discuss the available evidence on different environmental pollutants and Crohn's disease. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are also called forever chemicals because their carbon fluoride bond resists degradation and they can remain in biological tissue for years to decades. PFAS are ubiquitous. They're found in fast-food packaging, nonstick cookware, waterproof clothing, and countless household items. They have been linked with many chronic diseases, including immune-mediated diseases. 

The DuPont Plant Occupational Cohort provided early evidence linking PFAS with IBD. Our study findings strengthened this connection. We measured all detectable PFAS as a mixture in serum samples from military recruits at multiple timepoints prior to IBD diagnosis. We found that per decile increase in PFAS mixture was associated with increased odds of Crohn's disease at each of these timepoints. 

Consistently, PFAS mixtures in dried blood spots from newborns also correlate with elevated fecal calprotectin, a marker of intestinal inflammation. Mechanistically, PFAS appear to impair intestinal barrier function and alter IgG glycosylation patterns, providing biological plausibility to these epidemiologic associations. 

Agricultural settings present another exposure pathway. In Northern France, researchers have observed Crohn's disease clustering in rural, intensely agricultural regions more so than urban areas. Similarly, data from a Danish nationwide study showed that early-life exposure to agricultural land use was associated with an increased risk for Crohn's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent data are also reported from the United States agricultural cohorts. 

Finally, we found that high pesticide exposure 6-10 years before disease onset was associated with an increased risk for Crohn's disease. Lab studies reinforce these findings. Using sophisticated screening methods, researchers have identified various cidal agents, particularly propyzamide, which is a common herbicide agent, as particularly damaging to the intestinal barrier. 

Micro- and nanoplastics also represent a ubiquitous modern exposure.While the former implies particles less than 5 mm in size, nanoplastics are considered to be less than 1 µm in size. These are present in contaminated seafood, food packaging, household personal-use items, tire dust, and even drinking water, to name a few exposure sources. These enter our body mainly via ingestion and inhalation.

For example, bottled water can contain hundreds of thousands of detectable nanoplastic particles, which is substantially higher than what has been reported previously. Nanoplastics are more difficult to measure relative to microplastics, and they're also more harmful because they deposit in biological tissue more easily and have a larger surface area for adsorbed chemicals.

Various studies, especially those done recently, have detected micro- and nanoplastics in human tissue like colon, liver, kidney, carotid artery plaques, brain, and placenta, and some studies have linked these to inflammation and related biomarkers. Mechanistic studies are also supportive, with evidence of gut microbiome changes and inflammation with microplastics exposure.

We are prospectively examining this relationship by following pregnant women with and without Crohn's disease and their children, measuring micro- and nanoplastics and intestinal inflammation markers in the PLANET study.

Early-life exposure to toxic metals is another important risk factor. We've measured metals in deciduous teeth as biomarkers of early-life exposure, and we found associations between certain metal categories and later risk for Crohn's disease. Nonessential metals like cadmium were associated with an increased risk, whereas essential metals like manganese appear to be protective. We are now conducting a larger study to understand this better. 

Furthermore, prenatal metal exposure can influence the baby's gut microbiome, and later, intestinal inflammation, suggesting that metals play a very important role in modulating early-life risk for later-onset disease.

Finally, air pollution (including early-life exposure), especially particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide, have been linked with Crohn's disease incidence and outcomes across multiple studies. Conversely, access to green space and biodiversity appears to be protective, with higher levels associated with a lower risk for Crohn's disease.

Mechanistic studies reveal common pathways across pollutant classes. All tend to disrupt tight junction proteins, increase intestinal permeability, and trigger inflammatory responses. This suggests that different environmental exposures may converge on shared pathologic mechanisms. Understanding these connections is very important toward preventive strategies.

We can better conceptualize prevention by considering levels. For example, tertiary implies early treatment to prevent complications and secondary indicates the importance of early diagnosis. We have made substantial strides in this area. 

Primary and primordial prevention are areas of unmet need. The former refers to prevention in at-risk persons, using environmental risk scores alongside genetic profiling to identify those who would benefit most from the intervention; whereas primordial prevention involves reducing risk factors in the general population through policy measures, like PFAS and microplastics regulation and air-quality improvement.

Practical mitigation strategies at the individual level include avoiding smoking; deterring single-use plastic, PFAS, and plastic-containing household items; improving water filtration systems; and encouraging healthy eating and green-space access, especially during pregnancy and early childhood. Emerging data suggest that fruits and vegetables containing antioxidants, as well as folic acid supplementation, may counteract some of the harmful effects of these pollutants, which is rather encouraging.

To address this at a community level, we need more research to unravel these relationships toward meaningful and pragmatic health policy change. Thank you for listening.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Dengue is one of the most common vector-borne viral diseases today, with ongoing outbreaks in Asia and Latin America. Its spread to North America highlights its global significance, as climate change and global warming increase the likelihood of its expansion into previously unaffected regions.

With the development and availability of new vaccines, policymakers must determine which are most suitable for at-risk populations. This session, presented at the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) 2025 in Vienna, Austria, explored the geographic distribution, clinical presentation, treatment algorithms, and potential use of current dengue vaccines.

In Brazil, dengue follows a seasonal pattern, peaking during the rainy season from October to May. Most cases occur in adults aged 20-59 years, with deaths primarily affecting individuals with comorbidities or those older than 60 years. Since 2010, all four serotypes have been circulating, but dengue virus (DENV) serotypes 1 (DENV-1) and 2 (DENV-2) have been most common recently.

However, 2024 has seen an unprecedented epidemic in terms of both case numbers and duration. Changes in dominant serotypes are believed to contribute to the surge in infections and shifts in disease severity.

In this context, controlling the dengue epidemic means reducing infectivity and protecting vulnerable individuals. Since mosquito vector control is complex and no specific treatment for dengue exists, vaccines are the key preventive tool. Expanding vaccine availability and including travelers in the susceptible population are crucial steps.

The speaker's team at this conference, from the Butantan Institute in São Paulo, Brazil, has been involved in the development of one of these vaccines. It is a tetravalent live-attenuated vaccine that covers all four dengue serotypes. The vaccine originated from the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases at the US National Institutes of Health, which licensed it to interested partners for further development. In 2018, Merck Sharp & Dohme Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and the Butantan Institute began a collaboration to advance the vaccine.

The ongoing phase 3 trial is a single-dose, placebo-controlled study that has enrolled more than 16,000 participants, who will be followed for a total of 5 years. The primary goal is to assess efficacy through polymerase chain reaction diagnosis of symptomatic dengue cases and to monitor for any potential vaccine-related adverse effects.

An interim analysis was conducted after 2 years of follow-up. Data are presented for DENV-1 and DENV-2, as these were the most prevalent during the latest epidemic, with no cases of DENV serotypes 3 or 4 detected during the study period.

One of the vaccine's key advantages is that it requires only a single dose, making it ideal for outbreak situations and enabling a rapid response. Although it is pending approval by the Brazilian government, it is expected to begin administration this year. It will take at least 5 years to produce enough doses to vaccinate the entire country.

The closure of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Division of Viral Hepatitis in the wake of the administration's restructuring of the Department of Health and Human Services leaves clinicians and public officials with no resources to process specimens and track outbreaks, according to several experts. 

The CDC's website for the National Center for HIV, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted disease, and tuberculosis exists, but is dated February 2, 2024. As reported by STAT, CDC employees working in surveillance and hepatitis control were retained, but all full-time staffers of the lab were cut. 

“The CDC's viral hepatitis lab is crucial to investigating viral hepatitis outbreaks and pinpointing the source of outbreaks,” said Shirin Mazumder, MD, an infectious diseases specialist in Memphis, Tennessee, in an interview.

“With the lab now dismantled, an outbreak situation cannot be properly investigated or contained, which means that infections can go unchecked and continue to spread. This has the potential to significantly impact the general population,” said Mazumder. 

The CDC's lab has played a role in several important areas of viral hepatitis research including contributing to hepatitis vaccine development and helping to identify new strains of viral hepatitis, Mazumder told Medscape Medical News. “The closure of this lab is a loss to public health advances, as well as viral hepatitis detection and prevention,” she added.

Despite its public health value, the lack of profitability in the work done by the CDC's viral hepatitis lab makes it less likely that other labs and agencies will pick up the slack, said Mazumder. “The lab conducts genomic analysis and tracing using a special type of program called Global Hepatitis Outbreak and Surveillance Technology (GHOST), which other states can access remotely to upload samples,” she noted. 

Individuals living with chronic hepatitis B will be affected by the cuts and closures as well, with reduced access to essential services for prevention, testing, and treatment, said Chari A. Cohen, DrPH, MPH, president of the nonprofit Hepatitis B Foundation, in a statement.

“Confusion, fear, and poor preparedness will be the consequence of the changes that have been so rapidly imposed, putting us all at risk,” said Cohen.

As reported by CBS News, CDC employees have said that the abrupt closure of the division did not allow for proper shutdown of labs, and that specimens were still being delivered for testing.

“Hepatitis B and C can pose a hazard due to the potential exposure that can occur from blood products and other bodily fluids,” Mazumder told Medscape Medical News. “Care and specific precautions must be taken when handling these samples,” she emphasized.

If the laboratory capacity of the CDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis is closed or limited, “it would impair the sophistication and thoroughness with which some outbreak investigations could be conducted,” said William Schaffner, MD, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, in an interview.

Simple diagnosis of hepatitis A, B, and C occurs in every hospital in the country, and state and local laboratories provide a great deal of information, Schaffner said. However, “there are times when you would like the more sophisticated molecular fingerprinting to make more precise conclusions and bring an outbreak to a close,” he said.

For example, local public health departments working on outbreaks that they suspect might be related would need a more sophisticated lab for molecular testing to determine whether cases are part of a single outbreak. Without advanced testing, it might be harder to tie cases together epidemiologically, he said. If epidemiologists remain in place for hepatitis work at the CDC but lack access to the laboratory, their capacity to make precise conclusions will be limited, and there will be less certainty that an outbreak has been brought to a close, Schaffner explained.

Regardless of the status of the CDC's hepatitis lab, clinicians should continue to be vigilant to signs of hepatitis and immediately contact their local and state health department, Schaffner told Medscape Medical News. “It is often the alert and informed clinician who reports to local health departments that can get involved and conduct community investigations to prevent further spread,” he emphasized.

Mazumder and Schaffner had no financial conflicts to disclose.

Threats from the Trump administration to impose significant tariffs on European goods, potentially including pharmaceuticals, have cast a shadow of uncertainty over the transatlantic trade relationship. This comes against a backdrop of already booming pharmaceutical exports from European Union (EU) member states to the United States, such as Ireland, which recently witnessed a 450% surge from €1.9 billion in February 2024 to €10.5 billion in February this year.

These external pressures add fresh urgency to ongoing debates within the EU about how to best regulate its own pharmaceutical sector, balancing industry competitiveness with patient welfare.

“It's vital that medicines remain as accessible as possible to the UK and global markets. Patients should not end up the casualties in a global trade war,” Alwyn Fortune, the policy lead for the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's Medicines Shortages Advisory Group, London, England, told Medscape Medical News. “Supply chain vulnerabilities make it harder for patients to access treatment, causing frustration, anxiety, and, in some cases, harm to patient health.”

Even before recent trade threats emerged, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) advocated for substantial policy reforms to maintain Europe's position as a hub for innovation, particularly against competition from the United States and China. Their requests fall into four main categories:

Medscape Medical News reached out to the European Commission spokesperson responsible for health and to the EMA. They both declined an interview.

While the industry focuses on competitiveness and innovation, frontline physicians stress the immediate impact of system pressures on patient well-being. Tiago Villanueva, a family physician in Portugal and the president of the European Union of General Practitioners, highlighted medicine shortages as the primary concern arising from the current uncertainty.

“Any issue with shortages of medicines may compromise the quality of patient care because you are forced to use medicines that may not be as effective,” Villanueva told Medscape Medical News.

Fortune agreed. “Our report on medicines shortages highlighted that increasing regulatory divergence between the UK and EU is adding to supply chain problems. The ongoing review of EU pharmaceutical regulation will inevitably have implications for the UK.”

Villanueva said shortages and high costs drive a worrying trend: Patients seeking medicines online. This “is not a risk. That's already happening,” warned Villanueva. Patients turn to “very doubtful places” online, primarily due to the lack of availability of prescribed drugs like Ozempic or to look for newer, expensive weight loss medications not covered by national health systems. The danger is significant. “You cannot be sure that it's going to be a trustworthy medicine. It could be counterfeit. It could be less effective. It could be actually something else.”

Despite industry calls for faster drug approvals, Villanueva expressed confidence in the existing regulatory safeguards. “We should have full trust in our European medicines regulator,” he said, believing that expedited processes seen during the pandemic streamlined bureaucracy without compromising rigorous safety checks.

While promoting innovation is crucial, he argued, it must be balanced with rigorous testing and ensuring access to safe, reliable medicines through a strong regulatory framework. “Above all, patient care and safety are the most important things.”

Villanueva reported no relevant financial relationships.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hello everybody, and welcome back. My name is Teresa Amaral, and I'm really happy to be here with you again on this Medscape melanoma series. 

In our last episode, we discussed biomarkers and the importance of biomarkers, especially in the adjuvant setting. I hope you enjoyed the presentations and the discussion.

Today, I'm going to show you why it is important to have these biomarkers in the adjuvant setting. One of the reasons these biomarkers are important, and we need to better select the patients that should be recommended to receive adjuvant therapy, is because we still don't know which patients would benefit from adjuvant therapy. We also don't know which patients should receive adjuvant therapy based on the data that were presented recently about neoadjuvant therapy in patients with microscopic disease. 

On that topic and because this discussion is a very important one that's been ongoing for quite some time, my colleagues and I decided to look into this question and to write about it. Today, I'm going to bring you a little bit about our reflections on where we are going to move next in terms of adjuvant immunotherapy in patients with melanoma. 

The title of this publication is “Adjuvant Immunotherapy in the Modern Management of Resectable Melanoma: Current Status and Outlook to 2028.” The reason why it's 2028, you will understand in a couple of seconds. This piece was published in ESMO Open and it's open access, so you can look into that and make your own conclusions about what we discuss here. 

The first question is: Who are the patients that are candidates for adjuvant therapy in the era of neoadjuvant therapy?

First of all, we will have patients that have macroscopic disease. Macroscopic disease has been defined as disease that we can see clinically by inspecting the body of the patient, but also disease that can be seen using radiologic assessments such as ultrasound, MRI, CT, and PET-CT. 

These patients will, in principle, be candidates for receiving neoadjuvant therapy because we have seen that patients who have this type of disease and receive this therapy have a better outcome than patients that receive adjuvant therapy alone. Still, there will be a significant proportion of patients who are diagnosed with stage IIIB or higher disease that are not candidates for neoadjuvant therapy because they have what we call microscopic disease. 

What is microscopic disease? It's a disease that is present, but we cannot detect it clinically or radiologically, which means that we will most likely propose a sentinel lymph node biopsy to these patients. The sentinel lymph node biopsy, or even removing more than one lymph node, will show in the pathology that these patients indeed have a metastatic disease that is not seen using only clinical assessment. These patients, as I said before, will be candidates for adjuvant therapy, but not for neoadjuvant therapy. 

How many patients will be candidates for adjuvant therapy but not neoadjuvant therapy? We looked into these numbers and, most likely, this will vary depending on the country that we are looking into, but it should be around 40% based on the national registries for which we have data. These patients will be the ones who will be candidates to receive adjuvant therapy, and there might be more candidates, depending on how we define microscopic disease.

Moreover, there will be patients who are diagnosed with stage IIIA disease and patients with stage IIB and IIC disease that will still be candidates for adjuvant therapy and, at this time point, not candidates for neoadjuvant therapy, although there are some trials investigating neoadjuvant therapy also in the setting.

Finally, we will have patients who have been treated with neoadjuvant therapy that have then received surgical resection. For those who didn't have a major pathologic response, most likely we'll also provide adjuvant therapy. In the end, we will have a group of patients with different characteristics who will be candidates for adjuvant therapy, but not for neoadjuvant therapy.

Why were these adjuvant therapies approved? For those who are less familiar with adjuvant therapy in melanoma, these therapies were approved initially for stage III disease in 2018 to 2019, including pembrolizumab for stage III disease and nivolumab for stage III and stage IV disease. Later on, in 2022 and 2023, immunotherapy was approved for stage IIB and stage IIC disease in a number of countries, at least in Europe. 

These therapies are obviously currently part of the discussion in terms of adjuvant therapy between patients and their physicians, and they should be discussed with the patients based on the benefit that they can provide.

All of these therapies were proved based on a benefit in terms of relapse-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival that favors therapy with PD-1 [agents] vs placebo. These therapies provided a benefit that was associated with a risk reduction of approximately 40%, considering a combined endpoint that was a combined event defined by recurrence or death.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

As part of my standard intake, I usually ask patients to inform me of their highest weight (excluding pregnancy), nadir weight, and ideal body weight. Generally, patients don't hesitate to answer these basic questions, but last Friday I saw a patient who 6 months prior had looked very surprised when I inquired as to her ideal body weight. She had raised an eyebrow and politely informed me her weight loss journey was not about cosmetics. 

Accordingly, her ideal body weight was whatever weight resolved her metabolic syndrome (high blood pressure, prediabetes, high cholesterol) and sleep apnea. She preferred to skip weigh-ins and didn't want the stress of trying to reach an arbitrary weight target. While somewhat unusual for my patient population, I couldn't argue with her logic. 

After 24 weeks of a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) drug, proper nutrition, and regular exercise, her blood pressure this past Friday had decreased to the normal range (without medications), and her cholesterol and blood sugar levels had normalized. 

In addition, she reported improved sleep quality and that her “husband no longer complains about snoring.” Her weight had decreased from 216 lb to 158 lb. At 5 ft 1 in, she is still considerably overweight. However, she was not interested in further weight loss since her initial goals had been met. 

Coincidentally, a study abstract published on April 2, 2025, suggested this exact same principle — that weight loss programs should consider many factors beyond percent body weight, including improvement in weight-related complications, enhanced quality of life, and better physical and social functioning. 

The study reviewed 30 trials published between 1992 and 2024. Weight loss goal in these trials ranged from 3% to 10%, but achieved weight loss was typically far lower. However, the authors suggest that patients should not feel like they have “failed” to reach set goals when health outcomes improve. 

Given the myriad health complications from obesity, perhaps we need to reevaluate our targets for obesity management and focus more on improving comorbidities and quality of life.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

According to a recent meta-analysis, higher-dose tuberculosis treatment regimens in children, following 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, were associated with significantly higher rates of adverse events than lower-dose treatment regimens.

“Pediatric-specific counselling should be developed and evaluated to minimize severe AEs [adverse events], including advice to discontinue medication and seek care when encountering symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Patient education, a key factor in promoting adherence to TB [tuberculosis] treatment, should also include information about side effects and an action plan if they occur to ensure treatment safety,” authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Michael Prodanuk, Division of Infectious Diseases, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was published online on March 24, 2025, in Clinical Infectious Diseases.

The findings were limited by publication bias in observational trials, as well as substantial heterogeneity between studies, varying definitions of adverse events, and differing monitoring practices between studies. Additionally, the analysis was constrained by the low number of participants living with HIV and the limited reporting of comorbidities such as malnutrition.

This study was supported by the Canadian Paediatric Society's Section on Respiratory Medicine trainee grant and the Edwin S.H. Leong Centre for Healthy Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The authors declared no conflicts of interest.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Matthew F.  Watto, MD: Welcome back to The Curbsiders. I'm Dr Matthew Frank Watto, here with my great friend and America's primary care physician, Dr Paul Nelson Williams. 

We recently had the fantastic hepatologist Dr Scott Matherly on the show to update us on cirrhosis. Paul, when should we think about cirrhosis? And what patients are at risk? 

Paul N. Williams, MD: I mean, we should be thinking about cirrhosis all the time — obviously. But in all seriousness, we're encouraged to not be afraid of the liver. 

Matt, I think we typically have two classic patient populations who are at risk for cirrhosis: patients with a history of heavy alcohol use and, increasingly, patients who have metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).

However, Dr Matherly mentioned a patient population that I had forgotten I should keep an eye out for: patients with a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass who have a history of alcohol use or ongoing alcohol use. The Roux-en-Y procedure itself increases your risk for liver damage from alcohol use. It's a risk factor that I feel like I knew at some point, but forgot about until Dr Matherly reminded me. And these patients are not an insubstantial population to be thinking about. These medical histories can serve as cues to at least start thinking about cirrhosis.

Sometimes, you may see signs of cirrhosis on laboratory findings. For example, you might inherit a patient and discover that they've had chronically low platelets with no concrete explanation. As you do your workup, laboratory findings may confirm your suspicion of cirrhosis, and then you have to kind of reverse engineer how they got to that point.

Watto: Dr Matherly taught us that if you think a patient might have cirrhosis, look at the international normalized ratio (INR) and low platelets as earlier signs in the labs. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels of 20-25 for women and 30-35 for men are not normal. So, if your lab has its upper limit of normal set to 40, that doesn't fly with Dr Matherly or any hepatologist that we've talked to.

We also talked about how he reevaluates liver imaging on his own. Now, I'm not a hepatologist, so I'm probably not going to be able to look at CT scans to gauge whether the portal vein is enlarged. But look at the imaging, because sometimes patients get labeled with cirrhosis and don't have any of the lab findings to support the diagnosis. They might just have a nodular appearing liver, but you want to look for other clues. So, if the radiologist comments on the size of the spleen or the portal vein, these can be useful markers, but you may want to have a follow-up call with the radiology to ask for more information. If you get signs of cirrhosis on a CT scan, try to find other supporting information to clarify the diagnosis. Don't just immediately assume it's definitively cirrhosis.

Williams: Importantly, we also took the conversation in the opposite direction, as well: Sometimes cirrhosis can be ignored. Perhaps you have a patient who had CTs ordered for another condition but when you go back to the records, you find that their old CTs have evidence of a nodular liver and evidence of portal hypertension. Don't just sit on those. Have a conversation with radiologists and ask, “Is this real?” and “What should I do with this information?” But don't ignore these signs, because the longer a patient goes without treatment, the worse their prognosis is.

Watto: During our episode about MASLD, we talked about how a high Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis score can make us want to get elastography. Elastography can then help us determine how much fibrosis is present in the liver. However, it seems like in the field of hepatology, if a patient presents with a high FIB-4 score and high elastography numbers, hepatologists will treat them as if they have cirrhosis, even without a liver biopsy to further confirm.

Paul, what treatment is preferred if we're worried about esophageal varices? We used to always give, nadolol or certain nonspecific beta-blockers. But what's in vogue these days?

Williams: It's carvedilol. I feel like there's been buzz about this medication for a little while now, but it's always nice to hear from our hepatology colleagues that this is indeed what they are using in their practice. 

Carvedilol is a little bit easier to dose, is simpler to titrate — it's almost a “set it and forget it” medication. When starting patients on carvedilol, you begin with 6.25 mg daily for a couple of days. Then, if patients tolerate that amount, you can titrate to twice daily. Carvedilol seems to be easier to manage and has better supporting evidence in terms of reducing decompensation and mortality risk. That's the way the pendulum seems to be swinging now, as opposed to those nonselective beta-blockers that you mentioned, Matt.

Watto: The way the alpha blockade works on the portal pressures seems to be more effective than just the beta-blockers alone, which was news to me. Honestly, I've still been seeing patients on nadolol and I didn't realize carvedilol was now becoming the drug of choice for portal hypertension.

Paul, we talked to Dr Matherly about some of the general lifestyle counseling that you would give a patient who has cirrhosis. I think many providers think, “Okay, there's problems with the liver. I have to be super-strict with my patient about salt intake and they shouldn't eat too much protein.”

But actually, Dr Matherly says he's “pro-calorie” and “pro-protein” in patients with cirrhosis because they're so prone to muscle wasting. He really even tries to avoid prolonged periods of fasting for this patient population and will advise these patients to eat an apple with peanut butter before bedtime so that they're not fasting overnight. I was shocked at how important it is to make sure they're getting enough calories and enough protein. 

As far as sodium goes, he's not too militant about restricting patients to, say, less than 2 g of sodium per day because he doesn't want the diet to be so bland that patients aren't able to eat enough calories and protein. So, he's willing to compromise a little bit on the sodium restriction. However, for patients with ascites, higher priority should be given to reducing sodium intake because a lot of that is going to end up in the belly and their ascites will be worse. But overall, he's not too militant about sodium.

I know people are always worried about acetaminophen in patients with chronic liver disease. Is acetaminophen safe for patients with cirrhosis?

Williams: I don't know about you, Matt, but I feel like I hear this question all the time. Patients will come in and say they know they can't take acetaminophen because they've got cirrhosis or they've got fatty liver disease.

But acetaminophen use is actually safe in patients with cirrhosis. In fact, it's still preferred over other analgesics, as long as you keep it to 2 g or less per day — which is a reasonable dose, it's not nothing. So, you can give your blessing to take up to 2 g of acetaminophen per day because that is known to be a safe dose. If it helps them, all the better.

The other medication that I see individuals hesitate about are statins. I think providers are scared to give statins to patients who have abnormal liver enzymes, and they become even more nervous with a diagnosis of cirrhosis. With cirrhosis, some providers may be tempted to pull the statins.

Yet, there may be a benefit to using statins for cirrhosis and certainly for fatty liver diseases. Dr Matherly does point out that these patients are prone to sarcopenia and might be a bit more prone to some of the muscle symptoms, so do be a little cautious. But cirrhosis in and of itself is not a reason to discontinue statins; in fact, there's probably some benefit to continuing statin use.

Watto: That is such an important point. I see so many patients pulled off statins as soon as there are any changes in liver enzymes or any presence of liver disease. Hepatologists seem to love the statins. 

And finally, when should we refer? 

If a patient has decompensated liver cirrhosis — meaning they've had bleeding from varices, they have hepatic encephalopathy, they have ascites — have a poor prognosis and need to be following up with a hepatologist. These patients can get really sick, really fast. They may even be listed for transplant because they need a safety net.

A sweeping global review shows that the Mediterranean diet significantly reduces breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women, with Asian populations seeing the strongest effects, highlighting the diet's potential as a strategic prevention tool.

Review: Adherence to Mediterranean Diet and Breast Cancer Risk: A Meta-Analysis of Prospective Observational Studies. Image Credit: Sea Wave / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Health Science Reports, researchers evaluated the associations between adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) and breast cancer risk.

Breast cancer is a significant public health concern, accounting for a substantial proportion of cancer diagnoses among women. As such, exploring effective prevention strategies remains crucial, focusing on lifestyle factors, such as diet. The MD has drawn substantial research interest due to its associations with health benefits. Moreover, studies suggest an inverse relationship between adherence to the MD and breast cancer risk, albeit some inconsistencies remain. The mechanisms underlying this relationship may include the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of the diet, as well as hormonal factors, particularly in postmenopausal women.

In the present study, researchers examined the evidence on the relationship between the MD and breast cancer risk. First, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for case-control and cohort studies examining adherence to the MD and its association with breast cancer risk. They also reported risk estimates using odds, relative, or hazard ratios.

Studies that lacked quantitative data, non-original studies (e.g., reviews), and those involving other dietary patterns were excluded. Next, relevant data from studies were extracted; these included sample size, participant characteristics (age, menopausal status), dietary assessment methods and duration, alcohol intake, and risk estimates. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).

Further, the meta-analysis was performed by pooling risk estimates comparing the lowest and highest levels of MD adherence. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I-squared statistic, and publication bias was examined using Funnel plots and Begg's test. In addition, the team performed subgroup analyses by study design, regions, and menopausal status to analyze whether these variables modified risk estimates. The researchers also conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of their findings and examined the impact of adjusting for alcohol consumption, an element of the Mediterranean diet whose role in breast cancer risk is debated.

The comprehensive database search yielded 2,189 records. Following deduplication and title/abstract screening, full texts of 43 studies were reviewed, resulting in the inclusion of 31 studies. These included 19 case-control and 12 cohort studies published between 2006 and 2023. Participants were aged 20–104 years across studies.

The quality of included studies was generally high, with case-control and cohort studies scoring 3–9 and 6–9 on the NOS, respectively. The meta-analysis indicated a significant association between MD adherence and lower breast cancer risk overall, with substantial heterogeneity across studies. However, for premenopausal women, there was no significant risk reduction, with some heterogeneity across studies.

By contrast, for postmenopausal women, there was a significant decrease in breast cancer risk associated with adherence to the MD, with moderate heterogeneity. Further, cohort studies with less than and over 20 years of follow-up showed no significant differences in breast cancer risk. By geographical region, studies performed in Asia showed the strongest associations between MD adherence and breast cancer risk.

European studies showed moderate associations, while American studies had insignificant associations. For premenopausal women in cohort studies, the MD had no effect on breast cancer risk; likewise, the marginal association in case-control studies appeared overestimated. By region, premenopausal women had no significant risk reduction across Asia, the Americas, or Europe.

For postmenopausal women in cohort studies, there was a modest decrease in breast cancer risk associated with MD adherence, while a stronger protective effect was noted in case-control studies. Moreover, there was a moderate risk reduction in Europeans, a weaker, insignificant reduction in Americans, and a stronger association in Asians.

The analysis also found that including or excluding alcohol as a component of the Mediterranean diet influenced the magnitude of risk reduction in some subgroups, especially among postmenopausal women, highlighting the complex and still-debated role of alcohol in breast cancer prevention.

A leave-one-out sensitivity analysis found no outlier studies, supporting the robustness of the findings.

Limitations of the study include differences in findings between cohort and case-control studies, with case-control studies generally showing a stronger association but also having a higher risk of recall bias and other methodological challenges. Additionally, variations in how the Mediterranean diet is defined and implemented across different regions—often due to cultural factors—may have contributed to inconsistent results. The authors note that further research should consider breast cancer subtypes, hormone receptor status, genetic predispositions, and lifestyle factors to more fully understand the potential protective role of the Mediterranean diet.

In sum, the findings of the meta-analysis indicate a 13% lower risk of breast cancer associated with adherence to the MD, especially in postmenopausal women. There were no significant effects for premenopausal women. Geographically, Asian populations had the strongest protective effects, with moderate associations in Europeans and Americans. While these results suggest that the MD may be a promising diet to prevent breast cancer, the authors emphasize the need for additional, well-designed studies across diverse populations and regions, and taking into account the complexity of diet composition and other risk factors.

New analysis shows that pairing a low-sodium diet with DASH eating habits reduces cardiovascular risk by over 14%, with the biggest wins for women and Black adults facing high blood pressure.

Study: Dietary sodium reduction lowers 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score: Results from the DASH-sodium trial. Image Credit: New Africa / Shutterstock

In a recent article published in the American Journal of Preventive Cardiology, researchers used data collected in the United States to investigate how reducing sodium in the diet, either in isolation or while following the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, affects the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) over 10 years.

Their findings indicate that adherence to DASH dietary patterns and reducing dietary sodium independently reduced the risk of ASCVD, with the greatest benefits observed when the two interventions were combined.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of mortality, but over half of the cases are linked to modifiable lifestyle factors such as physical activity and diet. Across the U.S., unhealthy dietary habits, particularly excessive sodium intake, which more than 90% of American adults exceed, are major contributors to poor cardiovascular health.

The DASH diet, which is endorsed by national recommendations, encourages the intake of low-fat dairy, whole grains, vegetables, and fruits while reducing the consumption of added sugars, cholesterol, and saturated fats. It has been associated with lower CVD incidence, reduced cardiac injury, and decreased 10-year ASCVD risk.

While a previous trial called DASH-Sodium showed that both the DASH diet and sodium reduction were effective in improving blood pressure, their effects on the long-term risk of ASCVD were not analyzed.

In this study, researchers conducted a secondary analysis using data collected during the DASH-Sodium project to evaluate whether reducing sodium intake, alone or alongside the DASH diet, could lower the risk of ASCVD over ten years.

The researchers hypothesized that decreasing sodium consumption would reduce risk alone and that combining it with DASH dietary approaches would have an additive effect.

The DASH-Sodium project was a randomized, multi-center feeding study conducted between 1997 and 1999 in four U.S. clinical sites. It enrolled adults with elevated blood pressure who were at least 22 years old, while excluding those with insulin-dependent diabetes, heart disease, renal insufficiency, poorly controlled dyslipidemia, excessive alcohol intake, or those on antihypertensive medications. Participants were randomized to follow the DASH diet or an average American diet over 12 weeks. Each participant consumed three sodium levels—high, meaning 1.6 mg of sodium for each kilocalorie consumed (about 3,500 mg/day for a 2,000 kcal diet), medium (1.1 mg per kilocalorie, about 2,400 mg/day), or low (0.5 mg per kilocalorie, about 1,150 mg/day)—in random order. Each sodium level was consumed for about 30 days, with washout periods in between.

The study provided all meals, ensuring consistent nutrient intake. The highest sodium intake represented typical American consumption, while the medium matched guideline limits, and the lowest level was below the recommended intake.

The primary outcome was the ASCVD risk score over ten years, calculated using the Pooled Cohort Equation (PCE). Static risk factors like age and smoking were measured at baseline, while dynamic variables such as blood pressure and cholesterol were measured after each period of feeding.

Blood samples and blood pressure readings were collected using standardized methods. Data were analyzed using mixed effects models, accounting for repeated measures. Sensitivity analyses addressed participants outside the PCE's valid range by imputing or excluding out-of-range values. Stratified analyses assessed outcomes by age, sex, race, hypertension status, obesity, and smoking.

It is important to note that each sodium intervention period lasted only 30 days. While this allowed for controlled measurement of short-term changes in ASCVD risk scores, it does not provide evidence about the long-term impact of sustained dietary changes.

Among 390 participants, baseline characteristics were similar across the control and DASH diet groups. The DASH diet led to a greater reduction in the estimated ASCVD risk over ten years compared to the control diet, with an absolute difference of −0.12% and a relative difference of −5.33%.

Sodium reduction further decreased ASCVD risk, with low sodium intake showing greater risk reductions than medium or high sodium intake. Combined DASH diet and low sodium intake resulted in the largest decrease in ASCVD risk, with an absolute difference of −0.35%, and a relative difference of −14.09% compared to the control diet, which was high in sodium.

Stratified analysis showed stronger sodium reduction effects in women, Black adults, and those with stage 2 hypertension, while no significant differences were seen by age, obesity, or smoking status. Sensitivity analyses supported these findings.

The study also noted that race was dichotomized as Black versus non-Black, so effects among other minoritized groups could not be determined.

The DASH diet significantly lowered the estimated 10-year ASCVD risk compared to a typical American diet. Sodium reduction further reduced risk, especially when combined with the DASH diet, with greater benefits among women, Black adults, and those with stage 2 hypertension.

These results align with previous evidence supporting DASH and sodium reduction for cardiovascular health. However, no long-term randomized trials have confirmed DASH's effect on actual CVD events, as most evidence is based on risk factor and risk score reduction, not direct clinical outcomes. The optimal sodium intake level also remains debated.

Nevertheless, even moderate sodium reductions appeared beneficial, reinforcing public health efforts to reduce sodium intake. The authors note that the study's exclusion criteria (such as individuals with existing heart disease, diabetes, or those on antihypertensive drugs) and the relatively short intervention periods may limit the generalizability of the findings. Future research should focus on long-term outcomes, include a broader range of participants, and further refine sodium intake guidelines.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Insights into Raman spectroscopy as a bioprocess analytical technique","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250423/Insights-into-Raman-spectroscopy-as-a-bioprocess-analytical-technique.aspx","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 07:52:00 GMT","

In this interview, Dr. Nimesh Khadka, Senior Product Application Specialist at Thermo Fisher Scientific, explores the role of Raman spectroscopy as a process analytical tool (PAT) in bioprocess monitoring, highlighting its molecular specificity, real-time capabilities, and advantages over traditional analytical methods like ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy.

Raman spectroscopy is a technique that examines how light interacts with molecules. When light interacts with vibrating molecules, most of it bounces unchanged – this is called a Rayleigh scattering. However, a small portion of the light shifts in energy because the molecules absorb or release small amounts of energy as they vibrate—this is known as Raman scattering. Although this scattered light is faint, it carries unique molecular fingerprints, helping scientists identify and measure different substances with precision.

Raman spectroscopy offers molecular specificity, which means it can identify molecules based on their distinct spectral fingerprints. Raman also works well in water-based solutions since water has a weak Raman signal. Because it's an optical and non-destructive technique, it can take frequent, data-rich measurements without affecting the sample. This helps to capture process variations in real-time. Raman can also detect multiple metabolites in a single scan without degrading samples, making it invaluable for dynamic bioprocess environments.

In addition, Raman spectroscopy can detect several key protein features, including amide I, II, and III regions, which reveal details about peptide bonds and secondary structures. Raman also picks up aromatic residues like phenylalanine and tryptophan, as well as disulfide bonds. These insights help scientists monitor protein behavior, detect aggregation, and assess structural configurations.

The speed of Raman analysis is particularly beneficial in bioprocessing. Real-time monitoring enables precise process control, such as initiating UF/DF at specific protein concentrations. It helps maintain consistent product quality, reduces costs, and saves time. Further, Raman can simultaneously monitor multiple parameters at once, enhancing understanding of bioprocess dynamics for better decision-making.

UV-Vis spectroscopy can be affected by other substances in the sample, such as tryptophan, leading to inaccurate protein concentration measurements. In contrast, Raman spectroscopy is unaffected by these interferences, ensuring more reliable data. It can also quantify proteins and excipients like sucrose and histidine in a single scan, giving a more complete picture of the process.

For example, we performed an experiment focused on monitoring protein concentrations during ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) in downstream monoclonal antibody production. Raman's performance was compared with in-line UV-Vis and at-line UV-Vis. The results showed Raman's high accuracy (less than 5% error) and showcased its ability to deliver reliable data even in the presence of interfering compounds like tryptophan.

In addition, Raman spectroscopy is highly specific, detecting only the target molecules without interference from others. In our experiment, UV-Vis overestimated protein concentrations by more than 70% due to tryptophan interference. In contrast, Raman accurately measured concentrations with less than 10% error since tryptophan did not affect the Raman signals in the targeted spectral regions.

Raman can be integrated into bioprocesses in three ways: in-line, at-line, or on-line. In-line uses immersible probes placed directly in the process for real-time monitoring and control. At-line requires taking samples for analysis off-line, while on-line involves sampling tubes to transport material to the Raman instrument. In-line Raman is most effective for continuous data collection and process control, ensuring consistent product quality.

There can be challenges with Raman analysis including baseline shifts, path length differences, and spectral overlaps. These issues are managed using data pre-processing techniques such as baseline removal (using filters like Savitzky-Golay) and normalization (e.g., water band normalization). Dimensionality reduction techniques like Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression help build robust chemometric models for accurate predictions.

Yes, Raman goes beyond basic monitoring to support crucial bioprocess quality control, such as deconvoluting protein secondary structures and quantifying protein aggregation. Raman can isolate protein-specific spectra from excipient interference and analyze beta-sheet content or aggregation profiles in real-time, proving deeper insights into process stability and product quality.

Yes, process Raman spectroscopy is a versatile tool for real-time monitoring and control in bioprocessing. Unlike traditional methods such as UV-Vis, it provides molecularly specific, non-destructive measurements, even in complex mixtures. Its application ensures high-quality outcomes in both upstream and downstream processes, making it a reliable and cost-effective solution for the biopharmaceutical industry.

Dr. Nimesh Khadka is a Senior Product Application Specialist at Thermo Fisher Scientific and holds a PhD in Biochemistry focusing on bioanalytical techniques.

With extensive expertise in spectroscopy and chemometrics, he is committed to driving innovation through process analytical technology (PAT). Dr. Khadka is particularly passionate about addressing complex challenges in bioprocessing by leveraging advanced tools. Currently, he is at the forefront of promoting Raman spectroscopy as a practical and effective solution for monitoring and controlling bioprocesses within the realm of PAT.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New biomarkers identified for early detection of gynecological cancer","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250423/New-biomarkers-identified-for-early-detection-of-gynecological-cancer.aspx","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 16:35:00 GMT","

Researchers from the University of Skövde, the University of Gothenburg, and the Sahlgrenska Academy have significantly advanced early detection of gynecological cancer. They have identified biomarkers that can indicate if someone has cancer. This discovery enables faster healthcare responses, thereby increasing the patient's chances of survival.

Each year, approximately 325,000 women receive a life-altering diagnosis of gynaecological cancer. For those who develop ovarian cancer, the future is often uncertain; only half survive five years after diagnosis. When cancer is detected late, survival rates drop drastically. However, there is now a glimmer of hope.

The research has made crucial progress by identifying specific biomarkers that allow for early detection of gynaecological cancer. This new discovery could eventually be integrated into healthcare, improving the chances of successful treatment.

We have identified several protein variants that can help distinguish between benign and malignant tumors. We are currently testing a panel of genetic changes to further enhance the accuracy of our diagnoses.""

Benjamin Ulfenborg, Senior Lecturer in BioInformatics, University of Skövde

Cancer can hide in the body for a long time before symptoms appear, making early diagnosis challenging. The research team employs a technique combining protein analysis and genetic changes. These biological markers act as the body's own warning signals, capable of revealing the disease long before it spreads.

A specific part of the research targets women with endometriosis, a chronic condition affecting about one in ten women of reproductive age. The researchers have found that certain genetic alterations are shared between endometriosis and cancer, providing new insights into which patients may be at greater risk of developing cancer later.

""For these women, our research could lead to more personalised monitoring and earlier detection of potential cancer changes,"" says Benjamin Ulfenborg.

The method being developed by the researchers offers several advantages. Early cancer detection can save lives and reduce the need for extensive surgical interventions and treatments with severe side effects, granting patients more years of good health and better quality of life.

""Our goal is for this method to be routinely used in healthcare. By detecting cancer at an early stage, we can prevent unnecessary suffering and give more women the opportunity to live healthier lives,"" adds Benjamin Ulfenborg.

The project is a collaboration between several research groups. The University of Gothenburg and the Sahlgrenska Academy provide clinical samples and genetic analyses, while the University of Skövde contributes expertise in bioinformatics and statistical modelling. Together, they develop algorithms capable of handling large volumes of biological data to improve diagnostics. Research on early diagnosis is crucial to improving survival rates.

""Every success in this field gives more women a chance to survive their disease and live longer, healthier lives,"" concludes Benjamin Ulfenborg.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia associated with thinner retinas","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250422/Genetic-susceptibility-to-schizophrenia-associated-with-thinner-retinas.aspx","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 02:45:00 GMT","

A new study led by the University of Zurich has shown that evidence of genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia can be found in the retina. This finding could help improve the early detection of the disorder.

The retina is part of the central nervous system and therefore a direct extension of the brain. This is why changes in the brain could potentially also be detected in our eyes. An international team of researchers led by the University of Zurich and the University Hospital of Psychiatry Zurich has now tackled this very question. In their study, the researchers examined whether changes in our nerve connections are linked to a genetic risk for schizophrenia, as impaired neural information processing is one of the main characteristics of the disorder.

Previous studies suggest that schizophrenia not only reduces volume of gray matter in the brains of those affected, but that it also leads to loss of retinal tissue. However, whether these changes are the cause of schizophrenia or a consequence of the disorder has remained unanswered. Retinal health could also be affected by schizophrenia itself, for example through antipsychotic medication, lifestyle factors or diabetes.

To investigate whether the risk of developing schizophrenia has an effect on the central nervous system, we examined tens of thousands of healthy individuals. We then calculated polygenic risk scores for each individual.""

Finn Rabe, first author of the study and postdoc, University of Zurich

The researchers were able to use extensive genetic and retinal data taken from the UK Biobank, a large biomedical database containing data from over half a million people. ""You could say that the scale of the UK Biobank's data has revolutionized biomedical research,"" the researcher adds.

The study shows that higher genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia is indeed associated with thinner retinas. However, the effects are small and can only be reliably demonstrated in large-scale studies. One of the study's findings is that, unlike changes in the brain, changes in the retina are easy to detect using non-invasive and inexpensive retinal measurements. Thanks to optical coherence tomography, which can be described as a kind of ultrasound for the eye, retinal thickness can be measured within a matter of minutes.

This offers a promising outlook for prevention. ""Our study shows the potential of using optical coherence tomography in clinical practice. But large-scale longitudinal studies are needed to examine how useful it will be for prevention,"" says Finn Rabe.

Another key finding of the study concerns genetic variants associated with inflammatory processes in the brain. These may also contribute to structural changes in the retina. The study thus offers further support for the inflammation hypothesis of schizophrenia, i.e., the idea that inflammatory processes contribute to the development or progression of the disorder. ""If this hypothesis is confirmed, inflammation could be interrupted by medication, potentially enabling us to improve treatment possibilities in the future,"" says Rabe.

PCR genetic analysis has been in the spotlight since COVID-19, but light is now further facilitating PCR-free methods.

Osaka Metropolitan University scientists have developed a light-induced DNA detection technique, using heterogeneous probe particles, that enables ultra-sensitive and ultra-fast genetic analysis without the need for PCR amplification. This advancement is lighting the way for faster, more affordable, and precise genetic analysis across medicine, environmental science, and portable diagnostics.

As a means of analyzing changes in DNA, genetic testing - which is essential for diagnosing infectious diseases, detecting early-stage cancer, verifying food safety, and analyzing environmental DNA - has long relied on PCR (polymerase chain reaction) as the gold standard. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the term ""PCR"" has become part of our common vocabulary. But as those of us who have experienced them know, PCR tests are neither cheap nor fast; they typically require centralized labs, bulky equipment, and specially trained personnel.

""Our light-induced method detects DNA without the need for PCR,"" write Shuichi Toyouchi, a Project Lecturer, Prof. Shiho Tokonami, the Deputy Director, and Takuya Iida, the Director at Osaka Metropolitan University's Research Institute for Light-induced Acceleration System (RILACS), as the lead authors of this study.

Unlike PCR, which amplifies DNA sequences by making millions of copies of target DNA for detection, this method directly detects DNA by concentrating it and enhancing specificity through strong optical forces and photothermal effect.

The team developed a system using heterogeneous probe particles, including gold nanoparticles and polystyrene microparticles. These probes are short, known DNA sequences designed to hybridize, or bind, with complementary sequences in the target DNA. This process, known as DNA hybridization, allows the matching strands to bind together, making the pairing detectable through fluorescence.

The researchers then irradiated, with laser light, the solution containing the target DNA and probe particles. When the particle size matches the laser wavelength, a phenomenon called Mie scattering occurs, generating optical forces that move the particles and accelerate DNA hybridization. The gold nanoparticles absorb laser light, creating localized heat, or photothermal effect, to further enhance the hybridization specificity.

""Using just about five minutes of laser light irradiation, our method demonstrated great potential for accurate mutation detection with a sensitivity one order of magnitude higher than that of digital PCR.,"" Toyouchi, Tokonami, and Iida write.

By eliminating the need for PCR amplification, this method reduces costs, simplifies testing, and accelerates results, making genetic analysis more accessible in daily life applications - from healthcare and food safety to environmental conservation and personal health tracking.

""We aim to apply this PCR-free technology to high-sensitivity cancer diagnostics, quantum life science research, and even at-home or environmental DNA testing,"" Iida said.

The study was published in ACS Sensors.

A powerful clinical artificial intelligence tool developed by University at Buffalo biomedical informatics researchers has demonstrated remarkable accuracy on all three parts of the United States Medical Licensing Exam (Step exams), according to a paper published today (April 22) in JAMA Network Open.

Achieving higher scores on the USMLE than most physicians and all other AI tools so far, Semantic Clinical Artificial Intelligence (SCAI, pronounced ""Sky"") has the potential to become a critical partner for physicians, says lead author Peter L. Elkin, MD, chair of the Department of Biomedical Informatics in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB and a physician with UBMD Internal Medicine.

Elkin says SCAI is the most accurate clinical AI tool available to date, with the most advanced version scoring 95.2% on Step 3 of the USMLE, while a GPT4 Omni tool scored 90.5% on the same test.

As physicians, we are used to using computers as tools, but SCAI is different; it can add to your decision-making and thinking based on its own reasoning.""

Peter L. Elkin, MD, Chair of the Department of Biomedical Informatics, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB

The tool can respond to medical questions posed by clinicians or the public at https://halsted.compbio.buffalo.edu/chat/.

The researchers tested the model against the USMLE, required for licensing physicians nationwide, which assesses the physician's ability to apply knowledge, concepts and principles, and to demonstrate fundamental patient-centered skills. Any questions with a visual component were eliminated.

Elkin explains that most AI tools function by using statistics to find associations in online data that allow them to answer a question. ""We call these tools generative artificial intelligence,"" he says. ""Some have postulated that they are just plagiarizing what's on the internet because the answers they give you are what others have written."" However, these AI models are now becoming partners in care rather than simple tools for clinicians to utilize in their practice, he says.

""But SCAI answers more complex questions and performs more complex semantic reasoning,"" he says, ""We have created knowledge sources that can reason more the way people learn to reason while doing their training in medical school.""

The team started with a natural language processing software they had previously developed. They added vast amounts of authoritative clinical information gleaned from widely disparate sources ranging from recent medical literature and clinical guidelines to genomic data, drug information, discharge recommendations, patient safety data and more. Any data that might be biased, such as clinical notes, were not included.

SCAI contains 13 million medical facts, as well as all the possible interactions between those facts. The team used basic clinical facts known as semantic triples (subject-relation-object, such as ""Penicillin treats pneumococcal pneumonia"") to create semantic networks. The tool can then represent these semantic networks so that it is possible to draw logical inferences from them.

""We have taught large language models how to use semantic reasoning,"" says Elkin.

Other techniques that contributed to SCAI include knowledge graphs that are designed to find new links in medical data as well as previously ""hidden"" patterns, as well as retrieval-augmented generation, which allows the large language model to access and incorporate information from external knowledge databases before responding to a prompt. This reduces ""confabulation,"" the tendency for AI tools to always respond to a prompt even when it doesn't have enough information to go on.

Elkin adds that using formal semantics to inform the large language model provides important context necessary for SCAI to understand and respond more accurately to a particular question.

""SCAI is different from other large language models because it can have a conversation with you and as a human-computer partnership can add to your decision-making and thinking based on its own reasoning,"" Elkin says.

He concludes: ""By adding semantics to large language models, we are providing them with the ability to reason similarly to the way we do when practicing evidence-based medicine.""

Because it can access such vast amounts of data, SCAI also has the potential to improve patient safety, improve access to care and ""democratize specialty care,"" Elkin says, by making medical information on specialties and subspecialties accessible to primary care providers and even to patients.

While the power of SCAI is impressive, Elkin stresses its role will be to augment, not replace, physicians.

""Artificial intelligence isn't going to replace doctors,"" he says, ""but a doctor who uses AI may replace a doctor who does not.""

In addition to Elkin, UB co-authors from the Department of Biomedical Informatics are Guresh Mehta; Frank LeHouillier; Melissa Resnick, PhD; Crystal Tomlin, PhD; Skyler Resendez, PhD; and Jiaxing Liu. 

Sarah Mullin, PhD, of Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Jonathan R. Nebeker, MD, and Steven H. Brown, MD, both of the Department of Veterans Affairs, also are co-authors.

The work was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Researchers reveal that many children's mattresses release high levels of hazardous chemicals during sleep, raising fresh concerns about everyday exposure in early life.

 Study: Are Sleeping Children Exposed to Plasticizers, Flame Retardants, and UV-Filters from Their Mattresses? Image Credit: granata68 / Shutterstock.com

A recent study in Environmental Science & Technology measures semivolatile organic compound (SVOC) levels in children's sleeping microenvironment (SME).

Infants and children up to four years of age spend an average of 18 hours every day in their SME, which may consist of mattresses, pillows, toys, bedding materials, and the air surrounding their immediate sleeping area.

Previous studies have reported that SMEs often contain harmful chemicals, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs), and biological contaminants, including mites, bacteria, and fungi. Recently, SVOCs, such as stain repellents, plasticizers, and flame retardants, have been detected in many mattresses.

Since SVOC additives are not chemically attached to mattress materials, they have the potential to contaminate the surrounding air, clothing, dust, toys, and skin surfaces. This migration of SVOCs, which are high-fugacity materials, may occur due to their passive diffusion to a lower fugacity, thereby achieving chemical equilibrium.

Children's movements through shifting positions while sleeping or bouncing on a mattress also accelerate SVOC migration, which subsequently increases exposure to these harmful chemicals. In fact, previous studies have estimated that the SVOC inhalation rate among children is 10 times higher than that of adults.

In addition to inhalation and dermal exposure from sleeping on mattresses for prolonged periods, frequent hand-to-mouth and mouthing activities by children also increase their susceptibility to SVOC exposure.

Children's exposure to certain SVOCs, such as ortho-phthalates (PAEs) and certain organophosphate esters (OPEs), increases the risk of allergic diseases like asthma. These chemicals can also trigger adverse neurobehavioral outcomes, including effects on cognitive ability, prosocial behavior, and working memory.

Several countries, including Canada, have begun enforcing regulations to limit the use of some SVOCs, including benzyl butyl phthalate (BzBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), in mattresses and toys. Canada and the United States have also banned the use of foam-based products, including tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCiPP) and tris(chloropropyl) phosphate (TCPP), in mattresses intended for children three years of age and younger.

In the current study, a total of 16 new, low-cost, and varied certified children's mattresses (M1-M16) were purchased from major North American retailers. All mattresses were evaluated for the presence of selected SVOCs, with compliance to Canadian regulations.

M1-M16 were tested for carcinogenic flame retardants. PAEs, such as DBP, BzBP, and DEHP, were also measured to ensure that these mattresses adhered to safety limits set by U.S. regulations for children's products, including their mattresses.

A total of 45 analytes were tested, including OPEs, PAEs, BPs, and 5 SALs. All experiments were conducted at the University of Toronto.

Of the 45 test analytes, 21 were detected in 16 mattresses with detection frequencies (DFs) of 88% for tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) and 6.3% for TCEP, methyl salicylate (M-SAL), and tris (2-isopropyl phenyl) phosphate (T2IPPP).

No association was established between the total number of SVOCs detected in covers and foam and the mattress cost. Likewise, no relationship was observed between total SVOC concentrations and the type of polymer used in the cover, such as flexible polypropylene (PP), rigid polyvinyl chloride (PVC), or polyethylene (PE) copolymer.

The researchers did not find any association between SVOC concentration and the country in which the mattress components were manufactured.

SVOCs were consistently found in the mattresses' foam and cover, thus indicating that these materials may function as the primary source of contamination. While high levels of BPs, PAEs, and SALs were detected in the covers, all tested OPEs were found at higher concentrations in the foam, except for TBOEP.

Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis revealed that mattress covers and foams are rich sources of TCEP and TCPPs, which can potentially migrate into the cover materials. Several mattress covers contained DiBP and DiNP concentrations exceeding the permitted levels in Canada.

Both emissions and DFs were significantly higher in the presence of heat, weight, and a combination of both. Thus, children's body heat and weight increase SVOC emissions, and as a result, their exposure to these harmful chemicals increases.

The researchers estimated that children would be exposed to at least seven SVOCs detected in the mattress sampler and SME air samplers. In SME, the highest air concentrations were for BzBP, followed by DnBP.

Manufacturers should improve the oversight of their products so that they do not violate regulations, that they comply with their own product certificaitons, improve manufacturing practices so that unintended contamination is minized, and that such chemicals are not use when not needed.”

Mattresses are a significant source of SVOC exposure to young children in their SMEs, thus emphasizing the crucial need to update current regulations to restrict children's exposure to harmful chemicals. Nevertheless, additional studies using larger sample sizes are needed to validate these findings.

Telemedicine use in 2023 reduced monthly carbon dioxide emissions by the equivalent of up to 130,000 gas operated vehicles, suggesting it could have a positive effect on climate change, new UCLA-led research finds.

The findings, to be published April 22 in the peer-reviewed American Journal of Managed Care, suggest that telemedicine could have a modest but noticeable impact on the environment by decreasing the number of vehicles traveling to and from medical appointments. They could also have policy implications, said co-senior author Dr. John N. Mafi, associate professor-in-residence of medicine in the division of general internal medicine and health services research at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.

As Congress debates whether to extend or modify pandemic-era telehealth flexibilities, our results provide important evidence for policymakers to consider, namely that telemedicine has the potential to reduce the carbon footprint of US health care delivery.""

Dr. John N. Mafi, associate professor-in-residence of medicine, division of general internal medicine and health services research, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA

The U.S. health system now contributes about 9%, and transportation comprises about 29%, of greenhouse emissions in the country, the researchers write in the paper.

The researchers used de-identified data from the Milliman MedInsight Emerging Experience database to quantify nearly 1.5 million telemedicine visits, including about 66,000 in rural areas, during the April 1 through June 30, 2023 study period. They estimated that between 741,000 and 1.35 million of those were substitutes for in-person visits.

Extrapolating from these calculations, the researchers estimate that CO2 emissions were reduced by between 21.4 million and 47.6 million kg each month in the U.S. due to telemedicine use, which translates to the amount produced by 61,000 to 130,000 gas powered vehicles or recycling 1.8 million to 4 million trash bags.

""The health care sector contributes significantly to the global carbon footprint,"" said Dr. A. Mark Fendrick, professor of medicine and director of Center for Value-Based Insurance Design at the University of Michigan and the study's co-senior author. ""Our findings suggest that the environmental impact of medical care delivery can be reduced when lower-carbon options, such as telemedicine, are substituted for other services that produce more emissions.""

The researchers note some limitations to their findings. Their sampling method was based on data that was from a single, easy to access source rather than a random selection, so the findings may not represent the broader population or account for regional variations. Also, driving distances and vehicle market share were based on data sources from before 2023, though driving distances to in-person care were not likely to differ much from what they were prior to that year. Finally, telemedicine use has fallen since the end of the COVID pandemic, which may have led the researchers to overestimate the amount of emissions averted due to variations in telemedicine use rates.

Study co-authors also include Dr. Benjo Delarmente, Artem Romanov, Manying Cui, Chi-Hong Tseng, and Dr. Catherine Sarkisian of UCLA; Melody Craff, Dale Skinner, and Michael Hadfield of Milliman MedInsight, and Cheryl Damberg of RAND.

The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Aging.

Hip replacement surgery, or total hip arthroplasty (THA), can lessen pain and improve function in individuals with hip osteoarthritis, but some patients continue to experience long-term physical deficits-including muscle weakness, decreased functional mobility, and increased fall risk-after the procedure. New research published in the Journal of Orthopaedic Research reveals that a patient's muscle quality before THA may predict their risk of such suboptimal recovery after surgery.

In the study, 10 people undergoing THA underwent imaging tests before surgery. Patients whose imaging results indicated poor muscle quality were more likely to perform poorly on movement tasks after surgery, compared with those with good muscle quality. The severity of patients' osteoarthritis before surgery (as indicated by the imaging tests performed) was not linked to their functional abilities after surgery.

The findings from this study indicate that hip muscle quality may be an important predictor of post-operative biomechanical recovery following hip replacement. Muscle quality is often overlooked, and magnetic resonance imaging is needed to visualize muscle composition, which is not routinely collected for hip replacement patients. Future studies will seek to understand possible implications for poor hip muscle quality on long-term functional outcomes.""

The University of Queensland will play a key role in a national effort to revolutionize treatment for men with prostate cancer.

Radiopharmaceutical company AdvanCell has received $18 million from the Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) to develop and deliver targeted alpha therapies for prostate cancer, which is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men.

UQ's expertise in imaging and diagnostics will help AdvanCell progress a promising new class of treatment which delivers highly potent alpha radiation directly to cancer cells while minimising harm to healthy tissue.

AdvanCell Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Anna Karmann said our MRFF funded research will accelerate the development and translation of promising targeted alpha therapy combinations.

By partnering with outstanding researchers at UQ, and leading clinical investigators, we leverage novel tools and technologies combined with innovative clinical approaches to advance precision patient care and improve clinical outcomes for men with prostate cancer."" 

Dr. Anna Karmann, AdvanCell Chief Medical Officer

At UQ's Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN) researchers will contribute to key areas to inform how, when and where these new therapies are delivered to patients, and their impact on tissues in the body. 

Deputy Director Professor Kristofer Thurecht said AIBN's role was to help develop strategies that show how radiation affects cancer cells and design new diagnostic tools that reveal how a patient's immune system is responding to treatment.

""This will enable AdvanCell to identify suitable patients for clinical trials, monitor how well the therapy is working, and adjust treatment strategies in real time as needed,"" Professor Thurecht said.

""Ultimately, this will make targeted alpha therapy more precise and effective."" 

At UQ's Centre for Clinical Research, Dr Kevin Koo's lab is analysing patient samples in collaboration with AdvanCell to uncover why some prostate cancer patients respond better to treatment than others. 

""Every patient and tumour is different, which is why we're trying to understand why some respond exceptionally well to targeted alpha therapy,"" Dr Koo said.

""This knowledge will help clinicians personalise therapies and improve outcomes.""

Head of AdvanCell's Translational Medicine and Clinical Science, Professor Stephen Rose, said the funding was an important step for Australian innovation to improve the lives of men with prostate cancer. 

""This investment allows us to accelerate the translation of our Targeted Alpha Therapy - one of the most promising advances in cancer treatment. 

""Our multidisciplinary multi-institutional approach is key to defeating prostate cancer.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Single psychedelic dose boosts long-term cognitive flexibility in mice","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250422/Single-psychedelic-dose-boosts-long-term-cognitive-flexibility-in-mice.aspx","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 01:15:00 GMT","

University of Michigan researchers have found that certain psychedelic compounds improve the brain's ability to adapt and flexibly learn new concepts over long periods.

This kind of cognitive flexibility is impaired in many psychiatric and neurological conditions.

“Psychedelic compounds are being tested in ongoing clinical trials attempting to treat depression and PTSD,” said Omar Ahmed, U-M associate professor of psychology and senior author of the newly published study.

“These conditions, as well as Alzheimer's disease, are often accompanied by decreased cognitive flexibility. We find that a single psychedelic dose can boost flexible learning over several weeks in mice, highlighting the ability of these compounds to induce long-lasting and functionally important changes to the brain.”

The team discovered that one dose of the psychedelic compound 25CN-NBOH helped mice think more flexibly and do better in behavioral tests even weeks after drug administration.

This research, which appeared in the journal Psychedelics, highlights why clinical trials of psychedelic drugs may benefit people living with depression or PTSD.

Clinical trial designs for depression use only one or two doses. Our results show, in mouse models, that even a single dose of a psychedelic can result in lasting benefits. We studied flexible learning up to three weeks after the single dose and saw improvements. The benefits may last even longer.”

Elizabeth Brouns, U-M psychology master's student and study's first author

The present study utilized rodent models, but the results are likely to translate well to humans.

“The mice nervous system is an excellent model system to understand how psychedelic drugs function. Neurons in the prefrontal cortex of mice, as well as of humans, express serotonin 2a receptors, which are the primary target of psychedelic drugs. These serotonin 2a receptors are also considered to be responsible for the therapeutic benefits of psychedelic treatments,” according to study co-author Tyler Ekins, U-M postdoctoral fellow in psychology.

The tests involved injecting mice with either the psychedelic compound or a control placebo injection. The mice were introduced to an automated training device called the FED3, which gave them food pellets as rewards for poking their noses into distinct holes in the correct sequence.

After the mice became proficient at remembering this sequence over several days, the rules of the task were suddenly reversed, requiring the mice to learn to now visit the holes in the opposite sequence. Both male and female mice treated with the psychedelic learned this new rule more quickly than mice given control injections, even three weeks after the psychedelic was first administered.

This automated task design, developed by the team, marks an advance in how scientists study flexible learning over long durations. Designed to streamline the evaluation of cognitive adaptability, this innovation opens the door to more efficient and precise research into the effects of psychedelic compounds on the brain, requiring only infrequent human intervention, the researchers noted.

Despite the findings, Ahmed cautions that many questions remain. Psychedelic medicine is still in its infancy but progressing quickly, he said.

“A lot of fundamental, basic science and translational research is needed to ensure that clinical trials utilize optimal versions and doses of psychedelic drugs,” Ahmed said.

For example, the current study focused on the long-term effects of a single psychedelic dose. One key question is what happens with two, three or even 20 doses taken over several months. Is every additional dose increasingly beneficial for flexible learning, or is there a plateau effect or even a negative effect of too many doses? These are important questions to answer next in the quest to make psychedelic medicine more rational and mechanistic, he said.

Body appreciation differs between Middle-Eastern and Western societies, a new international study can reveal, highlighting how cultural and family influences shape body image and eating behaviors in young women.

Led by Flinders University and published in the journal Body Image, the study surveyed over 850 women aged 18–25 in Australia and Lebanon, examining the roles that mothers and sisters play in shaping body dissatisfaction, body appreciation, and eating patterns.

Lead author, registered psychologist and PhD candidate Melanie Deek, says the study found that while both groups of women shared similar levels of body dissatisfaction, Middle-Eastern women reported higher body appreciation compared to their Western counterparts.

Our findings challenge commonly held assumptions that negative body image is universally experienced in the same way.

Middle-Eastern women, in particular, showed stronger body appreciation, which may reflect cultural values and close family relationships that promote self-acceptance.

This suggests that family and cultural values in the Middle East may help foster a more positive view of one's body, which could serve as a potential protective factor for negative body-image and disordered eating behaviors.""

Melanie Deek, lead author, registered psychologist and PhD candidate from the College of Education, Psychology and Social Work

The study highlights the significant influence of family, particularly mothers, on both positive and negative body image outcomes.

""Mothers, more than sisters, were found to have a consistently stronger impact when it came to shaping eating behaviors and body image,"" Ms. Deek explains.

""Interestingly, while Middle-Eastern women reported more frequent 'fat talk'-discussions about weight and appearance-within families, these conversations were linked to positive outcomes, like increased body appreciation-suggesting a more nuanced cultural dynamic.""

The study also found differences in eating behaviors, with Middle-Eastern women more likely to engage in mindful eating practices, such as eating without distractions-habits associated with better mental and physical health.

""Their focus on mindful eating may contribute not only to healthier eating habits but also to a more positive body image,"" says Deek.

Senior researcher Professor Ivanka Prichard, a body image expert, says the findings challenge the assumption that body image concerns are largely Western.

""Western beauty ideals are spreading globally, but this study shows that cultural and familial factors still play a powerful role in shaping how young women see themselves,"" Professor Prichard says.

""To effectively address body dissatisfaction and disordered eating, we must develop culturally tailored interventions-not one-size-fits-all solutions.""

The research team plans to expand the study to include more Middle-Eastern regions, especially areas less influenced by Western beauty norms, and explore how these findings translate in multicultural societies like Australia.

""Our work underscores the need for inclusive, culturally sensitive approaches to promote positive body image and healthy eating behaviors across the globe,"" concludes Ms. Deek.

New research published in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology found that mothers who are anemic in early pregnancy face a higher likelihood of giving birth to a child with a heart defect.

The study assessed the health records of 2,776 women with a child diagnosed with congenital heart disease who were matched to 13,880 women whose children did not have this condition.

Investigators found that 4.4% of children with congenital heart disease and 2.8% of children with normal heart function had anemia. After adjusting for potential influencing factors, the odds of giving birth to a child with congenital heart disease was 47% higher among anemic mothers.

We already know that the risk of congenital heart disease can be raised by a variety of factors, but these results develop our understanding of anemia specifically and take it from lab studies to the clinic. Knowing that early maternal anemia is so damaging could be a gamechanger worldwide. Because iron deficiency is the root cause of many cases of anemia, widespread iron supplementation for women-both when trying for a baby and when pregnant-could help prevent congenital heart disease in many newborns before it has developed.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New recommendations for the treatment of familial Mediterranean fever","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250423/New-recommendations-for-the-treatment-of-familial-Mediterranean-fever.aspx","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 15:25:00 GMT","

In 2016, EULAR - The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology - published recommendations on the treatment of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). Since then, new evidence has become available, so the recommendations have been reviewed and updated.

FMF is an autoinflammatory disease caused by a single gene. It is characterised by repeated attacks of fever and inflammation, and causes pain in the joints, lungs, and abdomen - which can have negative effects if left untreated. Although it is the most common of the monogenic autoinflammatory diseases, it is still rare - resulting in low awareness around the disease for both patients and healthcare professionals, and limited knowledge about its management options.

The last recommendations for FMF were published in 2016, but since then there have been new treatments developed, and new evidence collected. To address this, EULAR and PReS - the Paediatric Rheumatology European Society - have worked together to review and update the recommendations. Researchers, healthcare professionals, and patients worked together to develop this new advice.

The new work, published in the April 2025 issue of the Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, includes 12 individual recommendations and four overarching principles. These principles emphasise that FMF has a complex clinical presentation, which requires expertise in both diagnosis and management. They also stress that the treatment goal is to achieve at least minimal activity and control of subclinical inflammation to prevent damage - and that this will require lifetime management and prophylaxis. Good adherence is therefore important for people with FMF, and patient-centred management is useful to support patients in achieving good health and well-being.

The 12 new recommendations focus on key management steps, from first-line treatment with colchicine and dosing considerations through to second-line options and the biologic therapies that may be considered. Specific recommendations also deal with issues such as amyloidosis, pregnancy, symptomatic treatment during attacks, and measures of disease activity.

EULAR and PReS are confident that this revised set of recommendations will support rheumatologists and other healthcare professionals in managing FMF in patients of all ages. They note that the updates highlight the need for a holistic approach and attention to compliance - but there is still much to find out about this disease, and ongoing research will help to support continued updates in the future.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Arena: Poch doesn't understand culture of USMNT","https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/44818825/usmnt-bruce-arena-mauricio-pochettino-usa-culture","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 16:55:00 GMT","

Luis Miguel Echegaray debates how Mauricio Pochettino will look to improve the USMNT ahead of the World Cup. (1:29)

Former United States men's national team coach Bruce Arena has criticized the appointment of current head coach Mauricio Pochettino, saying that a non-American lacks the necessary understanding of the country's culture.

Argentine coach Pochettino was appointed last August with the task of leading the USMNT into the 2026 World Cup, which will be jointly hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

He is far from the first non-American coach of the USMNT. German Jurgen Klinsmann led the team between 2011 and 2016 and Serbian Bora Milutinović took charge of the USMNT the previous time it hosted the World Cup, in 1994. Coaches from England, Poland and Greece, among others, have also led the team over the years.

But Arena, now coach of the San Jose Earthquakes in MLS, made it clear he is not a fan of the approach.

""You know if you look at every national team in the world, the coach is usually a domestic coach,"" Arena said on the ""Unfiltered Soccer"" podcast with former USMNT stalwarts Landon Donovan and Tim Howard.

""And I think when you have coaches that don't know our culture, our environment, our players, it's hard. I'm sure our coach is a very good coach, but coaching international football is different than club football, it's a completely different job.

""And I think when you're a national team coach, you need to know your environment, you need to know the animals you coach, and we're lacking that. If you're an American coaching the U.S. team, you know the culture, you know the pride and how important the national team is. I think when you bring in somebody from the outside, they don't understand it, especially in our country, because we're so different.""

The USMNT is coming off a disappointing two games in the Concacaf Nations League Finals last month, when it lost to Panama in the semifinals before falling to Canada in the third-place playoff.

Over the course of the international window, Pochettino openly questioned the team's mentality and character. He echoed those sentiments in an interview published Tuesday, saying talent alone would not be enough to earn a place on the roster for this summer's Gold Cup.

The focus remains on next summer, when the U.S. will be looking to at least match its best World Cup performance in modern times -- when Arena led it to the quarterfinals in 2002.

And Arena, whose short second spell in 2017 ended in failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, expressed concern over whether the USMNT would be ready to challenge the world's best.

""You ask me if we lacked pride, I'm watching and I'm shocked. I'm shocked that we can't beat Panama and Canada,"" he added. ""It was shocking to me.

""I don't want to be disrespectful. I want them to do great in the World Cup, there's no question about it. But we only have a year left now. Time is running out, and they got to get going.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Pochettino only wants 'right characters' at Gold Cup","https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com/story/sports/usmnt/2025/04/23/usmnt-coach-pochettino-wants-right-characters-gold-cup/83229780007/","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 16:07:51 GMT","

U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino has said he'll only select the ""right characters"" for his Gold Cup roster.

The pressure will be on the USMNT to bounce back after a dismal showing at the Concacaf Nations League last month. The U.S. lost 1-0 against Panama in the semifinal before falling 2-1 to Canada in the third-place game, failing to win the Nations League for the first time in four editions of the competition.

In the wake of the Nations League, the U.S. was criticized for a perceived lack of competitive spirit.

""If you aren't going to show up and actually give a s!%* about playing for your national team, decline the invite,"" USMNT legend Landon Donovan said after the Nations League. ""Talent is great, pride is better.""

As he prepares to name his Gold Cup roster, Pochettino has echoed Donovan by saying that talent alone won't be enough to earn a place on his squad.

""The right mindset must be there, because we need to compete for our flag, our country,"" Pochettino said in an interview with U.S. Soccer.

""What we are trying to do as a staff is to optimize every single area of preparation, and the mentality of the players is really important.

""We need to be intelligent in the way that we are going to select the players and not just choose based on talent alone. We need to have the right characters to be really competitive.""

Pochettino conceded that the USMNT didn't show the proper fight during the Nations League, emphasizing that it will take more than just technical quality to be successful at the Gold Cup.

""For sure to start we must compete hard,"" Pochettino said. ""We must match the intensity of our opponents, because in these tournaments they are always motivated to play against the USA. Of course we must perform well to win and you don't always get a result, but for sure in order to win you have to compete.

""It's not just about showing up in your home country and trying to play nice soccer. No, you must be proud, you must fight for the people that would love to be in your position, for the millions of kids that are going to see us and dream to be one day where we are.

""This is the type of responsibility and commitment we need to show in a different way than we did (in the Nations League) in Los Angeles.""

The USMNT was drawn in Group D at the Gold Cup, where it will face Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago and Saudi Arabia in the group stage.","{'href': 'https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com', 'title': 'Pro Soccer Wire'}","soccer"

FIFA Club World Cup

The Club World Cup will be broadcast on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom following a sublicensing deal with DAZN, the global rights holder for the tournament.

The free-to-air channel will show 23 of the newly-expanded tournament's 63 matches live: 15 group games, four last-16 matches, two quarter-final games, one semi-final and the final.

All 63 matches will be broadcast for free on the online platform of DAZN, who struck a deal worth $1billion (£750million) deal with FIFA in December for the global rights.

Premier League clubs Manchester City and Chelsea will be involved in the 32-team tournament, alongside Real Madrid, Inter, Juventus, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain.

World football's governing body had been in talks with Apple over a global streaming deal to broadcast the tournament, but those negotiations fell through in July 2024.

Channel 5 is owned by Paramount Global, whose president of international ad sales Lee Sears described the competition as “one of the sporting events of the summer” with matches played “in peak evening time” in the UK.

DAZN's CEO Shay Segev added “the Club World Cup will bring unparalleled engagement opportunities”.

The Club World Cup begins on June 14 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami and will run until July 13, with the final taking place at MetLife Stadium in New York.

Channel 5 was most widely known among football fans for showing UEFA Cup matches from the channel's inception in 1997 until 2012, when it lost the rights to free-to-air commercial rival ITV Sport.

Juventus director Cristiano Giuntoli insists that the Bianconeri hope to retain Igor Tudor for the 2025-26 season, but will make a final decision only after the Club World Cup.

The Old Lady visits Parma in a rescheduled Serie A Week 33 fixture.

You can follow the live action from the Stadio Tardini on the Football Italia Liveblog.

“The latest results have may have raised the Champions League quota, but we need to focus on ourselves and win this game to reach our target,” Giuntoli told DAZN via TMW.

The game was originally meant to be played on Monday,  but it was postponed after the death of Pope Francis.

Juventus returned to Turin on Monday and flew back to Parma this morning.

“We've been very cautious, giving intensity, but without exaggerating the volumes,” Giuntoli explained.

“Surely there was a bit of unease, like the others, but we must only think about putting in a strong performance to take all three points.”

Tudor is unbeaten in his first three Juventus games, and his contract expires in July, as Juventus will participate in the Club World Cup this summer.

“We've been clear from the beginning. The hope is to stay together, but it's a decision we'll take after the Club World Cup,” Giuntoli said.

A few players, including Randal Kolo Muani and Renato Veiga, are on loan until the end of the season, but Juventus hope to stick with them for the Club World Cup, which will be played from mid-June to mid-July.

“We are talking with their clubs, and we count on the players' will,” Giuntoli explained.

“These decisions will be taken at the end of the season. We are talking, and we hope to find a suitable solution.”","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Premier League sides Chelsea and Manchester City are two of 12 European teams involved in the event, with Real Madrid also present.

A £775m prize pot will be split between the 32 teams, with the tournament winners earning up to £97m.

The Club World Cup is set to be broadcast on free-to-air Channel 5 in the UK this summer after they reached an agreement with global rights holder DAZN.

The broadcaster will show 23 of the tournament's 63 matches live, including four last-16 ties, two quarter-finals, one semi-final and the final as well as 15 group games.

The matches will also be shown on DAZN, who will exclusively televise the other 40 fixtures after they agreed a £787million deal with FIFA for rights for the tournament.

Channel 5 has previously held the rights to the Europa League, showing it live from 1997 until 2012.

But the deal with DAZN for the Club World Cup, reported by The Guardian, is one of the highest profile sporting events it has acquired.

The new expanded 32-team competition features Manchester City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain, Inter Milan and Juventus.DAZN has said it will make every game available to watch for free worldwide on its app.

The Club World Cup is set to be broadcast on free-to-air Channel 5 in the UK this summer 

The British streaming platform struck a deal with FIFA, who had previously struggled to find a broadcaster, in December.

Just three months earlier president Gianni Infantino held an emergency meeting to try and drum up interest. 

DAZN's deal appears to be partly propped up by funding from Saudi Arabia.

Indeed, a minority stake was sold to SURJ Sports Investment, a company operating as part of the Saudi Public Investment Fund, in February. 

ITV reportedly made a cheeky £0 bid to broadcast the Club World Cup last summer - before the DAZN package.

The terrestrial TV giant looked to convince the governing body to give them the rights free of charge if it agreed to screen games during the new-look, expanded tournament on their main channels.

ITV initially entered the race, believing their offer to invest in production costs and screen games to a wider audience may have been enough to tempt FIFA. 

The tournament will run from mid-June until July 13 and games will be played across the US, including in Charlotte, Cincinnati and Los Angeles.

Chelsea and Manchester City will compete in it after winning the Champions League 

Clubs will able to earn up to £97m in prize money if they win all of their group-stage games and then the tournament itself. Chelsea and Manchester City will compete in it as a result of winning the Champions League in 2021 and 2023 respectively.

Clubs from other continents that have qualified include Boca Juniors, River Plate and Al-Hilal.  

The only team from CONCACAF, the north American division, will be Lionel Messi's Inter Miami, while Infantino called it the 'the most widely accessible club football tournament ever'.

The competition had originally received criticism from clubs and players for adding more games to a cramped calendar.

Global players's union Fifpro and the European Leagues body filed a complaint to the European Commission last year to protest FIFA's 'abuse of dominance' in the game.

According the tournament regulations published by FIFA, clubs must field their strongest teams for all games.

There is still over a month left of the La Liga season for Real Madrid, where they are still hopeful they can beat rivals Barcelona to the title. After the season concludes, players will not head to sunny destinations to relax; they will head to the United States to compete in the FIFA Club World Cup.

Los Blancos will participate in the 32-team tournament, with their first game on June 18. They face three opponents in the group stage, and if they progress into the knockout stages, they will play in July.

This is a problem for two Los Blancos players whose contracts expire at the end of June. Luka Modric and Lucas Vázquez are the players in question, and according to Diario AS, the club has extended their contract until the end of July, covering them until after the final if they make it that far.

It's excellent news for the two players, but they are uncertain whether they will be at the club for the 2025-26 season. 

Reports have suggested that Vázquez will not be offered a new deal, and the 33-year-old must look for a new club. The jury is still out on Modric, who performed well when called upon. Seen as a good squad member, he may be offered another year, something he is hopeful of getting.

In the same article, it was said that David Alaba and Fran Garcia, whose contracts expire in 2026, are potential departures in the summer. The former is the more likely to stay at the club until the end of his contract.

The topic of the bench for the white team still remains one of the most talked about in the press and social media. This is because it is not known if Ancelotti is the one who will continue on the bench until the end of the season or even in the Club World Cup. However, the most recent information suggests that this will not be the case and that there will be a substitute in the meantime.

Everything points to the fact that, unlike what some believe, someone completely new will not arrive but Santiago Solari. The former coach of the white team has already been notified to be the one to lead the Club World Cup in the United States in the summer. This, from the board's point of view, is the most natural situation they can see today at least for the moment.

That said, this may be subject to a radical change if the new coach wants to get involved very early. Only in this case would Solari's position be taken over by this new coach, but for now, it is the decision made by the board.

The Argentine already had the opportunity to lead the white team in a transition just before Zidane's second round. His performance was not the most optimal, but he left great things like the incorporation of Vinicius and Valverde into the first team.

Now he could be the main option to lead in the Club World Cup if Ancelotti ends up leaving as expected at the end of the Cup. A decision which for many is wrong, but today, without having a new coach signed, it is the most optimal.

For now, the only thing we can do is wait and see if the information about Ancelotti's departure after that Copa del Rey final really comes true. Only then will we be able to see what the board's move will be and if this is really the path to follow. However, before this, it seems very complicated to determine what the higher-ups are thinking.

There's a buzz in the air around Kansas City about FIFA World Cup 26, including at Westport Tattoo.

“To have something like that come to Kansas City, with being a big soccer fan all my life and all those world teams coming here, it's just great,"" said soccer fan Gabe Wilkerson. 

Wilkerson — who was getting work done on his right-arm sleeve Tuesday afternoon at Westport Tattoo, 1509 Westport Road in Kansas City, Missouri — wants to take his family to at least one of the six games GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium will host during next summer's World Cup.

Assuming, of course, he can afford it.

On Location, which is handling the premium hospitality tickets for World Cup games in Kansas City, recently released the price for its high-end offerings, which range from $1,225 to $3,000 per ticket for group-stage games.

But don't panic.

“Tickets for the FIFA World Cup 2026™ will be sold exclusively via FIFA.com/tickets, with general sales expected to begin in late 2025,” KC2026 CEO Pam Kramer said. “These tickets, which will be available to the general public, differ from the premium tickets currently being sold for FIFA's hospitality deposit program, On Location.”

They also should be cheaper — significantly cheaper — in most cases, but it still may take some familial financial planning.

“It definitely seems like a lot of those bigger sporting events are pretty expensive,” said Westport Tattoo owner Tim Johnson.

Johnson is also a soccer enthusiast and hopes his family gets to experience the World Cup in person next year.

“Whenever I heard it was coming, I wanted to go,” said Johnson, who said he and his family love attending live sporting events. “I told my son about it, and he wants to go as well.”

It seems like everyone wants to check out what all the fuss is about.

“I don't even care who's playing,” said Sarah Clark, a fellow soccer fan and tattoo artist at Westport Tattoo. “It would just be cool to go see the experience, get to meet people from all over the place and all that kind of stuff.”

As a kid, Clark played goalkeeper, and her family has always loved soccer. She remembers attending Wizards games at Arrowhead in front of sparse crowds.

“I would imagine we're gonna have a few more people involved and a few more excited fans than we did back in the '90s,” Clark said.

Wilkerson and Johnson said they'd be willing to spend $200 to $500 per ticket to attend a World Cup game. Clark said she's hoping to find tickets closer to the $150 to $200 range, so they aren't the target audience for On Location's packages.

“For the average Joe, I would imagine that's not within reach,” Clark said. “I, myself, would definitely not be able to afford that.”

Johnson said he's paid as much as $800 for floor seats to a UFC fight before, but he's worried about the dent four tickets in that price range might put in his budget.

“If it's a big event — like a life event, where you may not be able to do it again — $200 to $500-ish wouldn't be out of the range per ticket,” Johnson said.

Still, the price tag for the upper-end of ticketing options gave the crew at Westport Tattoo hope.

“That sounds pretty reasonable for some people,” Wilkerson said. “It's more than I would probably pay to do it, but that doesn't sound like it's outlandish at all.”

He feared it might cost $1,000 or more for any ticket to a World Cup game, but now he's hopeful general ticket sales — which will start in the third quarter of 2025, according to FIFA — should be closer to his family's price range.

Fans seeking priority access to World Cup ticket-included hospitality experiences can place a deposit with On Location.

The rest of us have to wait a few more months for a chance to snag a once-in-a-lifetime ticket.

“FIFA encourages any fan wishing to purchase tickets for the FIFA World Cup 2026™ to be wary of non-FIFA official ticketing websites that claim to be selling tickets already and only purchase tickets from the official and legitimate source once those are made available,” FIFA said in an email to KSHB 41 News via KC2026.

Fans can sign up for email updates at the FIFA ticketing website.

Chelsea and Manchester City have both won the Fifa Club World Cup

Channel 5 will show 23 Fifa Club World Cup matches this summer after agreeing a UK sublicensing deal with global rights holder DAZN.

The free-to-air broadcaster will show 15 group games, four last-16 ties, two quarter-finals, one semi-final and the final.

The remaining 40 matches at the expanded 32-team tournament, which takes place in the United States between 15 June and 13 July, will be also be shown free-to-air on DAZN's platforms.

DAZN had secured exclusive rights to broadcast the tournament in a deal said to be worth around 1bn euros (£829m) in December 2024.

Premier League sides Chelsea and Manchester City are two of 12 European teams involved in the event, with Real Madrid also present.

A £775m prize pot will be split between the 32 teams, with the tournament winners earning up to £97m.

An estimated 6.5 billion sets of international eyes will be on Atlanta in the summer of 2026, as viewers around the world don their team jerseys and watch the highly anticipated FIFA World Cup.

And with eight matches in Atlanta — including a coveted semifinal game — 300,000 more people are expected to flock to Georgia's capital to enjoy events at Mercedes-Benz Stadium and across the metro area.

The pressure is on for elected officials to show off the best version of the city without spotlighting issues that plague everyday residents, like Atlanta's traffic congestion or infrastructure problems. The tournament, with matches in both June and July next year, is arguably the biggest of many large-scale events the city has hosted in the past three decades.

“The idea here is that we reintroduce the world to Atlanta,” said Norelie Garcia, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens' chief executive officer overseeing the city's marketing of the event. “A lot of people's perception of Atlanta is from the 1996 Olympics, and so much has changed.”

Although there's still more than a year beforekickoff, elected officials have already started tackling crucial planning issues like how best to bolster public safety downtown, what transit options visitors have to get around the city and the best way for Atlanta's businesses to benefit from the huge influx of cash.

The Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce recently estimated that out-of-state visitors will bring in  about $500 million — but Dickens said Wednesday he hopes the number to be more than $1 billion, if the city can persuade visitors to stay a day or two longer.

“If they just spend an extra day or two in our region — they've got to have a hotel, they have to spend money on food — it doubles the money, almost,” he said. “All these visitors are going to fill hotels, not just in Atlanta, but in cities across the county, spreading the economic benefits throughout this whole region.”

“And I know that we will all be ready,” he added.

The first-term mayor running for reelection this year made his comments to a room full of elected officials from 15 cities across Fulton County, all of whom hope to benefit from the tournament as much as Georgia's capital city.

“This is more than just a game,” Union City Mayor Vince Williams said. “The World Cup represents global unity, resilience and the power of sport to bring together people of every background, belief and border. And I can think of no better region to host such a momentous event than ours — diverse, dynamic and deeply rooted in community.”

Atlanta is no stranger to courting and hosting major events. Last year, the presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden fell on the same day as the Copa America game between the U.S. and Panama — the events less than 3 miles away from each other. The city has also played host to Super Bowls, college football and basketball championship games, and more.

But Atlanta also faces a lengthy to-do list ahead of the World Cup matches: a $120 million downtown makeover that includes 25 miles of street resurfacing, restriping 200 intersections, installing 150 new streetlights and 14 miles of sidewalk repairs, including additional Americans with Disabilities Act accessibility improvements — all on a tight two-year timeline.

Officials are also expecting a majority of the city's iconic Beltline to be completed by summer 2026. Beltline officials said when the games come to town, nearly 16.3 miles of the main trail and 1.6 miles of the Westside Connector — which provides a pedestrian path from Washington Park directly to Mercedes-Benz Stadium — will be open to visitors.

Even Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport's new $530 million South parking deck, with about 7,700 spaces, is scheduled to open in time for World Cup matches. Airport officials recently announced a significant parking price hike to fund its major expansion projects.

And despite success in lowering crime across the city in the past four years, the massive event also brings its own security threats both inside and outside the stadium. The Dickens administration will lean on a newly created division within the Atlanta Police Department to prepare for potential disruptions.

“Everybody coming here won't have a ticket, but everybody's coming for the fun, the excitement, the energy,” Atlanta Chief Operating Officer LaChandra Burks sai. “What our public safety team often tells us, if we are not prepared for the people who are coming without a ticket, a lot of different things can happen.”

Atlanta has the second-highest number of FIFA World Cup matches in the country — behind only Dallas, which is slated to host nine games. Dan Corso, president of the Atlanta Sports Council, said the city tried to make the case to host the final, but Mercedes-Benz Stadium capacity didn't quite reach FIFA's 80,000-seat requirement.

“But that doesn't mean that the event is just downtown,” Corso said. “Everybody who has an opportunity to be a part of the World Cup — it may not be directly involved with the matches downtown — but your citizens and residents can be a part of your experience.”

The FIFA Club World Cup is an international men's association football competition organised by the sport's global governing body that pits the best teams from every continent against one another.

Having been held every year since 2005, the new format is to be held every four years, taking place in the summer the year the World Cup.

FIFA have rejigged the whole competition so instead of just seven participants and a straight knockout, where European and South American sides entered in the semi-finals, this format mirrors that of the World Cup.

32 teams will take part, with 12 of those being from Europe. Winners of the Champions League in the four years leading up to the Club World Cup all qualify, as do the other top ranked teams in UEFA's 4-year rankings. 

It's the same qualification format for teams across other continents too, with victory in the Copa Libertadores, Asian Champions League, African Champions League and CONCACAF Champions League clinching a place in the CWC.

There is one 'host' team that is selected for every Club World Cup, and in 2025 that is Inter Miami.

The 32 teams will be split into eight groups of four, and after a round robin, two sides from each group progress to the knockout stages.

The 2025 Club World Cup will be held in the USA, one of the host countries for the 2026 World Cup.

Games will take place across 12 stadiums in 11 cities featuring Philadelphia, Atlanta, Miami, Orlando and East Rutherford.

The tournament takes place from June 15th until July 13th, with the first game seeing 'host' team Inter Miami face Egyptian side Al Ahly in Miami.

The final takes place on July 13th at MetLife Stadium in New York, kicking off at 8pm BST.

The 2025 Club World Cup winners will take home a huge £97m from FIFA.

A prize pot of £774m is to be shared between the 32 sides. £406m of that will be shared according to sporting and commercial criteria, and the rest distributed based on sporting performance.



32 teams have qualified for the tournament, split by confederation:

However, at the time of writing only 31 teams have been confirmed after Mexican side Club Leon were removed from the Club World Cup after failing to meet criteria on multi-club ownership, with both they and CF Pachuca owned by the same corporation.

Their replacement is yet to be announced, though Leon were set to be in the same group as Chelsea, so the Blues will have to wait a little longer to see who their final opponent will be.

The aforementioned Chelsea qualified thanks to their Champions League win in 20/21, and they join reigning Club World Cup champions Manchester City as the only two English sides to participate.



Record winners of the Champions League, Real Madrid, are the early favourites to win the first revamped version of Club World Cup.

Reigning CWC champions Manchester City follow ahead of Bayern Munich, before a big drop to Chelsea, Inter, PSG and Atletico Madrid.

The first non-European side in the betting is Brazilian side Palmeiras, while the first non-European and non-South American side is Saudi Pro League's Al-Hilal.

Hosts Inter Miami, led by Lionel Messi, are 33/1.



The opening match will be staged in Munich on June 14 between Germany and Scotland.

US, Host Cities, FIFA Need to Commit to Protecting Youth

In two months, the FIFA Club World Cup, an international football tournament for club teams, will kick off in the United States, serving as a testing ground for the 2026 FIFA Men's World Cup next year. But FIFA has inexcusably not put a clear and comprehensive child safeguarding framework in place to protect children from harms at these two massive sporting events, which will attract millions of visitors.

Risks that children can face in the context of major sporting events include trafficking, sexual exploitation, child labor, and family displacements, among other forms of violence and abuse. Despite knowing these risks, FIFA has not published a Child Safeguarding policy for the 2026 World Cup: what will probably be the largest and most lucrative sporting event ever.

In 2018, FIFA awarded the US, Canada, and Mexico hosting rights to the 2026 World Cup, in part due to the new requirement for bidding countries to create a Human Rights Strategy. That strategy promised to “develop and implement child safeguarding protocols.” Such a policy should address dangers for kids, gaps in domestic laws, and coordination across sixteen cities in three countries.

Seven years on, these promises have been ignored: and the protection of children who will travel to, attend, watch, and live in the communities hosting does not appear to be a FIFA priority.

FIFA has watered down its promised human rights framework, and there is currently no comprehensive policy in place to protect youth.

A new report, “Keeping the Game Safe,” by the University of Miami School of Law Human Rights Clinic and the Centre for Sport and Human Rights, maps risks to children at mega-sporting events, with concrete recommendations for FIFA and 2026 hosts.

Event organizers should put in place mandatory safeguarding training, binding child protection standards, designate trained and experienced safeguarding officers at each venue and host city, and implement a centralized reporting system. Venues should have child-centered design and stringent protections against child labor.

It is critical for FIFA to establish a uniform child safeguarding policy, applicable to all host cities in the US, Mexico, and Canada. This should take into account socioeconomic and legal contexts, as well as needs of communities and children at risk. Survivor groups and other local and national experts should be engaged in the development of this policy.

The 2026 World Cup needs to raise the bar for children's rights, not lower it.

Arsenal's 'talent of the century' Gabriel Martinelli is finally back on track in bid to live up to his huge potential","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/psg-beware-arsenal-talent-of-century-gabriel-martinelli-back-on-track-huge-potential/bltc74b52ace8cfcd94","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 07:00:00 GMT","

The Brazilian winger has endured another largely frustrating season, but seems to have found form at the perfect time for the Gunners

""He's a talent of the century, he's an incredible striker. He's really unbelievable,"" Jurgen Klopp famously said after watching an 18-year-old Gabriel Martinelli score a brace for Arsenal against his Liverpool team in a 2019-20 Carabao Cup round of 16 tie. ""So young, looks so mature already, is a proper threat. I didn't want to put any backpack [pressure] on his back with this thing, but I just really like good football players and obviously he's a very good one.""

Despite his best intentions, though, Klopp's glowing remarks did indeed put a heavy ""backpack"" around Martinelli's shoulders. Expectations for the Brazilian were modest prior to that game, given Arsenal had paid just £8m to sign him that summer from Brazilian minnows Ituano, but an endorsement from one of the best managers in the business put him on the map.

Sure enough, Martinelli went on to establish himself as a regular starter at the Emirates Stadium, and was one of the Gunners' standout performers in 2022-23 as they came agonisingly close to clinching their first Premier League title in almost two decades. Very few defenders had any answer to Martinelli's explosive, unpredictable style of play, and it seemed inevitable that Klopp would be proven right at that stage.

But fast-forward to the present day, and it's fair to say Martinelli's progress has stalled. For a time, the 23-year-old seemed to have lost the fearless edge that made him so exciting to watch, and it has been reported that the Gunners could sanction his departure if they receive an attractive offer in the summer transfer window.

Martinelli, though, has not just suddenly been zapped of all his talent like Charles Barkley & Co when aliens invaded the NBA in the hit movie 'Space Jam'. Rather, the Arsenal man still has the capacity to be a match-winner, as he has reminded everyone - including Champions League semi-final opponents Paris Saint-Germain - with his performances at home and abroad in the last week.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

MADRID -- Italian teenager Federico Cina picked up his second ATP Masters 1000 victory by defeating Coleman Wong in straight sets at the Madrid Open on Wednesday.

The 18-year-old Cina won 7-6 (5), 6-1 to back up his victory over current No. 70 Francisco Comesaña in Miami last month, which marked his ATP 1000 debut. He saved both break points he faced against Wong and finished with 19 winners.

""I am very happy about this win,"" said the 373rd-ranked Cina, who is playing as a wild card. ""Before the match I was a little bit tight but after a few games I started to feel good. It is really special to win a match at this event.""

Cina will next face American Sebastian Korda. He lost his second-round match in Miami to Grigor Dimitrov.

Cina had lost in straight sets to Raphael Collignon of Belgium in his opening match in a challenger event in Monza, Italy, earlier this month.

Also Wednesday, Nuno Borges of Portugal rallied to defeat home-crowd favorite Pablo Carreno Busta 6-7 (7), 7-6 (3), 6-3.

Arthur Rinderknech defeated Roman Safiullin 7-6 (4), 6-1, while Christopher O'Connell got past Camilo Ugo Carabelli 6-3, 6-4.

In the women's first round at the clay-court tournament, Americans Katie Volynets, Alycia Parks and Bernarda Pera all advanced in straight sets.

Volynets defeated three-time Madrid Open champion Petra Kvitova 6-4, 6-0, while qualifier Pera got past Jana Fett 6-4, 6-3. Parks overcame Victoria Jimenez Kasintseva 6-3, 6-3.

The ATP Mutua Madrid Open is a historic Masters tournament played on the clay courts in Madrid, Spain. First-round action will begin on Day 1, and multiple Spanish players will be in action. As always, we at LWOT will offer predictions for every match on the slate. But who will advance?

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Camilo Ugo Carabelli has played at a high level this year, especially on clay and is sitting on his career high ranking of 59. This will be his first main draw appearance at the Madrid Masters, and he will hope to make a winning start. However, Madrid's courts don't play like usual clay courts due to the high altitude, which can affect Carabelli's rhythm. These courts should suit Christopher O'Connell's game style as he likes pace on the ball. The Australian player lost a close match to Luciano Darderi last week in Munich and will look to bounce back from that defeat. This should be a close contest, but I am going with O'Connell.

Prediction: O'Connell in 3

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Despite being played on his home soil, Pedro Martinez has never won a match at the Madrid Masters. His failures must have been influenced by the fact that the conditions here are different from those found in a typical clay court tournament. However, he would back himself to get his first win here against Francisco Comesana, who will play the main draw for the first time. Martinez will have the crowd support, and that should help him play his best tennis.

Prediction: Martinez in 3

Head-to-Head: Bautista Agut 2-1 Munar

Roberto Bautista Agut will make his 11th appearance in the main draw of the Madrid Masters, and the crowd will be cheering for him with all their heart. He is not at his best anymore, but should be motivated to perform in front of so much support. Statistically, clay has been the least successful surface for Bautista Agut and Jaume Munar, who played some great tennis this season, would be the favourite heading into this match. Munar's younger legs and aggression should give him the edge in rallies. In the battle of Spaniards, I am favouring the younger one to win.

Prediction: Munar in 3

An all-French first round clash, Moutet is a pedestrian 7-9 on the year, Mayot came through qualifying in some form but has failed to win an ATP level main draw match this season, Moutet has a bit more upside to his game, so he should be a slight favorite.

Prediction: Moutet in 3

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Aryna Sabalenka disagrees with what Carlos Alcaraz has recently said about Masters 1000 tournaments","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/aryna-sabalenka-disagrees-with-what-carlos-alcaraz-has-recently-said-about-masters-1000-tournaments/","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

Aryna Sabalenka and Carlos Alcaraz will both be hoping to get their hands on the Madrid Open title again.

Sabalenka lost to Jelena Ostapenko last week in the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix final, as she finished runner-up in Stuttgart for a fourth time.

The world number one was not the only player that finished just short of a title last week, with Alcaraz losing the Barcelona Open final to Holger Rune.

Alcaraz suffered an injury scare in Barcelona, leaving his participation at the 2025 Madrid Open is now in doubt.

Now Sabalenka has taken a different stance to Alcaraz on Masters 1000 tournaments like the Madrid Open.

Last week en route to Barcelona Open final, Alcaraz was asked about two Masters 1000 tournaments.

The week prior Alcaraz had won the Monte Carlo Masters, which took place over just one week, something that is becoming more of a rarity on both the ATP and WTA Tours.

When asked about the differing tournaments, Alcaraz claimed that the one week tournaments are much better for players, “The one week ones are better. Some will think that in two weeks there are days of rest, but that is not the case.

“You train, you have to mentally prepare for the game, prepare for it… you're not resting, really. It's two full weeks. That's why I prefer the one-week Masters 1000. For me, it's better for tennis.”

Suggesting that they may have different approaches to these events, Sabalenka has now given her verdict on these tournaments and revealed that she actually  prefers two week tournaments.

“I prefer two-week tournaments because having a day off between matches allows you to relax more, go out to dinner with your team, and explore the city,” Sabalenka said in her pre-Madrid Open press conference. 

“Maybe in a few years I won't be so interested in that and prefer to spend more time at home, but right now, that's my mentality.”

While Sabalenka is currently in favor of them, Alcaraz is not on his own in people who have criticised two week Masters 1000 tournaments.

Despite Alcaraz's plea, two week Masters 1000 tournaments are becoming more and more frequent.

Seven out of the nine ATP Masters 1000 tournaments will take place over 12 days in 2025, with the Canadian Open and the Cincinnati Open also being extended this year.

This leaves just the Monte Carlo Masters and the Paris Masters as the remaining one week events, while the WTA Tour just has the Dubai Tennis Championships, Qatar Open and the Wuhan Open.

The current Masters 1000 tournament is the Madrid Open, where both Alcaraz and Sabalenka are two-time champions.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","ATP Rankings: Points being dropped by Sinner, Alcaraz, Rublev, Auger-Aliassime at Madrid Open","https://www.tennis365.com/atp-tour/atp-rankings-points-jannik-sinner-carlos-alexander-zverev-carlos-alcaraz-novak-djokovic-andrey-rublev-dropping-madrid","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 07:48:49 GMT","

Defending champion Andrey Rublev is in danger of slipping down the ATP Rankings after the Madrid Open while Lorenzo Musetti is in line to make his top-10 debut.

Rublev lifted his second ATP Masters trophy last year when he defeated Felix Auger-Aliassime in the final, earning 1,000 ranking points in the process that helped him to solidify his position in the top 10.

But that 1,000 points will drop from his overall tally this week and he has dropped nine places to No 17, but, of course, he can still make up ground over the next fortnight with a run to the latter stages of the tournament.

The Madrid Open is a 96-player singles draw event and all 32 seeds receive byes into the second round, which means they earn 10 points without lifting a racket.

Winner: 1000 points
Finalist: 650 points
Semi-finalists: 400 points
Quarter-finalists: 200 points
Round of 16: 100 points
Round of 32: 50 points
First of 64: 10 points

So there is a bit of good news for Rublev as he is -990 ahead of his second-round match while Auger-Aliassime is -640, although the Canadian has dropped seven places in the Live Rankings to No 26.

World No 1 Jannik Sinner will, of course, not be in action at the Madrid Open as it is the last tournament he will miss due to his three-month suspension, but he will still drop 200 points after reaching the quarters last year.

The three-time Grand Slam winner will be back at the Italian Open in May.

Alexander Zverev is the top seed and it's an event where he can make up ground on Sinner and possibly put a gap between himself and third-placed Carlos Alcaraz.

The German is only defending 100 points from his third-round defeat in 2024 while Alcaraz, who was the two-time defending champion last year, lost in the quarter-final and will drop 200 points (190 when his 10 points for his bye are added).

Taylor Fritz lost in the last four against Rublev and so will drop 400 points, but remains at No 4 in the Live Rankings while Jiri Lehecka was the other semi-finalist and he has slipped 10 places to No 37.

Daniil Medvedev and Francisco Cerundolo joined Sinner and Alcaraz in exiting at the quarter-final stage so they will effectively be -190.

Novak Djokovic and Jack Draper are the biggest “winners” in the top 10 as they the former didn't compete last year so he won't drop any points while Draper is defending only 30 points.

Lorenzo Musetti is currently at a career-high No 11 in the official rankings, but he has climbed two places to No 9 in the Live Rankings as he lost in the second round last year.

Instead, points for his 19th best result will be deducted so he will drop 50 points before another 10 is added for his bye.

1. Jannik Sinner – 9,730 points
2. Alexander Zverev – 7,995
3. Carlos Alcaraz – 7,860
4. Taylor Fritz – 4,725
5. Novak Djokovic – 4,130
6. Jack Draper – 3,800
7. Alex de Minaur – 3,454
8. Holger Rune – 3,440 (+1)
9. Lorenzo Musetti – 3,160 (+2)
10. Tommy Paul – 3,120 (+2)
11. Daniil Medvedev – 3,100 (-1)
12. Ben Shelton – 2,980 (+1)
13. Arthur Fils – 2,920 (+1)
14. Casper Ruud – 2,725 (+1)
15. Grigor Dimitrov – 2,595 (+1)
16. Frances Tiafoe – 2,550 (+1)
17. Andrey Rublev – 2,540 (-9)
18. Stefanos Tsitsipas – 2,380
19. Tomas Machac – 2,215 (+1)
20. Ugo Humbert – 2,145 (+2)

The likes of Djokovic, Draper, De Minaur and newly-crowned Barcelona Open winner Holger Rune could receive nice ranking boosts if they enjoy runs to the latter stages at the Madrid Open.


                Novak Djokovic has sent a clear message to Carlos Alcaraz's critics.             


                ""On the tennis court, there wasn't that much difference between us, but in this I'm much better than them.""            


                Carlos Alcaraz may be forced to pull out of the Madrid Open, according to a report in Spain.            


                Rafael Nadal is ""sure"" Jannik Sinner is ""an innocent and moral person.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Tennis in Africa expands: Côte d'Ivoire welcomes ATP Challenger Tour","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/abidjan-challenger-2025-feature","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:07:49 GMT","

The city of Abidjan bustles with more than six million people. Energy can be felt through its streets and the city's size is impossible to ignore. Now that same vibrancy is intersecting with tennis as the Côte d'Ivoire becomes the 95th country to host an ATP Challenger Tour event.


Dubbed by some as the ‘Paris of West Africa', Abidjan is in the middle of hosting back-to-back weeks of Challenger 50 tournaments, concluding this Sunday. It marks another step forward for tennis in Africa, following Rwanda's debut last season and its second edition earlier this year. Brazzaville, Republic of Congo has also hosted this year and in 2024.


Now, the Ivorian locals are excited to welcome professional tennis to their homeland.


“The spectators are crazy around the court, very enthusiastic with the competition, so that's great. It doesn't look like a tennis match, more so football because tennis is not very popular in Côte d'Ivoire,” said tournament director Arzel Mevellec. “People like to attend something new, so that's good. We are the beginning of something.”




Abidjan, one of West Africa's key economic capitals, is located along the Gulf of Guinea on the Atlantic coast. It is also home to 22-year-old Eliakim Coulibaly, the country's brightest talent nearing the Top 300 of the PIF ATP Rankings, making Abidjan a logical location for the latest African Challenger destination.


The ATP Challenger Tour's expansion into the Côte d'Ivoire's former capital city is part of a larger effort to develop tennis across Africa. The Frenchman Mevellec is playing a key part, directing not only the Abidjan event, but also in Kigali, Rwanda and Brazzaville, as well as spearheading the Quimper Challenger in his home country.


“In France, tennis is popular. We have one million players. In Africa, they have one million players for the continent. That's a huge difference,” said Mevellec. “When you organise such tournaments, you need to especially think about the development for sure. In France, you cannot organise a tournament with no connections to clubs, for example. Here, you have to think about that.”


While Abidjan is taking a step forward as the next African city to host, it is part of the staircase leading to what could come next.


“The idea is to develop a tour in Africa, so that means we hope to have four or five weeks in a row on the west coast of the continent,” Mevellec said. “That is the aim of my action, to develop tennis in those parts of the world because it's not logical to have Africa outside the economy of tennis.”

Day four of the 2016 French Open at Roland Garros on May 25, 2016 in Paris, France.

The French Open is the only Grand Slam played on clay, making it the most distinctive major on the tennis calendar. It's also a surface that tends to lend itself to domination by a single player, given its unique demands. In other words, only a select few manage to crack the Da Vinci Code of Roland-Garros — and when they do, others can be locked out for a generation.

There is no better example of this trend than Rafa Nadal, who won a record 14 French Open titles. Of course, that domination has finally come to an end, with Father Time proving to be the one opponent the Spaniard couldn't beat on clay. It's undoubtedly the end of an era when you consider that, for the first time since 2005, the latest tennis betting odds for Roland-Garros won't feature Nadal.

Instead, it's Novak Djokovic who will fly the flag for the elder statesmen, with the Serb priced at 11/2 in the latest French Open betting markets. Despite being in the twilight of his career, you wouldn't put it past Djokovic — the most decorated player of the Open Era with 24 Grand Slam titles — to mount another deep run.

However, to the point at hand — and despite this generational brilliance, not to mention his claim as the greatest tennis player of all time — Djokovic has only three Roland-Garros titles to his name. Put another way, Nadal was able to enjoy a level of superiority on clay that even Djokovic, for all his mastery, couldn't match. 

The Spaniard would eventually retire, having played 116 matches at the French Open, winning 112 of them and losing just four: no one understood the quirks of clay better than Nadal. The King of Clay, indeed.

Merci @rolandgarros for this amazing experience. 12!! Still can't believe it pic.twitter.com/iNj8Me4iRJ

— Rafa Nadal (@RafaelNadal) June 9, 2019



The truth is that for many professionals, the slower ball speed, relentless spin, and the inability to bully opponents from the baseline with booming serves meant that Roland-Garros was more of a sightseeing trip to Paris than a realistic shot at a Grand Slam. For Nadal, it was always an opportunity to make history whenever he took to the court of Stade Roland-Garros.

Even with Nadal now retired, we're beginning to see a similar level of clay-court dominance emerge on the women's side as the same player, Iga ?wi?tek, has won four of the last five editions of the French Open — a striking parallel to what came before.

As touched on, once a player gets their eye in on the crumbling, devilish clay courts of Roland-Garros, they can rack up numbers that simply can't be matched at any other Grand Slam.

One of the many tributes paid to Nadal after his decision to retire was that his efforts at the French Open would never be matched again. That might be true — there are a combination of factors that go into winning a Grand Slam, and it's not just physical; the psychological battle is just as important.

However, it's also true that the French Open is a muscle-memory Grand Slam, and Nadal's numbers could possibly be surpassed in the next two decades.

By Gianni Taina

Born on June 8, 1997, in Riga, Latvia, Jelena Ostapenko's journey to tennis stardom began early. She turned professional in 2012 but truly announced herself in 2017 when she shocked the world by winning Roland Garros, defeating then-world No. 3 Simona Halep. 

That stunning victory marked her as one to watch, though her career since has been marked by both highs and lows. In 2025, however, Ostapenko has found her groove, delivering standout performances throughout the season.

Recently, she captured the WTA Stuttgart title with a commanding 6-4, 6-1 win over Aryna Sabalenka, boosting her WTA ranking significantly. Known for her fiery personality, Ostapenko has faced her share of controversies, including clashes with other players, such as a heated exchange with Elena Rybakina in Rome.

Just two days after her 20th birthday, Ostapenko secured her career-defining Roland Garros title. Her three-set victory over Simona Halep (3-6, 6-4, 6-3) remains a watershed moment. Reflecting on that time, Ostapenko admitted, “My life changed when I won in Paris. I needed time to adapt. It wasn't easy because I was 20. It's very difficult to get used to so much attention and pressure”.

After her 2017 triumph, injuries and inconsistency hampered Ostapenko's progress. She struggled to maintain her form and went title-less in 2018. But by 2019, she was back, claiming the Eastbourne title on grass—a testament to her resilience.

Ostapenko has never shied away from confrontation, earning a reputation as one of the WTA Tour's most polarizing figures. In 2024, she famously refused to shake hands with Victoria Azarenka after a match, with reports suggesting lingering tension between the two. 

In 2021, she clashed with Ajla Tomljanović, accusing her opponent of feigning an injury during a match. Her infamous outburst against Elena Rybakina in 2023, where she reportedly insulted her at the net, remains one of the circuit's most talked-about incidents.

Addressing her behavior, Ostapenko told to Clay: “When I play against someone I don't like, I really want to beat them. I don't enjoy making opponents angry; I just focus on myself. I'm emotional, and sometimes I say or do things I shouldn't”.

Ostapenko made headlines at the 2023 US Open when she demanded the removal of a disruptive fan during her third-round match against Bernarda Pera. Explaining her actions, she said, “He started yelling like crazy while I was serving. It wasn't just one or two words—it was several sentences. I told him to leave, and he did.”

Despite Iga Swiatek's dominance in recent years, the Polish star has yet to solve the Ostapenko puzzle. The Latvian boasts a perfect 6-0 record against Swiatek, with her latest victory coming in Stuttgart.

Ostapenko's Stuttgart performance was nothing short of extraordinary. She first took down Swiatek, the world No. 2, then cruised past Aleksandrova, and capped it off with a dominant win over Sabalenka, the top-ranked player, in the final. 

Her commanding 6-4, 6-1 victory not only earned her the title but also propelled her to No. 18 in the WTA rankings. With this run, Ostapenko achieved a feat not seen since Serena Williams—defeating the world's top two players en route to a WTA clay-court championship.

Following her win, Ostapenko said, “I didn't tell anyone, but I felt I was going to win this week. I'm playing better every day, and I believe I deserve results like this”. She now turns her attention to Madrid, Rome, and Roland Garros, where she hopes to reclaim the title she won in 2017.

With her Stuttgart win, Ostapenko reached another milestone. She became the first woman since Serena Williams to win at least one WTA title on all major surfaces—outdoor clay, indoor clay, outdoor hard, indoor hard, and grass. She joins Petra Kvitová as the only other player to achieve this feat in singles.

Image: Wimbledon AELTC on Facebook


The All England Lawn Tennis Club has revealed its ambition to undertake a programme of enhancements to one of sport's famous viewing experiences, The Hill at Wimbledon.

The AELTC said the improvement works are scheduled to commence following the conclusion of The Championships 2026 and the new-look Hill will be ready to welcome guests at The Championships 2027.

This project forms part of the All England Club's plans to mark the 150th anniversary of the first Championships in 1877.

The spiritual home for many a tennis fan, The Hill is one of the most coveted and atmospheric areas at The Championships with an unrivalled view of the No.1 Court large screen showing live action from around the Grounds.

The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club (AELTC), also known as the All England Club, based at Church Road, Wimbledon, London, England (UK) is a private members' club. It is best known as the venue for the Wimbledon Championships, the only Grand Slam tennis event still held on grass.

The Wimbledon Championships, commonly called Wimbledon, is a tennis tournament organized by the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club (AELTC) in collaboration with the Lawn Tennis Association annually in Wimbledon, London (UK).

The AELTC said the planned developments will allow far greater accessible viewing opportunities and will transform wheelchair access to The Hill's various tiers, including the Orchard and Pergola areas, situated at the top of The Hill.

The plans will also deliver more seating through a number of new low retaining walls which will optimise visibility of the No.1 Court large screen by reducing the gradient of the existing tiers.

These changes will allow for an expanded capacity with a 20% increase in guests enjoying use of the space. The environment in and around The Hill will be enhanced by removing existing paths and replacing them with permeable pathways, as well as introducing sun shading and rain cover via a new pergola.

There has been a focus on improving biodiversity including a stunning new floral display on the uppermost tier of The Hill and the use of flowers to replace existing permanent signage.

Deborah Jevans CBE, Chair of the All England Club, commented, “The redevelopment of our world-famous Hill, in time for The Championships 2027, will allow even more tennis fans to enjoy its unique atmosphere and vantage point. I am particularly pleased that these plans will increase the accessibility of The Hill for our guests using wheelchairs or who have additional accessibility requirements.

“It is an exciting opportunity as we look towards 2027 and the 150th anniversary of the first Championships.”

Ruth Hopkins, General Manager & Head of Access at Level Playing Field, added, “I am delighted that Level Playing Field has played an important role in working with the All England Club to enhance their world-famous Hill to be an inclusive and accessible space for everyone attending Wimbledon. These plans will deliver significant improvements for all guests but particularly for those with accessibility requirements.”

A planning application for the enhancements is due to be submitted to the London Borough of Merton.

Rafael Nadal enjoyed a legendary tennis career, winning 22 Grand Slam titles during his time on tour.

The Spaniard broke several records as a professional, perhaps the most impressive of which was his tally of 14 French Open titles.

Two years after his final Roland Garros triumph in 2022, Nadal retired from tennis when Spain were knocked out of the 2024 Davis Cup Finals.

Nadal's absence has been felt ever since, as fans of the 22-time Major champion miss seeing the star perform at the highest level.

One of Nadal's ATP Tour rivals has now revealed what he has found ‘strange' since the 38-year-old retired from tennis last November.

Speaking in an interview ahead of the 2025 Madrid Open, Roberto Bautista Agut shared his thoughts on Nadal.

“Rafa [Nadal] is missed a lot on the circuit,” he said.

“I think I've been lucky enough to enjoy it for many years, and well, the truth is that it's strange, when you've been living with some players for many, many years, and then they leave and you stay, it is not easy, it is different.

“Luckily, we have Carlos [Alcaraz] who has taken Rafa's place very well, and if we are lucky, we will enjoy him for many years [as well].”

Alcaraz and Nadal are two of three Spanish players to have won multiple men's Grand Slam titles during the Open Era.

Bautista Agut played five matches against his fellow countrymen, but failed to record a victory against Alcaraz or Nadal.

Bautista Agut lost to Nadal in the semi-finals of the 2014 Madrid Open on debut, 4-6, 3-6, his best-ever result in the Spanish capital.

Bautista Agut may never have beaten Nadal or Alcaraz, but that's not to say he hasn't scored some big wins over the years.

The world number 55 hadn't qualified for a Major quarterfinal before 2019, when he embarked on an impressive Grand Slam campaign.

Bautista Agut knocked out Andy Murray, John Millman, Karen Khachanov, and Marin Cilic on his way to the Australian Open quarterfinals in January.

There, he lost to Greek star Stefanos Tsitsipas in four sets, learning some valuable lessons ahead of his next deep Grand Slam run.

That run came at Wimbledon, where the Spaniard shocked the world by reaching the semi-finals at SW19.

Even Bautista Agut himself was surprised by his run in 2019, admitting after his quarterfinal win that he'd planned to be in Spain for his ‘stag do' during the second week of Wimbledon.

“I had planned to be in Ibiza right now,” he said.

“We had everything organised already. Well, it feels better to be here in London.”

Bautista Agut's Cinderella run came to an end in the semi-finals as he fell to defeat against eventual champion Novak Djokovic in four sets, 2-6, 6-4, 3-6, 2-6.

The 37-year-old hasn't returned to a Grand Slam quarterfinal since and lost in the first round of this year's Australian Open.

Bautista Agut will return to action at the Madrid Open, where he'll take on his fellow Spaniard Jaume Munar on Wednesday, April 23.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Carlos Alcaraz has become the prince of Wimbledon. Aged just 21, the Spaniard lifted the title two years in a row, beating Novak Djokovic in both finals. But even two-time champions aren't exempt from the All England Club's strict rules.

Players must compete in an all-white kit when playing on the club's hallowed courts. And Alcaraz learned that the hard way, when he was told off and warned that he wouldn't be allowed to play his next match if a banned colour was on show.

The current world No. 3 gave fans a unique insight into his 2024 season in his new Netflix docuseries My Way. It was a year of highs and lows - Alcaraz suffered heartbreak in the Olympic gold medal match and lost early at the US Open.

But he completed the Channel Slam by winning the French Open and Wimbledon back-to-back. Alcaraz let the Netflix cameras follow him during his title defence at SW19 last summer, and he revealed that he got into some trouble at the All England Club.

The four-time Grand Slam champion loves Wimbledon's history and tradition, though he has fallen foul of the stringent rules himself.

“I think Wimbledon is one of the most elegant tournaments in the world, if not the most elegant one, be it for its prestige or its rules. You can't step onto the court unless you're dressed in all white,” he said.

Remembering his own past experience, Alcaraz added: “I was wearing colour briefs and you could see them through my shorts, and they called me out on them, saying, ‘Next time, we won't let you play.'

“I mean, this really goes to show you just how strict they can be!”

The world No. 3 has since learned to play by the rules at Wimbledon and become a dominant force at the tournament. He beat seven-time champion Djokovic in a thrilling five-set final in 2023.

Then, a year later, Alcaraz dominated in a replay of the championship match, winning in straight sets.

“I started the final really strong, I was focused,” he recalled. “I knew exactly what to do. I did everything the same way, following the same pattern. Not once did I let him trip me up.”

Things got tricky when Alcaraz blew three championship points when serving for the title but he managed to get the job done in a tiebreak.

The Spaniard will return to SW19 this summer looking for a hat-trick of trophies. His last loss at Wimbledon came in 2022, when he reached the fourth round and was beaten by Jannik Sinner.

Tennis legend Andre Agassi will make his pro pickleball debut at the US Open Championships in Naples. The tournament is set to run from April 26-May 3 at East Naples Community Park.

Agassi, a former world No. 1-ranked tennis player and winner of the sport's Grand Slam, will partner with Anna Leigh Waters, the top-ranked women's player in singles, doubles and mixed doubles.

Here is more to know about Andre Agassi, one of the most iconic tennis players in the sport's history.

Agassi was born on April 29, 1970 in Las Vegas, which means he is 54 years old. His father Mike Agassi, an Iranian immigrant, was determined his son would be a successful tennis player.

When he was 13, Agassi started training at Nick Bollettieri's tennis academy in Bradenton. He made his professional debut as a 16-year-old in 1986 and won his first major in 1992 when he defeated Groan Ivanisevic at Wimbledon.

Agassi has been married to former women's tennis great Steffi Graf since 2001. The tennis power couple first met following Agassi's Wimbledon victory in 1992. They have two children: Jaden Gil Agassi, age 23, and Jaz Elle Agassi, 21.

Agassi was previously married to actress Brooke Shields from 1995 to 1997.

The 18-year-old Waters, Agassi's playing partner at the US Open Pickleball Championships in Naples, turned pro as a 12-year-old in 2019, becoming the youngest pickleball champion in the sport's history.

Waters, who lives in Boynton Beach, has since won 148 gold medals and earned an estimated $3 million per year from endorsements and sponsorships in 2024, according to Forbes, making her the highest-paid pickleball player in the world.","{'href': 'https://www.naplesnews.com', 'title': 'Naples Daily News'}","tennis"

Andre Agassi collected two of his eight Grand Slam tennis titles at the U.S. Open and now he'll be competing at a different racket event with that name.

Agassi, who retired from professional tennis in 2006 after playing his last match at Flushing Meadows, will line up alongside teenager Anna Leigh Waters in the mixed pro division at the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships next week in Naples, Florida.

Agassi, who turns 55 next week, has participated in made-for-TV pickleball exhibitions with other former tennis players and can be seen pitching pickleball equipment via social media. This will be his first professional pickleball appearance.

He won the U.S. Open tennis championship in 1994 and 1999, completed a career Grand Slam by winning at least one championship at each of that sport's majors and was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2011.

Pickleball is a mix of tennis and ping pong that uses paddles and a wiffleball. It quickly rose from nearly nothing to more than 13 million players in the United States in just a few years.

 Andre Agassi

Tennis legend Andre Agassi is returning to the US Open — but this time, it's not on a tennis court.
The eight-time Grand Slam champion, who captured two of his major titles at the US Open, is set to compete in the US Open Pickleball Championships next week in Naples, Florida. Agassi, now 54 and turning 55 next week, will team up with teenage sensation Anna Leigh Waters in the mixed pro division.
Though he officially retired from professional tennis in 2006 after his final appearance at Flushing Meadows, Agassi has remained active in the sports world. In recent years, he's taken part in celebrity pickleball exhibitions alongside fellow tennis icons and even promotes pickleball gear on social media. However, this marks his first appearance in a professional pickleball event.
Agassi won the US Open tennis title in 1994 and 1999, completing a career Grand Slam by winning each of the sport's four major tournaments. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2011.
In addition to his pickleball debut, Agassi was recently announced as a studio analyst for TNT Sports during the French Open semifinals and finals later this year.
Pickleball — a fast-growing hybrid of tennis and ping pong played with paddles and a perforated plastic ball — has exploded in popularity across the U.S., amassing over 13 million players in just a few years.
Agassi's entry into the pro pickleball circuit marks another major crossover moment for the sport, which continues to draw attention from athletes and fans alike.

Tennis legend Andre Agassi will make his pro pickleball debut next week at the US Open Championships in Naples.

The 54-year-old Agassi, a former world No. 1 in tennis and winner of the Grand Slam, will partner with Anna Leigh Waters, the top-ranked women's player in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. The 18-year-old Waters teamed with JW Johnson to win the mixed doubles title at the 2024 US Open and paired with her mother Leigh to take the female doubles crown.

Agassi and Waters will play their first match on Wednesday, April 30. CBS Sports Network will televise their first match at noon.

Agassi told CNBS it was Waters' idea to play together after she saw videos of him playing pickleball on YouTube. She did not have a mixed doubles partner for this year's U.S. Open.

""She's probably sick of winning so much, and that's why she called me and asked me to play,"" Agassi told CNBC.

Started in 2016, the US Open Pickleball Championships is expected to attract more than 50,000 spectators for this year's event. Pro players will compete for a record purse of $163,400.

More than 3,400 competitors of all ages and levels are scheduled to descend on East Naples Community Park for the tournament, which is set for April 26-May 3. Professional and amateur athletes alike, representing all 50 states and 40 different countries. will be playing on the park's 60-plus courts.

Novak Djokovic has asserted that he does not understand the criticism Carlos Alcaraz has faced this year as he pointed out what his young rival has already accomplished.

Alcaraz has faced some harsh scrutiny this season, particularly during a mixed run of results prior to the clay-court season.

The world No 3 has amassed a strong 24-5 (82.8%) record across the seven tournaments he has played so far in 2025.

The 21-year-old has won titles in Rotterdam and Monte Carlo and was a runner-up at the Barcelona Open.

Alcaraz was also a semi-finalist in Indian Wells and a quarter-finalist at both the Australian Open and the Qatar Open, while he lost his opening match at the Miami Open.

The Spanish star has won 18 titles, including four Grand Slams and six Masters 1000 events, in his outstanding career to date.

Ahead of the 2025 Madrid Open, Djokovic took issue with the criticism Alcaraz has received in his home country.

“No, I don't understand it,” the Serbian told Eurosport Spain. “But the atmosphere and tradition of tennis in this country is very high.

“The expectation is enormous after Nadal, [Carlos] Moya, [Juan Carlos] Ferrero… they've all been world No 1.

“But, listen. He's 21 years old, he's won four Grand Slams and many tournaments. What more do you want? You want more, but what he's done in this period is incredible.”

Djokovic holds a 5-3 record against Alcaraz in what is a fascinating inter-generational rivalry.

The Serbian won the pair's most recent encounter in four sets in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open in January.

The duo are both in the bottom half of the Madrid Masters draw and could face off in the semi-finals.

Alcaraz, the No 2 seed, will play either Zizou Bergs or Yoshihito Nishioka in his first match in Madrid. Djokovic, who is seeded fourth, will take on Matteo Arnaldi or Borna Coric.

In an interview with GQ earlier this year, Djokovic addressed Alcaraz's achievements and the ambitious statements he has made.

“Carlos has done something no one has done in history for such a young age. So the odds are with him. He is going to complete his [career] Slam very soon,” the 24-time major winner said.

“He's even said himself, he wants to make history. He wants to be ‘the best in history.' I respect that kind of mentality of, ‘Hey, I think I got the goods.' But maybe it's a little bit early for him to think about history.”

                ""On the tennis court, there wasn't that much difference between us, but in this I'm much better than them.""            


                Carlos Alcaraz may be forced to pull out of the Madrid Open, according to a report in Spain.

#NextGenATP Italian Federico Cina enjoyed a dream debut at the Mutua Madrid Open on Wednesday, when he overcame Coleman Wong 7-6(5), 6-1 to reach the second round.

The 18-year-old wild card earned victory on his ATP Masters 1000 debut in Miami last month and backed that up with an impressive performance against Wong in the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting.

""I am very happy about this win,"" Cina said. ""Before the match I was a little bit tight but after a few games I started to feel good. It is really special to win a match at this event.""

Cina saved both break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats and finished with a 19-17 winners-unforced errors count to advance after 81 minutes. The Italian, up four spots to ninth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, will next meet American Sebastian Korda.

Cina is coached by his father, Francesco Cina, a former professional tennis player himself.

A native of Palermo, Cina reached junior No. 4 in 2024 and this year is enjoying a professional breakthrough. The No. 373 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, whose idol is Novak Djokovic, reached his first Challenger final last month in Hersonissos before arriving in Miami and earning his maiden ATP Tour match win.



In other action, Argentine Mariano Navone defeated Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard 6-4, 6-4. The World No. 85 has found his best level on clay in the past, reaching finals in Rio de Janeiro and Bucharest last year. He will next play Ben Shelton.

Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech advanced to the second round in Madrid for the first time, rallying from a break down in the first set to defeat Roman Safiullin 7-6(4), 6-1. Rinderknech will next meet Casper Ruud. Benjamin Bonzi eliminated former Top 10 star Marin Cilic 6-3, 6-2, while Christopher O'Connell beat Camilo Ugo Carabelli 6-3, 6-4.

There was mixed fortunes for Spanish stars on Day 1. Roberto Bautista Agut moved past countryman Jaume Munar 6-4, 2-6, 6-3, but Pablo Carreno Busta and Pedro Martinez both lost. Carreno Busta fell to Nuno Borges 6-7(7), 7-6(3), 6-3 and Francisco Comesana defeated Martinez 6-4, 6-4. 

Laslo Djere downed Fabio Fognini 6-2, 6-3 to set a second-round meeting with Daniil Medvedev and Sebastian Ofner beat Hugo Gaston 6-4, 6-3. American Ethan Quinn will take on Miami champ Jakub Mensik in the second round after beating Dusan Lajovic 6-3, 6-4.

Lando Norris has openly shared his thoughts and feelings after a rollercoaster Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, admitting that he is applying “a bit too much pressure” on himself to be perfect weekend in, weekend out.

Norris arrived at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit with the championship lead and impressed through practice, but a Qualifying crash left him 10th on the grid while fellow title challengers Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri started at the front.

Although Norris managed to recover to fourth position, limiting the damage of the incident, it was not enough to stop team mate Piastri from moving to the top of the standings with three victories from the opening five races in 2025.

In a post-race appearance on the F1 Nation podcast, Norris set out the factors that he feels led up to his Saturday shunt, as well as how he bounced back from it.

“I was quite relaxed,” he said of his mindset in the build-up to the race. “I put in my headphones for the first time ever. I've never worn headphones on the grid. It's when I perform well, when I'm having fun and I'm relaxed.

“I'm probably putting a bit too much pressure on myself at the minute, not because of any [particular] reason, and not because of the championship and all these things. I just put too much pressure on myself because I want to do well, like I want to do so well.

“I want to be pole, I want to win, I want to be perfect, and I think I need to accept a little bit more that I'm not going to be perfect, and I'm making mistakes because I'm trying to be perfect, rather than the other way around.”

Race Highlights: 2025 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix

Norris went on to explain how he will tweak that approach moving forward – as well as underlining the belief he has in his abilities and championship chances.

“I think I just need to chill out a little bit and have a bit more trust in my speed, because my speed today, and my speed in every race this season, has been, I think, the best,” he continued.

""I do my best work in the dark,"" says Jenna Ortega's Wednesday Addams in the first look at the new season. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	It's both a Wednesday and a huge Wednesday news day. 


Netflix has released the first trailer (below) for its highly anticipated second season of the goth-horror-comedy hit, which stars Jenna Ortega as the morbidly inclined Wednesday Addams.




	The streamer has also announced the second season premiere dates, as the show will be released in two batches. The first part will be released Aug. 6 and the second will be released Sept. 3.


	In the trailer, Wednesday returns for a second year at Nevermore Academy, a private school for outcasts. Morticia Addams (Catherine Zeta-Jones) notes her daughter has never wanted to return to school before, and Wednesday deadpans back, “It's like returning to the scene of a crime — I already know where the bodies are buried.” Later in the trailer, she notes, “I do my best work in the dark.”

	The trailer also shows Wednesday reuniting with her spirited roommate Enid (Emma Myers) and shows glimpses of the rest of the Addams clan, including Luis Guzmán as Gomez Addams, Isaac Ordonez as Pugsley Addams and Fred Armisen as Uncle Fester. The trailer also introduces Steve Buscemi as the school's new principal, Barry Dort, and plenty of creepy dolls.


	The production has added series regulars Billie Piper (Scoop), Evie Templeton (Return to Silent Hill), Owen Painter (Tiny Beautiful Things) and Noah Taylor (Law & Order: Organized Crime). Also, there are many familiar names signed on for guest star roles: Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future), Joanna Lumley (Fool Me Once), Thandiwe Newton (Westworld), Frances O'Connor (The Missing), Haley Joel Osment (The Kominsky Method), Heather Matarazzo (The Princess Diaries) and Joonas Suotamo. Lloyd also played Uncle Fester in the 1991 Addams Family film.


	The second season was filmed in Ireland — a change from the first season, which was primarily shot in Romania.


	The first season of Wednesday — from creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar along with executive producer and director Tim Burton — was a smash for the streamer in 2022. Wednesday became the most-viewed English language series in the studio's history, with 252 million views, and spent 20 weeks in the streamer's global Top 10 (Squid Game remains Netflix's biggest hit internationally). The series also catapulted Ortega to a new level of stardom, which was further fueled by her role in Burton's Beetlejuice Beetlejuice last fall.

Here are the historical World War II roots that inspired one of the season premiere's key moments. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


This story discusses a meeting scene from the first episode of Andor season two.


	A key scene in the Andor season two premiere takes some real-life inspiration from World War II history.




	About 20 minutes into the first episode, there's a secret Imperial meeting led by Director Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelson) on a snowy mountain compound. There he plots the takeover and potential destruction of the peaceful textile-producing planet of planet Ghorman with a select group of high command officers. It's a scene that has major importance for the final scene of the Disney+ show, which leads up to the creation of the Death Star.

	“No notes, no records, none of you were here, nobody puts this in their calendar,” Krennic warns the group. “You're colleagues, superiors, if they're not in this room, they're not cleared for the project. The group in this room is the tightest of closed circles.”  


Andor creator Tony Gilroy tells The Hollywood Reporter that the scene is like when the Third Reich plotted its Final Solution at the Wannsee conference in 1942, where 15 members of the German high command secretly plotted the extermination of millions of Jews. “The very first scene that Krennic has where he talks about Ghorman, that's based on the Wannsee convention — the Nazi convention where the Nazis got together and planned the final solution over a business lunch.” 


	Visually, the meeting location doesn't look anything like the Berlin suburb palace where the Wannsee conference took place. Yet the snowy mountaintop location does look strikingly like the combination of two famous Third Reich landmarks: The Eagle's Nest, Hilter's famous hilltop retreat in the Bavarian Alps, where the high command made many key decisions (and was memorably depicted in HBO's Band of Brothers). The location also resembles Austria's Hohenwerfen Castle, which was another Nazi-run snowy hilltop outpost during the war.  


	Here's the Imperial outpost at The Maltheen Divide in the Andor premiere:


	Here's the Eagle's Nest:


	And here's Hohenwerfen Castle: 


	The Galactic Empire in Star Wars was (rather not so subtly) heavily inspired by Nazi Germany and other fascist dictatorships. The Nazis also had “stormtroopers” (Sturmabteilung), Darth Vader's helmet has echos of helmets worn by Wehrmacht officers, Hitler went from Germany's chancellor to dictator (not unlike Palpatine going from chancellor to Emperor), and George Lucas originally used World War II dogfight footage for the basis of A New Hope‘s space fight scenes.

	











Andor is Disney+'s acclaimed Star Wars drama series, which follows the adventures of Rebel Alliance leader Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and leads up to the events in the film Rogue One. The 12-episode second season will be released in three episode blocks over the next four weeks.

""He is doing well and is looking forward to coming back to San Antonio soon as well as continuing his US Tour,"" Santana's manager said Tuesday. 


							By 

	Ethan Millman


Music Editor


Carlos Santana postponed a concert in San Antonio Tuesday night after the legendary guitarist was hospitalized for dehydration, a rep for Santana confirmed Tuesday. 


	Santana was slated to play San Antonio's Majestic Theatre this evening, but his manager, Michael Vrionis, said he was taken in for observation after suffering an incident while prepping for the show, and doctors determined Santana was suffering from dehydration.




	“Out of an abundance of caution and the health of Mr. Santana, the decision to postpone the show was the most prudent course of action,” Vrionis said. “He is doing well and is looking forward to coming back to San Antonio soon as well as continuing his US Tour. Thank you all very much for your understanding. The show will be rescheduled soon.”

	Santana's reps are advising ticket holders to hang onto their tickets, stating they'd have more information on the rescheduled date as soon as possible. Other than Tuesday's show, Santana also has shows slated this week for Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. Santana's team didn't specify whether the incident would impact any of those upcoming shows as well.


	The cancellation comes less than a week after Santana started the Oneness Tour 2025 at Yaamava' Theater in Highland, California, on April 16. He played two more shows as well at the Talking Stick Resort Amphitheatre in Phoenix on April 18, and at the Isleta Amphitheater in Albuquerque on April 19.


	This isn't the first time Santana has postponed shows over dehydration. He collapsed on stage back in 2022, subsequently canceling six concerts, as Vrionis said Santana was recovering from heat exhaustion.

The pop queen and 'Girls' scribe are co-writing the score and book, respectively, for the adaptation of the beloved teen movie.

	Rebecca Milzoff



	When romantic comedy 10 Things I Hate About You was released in 1999 — a seminal time for the Shakespeare adaptation-as-teen-movie — it was a watershed pop cultural moment. The winning take on The Taming of the Shrew cemented the star power of actors Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and boasted a spunky soundtrack of late-'90s acts like Letters to Cleo, Semisonic and The Cardigans (plus, of course, The Four Seasons; who could forget Ledger's iconic rendition of “Can't Take My Eyes Off You”?).

	Nearly thirty years later, Broadway audiences will see if that magic can be recaptured onstage. Billboard exclusively reveals that 10 Things is being adapted as a musical — with two major creatives keenly attuned to the nuances of young romance onboard. Billboard Hot 100-topping singer-songwriter Carly Jepsen will co-write the score with singer, writer and producer Ethan Gruska (with whom she's collaborated on songs from her latest album, The Loveliest Time, and who's also worked with artists like Bon Iver and Phoebe Bridgers), and Lena Dunham will co-write the book with award-winning playwright Jessica Huang.




			Trending on Billboard		







	For Jepsen's fans — who may have noticed her frequent presence in New York, and at the theater, on social media in recent months — this news answers long-circulating rumors that she was involved in some percolating Broadway project. This isn't her first big turn in the musical theater realm — she took over the title role in the Broadway production of Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella in 2014 and played Frenchy in Fox's Emmy-winning Grease: Live —  but 10 Things does mark her debut behind-the-scenes, giving her a chance to show off her deeply emotional pop writing and talent for storytelling through song.  Multihyphenate Dunham, whose much-anticipated romcom series Too Much comes to Netflix this year, is also making her debut on a Broadway creative team. 


	Their collaborators, Gruska and Huang, round out a creative team stacked with acclaimed Broadway veterans. 10 Things will be directed and choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon, the former New York City Ballet resident choreographer who rose to the top of the dance world and has since become a formidable theater force, directing and choreographing An American in Paris and MJ: The Musical on Broadway (both Tony-winners). Music supervisor, arranger and orchestrator Tom Kitt is a two-time Tony, two-time Emmy, two-time Grammy and Pulitzer Prize winner known best for writing the hit musical Next to Normal. And producer Mike Bosner has a track record with boundary-pushing, Tony-winning Broadway hits, most recently producing Shucked and making his name as lead producer of Beautiful — The Carole King Musical. (Bosner is producing the musical through a special arrangement with Buena Vista Theatrical.)

	The second is via Instagram by visiting the AMAs' profile, where fans can find a pinned “VOTE HERE” post. Under the post, comment your vote by using one of the promoted hashtags, which can be found on the show's website. Each artist in every category has a unique hashtag for each award they're up for — meaning artists up for multiple prizes will have different voting tags for each.

	Also, take note: You can only include one hashtag per comment, so make sure to leave individual comments for each artist/award you're voting for. Your Instagram account must also be public in order for your vote to be counted!


	Fans can cast up to 25 votes in each awards category per voting method every day up until the awards. The exceptions to that rule come on “Turbo Days” — April 29, May 6 and May 13 — on which you can vote double that amount.


	Instagram voting closes Thursday, May 15, at 11:59 p.m. PT.

Sharon Osbourne has shared her disdain of Northern Irish hip-hop trio Kneecap and the outspoken messaging present in their recent Coachella set, going so far as to call for the revocation of their work visas.

	Osbourne shared her comments on social media on Tuesday (April 22), days after Kneecap played the second weekend of the Coachella festival. The Friday (April 18) performance drew recognition for the band's use of strong anti-Israel sentiments during their set – sentiments which they had claimed were censored during their first weekend appearance.

	“Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,” the projected messages read. “It is being enabled by the U.S. government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes. F–k Israel; free Palestine.” 




			Trending on Billboard		







	These messages weren't the only pro-Palestinian sentiments shared during the 2025 edition of the festival. Notably, Green Day altered lyrics to reflect the plight of Palestinian children, while names such as Bob Vylan and Blonde Redhead displayed Palestinian flags during their sets. In the case of the latter, the onstage event was soundtracked by audio of Mahmoud Khalil – the detained Columbia University graduate student currently being held in an immigration detention center following his role in on-campus protests.


	However, Osbourne shared a lengthy response to the apparent politicisation of Coachella, noting that this year's edition will be remembered “as a festival that compromised its moral and spiritual integrity.”


	“Goldenvoice, the festival organizer, facilitated this by allowing artists to use the Coachella stage as a platform for political expression,” she wrote. “At a time when the world is experiencing significant unrest, music should serve as an escape, not a stage for political discourse. 


	“While festivals like Coachella showcase remarkable talent from around the globe, music's primary purpose is to unite people. It should not be a venue for promoting terrorist organizations or spreading hate.”


	As Osbourne continued, she noted that despite being a fan of Saturday headliners Green Day, she felt that their own views of events in the Middle East would have been more appropriate if shared “at their own concert, not at a festival.” Kneecap's sentiments, however, were deemed so egregious that she closed by asking supporters to join in her “advocating for the revocation of Kneecap's work visa.”

	











	“Kneecap, an Irish rap group, took their performance to a different level by incorporating aggressive political statements,” Osbourne wrote. “Their actions included projections of anti-Israel messages and hate speech, and this band openly support terrorist organizations. 


	“This behavior raises concerns about the appropriateness of their participation in such a festival and further shows they are booked to play in the USA. Reports indicate that Goldenvoice was unaware of Kneecap's political intentions when they were booked. However, after witnessing their performance during the first weekend, allowing them to perform again the following weekend suggests support of their rhetoric and a lack of due diligence.”


	In the wake of Kneecap's performance, Goldenvoice CEO Paul Tollett reportedly claimed he was “blindsided” by the band's actions. While HYBE America CEO and former talent manager Scooter Braun – who previously staged exhibits in Los Angeles and Israel about the October 7, 2023 attacks in Israel – defended Tollett, Osbourne expressed disbelief that anyone who attended exhibits such as Braun's could book an artist such as Kneecap for the festival.


	“Furthermore, the Independent Artists Group, which represents Kneecap, includes individuals of Jewish heritage,” she continued. “It is disheartening that they have not used their positions to prevent the promotion of such controversial messages. Shame on them. 


	“As someone with both Irish Catholic on my Mothers side and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage on my Fathers side, and extensive experience in the music industry, I understand the complexities involved,” she added. “Goldenvoice's claim of being ‘blindsided' by Kneecap's performance seems implausible given the circumstances. I know for a fact that certain people in the industry had written to Goldenvoice, airing their concerns around the booking of Kneecap.”

	











	For their part, Kneecap have not responded directly to the criticism of their messaging, instead sharing examples of the myriad supportive messages they have received in the wake of their Coachella sets. The group will return to North America in October for another run of live dates.

In her centennial year, the Cuban singer will be honored with the Legend Award at Billboard's Latin Women in Music gala on April 24.

	Leila Cobo


Chief Content Officer Latin/Español, Billboard


	Born one hundred years ago in Havana, Cuba, on October 21, 1925, Celia Cruz sang almost before she could talk. The second oldest of 14 children, she could carry a tune at 10 months old, according to her mother, and as a toddler, sang her youngest siblings to sleep. Those bedside moments were the first stage for the woman who would become the single best-known and most influential female figure in the history of Afro Cuban music.  


	By the time she died in 2003 at age 77, Cruz had over 70 albums to her name and had transfixed generations of fans with her mesmerizing stage presence and a signature, rich, expressive contralto that could turn a single word into a masterpiece of a song.  

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Cruz was recognized worldwide as much for her extravagant flamboyant outfits, tireless work ethic and colorful wigs as for her trademark cry of “Azúcar!.” But Cruz possessed, above everything, an extraordinary voice. 


	“Forget about getting her behind a mic,” Marc Anthony once told Billboard. “She'll turn anybody out.”


	Indeed, Cruz adamantly refused to lip-sync, even on live TV shows. “I can't go out there and pretend,” she told Billboard in 2000. “In Cuba, I worked with a man named Rodrigo Neira, who was the choreographer of the Tropicana. He wanted a singer to sing and a dancer to dance.”


	Although Cruz's dancing abilities weren't negligible, her voice was incomparable.


	Cruz's recorded legacy is a veritable history of Latin music, from her days with Cuba's legendary La Sonora Matancera to her highly experimental and avant garde later fare, which even mixed urban music with her salsa beats.


	Cruz charted until the day she died, and beyond. More than 20 years after her death, she generated 64 million on-demand official streams in the United States in 2024, according to Luminate. Last year, the U.S. Mint released a commemorative Cruz quarter, the only coin that bears the stamp of a Latin artist. The item joins a list of Cruz memorabilia that includes a stamp, a doll, multiple exhibits, merchandise lines and both a TV series and film in the works, among other projects.


	As a child, Cruz began singing in amateur contests. Her big break came in 1950, when she was called in to replace the lead singer of the legendary La Sonora Matancera, arguably the best salsa band of all time. Cruz gained international acclaim with La Sonora, with whom she remained for 15 years, eventually marrying lead trumpet player Pedro Knight.

	











	Following the Cuban revolution, she settled in New York in 1962 and was never allowed to return to her home country. Cruz's career also flourished stateside, first through her association with Tito Puente's Ticco Records and later with Fania Records.


	Although Cruz remained a popular and venerated figure — she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1987 — she gained a new legion of followers in 2000 after signing with Sony Music Latin, a label that gave her a star treatment until the day she died. With Sony Latin, Cruz won three consecutive Latin Grammy Awards in 2000, 2001 and 2002.


	The secret to her perennial success, she told Billboard, was very basic: “First of all, I take good care of myself. I rest. Second, I plan my shows well. I always try to shape my repertoire around a particular audience. And finally, I'm always changing my outfits, my look onstage.” But at the core of it was her tireless work ethic, and that voice.


	After being diagnosed with cancer in 2002, Cruz made a final trip to the recording studio in February 2003. She recorded for two months and died in July.


	This year, Billboard's Latin Women in Music honors Cruz and her extraordinary life not on the anniversary of her death but in the centennial year of her birth. Cruz will posthumously receive the Legend Award at the gala, which will air April 24 at 9 p.m. ET on Telemundo, and be honored with a musical tribute with performances by Ivy Queen, La India and Olga Tañon.


Billboard spoke to four people who had personal ties to Cruz. Here are their recollections, in their own words.


	Celia was someone who was able to bring our music to this country at a time when women weren't really welcomed in the music industry.

	











	When she joined forces with Fania and Johnny Pacheco, she showed the world what true talent was. And she never changed her musical essence or who she was. She was such an example of humility, perseverance, talent — my God. She became family to us. I was just starting out as a producer, and my dream was always to work with her. But I didn't offer because we were just getting started. We had met, but we hadn't really talked much yet.


	One night, we were playing at the Dupont Plaza, and she asked us to sit at her table. It was like talking to a queen. I remember one time we were performing at the Ovni, and we always played “Quimbara.” She was in the audience, and she came onstage to sing. Our hearts almost burst out of our chests.


	I had the honor of producing several albums for her. One day she called me and said, “I don't have a record label anymore.” And I told her, “I'm going to send you to Sony.” Thank God I called Tommy [Mottola, who] said, “Don't even worry about it. We've got to sign her.” She went into Sony with so much respect. They were going to give her the boost she needed. She passed away with six No. 1 hits. At the time, there was resistance because most of the artists selling records were men. She was one of the women who proved to the world that women could make everyone dance. She was such an inspiration for Gloria [Estefan]. I think we can all learn something from her.


	She and Pedro [Knight] were such humble, kind people who taught us so much. When we were recording, she was so professional. She could almost sing live; she practiced her parts, showed up with humility and was always so proud of her Cuban roots. And the love between her and Pedro… It's rare to work with a couple and see them love each other so much for so many years, being such simple, good people with so much talent.

	











	She was my great teacher. She always remembered to send birthday cards to everyone. Those little thoughtful gestures. She was like a sister to Gloria. She'd come over to eat at our house and was so funny. She'd wash Pedro's shirts and iron them when they were on tour. I'll never forget when I produced the Latin Grammys [for CBS on 2000] — she had terrible knee pain but got up to sing “Quimbara” with Ricky [Martin] anyway. No one could tell what she was going through.


	One day she came to us and said, “I got the big C.” I had no idea what she meant. She called me to help arrange her burial. She told me, “I want every fan I have to be able to say goodbye to me.” She wasn't just loved by Cubans — she was loved by the whole world. She left me one of her dresses, shoes and wig as a thank you, along with a beautiful note for me and Gloria. In a way, I feel at peace knowing I was able to help a woman like her, that I could get her signed to Sony. In these times we're living in, when one person shines, we all shine. And she made all of us shine.


	I met Celia in 1988 through important people in her life. Her nephew was a big fan of mine and he would go see me at the Palladium. He told me he was Celia Cruz's nephew and we didn't believe him. Celia was already a legend. We listened to her music and all the Afro Yoruba-ness around her was really interesting. And of course we all loved La Sonora Matancera.


	One day, she sent a message through him, saying, “Muchas benidiciones en tu show.” (“Many blessings on your show.”) Then in 1990, a year before I decided to cross over from dance to salsa tropical, I was already collaborating with Tito Puente and Tito arranged for us to meet.

	











	We all went to dinner. When I met her, it felt as if we were already family. We spoke about her music, about her. She said she always felt she had a natural ability to sing music with a lot of rhythm. She said, “One thing I notice about you is you study a lot of jazz, but you have a lot of soul. I'd like you to cross over from dance music and do a salsa album.” We sang with prerecorded TV tracks then, and she said, “You need to be up there singing with a live band.”


	She set up a meeting with Ralph Mercado [founder and president of RMM Records, to which Cruz was signed at the time] and said, “Hey, I want you to sign her.”


	We were very close. We talked a lot about music, about the hard labor of a woman. We talked about believing in ourselves, being professional and giving 100% to the music. I found it to be very empowering.


	She used to say, “Yo soy tu madrina musical [“I'm your music godmother],” and she wanted to officially be my godmother. I hadn't had my first communion, and I needed to be baptized.


	She baptized me on Feb. 14, which is the day of friendship and love, and it brought a lot of light into my life, which I needed. I came from a very dysfunctional family, but a very praying family. God was always in our lives. I think that's why it meant so much to me to be baptized with Celia and [husband] Pedro Knight [by my side], and because it meant she would always be in my life. And she was. She was really cute and she wrote telegrams. She had an AT&T calling card and boy, did she use it to the fullest. She called from the airport, when she landed, when she was in her room. Because she was so spiritual, she felt she needed to pray with her goddaughter; that was me. She always prayed before her show. We would hold hands and then we'd go up onstage with her.

	











	We toured together. Everywhere she traveled she was the goddess of the goddesses. She would walk in first, everybody was waiting for her, and we were like little ducks. All of us, me, Marc [Anthony], Cheo [Feliciano], Oscar [D'León], we were all behind her going to all these beautiful places in Europe. She really believed in us. She thought we were coming with talent to bring light to salsa tropical.


	Celia was always an icon, a living legend. She had a lot of vocal control and a beautiful vibrato. Pedro helped her a lot. He quit the trumpet to make sure she was ready to get on that stage and sing her heart out. He was a great partner. She was very lucky to have him.


	In the studio she was a master of great ideas. I gave her a lot of energy, and it was great to have her there with me.


	She always told me that one of the things she liked about me was that she saw my talent and that I didn't have to wear little outfits. We're here as women, as talented women. She would say, “Sabes porqué he tenido exito? Porque yo vendo talento, no vendo sexo.” (“You know why I've been successful? Because I sell talent, not sex.”)


	Now, I see what she meant. It's a male-dominated world, and she wanted respect. She liked being on the road. She liked to take her music to different markets, and she loved shopping. Shopping and music, forget about it. Y su cafecito con su azucar.


	She always tried to encourage the new generation by being positive and working hard. She spoke about the perseverance of hard work, professionalism. Always record, arrive early and have a great orchestra behind you. And all that you get, you give back.

	I knew Celia's work because I studied music in Cuba, but I never got the chance to meet her in person. Since Celia was banned in Cuba, you couldn't hear her on the radio or see her on TV.


	Celia, Willy Chirino, all those artists were prohibited. She was always a defender of freedom.


	After recording “La Gonzadera,” we were trying to figure out how we could use her vocals from “La Negra Tiene Tumbao” in a song. Her digital session recordings from her last recordings were nowhere to be found, but after 10 years of searching with Omer [Perdillo, her manager], we finally found them.


	What we did was mix two songs together, closing it out with “La Negra Tiene Tumbao.”


	But for us, using her voice — can you imagine? As a kid, I'd hear some of her stuff with my dad through videos that had been leaked. Cuba only had two TV channels, and there was a concert she did, I think in Africa, that somehow got through. People had recorded it and we'd watch it. For us, it was such a point of pride. A Cuban woman who was outside of Cuba, yet so huge in the music world — it seemed impossible to reach that level. When I was little, people told me she was a singer who wasn't allowed in Cuba.


	When my dad heard the song, he was blown away. He was like, “How did you pull this off?” And I told him, “Dad, they gave me permission.” This whole story is so nostalgic for every Cuban, given the political situation. Everything feels so deep. In our country, there's so much music, so much art, but it dies there. It's heartbreaking to see so many artists who don't get the chance to share their work. I'm left with this sense of longing because I wasn't able to fully experience her work. And she has incredible songs. Celia was always ahead of the game when it came to music. She was someone who never let herself fall behind.

	











	I met Celia because my dad and an uncle promoted shows in Colombia and they brought José Alberto “El Canario” and Celia together to Buenaventura, Quibdó, and a show in Tuluá that didn't end up happening. But I traveled with her on the same bus from Buenaventura to Tuluá, and I got the chance to talk with her. She said something to my mom about me, and my mom made me sing. I was about 13 or 14 years old.


	I'd seen her on TV, but my dad collected albums and my mom was a huge fan of Celia. I've always been really close to my mom, and in many moments of her life, Celia's music was her soundtrack. “Ritmo, Tambor y Flores” was my first real connection to Celia. One of my aunts made me learn the song, and I sang it the first time I performed in a parade in Condoto. I was about 9 years old, and at my fifth-grade graduation, “Ritmo, Tambor y Flores” was already part of my repertoire. That's the song I sang to her on the bus.


	I went to see her in Buenaventura first. She was wearing white leggings, a shiny top and a short, white wig and she looked amazing. Like, wow — it wasn't often you saw women who could pull off a look like that. I saw music as something totally normal because my mom sang, my uncle brought artists and I'd go to the studios of Grupo Niche. I felt like I was part of the scene.


	So when they said, “Now we're heading to Tuluá on the bus with Celia and “El Canario,” it felt normal. She was traveling with her husband and it was a big, comfy bus. And she said, “What a beautiful little girl. She has something special.”


	My mom told me to sing “Ritmo, Tambor y Flores.” She started singing the chorus, and I sang the second part because I was feeling a little shy. She said, “Keep going, keep going.” And we all started singing together. Imagine that — my skin still tingles thinking about it. It feels like such a normal story, but honestly, it's not that normal. Especially because kids are usually pretty sheltered at that age. Later, when I was 15, I saw her again, and by then, she looked older, and I was so impressed by the respect people had for her and how she kept thriving as an artist, even as someone who was already so established. She was always in the big leagues. What's happening now isn't possible without talking about her. Her story needs to be told.

""The cops are shutting us down I am truly Amazed by how many of you showed up !!!"" the singer wrote on social media.

Lorde has given fans in New York City a preview of her new single after plans for an in-person event fell by the wayside thanks to local law enforcement.


	The New Zealand singer is currently preparing to launch new single “What Was That” on Friday (April 25), with the track serving as her first piece of solo music since 2021. The first taste of her upcoming fourth album, Lorde initially teased the single with her first-ever post on TikTok, sharing a video of herself walking through Washington Square Park in New York City while listening to the dreamy synth-pop track.

	In lieu of traditional social media updates, Lorde has since taken to connecting with fans by way of text messages and voice notes, with her legions of supporters receiving a message on Tuesday (April 22) which told fans to “meet me in the park” at 7pm.




			Trending on Billboard		







	As a result, fans flooded to Washington Square Park to hopefully catch a glimpse of the musician, though the gathered masses were soon urged to leave by local law enforcement. 


	Lorde took to her Instagram Stories soon after to address those who had turned out for the last-minute affair. “Omg @thepark the cops are shutting us down I am truly Amazed by how many of you showed up !!!” she wrote. “But they're telling me you gotta disperse … I'm so sorry.”


	According to Rolling Stone, a spokesperson for New York City's DCPI stated that officers had been alerted to an “unscheduled event” within the park, adding that a “sound and parks permit” is required to hold a concert event in a NYC park. “This individual did not possess either,” the statement added. “Organizers of the event were informed they could not perform and they left the location.”


	Fans who remained within Washington Square Park were rewarded for their patience, however, with the singer later showing up to play her new single. Though Lorde didn't perform the track live, she danced along to “What Was That” while it was being played by producer Dev Hynes of Blood Orange fame.


	Lorde's appearance in New York City comes just over a week after she made a surprise appearance during Charli XCX's Coachella set to guest on a performance of “Girl, So Confusing.”


	With her new single set to arrive in a matter of days, Lorde's new era is fast-approaching, telling fans in her recent voice note that “everything is about to change.” She added, “These are the last moments where it's just us, which is crazy. But so right. I'm so ready.”

	The revered hip-hop supergroup – comprising rapper Del the Funky Homosapien (aka Deltron Zero), producer Dan the Automator (the Cantankerous Captain Aptos) and turntablist Kid Koala – will be returning to the live stage this summer, launching a 16-date tour in Vancouver, BC on July 18 before traveling throughout the U.S. and Canada over the next three months.

	The tour will see Kid Koala pulling double duty as he opens the shows alongside Lealani, while the main event will see Deltron 3030 performing their self-titled debut album in full.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Originally released in May 2000, Deltron 3030 didn't reach dizzying commercial heights, instead peaking at No. 194 on the Billboard 200 and No. 18 on the Independent Albums charts. However, it was highly-regarded by critics, with the hip-hop concept album pairing stark social commentary with tongue-in-cheek humour as atmospheric beats accompanied narratives of dystopian society in the year 3030.


	Deltron 3030 were largely inactive in the years following their debut album's release, though they would re-emerge in 2013 with a sequel record titled Event 2. The album would hit No. 41 on the Billboard 200 and reach No. 6 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, with the group touring in earnest in the following years. 


	Currently, the release of a 2016 live album (fittingly-titled Live) is the group's latest commercial release, though Deltron 3030 have hinted towards a third studio LP in previous years. Alongside news of their forthcoming tour, it's been confirmed that a new record is indeed in the works, though it's likely that fans will have to wait until the completion of their live commitments before new material or updates arrive.

Senior Film Reporter


	20th Century Studios has dropped the first trailer for Predator: Badlands, the next anticipated live-action installment in the Predator franchise, which will be released in theaters and on IMAX November 7.


	The twist to this one? Man and extraterrestrial are on the same side. Starring Elle Fanning and Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi, the film is set in the future on a remote planet, where a young Predator (Schuster-Koloamatangi), outcast from his clan, finds an unlikely ally in Thia (Fanning) and embarks on a treacherous journey in search of the ultimate adversary.


	Dan Trachtenberg, the filmmaker behind 20th/Hulu smash Prey, directed the film, from his script written with Patrick Aison. He also produced alongside John Davis, Marc Toberoff, Ben Rosenblatt, and Brent O'Connor.Trachtenberg brought new life to Predator with Prey, a film unlike any other in the franchise, which centered on a young Comanche warrior's (Amber Midthunder) clash with Predators during the 1700s. In addition to setting viewership records for Hulu, it garnered six Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Television Movie. Upon his success there, Trachtenberg has seemingly been given the reins to the franchise, directing not only Badlands, but the animated Killer of Killers, premiering on Hulu June 6, as well.

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Monkeypaw Productions, the production company of Oscar-winning genre maestro Jordan Peele, has undergone layoffs within its development department, multiple sources tell Deadline.


	The layoffs have affected Christopher Rosati, Jamal M. Watson and Alex Kim, the company's three Vice Presidents of Development and Production, as well as four to five junior staffers at the coordinator and assistant levels.


	Word of layoffs at Monkeypaw comes ahead of the release of the company's football-themed horror film Him, one of the most anticipated genre titles of the year, from director Justin Tipping. Aside from economic realities facing the entire industry in this moment, in a time of contraction, the reasoning behind the cuts hasn't been made clear. Chatter about the company was widespread yesterday, with industry observers expecting that overhead at Monkeypaw had come down following a renegotiation of its overall deal with Universal Studio Group.

	











	However, sources close to the situation insist that there has been no change in Monkeypaw's USG overall deal. Inked in 2019, it it is believed to run through mid-next year.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Peele founded Monkeypaw in 2012, several years ahead of the conclusion of his lauded Comedy Central sketch series Key & Peele, as he reoriented his focus from performance to filmmaking, in the process quickly cementing himself as one of the most influential voices in contemporary cinema. Known for projects paring genre thrills with incisive social commentary, the company broke out with Peele's directorial debut, Get Out, which grossed over $255 million worldwide against a reported budget of $4.5 million, scoring four Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, and a win for Peele's original screenplay, in a rare feat for a genre film.


	Since Get Out, Peele has helmed the 2019 doppelganger horror flick Us — which wowed with its $70.3 million domestic opening, one of the best for any original film in recent memory, on its way to over $216 million worldwide — and the alien invasion-themed Nope, which grossed over $171M in 2022. Described by industry insiders as a highly methodical filmmaker who takes his time with development, Peele was originally set to unveil an untitled fourth feature, which remains a complete mystery, in December 2024. Following the double strike, the project was pushed back to October 23, 2026.

	











	Monkeypaw's upcoming Him follows a promising young football player (former college athlete Tyriq Withers) who is invited to train at the isolated compound of a dynasty team's aging QB1 (Marlon Wayans), learning from him the kinds of sacrifice that greatness demands. Based on a Black List script by Zack Akers & Skip Bronkie, the film is due to hit theaters September 19.

Senior Film Reporter


	Amazon MGM Studios on Wednesday morning dropped the first trailer for Heads of State, its buddy action comedy reuniting The Suicide Squad‘s John Cena and Idris Elba, which is slated to debut on streaming on July 2.


	Directed by Ilya Naishuller, the filmmaker behind Hardcore Henry (2015) and Bob Odenkirk starrer Nobody (2021), Heads of State is about two government leaders who must set aside their rivalry to thwart a global conspiracy and save the world — if they can work together. Elba plays UK Prime Minister Sam Clarke, with Cena as U.S. President. When the duo become the targets of a powerful and ruthless foreign adversary — who proves more than a match for the two leaders' security forces — they are begrudgingly forced to rely on the only two people they can trust: each other. Along their journey to save the free world, they find a key ally in Noel Bisset, a brilliant MI6 agent played by Priyanka Chopra Jonas.

The trailer for the long-awaited sequel “I Know What You Did Last Summer” was released online Tuesday, April 22nd. The bloody slasher flick brings franchise stars Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. back for more carnage after 27 years.

“This isn't the first time there's been violence like this in Southport,” Prinze Jr.'s character Ray Bronson says in the trailer to a group of concerned townspeople. We hear him continue, “It's not going to stop,” as the trailer cuts to a picture of his real-life wife Sarah Michelle Gellar, who played fan favorite character Helen Shivers in the 1997 original film. The two actors met while shooting the first movie in their early 20s. Making it full circle, the couple was on the set together for this new film in Australia last year, when Prinze Jr. was working and Gellar was visiting.

Hewitt's character Julie James makes a triumphant final girl return towards the end of the trailer. Seemingly on a busy college campus, she turns around to ask Chase Sui Wonders' character, “I just have one question: What did you do last summer?” The trailer doesn't show any footage of Hewitt and Prinze Jr. in a scene together, but fans can hope!

What's old is new again in this Sony legacy sequel, or “legacyquel.” From the story's setting (Southport, North Carolina), to the inciting incident (young friends hit someone with their car and try to cover it up), and the vengeful stalker's costume (a dark fisherman's slicker), horror lovers are happy to experience déjà vu in this case. The franchise's signature weapon, a big pointy hook, of course gets its closeup in both the trailer and the film's first official poster.

The recurring imagery doesn't stop there: Madelyn Cline's character opens a card with the title message “I know what you did last summer” scrawled inside (just like Hewitt's character did in 1997); Tyriq Withers' character stands shirtless in a steamy, and dangerous, gym shower (like Ryan Phillippe‘s character in the original); and Gabbriette's character tries to escape the attacker on an old hand operated elevator (matching a scene with Gellar's character). Hewitt recently told People about the sequel, saying, “There's lots of '90s in there, so get excited because the '90s are back again!”

It's obvious from these visuals and more that director Jennifer Kaytin Robinson and her screenwriters are big fans of the original. Robinson, who previously directed Gellar in the film “Do Revenge,” told People in early April, “We approached it like super fans, so I think people are going to be really happy. All the things that you want to see in this movie, you're going to see in this movie.”

Robinson also just told Entertainment Weekly who else she wanted in this film: her other “Do Revenge” actors Maya Hawke and Camila Mendes. “I actually tried to get Maya Hawke, and we couldn't work it out with schedules.” Mendes was hired to be in the film last summer, but had to exit the project due to her demanding schedule with another film reboot, “Masters of the Universe.” She was replaced by Wonders. Robinson tried “relentlessly” to have Gellar return as her 1997 character, but Gellar adamantly declined because (spoiler) her character died after an iconic chase scene.

As for Brandy Norwood, whose character Karla (spoiler) survived the events of the 1998 sequel “I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,” Robinson simply teased to People, “You'll have to go see the movie.” Last summer, Norwood showed interest in returning and had told The Hollywood Reporter, “I need them to give me a call!” That soundbite sent shockwaves through the horror community, so cross your fingers we see at least a cameo from her in the new film out July 18th, 2025.

In the world of wrestling entertainment, things don't always go according to plan. Whether it's a wrestler missing their cue or the referee botching counts, keeping all the various storylines and outrageous antics in check can be difficult. 

At night 2 of WWE‘s WrestleMania 41, “Stone Cold” Steve Austin came out on his ATV, like he's done numerous times in the past. But this time, the WWE Hall of Famer's joyride came to an abrupt end as he lost control and drove straight into a barrier.

A post shared by Uncrowned (@uncrowned)

The crowd at Allegiant Stadium was overjoyed at the sound of shattering glass on the speakers. This signaled the arrival of WWE legend “Stone Cold” Steve Austin. The sold-out stadium cheered wildly as he drove his four-wheeler out and cruised around the ring several times. Unfortunately, one of his corner turns was way too wide, and he crashed straight into the ringside barrier. 

A woman was seen on video standing in front of the blockade, celebrating Austin's arrival with everyone else. After he hit the barrier, she was knocked backward. TMZ reported that the woman looked furious, but others alleged that she was overreacting.

“She did the best work of the night, how she fall seconds after the thing already hit the barricade?” One X user posted. “She sold that fall better than the entire AEW roster,” another fan wrote.

After the crash, Austin leaned forward and said something to the fan before hopping up onto the stage. While Austin was on stage, he announced the Sunday attendance of 63,226. He then claimed that there must have been more people there. He slowly began counting the crowd himself, but only made it to 18 before he gave up. 

While Austin chugged a couple of cans of beer on stage, WWE President Khan came over to check on the woman. Upon exiting the ring, Austin stopped to talk to her again. 

Austin was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on Saturday night. It was his second induction, as he had been inducted for the first time in 2009. This time, he received the honor for the “Immortal Moments” category, in recognition of his WrestleMania 13 match against Bret Hart.

The main event on Sunday was the match between John Cena and Cody Rhodes. Cena made history by winning the match and his 17th championship title.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Lisa Vanderpump Shares Her Thoughts About Garcelle Beauvais' RHOBH Departure","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/lisa-vanderpump-garcelle-beauvais-rhobh-departure/","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 06:43:58 GMT","

Former “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Lisa Vanderpump is sharing her support for Garcelle Beauvais following her recent decision to exit the Bravo series.

While speaking to TMZ in April 2025, Vanderpump, who exited RHOBH following the show's 9th season, said Beauvais is “a wonderful woman.”

“I'm sure she's kind of moving on to other things. It kind of served her well, and I wish her lots of luck,” said Vanderpump to the publication. 

Vanderpump made similar comments about Beauvais' exit during an April 2025 interview with Us Weekly. She said she would continue to not watch RHOBH, especially now that Beauvais has left the Bravo series. 

“There's no upside for me watching it. The only one I really liked was Garcelle [Beauvais] — I have a good relationship with her. Now it's time for her to move on. She was somebody before and she'll be somebody after. Not everybody's like that. A lot of people are defined by Housewives,” said Vanderpump during the Us Weekly interview. 

A post shared by Lisa Vanderpump (@lisavanderpump)

During the April 2025 interview with TMZ, Vanderpump said she would not come back to RHOBH. 

“That's a hard no,” said Vanderpump to TMZ. 

Vanderpump made similar comments about possibly returning to RHOBH while speaking to Us Weekly in April 2025. She said she would not come back to the Bravo franchise unless there were changes made to its cast. 

“That's a hard no, unless it was a group of different women I really liked,” said Vanderpump in the Us Weekly interview. 

Vanderpump also gave her opinion about RHOBH during a December 2024 interview with Access Hollywood. She said she would not consider coming back to the series. In addition, she gave an update on her dynamic with her former friend and castmate, Kyle Richards. According to Vanderpump, she would not mend her friendship with Richards unless she received an apology. 

A post shared by Garcelle Beauvais (@garcelle)

According to BravoTV.com, Beauvais revealed she would no longer film for RHOBH in a March 2025 Instagram video. 

“I have some news: I've decided to leave Beverly Hills. It's been a wild ride — I mean, some amazing things have happened, and some hard things have also happened — but it's been a ride nevertheless,” said Beauvais while filming the video. 

She said one of the reasons she left RHOBH following season 14 was because she wanted to spend time with her younger sons, Jaid and Jax.  

“Their last year of high school is next year and I want to be a part of that. And Jaid is starting a new [modeling] career and I want to be a part of that too,” said Beauvais. 

She also said she has been busy working as an actress and producer. 

“Secondly, I have the most exciting projects that I am developing, producing, and acting in. I can't tell you anything right now, but you'll know soon,” said Beauvais in her Instagram video.

Not every actor enjoys working with Marvel but their roles in the cinematic universe can do wonders for their bank accounts.

Take Sebastian Stan who, even as an actor who had been working steadily since 2007, wasn't getting much heat before he became Bucky Barnes – also known as The Winter Soldier.

The actor spoke to Vanity Fair about his previous career struggles and how his life in Romania shaped him.

Stan was having trouble finding work before landing the Winter Soldier spot in 2011's “Captain America: The First Avenger.” 

“I was actually struggling with work. I had just gotten off the phone with my business manager, who told me I was saved by $65,000 that came in residuals from ‘Hot Tub Time Machine,' he told Vanity Fair.

Prior to “Hot Tub Time Machine,” Stan took roles in smaller movies like 2008's “Rachel Getting Married” and 2006's “The Covenant.” He also appeared in the show “Gossip Girl” over the course of several seasons.

Marvel producer Kevin Feige wanted to find a darker version of The Winter Soldier. He thought casting then practically unknown Stan would be a good fit.

“You could see that he has so much inside him and so much behind his eyes,” Feige recalls. “I'll never forget that. I said to Stephen Broussard, who was one of the producers on Captain America, ‘He's going to be a good Bucky, but he's going to be a great Winter Soldier.'”

Stan will have taken on the role of The Winter Soldier ten times by the time 2026's “Avengers: Doomsday” is released.

The Vanity Fair piece also reveals that Stan and his mother moved to New York when he was a kid. Stan would reconnect with his father and develop a relationship with him until his death in 2021.

Stan is also a fan of taking chances in his work. His fellow actors find the trait endearing.

“Sebastian has always been really fearless,” said “Captain America” star Chris Evans. “You can see that in his choices. He takes big swings. When that Trump movie was kicking around, I remember thinking, I wonder who is going to take this job? It's just got so many strings attached to it. And I was so unsurprised when I heard it was Sebastian.”

Stan's “The Martian” and “The 355” co-star Jessica Chastain also praised his choices.

“When we were on set for “The 355,” that's when he first told me he had had the offer to play Donald Trump. A thing about Sebastian that people might not realize is he's very, very thoughtful, almost to a point where he overthinks things,” Chastain told Vanity Fair. 

“It could cause a little bit of stress. He was like, ‘Well, what do you think? What would you do?' I said, ‘Do it.' I was like, ‘What do you have to lose? Take a risk.' As long as it doesn't cause you physical danger, if something scares you—do it.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Lionel Richie & Pope Francis: Music Legend Shares Fascinating Details of Their Time Together","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/lionel-richie-met-pope-francis-photos/","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:51:01 GMT","

Among the many celebrities paying tribute to Pope Francis is “American Idol” judge Lionel Richie, who opened up about the “wonderful” meeting he had with the leader of the Catholic Church in 2019. 

On April 21, 2025, the Vatican confirmed the Pope had died of a cerebral stroke on Easter Monday, per the Associated Press. He was 88. 

Later that day, Richie took media questions after judging the two-hour, live “American Idol” episode during which he, Carrie Underwood, and Luke Bryan made their final picks for the top 14. He looked pained when a reporter from Extra asked about the “sad news” that Pope Francis had died, and then shared why their meeting was so special to him. 

A post shared by LisaParigi 陳 (@lisaparigi)

Richie met Pope Francis in December 2019 when he, “Britain's Got Talent” alum Susan Boyle, and 80s singer Bonnie Tyler were invited to the Vatican to perform a Christmas concert with an underlying theme of environmentalism, according to Rome Report. 

While there, Richie posted a photo of himself on Facebook and wrote, “Not every day you get to have an audience with the Pope at the Vatican.” Boyle also posted a Facebook photo of her with Richie and Tyler, noting that their concert would raise money for the Amazon rainforest. 

Recalling that day, Richie told Extra, “I had the wonderful pleasure of meeting him. (He was) warm, accessible, they kept trying to say to him, ‘Uh, you need to be over here.' He walks out … walks off stage and into the crowd! And when he walks up to you, it's as if he knows you.” 

“I meet a lot of people every day, every night,” Richie continued. “(But) he does it every day — masses of people! And when he's speaking to you — he spoke to my party, me, as if we've been friends for the longest time.” 

“I'm going to miss him,” Richie told Extra, “because he was in touch. You can say what you want to say, but he was in touch with a common person. Didn't matter what part of the world you're from, he knew how to relate. And my philosophy has always been, as my grandmother would say, ‘If you know how to treat somebody in Alabama, it applies around the world.'” 

“He came from Italy,” Richie added, “but he knew how to talk to everybody around the world.”

On April 21, Richie's longtime love Lisa Parigi posted throwback photos of them with Pope Francis at the event and wrote, “There are moments that stay with you forever—this is one of them. 🤍 Feeling so blessed. #popefrancis”

A post shared by Lionel Richie (@lionelrichie)

Richie is not Catholic, but was raised as a Christian in Tuskegee, Alabama.  

In 2012, he told The Guardian, “God is wherever I am. I was born and raised a Christian, but I've learned from my travels that God has many names. When you see yourself as a citizen of the world, then you respect where you are. Buddha, Allah, and Jesus all lead to the same thing – a higher consciousness.”

When he left for college, he told People in 2019, he thought he might become an Episcopal priest — until he discovered music and girls.  

“I left my mom and dad's house to go to Tuskegee University, and I met my Commodore friends there,” he told the outlet. “At the time I was seriously considering being an Episcopal priest. (But) the first time I played with the Commodores, a group of girls screamed. Up until that moment no one, no girl had ever screamed at me.” 

Richie opened the three-hour “American Idol” Easter special on April 20 by singing his 2009 song “Eternity,” backed by the top 24 contestants. Joking to Extra that he was “Reverend Richie” for a moment, he said he loved getting to start the show with such a meaningful message. 

“When they asked me to do it first, I was honored,” he told the outlet. “That song has been in my catalog for a while and I said, ‘Okay, let's pull that out.' And I've received so many people saying ‘Where'd that song come from?!'”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Next ‘Golden Bachelor' Is Officially Named","https://entertainmentnow.com/the-bachelor/next-golden-bachelor-is-officially-named/","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 15:54:03 GMT","

The next “Golden Bachelor” has been named.

According to ABC, he is Mel Owens, “a retired NFL player and attorney.”

ABC's page for “The Golden Bachelor” features a photo of Owens.

Owens' X page describes him as, “Former NFL Player for the Rams. Partner and Attorney at Law for Namanny, Byrne & Owens, protecting players' rights to receive Workers' Comp.” He hasn't posted on that page since 2014, but his LinkedIn page indicates he remains at the same law firm.

“On this all-new unscripted series, one hopeless romantic is given a second chance at love in the search for a partner with whom to share the sunset years of life,” the page reads. “The women arriving at the mansion have a lifetime of experience, living through love, loss and laughter, hoping for a spark that ignites a future full of endless possibilities. In the end, will our Golden man turn the page to start a new chapter with the woman of his dreams?”

Owens was previously married and met his ex-wife in California, according to E! Online.

A divorce filing shows that Fabiana Owens filed for divorce from Mel Tyrae Owens in 2020 in Orange County, with the case being described as “dissolution with child.”

The X page for “The Golden Bachelor” also shared the big news as well as some details about Owens.

“He's 66 and single — for now. Meet Mel Owens, a former NFL player-turned-lawyer, proud father, and your next Golden Bachelor,” the page reads.

The choice of Owens will surprise some people because many fans were expecting the next “Golden Bachelor” to be one of the men from Joan Vassos's season of “The Golden Bachelorette.” Some of those men have already gone on to find relationships, however. The first “Golden Bachelor” was Indiana's Gerry Turner, but his marriage to finalist Theresa Nist ended up in divorce.

It's not clear when the second season of “The Golden Bachelor” will air. 

“A premiere date for the upcoming show will be announced at a later date,” ABC wrote.

According to People, Owens “graduated from the University of Michigan and was selected as the ninth overall pick in the 1981 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams.”

He retired from the NFL, and Owens “moved to Orange County, California and began practicing law, aiming to help clients seek justice for sports-related injuries,” People reported.

According to ABC, Owens “shares two sons with his first love” and is from Detroit, Michigan. 

“While life took an unexpected turn with the passing of his father and the end of his marriage, Owens channeled his energy into being the best father he could be, focusing on raising his sons and coaching their extracurricular sports teams,” a press release says, according to ABC.

Owens' dad, Walt Owens, was also a successful athlete.

“An outstanding athlete, Owens starred in baseball, basketball and cross country at Detroit Northwestern High School before going on to attend Western Michigan University. While at WMU, Owens played for the Detroit Stars in the Negro Leagues from 1953-55, where he was an outfielder and pitcher,” the NIU Huskies wrote in a tribute when Walt Owens died.

“He earned his bachelor's degree from Western Michigan in 1955 where, as a senior, he ran on the Broncos 880-yard relay team that set a Mid-American Conference record. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Detroit Baseball Federation recorded his batting average as .379. Later in life, he became a standout competitive slow-pitch softball player, developing a notorious pitching style,” it says.

ABC described Owens as being from a “close-knit Midwestern family.”

A recommendation on his LinkedIn page reads, “Mel is an excellent attorney. He got great results on the case he handled for me. He applies the same principles of hard work and persistence as an attorney that he applied in his professional football career.”

That page says he has worked at NBO Law for more than 19 years representing athletes.

The 78th edition will now include Ramsay's “Die, My Love,” starring Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson, in the competition.

Here, Jennifer Lawrence plays a wife unraveling in the country, and married to Pattinson's character. LaKeith Stanfield, Nick Nolte, and Sissy Spacek also star in this adaptation of Ariana Harwicz's novel. Ramsay wrote the script with Enda Walsh and Alice Birch.

Meanwhile, “Woman and Child,” the latest film by Iranian director Saeed Roustaee, will also join the competition this year. Roustaee was nominated for the Palme d'Or in 2022 for “Leila's Brothers,” a three-hour family epic starring frequent Asghar Farhadi collaborator Taraneh Alidoosti.

Olivia Wilde is back in the director's chair, as the “Booksmart” and “Don't Worry Darling” filmmaker is currently filming her third directorial outing, “The Invite,” per Variety. Wilde, who also had a small role in “Don't Worry Darling,” will also appear in the film, alongside a cast that also includes Seth Rogen (who she recently appeared alongside in “The Studio”), Penélope Cruz, and Edward Norton. Principal photography has started in Los Angeles.

Per Variety, the film is billed as “a provocative date night comedy inspired by the Spanish film ‘Sentimental.'” The original 2020 film, directed by Cesc Gay, was a smash in Spain and was nominated for multiple Goyas (winning Best Supporting Actor for star Alberto San Juan). The film follows two couples, neighbors who do not quite get along, who come together for a dinner date night that inspires some unexpected (and, we're guessing, sexy and funny) revelations.

Gay's film has already been remade in several countries, including Italy, Switzerland and France. The script for Wilde's film was adapted by Rashida Jones and Will McCormack, best known for their 2012 romantic dramedy “Celeste & Jesse Forever.” 

An earlier version of the film was set to be directed by “Little Miss Sunshine” duo Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton, and was to star Amy Adams, Paul Rudd, and Tessa Thompson. That version was announced in 2023 but flamed out at some point.

Wilde's directing card is quite full these days, and she's also attached to direct Universal Pictures' Christmas comedy “Naughty” and Warner Bros.' “Avengelyne,” a film adaptation of the '90s comic book character, both of which will be produced by  LuckyChap. Also coming up: a starring role in Gregg Araki's much-anticipated “I Want Your Sex.”

The film is produced by FilmNation Entertainment's Ben Browning, Annapurna Pictures' Megan Ellison, and David Permut. Patrick Chu, Annapurna Head of Film and Television, is executive producing. FilmNation Entertainment and Annapurna Pictures are co-financing.

FilmNation Entertainment is co-repping domestic rights with UTA Independent Film Group and is handling international sales. The deals were negotiated by FilmNation Entertainment's Alison Cohen and Ben Ryzak and Chris Corabi on behalf of Annapurna.

This time, the Predator is one of the good guys. “Predator” franchise installment “Predator: Badlands” turns the trope on its side with the title creature instead helping the lead hero defeat a different threat.

“Predator: Badlands” stars Elle Fanning as Thia, a woman living on a remote planet that befriends a young Predator (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi) who is an outcast from his clan. Together, they “embark on a treacherous journey in search of the ultimate adversary,” as the official synopsis reads. “Prey” director Dan Trachtenberg helms the film, with Patrick Aison penning the screenplay.

 










Trachtenberg told Empire that Fanning was pushed “dramatically, physically, [and] logistically” during production. “She faced intense challenges on this movie,” Trachtenberg said. Internet sleuths have already guessed that in certain frames, Fanning's Thia could be a Weyland-Yutani android.

Trachtenberg added that “Predator: Badlands” differs from previous franchise films as the alien creature will be “front and center, leading the charge” instead. “He's still badass, but there's something there that touches you emotionally, too,” Trachtenberg said of the Predator played by Schuster-Koloamatangi. “Creating a character you connect with, but are also super-intimidated by, has been challenging. But exciting.”

Trachtenberg previously directed “Predator” prequel “Prey,” which debuted on Hulu. “Prey” took place in 1719 and followed an Indigenous woman (Amber Midthunder) who fought for survival against alien invaders. Trachtenberg told Empire that he wanted to “find another essential piece of cinema that does what ‘Prey' did spiritually — pushing the franchise's boundaries, letting us root for a hero we rarely get to root for — but in a different way. And that transformed into this big idea of rooting for the Predator.”

The “Predator” franchise began in 1987 with the original movie that starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, late actor Carl Weathers, and Jesse Ventura. A trio of sequels followed, released in 1990, 2010, and 2018, as well as 2004 spin-off “Alien vs. Predator.”

“Predator: Badlands” is produced by Trachtenberg, John Davis, Marc Toberoff, Ben Rosenblatt, and Brent O'Connor. The film will be released in in IMAX, Dolby Cinema, Cinemark XD, 4DX, ScreenX, and premium screens everywhere.

 










“Predator: Badlands” premieres November 7 in theaters from 20th Century Studios. Check out the teaser below.

Pete Davidson is staying humble about his “SNL” experience. The actor, who starred on “Saturday Night Live” from 2014 to 2022, told Variety that there are “hundreds” of fellow cast members who “did better work” than him during his tenure on the sketch series. 

Davidson first joined at age 20 as a featured player. He later parted ways with the live show in May 2022; however, he returned for the “SNL50” event in 2025. 

“I think I was very lucky to get my own own video [during the ‘SNL50' special],” Davidson said. “There's 1,000 cast members and hundreds that are more popular and did better work than I did while I was there. I was just very grateful to be in a sketch and have a video and even just be invited. It was very surreal to see.”

Davidson added, “I know I was there for almost a decade but even when I came back and hosted, I was like, ‘Wow, I do know all these guys.' I know [creator] Lorne [Michaels], I know most of the cast. It just hits different when you see, like, Meryl Streep doing a sketch. And I also know it was a bunch of people who were in nothing so I'm just very grateful. It was a really surreal moment, and I'm happy that it went well for Lorne and just for the history and the integrity of the institution.” 

He added that Michaels, who executive produced Davidson's meta Peacock series “Bupkis,” was a father figure to him. Davidson famously lost his dad in 9/11. 

“Yeah, he's like my dad kind of. He's really, really sweet,” he said of Michaels, “and has always been above and beyond understanding of my life, and just supportive in all the right ways. I'm very lucky.” 

Davidson previously told Jon Berthnal during his “Real Ones” podcast that he at times felt like a “loser” due to his celebrity status. “Suddenly you're in this zeitgeist and that has nothing to do with the work,” Davidson said of his tabloid-driven fame while on the series. “And that's a really shitty feeling. I became more known before the work was there, but I was always working.”

He added of certain quips at his expense, “When your own show [pokes fun at you], I'd be sitting in the back watching the cold open and — the cold open [is] topical, political humor, whatever's in the culture. And then, making fun of you. Then you've got to walk out and do a sketch next and hit your mark and the show just made fun of you. So, why are they going to laugh at you? Like, they just dogged you in front of everyone. And you're like, ‘I'm a fucking loser, man.'”

 










Yet Davidson has always credited Michaels for having his back. “Nobody ever showed more leeway and grace to me than [‘SNL‘ creator] Lorne Michaels, and I owe my life to that guy,” he said, “but it was fucking confusing cause the nature of entertainment is the nature of this business. At the end of the day, that's what it is. This was a really difficult thing to do. You feel small. You feel super insecure.”

Charles Melton is following in Ryan Gosling's footsteps and collaborating with iconic auteur Nicolas Winding Refn. Melton, who recently starred in Alex Garland's “Warfare,” is set to lead Refn's thriller “Her Private Hell,” as Neon announced. Sophie Thatcher, Kristine Froseth, and Havana Rose Liu are also starring. 

Refn will be writing and directing the feature, which is expected to start shooting this summer. The “Drive” and “Only God Forgives” director who is famously against streaming “content” has partnered with Neon to co-finance and distribute the film. 

 










Refn confirmed in 2024 that he would be making his return to helming features almost a decade after 2016 film “The Neon Demon.” At the time, the unnamed project was announced to be shooting in Tokyo in 2025; it seems this could be “Her Private Hell.”

“It's a really interesting time to make movies because it's such a chaotic situation,” Refn told Variety of the film. “So going back and making a theatrical feature film again is almost like — not starting over — but with all the changes in our societies in the last five years and technology changes, it almost seems like the right thing to do for me.”

While no plot details were revealed at the time, Refn teased that the film “will have a lot of glitter and lot of sex and violence.” As if we'd expect anything else from the auteur…

Refn is also working on a gaming project, as he considers it the “only art form that continues to evolve with possibilities creatively,” adding, “In a way, had the Lumiere brothers, when they invented film, invented computer games first, what would the world look like?” 

However, Refn also said that “feature film is still the mother of all mediums” and with his latest, he's excited to “re-experience that process.” The director continued, “I think it's hard for me to escape my self-indulgent identity in creativity. So there will always be me in it.”

“Her Private Hell” star Melton is a “Riverdale” alum and earned critical acclaim for Todd Haynes' “May December.” In addition to “Warfare,” Melton will appear in “Beef” Season 2. Thatcher, who got her start in “Yellowjackets,” recently led horror films “Companion” and “Heretic.”

That gum you like is going to come back in style — and on MUBI.

Thirty-five years after “Twin Peaks” premiered, and just months after late auteur and series co-creator David Lynch died at age 78, the series in all its entirety will stream on MUBI this June.

Lynch and Mark Frost co-created cult classic show “Twin Peaks,” which premiered in 1990 on ABC. The second season aired in 1991 before being canceled by the network; it was later revived in 2017 at Showtime with “Twin Peaks: The Return,” a limited event series. All seasons will come to MUBI starting June 13, with all 30 episodes of “Twin Peaks” and all 18 parts of “Twin Peaks: The Return” on the platform.

The first two seasons of “Twin Peaks” followed FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) as he investigates the murder of homecoming queen Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) in the border town of Twin Peaks. 




			Popular on IndieWire		






MacLachlan, as well as many other members of the ensemble cast, reprised their respective roles for “Twin Peaks: The Return.” Lynch directed the entire 18-part limited event series, which was set 25 years after Laura Palmer's murder.

“Twin Peaks” is written and executive produced by Lynch and Frost, with Sabrina S. Sutherland executive producing. The series is distributed by Paramount Global Content Distribution. 

Both iterations of the series will still remain on the Paramount+/Showtime platform in addition to streaming on MUBI. A representative for MUBI told IndieWire that the deal between MUBI and Paramount Global was specifically made for “Twin Peaks.” The series will be available on MUBI in the following territories: US, LATAM, TR, NL, IN, UK/IE, DE, IT. 

“Twin Peaks” star MacLachlan previously said during Canneseries 2024 that the cast all “recognized how weird ‘Twin Peaks' was” upon its 1990 debut. “We didn't think it would get past ‘one and done,'” MacLachlan said of the first season, “and thought it might become a movie of the week but said that we had to be part of it because it is David Lynch.”

Lynch did in fact originally plan for film “Mulholland Drive” to be a sequel set within the world of “Twin Peaks,” however the idea was abandoned. The style of “Twin Peaks” would in part define the term Lynchian in reference to Lynch's tone and aesthetic. 

 










“Launching ‘Twin Peaks' alongside ‘Twin Peaks: A Limited Event Series' is a dream for MUBI, bringing one of the most loved and discussed series in TV history to the platform,” Katharina Feistauer, VP Global Head of Programming, MUBI, said. “Whilst this launch has been months in the making, the sad news of David Lynch's death only a few weeks ago makes this opportunity to show his iconic work even more special. We are excited for the Lynch fans in our membership to revisit the episodes comprehensively, as well creating an opportunity for new audiences to discover it for the first time.” 

MUBI is a global film distributor, streaming service, and production company.

Lorde debuted her forthcoming new single, “What Was That,” on Tuesday evening, April 22, at New York's Washington Square Park. The singer stood on a wooden platform at the center of the park's now-dormant fountain and sang along to the track as it played from a minimal speaker stack, according to footage shared online. Watch a clip on X.

Earlier today, Lorde teased the pop-up appearance with a message shared via her fan text line: “Meet me in the park Tonight 7pm -xx.” When 7 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time rolled around, she followed up with a post to her Instagram story, informing attendees that the event had been shut down by park rangers and local police. “I am truly Amazed by how many of you showed up !!!” it read, in part. “But they're telling me you gotta disperse … I'm so sorry.”

Much of the crowd stuck around for the next hour, however, until Blood Orange's Devonté Hynes—who is speculated to have worked on Lorde's next album—arrived with a rolling speaker blasting “What Was That” and led them out of the park. Lorde finally showed up after 9 p.m., pausing to thank the assembled fans before launching into her song. Newly revealed lyrics include the following: “I'm missing you/And all the things we used to do/MDMA in the back garden, blow our pupils up/We kissed for hours straight but baby, what was that?/I remember saying then/This is the best cigarette of my life/Well I want you just like that.”

Lorde first teased “What Was That” via a snippet posted to TikTok, accompanied by a video of her strutting around Washington Square Park. She recently made an appearance at Charli XCX's weekend one Coachella set and collaborated with New Zealand singer-songwriter Marlon Williams. Her latest studio album to date is 2021's Solar Power.

Leave it to Deerhoof to empathize with Frankenstein's monster. The prolific quartet has spent much of its career finding beauty in ugliness: post-apocalyptic cave drawings, a child-snatching milkman, chirpy noise-pop blasts about crows and ducks and Satan and more Satan. Their records remain coarse, raucous, immune to the veneer of staid professionalism that tends to afflict bands in their fourth decade of existence.

Noble and Godlike in Ruin, either the noise-rock group's 19th or 20th album (depending on whether you count the little-heard 1996 curio Dirt Pirate Creed), certainly is. It takes its unusual title from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, a source of inspiration. Drummer Greg Saunier describes the album as “our low-budget, DIY Frankenstein: A sensitive, spurned, intelligent, dehumanized creature made out of people.” The record cover, a scraggly collage of the bandmates' faces, stitched together, reflects the idea: a Deerhoofstein, if you will.

After several years of one-off experiments—a rapid-fire covers album, a first-ever Japanese-language album, a solo record from Saunier—the group returns to what you might call straightforwardly Deerhoof territory on Noble and Godlike in Ruin. But put the emphasis on Deerhoof, not straightforward. This is one of the band's most abrasive albums to date, with mangled, fractured grooves like “Sparrow Sparrow” and “Ha, Ha Ha Ha, Haaa” that simulate the experience of realizing your open tabs are playing multiple songs simultaneously. An anarchic free-jazz squawk weaves its way through “Who Do You Root For?,” while “Disobedience” is as queasy and discordant as the mutiny Satomi Matsuzaki seems to be singing about: “99 to 1/Captain has a gun,” she cheerily exclaims. Songs don't end so much as collapse into cacophonous outros.

While Deerhoof's last album, 2023's Miracle-Level, captured the serrated immediacy of their live performances, Noble and Godlike in Ruin is cluttered and dense, sometimes overwhelmingly so. Everything feels stitched together, almost surgical—like, well, a Frankenstein monster. When the approach works, it's exciting: “Kingtoe” has a perverse refrain (“You make machines/And I am one!”) and a woozy melody held together by a toy-like piano riff, with Matsuzaki's interlocking vocals coming together in a round at the end. When it doesn't, the band's raw power is undermined by jumbled, overstuffed arrangements, as on the aforementioned “Disobedience.” There's a majestic ballad lurking somewhere in “A Body of Mirrors,” but the maximalist arrangement gives it little room to breathe.

Because the group's sensibility is filtered through Matsuzaki's childlike wonder, Deerhoof haven't always been thought of as a political band. Critics too often shrugged off their lyrics as nonsense. But longtime fans will recognize a radical leftist spirit that's infiltrated their songwriting in recent years, with songs like 2014's “Exit Only” and 2020's “New Orphan Asylum for Spirited Deerchildren” taking surreal aim at the excess cruelties of modern American life. (As for walking the walk, they premiered this album's lead single on Craigslist, a rare tech platform that “isn't blatantly supporting fascism.”)

Here, as ever, Deerhoof's songs identify with the voiceless and oppressed, whether Matsuzaki is calling out to “my aliens/Lost, despised or feared” on “Overrated Species Anyhow” or comparing herself to Pinocchio on “Ha, Ha Ha Ha, Haaa” (the song's title is a phonetic representation of its chorus). Guest rapper Saul Williams summons some climate-collapse rhymes on the rightfully panicked “Under Rats,” but the most politically potent moment comes later, with “Immigrant Songs,” a sequel of sorts to “Exit Only.” Over the album's most pared-down arrangement, Matsuzaki, who was born in Japan, sings about how it feels to be an immigrant in Trump's America: “But you think we're in your house,” she repeats. “You are mistaken!” The song ends abruptly, and the album closes out with nearly four minutes of ear-screeching feedback and screaming. The lyric sheet renders it as “LAAAAAAA!,” but its meaning isn't hard to parse.

April 23, 2025

Is the dancefloor a place of refuge? Of abandon? Of liberation? Or perhaps a place of obliteration? It's complicated. In the four decades that he's been clubbing, Chicago's Jamal Moss has likely seen it all. He cut his teeth sweating it out at the Music Box to Ron Hardy, a pioneering house DJ known for the intensity and audacity of his mixing. He lived through the Reagan era, the “war on drugs,” the AIDS crisis. Poverty was rife and times were tough, but inside the club, it didn't matter: “We were just there to be free of that shit,” Moss says. Over the years, the world that Hardy and his acolytes helped create, the alternate realities they helped foment, went global. The music spread, morphed, put down new roots. The formerly underground became commonplace. House music had always aspired to universalism; now, at last, the whole damn universe embraced house music. You'd think it might be cause for celebration. And yet inside the club, Moss says, “40 years later, it's drastically different—everybody's angry!”

To Moss, the DJ and producer best known as Hieroglyphic Being, there's a paradox at work. Anti-harassment campaigns, no-camera policies, Narcan-toting DJs, seasoned bouncers to sift out the troublemakers and rubberneckers—all these measures are meant to ensure patrons' safety and preserve the vibe. And yet, Moss says, “look around and a good percent of people in the club are not happy.” Dance Music 4 Bad People is Moss' vexed response to the peevish mood.

His first album for Oslo's Smalltown Supersound, it's approximately Moss' umpteenth record, once you factor in releases from aliases like I.B.M. (Insane Black Man), the Sun God, and Members Only, his seemingly limitless series of bootleg edits, and it's entirely true to form: a surging maelstrom of machine music, synths swollen and drums bleeding into the red, ready to go off the rails at any moment. A nostalgic return to happier times this ain't; more like an indictment of the current malaise via a defense of the dancefloor at both its holiest and most profane.

Polemics can only go so far in instrumental dance music; divorced from the context of Moss' statements, you might never guess that this is an album about discontent. But then again, maybe you would. It's surly, anxious, turbulent stuff, with unruliness coded right into its DNA. “U R Not Dying U R Just Waking Up” airdrops us into battle, as a stern, thudding kick drum and martial hi-hats carve out a clearing for a fierce rhythmic and textural workout. The chords are soothingly emotive, the drums hot to the touch. One-bar loops pile up, a relentless juggernaut of ideas that peaks with a rascally, pitch-bent synth solo before fading out in mid-beat, anticlimactic to the core.

There is no resolution in these bruising, brooding tracks; just a never-ending tug-of-war between tension and release in which tension usually has the upper hand. That's not to say it's not satisfying: The pleasure principle hits with every lovingly sculpted kick drum, every psychoacoustic frequency. The spectrum is awash in sounds that prod and needle in ecstatically confounding ways. “The Secret Teachings of the Ages” is powered by a drone as primeval as tolling bells. “The Map of Salt & Stars” radiates desperate hope, every bar pushing upward; the drums, mixed low, are the consistency of a fogged mirror, leaving the Atlas-shouldered bassline to carry the beat. In “Awakening From the Daydreams,” someone seems to have hooked up jumper cables to a screen door. Brittle tritones go head to head; the intervals telegraph the feeling of an ice-cream headache. Then, halfway through, a new chord offers momentary relief, as though someone had opened a fire door and sent a cool breeze flowing through the club.

But such respites are rare. Moss' sounds are serrated, grinding, and they throw off sparks; jagged peaks rise where layers collide, like mountains from tectonic plates. Conflict is encoded into the music itself, as sequences go off piste, or off key, dissonance thickening in the gelatinous midrange. These are not songs that work toward cathartic resolution. Take “I'm in a Strange Loop,” one of the album's highlights. It starts simply enough—for Hieroglyphic Being, anyway—with phased cowbells and angry crickets, cosmic synth flourishes, and a lithe, insistent bassline. But as a jammy Hammond solo flares up, the track becomes a roller coaster of competing intensities. The tempo dramatically slows; the song becomes a spooky dirge—until, unexpectedly, the tempo rises again. People are angry, Moss says, but he's not here to placate us. This is not DJ-friendly music; it's a bloodletting.

Papo2oo4's discography sounds like an old DJ Whoo Kid tape unearthed inside the case for a NBA Street video game. Since the late 2010s, the New Jersey rapper has revisited a bygone era of East Coast mixtape rap that younger generations are more likely to encounter in a Dipset-themed Instagram moodboard than on DatPiff. Perhaps that's why Papaholic, Vol. 1 slid perfectly into an algorithm already serving me a steady drip of 2000s streetwear “newstalgia”—a marketing trend that seeks to put a fresh twist on nostalgic styles without alienating purists. One such drop, a newly minted Supreme tee featuring a photo of Harlem rapper Max B, appeared on a post by Hidden.NY soundtracked by Papaholic, Vol. 1 highlight “Counter Strike,” where Papo raps over a bouncy chipmunk soul beat like he earned his first Roc-A-Fella chain while wearing a pair of Dinosaur Jr. Dunks.

The blurriness of newstalgia, both a point of reference and discovery, makes Papaholic, Vol.1 a refreshing take on a brand of hip-hop revivalism previously explored by New Jersey rappers like Retch and reshaped by contemporaries across the Hudson such as Chelsea's YL. Arranged like an aughts-era DJ-hosted mixtape, Papaholic, Vol.1 pays its respects without aiming for a meticulous recreation in the manner of Joey Bada$$'s 1999. It's more akin to the work of East Coast experimentalists such as Ratking: breaking just enough rules to make old sounds radically new. Your brain might believe it heard nearly all of Papaholics, Vol.1 as a tween cruising to DJ Green Lantern's radio station in Grand Theft Auto IV—at least until Subjxct 5 breaks any traditionalist expectations by delivering head-knocking beats that could be heard in a From the Block performance today.

Trap-A-Holics and Evil Empire tags dress up the 24-track tape in Y2K aesthetics, but it's got none of the awkwardness of Timothée Chalamet in True Religion. “Pap need the dollas/I ain't vote for Trump or Kamala/My bitch wear Celine and the devil wear Prada,” Papo raps gruffly on opener “Beast Mode,” riffing on present-day politics with the same cheeky nihilism found on South Park in 2004. Papo shines when he raps about his love for 2000s Lil Wayne mixtapes and vintage Helmut Lang pickups over Subjxct 5 beats like “Chopper City” and “Sosua Beach” that spiritually channel aughts hitmakers like Timbaland, Just Blaze, and Swizz Beatz.

The dizzying array of projects Papo2oo4 and Subjxct 5 have released since 2017 could soundtrack an entire day of streetball at Rucker Park. Papaholics Vol.1 shapes up as one of their most distinctive plays yet by going outside of their comfort zone. Papo bars out over 808 drill slides on “Rap 4 Sale,” slides into “Kyrie at St. Pats” to explore flows that feel more indebted to the late Pop Smoke, and circles back to deliver his best 50 Cent impression on “By the Garden.” One of the most delightful detours crops up on “Triple Black” and “Plug World x Double O,” where Papo glides over tinny keys suitable for a contemporary Michigan rap record.

The 48-minute tape could be tighter; a few songs, like “Rlly Love” and “Shorty Goin,” suffer from weaker hooks and less ambitious beats. And while Papo always sounds revved up to rap like he's filming a Smack DVD freestyle, it sometimes feels like the bars on Papaholics, Vol.1 don't add up to anything more memorable than a few quotables. On the duo's older releases, such as 2023 PAP on P.E.D's standout “Onna Westside,” Papo's rhymes were more deft. Still, Papaholic, Vol. 1 stands out: It hits the same vein of hip-hop newstalgia that A$AP Rocky explored when he mixed Max B's Harlem swagger with Screwed Up Click revivalism on Live.Love.A$AP. The online appetite for hip-hop history has only grown since. Instead of copy-and-pasting like nostalgia-pilled Instagram farmers, Papo2oo4 and Subjxct 5 are bouncing off the aesthetic to create something familiar yet entirely new.

Listen to the new song below.

“When the idea of a deluxe edition with covers/collabs first came up the literal first thought I had was ‘I gotta get Lindsey to sing Two Legs,'” Amos said in a press statement. “I've loved Snail Mail ever since Water From Your Eyes had a chance to tour with them so it was a joy to hear Lindsey bless the song like this.”

Jordan added, “Within the last few years, following Nate's projects, I have come to the conclusion he is the best songwriter of our generation as well as a great guy. Getting to do vocals on this was such a treat because I got to listen to it over and over again.”

	“It was an idea that was replaying in my head,” she tells Rolling Stone over Zoom from her streaming setup at home. “This is me being loyal to myself as a little girl.”

	Following a live event in her native Monterrey, Mexico on Tuesday, where she officially launched her music career in front of hundreds of fans, the Latina gamer officially premieres the colorful video for her debut single “Pilates” with Rolling Stone.


	“The song is about empowering the girls. And it's very pink!” she says. “‘Pilates' is very pink, and I feel like it goes with the whole design of my world. I want it to put fans in the mood — even if you're having a bad day, I want it to pull you out of that. “


	In gaming, AriGameplays has built a devoted fanbase thanks to her Twitch streams with games such as Minecraft, Fortnite, Grand Theft Auto, and Overwatch. She ranks in the top 30 of most-followed Twitch streamers in the world, and leads the list of Spanish-speaking women on the platform.

	











	In her music, Bela doesn't take herself too seriously. The campy, pastel-toned music video for “Pilates” follows her as a doll living in a colorful tropic world as she sings about yachts and matcha lattes, dropping Spanglish refrains like “in my baddie era” along the way on the poppy track.


Rolling Stone recently spoke to Aria Bela about her music launch, Sabrina Carpenter's skin in Fortnite, and what's next for her:


How was it for you to decide to transition into music? Walk me through it. I was being loyal to myself as a little girl, who always liked to do shows, dance, sing. It's something that I've always liked, and music, after all, lives with me every day. It was another way to be able to connect more with my fans, because they can listen to me everywhere, in the car, wherever they want to be.

Do you think your fans are expecting music from you?I just released the teaser, and I put a little bit of everything in there for people to come up with ideas. There are a lot of people who think I'm going to release merch, do makeup, or start a Pilates studio. The people who guessed music are very excited.

	











How did you start making music? I've been taking classes for more than two years, because I really wanted to do things right. Then I met Mechi Pieretti on TikTok. She's an artist, she's a singer, and she's also a composer. And we connected so well. The truth is that it's been a really fun process. It made me feel really confident. I write with her. We've had a really great girl power, where we've made things work pretty well. I've been very involved in my musical process, in my songs, in my videos, in the concepts of my songs. And I think that when you listen to it, it makes a lot of sense. It's my world.


Tell me about “Pilates” and its video. What was the inspiration for it, and how did you come up with the concept?Well, I love Pilates, to start. I was lucky enough to participate in [amateur boxing event] La Velada del Año several years ago. And things changed from zero to 100 for me, to start exercising, because I didn't before. And when I finished boxing, I said, “What am I going to do now?” And that's when I met Pilates. It fascinated me. It's 40 minutes, where you feel good with yourself, where you work out for yourself. And I think that's exactly what the single is, empowering the girls. And it's very pink. Pilates is very pink, and I feel like it goes with the whole design of my world.

Obviously, making the transition from a streamer to creating music can bring a lot of questions. How do you plan to respond to those people?It definitely makes me nervous. Something new always makes me nervous. And obviously, I guess there's going to be a lot of expectations, a lot of comments. I imagine they'll be good and bad. But I have a lot of confidence in what I'm doing. I've done it with a lot of love. And I think it's actually good. When you believe in yourself, you just need people to join you, to like you, to share with you, to connect with you. And for people who don't watch AriGameplays, they can connect with Aria instead.

A post shared by ARIGAMEPLAYS 🍓 (@arigameplays)


On the music side, what inspires you? What artists and what kind of songs?Well, the truth is that I've always been a popera, a pop girl. I definitely look to make pop. I feel like we need more pop in Mexico. So I really like knowing that I'm going to get in there. Obviously, I love other genres. So a lot of my songs are a mix of various things with pop. But that's mainly it. I grew up with Belinda. And I love that she still makes music. I still love what she does. And also Kenia Os, who I know is doing very well right now.

	











What do you think of the artists who are doing the opposite of you? For example, Sabrina Carpenter released her skin on Fortnite. What do you think of the crossover between music and gamers?It's crazy. I love it. It's been several years since Travis Scott released his Fortnite skin. I thought it was really cool. At the end of the day, it's the best of both worlds. And that's really good. I like that singers are trying to transition to this gaming world, which is huge. And I hope they can receive me as well now.


Love that. What's your plan with the music?I'm working on a lot of music. I already have a lot of songs that are coming out. I think that in about two weeks, a month, you will be getting to know another song and then another song. I also have a lot of love for them, and I know that people are going to like them a lot. They are all very different, but at the end of the day, they are still in the same line of pop and Aria Bela.

How would you describe your personality and what's something people may not know about you?Whenever I have to describe myself, I get nervous. I would say that I'm very happy. I radiate a lot of energy. I'm going to repeat, pink. I'm a very pink person, and very sentimental. I hope that when people listen to my songs, they can feel what I'm trying to convey.


I saw you were at Coachella, right?Yes, I loved seeing Lady Gaga, I also liked Post Malone, the Mexican artists, too. I enjoyed Junior H, I saw a bit of everything, and I loved it. Coachella was a great festival; it was my second year there, and it's really nice to have all kinds of music, and all the fandoms, and communities of people who like different genres in one place, living and sharing. It's incredible.

	The new season of The Last of Us has been notable for several reasons, including the loss of a major character on Sunday night. But the earlier premiere episode featured an unexpected appearance by Friends star Jennifer Aniston via a People magazine from 2003. 


	Aniston responded to her unlikely cameo in an Instagram Story on Tuesday, writing, “Of all the things to survive the apocalypse 🤣.” 


	In the episode, written and directed by co-showrunner Craig Mazin, Ellie (Bella Ramsey) and Dina (Isabela Merced) discovered an abandoned store. Ellie falls into the basement, where she discovers the magazine. It's dated to 2003, which is the year in the story when the societal collapse began. The magazine is a “Best & Worst Dressed” issue that feature Aniston alongside Kate Hudson and Britney Spears. 


	The second season of The Last of Us premiered earlier this month on HBO. The most recent episode featured (spoiler) the brutal death of Pedro Pascal‘s Joel at the hand of Kaitlyn Dever's Abby. Like fans, Pascal is still coming to terms with his departure from the series.

	It's not like they said, ‘Hey, we kill you at the beginning of season two,'” Pascal said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. “But it was always an understanding that it would stay true to the source material in a specific way and that the, let's say, practical and exclusive obligation would be for season one. It was just a matter of how and when.”


	He added, “I'm in active denial. I realize this more and more as I get older, I find myself slipping into denial that anything is over. I know that I'm forever bonded to so many members of the experience and just have to see them under different circumstances, but never will under the circumstances of playing Joel on The Last of Us. And, no, I don't spend a lot of time thinking about it because it makes me sad.”

	Among the oil and gas executives and senior government officials from around the world at the major annual energy conference CERAWeek in Houston last month, one Donald Trump appointee cut an unassuming figure. He stayed at a modest $130/night hotel and was photographed in a gray open-collared shirt and a pair of well-worn tan shoes.


	Little attention has been paid to Thomas Hardy's appointment as acting director of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, or USTDA. It is one of the smallest of the federal agencies and where he has spent the past two decades. But as the much bigger and better-known U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has been gutted, Hardy has quietly been overseeing a reorientation of foreign assistance in Trump's vision for American energy dominance. 


	During the few days he spent in Texas, Hardy spoke at events alongside energy ministers from Turkey and Libya and met with major U.S. fossil fuel companies. He was invited to a cocktail reception hosted by the French oil giant TotalEnergies — the event would be “an opportunity to network with high level oil and gas industry representatives,” according to Hardy's briefing book for the conference, which was obtained by the nonprofit investigative group the Centre for Climate Reporting and Rolling Stone.

	











	As USAID projects designed to help poorer countries transition to cleaner forms of energy have been shuttered, a new brand of international assistance is emerging under Trump: one that benefits America's economic interests as well. That's no more apparent than at USTDA, which funds feasibility and planning studies for major infrastructure projects in emerging economies to spur U.S. jobs and exports. For the past four years, it has focused on clean energy. But now, Hardy's briefing book shows, it is looking to work “in lock step with U.S. industry” to push natural gas around the world. According to the agency, it has already had “tremendous interest.”


	The push could prove lucrative for the companies cashing in on America's gas boom, which have helped the U.S. become the world's biggest producer of fossil fuels and donated millions to reelect Trump. But critics worry that the president's plans to make the U.S. the world's gas station could come at a cost to both Americans and the climate. And for poorer countries who have limited funds for transitioning to cleaner forms of energy, committing to U.S. gas now means that the work of the Trump administration could be felt long after he has left the White House.

	“Trump claimed an ‘energy emergency' but now wants to send more of our energy overseas, which will raise prices for families here, at home,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, the Rhode Island Democrat who is ranking member of the Senate Environment Committee. “The reverse Robin Hood scheme of making Americans pay to enrich fossil fuel billionaires is Trump's modus operandi, and by shutting down more affordable, clean, domestic energy, he is putting us all on the fast track to climate and economic disaster.”


	Even before Trump took office, the U.S. fossil fuel industry was preparing for a huge expansion of its ability to ship gas overseas. Now, with the president vowing to unleash American energy, it has the full support of the government. 


	His Cabinet has extolled the virtues of the oil and gas that Trump has referred to as the “liquid gold under our feet,” as the administration has slashed environmental regulations and opened up federal lands for drilling. Trump has even suggested that countries could buy American-made liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as a way to close trade deficits and avoid steep tariffs. 


	Building on his campaign promise to “drill, baby, drill,” Trump and his Energy Secretary Chris Wright have begun granting new gas export authorizations, which were paused by Joe Biden early last year over fears of driving up prices for Americans and fuelling global warming. Wright, a fracking billionaire, has previously said that the country's abundance of fossil energy could help alleviate poverty around the world while describing concerns about climate change as a “mania.”

	Meanwhile, like many other parts of the U.S. government involved in foreign assistance, USTDA and its roughly 60 members of staff have been in limbo — its funds frozen and work under review. Over the past four years, its activity in the energy sector has focused on renewables and trying to clean up fossil fuels. In December, for instance, the agency announced a partnership with the Egyptian national oil company to help reduce emissions of the greenhouse gas methane. Other examples of initiatives supported by the agency under the Biden administration include a solar power project in Zambia and wind power in Indonesia.


	But the agency's work could look very different under Trump. On the day of his inauguration, USTDA published on its website five ‘success stories' about its work: All five were related to fossil fuels, and all five related to projects it had funded during Trump's first term. There have been no updates on the agency's website or social channels since, other than a post on X and LinkedIn on February 3 announcing that “All USTDA activities are suspended until further notice.” 

	











	But that didn't stop Hardy, who also served as acting director for three years during Trump's first term, from attending CERAWeek in March. He told Reuters on the sidelines of the conference that the agency was already shifting its focus: “Our approach is looking at all energy projects and not being hamstrung by only renewables as happened in the last four years,” he said. His briefing notes from the conference obtained via a FOIA request by CCR suggest that natural gas would be central to its efforts.


	His draft answers for a CERAWeek panel on the African energy sector referenced Trump's executive order on “unleashing American energy” signed on the first day of his second term. 


	“Areas of focus include options for reliable and affordable energy such as oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical minerals, and nuclear energy,” Hardy's notes state. “Of these areas, USTDA anticipates the greatest concentration of its energy sector efforts may be in critical minerals, nuclear energy, and natural gas.”


	As well as his public speaking commitments in Texas, Hardy met with major players in the U.S. gas industry, Cheniere and Excelerate Energy. A planned meeting with ExxonMobil did not go ahead, a spokesperson for the agency said. During the first Trump administration, all three companies participated in USTDA's so-called ‘reverse trade missions,' where the agency invites foreign governments and companies to meet with U.S. industry, according to Hardy's briefing book. 


	He also met with GE Vernova, which works in the renewable energy sector but is a major supplier of turbines for gas-fired power plants. His briefing notes stated that he would “share details about USTDA's planned programming in the energy sector under the Trump administration; and explore areas for collaboration.”


	“We have seen tremendous interest from our partners in emerging markets for support of their natural gas infrastructure,” a USTDA spokesperson told CCR and Rolling Stone. “It is through projects like LNG import terminals and gas-fired power plants that these countries will be able to provide reliable and affordable electricity to their citizens. USTDA is working to make sure that U.S. companies are well positioned to win export deals when emerging markets invest in their energy infrastructure.”


	The briefing book also shows how the first Trump administration had previously sought to use USTDA to specifically boost gas. A memo included in the bundle, titled “Putting American Workers First while Ensuring U.S. Energy Dominance Globally,” mentioned nine USTDA-funded gas projects in countries across the world, including Sierra Leone, India and Vietnam, from Trump's first term. 

	











	“During the Administration of President Donald J. Trump, USTDA prioritized an all-of-the-above energy strategy to open emerging markets for the export of U.S.-manufactured goods and services,” the memo stated. “Core to this focus was ensuring countries had the ability and capacity to import U.S.-produced LNG, making the United Sates [sic] an indispensable partner for energy production.” It added that “this commitment to energy development” led to over $1 billion in U.S. exports.


	His notes state that the agency plans to “coordinate with the U.S. gas industry to launch an updated version of this initiative so that we can address their current and longer-term needs.”


	Dr. Robert Howarth is a professor at Cornell University whose research informed the decision by the Biden administration to pause approvals of new LNG export licenses in January last year. He found that emissions may be much higher than previously expected. 


	“We need to be reducing our emissions from fossil fuels by half in the next 15 years or so if we're going to avoid catastrophic runaway climate disruption. But here we are exporting LNG which has the largest footprint,” he said.


	It would be “tragic” for the climate if countries such as Vietnam — where USTDA's work during Trump's first term helped “U.S. industry to supply technology for natural gas power plants,” according to Hardy's briefing book — build out LNG infrastructure because of pressure from the U.S., he said. “The world simply can't afford to increase our use of fossil fuels.”


	A spokesperson for USTDA did not directly answer questions about the potential impact the agency's work could have on the climate or whether it would continue to support renewable energy projects. The agency will “align its programming” with Trump's Executive Order on Unleashing American Energy but it is still under review, she said. “Any resumption of program funding will fully align with the Administration's foreign policy priorities for making America safer, stronger and more prosperous, including in the energy sector.”


	The vision for a second Trump term as written last year by the coalition of conservative groups known as Project 2025 included calls to “scale back USAID's global footprint” and “deradicalize” its programs. Of particular ire to the group was “the Biden Administration's extreme climate policies” and “its anti-fossil fuel agenda.”

	











	“The next conservative Administration should rescind all climate policies from its foreign aid programs,” it wrote in its Mandate for Leadership, the book published by the group.


	Despite distancing himself from Project 2025 during the campaign, Trump's gutting of USAID over recent months has largely followed this plan. More than 150 climate and clean energy contracts and grants managed by the agency have been terminated, according to an analysis by Politico's E&E News. 


	The moves will have likely been cause for concern for those at USTDA. Project 2025 wrote that Congress should “eliminate” the agency, stating that its “activities more properly belong to the private sector.”


	But a pivot to fossil fuels could show that USTDA is a valuable tool for an administration looking for a more transactional approach to international development. Its small team, which has staff in D.C. and in U.S. embassies across the world, can have a mighty impact: For every dollar it spends on programming, it generates on average $231 in U.S. exports.


	A memo apparently being circulated by Trump aides suggests USTDA could be placed under the auspices of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Politico reported last month. Rather than providing grants, DFC oﬀers loans, makes investments, and provides insurance against political risks for private sector-led projects in lower and middle-income countries. The proposed plan is part of a broader retooling of overseas aid to “create a performance-based, transactional model.”


	“This blueprint proposes a reimagined U.S. international assistance structure and set of operating principles that promises measurable returns to America while also projecting American soft power; enhancing our national security; and countering global competitors, including China,” the memo states. But there are questions about what the countries would get from U.S. aid focused on building out LNG import infrastructure and gas-fired power plants. 


	The industry has claimed that cheap, reliable LNG can be used as a transitional fuel for countries looking to move away from coal. But Sam Reynolds, a research lead at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said that for many countries, it does not make financial sense to import U.S. LNG, regardless of the consequences for the climate. He said that the cost of generating electricity from imported LNG is “orders of magnitude more expensive than renewables.”

	











	In many cases, “there simply is no economic case to use LNG as a bridge fuel,” he said.

	But he warned that pressure from the Trump administration on countries to buy U.S. gas could lead to “transactional LNG relationships rather than relationships based on sound economics. They're based on security and fear and a need to assuage the current administration.”

	The Tennessee Board of Parole has recommended a pardon for Jelly Roll — who has spoken openly about his criminal record and time served incarcerated — following a nearly two-hour hearing Tuesday in Nashville.


	The board voted unanimously to pardon the singer born Jason DeFord, with their recommendation sent to Governor Bill Lee, who must sign off on the pardon. “The reporting on Jelly Roll, that's encouraging for his situation, but there are steps yet to happen in that case,” Lee said (via The Associated Press).


	“This was incredible,” Jelly Roll said of the board's decision. “I pray this goes through. But today was special for me, regardless.”


	Jelly Roll, now 40 years old, spent time behind bars in his early 20s on drug and robbery charges. The singer has often talked about how his incarceration was a life-changing experience and inspired him to pursue music. Jelly Roll also frequently speaks to prisoners and juveniles, “teaching people how to recover the right way, through therapy and through music, through redemption and giving them real second chances,” as he told a Helping Addicts Recover Progressively program earlier this year.

	“I want to be an inspiration for people who are now where I used to be — to let them know that change is truly possible,” Jelly Roll told the board on Tuesday. “One of the reasons I'm asking for your recommendation for this pardon is because I'm looking to take my message of redemption through the power of music and faith, through the rest of the world.”

	Another reason Jelly Roll seeks a pardon: With his criminal record, touring internationally — while not impossible, as he recently embarked on his first tour of Canada — has been logistically difficult, telling the board that he requires “a team of lawyers and a mountain of paperwork to secure my entry into those countries.”


	Jelly Roll's parole process began in October 2024, which marked five years since his last sentence expired.

Carlos Santana postponed a concert in San Antonio, Texas, on Tuesday evening after suffering from dehydration, his manager Michael Vrionis said in a statement.


	The musician was scheduled to perform at the Majestic Theatre as part of his Oneness tour. “It is with profound disappointment that I have to inform you all that tonight's show in San Antonio has been postponed. Mr. Santana was at the venue (Majestic Theatre) preparing for tonight's show when he experienced an event that was determined to be dehydration,” said Vrionis. “Out of an abundance of caution and the health of Mr Santana, the decision to postpone the show was the most prudent course of action.” The manager assured fans that Santana is “doing well and is looking forward to coming back to San Antonio soon, as well as continuing his U.S. tour,” and promised that the show would be rescheduled soon.

	As Elon Musk shreds the federal workforce and threatens America's core safety-net, his buddy in the White House, Donald Trump, has been leading the American economy into a recession with his escalating trade war. Now, Musk and Tesla are feeling the financial burn — and the world's richest man is lashing out.


	During a call with investors Tuesday, Musk blamed “paid” and “very organized” protesters for his electric company's remarkably weak earnings so far in 2025. “They're obviously not going to admit that the reason that they're protesting is because they're receiving fraudulent money, or that they're the recipients of wasteful largesse, they're gonna come up with some other reason, but that is the real reason for the protests,” said the billionaire.


	Tesla's quarterly earnings plummeted by 71 percent compared to last year, the company reported Tuesday, as the electric vehicle company saw a 9 percent decline in revenue year over year. Its total earnings were down from $1.4 billion in the first quarter of last year to $409 million in the first quarter this year, the company stated. Tesla's income was offset by selling $595 million in zero-emissions tax credits, per its earnings report, which helped the company avoid a loss.

	











	“Uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers,” Tesla stated in an earnings presentation. “This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term.”


	The changing political sentiment, of course, has a lot to do with Musk's gleeful firing of tens of thousands of federal workers in the name of alleged cost savings made by his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), as well as his amplification of white nationalists on X — and the straight-armed salute he made during Trump's post-inauguration rally. Musk and DOGE have slashed the agency that manages Social Security, as he's falsely criticized America's core safety-net program as a “Ponzi scheme.”

	Musk, who poured $290 million into efforts to elect Trump and Republicans, has seen Tesla become a political lightning rod, with protestors taking out their frustrations over DOGE on his electric vehicle company. Trump, the man he helped elect, has launched a global economic trade war and refuses to let up on China, which has retaliated against his import taxes of 145 percent, countering with 125 percent. 

	











	During Tuesday's call, however, Musk continued to avoid taking responsibility for the political nightmare he created for his company. He instead touted DOGE's “progress in addressing waste and fraud,” and reiterated his commitment to “working together with President Trump and his administration, because if the ship of America goes down, you'll go down with it, including Tesla and everyone else.”


	Musk said that while he will begin scaling back from his work with the White House “probably in May,” he expects to continue working with the Trump administration for the remainder of the president's term. He added that he will begin spending more time on Tesla affairs starting next month.


	Tesla backlash is at an all-time high, whether acted on through bumper stickers and peaceful protests or torched vehicles and vandalized company facilities. As calls for boycotts against Tesla have spread across the globe, sales have plummeted across the board, and the company's latest product, the stainless steel-paneled Cybertruck, has been a flop.

	However, Musk ended his call on an optimistic note despite the public displeasure with his work alongside Trump and plunging Tesla profits. “I continue to believe that Tesla, with excellent execution, will be the most valuable company in the world,” said Musk. “By far.”


	“We're not on the ragged edge of death, not even close,” he added.

A 'flame in the sky,' eerie red glowing objects and swarms of UFOs over military bases are just some of the many sightings that have gravely concerned the US government.

There are dozens of unsolved cases going back to the 1960s that occurred over nuclear missile installations, Navy ships and a desert in New Mexico.

The FBI, CIA, and other government branches have spent years looking into these reports, but have yet to determine what the objects were and where they came from.

One report in 2019 detailed how 'drones' appeared over Colorado, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Kansas as locals reported spying a mothership hanging in the sky.

In just the last few months, the skies over New Jersey were filled with unidentified aircraft and drones that required a formal response from both the Biden and Trump presidencies.

Now, as the current administration weighs declassifying many of these UFO-related incidents, there could soon be new information about some of the key close encounters the government has taken extremely seriously over the years.

Swarms of small UFOs were tracked at dusk above Joint Base Langley-Eustis for at least 17 nights in December 2023.

Witnesses reported them 'moving at rapid speeds,' displaying 'flashing red, green, and white lights' and sounding like a fleet of lawn mowers.

These brazen penetrations over the base — home to at least half the Air Force's F-22 Raptor stealth fighter jets — led to two weeks of emergency White House meetings.

For at least 17 nights in December 2023, swarms of small 'drones' were seen penetrating the highly restricted airspace above Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. Above, a photo taken by an eyewitness of one (or more) of these drones as provided to the Wall Street Journal and others

Reports of mysterious 'drones' swept through eastern Colorado and nearby areas of Nebraska, Wyoming, and Kansas over the winter of 2019 into 2020.

The sightings were in close proximity to some of America's sensitive, nuclear-equipped intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).

'They all seem clustered in an area that has quite a few Minuteman sites,' an official confessed in one email. 

'We do not know the origin of the drones,' wrote another official at the base, which houses 150 Minuteman III ICBMs. The author then added the hashtag '#aliens.'

Witnesses reported that lights on these craft were sometimes 'flashing or steady white, red, or green.'

Staff at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming claimed they also saw a 'mothership' six feet in diameter flanked by 10 smaller drones (some fixed wing, some not).'

'When deputies follow the drones, they clock them at speeds of 60-70 mph,' the base official continued.

An internal January 8, 2020 email released by F.E. Warren's 90th Security Forces Group was adamant that drones are '100,000,000,000% not us.' 

'I've seen some articles pointing the finger as us [sic],' one member of the base stated, 'but I can definitely say this is not our team.'

An infrared image showed the three UAS off of the USS Paul Hamilton on July 17th, 2019. A 'swarm' of them hovered near the ship for several hours, in just one of the many occurrences Naval ships saw over the course of weeks 

Sailors on board a fleet of Navy warships sailing in the Pacific near San Diego witnessed their ships being swarmed by a host of UFOs from July 15 to 30 in 2019.

The incident went on for hours, with craft hovering and zipping around near the fleet with flashing multicolored lights.

Deputy Director for Naval Intelligence Scott Bray tried to dismiss the incidences, telling Congress in 2022 that he was 'reasonably confident' the objects were drones — but the solution raises its own national security concerns.

One senior source from a defense contractor told the Liberation Times that same year that these strange swarms, appeared to be 'much more advanced' than traditional drones.

This defense expert also noted that the crafts' behavior made little espionage sense. 

'Chinese drones intent on spying would not announce themselves with flashing lights,' the source noted.

There was a Hong Kong-flagged bulk carrier, the Bass Strait, which sailed past one of the US ships around the same time as one of these so-called 'drone swarm' incidents.

That led to the US Navy suspecting that the Bass Strait was an espionage front, 'likely using UAVs to conduct surveillance on US Naval Forces.'

All told, at least eight Navy warships off the coast of California faced these repeated aerial incursions by 'unmanned aerial system' (UAS) swarms. 

Between the summer of 2014 and March 2015, UFOs were spotted almost every day over the skies off the East Coast, in a case made famous by Navy infrared footage released in 2017.

Infrared cockpit-camera footage taken on a later sortie by the same U.S. Navy squadron reveals another immensely fast-flying object, this one spinning in mid-air and moving against a 120-knot wind, again accompanied by commentary from totally baffled airmen. 

The video showed one tiny white speck and one large, dark blob, which would later be known as 'Go Fast' and 'Gimbal.' 

Between the summer of 2014 and March 2015 these unexplained objects were spotted almost every day over the skies off the U.S. East Coast

These highly qualified Navy pilots, told superiors the objects seemingly defied the laws of physics.

About 30-40ft long and shaped like a Tic Tac mint, they had no wings or rotors — in fact, they had no discernible means of propulsion or flight — and, yet, they could hover in the sky, slow suddenly and accelerate almost instantaneously to hypersonic speeds of a mile a second. 

Radar showed they could fly as high as 80,000ft. One pilot compared their remarkable maneuverability to a ping-pong ball bouncing off a wall. The resulting G-force would crush any humans inside.

A near collision was recorded in an official mishap report, when, in late 2014, the pilot of a Super Hornet fighter jet almost hit one of them. The pilot said it looked like a sphere encasing a cube.

Some of these UFOs, looked like a 'dark gray cube inside of a clear sphere,' said Lt Ryan Graves, a pilot of ten years' service. 'These things would be there all day.'

Scientists at the top secret White Sands missile test range witnessed waves of orb-like UFOs and 'flying saucers' seemingly spying on their work in 2013/

The smaller, more orb-like UFOs appeared to be greatly interested in the White Sands team's current classified projects, perhaps aware of the site's long history with the WWII-era Manhattan Project that built America's first atomic bomb.

Witnesses said the 'orbs moved toward the test site, hovered over the device as if scanning it for intel, 'then zipped away ... over the heads of bewildered scientists.'

'Several times over a few days,' according to ex-Pentagon counterintelligence officer Luis Elizondo, scientists at the top secret White Sands missile test range - part of famous Los Alamos - witnessed waves of orb-like UFOs and classic 'flying saucers' spying on their work

Witnesses said the ' orbs moved toward the test site, hovered over the device as if scanning it for intel, 'then zipped away ... over the heads of bewildered scientists'

Witnesses to an infamous 2004 UFO incident reveal 'Tic-Tacs' spotted flying at incredible speeds by top Navy pilots off the California coast were also picked up on sonar speeding underwater.

On November 14 2004, Top Gun fighter pilot David Fravor was flying a training exercise off the coast of San Diego when he was re-routed to investigate a strange object spotted on radar by warships protecting his aircraft carrier the USS Nimitz. 

What he found was a roughly 40-foot white object with no windows or wings, shaped like a Tic-Tac, flitting about above the sea that was roiling below it, disturbed by something large submerged beneath the surface.

Commander Fravor told Congress in 2023 that as he circled the object, it turned to mirror his movements, then shot off past him at thousands of miles per hour.

It then stopped a second later at a secret pre-designated rendezvous point 60 miles away that only he and a handful of Navy staff on his ship were given ahead of their training exercise.

Japanese pilots flying over Alaska in 1986 radioed to air traffic control in shock over seeing three unidentified lighted objects keeping pace with their aircraft.

According to Captain Kenju Terauchi, his first officer and flight engineer saw a giant round UFO as big as an aircraft carrier and flashing multicolored lights.

The UFOs were releasing fire similar to that of jet engines and then formed a small circle of lights that transformed into a square. 

The FAA's then-division chief for accidents and investigations, John Callahan, investigated this case, pouring over radio communications, radar data, witness statements and more. 

Callahan briefed the Reagan White House on JAL1628's gigantic UFO sighting, in a meeting also attended by representatives from the FBI, CIA, and three people from President Reagan's scientific study team.

According to Captain Kenju Terauchi, his first officer and flight engineer they also saw a giant round UFO as big as an aircraft carrier with flashing multicolored lights. FAA's then-division chief for accidents and investigations, John Callahan, personally investigated this case

'One of the guys from the CIA,' Callahan recalled, 'they actually swore all these other guys into, 'This never took place. We never had this meeting, and this was never recorded.''

'I asked them at the time,' he continued, ''If there was something there and if it's not the [then in development] Stealth Bomber, then you know it's a UFO. And if it's a UFO, why wouldn't you want the people to know?''

'He said if they come out and told the American public that they ran into a UFO out there,' the senior FAA investigator said, 'it would cause panic across the country.'

At the height of the Cold War, a then 26-year-old US Air Force Lieutenant Salas was underground overseeing Malmstrom Air Force Base's nuclear equipped intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in Montana.

Above, a missile combat crew member at Salas' old post, Malmstrom Air Force Base, prepares to close a three-foot thick door inside a nuclear launch control center 70-feet underground

He claimed an eerie red glowing UFO above the base's front gate temporarily disabled 10 ICBMs on the night of March 24, 1967 — a case that has since brought Salas to Congress and to the offices of the Pentagon's new UFO-hunters at AARO.

'I offered to even go there on my own expense. I would be happy to fully brief any congressman, or anybody from DoD,' Salas told DailyMail.com in 2022.

A USAF Strategic Air Command document written for ICBM manufacturer Boeing and released via FOIA seems to confirm the event, saying: 'All ten missiles in Echo Flight at Malmstrom lost [strategic] alert within ten seconds of each other.' 

Strategic Air Command noted having a 'grave concern' about the case.

Socorro Police Department officer Lonnie Zamora was chasing a speeder in 1694 when he spotted what he later described as 'a flame in the sky' about a half-mile away accompanied by a loud 'roar.'

Zamora followed the 'bluish and sort of orange' flame in his patrol car, soon witnessing an egg-shaped white craft parked in the desert with 'two people in white coveralls' standing near the parked UFO. 

'One of these persons seemed to turn and look straight at my car and seemed startled,' Zamora told investigators, who collected physical evidence of burns and landing gear marks at the site. 

Despite the FBI, the CIA, and the Air Force having a go at the case, they confessed they came up empty handed.

The Vatican's secret archives have long been a magnet for mystery - and now, alien intrigue.

Sprawling across more than 50 miles of underground shelving, these heavily guarded documents have fueled wild speculation for centuries. 

But some researchers now believe the Holy See could be sitting on the biggest secret of all: proof of extraterrestrial life.

As outlandish as it sounds, recent testimony by former US intelligence insiders claim the Vatican and American government have worked together to investigate, cover up and, most shockingly, study, UFOs.

Following the death of Pope Francis at age 88 on Easter Monday, UFO investigator and filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee is calling on the next pontiff to come clean.

Lee, who has spent three decades studying the links between religion, history and alien phenomena, claims the Vatican may be harboring 'hundreds' of classified files on UFO sightings - some possibly dating back centuries. 

'If the Church is truly committed to spiritual truth and human enlightenment, then it must no longer suppress information that could fundamentally reshape our understanding of our place in the cosmos,' Lee said in a statement. 

He believes many divine encounters described in religious texts, including the Bible, could in fact be misinterpreted alien sightings. And he's not alone in that theory. 

One event Lee is desperate to reexamine is the infamous Third Secret of Fatima. 

In 1917, three young Portuguese shepherds claimed to have seen a glowing apparition in the sky. The children, and the Vatican, have always maintained it was the Virgin Mary.

But Lee argues otherwise.

'If you read their original descriptions, what they wrote down, it's actually like orbs of light in the sky,' he told the Daily Mail. 

'This was not the Virgin Mary,' he said previously. 'This was a non-human intelligence trying to communicate with us, and the Vatican knows it.' 

In 2000, the Church released what it claimed was the full text of the so-called Third Secret. But many experts, including Lee, remain unconvinced. 

'There are definitely secrets in the Vatican,' he insisted. 

Recent testimony by former US spies appears to back him up. 

David Grusch, a decorated Air Force officer-turned-UFO whistleblower, claimed in a 2023 interview that the Catholic Church has been aware of alien life for decades.

According to him, the Italian government recovered a crashed UFO during Mussolini's fascist regime, and the Vatican helped cover it up.

Grusch alleged that Pope Pius XII even 'backchanneled' details of the incident to American intelligence officials, who then swooped in and seized the craft. 

When asked point blank if he believed the Church knew about the existence of extraterrestrials, Grusch didn't hesitate. 'Certainly,' he said. 

As for what may be driving the Vatican to withhold its alleged knowledge of extraterrestrials from the public, Lee suspects it may stem from the Church's concerns about inciting panic, or that it could shake people's faith.

'Why should we believe in one God, one Christ, if there's other life out there?' He asked. But he believes it's only a matter of time until the Vatican has no choice but to reveal what it knows. 

Thanks to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and other highly advanced research instruments, scientists have already found signatures of life beyond Earth.

Most recently, astronomers used JWST to detect dimethyl sulfide molecules in the atmosphere of a planet known as K2-18b. 

On Earth, this chemical is almost exclusively produced by life forms like marine algae, leading the team to believe it could be a biosignature of alien life.

Lee expects that researchers will soon find evidence of intelligent extraterrestrials, perhaps even within the next few months, he said. 

Such a revelation would put increased pressure on the Vatican to make any records of UFO encounters public, he suggests. 

What's more, releasing this information is important to national security and public safety, he adds, as it's possible some of these flying objects weren't alien at all, rather advanced military technologies wielded by global powers. 

'What people are seeing in the sky, they could be genuine extraterrestrial UFOs, but there's also most likely going to be secret military technology years and years ahead of what we think they've got,' Lee said. 

'I think people in the UFO community need to be aware of that. It's not just little green men visiting, it's more complicated.'

Pope Francis' successor will be elected by the College of Cardinals, who are all men that were appointed by the Pope and are usually ordained bishops. 

The election process, or 'conclave,' typically begins after a 15-day mourning period following the Pope's death, and can last for weeks or months.

That's because the new Pope isn't elected until he has won at least 90 votes, which may take several rounds of voting. 

Lee is hopeful that the next person elected to the papacy will begin to disclose any information the Vatican may have about potential UFO and extraterrestrial sightings.

'I think the public deserves to know,' he said. 'We don't need to be protected from this information.'","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

'What people are seeing in the sky, they could be genuine extraterrestrial UFOs, but there's also most likely going to be secret military technology years and years ahead of what we think they've got,' Lee said. 

'I think people in the UFO community need to be aware of that. It's not just little green men visiting, it's more complicated.'

Pope Francis' successor will be elected by the College of Cardinals, who are all men that were appointed by the Pope and are usually ordained bishops. 

The election process, or 'conclave,' typically begins after a 15-day mourning period following the Pope's death, and can last for weeks or months.

That's because the new Pope isn't elected until he has won at least 90 votes, which may take several rounds of voting. 

Lee is hopeful that the next person elected to the papacy will begin to disclose any information the Vatican may have about potential UFO and extraterrestrial sightings.

In the vastness of space, new discoveries continually reshape our understanding of the universe. Among the most exciting recent finds is Enaiposha, a planet that defies traditional classification. Unveiled in research that pushes the boundaries of our knowledge, Enaiposha is a super-Venus located approximately 47 light-years from the Sun. Its unique characteristics challenge existing planetary categories, offering a glimpse into the diversity of planetary systems beyond our own. As scientists delve deeper into its mysteries, Enaiposha promises to illuminate the complex nature of exoplanetary atmospheres and the vast possibilities of the cosmos.

Enaiposha stands out due to its remarkable dimensions and atmospheric composition. With a radius 2.7 times greater than Earth and a mass 8.2 times that of our planet, Enaiposha occupies a unique position between super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. However, what truly distinguishes this planet is its thick atmosphere, primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, water, methane, and carbon dioxide. The atmospheric conditions suggest a high concentration of water vapor and vaporized metals, drawing comparisons to Venus, hence its moniker “super-Venus.”

The presence of carbon dioxide at levels akin to Venus adds to its intrigue, while the atmosphere's heavy metal content and reduced hydrogen levels pose intriguing questions about its formation. The upper layers, shrouded in haze and aerosols, complicate spectroscopic analysis, making it challenging to gather clear data. Yet, these conditions also offer a unique opportunity to study atmospheric phenomena that differ dramatically from those on Earth, expanding our understanding of planetary science.

Recent spectroscopic studies have unearthed molecular traces across various wavelengths, yet persistent haze poses a significant challenge by dimming the incoming light. The detection of carbon dioxide, although weak, required rigorous statistical analysis to confirm its presence. As Kazumasa Ohno from the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan points out, the initial CO2 signals were minimal, necessitating careful validation to ensure their authenticity.

Beyond carbon dioxide, indications of complex metals and methane in Enaiposha's atmosphere hint at a rich chemical composition. These discoveries provide crucial insights into the intricate atmospheric dynamics of such dense exoplanets. By analyzing these components, scientists gain a deeper understanding of the formation and evolution of planets with thick atmospheres, laying the groundwork for future explorations of similar celestial bodies.

The research team, led by Everett Schlawin from the University of Arizona and Kazumasa Ohno, emphasizes the importance of continued observation of Enaiposha. Advanced instruments and further measurements are essential to refine our knowledge of this fascinating planet. Understanding the evolution of thick atmospheres over time and exploring the potential transformation of sub-Neptunes under certain conditions remain key objectives for researchers.

Questions persist about the formation of droplets or complex clouds from the metals present in Enaiposha's atmosphere. Investigating these phenomena could significantly enhance our understanding of atmospheric evolution on other worlds. While Enaiposha may not be habitable due to its extreme conditions, it offers a unique opportunity to explore planetary atmospheres in diverse environments, potentially providing insights applicable to less hostile exoplanets.

The findings from the Enaiposha studies have been published in two separate articles in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, highlighting the planet's significant scientific value. By challenging traditional categories like mini-Neptunes, Enaiposha compels scientists to rethink existing models and encourages deeper explorations into the universe's mysteries. The data gathered from this exoplanet could pave the way for new theories and methodologies in the study of planetary atmospheres.

As researchers continue to unravel Enaiposha's secrets, the potential for groundbreaking discoveries remains vast. This exoplanet serves as a testament to the endless possibilities of space exploration and the ever-evolving nature of our understanding of the cosmos. With each new finding, we inch closer to a comprehensive knowledge of the universe's vast and varied worlds.

Enaiposha stands as a beacon of scientific curiosity and discovery, challenging our perceptions of planetary formation and evolution. As we continue to explore this super-Venus and its complex atmosphere, what new revelations might await us in the uncharted territories of space? The journey to uncover the universe's secrets has only just begun.

Wow, this is mind-blowing! Are we really not alone in the universe? 🤯

Where is the declaration of “definitive proof of alien life…”? The article even says it's probably not habitable. Are you letting AI write your headlines now?

Could Enaiposha's atmosphere support any form of life, even if it's microscopic?

I'm a bit skeptical. How can we be sure these observations are accurate?

Does this mean we're one step closer to finding intelligent life? 🚀

We finally know more about M. Night Shyamalan's mysterious new movie, which has a story from Shyamalan and The Notebook author Nicholas Sparks.

Jake Gyllenhaal and Phoebe Dynevor will star in the film with a screenplay from Shyamalan, while the book is penned by Sparks. Both share the same story but are being worked on independently.

""I'm excited to share the cover for the novel version of REMAIN, my upcoming collaboration with @NicholasSparks,"" Shyamalan wrote on Twitter. ""The book, written by Nicholas, will be available on 10/7/2025. More news on the film I'm writing and directing coming soon.""

A lengthy synopsis can be found on websites listing the book for pre-order. The story follows an architect from New York named Tate Donovan, who has lost his sister. Before her death, she revealed that she can see ghosts, but the logical Tate finds this difficult to believe.

While seeking a fresh start, though, Tate meets a young woman called Wren, who challenges his assumptions. ""Tate gradually discovers that below the surface of Wren's idyllic small-town life, hatred, jealousy and greed are festering, threatening their fragile relationship just as it begins to blossom,"" reads the synopsis. ""Tate realizes that in order to free Wren from an increasingly desperate fate, he will need to unearth the truth about her past before time runs out… a quest that will make him doubt whether we can ever believe the stories we tell about ourselves, and the laws that govern our existence. Love – while transformative – can sometimes be frightening.""

Shyamalan's most recent movie is Trap, which stars Josh Hartnett as a devoted father and sadistic serial killer.

Even though Stephen King has been crowned 'The Master of Horror' (alongside John Carpenter) over the past 50 years of successfully petrifying his readers, the legendary author isn't averse to being scared himself. Although it's certainly hard to imagine, especially given that the terrifying books IT and Salem's Lot were conjured from his mind, it seems as though there are quite a few films that keep him up at night, and one of them is a supernatural terror that brave Stephen King devotees can stream for free.

King is undoubtedly one of the planet's biggest horror writers, who has sold millions of books across every corner of the globe, and it's easy to see why. Not only does he capture the darkest parts of readers' imagination and bring them to life in a twisted puppet show, but the Maine native also offers a sense of escapism and nostalgia, while also blending terror with relatable human experiences. Naturally, many directors have flocked to King's writings to adapt many of his books, with some of the most recent being The Life of Chuck, Welcome to Derry, The Long Walk (written under Stephen King's pseudonym Richard Bachman), The Running Man, and countless others that include Carrie, which are in currently in development. For those who enjoy King's movie and TV show recommendations, one starring George C. Scott, Trish Van Devere, and Melvyn Douglas should be on your watch list. 

Stephen King's novels and short stories are some of the scariest stories out there, and the beloved author is praising a movie fans will want to see.

As reported by ComicBook, Stephen King previously revealed in an essay for the British Film Institute that The Changeling, a 1980 supernatural horror film directed by Peter Medak and starring George C. Scott, Trish Van Devere, and Melvyn Douglas, terrified the life out of him. King said that due to the simple yet creepy atmosphere of the movie, which didn't include any gory creatures or in-your-face scare factors, it was more than enough to keep him up at night. “For supernatural horror, I like Peter Medak's film The Changeling starring George C. Scott in perhaps his last great screen role,” King penned. “There are no monsters bursting from chests; just a child's ball bouncing down a flight of stairs was enough to scare the daylights out of me.”

For those wondering what the plot of The Changeling includes that scared King so much, it follows the story of John Russell, his wife, and daughter, who all head off on vacation, but before they get to their destination, their car gets stuck in snow. While calling for roadside help at a phone box, John's wife and daughter are tragically killed by an oncoming truck that smashes into the car. Grieving for their loss, he moves to an old mansion to get away from it all, but soon after moving in, John begins to experience unexplained and terrifying supernatural activities within the walls of the historic house. 

Previously, Stephen King said that his number one scariest film as an adult was watching George A. Romero's low-budget creation, Night of the Living Dead, while also mentioning that when he was 16 years old, Robert Wise's 1963 movie The Haunting was the scariest film at the time. However, it's not only movies that King has a soft spot for, as he loved From and Silo too, calling them both ""worth his time.""

As for where King fans can watch The Changeling and see what all the fuss is about, it is currently streaming on Tubi for free, Pluto TV, and The Roku Channel, plus Shudder and Peacock.

Based on Stephen King's bestselling novel, HBO's prequel series IT: Welcome to Derry receives its first official poster with new preview shots.

The Vatican's secret archives have long been a magnet for mystery - and now, alien intrigue.

Sprawling across more than 50 miles of underground shelving, these heavily guarded documents have fueled wild speculation for centuries. 

But some researchers now believe the Holy See could be sitting on the biggest secret of all: proof of extraterrestrial life.

As outlandish as it sounds, recent testimony by former US intelligence insiders claim the Vatican and American government have worked together to investigate, cover up and, most shockingly, study, UFOs.

Following the death of Pope Francis at age 88 on Easter Monday, UFO investigator and filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee is calling on the next pontiff to come clean.

Lee, who has spent three decades studying the links between religion, history and alien phenomena, claims the Vatican may be harboring 'hundreds' of classified files on UFO sightings - some possibly dating back centuries. 

'If the Church is truly committed to spiritual truth and human enlightenment, then it must no longer suppress information that could fundamentally reshape our understanding of our place in the cosmos,' Lee said in a statement. 

He believes many divine encounters described in religious texts, including the Bible, could in fact be misinterpreted alien sightings. And he's not alone in that theory. 

One event Lee is desperate to reexamine is the infamous Third Secret of Fatima. 

In 1917, three young Portuguese shepherds claimed to have seen a glowing apparition in the sky. The children, and the Vatican, have always maintained it was the Virgin Mary.

But Lee argues otherwise.

'If you read their original descriptions, what they wrote down, it's actually like orbs of light in the sky,' he told the Daily Mail. 

'This was not the Virgin Mary,' he said previously. 'This was a non-human intelligence trying to communicate with us, and the Vatican knows it.' 

In 2000, the Church released what it claimed was the full text of the so-called Third Secret. But many experts, including Lee, remain unconvinced. 

'There are definitely secrets in the Vatican,' he insisted. 

Recent testimony by former US spies appears to back him up. 

David Grusch, a decorated Air Force officer-turned-UFO whistleblower, claimed in a 2023 interview that the Catholic Church has been aware of alien life for decades.

According to him, the Italian government recovered a crashed UFO during Mussolini's fascist regime, and the Vatican helped cover it up.

Grusch alleged that Pope Pius XII even 'backchanneled' details of the incident to American intelligence officials, who then swooped in and seized the craft. 

When asked point blank if he believed the Church knew about the existence of extraterrestrials, Grusch didn't hesitate. 'Certainly,' he said. 

As for what may be driving the Vatican to withhold its alleged knowledge of extraterrestrials from the public, Lee suspects it may stem from the Church's concerns about inciting panic, or that it could shake people's faith.

'Why should we believe in one God, one Christ, if there's other life out there?' He asked. But he believes it's only a matter of time until the Vatican has no choice but to reveal what it knows. 

Thanks to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and other highly advanced research instruments, scientists have already found signatures of life beyond Earth.

Most recently, astronomers used JWST to detect dimethyl sulfide molecules in the atmosphere of a planet known as K2-18b. 

On Earth, this chemical is almost exclusively produced by life forms like marine algae, leading the team to believe it could be a biosignature of alien life.

Lee expects that researchers will soon find evidence of intelligent extraterrestrials, perhaps even within the next few months, he said. 

Such a revelation would put increased pressure on the Vatican to make any records of UFO encounters public, he suggests. 

What's more, releasing this information is important to national security and public safety, he adds, as it's possible some of these flying objects weren't alien at all, rather advanced military technologies wielded by global powers. 

'What people are seeing in the sky, they could be genuine extraterrestrial UFOs, but there's also most likely going to be secret military technology years and years ahead of what we think they've got,' Lee said. 

'I think people in the UFO community need to be aware of that. It's not just little green men visiting, it's more complicated.'

Pope Francis' successor will be elected by the College of Cardinals, who are all men that were appointed by the Pope and are usually ordained bishops. 

The election process, or 'conclave,' typically begins after a 15-day mourning period following the Pope's death, and can last for weeks or months.

That's because the new Pope isn't elected until he has won at least 90 votes, which may take several rounds of voting.

(Red Oak) -- The Wilson Performing Arts Center will be having Stacie Bannon, a Psychic Medium, on April 26th, starting at 7:30 PM.

Connecting people with loved ones who have passed, Bannon is a trusted Medium that has been helping people deal with grief and hardships in dealing with major losses in their life.

""I've been a Psychic Medium for about 12 years now.  I was raised in Omaha, and I always knew there was a little bit more to life.  Then when I moved to New York City when I was 18, I definitely figured out there was more to life than just meeting people and stuff.  12 years ago, I started doing readings for people, and that means people come to me with either questions that they want answers or guidance for or to connect them with departed loved ones, and I love it,"" said Bannon.

Attendees can expect the award winning Bannon to try to connect to people in the crowd with her approach in easing any suffering from losses they may be experiencing, and she will try and connect with the audience. 

""When they come and everybody gets seated, I do do like a little talk for about ten minutes just so people feel comfortable and also they know what to expect.  And so once that's, and to give them a little more idea about mediumship because I'm sure some people in the audience will just be coming with someone who asked them to come.  So I like people to know what to expect.  And then once I'm done with the brief introduction, then I literally will have family members that I will connect with for random audience members,"" said Bannon

Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) rebuked Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) on Tuesday evening for “peddling conspiracy theories” about the 9/11 attacks.

Johnson, in an interview this week with a conservative influencer, said he wants to hold additional hearings on the attack on the World Trade Center complex in New York City, after watching a documentary and speaking to others who doubt the government's probe into the attack that killed nearly 3,000 people, including hundreds of first responders.

“There are a host of questions that I will be asking, quite honestly, now that my eyes have been opened up,” Johnson said.

Lawler tore into the comments, calling them “crap.”

“Respectfully, Senator Johnson should stop peddling conspiracy theories about the worst terrorist attack in our nation's history and one that forever altered the lives of so many of my fellow New Yorkers,” Lawler wrote on the social platform X, resharing an article about Johnson's remarks.

“Crap like this dishonors and disrespects the innocent lives lost, our brave first responders, and all families and survivors who still carry the pain of 9/11 each and every day,” he added.

Johnson, who is in his third Senate term, chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.

He said in the interview early this week that “there's an awful lot of questions” surrounding 9/11 — particularly about the collapse of Building 7, which fell hours after hijackers crashed two commercial planes into the Twin Towers.

An investigation by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) concluded that Building 7 progressively collapsed from a prolonged fire that couldn't be extinguished due to water supply issues after the building sustained extensive damage. Experts have repeatedly debunked efforts to link Building 7's fall to a controlled demolition.

“It is the firefighters who have been leading the charge for over 20 years to have their legitimate questions answered,” Johnson said in a statement to The Hill Wednesday when asked about the pushback. “I am honoring them by responding to their concerns. I recommend that everyone watch the documentary ‘Calling Out Bravo-7' before criticizing those who are seeking the truth.”

Fifty years ago, April 21, 1975, was the day our family set foot in the United States, with green cards on hand.

I call it a personal liberation day, not because we left an oppressive country, but because the USA beckoned as a land of possibilities. And this country has been good to us.

Our family has thrived. And within about 10 years I would correct someone referring to Bangladesh as home. Instead, home has been variously Nashville, Tullahoma, Murfreesboro and now Manchester.

I would be less optimistic if I arrived today. And the main reason would be that far too many Americans today see conspiracies all around. Seeing conspiracies everywhere is so third world. Trust me. I came from one.

Regardless of political views, we need to agree on objective facts. As the late great Sen. Patrick Moynihan, D-New York, said, “We are entitled to our own opinions, but not our own facts.”

Low information, high opinion today gets the acclaim it does not deserve.

A technologically advanced country like the United States cannot sustain its lead if too many Americans believe as fact what feels comforting, and dismiss inconvenient information as fake news. We are not North Korea where after decades of information manipulation, people there giggle or weep on cue. That is what happens when people are assigned opinions, or become gullible.

For truth to set us free, we must not believe in distorted truths. The rest will follow to keep the USA the greatest country on earth.

Scientists on an expedition to the South Sandwich Islands near Antarctica have recorded horrifying videos of parasitic copepods feasting on the head of a deep sea rattail fish.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Shocking new footage shows a pair of bloodsucking parasites latched onto the head of a deep-sea rattail fish.

In the video, which the Schmidt Ocean Institute shared in a Facebook post, two copepods — small crustaceans — are positioned on either side of their host's head. Long egg sacs attached at the back of the parasites make it look like the fish is sporting a pair of pig tails.

""They feed on blood and fluids from their host using their scraping mouth parts that are embedded in the muscle of the fish,"" James Bernot, an evolutionary biologist at Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History who was not on the expedition, told Live Science in an email.

Scientists captured the footage at a depth of 1,604 feet (489 meters) during an expedition to examine the seafloor and biodiversity of the South Sandwich Islands, a chain of 11 subantarctic volcanic islets in the South Atlantic Ocean.

The copepods are a species called Lophoura szidati, and are latched onto the head of a rattail fish from the genus Macrourus, representatives wrote in the Facebook post.

Macrourus are commonly known as grenadiers or rattails because of their large heads and slender tails. These widespread deep-sea fish occupy the cold waters of the North and South Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Southern Ocean that borders Antarctic waters, and can be found at depths from 1,312 to 10,450 feet (400 to 3,185 m).

Knowledge of deep-sea fish parasites in Antarctic waters is scarce, but L. szidati, is one of the most common parasites found on Macrourus species in this region.

L. szidati is part of the family Sphyriidae. Females of this species have been observed using their mouth parts to bore into the bodies of various fish and feed on their host's muscle tissue.

""These copepods are mesoparasites, meaning they are partly inside and partly outside of their host,"" Bernot said, adding that in the video the middle and back end of the copepods stick out of the fish, while the anterior, or head-end of their body is embedded in the fish.

Many copepod parasites have multiple stages in their life cycle and typically find their hosts while in their larval stage. These tiny larvae bury themselves within the host's skin and begin feeding. During this time they metamorphose and develop anterior holdfasts that serve as anchors to keep them attached to their hosts as they grow.

In the video, each parasite carries a pair of sacs containing hundreds of eggs. ""Copepods are surprisingly good mothers for invertebrates,"" Bernot said. ""They carry their eggs in sacs attached to their body until the eggs hatch into swimming nauplius larvae that will molt through several larval stages and eventually go on to find their own host.""

Very little is known about the life cycle and lifespan of these parasites, but they are permanent fixtures to the fish and likely live for several months as they grow from a near microscopic size, Bernot said.

""Even after the parasite dies, remnants of the embedded head can still be found in their host for many years,"" Bernot noted.

Scientists have developed the world's first operating system designed for quantum computers, which could let quantum computers connect with each other, thereby paving the way for a quantum internet.

An operating system, such as Microsoft Windows or Apple iOS, is the program responsible for managing every other application on a computer. However, most quantum computers are designed and built for a specific function; for example, to run an experiment or simulation.

This limits the potential functionality of quantum computers and hampers their connectivity. There are also different types of quantum computers that use different kinds of quantum bits (qubits) to achieve quantum superposition in different ways.

But on March 12, scientists published a new study in Nature describing QNodeOS, an operating system for quantum computers that works with all kinds of machines irrespective of the type of qubits they use.

Such an operating system would enable multiple quantum computers to be connected together and controlled by the same central platform.

QNodeOS operates by combining a classical network processing unit (CNPU), which is the logical element for initiating the execution of the code, with a quantum network processing unit (QNPU), which controls the quantum code.

Together, the CNPU and QNPU form the QNodeOS, which controls a separate quantum device, called the QDevice.

The QDevice is quantum hardware-dependent technology responsible for executing quantum operations (gates, measurements and entanglements). There would need to be a QDevice for every quantum computer that the QNodeOS is required to operate.

A key component of the QNodeOS is the QDriver, which connects the QNodeOS to the QDevice. The QDriver is the only part of the QNodeOS that is quantum hardware-dependent. It translates the platform-independent quantum operations from QNodeOS into platform-dependent instructions and vice versa, thus enabling the QNodeOS to control different types of quantum computers. Executing a process also requires NetQASM — a universal, platform-independent instruction set architecture for quantum internet applications.

The scientists demonstrated the QNodeOS by connecting different quantum computers together (two made from processed diamonds with nitrogen vacancy centers and another made from electrically changed atoms) and running a test program, in a similar way to how a classical computer performs a calculation using cloud computing.

—Bizarre device uses 'blind quantum computing' to let you access quantum computers from home

—Scientists discover simpler way to achieve Einstein's 'spooky action at a distance' thanks to AI breakthrough — bringing quantum internet closer to reality

Further experimentation with the QNodeOS is required, like using more quantum computers of different types, as well as increasing the distance between them, the researchers noted in the study. The study highlighted that the architecture could be improved by having the CNPU and QNPU on a single system board, to avoid millisecond delays in their communication, rather than relying on two separate boards.

An operating system for quantum computers represents a major step forward in their development. One of the potential applications for a quantum computer operating system is for distributed quantum computing, as well as potentially laying the foundations for a quantum internet.

It's tempting to see ourselves as damaged or powerless—defined by past traumas, overwhelming emotions, and daily struggles. But is that really the most helpful way to understand ourselves? Does seeing ourselves as victims lead to growth?

Psychologist and author Scott Barry Kaufman joins us to examine how popular narratives around sensitivity, self-esteem, and emotional regulation may be holding us back. He unpacks the psychological costs of coddling (vs. empowerment), the rise of risk aversion, and how modern parenting, education, and therapy shape our sense of self.

With insight, empathy, and humor, Kaufman offers a timely look at what it really takes to build resilience, choose meaning over comfort, and unlock the full potential of the human spirit.

Scott Barry Kaufman is a cognitive psychologist who is among the top 1% most cited scientists in the world for his groundbreaking research on intelligence, creativity, and human potential. He is the host of The Psychology Podcast, which has received more than 30 million downloads and is frequently ranked the #1 psychology podcast in the world. His new book is Rise Above: Overcome a Victim Mindset, Empower Yourself, and Realize Your Full Potential.

Follow:


            President Donald Trump slammed Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday for his comments that Ukraine wouldn't recognize Russian control of Crimea, calling the remarks “very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia.”
    


            “It's inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy's that makes it so difficult to settle this War. He has nothing to boast about! The situation for Ukraine is dire — He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country,” he posted on Truth Social.
    


            His comments came a few hours after a meeting in London aimed at bringing about an end to Russia's war in Ukraine had been downgraded after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he wouldn't attend.
    


            Rubio had been expected to take part in the discussions with Ukrainian, UK and European officials, but State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Tuesday that he would no longer attend due to “logistical issues,” though a US official and two European diplomats familiar with the matter said the top US diplomat didn't go because the administration did not feel that they were at a decisive point in the ongoing talks and Rubio didn't feel attending would be the best use of his time.
    


            “It was better to let talks play out than create the illusion that a breakthrough was imminent,” said one of the European diplomats.
    


            Britain's Foreign Office confirmed on Wednesday that the meeting would take place at a lower level. “Official level talks will continue but these are closed to media,” the department said in a message to journalists.
    


            The developments throw new uncertainty over the diplomatic efforts to end Russia's war. The United States has become increasingly steadfast in its push to force Kyiv to an agreement, but Ukraine is adamant that it will not give up Crimea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014, or parts of eastern Ukraine that were captured following Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022.
    


            US Vice President JD Vance threatened to abandon negotiations on Wednesday, telling reporters during a visit to India: “We've issued a very explicit proposal to both the Russians and Ukrainians, and it's time for them to either say yes or for the US to walk away from this process. We've engaged in an extraordinary amount of diplomacy, of on the ground work.”

            But Ukraine's European allies, particularly Britain and France, have been hoping to bridge the divide. Wednesday's talks were due to follow a meeting in Paris last week in which officials from the US, the United Kingdom, France and Germany discussed the American framework for a ceasefire.
    


            After Rubio reversed plans to attend the latest talks, Bruce said President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, would represent the US in London instead.
    


            Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Russia on Friday, a US official said.
    


            The US proposal that has caused deadlock includes recognizing Russia's control of Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula illegally annexed by Moscow, an official familiar with the framework told CNN. It would also put a ceasefire in place along the front lines of the war, the official said.
    


            Any move to recognize Russia's control of Crimea would reverse a decade of US policy.
    


            Zelensky made clear Tuesday that he was open to talks with Russia, but that Kyiv would not accept a deal that recognizes Moscow's control of Crimea.
    


            “Ukraine will not legally recognize the occupation of Crimea,” he told reporters. “There is nothing to talk about. It is against our constitution.”
    


            Asked to clarify about whether he meant the US wanted to freeze the territorial lines where they are, Vance said Wednesday, “No, I didn't say that. What I said is the current line, somewhere close to them is where you're ultimately, I think, going to draw the new lines in the conflict. Now of course, that means the Ukrainians and the Russians are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own. There's gonna have to be some territorial swaps.”
    


            Meanwhile, the war has resumed with full force this week, following a surprise ceasefire over the Easter weekend that both sides accused each other of breaching.
    


            On Wednesday, Ukrainian authorities said nine people were killed and at least 30 wounded when a Russian drone struck a bus carrying people to work near the city of Marhanets in the Dnipropetrovsk region.
    


            Russia's National Guard said it destroyed 17 Ukrainian attack drones overnight, state-run news agency Tass reported on Wednesday.
    


            The talks in London were scheduled as US officials publicly voiced frustration over the lack of progress at bringing an end to the war.
    


            Trump has said he would “have to see an enthusiasm to want to end it” from both sides for the US to continue negotiations, after Rubio warned last week that Washington could walk away from its efforts to end the conflict if there were no signs of progress.
    


            The broad framework has been presented to both sides, Rubio and the State Department have said, to determine whether the differences can be narrowed in a short timeframe. There are still pieces of the framework to be filled out and the US plans to work with the Europeans and the Ukrainians on that this week, the official told CNN.

            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday the negotiations were “hopefully moving in the right direction,” and declined to say what “stepping back” from the peace efforts might look like for the US.
    


            Moscow has previously stalled on ceasefire negotiations and rejected an earlier US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire agreed to by Kyiv.
    


            However, under pressure from Trump, Ukraine and Russia have expressed willingness to negotiate for the first time in years; the two sides have not held direct talks since the early weeks of Moscow's invasion in 2022.
    


            On Monday, Putin raised the prospect of holding direct talks with Ukraine about a ceasefire that would halt striking civilian targets, but said further discussion was needed on how to define a civilian target.
    


            Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later confirmed the Russian president's remarks, saying “(Putin) had in mind negotiations and discussions with the Ukrainian side,” Reuters reported, citing Russia's Interfax news agency.

“This message will serve as your only warning,” stated a memo from Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer's chief of staff.

This story was originally published by ProPublica.


A top official in the Department of Labor this week informed all staff members that they could face criminal charges if they speak to journalists, former employees or others about agency business.

A memo sent Monday by Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer's chief of staff, Jihun Han, and obtained by ProPublica, states that “individuals who disclose confidential information or engage in unauthorized communications with the media may face serious legal consequences.”

Among the ramifications, the memo states, are “potential criminal penalties, depending on the nature of the information and the applicable laws,” and “immediate disciplinary actions, up to and including termination.”

The guidance document went on to say that “any unauthorized communication with the media,” regardless of what information is shared or how it is shared, “will be treated as a serious offense.”

The memo listed laws, regulations and a departmental guide to explain its legal position. Among them was a regulation concerning civil servants' ethical obligations and a law, the Freedom of Information Act, guaranteeing the public the right to inspect certain public records.

“This message will serve as your only warning,” the memo stated.

The warning comes as current and former Labor Department employees have spoken to the news media about harms they see resulting from the dismantling of portions of their agency, which enforces laws guaranteeing rights to a safe workplace, fair pay and protections against discrimination.

“It's very chilling,” a Labor Department employee who requested anonymity for fear of retribution told ProPublica. “It's never a good look when you're telling people to never talk about what you're doing.”

Labor Department spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“These types of missives can chill the free flow of information to the press and the public,” said Gabe Rottman, vice president of policy at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. “That's a concern.”

Civil servants do not sacrifice their First Amendment rights by accepting a job with the federal government, but there do exist higher restrictions on what information they can disclose publicly. Government agencies that handle classified information have on rare occasions launched criminal investigations against leakers, but those are typically invoked only when leaks involve classified national security intelligence or protected financial information, Rottman said.

“But normally, disclosures to the press or others would be a matter of employee discipline as opposed to carrying criminal sanctions,” he said.

While the memo raising the possibility of criminal penalties was sent to Labor Department employees, it reflects a common approach by the administration of President Donald Trump to guard against federal government employees speaking to reporters.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, for example, has publicly announced an aggressive pursuit of leakers. Elon Musk, who launched the Department of Government Efficiency, which is at the heart of the shake-up of the federal government, has bragged about his tactics in rooting out leaks at his companies. And Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has blamed alleged leaks by former Pentagon staffers for reigniting controversy over his use of the Signal messaging app to discuss military operations.

Federal employees at various agencies told ProPublica that an air of suspicion has descended on their workplace during Trump's second term, with rumors flying of surveillance of rank-and-file government workers. In the Department of Agriculture, for example, a banner temporarily appeared on government computers when employees logged in, telling them that “unauthorized or improper use of this system may result in disciplinary action, as well as civil and criminal penalties.”

Agriculture Department spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Labor Department employee told ProPublica that Monday's memo felt like the latest attack on a workforce already weathering layoffs, spending freezes and reorganizations.

“It's been horrible. It's been a deeply exhausting roller coaster,” the employee said. “It's very difficult to work when you're in a constant state of being terrorized by your employer.”



We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups.

            Fresh warthog carcass in tow, a poacher speeds away from Zimbabwe's Imire Rhino and Wildlife Conservancy. Blood spatters, footprints and tire marks are the only traces of the crime he has just committed, but a trace is all it takes for the hunter to become the hunted.
    


            His arrest comes a short while later, courtesy of Shinga, a Belgian Malinois that perfectly retraced the poacher's 2.8-mile (4.5-kilometer) route home, leading an anti-poaching team to his door.
    


            Last October's pursuit ultimately began much further afield, in the sleepy Welsh town of Carmarthen, where Shinga was born and raised. It's home to the kennels of Dogs4Wildlife, a non-profit organization that trains dogs to support anti-poaching units (APUs) in their efforts to protect endangered wildlife across southern Africa.
    


            It's run by professional dog trainers Darren Priddle and Jacqui Law, who decided to blend their career experiences of developing working dogs for police, security, and military operations with their love of wildlife, after seeing photos of a poached African rhino on social media in 2015.
    


            “It was quite a horrific image. We sat down and we said, ‘Okay, that's really affected us,'” Priddle told CNN.
    


            “We can deploy dogs in the UK to track people … to look for drugs, firearms and explosives, so why could we not look at developing the dogs that we were training for conservation efforts?”
    


            The duo has since sent 15 dogs to five sub-Saharan African countries, including Mozambique and Tanzania, each one bred by them in southwest Wales.
    


            They usually breed one or two litters each year. Dutch shepherds and Belgian Malinois are two of the most common breeds for tracking, while labradors and spaniels are typically the detection (sniffer) dogs of choice.
    


            Training begins from as early as two days old. Priddle acknowledges that sounds young, but he believes early imprinting programs can provide a strong foundation for the formal training that commences around six weeks later.
    


            “There's a lot of scientific study out there that's been documented on exposing puppies to touch, different temperatures, different surfaces and textures, as well as different odors that we put into the whelping box when they're very young,” he explained
    


            “It just helps their brain and (helps) their synapses to fire. We see a lot of advancement in those puppies.”
    


            The curriculum closely follows that of the typical police or security dog, focusing on obedience, tracking, and scent detection – a skill used to sniff out rhino horn, elephant ivory and bushmeat.
    


            The only key difference to the training process is acclimating dogs to the sights, sounds and smells of lions, giraffes and the myriad other species they will help protect. With rhino and elephant numbers severely lacking in the wetlands of Carmarthenshire, trips to local zoos are organized to desensitize the puppies to African wildlife.
    


            Typically, after 16 to 18 months, dogs are ready for assignment. Even though Priddle accompanies each one on the long flight to their new home, spending the first month with the anti-poaching unit to provide field and animal welfare training to rangers, goodbyes never get easier.
    


            “The transition from spending every waking moment with that dog, having a very strong relationship, to then letting that go is challenging and difficult,” Law said.
    


            “But as much as it breaks my heart when they go, I know they're going for the greater good.”
    


            Easing the pain are WhatsApp group chats set up for Priddle and Law to keep in touch with and advise APUs across the various reserves and conservancies.
    


            They are particularly active forums, especially given that the organization also provides training and consultancy to teams with existing dog units, such as the Akashinga Rangers, Africa's first armed all-female anti-poaching squad, who watch over Zimbabwe's vast Phundundu Wildlife Area.
    


            Naturally, updates of success are a source of immense personal pride for the pair back in Wales. Shinga's tracking triumph in October followed the achievements of fellow Belgian Malinois Dan, which in 2013 alerted his team to a rhino calf that had been caught in a snare trap in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa.
    


            Such victories demonstrate the “game-changing” value such dogs can have when incorporated into conservation efforts, argue the duo, even through their mere presence.
    


            “When these reserves bring a specialist dog onto a wildlife reserve … the word spreads very quickly that the APUs now have the capability to actually catch these poachers on a more efficient and successful basis,” Priddle said.
    


            “Some of the smaller wildlife reserves almost eradicate poaching in all types completely, just because of the deterrent value that dog brings to the party.”
    


            As park manager and head of anti-poaching operations at Zimbabwe's 10,000-acre Imire conservancy, Reilly Travers has had a front row seat for the last seven years to the impact of Shinga and also Murwi, a Dutch shepherd whose training was paid for by the fundraising efforts of pupils of the local Harare International school.
    


            Capable of covering as much as 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) an hour when tracking, even in darkness, dogs allow rangers to “own the night,” Travers explained, adding an invaluable level of versatility and unpredictability to their arsenal.
    


            And on numerous occasions Shinga and Murwi have alerted units to potentially mortal threats – be it from poachers or predators – through body language alone.
    


            “They've saved our guys on the ground on several occasions and they've been responsible for apprehending quite a few poachers,” Travers told CNN.
    


            “It's had a massive impact on security for Imire. We've had a drastic reduction in poaching and the K9 unit has a massive role to play in that … It's not the silver bullet but it's a tool that will make a significant difference.”
    


            Zimbabwe once boasted thousands of rhinos, yet numbers nosedived to less than 450 by 1992 because of poaching networks, according to conservation charity Save the Rhino.



            The efforts of Imire, which saw the birth of its 23rd rhino in 2023, helped the country's rhino population climb back over the 1,000-mark in 2022, but statistics continue to make for grim reading across the wider continent.
    


            Though the numbers of African rhinos poached annually has dropped steadily since a peak of over 1,300 in 2015, almost 600 kills were still recorded last year, according to Save the Rhino. It contributed to an overall decline in the total African black rhino population in 2023, though white rhino numbers are on the rise.
    


            And the impact of each loss extends far beyond statistics, Priddle and Law explain, especially at the smaller reserves that Dogs4Wildlife focuses on, which have markedly less anti-poaching resources than the continent's most renowned parks.

            Recalling the sight of a de-horned 25-year-old bull rhino and eight-year-old male in Limpopo, both killed by a single poacher, Law stressed the knock-on effect on the wider environment.
    


            “The vegetation they clear, the seeds they disperse, all the other animals that are impacted. You think it's just a rhino that's gone – it's the whole ecosystem that suffers,” Law explained.
    


            “The owners of that reserve had a relationship with that bull for 25 years – we grieve when we lose a dog after 10 to 15 years. For us to experience the impact that losing those two rhinos had on the reserve owner sort of gave us added motivation.
    


            “It was just horrific. I never want to see that again.”
    


            As Dogs4Wildlife looks ahead to its long-term goal of one day opening a specialized training and canine school within Africa, mobilizing future generations has become a key part of its overall mission.
    


            Its Conservation club, called Siyafunda Ngemvelo – which translates to “we learn in nature” in IsiZulu – has taken more than 180 South African children into reserves as part of a wildlife education program.
    


            Law said that for local people to want to protect rhinos, they must first see the animals' value to the environment.
    


            “We have to start at the fundamental basics, which is children taking responsibility for their own wildlife,” she added.
    


            “Once they get the passion for it, they're going to become future rangers, not future poachers.”

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has called for an immediate halt to government purchases of Covid-19 vaccines, citing a recent report that found mRNA jabs contain extremely high levels of DNA and substances that were not disclosed by the manufacturer.

Bratislava initially considered outright banning the vaccines when a commission led by Peter Kotlar, an orthopedic doctor and member of the ruling Slovak National Party, published a report in October claiming that the mRNA jabs alter human DNA, have been inadequately tested, and therefore should not be administered until they are proven safe. 

Kotlar has also described the Covid-19 pandemic as an “act of bioterrorism” and a “fabricated operation,” and has accused vaccine manufacturers Moderna and Pfizer of turning vaccinated people into “genetically modified organisms.”

His report, however, was met with significant pushback from opposition parties, as well as former Slovak Health Minister Zuzana Dolinkova, who cast doubt on Kotlar's qualifications with regard to the subject. She subsequently resigned from her position that same month, citing government backing for an anti-vaxxer and insufficient prioritization of health care.

In a post on X on Wednesday, Fico published a video in which he stated that ignoring the findings of the Kotlar-led commission on the quality of the Covid-19 vaccines would be “extremely irresponsible.”

Fico noted that in March, he instructed the Health Ministry to establish a working group to address the findings of the expert report submitted by Kotlar, but acknowledged that this may not produce results quickly enough.

The prime minister said he would try to resolve the issue in “a reasonable timeframe” and propose during an upcoming government meeting that apart from the working group, the Slovak Academy of Sciences (SAV) would also be asked to conduct a quantitative analysis of the presence of DNA and other substances in the vaccines.

Fico also suggested that the government should inform the population about the “serious findings” regarding the jabs. “Although Covid-19 vaccination rates are extremely low, people deserve such a warning,” he said.  

The prime minister went on to propose that Slovakia suspend the purchase of additional vaccines from the unspecified manufacturer, which it is obligated to do under a contract signed by the former government in 2023.

Bratislava is still expected to procure nearly 300,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines in 2025 and 2026, which is estimated to cost around $6.6 million, Fico said, stressing that “until the results of the additional quantitative analysis are delivered, the government should not procure further vaccines from this manufacturer or pay for them.”

PARIS, April 23. /TASS/. The withdrawal of the Ukrainian military from the territories of Russia's constituent regions of Donbass and Novorossiya is necessary to establish peace in Ukraine, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told France's Le Point in the interview.

""If Ukraine withdraws its troops from these four regions, then yes,"" he said when asked by the magazine's correspondent whether the conflict would end if this condition was met.

The Kremlin spokesman recalled that these regions are enshrined in the Russian Constitution as an integral part of it. He also noted that at the moment some territories of these regions are still occupied by the Kiev regime. ""According to the results of the referendums, these territories have entered the administrative borders of Russia.

Fossil teeth show species of protemnodon that roamed Australia between 5m and 40,000 years ago lived and died near Queensland caves

Despite their immense size, species of prehistoric giant kangaroos from a site in Queensland were probably homebodies with a surprisingly small range compared to other kangaroos, according to new Australian research.

Protemnodon, which roamed the Australian continent between 5m and 40,000 years ago and is now extinct, was significantly larger than its modern relatives. Some species weighed up to 170kg, making them more than twice as heavy as the largest red kangaroo.

Given their size, researchers expected they might have an expansive territory, said University of Wollongong palaeo-ecologist Chris Laurikainen Gaete, the co-author of the study published in PLOS One.

That's because in most modern plant-eating mammals, including kangaroos and other macropods, larger body size correlated with geographic range, he said. A small marsupial such as the pademelon, for example, occupies an area smaller than a kilometre squared, whereas the red kangaroo – the largest of all kinds – in outback Australia can hop long distances, sometimes further than 20km.

But analysis of fossil teeth found near Mt Etna, 30km north of Rockhampton in Queensland, revealed something quite different. These protemnodon kept to close quarters, living and dying near the caves where their remains were found.

Co-author Dr Scott Hocknull, a vertebrate palaeontologist and senior curator at the Queensland Museum, said the individuals from Mt Etna seemed to be “real homebodies” that stayed within “a tiny pocket” in and around the limestone caves.

“These gigantic kangaroos were just chilling at home, eating the rainforest leaves, because there were heaps of them around. That also means that the environment was quite stable. It meant that over hundreds of thousands of years, these animals decided that staying put was a good bet.”

The population at Mt Etna was “probably quite happy” for some time, Hocknull said. The rainforest probably provided a reliable source of food, while the caves offered protection from prehistoric predators, such as marsupial lions.

But their restricted range was a “bad bet” in the end, Hocknull said, because it pre-disposed them to a risk of extinction when a changing climate and increasing aridity disrupted the rainforest environment about 280,000 years ago.

Dr Isaac Kerr, who specialises in kangaroo palaeontology at Flinders University and was not involved with the study, said protemnodon fossils – found mainly in the south and east of the country – indicated there were several species adapted to different environments.

“Probably they were all over the whole continent, including New Guinea,” he said. A site in Tasmania had one of the latest surviving species, dated to 41,000 years ago.

Kerr said these megafauna kangaroos ranged in size but were generally stockier than their modern counterparts, with shorter feet.

Protemnodon probably looked something like a wallaroo, he said, “squat and muscular but still quite large compared to a modern kangaroo”.

Mt Etna is one of Australia's richest fossil sites, containing evidence of ancient Pleistocene rainforests and records covering periods of past environmental change when rainforests gave way to open, arid environments.

The researchers' next step was to apply similar techniques to fossils of smaller kangaroos such as tree kangaroos, pademelons and rock wallabies from Mt Etna, which still have living descendants, to understand how they survived the environmental changes while protemnodon died out.

The study compared the unique chemical signatures found in the local geology with those found in the fossilised teeth to establish the range of each animal, Gaete said.

“Strontium is an element that varies in the environment, specifically in underlying bedrocks – so a limestone will have a significantly different strontium signature compared to something like volcanic rock or basalt,” he said. These unique signatures made their way into soil and plants, and were reflected in the fossilised teeth of herbivores that ate those plants.

Laurikainen Gaete said the technique could be used to understand, on a site-by-site basis, why certain species of megafauna disappeared from particular places.

Hocknull said: “It fundamentally shifts how palaeontologists and ecologists look at the fossil record.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A US federal judge on Tuesday ordered US President Donald Trump's administration to halt efforts to shut down Voice of America (VOA), Radio Free Asia and Middle East Broadcasting Networks, the news broadcasts of which are funded by the government to export US values to the world.

US District Judge Royce Lamberth, who is overseeing six lawsuits from employees and contractors affected by the shutdown of the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), ordered the administration to “take all necessary steps” to restore employees and contractors to their positions and resume radio, television and online news broadcasts.

USAGM placed more than 1,000 employees on leave and told 600 contractors they would be terminated after the agency abruptly shut down the broadcasts last month.

The ruling was a “significant victory for press freedom,” said Andrew Celli, an attorney representing VOA employees in the lawsuits.

VOA was founded to combat Nazi propaganda at the height of World War II, and has become a major international media broadcaster.

The US Congress has funded and authorized the broadcasts to provide an “accurate, objective and comprehensive” source of news in other nations and export the “cardinal American values of free speech, freedom of the press and open debate,” Lamberth wrote.

Congress made the broadcasts mandatory and did not allow the executive branch to unilaterally terminate or defund them, he ruled.

Lamberth rejected USAGM's arguments in court that it had not made a “final decision” on the future of the broadcasts and that the lawsuits should be handled as a series of “employment disputes” with terminated workers.

“It strains credulity to conclude the USAGM is ‘still standing' when its 80-year-old flagship news service, VOA, has gone completely dark with no signs of returning,” Lamberth wrote.

During a hearing, the judge asked several questions of US lawyers probing US President Donald Trump's statements indicating that VOA's news coverage was too critical of the US and of him personally.

“I thought that one of the strengths of Voice of America was that it had the nerve to tell the truth about America,” Lamberth said.

Clayton Weimers, executive director of Reporters Without Borders USA, said the media rights group was “very pleased” with the decision on VOA and other outlets.

“Every day they're off the air is a gift to authoritarian regimes that forbid the free press, like China and Iran,” he said.

Separately, the executive producer of 60 Minutes, the storied US primetime current affairs show, on Tuesday resigned, blaming attacks on his independence in the past few months after Trump last year sued the program, accusing it of manipulating an interview with his Democratic rival, former US vice president Kamala Harris.

“Over the past months, it has also become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it. To make independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes, right for the audience,” Bill Owens, a veteran journalist on the show, wrote in an e-mail to his team seen by Agence France-Presse.

The row has intensified against a backdrop of CBS News' parent company Paramount seeking to merge with Skydance, which must first be approved by the US Federal Communications Commission.

In a post on X, directed at Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Bukele listed off a number of family members of high-level opposition figures in Venezuela, journalists and activists detained during the South American government's electoral crackdown last year.
“The only reason they are imprisoned is for having opposed you and your electoral fraud,” he wrote to Maduro. “However, I want to propose a humanitarian agreement that

Their faces lit by the cold glow of their phones, the women lining Okubo Park are evidence that sex tourism has developed as a dark flipside to the bustling Kabukicho nightlife district. 
Increasing numbers of foreign men are flocking to the area after seeing videos on social media. 
One of the women said that the area near Kabukicho, where Godzilla rumbles and belches smoke atop a cinema, has become a “real

In New York, people gathered outside the city's main library carrying signs targeting the US president with slogans such as: “No Kings in America” and “Resist Tyranny.” 
Many took aim at Trump's deportations of undocumented migrants, chanting: “No ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement], no fear, immigrants are welcome here.” 
In Washington, protesters voiced concern that Trump was threatening long-respected constitutional norms, including the right to due process.

The Power Within: The Kyiv Independent's first-ever magazine. Be among the first to get it.

Key developments on April 23:

U.S. Vice President JD Vance said on April 23 that the U.S. presented a ""very explicit proposal"" to Russia and Ukraine on a peace deal, repeating warnings Washington might drop its peace effort if the belligerent sides refuse.

Talking to journalists during a visit to India, Vance said that it is time for Kyiv and Moscow ""to either say yes or for the United States to walk away from this process.""

""We have engaged in an extraordinary amount of diplomacy and on-the-ground work. We really tried to understand things from the perspectives of both Ukrainians and Russians,"" he said. ""I think that we put together a very fair proposal.""

Vance added that ""it's now time to take, if not the final step, one of the final steps""— with all parties agreeing to stop the fighting, freeze territorial lines ""at some level close to where they are,"" and pursue a long-term diplomatic settlement.

The U.S. vice president also said that the two sides would have to give up some of the territory they control. Vance noted that eventual borders may not exactly follow the current front line but stressed it is currently necessary to lay down arms and ""freeze"" the war.

Following Vance's remarks, a spokesperson for Downing Street told AFP on April 23: ""We support U.S.-led efforts to bring about a lasting end to the war. I think that is what we all want. Ultimately, it must be for Ukraine to decide its future.""

The comments follow reporting that the U.S. is ready to recognize Russia's de jure control over Crimea and de facto control over occupied territories in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts as part of a peace deal.

Moscow occupies roughly 20% of Ukraine's sovereign territory. This includes Crimea and parts of the Donbas region occupied in 2014, and additional territories taken after the start of the full-scale war in 2022.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected the possibility of recognizing Russian hold over Crimea.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said his country will abandon the ceasefire effort in the coming days unless progress is made.

Earlier, a source close to French President Emmanuel Macron told AFP that ""respect for Ukraine's territorial integrity and its European aspirations are very strong demands of the Europeans.""

The source added that while French, British, and German officials were meeting with American and Ukrainian envoys in London for ceasefire talks, ""the objective remains to build a common approach that the United States could present to the Russians.""

A Ukrainian delegation met with European officials and U.S. Special Envoy Keith Kellogg in London on April 23 to continue discussions on a possible path to peace, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a statement on X.

""During our meeting with U.S. Special Envoy General Keith Kellogg, we had a constructive exchange of views on the path to peace,"" Sybiha wrote. ""Ukraine wants the war to end more than anyone else in the world. We are committed to working together to achieve this goal.""

The London meeting, originally intended as a ministerial-level summit involving the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, and Ukraine, was notably downgraded after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff declined to participate.

According to Reuters, Rubio pulled out after Ukraine submitted a document to European partners on April 22 declaring it would not enter talks on territorial issues until Russia agrees to a ""full and unconditional ceasefire.""

Following the meetings in London, Ukrainian Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak reiterated Kyiv's position, saying, ""An immediate, complete and unconditional ceasefire should be the first step towards the start of negotiations on achieving a just and lasting peace.""

Yermak also emphasized that Ukraine would defend its ""principled positions,"" which form the basis of its sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Despite the absence of Rubio and Witkoff, the U.K. Foreign Ministry said ""significant progress was made on reaching a common position,"" and that all parties reaffirmed support for U.S. President Donald Trump's stated commitment to achieving a just and lasting peace.

The meeting followed a summit in Paris on April 17, where senior Trump administration officials outlined a controversial peace proposal to Ukrainian and European delegates.

The plan reportedly includes recognition of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and a ban on Ukraine's NATO membership — two central demands by the Kremlin.

President Donald Trump claimed in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, that the U.S. is not forcing Ukraine to recognize Crimea as Russian, following reports that a U.S. peace plan includes the U.S. formally recognizing Moscow's illegal annexation of Crimea.

""Nobody is asking (President Volodymyr) Zelensky to recognize Crimea as Russian Territory, but if he wants Crimea, why didn't they fight for it eleven years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?"" Trump wrote on April 23.

Trump's remarks come one day after President Volodymyr Zelensky reaffirmed that Ukraine would never legally recognize Russia's control of Crimea.

""There is nothing to talk about. This violates our Constitution. This is our territory, the territory of the people of Ukraine,"" Zelensky said at a briefing in Kyiv on April 22.

In response, Trump called Zelensky's position ""harmful to the peace negotiations with Russia,"" claiming that Crimea ""was lost years ago under the auspices of President Barack Hussein Obama, and is not even a point of discussion.""

The claim that Crimea was taken without force is false. During Russia's 2014 annexation, armed Russian troops in unmarked uniforms seized Ukrainian government buildings, military installations, and blockaded bases.

At least one Ukrainian serviceman was killed, and dozens were detained or assaulted. The operation, widely condemned by the international community, violated international law.

Trump also argued that ""even before the annexation of Crimea, major Russian submarine bases"" were present there, and accused Zelensky of inflaming tensions with rhetoric that complicates peace efforts.

""He can have peace, or he can fight for another three years before losing the whole country,"" Trump wrote. ""I have nothing to do with Russia, but have much to do with wanting to save, on average, five thousand Russian and Ukrainian soldiers a week, who are dying for no reason whatsoever.""

Despite expressing frustration over Russia's refusal to de-escalate the war, the U.S. president has so far avoided imposing any major sanctions or taking punitive action against Moscow for its invasion.

While Trump appeared to frame the proposal as something Ukraine could reject, he notably did not deny that the U.S. might move forward with formally recognizing Crimea as Russian territory, something Russia had wanted for years.

Recognition of the annexation would contradict a decade of bipartisan U.S. policy and a 2014 United Nations General Assembly resolution, in which 100 member states declared the seizure illegal.

On April 22, Refat Chubarov, chairman of the Mejlis, the representative body of the indigenous Crimean Tatar people, firmly rejected any international recognition of Crimea as Russian territory.

""Crimea is the homeland of the indigenous Crimean Tatar people and an integral part of Ukraine,"" Chubarov wrote. ""Accordingly, no one can decide the fate of Crimea under any circumstances, except for the Ukrainian state and the Crimean Tatar people.""

Since 2014, Moscow has used intimidation, religious profiling, and politically motivated terrorism charges to suppress dissent among Crimean Tatars. The Mejlis' stance, Chubarov said, is grounded in international law and fully aligned with the Ukrainian Constitution.

China's Foreign Ministry on April 23 accused Ukraine of making ""groundless"" accusations after the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry summoned a Chinese ambassador to present evidence of Chinese involvement in Russia's war.

A day earlier, Chinese Ambassador to Ukraine Ma Shengkun was invited to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry to meet with Deputy Foreign Minister Yevhen Perebyinis.

Perebyinis presented the Chinese ambassador with evidence of Chinese citizens' participation in hostilities against Ukraine on Russia's side and the involvement of Chinese companies in the production of military products in Russia.

The evidence was also passed on to the Chinese side by the Ukrainian security services.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry called Ukraine's recent statements ""groundless"" and ""political manipulations.""

""We have clarified China's position on the relevant issues. China strongly opposes groundless accusations and political manipulations,"" Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said during a press briefing.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on April 17 that China is supplying weapons to Russia, marking Kyiv's first confirmation that Beijing supports Russia's war effort by direct military aid. Iran and North Korea are two other allies of Moscow that supply Russia with arms.

Though Beijing has long denied supplying arms, multiple reports have suggested otherwise. In summer 2024, Zelensky said China had assured Ukraine it would not deliver weapons to Russia.

While officially claiming neutrality, Beijing has deepened economic ties with Moscow, supported Russia against Western sanctions, and emerged as a top supplier of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense sector.

Earlier this month, Ukrainian forces captured two Chinese nationals fighting for Russia in Donetsk Oblast. Zelensky later said that ""several hundred"" Chinese nationals were fighting on Russia's side.

China has denied any direct involvement in the war and claimed it has urged its citizens to avoid armed conflicts.

Ukraine's military said on April 23 that it struck a Russian facility producing combat drones located more than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) from Ukraine's border.

Independent news channel Astra reported earlier in the day that a Ukrainian long-range drone strike had targeted Alabuga, sharing purported footage of a drone being shot down.

The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that Russian air defenses shot down one Ukrainian airplane-type drone in Tatarstan at about 12:20 p.m. local time, without providing further details or mentioning Alabuga.

The strike, carried out by Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces in coordination with other branches of the military, targeted a plant in the Alabuga Special Economic Zone of Russia's Republic of Tatarstan, the General Staff said.

The facility that was hit manufactures up to 300 Iranian-style Shahed drones and their Russian-made variants, Gerans, per day, according to the General Staff. Shahed-style drones are frequently used by Russia in attacks on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.

The attack is among Ukraine's deepest strikes into Russian territory since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. Ukraine hit targets over 1,000 kilometers last year for the first time, with one attack occurring 1,800 kilometers (1,118 miles) from the border in Russia's Murmansk Oblast.

The General Staff said that there were ""confirmed hits and explosions in the target area,"" and that the damage to the facility as a result of the attack was still being assessed.

“The strike is a justified response against a strategic military site used to support Russia's aggression and terror against Ukraine and Ukrainian civilians,"" the General Staff statement read.

Over 6,000 Shahed-type drones were produced in Alabuga last year, as well as thousands of decoy drones used to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses, said Andrii Kovalenko, an official at Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council.

Russian forces launch hundreds of drones nearly every night at Ukraine, targeting civilian areas and critical infrastructure. The attacks have intensified in recent months as Moscow continues to reject a U.S.-backed proposal for a 30-day ceasefire, which Kyiv says must include a halt to attacks on civilian infrastructure.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has urged a temporary freeze on long-range drone and missile strikes, but Kremlin officials have dismissed the idea.

Former NHL players Cal Foote, Dillon Dubé, Alex Formenton, Michael McLeod and Carter Hart, accused in a sexual assault following the World Junior Hockey Championships in 2018, arrive at the Court House in London, Ont., on April 23.The Globe and Mail/The Canadian Press

Crown attorney Heather Donkers began laying out the prosecution's case against five former members of Canada's world junior men's hockey team on Wednesday afternoon, the first day of their sexual-assault trial in London, Ont. 

This case, Ms. Donkers began, is about consent.

“This case is not about whether [E.M.] said ‘no' or removed herself from an unwelcome situation when she had the opportunity,” Ms. Donkers said. “This case is about whether [E.M.] voluntarily agreed to engage in each and every sexual act that took place, at the time that it happened.” 

The complainant's name is protected by a publication ban.

Michael McLeod, Carter Hart, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dubé and Cal Foote are accused of sexually assaulting E.M. in a hotel room after a Hockey Canada gala in June, 2018. Mr. McLeod faces a second charge of being a party to sexual assault. 

Each has pleaded not guilty.

Wednesday is the first day of what is expected to be an eight-week trial. The morning began with Ontario Superior Court Justice Maria Carroccia addressing the 14-person jury, instructing them on their obligations, including that they are to keep an open-mind and resist the urge to fall prey to myths and stereotypes about how sexual-assault complainants are supposed to behave. 

Said Ms. Donkers: “It's important that you keep this instruction in mind, as the evidence that we anticipate you will hear in this case may not match up with expectations you have about what a sexual assault is or looks like.”

The Crown's first witness will be London police Detective Tiffany Waque, who will present video surveillance from the night. The footage is from a London bar, Jack's, where E.M. encountered some of the accused players.

At the bar, E.M. – who was then 20 years old – consumed eight drinks, the Crown said. Then shortly after 1:20 a.m. on June 19, 2018, Ms. Donkers said that E.M. left Jack's with Mr. McLeod and had consensual sex at the Delta hotel in room 209. The Crown said that after this encounter, “the atmosphere in the room changed.” It is alleged that E.M. noticed Mr. McLeod was on his phone, inviting others to room. 

The jury, Ms. Donkers said, will see a copy of those text messages, including one that read: “who wants to be in a 3 way quick. 209 – mikey.”

Ms. Donkers said that the jury will also hear that Mr. McLeod went into the hallway and invited others into his room, where E.M. was laying naked. 

“There were up to 10 men inside this standard-sized hotel room at different points in the night,” Ms. Donkers said.

The Crown said that E.M. felt “drunk, surprised” by what was happening and “uncertain how to react.” Over the new few hours, various sexual acts took place between the players and E.M. 

“You will hear from some witnesses that, at different times in the night, [E.M.] was offering to perform sexual acts or was asking whether anyone was going to have sex with her,” Ms. Donkers said.

The Crown said that E.M. will explain to the jury that she was going along with what she felt was expected of her, because she was “drunk, uncomfortable” and didn't know what would happen if she didn't.

Ms. Donkers said that the jury will hear that each of the five players engaged in sexual acts with E.M. without her voluntary agreement. Mr. Dubé is accused of slapping E.M.'s naked buttocks while she was engaged in a sexual act with another player. Mr. Foote “did the splits over [E.M.]'s face while she lay on the ground, grazing his genitals over her face.”

The Crown also explained the second charge against Mr. McLeod, saying this relates to the allegation that Mr. McLeod “assisted and encouraged” his teammates to engage in sexual acts with E.M., while knowing she had not consented.

E.M. did not say “no” to the acts, Ms. Donkers said, nor did she attempt to physically resist. However, E.M. will tell the jury that she felt she had no choice, Ms. Donkers said. She was 20 years old, intoxicated and in a room with many large men whom she did not know. The players, Ms. Donkers said, were “speaking to each other as if she were not there” and were telling her to do certain things.

“On occasion, she tried to leave the room, but the men coaxed her into staying,” Ms. Donkers alleged. 

The Crown also addressed the existence of two brief videos taken that night, in which E.M. can be seen saying statements such as “it was all consensual.” Ms. Donkers noted that Justice Carroccia will explain that consent must be given for each sexual act at the time it is happening.

The prosecution's evidence has not been tested in court. The players' defence counsel will lay out their version of events later in the trial.

Canada's junior hockey team won the world championship in 2018. That June, Hockey Canada – the governing body for the sport in Canada – held a gala honouring the players in London. Afterward, many members of the team went out celebrating downtown. The sexual assault is alleged to have occurred that night.

An initial investigation from London police was closed without charges in 2019, but the file was reopened after a wave of national outrage surfaced when the case became public three years later. 

In 2022, TSN reported that Hockey Canada had quietly settled a lawsuit brought forward by the complainant. Hockey Canada entered the settlement without the players' knowledge or involvement.

The Globe and Mail then revealed that Hockey Canada had been using a so-called National Equity Fund, a pool of money collected in part through registration fees, to pay out settlements to sexual-assault complainants. Hockey Canada entered the settlement without the players' knowledge or involvement.

At the time they were charged, Mr. Dubé was a member of the Calgary Flames, Mr. Hart was with the Philadelphia Flyers, and Mr. McLeod and Mr. Foote were playing for the New Jersey Devils. Mr. Formenton, who had previously been a member of the Ottawa Senators, was playing for the Swiss club HC Ambrì-Piotta.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","IMF: Trump tariffs slow down global economic growth","https://www.dw.com/en/imf-trump-tariffs-slow-down-global-economic-growth/a-72312805","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 10:47:26 GMT","

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted higher inflation and ""significantly"" slower global economic growth due to the tariffs. It also indicated zero growth for the German economy in 2025. 

US President Donald Trump's tariffs have ""significantly"" pushed the global economy toward a downshift, reducing the global economic growth forecast for 2025 to 2.8%, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in a new report published on Tuesday. 

The global growth forecast was expected to stay at 3.1% in 2024 and rise to 3.3% in 2025, said IMF economic counsellor Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas. 

The IMF's Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR) was ""put together under exceptional circumstances,"" following Trump's announcement in April, Gourinchas said.

The US' especially high levies on China and Beijing's retaliatory measures mean lower bilateral trade, which is ""weighing down on global trade growth,"" Gourinchas told the Reuters news agency.

The GFSR's authors found that ""global financial stability risks have increased significantly, driven by tighter global financial conditions and heightened economic uncertainty.""

The ripple effects of Trump's decisions extend beyond Washington. Rising bond yields have increased in countries previously considered safe choices, driving up borrowing costs globally, the IMF reported. 

""Emerging market economies already facing the highest real financing costs in a decade may now need to refinance their debt and fund fiscal spending at higher costs,"" the global lender said.

The IMF also warned that global tensions, including wars and military conflicts, could make the financial system even more unstable. 

The IMF projects that growth would slow to 0.8% in the Euro area in 2025, and to 1.2% in 2026. Both projections are some 0.2 percentage points down from January. 

Germany was set to see economic growth of 0.0% in 2025 and 0.9% in 2026, the IMF said, cutting the European Union's largest economy's growth forecast by 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points, respectively.

Petya Koeva Brooks, the deputy director of the research department at the IMF in Washington told DW that two negative shocks had hit the global economy.

One was the level of new tariffs, bringing the effective tariff rate to levels not seen for over a century. Then, she said, policy uncertainty that had also become very high.

""The combination of those two things have resulted in those downgrades that we've seen for most countries in the world,"" said Koeva Brooks.

The best way to deal with trade disruption was cooperation among willing countries to minimize the impact, she said.

""What would be very helpful at this point is to have a stable and predictable trading system. For countries to work together in order to achieve that would be the most beneficial thing for the global economy.""

IMF financial counselor Tobias Adrian warned that the financial conditions in the past three weeks since Trump first announced the tariffs has ""an outsized impact on those more vulnerable countries.""

The global lender expected less-developed nations to fare worse, projecting a shrinkage of Mexico's economy to 0.3% this year, down from a previous projection of 1.4% growth.

Mexico rejected this projection as too pessimistic.

""We do not know what it is based on. We do not agree,"" President Claudia Sheinbaum said. ""We have a plan to strengthen the Mexican economy.""

Mexico was among the first countries to be targeted by Trump's tariffs shortly after he took office. The IMF said its downgrade for the country reflected ""weaker-than-expected activity in late 2024 and early 2025 as well as the impact of tariffs imposed by the United States, the associated uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, and a tightening of financing conditions.""

India says it will shut a key land border with Pakistan and stall a water sharing treaty as part of a round of punitive measures. It cited ""cross-border linkages"" to Kashmir's worst terror attack on civilians in decades.

India's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday said it would suspend a key water-sharing treaty with Pakistan and close a key border crossing as part of a suite of diplomatic measures against its neighbor. 

New Delhi said Islamabad needed to end ""cross-border terrorism"" after an attack in the Kashmir region that killed 26 civilians.

There was international condemnation after gunmen opened fire on tourists near the picturesque town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir in the region's worst terror attack on civilians in decades.

Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said ""cross-border linkages"" to the terrorist attack had been revealed in a security cabinet meeting, before citing a raft of measures that India would be taking against Pakistan.

The secretary said the Indus Water Treaty would be halted with immediate effect.

""The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 will be held in abeyance with immediate effect, until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism"", Misri told reporters.

Pakistan is heavily dependent on the water from the Indus River and its tributaries for agriculture and drinking water. The treaty's suspension could mean Pakistan faces severe water shortages.

Misri also said India would close the main land border,  at Attari-Wagah,  ""with immediate effect.""

Pakistan relies heavily on the Attari-Wagah crossing for trade and is more dependent on it than India.

Meanwhile, he said, Pakistani nationals would not be allowed to travel to India under a regional visa exemption scheme — and that Pakistani nationals in India traveling as part of it had 48 hours to leave the country.

Misri said there would be diplomatic consequences with defense advisors to the Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi being declared persona non grata and having a week to leave India. India would be withdrawing its advisors from the Indian High Commission in Islamabad, he added.

Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar announced that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would hold a meeting of the National Security Committee on Thursday to respond to India's statement.

The committee of senior civil and military officials is summoned in cases of external threat or major terror attack.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had cut short his trip to Saudi Arabia and returned to New Delhi on Wednesday following the attack for a meeting of the cabinet security council.

Security in the region has been beefed up since Tuesday's attack, which targeted civilians, resulting in the death of at least 26 people, with another 17 injured, in what appears to be the worst civilian attack in years.

A spokesperson for the Pakistani Foreign Ministry said his country was concerned about the loss of lives in the region, adding it wished the injured a speedy recovery.

Nevertheless, the violence has raised the threat of increased tensions between India and Pakistan, with many fingers pointed at Pakistan for the ongoing conflict in Kashmir.

Tuesday's attack drew widespread condemnation and came at a time when US Vice President JD Vance was visiting India on a four-day trip.

US President Donald Trump and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were among the leaders who expressed support to the Indian people.

The violence was one of the deadliest episodes in a long history of conflict in the disputed region that is divided principally between India and Pakistan. 

Modi was briefed by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar upon his arrival at the airport, according to local reports.

Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, part of the body responsible for domestic affairs, also cut short her trip to the US and Peru.

Interior Minister Amit Shah met with family members of those who were killed and injured in the attack in the nearby city of Srinagar.

Meanwhile, India's Defense Minister Rajnath Singh vowed to ""not only trace those who perpetrated the attack but also trace those who conspired to commit this nefarious act on our soil.""

Tens of thousands of security forces were deployed to patrol the region and set up additional checkpoints, as former militants were brought in for questioning.

Cars were searched at checkpoints, as the military and police carried out missions to locate the attackers.

The Resistance Front (TRF), an affiliate of the banned terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), claimed responsibility for the attack on social media, according to local reports.

The TRF group reportedly formed after the Modi government scrapped the special status that granted special privileges to the people of the former state of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019.

The assault on civilians on Tuesday has been described as a ""terror attack"" by Indian officials, with the region's top elected official, Omar Abdullah, posting to social media that the assault ""is much larger than anything we've seen directed at civilians in recent years.""

The suspected terror attack came as a shock as the picturesque Himalayan region has been relatively safe for civilians during the decades-long conflict.

The number of domestic tourists visiting Kashmir, officially called the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, has increased in recent years.

The last major assault in the region took place in 2019, when a suicide bomber killed 40 members of Indian security forces.

A Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) claimed responsibility for the attack and India responded by carrying out strikes in northwestern Pakistan.

			Dana White's alliance with Trump has redefined his company as more than just a typical sports brand

As Dana White, the straight-talking president of the UFC, strolled through the Kaseya Center in Miami, flanked on one side by Donald Trump and Elon Musk on the other last weekend, the crowd leapt to its feet.

While one would not normally expect to see the leader of the free world and one of his top advisers – who also happens to be the world's “richest man” – strolling through scenes of bloodied knockouts and half-naked staredowns, it was not unusual for Mr Trump, or fans of UFC.

In fact, the cheers from the blood-thirsty crowd were arguably louder and more emotionally charged than what you might expect to see at CPAC or a Trump rally.

Over the past decade, the UFC has evolved from a fringe combat league – once denounced by the late Republican senator John McCain as “human cockfighting” – into one of America's most influential cultural platforms.

It has become an arena where traditional masculinity is openly celebrated. It's a place where cancel culture goes to die, and where the chaotic, transformative energy of Maga is palpable.

At its centre is White, who rescued the company from bankruptcy in the early 2000s and transformed it into a multi-billion dollar global enterprise.

Over the past five years in particular, White has emerged as a kind of cultural kingmaker, one whose alliance with the president has redefined the UFC as more than a typical sports brand.

It is now a sanctuary for a specific kind of American identity: patriotic, macho, libertarian, and anti-woke.

Mr Trump has always been in the UFC's orbit. In fact, he was one of the few figures who offered White a platform in the sport's early days, allowing events to be hosted at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City when others refused.

White has seemingly never forgotten the gesture.

He spoke at both the 2016 and 2020 Republican conventions. Then, last November, after Trump's re-election victory, the UFC boss joined Mr Trump and his family on stage in Florida to celebrate.

Throughout the course of the election, Mr Trump used UFC events to sidestep traditional media.

The optics were carefully constructed: red-carpet entrances, handshakes with voters, and perhaps most importantly, friendly faces in the front row.

Joe Rogan, who endorsed Mr Trump, has been commentating for the UFC for decades. Andrew Schulz, who welcomed the president on his podcast, is also a regular attender. Even Andrew Tate was welcomed last month as if he wasn't under investigation for alleged sexual assault and human trafficking.

In short, this is where the “bro vote”, which helped elect Mr Trump, hangs out.

It's here chronically-online, often politically uncommitted Gen Z men who helped Mr Trump find viral fame on TikTok, and soaked up his messaging on podcasts, mix with politics.

Young white men aged between 18 and 29 voted overwhelmingly for Mr Trump, with 64 per cent of the demographic opting for the Republican, according to Tufts.

The Tufts data shows that, overall, the Republican party saw more youth votes than in 2020 – 30 per cent compared to 39 per cent last year.

Young men of colour also voted for Mr Trump in droves. There was an increase of 20 per cent in the number of black men who opted for Mr Trump, while young Latino men saw a jump of 14 per cent.

“You're getting conversations in these podcasts, and you yourself, as a young kid, get to really see who Donald Trump is,” White told The New Yorker of the media strategy. “Not the bulls--- you hear from the far-Left media.”

White's positioning against “legacy” media is not accidental. He kept heavyweight champion Jon Jones on the roster despite multiple arrests for domestic violence and driving under the influence.

He continued to back Conor McGregor after the Irishman was found liable for rape in a civil court. Mr Trump also recently met with McGregor at the White House, and suggested he was his “favourite” Irish person, despite the court's ruling.

White himself was filmed slapping his wife on New Year's Eve 2022, an incident that might have ended a career in another industry. But in the UFC universe, such moments are not only survivable, they are often framed as part of the brand's unvarnished realism. He later released a statement saying: “There's never, ever an excuse for a guy to put his hands on a woman.”

White's influence also appears to stretch beyond the cage. Earlier this month, Mr Trump revealed during a cabinet meeting that White had been instrumental in securing the release of Ksenia Karelina, a Russian-American ballerina arrested in Moscow and charged with treason over a $51 donation to a Ukraine-related charity.

She had faced up to 12 years in prison. White brought the case to Mr Trump's attention, after Karelina's fiancé – professional boxer Chris van Heerden – contacted him.

Shortly after, a prisoner swap was arranged.

It was a sign that White now operates in the realm of diplomacy, although unofficially.

He may not be a politician, but he is clearly no longer just a sports executive. His transformation draws parallels with Mr Musk.

In January, White was appointed to the board of Meta, where he will help “shape the future of social media and AI”.

Internationally, his power has also grown. The UFC has staged major events in Saudi Arabia, which is now playing a central role in negotiations to end the war in Ukraine and was set to be Mr Trump's first international visit, before it was announced he was to attend the Pope's funeral in Rome on Saturday.

White also secured lucrative partnerships to host fights in the UAE, with Mr Trump set to visit the country as part of a mini middle-eastern tour in May.

The UFC president may say he has no desire to run for office, having expressed a deep disdain for the “disgusting” world of politics after Mr Trump's comeback victory in November.

But unlike Musk, it appears White, and his world of UFC, can wield influence far from Washington DC.

It is this extraordinary ability to get inside the minds of both Mr Trump and his supporters that propels the sport, its fans and its fighters to such a unique position within Maga circles.

A protester has defaced Donald Trump's presidential plaque inside Trump Tower.

Footage shared on social media showed a man in a black T-shirt spray painting “USA” in bright green over a gold plaque marking Mr Trump's first term.

Other clips showed the man then sitting cross-legged in front of the “45th president of the United States” sign, before unfurling a flag with the logo for Extinction Rebellion sprayed on it in red.

Footage showed him later being escorted from the building.

As the man was handcuffed by security guards, another man could be heard to say: “Do not touch him.”

The protester was then led away by six men in suits.

The protester shouted: “This is your country. This is our country. This is our planet. You cannot ruin it without comment. 

“They're ruining the planet.”

At least one person heckled the protester as he was led away shouting: “Loser. Did you get picked on at school?”

A spokesperson for the New York Police Department said the force was not aware of any disruption at Trump Tower.

Extinction Rebellion NYC was contacted for comment.

Experts have said that Israel's withholding and targeting of humanitarian aid amount to genocidal acts.

Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and top Republican leaders at Mar-a-Lago agreed in a meeting that Israel should continue bombing humanitarian aid in Gaza, Ben-Gvir has said — effectively admitting that he is getting express support from top U.S. leaders to commit what experts have deemed as war crimes and genocidal acts.

Ben-Gvir is visiting the U.S. this week for the first time as minister. On Tuesday, he attended a dinner with senior Republican Party members, including GOP House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (Indiana), at the Donald Trump-owned estate. 

“I had the honor and privilege of meeting with senior members of the Republican Party at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate,” Ben-Gvir wrote in a post on social media early Wednesday morning. 

“They expressed support for my clear stance on how action should be taken in Gaza — that food and aid depots should be bombed to create military and political pressure to bring our hostages home,” he said.

Targeting humanitarian aid and relief workers without a legitimate military target is a war crime. Israel's campaign of withholding and attacking humanitarian aid efforts has been so horrific that its actions have been deemed not just violations of international law, but also genocidal acts by international law experts.

The humanitarian catastrophe that Israel has created in Gaza is currently reaching new depths, aid groups say, with Israel having blocked all aid from entering Gaza for over 50 days now. The UN has said that the crisis is at “unprecedented levels,” with all 2 million Palestinians in Gaza “trapped, starving and desperate,” with food, water, medicine, and all other essential supplies rapidly running out.

“Hunger is spreading and deepening, deliberate and manmade. Gaza has become a land of desperation. Two million people — a majority of women and children — are undergoing collective punishment,” said UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) head Philippe Lazzarini in a statement this week. “Humanitarian aid is being used as a bargaining chip and a weapon of war.”

Yet, Ben-Gvir and top Republicans reportedly believe that Israel should bomb what few supplies there are left in Gaza, in a seeming effort to accelerate Israel's extermination campaign. Ben-Gvir has repeatedly called for Israel to resettle Gaza, a genocidal plan supported by President Donald Trump and his administration.

The Trump administration is openly embracing violators of human rights. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced that he is eliminating an office whose stated mission is to advance human rights across the world, while the State Department is also eliminating condemnations of human rights violations from its annual reports, including denunciations of poor prison conditions.

At the meeting with GOP leaders, as well as dozens of business men from Miami, Ben-Gvir boasted about eroding conditions in Israel's torture camps, where Palestinians are tortured to death, among other abuses. 

While in southern Florida, Ben-Gvir also visited a police station, a prison and a Jewish-owned gun store.

On Wednesday, Ben-Gvir is slated to speak at Yale University, where students last week erected a Gaza solidarity encampment to protest his visit. Organizers disbanded the encampment on Tuesday night after threats of “retribution” from the university administration, with 200 protesters having gathered.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

            Gunmen killed at least 26 people and injured a dozen others in the disputed Himalayan region of Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday, a rare assault on tourists in an area fraught by decades of insurgency and opposition to India's rule.
    


            The devastating massacre targeted sightseers in a popular tourist destination in Pahalgam, in the mountainous Anantnag district, and is the region's worst assault on civilians in years. Most of the 26 people killed are understood to be travelers.
    


            While authorities investigate the attack, tensions are rising between India and its neighbor. Despite Pakistan denying that it had any role in the attack, India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in a Wednesday press conference that “cross-border linkages of the terrorist act” had been “brought out” during a special meeting of his country's security cabinet.
    


            Among the victims was a Nepali national, and another person of “Indian origin who works in the Middle East,” V K Birdi, inspector general of police in Kashmir, told CNN. Misri added that in addition to the Nepali citizen killed, the other 25 victims of the attack were Indian.
    


            Birdi told CNN that the attack took place in a part of the Baisaran Valley – which is only accessible by foot or on horseback. The assault unfolded in a meadow, with mountainous ridges nearby, that stretched several miles without any car roads, he said.
    


            Survivors described horror as the attack unfolded and a bloody scene wrought by the gunmen.
    


            One eyewitness told the news agency Press Trust of India that unidentified gunmen opened fire on the tourists from close range.
    


            “My husband was shot in the head while seven others were also injured in the attack,” one woman survivor said, according to PTI.
    


            Another survivor, Asavari Jagdale, told PTI the gunmen came into the tent where her family was hiding. The attackers accused the family – hailing from India's western Pune city – of supporting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, before shooting Jagdale's male relatives, including her father, she said.
    


            Local resident Abdul Waheed told CNN he jumped on his pony to help transport the injured back to areas where they could be driven to the hospital, and enlisted others in his local pony association to help. For those who were too injured, they used makeshift cots to carry them down the valley.
    


            “I saw people crying, screaming, just lying in the aftermath of the attack. There were children, women, men, everyone,” he said. “It was a massive trauma. I did not sleep all night.”
    


            A little-known militant group called The Resistance Front claimed responsibility for the attack on social media, voicing discontent at “outsiders” who had settled in the region and caused a “demographic change.” It did not provide evidence, and CNN cannot independently verify its claim.
    


            Birdi told CNN authorities were aware the group had claimed responsibility, but said they were still investigating the matter. As of Wednesday, authorities had carried out medical examinations on the victims, and flown the bodies of the deceased to their home states. Some funerals were held, including that of an Indian Navy Lieutenant who was visiting the destination with his wife.
    


            On Wednesday evening, police in Kashmir announced a reward of 200,000 Indian rupees ($2,339) for “any information leading to the neutralization of the terrorists involved in this cowardly act.”
    


            The picturesque Himalayan region, administered in part by both India and Pakistan though still disputed by both sides, is often rife with violence and has a heavy security presence – but attacks on tourists are rare.
    


            “It is an implicit sort of contract between the local population and the militant groups that the tourist trade will not be undermined because almost everyone in Kashmir, especially in the Valley, is directly or indirectly dependent on the tourism industry,” said counter-terrorism expert and author Ajai Sahni.
    


            By Tuesday night, outraged residents had gathered in the region to protest. Videos of the protest show a crowd chanting slogans, holding candles and signs that read: “Stop terrorism.” Other signs called for the resignation of Indian home affairs minister, Amit Shah. Tourists were also scrambling to leave the region, with airlines putting on extra flights.
    


            “Those behind this heinous act will be brought to justice… they will not be spared! Their evil agenda will never succeed,” Indian leader Modi wrote on X.
    


            Following the attack, Modi cut short his two-day visit to Saudi Arabia after meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
    


            India's defense minister Rajnath Singh called the attack “religiously targeted” and “cowardly” on Wednesday, adding that the Indian government will take “appropriate action.”
    


            The Indian Army corps responsible for military operations in the area of the attack said a search operation was underway to bring “the attackers to justice.” Shah, the home minister, arrived in the region on Tuesday and chaired a high-level security meeting, his office said.
    


            India has long accused Pakistan of harboring Islamist militant groups that target Kashmir, something Islamabad denies. Attacks by militants have in the past led to a sharp escalation of tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, both of whom have rival claims to the Himalayan region. India conducted air strikes inside Pakistan in 2019 following an insurgent attack on Indian soldiers.
    


            A spokesperson from Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs extended condolences to the victims, adding: “We are concerned at the loss of tourists' lives in an attack in Anantnag district of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.”
    


            The attack came a day after US Vice President JD Vance arrived in India for a visit with his family. On Tuesday, he shared condolences on X, writing: “Over the past few days, we have been overcome with the beauty of this country and its people. Our thoughts and prayers are with them as they mourn this horrific attack.”
    


            US President Donald Trump also condemned the attack, expressing US solidarity with India against terrorism and calling Modi to convey his condolences, according to Indian authorities.
    


            Other leaders from Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Iran, France, Italy and the UAE also expressed condemnation.
    


            Claimed in its entirety by both India and Pakistan, the mountainous Kashmir region has been at the epicenter of an often-violent territorial struggle between the countries for more than 70 years. The region is one of the world's most dangerous flashpoints, and a de facto border called the Line of Control divides the areas overseen by New Delhi and Islamabad.
    


            Throughout the past two decades, several domestic militant groups, demanding either independence for Kashmir or for the area to become part of Pakistan, have fought Indian security forces, with tens of thousands of people killed in the violence.
    


            Violence surged in 2018, and the Indian government took greater control of the region in 2019 amid a heavy military presence and a monthslong communications blackout.
    


            While the Indian government has said that militancy has since been reduced, attacks continue to plague the region.
    


            On Tuesday, a regional spokesperson from Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accused Pakistan of fueling terrorism in the region, and called the attack an “outcome of Pakistan's frustration.”
    


            “Pakistan and its proxies are unable to digest the return of peace and tourism in Jammu and Kashmir. They want to stifle growth and plunge the region back into fear. But we won't allow that to happen,” Altaf Thakur said.
    


            Pakistan's defense minister Khawaja Asif denied any link to the attack.
    


            “We have nothing to do with this, and we do not support terrorism anywhere,” he said in a TV interview with a Pakistani news outlet.
    


            Pakistan has denied that it had any role in the attack, but India's foreign secretary announced a number of measures against Islamabad at Wednesday night's briefing, after Modi chaired a high-level security briefing where “cross border linkages of the terrorist act were brought out,” Misri said.
    


            A significant water-sharing treaty between India and Pakistan will be suspended with immediate effect until Pakistan “credibly and irrevocably” renounces “its support for cross-border terrorism,” the foreign secretary announced.
    


            Pakistani nationals in India under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme, a scheme that allows professionals, including dignitaries, judges, parliamentarians, and journalists to enter member states visa-free, must now leave the country within 48 hours, he continued.
    


            In addition, military, naval and air advisors from the Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi must now leave India within the next week, having been declared persona non grata, Misri added. India will also withdraw its military advisors from the Indian High Commission in Islamabad and a key trading check-post between the two nations will be closed, he said.
    


            After Misri's announcement, Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar announced that his country's National Security Committee will meet on Thursday to respond to the measures.
    


            Pakistan's Minister of Energy, Awais Leghari, said in a statement that “India's reckless suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty is an act of water warfare; a cowardly, illegal move. Every drop is ours by right, and we will defend it with full force — legally, politically, and globally.”
    


            Local Kashmiris are fearful of a growing anti-Kashmiri and anti-Muslim sentiment brewing on social media and in statements made on national news channels.
    


            “All of Kashmir is in grief and shock, terror has no religion, these haunting images will remain etched in our collective memory, but we are being defamed,” Nasir Khuehami of the Jammu and Kashmir Students Association told CNN Wednesday from Srinagar, the largest city in Jammu and Kashmir.
    


            “Kashmiris have always faced violence and we know what it is like to lose a father or son, we empathize with these families,” he said, adding he has been receiving messages from Kashmiri students across the country who are afraid of being attacked.
    


            Sahni, the counter-terrorism expert, said the attack would likely fuel both sides – celebrated as a triumph by Islamist extremists, and feeding fear and Islamophobia among India's majority Hindu population, thus deepening already-fraught tensions between the two faiths.
    


            “Since this has been an attack specifically on Hindu tourists, so once again it will feed into the communal narrative on both sides,” she added.
    


            Pahalgam lies on a major pilgrimage route, known as the Amarnath Yatra, which takes place every year and has been exposed to previous attacks.
    


            Thousands of tourists flock to Kashmir during its peak season each year, which runs from March to August.
    


            The last major attack on tourists in the region took place in June. At least nine people were killed and 33 others injured when a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims plunged into a gorge, after suspected militants fired on the vehicle.

Five years after Harvey Weinstein's original #MeToo trial delivered a searing reckoning for one of Hollywood's most powerful figures, the ex-studio boss is on trial again after an appeals court threw out his landmark rape conviction.

NEW YORK (AP) — Harvey Weinstein 's #MeToo retrial opened Wednesday, giving a new jury a fresh look at familiar rape and sexual assault allegations — plus a newly added claim from a former model.

For the first time, prosecutors publicly identified Kaja Sokola and detailed her account of what unfolded between her and the Oscar-winning movie producer in the early 2000s. He is criminally charged with forcing oral sex on her in 2006, but she also accused him in a civil lawsuit of groping her against her will four years earlier, when she was 16.

Like the two other accusers in the case, Sokola alleges a complex series of encounters and reactions — being sexually assaulted, yet staying in touch, wary of Weinstein but wanting to remain on good terms with a power broker who dangled the possibility of an acting career.

“Why did the defendant hold this level of power and control in the eyes of these three women? … It's because Harvey Weinstein defined the field,” prosecutor Shannon Lucey told jurors in an opening statement. “He knew how tempting promises of success were. He produced, he choreographed, he therefore directed, their ultimate silence for years.”

AP correspondent Julie Walker reports Harvey Weinstein's rape retrial has started with opening arguments.

Weinstein has pleaded not guilty, and defense lawyer Arthur Aidala countered by portraying the accusers as willing partners in a showbiz quid pro quo.

“The casting couch is not a crime scene,” Aidala told the majority-female jury. He compared prosecutors' allegations to the preview of a movie that “falls flat on its face.” 




The 73-year-old Weinstein, seated in the wheelchair he now uses because of health problems, didn't look at Lucey or the jury during her presentation before Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and others in a packed courtroom audience. But Weinstein watched intently as Aidala outlined his defense. 

The retrial is happening because New York's top court last year threw out Weinstein's conviction, which in 2020 was a watershed moment for the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct. The high court found that the previous trial judge allowed prejudicial testimony about allegations that were separate from the charges.

Weinstein's retrial is playing out at a different cultural moment than the first. #MeToo, which exploded in 2017 with allegations against Weinstein, has evolved and ebbed.

At the start of Weinstein's first trial, chants of “rapist” could be heard from protesters outside. This time, there was none of that. 

Nevertheless, Sokola's lawyer, Lindsay Goldbrum, has called Weinstein's retrial a “signal to other survivors that the system is catching up — and that it's worth speaking out even when the odds seem insurmountable.”

While this jury won't hear about the allegations that got the first conviction thrown out, the panel is expected to hear from Sokola. After the high court sent the case back for retrial, prosecutors added a criminal sex act charge based on her allegations. 

The Polish-born Sokola met Weinstein in 2002 after traveling alone to New York for a modeling trip at age 16, according to prosecutors. She alleges he invited her to lunch to discuss potential acting jobs but detoured to his apartment and demanded she take off her shirt if she wanted to make it in the movie business. Then, Sokola alleges, Weinstein fondled her while making her touch his genitals.

Over the next few years, Sokola stayed in contact with Weinstein, even after telling him off for allegedly groping her in a car around 2004, Lucey told jurors. She said Weinstein arranged for Sokola to be an extra and talk to the stars of the 2007 rom-com “The Nanny Diaries,” and she invited him to lunch with her visiting sister, hoping to impress the sibling. 

After the lunch, he lured Sokola to his Manhattan hotel room by saying he had scripts for her to see, ordered her to undress, held her down on a bed, and performed oral sex on her while she tearfully implored him not to do so, Lucey said.

In the weeks after, Sokola was photographed with Weinstein and a third person at an event, and his company wrote her a recommendation letter for acting school, the prosecutor said. Lucey told jurors that power imbalances often “cause victims to behave in ways that laypersons possibly might not expect.”

After other allegations emerged against Weinstein in 2017, Sokola sued. Prosecutors said she received $3.5 million in compensation. 

Aidala said Sokola and the other accusers were “trying to take advantage of Mr. Weinstein when he was at the top,” then benefited from making allegations “when he was headed toward the bottom.”

Outside court, Sokola's attorney decried Weinstein's defense as full of “victim blaming” and “rape myths.”

In addition to the charge related to Sokola, Weinstein is being retried on a criminal sex act charge for allegedly forcibly performing oral sex on then-production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006, and a third-degree rape charge for allegedly assaulting then-aspiring actor Jessica Mann in 2013.

Weinstein's 2020 acquittals on two other charges — predatory sexual assault and first-degree rape — still stand.

The Associated Press generally does not identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley, Mann and Sokola have done.

""The Big Weekend Show"" analyzes the possibilities of artificial intelligence when it comes to influencing voters.

If you haven't heard the buzz about Manus yet, it's the new AI model unveiled by a Singapore-based company called Butterfly Effect. This isn't just another chatbot. It's one of the first truly autonomous AI agents, able to do its own research, make decisions and even carry out plans, all with barely any human oversight.

Sounds impressive, right? But here's the thing: While all this innovation opens up exciting possibilities, it also brings some serious privacy and security questions. Whether you're eager to try out the latest AI or you'd rather steer clear, it's worth understanding what Manus could mean for your personal data and digital safety.

STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS – SIGN UP FOR KURT'S ‘THE CYBERGUY REPORT' NOW

First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus) (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)

This has already been happening for a while with other AI models. There have been several class-action lawsuits against tech companies for scraping personal data for use in AI training, with one lawsuit claiming that OpenAI uses ""stolen private information, including personally identifiable information, from hundreds of millions of internet users, including children of all ages, without their informed knowledge or consent.""

Many companies also sell or share data with third parties, including for the purposes of AI training. For example, X has been using personal data to train its AI, Grok, and is also sharing user data with third parties to train AI models. So whether you use AI (including Manus AI when it's released to the public) or not, there's still a good chance that they have your personal information.

First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus) (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)

GOOGLE'S NEW AI TECH MAY KNOW WHEN YOUR HOUSE WILL BURN DOWN

It boils down to data privacy and security. When AI companies collect personal information – things like your name, email address, home location, social media posts and even photos – they often store it in large databases to train their models. If those databases aren't properly secured, they can become gold mines for hackers. Think of them as digital ""honey pots"": sweet and tempting to cybercriminals because of all the personal data inside.

This isn't just a theoretical risk. Just this year, another AI company, DeepSeek, experienced a major leak that exposed more than a million sensitive records. When this kind of information gets out, it can end up on the dark web where scammers and identity thieves are more than happy to scoop it up. That's how people end up dealing with everything from identity theft and impersonation to tons of spam calls, phishing emails and targeted scams.

But data leaks aren't the only danger. Even when the information is secure, it can be misused or manipulated in ways that are hard to detect. One of the biggest new threats is something called a prompt injection attack.

In simple terms, prompt injection is a way for attackers to trick an AI into doing something it wasn't supposed to. Researchers recently found that attackers can embed hidden commands in seemingly harmless text, like a website bio, email signature or even a social media post. When the AI reads that text during training or browsing, it can accidentally follow the hidden instructions, which might tell it to leak information, change how it behaves or give unauthorized access to private data.

First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus) (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)

DANGERS OF OVER-SHARING WITH AI TOOLS

Unlike most AI tools that respond to commands you give them directly, Manus is autonomous, meaning it can act on its own, follow links, read content and make decisions without human approval. While that sounds pretty cool, it's also what makes it a lot harder to spot when something goes wrong.

If Manus encounters malicious content, it could unknowingly follow a hidden prompt, compromise your data or alter its behavior, and there may be no obvious sign that anything has happened until it's too late. There are also some concerns about where Manus sends and stores data. Security researchers have traced data back to servers in Shenzhen, China, raising red flags about surveillance, jurisdiction and who might ultimately have access to your information.

So even if Manus isn't scraping anything too sensitive today, the combination of weak oversight, powerful automation and questionable data practices makes it far riskier than your average AI assistant.

We reached out to Manus AI for a comment on this article but did not hear back before our deadline.

GENAI, THE FUTURE OF FRAUD AND WHY YOU MAY BE AN EASY TARGET

As I've mentioned, whether you use Manus AI or not, your personal information will still likely end up in its datasets, so the best way to protect yourself is to make your information difficult to find. Here are some things you can do.

1) Be cautious about using Manus: With that level of autonomy, especially since it's a very new AI (not to mention the inconsistency in its privacy policy regarding governance), I wouldn't recommend using it quite yet. There's just too much damage it can do if it malfunctions or is subject to a prompt injection attack.

2) Keep your personal information under wraps: With so many companies selling and trading personal information, many of them to tech companies to train AI, it's a good idea to withhold your data unless you absolutely can't avoid sharing it.

3) Actively remove your personal information from the internet so your data can't be scraped by AI models like Manus: Set your social media to private, limit data collection through privacy settings and remove your information from data brokers and people-search sites. Autonomous cloud-based agents such as Manus are designed to extract and analyze vast amounts of online data, and your publicly available information can be swept into their training datasets without your knowledge or consent.

While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.

4) Use strong antivirus software to help defend against the broader attack surface created by autonomous AI systems: Manus' ability to act independently and interact with external systems increases the risk of adversarial attacks and malware transmission, so robust endpoint security is essential to protect your devices and data.

The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.

5) Use privacy-focused products and services: Whenever you cannot avoid sharing personal information, opt for companies that prioritize your privacy. For example, use the DuckDuckGo browser instead of Chrome and Brave or Proton Mail instead of Gmail. Check out the best private and safe browser alternatives to Google.

6) Keep all software updated, including your operating system, browsers and security tools, to patch vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit: As AI agents like Manus operate in the cloud and may interact with your systems, unpatched software can become an easy target for exploitation or unauthorized access. Therefore, it's always a good idea to keep software, operating systems, browsers and security tools updated at all times.

7) Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) on all your accounts: As AI-driven attacks and automated data extraction become more common, MFA adds a crucial layer of defense, making it much harder for attackers to compromise your accounts, even if an AI system leaks or scrapes your credentials.

8) Use strong, unique passwords for every account: As cloud-based AI agents like Manus can interact with external systems and potentially access sensitive data, unique passwords help prevent a breach of one account from leading to a broader compromise. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.

As we move forward with AI like Manus, it's exciting to think about the possibilities, but it's also important to keep our eyes open about what it means for our personal data. Even if you never use Manus yourself, your info could still end up in its training data.

So what can you do? Stay informed, take charge of your digital footprint and choose tools that prioritize your privacy. As AI keeps evolving, being proactive about your data is the best way to enjoy the benefits of innovation while keeping your personal info safe.

Do you think companies behind powerful AI agents like Manus should be required to follow stricter privacy rules and independent oversight before they're allowed to collect and use people's data? Let us know by writing us at Cyberguy.com/Contact.

The Justice Department argued to a judge at a hearing on Wednesday that she should dismiss a lawsuit brought by Perkins Coie, a prominent Democratic-aligned law firm, over allegations that President Donald Trump unconstitutionally revoked its employees' security clearances and attempted to curb its lucrative work with government contractors.

Richard Lawson, a deputy associate attorney general, told Judge Beryl Howell that the heart of the dispute between Perkins Coie and the Trump administration was whether the president's order was issued under “executive discretion” or whether it was a constitutional violation intended to punish lawyers for their viewpoints.

“We view this as not designed to punish,” Lawson said. “We view this as designed to fulfill the concerns that were laid out in section one” of the executive order.

Howell, an Obama appointee, is weighing the government's request to dismiss the case and whether to grant Perkins Coie a permanent injunction. She previously imposed a temporary, partial block on Trump's order against the firm.

The hearing comes as Trump has picked off Big Law firms one by one, targeting each of them with executive orders or announcing agreements reached with them. About half a dozen have been named in executive orders that strip their employees of security clearances, block them from entering federal buildings, and warn government contractors not to use the firms.

Perkins Coie, one of Trump's top targets, has spearheaded legal fights waged by some of the firms that chose to fight the orders and is furthest along in the court process. Judges have sided entirely with the firms in the early stages of litigation. The hearing with Howell continued into Wednesday afternoon, and one with WilmerHale is scheduled for later in the day.

Perkins Coie, in particular, was tied to the dissemination of the discredited Trump-Russia dossier during the president's first campaign.

Trump said in his order that Perkins Coie was “dangerous” because while it was representing Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election, the firm hired Fusion GPS, which used former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to craft the dossier. The document, containing salacious but unsubstantiated claims about Trump, leaked to the media and dominated headlines during his first term. One of Perkins Coie's then-partners, Michael Sussmann, was prosecuted over allegations that he lied to the FBI about his work with Clinton when encouraging the FBI to investigate Trump's Russia ties, but he was later acquitted by a jury.

Perkins Coie hired the prestigious law firm Williams & Connolly to argue to Howell that Trump's order would cripple the firm and that it was unconstitutional.

Some firms, including Paul Weiss, have reached agreements with the administration that involve the firms committing millions of dollars in pro bono services to the government. Howell noted during the hearing that Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller, recently touted that the White House had secured nearly $1 billion in services.

“The purpose was not to force Perkins to its knees to come up with more to reach the $1 billion goal of a free legal fund?” Howell asked Lawson.

“I don't view it that way, your honor,” the attorney replied.

The hearing also came hours after Trump raged at the firm on social media and called Howell an “unmitigated train wreck.” The president appeared to reference an unsuccessful lawsuit he brought against Perkins Coie in Florida. He also cited a decision Howell made against him in an unspecified past case.

WHY TRUMP'S FIGHT WITH BIG LAW HAS SOME DEFENDERS IN THE LEGAL WORLD

“Her ruling was so pathologically bad that it became the ‘talk of the town,'” Trump wrote. “I could have a 100% perfect case and she would angrily rule against me. It's called Trump Derangement Syndrome, and she's got a bad case of it.”

Last month, the DOJ unsuccessfully attempted to recuse her from the lawsuit with Perkins Coie.

President Donald Trump is planning to install two 100-foot flagpoles on the White House grounds.

The president announced the plans for the flagpoles, which he said he would pay for out of his own pocket, after he emerged from the White House residence just before 11 a.m. Wednesday with a coterie of aides and Secret Service agents.

Trump said the White House would be installing “two beautiful poles” on the grounds that would be “top of the line.”

“It was something I've often said, you know, they don't have a flagpole per se,” he said of his design proposals. “So we're putting one right where you saw us, and we're putting another one on the other side, on top of the mounds. It's going to be two beautiful poles.”

Prior to his announcement, Trump went on a roughly 10-minute walk across the White House grounds, where he appeared to discuss the potential changes to the North Lawn.

TRUMP HAS ‘NO INTENTION' OF FIRING FED CHAIRMAN JEROME POWELL

Before reentering the White House, Trump did a brief question-and-answer session about his desired flagpoles and the impacts of his tariff agenda, during which he claimed that his negotiations with China and other trade partners are progressing.

“Every country wants to partake, even countries that have ripped us off for many, many years, China, as an example,” Trump said. “But it's not just China, European Union. They ripped us off for many, many years. And those days are over. Everybody wants to be a part of what we're doing. They know that they can't get away with it any longer, but they're still going to do fine, and we're going to have a country that you can be proud of.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Yale professor David W. Blight explains why Trump is far from the first to try to rewrite the record.

by  Amanda Lewellyn

History has been disappearing from government websites. 

First, it was Stonewall. The word “transgender” was removed from the National Park Service page commemorating the 1969 Stonewall Uprising, at which trans activists Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera played a central role. The acronym LGBTQ was also changed to just “LGB.” 

Then, Harriet Tubman was erased from a page about the Underground Railroad, and the language changed to highlight “Black/white cooperation.” A page about Jackie Robinson's Army service was taken down from the Pentagon's website. (Both pages were later restored after public criticism.) A Washington Post investigation also found that at least half a dozen pages referencing the Little Rock Nine, the Black students who integrated an Arkansas high school in the 1950s, previously said the students had “opened doors” for those seeking “equality and education.” Now, the pages say the students were just seeking “education.” 

The edits come amid the Trump administration's push to end DEI and “restore truth and sanity” to American history, an effort causing alarm among historians like Yale professor David W. Blight. 

In an interview with Noel King on Today, Explained, Blight says the changes amount to a brazen attempt to rewrite our past — but that America is no stranger to revisionist history. The country has rewritten and re-saved and re-pushed its narrative of events so many times that it might as well look like the filename of a high schooler's final project. 

Below is an excerpt of the conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever else you get your podcasts.

Reporters will often say, “Donald Trump is unprecedented. The things that he does are unprecedented.” But I imagine you would tell me that the United States has tried to rewrite its own history, at certain points. 

Many times, yes. 

Give me some examples of the times we've tried to do this. 

During World War II, the United States created a massive propaganda machine called the Office of War Information. That's what governments do during wartime. That organization did indeed engage in a lot of propaganda, selling stories to keep Americans patriotic. 

Moving ahead from that to McCarthyism: Anti-communism was a very deep phenomenon in America — and not without some reason in the '30s and '40s. But McCarthyism caused a wave of attempts of trying to control what writers wrote, what historians could teach, who could teach anything. 

Let's take the Civil War. In 1865 to 1870, there was an organization in the South called the Southern Historical Society. That was originally made up mostly of former Confederate officers who were determined to try to control the story of what the war had been about, what they had actually fought for, what their crusade meant, what the Confederacy actually was.

The ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.

What was the story they were trying to sell? 

They told a story that we've come to know as the “Confederate Lost Cause.” Namely, they were arguing early on that they did not really lose the war on the battlefield, they only lost to superior numbers and resources. They said they lost only to “the leviathan of northern industrialization.” There's some truth in that, but that's not the full explanation. 

They also argued that the war was not really about slavery. It was really about state sovereignty and states' rights. It was really about resisting the federal interference with their lives and their civilization and their morays and folkways…

Can I jump in and tell you something?

Sure. 

I'm from central New York. I went to public school. That was what I learned. 

Wow. 

Why did I learn something that wasn't true in public school? 

Because over time, in culture, schooling, politics, and rituals from the 1870s and '80s well on into the 20th century — and still surviving in a textbook you were learning from in the 1990s, I am sorry to hear — was this idea that the United States divided had this all-out horrific war. But it had to put itself back together again. 

How do you put back together something so horrifically divided? You're going to have to find mutuality. You're going to have to find some kind of unified narrative. Well, one of the unified narratives they did develop in the 19th century — and there's reality to this — is that you unify around the valor of soldiers. But if we admire valor without ever looking at the cause for which they fought, it's of course limited. 

“Our greatness is in the amazing strivings and triumphs of all kinds of people in the past who challenged power.”

Now, the typical and powerful belief was that everybody in that war fought for the cause they believed in. And if you fought for the cause you believed in with great valor, you fought for the right [reasons]. Everybody was equal in valor. The causes had to be muted, put aside. Well, you know, that's a part of human relations as well: How do you keep a family together? Well, there's some things you don't talk about.

But for nations and whole peoples and cultures, the danger in this is that the stories you take on, the stories that you develop that define the identity of your nation — the identity of your past and now your future — is going to leave somebody out. In fact, it may end up allowing you to reconcile on the backs of those who most suffered from the conflict you are trying to reconcile. Obviously, in America, that meant Black Americans. It meant their civil and political rights, which were created and then slowly but surely abandoned and then crushed in the Jim Crow system of the South. 

Now, the point of all of this is that the Confederate Lost Cause, which said the South fought for noble ends, they fought for their homes, they fought for their sovereignty, they fought for their integrity. … It eventually becomes, though, not a story of loss at all. It becomes, by the 1890s and into the 20th century, a victory narrative. 

This was an age of a lot of sentimental literature. Americans came to love stories of the Old South. Of course, it's there in Gone With the Wind, still, maybe the most famous movie ever made. So the Lost Cause was both a political movement and it was a literary movement. But it was at its core a racial ideology, and it lasted a very long time. 

Let's compare to what we're seeing today. What you're talking about with these popular books and Gone With the Wind, that seems to me more subtle than the president saying, “You delete that information about Jackie Robinson's military service from the website.” Will what Trump is doing succeed because it is so unsubtle? 

That's a very good question and my instinctive answer — and it's partly my wishful answer — is that no he won't. It is not subtle, you're right: They're wiping out websites. They are explicitly saying, “Professional history, whether it's in our greatest museums or our greatest university, has been teaching us all the wrong ways. They've been dividing us.” This is the word they love to use: The history we write has been divisive, divisive, divisive. 

Well, no, it's not. It's simply informative. Sometimes it gets people riled up and sometimes it gets them arguing and sometimes fighting. But what the Trumpists are doing is telling us that they know better — policy people at the Heritage Foundation or pseudo-historians who think that studying all this stuff about race, gender, all the ethnicities that make us up, all this pluralism, is just taking away from “American greatness.” They use that term a lot: “We're no longer teaching our youth about American greatness.” 

Yes we are! We're teaching our youth that our greatness is in the pluralism. Our greatness is in the amazing strivings and triumphs of all kinds of people in the past who challenged power. 

What will you know about World War I if you try to find nothing but greatness? What will you know about the history of imperialism and expansion if all you wanna know is about greatness? What will you actually know about Native American history if all you look for is greatness? 

It defies the intelligence of anyone with an education, and a whole lot of people who don't have a lot of formal education. I'm not very optimistic right now about what's going on, but I do have a certain faith that people just aren't going to buy this.

Microsoft is offering a new choice to employees who are deemed low performers: Accept a payout to quit or risk termination on a performance improvement plan.

An internal email sent to Microsoft managers on Friday disclosed the company's new ""globally consistent"" performance improvement plan with ""clear expectations and a timeline for improvement.""

Affected employees can enter the PIP or quit and accept a ""Global Voluntary Separation Agreement (GVSA),"" the email, viewed by Business Insider, said.

""This performance improvement process is available year-round so you can act quickly to transparently address performance issues, while offering employees choice,"" said the email, which was from  Amy Coleman, Microsoft's new chief people officer.

Another internal Microsoft document viewed by BI said that the payout to employees would be equal to 16 weeks of pay. Affected staff have five days to decide which option to take. If they choose to start the PIP, the payout is off the table, this internal document said.

The new PIP system may work differently outside the US, as other countries have different laws. Microsoft declined to comment.

Microsoft's approach is similar to Amazon's Pivot program, which offers a PIP option or a payout if the employee leaves.

BI has reported extensively on Pivot, a central cog in a broader Amazon performance review system that some employees have said is designed to meet firing quotas rather than revive careers.

Amazon has defended its system in the past. In 2021, the company told BI that it provided managers ""with tools to help employees improve their performance and grow in their careers."" It added: ""This includes resources for employees who are not meeting expectations and may require additional coaching.""

The latest changes come as Microsoft, and the tech industry overall, shifts toward more rigorous performance expectations and less coddling.

Earlier this year, Microsoft fired 2,000 employees deemed underperformers without severance.

Leaders in at least some parts of the company are considering additional performance-based cuts as soon as May. They're looking at cutting middle managers and how to increase the ratio of coders versus noncoders on projects.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","First, Microsoft tapped the AI data center brakes. Now analysts are worried about Amazon.","https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-ai-data-center-demand-aws-microsoft-2025-4","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

First, it was Microsoft. Now Amazon is raising eyebrows on Wall Street as fresh signs suggest the cloud giant may be easing off the accelerator in the race to build AI data centers.

Some analysts are concerned that Amazon Web Services, the dominant cloud provider, may be entering a digestion phase that could slow momentum in the data center market.

The speculation gained traction Monday when the famed short seller Jim Chanos posted a simple and ominous remark on X, alongside an analyst note suggesting caution around AWS's data center plans.

Data Centers #UhOh pic.twitter.com/fRWNFxMV58

That note, published by Wells Fargo analysts, cited industry sources who reported this weekend that AWS paused discussions for certain new colocation data center deals, particularly international ones. The analysts stressed that the scale of the pause remains unclear, though they're worried.

""It does appear like the hyperscalers are being more discerning with leasing large clusters of power, and tightening up pre-lease windows for capacity that will be delivered before the end of 2026,"" the analysts wrote.

The same day, TD Cowen analysts published similar findings from their own data center research.

""Our most recent checks point to a pullback in US colocation deals from Amazon,"" they wrote in a note to investors. Colo deals, as they're known in the industry, involve different companies sharing space in the same data center.

""We are aware of select colocation deals that it walked away from, as well as expansion options that it chose not to exercise,"" the Cowen analysts added.

They also said that their recent industry checks point to a slowdown in Amazon's AI ambitions in Europe.

""This is a dynamic we will continue to monitor,"" the analysts wrote.

More broadly, Cowen's analysts have spotted a cooling in the data center market, relative to the frenzied activity of recent years.

""We observed a moderation in the exuberance around the outlook for hyperscale demand which characterized the market this time last year,"" they wrote, laying out three specific signs of calmer times:

Some context is important here. The AI data center market has been gangbusters since OpenAI's ChatGPT burst onto the scene in late 2022 and showed the potential of generative AI technology.

These signs of moderation are pretty small in relation to this huge trend. However, trillions of dollars in current and planned investments are riding on the generative AI boom. With so much money on the line, any inkling that this rocket ship is not ascending at light speed is unnerving.

These signals from Amazon echo similar moves by Microsoft, which recently halted some data center projects.

""Like Microsoft, AWS seems to be digesting recent aggressive leasing activity,"" the Wells Fargo analysts wrote.

They clarified that this doesn't mean signed deals are being canceled, but rather that AWS is pulling back from early-stage agreements like Letters of Intent or Statements of Qualifications—common ways that cloud providers work with partners to prepare for data center projects.

In response to these growing concerns, Kevin Miller, the vice president of global data centers at AWS, posted on LinkedIn on Monday to offer some clarity.

""We continue to see strong demand for both Generative AI and foundational workloads on AWS,"" he wrote.

He said that AWS has thousands of cloud customers around the world and must weigh multiple solutions to get them the right capacity at the right time.

""Some options might end up costing too much, while others might not deliver when we need the capacity,"" Miller wrote. ""Other times, we find that we need more capacity in one location and less in another. This is routine capacity management, and there haven't been any recent fundamental changes in our expansion plans.""

Miller's comments aim to position the pause not as a red flag, but as part of the normal ebb and flow of data center growth.

Historically, these digestion periods, marked by slowing new leases or deferred builds, can last six to 12 months before a rebound, the Wells Fargo analysts wrote. Google, for instance, pulled back from leasing in the second half of 2024, only to return aggressively in early 2025, they noted.

The Cowen analysts said Amazon's recent cautious moves to pull back on colocation deals may be related to efforts to increase efficiency across its data center operations. Also, AWS typically doesn't do a lot of colocation deals anyway, preferring instead to build its own data centers, the analysts wrote.

They also wrote that other tech giants, such as Meta and Google, are still aggressively pursuing new capacity.

The bottom line? While AWS appears to be taking a breath, the AI cloud race is far from over. Analysts and investors will watch closely to see whether this pause marks a brief recalibration or a more significant shift in AI strategy.

After more than a decade of hype, Tesla is only a few months away from its Robotaxi launch.

It may be the one deadline the electric vehicle maker and its CEO Elon Musk can't afford to miss.

Tesla is famous for blowing past key dates. Investors even coined the term ""Elon Time"" to describe the phenomenon. But Robotaxi is different. The company has been staring down a tanking stock price, a brand crisis, and angst over Musk's work with the Department of Government Efficiency. It has also positioned fully autonomous driving — of which Robotaxi is a crucial arm — as central to its profitability.

A missed deadline would make a historically bad year even worse. A timely and successful Robotaxi launch, on the other hand, would make good on years-long promises, quell investor jitters, and signal that it can keep up with fierce competition.

During Tuesday's earnings call, Musk reiterated the company's commitment to the June launch. He's ""laser-focused"" on it, he said, adding that the future of the company hinges on its ability to bring autonomous vehicles to the market. While its automotive revenue fell 20% during the first quarter, its stock was up more than 7% this morning following Musk's commitment to the Robotaxi release and his plans to step back from DOGE.

Musk has repeatedly emphasized the importance of self-driving tech, warning that Tesla is worth ""virtually zero"" without it.

Musk has also made several moves in recent years to distance Tesla from traditional automakers by positioning it as a tech company. Unlike traditional automakers, Tesla hasn't tried to keep up with continually refreshed models and new releases. Instead, it has chosen to pour resources into its Autopilot division.

Investors are expecting follow-through. ""Musk needs to lay out for investors the timing/rollout of unsupervised FSD in Austin this summer,"" noted Tesla bull Dan Ives said in an analyst note on Sunday.

Tesla has yet to set a date for the event in June in Austin. On Tuesday, Musk said people would be able to pay to ride in Model Ys equipped with self-driving technology. He added that the company has not decided yet how many vehicles will be available during the initial launch, but that it could start with 10 to 20 vehicles.

We'll ""watch it carefully to scale it up rapidly after that,"" Musk said. ""We want to make sure we're paying very close attention.""

The company did not respond to a request for comment.

Tesla initially unveiled its Cybercab in October. The event disappointed some investors and sent Tesla stock down 10% the day after the event, but shares quickly rebounded.

Within Tesla, there has been little information about the upcoming release. Unlike the October event, some workers told Business Insider they are unaware of when the event will take place within June or how it will be organized.

Musk has joked about being ""pathologically optimistic.""

""I always bite off more than I chew (sigh) & then sit there with puffed out cheeks like a squirrel that ate too much,"" he said in an X post in 2023.

Most of Tesla's launches have faced optimistic deadlines. The Model X was released more than a year after Musk had promised; it also took longer than Musk predicted to scale Model 3 production.

Some of the carmaker's more recent products have had similar delays. The Tesla Semi began limited deliveries three years later than the carmaker predicted. The Cybertruck was delivered two years late with a price tag $20,000 higher than initially promised for its cheapest model. And Tesla's $25,000 EV and the second-generation Roadster have overshot deadlines with no firm delivery date in sight.

Several of Musk's biggest promises have revolved around Tesla's self-driving efforts. Musk said in 2015 that Teslas would be fully autonomous within two to three years. In 2018, Musk said full self-driving was ""a year away,"" and in 2019, he said it would be complete by the end of the year.

Tesla first released a beta version of what it calls ""Full Self-Driving"" software in 2020. Despite its name, it requires a licensed driver to operate the vehicle and functions largely as a driver-assist feature that can change lanes, stop at traffic lights, and execute turns.

During Tesla's fourth quarter earnings call in January, Musk joked that he was the ""boy who cried FSD.""

While investors have been able to brush off missed deadlines in the past, they may be nearing a breaking point. The carmaker is facing one of its most precarious moments since its Model 3 ramp-up, when Musk said Tesla narrowly skirted bankruptcy.

On Tuesday, Tesla reported its worst quarterly results since 2021. The brand has faced a series of large-scale protests over the past few months and sales have continued to slip.

Musk dismissed concerns about the carmaker on Tuesday. Tesla has been on the ""ragged edge of death"" many times in the past, he said.

""This is not one of those times. We're not on the ragged edge of death, not even close,"" he said.

Though he anticipates ""some unexpected bumps this year,"" Musk — as ever — said he remains optimistic.

Big banks like Citigroup and Natixis thought they were backing a $1 billion fintech darling. But when Stenn blew up, most of its supposed partners said they had never worked with the company.

Every week during the years leading up to its sudden collapse in December, Stenn Technologies sent an email to some of the world's biggest finance firms.

The emails contained pages of data from a trade-finance deal that London-based Stenn had arranged that grew to almost $1 billion in size, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg and people familiar with the matter. Citigroup Inc., BNP Paribas SA, Natixis and HSBC Holdings Plc were among the biggest investors while Barclays Plc, M&G Plc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s asset-management unit had also backed the transaction.

Also bilateral trading, direct private equity and hedge fund timing.

One model of capital markets is that volatility is bad and stable policy is good. Investors are more likely to commit capital to socially productive projects if they expect a reasonably predictable reward. Investing is a way to participate in long-term economic growth, and steady growth helps investors to plan for the future and entrepreneurs to raise capital.

Another model of capital markets is that people like gambling, so introducing some extra volatility makes markets more fun and exciting and gives people what they want. How much should you save for retirement? Should you borrow money to build a new factory? Boring! Boring! Don't ask those questions! Ask more fun questions like “should I YOLO all my money on GameStop call options?” On this model, economic policymakers should lurch drastically from one policy to another, because that will make things more exciting for their audience. It will also get the policymakers more attention, and attention is the most valuable thing in the world.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The Consumer Brands Association had previously proposed that manufacturers voluntarily begin phasing out synthetic dyes.

The US Department of Health and Human Services said Tuesday it plans to work with food companies to phase out use of many artificial food colorings by 2026, but industry lobbyists say there's no agreement in place to remove the dyes, according to people familiar with the matter.

In its announcement, HHS said it planned to eliminate artificial food dyes by working with companies that rely heavily on them. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said his agency and the Food and Drug Administration had an “understanding” with the industry about their removal on a voluntary basis.

A dozen states sued President Donald Trump and his administration on Wednesday, seeking a court order declaring that his new tariffs on foreign imports are illegal.

""The president does not have the power to raise taxes on a whim, but that's exactly what President Trump has been doing with these tariffs,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement on the lawsuit.

The suit was filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade in Washington, D.C. 

It argues that a president has no authority to arbitrarily impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the U.S. law that Trump has cited in executing his tariff policy.

The civil complaint comes more than a week after a group of five small businesses filed a similar lawsuit against Trump in the same court, challenging the legality of the new tariffs on the same grounds.

On Tuesday, a three-judge panel in the court denied a motion by the plaintiffs in that case seeking a temporary restraining order that would suspend Trump's new tariffs pending the outcome of the case.

In addition to New York, the plaintiffs in the new lawsuit filed Wednesday include Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, and Vermont.

""Not once has any other President used IEEPA to impose tariffs. In the nearly five decades since IEEPA was enacted, no other President has imposed tariffs based on the existence of any national emergency, despite global anti-narcotics campaigns spearheaded by the United States and longstanding trade deficits,"" the states' suit says.

""Because these tariffs are unlawful, this Court should declare that they are not in force, enjoin the Defendant agencies and officers from enforcing them, and vacate the agency actions implementing them.""

CNBC has requested comment from the White House on the lawsuit.

Since taking office, Trump has issued a series of executive orders imposing a range of tariffs on foreign imports, including a 145% tariff on products made in China, and tariffs of 25% on products from Canada and Mexico. Imports from most of the other countries in the world were slapped with a 10% tariff by Trump.

""The Constitution assigns to Congress, not the President, the 'Power To lay andcollect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises,' "" the suit says.

""By claiming the authority to impose immense and ever-changing tariffs on whatever goods entering the United States he chooses, for whatever reason he finds convenient to declare an emergency, the President has upended the constitutional order and brought chaos to the American economy,"" the suit says.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said, ""President Trump's insane tariff scheme is not only economically reckless – it is illegal.""

""Arizona cannot afford President Trump's massive tax increase. No matter what the White House claims, tariffs are a tax that will be passed on to Arizona consumers,"" Mayes said.

Businesses dealing with the early stages of President Donald Trump's tariffs are looking for ways to pass increasing costs onto consumers, according to a Federal Reserve report Wednesday.

As Trump ordered against-the-board levies on U.S. imports and higher duties on Chinese products, the Fed's Beige Book indicated how they plan to proceed. Companies reported getting notices from suppliers about rising costs, and they looked to find ways not to absorb the increases while noting uncertainty over the ability to pass them along to customers.

""Most Districts noted that firms expected elevated input cost growth resulting from tariffs,"" the report said. ""Many firms have already received notices from suppliers that costs would be increasing.""

Broadly speaking, the report, which comes out about every seven weeks, characterized economic growth as ""little changed"" from the March 5 report, though it noted that ""uncertainty around international trade policy was pervasive across"" the Fed's 12 districts.

Prices generally rose during the period, which included Trump's April 2 ""liberation day"" announcement of the blanket tariffs. Employment was ""little changed"" amid falling headcounts in government jobs.

""Firms reported adding tariff surcharges or shortening pricing horizons to account for uncertain trade policy,"" the report stated. ""Most businesses expected to pass through additional costs to customers. However, there were reports about margin compression amid increased costs, as demand remained tepid in some sectors, especially for consumer-facing firms.""

In the New York area, firms reported rising prices particularly in food and insurance along with construction materials. Manufacturers and distributors said they already are adding surcharges due to shipments.

There also were signs of problems in the trade dispute with Canada. Tourists are booking fewer hotel rooms in New York City and at least one tech firm reported losing business contacts in Canada.

""The outlook for service sector firms worsened noticeably, with contacts anticipating a sharp decline in activity in the coming months. Service sector firms reported a major pullback in planned investment,"" the report said.

The report also noted the impact that the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency has had on employment in the Washington, D.C. region. DOGE has sought to pare back the federal workforce, laying off thousands and offering buyouts to others.

While the employment picture overall was ""unchanged"" for the period, ""many federal government workers were laid off or put on administrative leave in recent weeks.""

""These cuts to the federal workforce have impacted businesses throughout the entire district. In addition, federal contractors have laid off workers in response to spending cuts. For example, a research organization headquartered outside the DC-region laid off workers due to contracts being cancelled. Similarly, a Northern Virginia consultancy reduced headcount by 25 percent due to losing half their contracts,"" the report added.

Elsewhere in the report, service organizations dependent on government support noted difficulties since the White House began culling through agencies that get federal aid. The report specifically cited food banks in New York as seeing cuts in programs and personnel.

""Contacts at non-profits and other community-based organizations expressed significant concern about the future of federal funding and services support, creating challenges in staffing, strategy, and planning,"" the report said.

Discord co-founder and CEO Jason Citron is stepping down from the gaming-focused social messaging service, the startup said Wednesday.

Citron will be replaced by former Activision Blizzard Vice Chairman Humam Sakhnini, who will assume the reigns as Discord CEO and join the company's board on Monday. Citron will remain on Discord's board and become an advisor to the CEO, the company said.

In a public memo to employees, Citron said ""it feels like the right time"" to move on from the executive role and that the company has a ""clear strategy, new business lines to grow into, love and passion from our users, and an incredible team of people working tirelessly to deliver for them.""

""The job of a CEO is constantly evolving, and over the years I have continuously 'hired myself out of a job,'"" Citron wrote. ""Usually that means delegating work and then taking on different leadership challenges. However, as I look at what is needed of Discord's CEO over the next few years, I realize that it's time for me to literally 'hire myself out of a job.'""

Citron credited Sakhnini's 15-year experience in the video game industry as helping steer the startup he co-founded alongside Chief Technology Officer Stanislav Vishnevskiy in 2012, when it was initially a gaming studio before its 2015 pivot to online communications.

At Activision Blizzard, Sakhnini helped oversee major gaming franchises such as World of Warcraft, Call of Duty and Candy Crush, the company said. Vishnevskiy will remain Discord's CTO.

Discord's executive change comes amid media reports that it met with investment bankers to discuss a possible initial product offering as soon as this year. A Discord spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that it does ""not comment on rumors or speculation"" and that it is focused on ""delivering the best possible experience for our users and building a strong, sustainable business.""

A member of CNBC's Disruptor 50 list, Discord has roughly 200 million global monthly active users who access its ""servers"" to discuss shared interests using text, voice or video. Discord has raised a total of $1.1 billion and is valued at around $14.7 billion, according to PitchBook.

In this article

Meta has opened up its Threads microblogging service to all advertisers.

The social networking giant said Wednesday in a blog post that all ""eligible advertisers globally"" will be able to run ads on Threads, marking an expansion from the company's initial testing with a few U.S. and Japanese companies, which began in January.

Businesses running Threads ads can also access Meta's so-called inventory filter that determines whether their promotions appear near offensive content, Meta said in the blog post.

""These ads will be delivered in select markets at launch and will roll out to additional markets as we continue to test and learn,"" Meta said in the post.

Meta's testing of Threads ads represents the company's initial foray into generating revenue for its Twitter-like service that debuted in July 2023.

In January, Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said during a fourth-quarter earnings call with analysts that the company's ""introduction of ads on Threads will be gradual"" and executives ""don't anticipate it being a meaningful driver of overall impression or revenue growth in 2025.""

Analysts have previously noted that Threads could potentially be a major source of revenue for Meta, akin to X, formerly known as Twitter, before Tesla chief Elon Musk bought the social messaging platform in 2022. Twitter's annual sales were $5 billion in 2021.

Threads has more than 320 million monthly active users ""and has been adding more than 1 million sign-ups per day,"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told analysts in January.

""I expect Threads to continue on its trajectory to become the leading discussion platform and eventually reach 1 billion people over the next several years,"" Zuckerberg said at the time.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Institutions break up with Ethereum but keep ETH on the hook","https://www.tradingview.com/news/cointelegraph:8848a7329094b:0-institutions-break-up-with-ethereum-but-keep-eth-on-the-hook/","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 15:09:56 GMT","

Ethereum is entering one of its most precarious periods since its inception. Usage on the base layer is plummeting, core metrics are nearing multi-year lows, and even co-founder Vitalik Buterin is proposing a radical architectural overhaul. 

Institutions aren't waiting to see how it plays out. Blockchain data shows that long-time supporters such as Galaxy Digital and Paradigm have been slashing their Ether ETHUSD holdings in recent weeks. 

So far in April, Ethereum's base-layer activity has continued to collapse. Ethereum's network fees are dropping, and inflation has been rising. Though layer-2 networks continue to develop, they're cannibalizing the base layer's value capture.

But the story isn't entirely about Ethereum's collapse. Some whales are treating this downturn as a rare buying opportunity. Even those who are selling Ether can't fully let it go.

Ethereum gets dumped by institutions, but for how long?

Institutions are dumping Ethereum, but it's the ex they keep checking on. It's not entirely out of the picture — just benched while they explore options like Solana (SOL).

In recent weeks, blockchain analysts on the lookout for large crypto movements spotted several institutions moving ETH out of their tagged wallets, likely to sell. Lookonchain reported that Galaxy Digital deposited 65,600 ETH ($105.5 million) to Binance. The investment firm's Ether exposure rose to as high as around 98,000 coins in February, but that has dropped to almost 68,000 ETH at the time of writing, Arkham data shows.

Galaxy's holdings may have declined in recent weeks, but they're still higher compared to the start of the year. Its Ether holdings reflect a broader trend seen in Ethereum-based investment products. According to CoinShares, ETH funds saw $26.7 million in outflows over the past week, bringing total outflows to $772 million over eight weeks. However, year-to-date flows remain positive, with $215 million in net inflows. 

As Galaxy trimmed its Ether holdings, it also withdrew 752,240 SOL ($98.37 million), Lookonchain reported. Ethereum lost considerable momentum to Solana, which became the chain of choice during the memecoin casino frenzy that dominated much of 2024 and early 2025. While that eventually cooled amid rampant scams, bots and low-quality tokens, it also served as a technical showcase for Solana — proving its ability to process massive transaction volumes without major fee spikes or outages.

Paradigm is another investor that has cut back on Ether. On April 21, it moved 5,500 ETH ($8.66 million) to Anchorage Digital. Paradigm transferred around 97,000 ETH (around $301.57 million) to Anchorage from January 2024, which was then moved to centralized exchanges, as onchain analyst EmberCN pointed out.

“While institutional investors initially bought into the ‘ultra-sound money' narrative, they're now facing a reality where decreasing protocol revenue and weakening tokenomics create legitimate concerns,” Jayendra Jog, co-founder of Sei Labs, told Cointelegraph.

Ethereum returns to net inflationary state

Ether deflation has been an attractive selling point to Ethereum investors. It was integrated into the network through two major upgrades. First, the London hard fork of August 2021 introduced Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559, which partially burns transaction fees. Then in the Merge upgrade of September 2022, Ethereum became a proof-of-stake network and drastically cut new token issuance.

Ether's supply consistently decreased following the Merge until April 2024, when Ether's inflation began to accelerate. By early February 2025, the total ETH supply had surpassed its Merge level.



Part of Ether's inflation has been due to dropping fees, which results in less Ether burned. According to data from IntoTheBlock, Ethereum collected 1,873.52 ETH in fees from April 14 to April 21. That's slightly higher than the 1,697.61 ETH in fees from the week starting on March 17, which was the lowest amount of fees collected (measured in ETH) since July 31, 2017.



Buterin's radical RISC-V proposal for Ethereum

On April 20, Buterin proposed the RISC-V instruction set to substitute the current Ethereum Virtual Machine contract language, aiming to improve the speed and efficiency of the network's execution layer. Some view the proposal as a white flag on the existing architecture.

“Vitalik's RISC-V proposal is essentially an acknowledgment that the EVM's fundamental architecture has reached its limits. When Ethereum's founder proposes replacing the core VM that underpins the entire ecosystem, it signals not evolution but recognition of a design limitation that can't be incrementally improved,” Jog said.

Cointelegraph has reached out to the Ethereum Foundation and will update this article when it answers.

The proposal follows a leadership shuffling in the Ethereum Foundation following rising complaints on the project's direction. 

Could Ethereum be the one that got away?

Part of Ethereum's struggles has been attributed to its rollup-centric approach to scaling its network. The idea was to build layer-2 scaling networks that would offload the transactions from the base chain but still utilize its security. That has alleviated congestion issues during times of high network demand but has also created new problems of its own, such as dropping Ether burns and fragmentation of the Ethereum ecosystem.

But there is an increased focus on layer-1 scaling, according to Tomasz Stańczak, the new co-executive director of the Ethereum Foundation. Stańczak said on X that the Ethereum Foundation will shift its focus to near-term goals, such as layer-1 scaling and layer-2 scaling support.

Some whales have taken advantage of Ethereum's cheaper price tag. On April 23, Lookonchain identified two wallets accumulating millions of dollars worth of ETH. The blockchain monitor identified another wallet on April 22 that has accumulated over $100 million in ETH since Feb. 15. Ether is currently down from the plus-$4,000 it reached in December but rose over 10% on April 23 to over $1,800. 

In a recent client letter, Standard Chartered Bank slashed its 2025 price estimate for Ether from $10,000. However, for whales accumulating at current levels, upside potential remains, as the bank still predicts a year-end target of $4,000.

Geoff Kendrick, the bank's head of digital assets research, attributed the more cautious outlook to Ethereum's structural decline, noting that the layer-2 networks designed to improve scalability are now extracting much of the fee revenue once captured by the base layer.

Key Points

Investors continued to buy risk assets on Wednesday, including growth stocks, tech stocks, and cryptocurrencies, following a sharp move higher on Tuesday. And as highly correlated assets, it's no surprise they're all up in unison today.

The move in crypto is largely because of macroeconomic news, rather than anything about crypto itself. Bitcoin (BTC 2.79%) is up 2.9% since the stock market closed yesterday, Ethereum (ETH 5.70%) is up 5.1%, and Dogecoin (DOGE 4.11%) is up 6.2%.

The speculation today is that tariffs on imports from China will come down in short order after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expects a ""de-escalation"" in the trade war with China in the ""very near future."" 

It's the trade war that has caused concern that the U.S. will go into a recession, and that has caused a decline in Bitcoin and the market overall. But some of those concerns were alleviated today, at least according to the market's moves. 

If the trade war is indeed easing and the economy picks up later this year, it could be good for markets, including cryptocurrencies. But that continues to be uncertain given all that's happened in the past month.

What's notable about Bitcoin's move today is that it's correlated with growth and tech stocks, not a hedge against them. Gold, for contrast, is down 3.3% today and was up late last week and early this week when markets were crashing.

Bitcoin itself doesn't appear to be an inflation hedge, market hedge, or a store of value in volatile markets. It's acting like a risk asset, and that's how investors should expect it to trade.

While Bitcoin has become a clear risk asset, Ethereum and Dogecoin have more questions around them as the market determines where crypto assets are going long term. Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin by a wide margin despite more utility for the blockchain built over the last few years. That's because Ethereum hasn't improved its speed or cost of transactions, as blockchains like Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) take market share because of their speed and low costs.

Dogecoin was the first meme coin, but buying memes is only fun when the market is going up. Dogecoin is down over 50% since post-election highs and is still well below 2021 highs hit during the peak of the market frenzy. Dogecoin will continue to trade like a risk asset, but it's hard to see its fundamentals improving without a real use case for the token.

I see moves like today's as another sign that the crypto market will continue to be extremely volatile and trade along with assets like growth stocks. But unlike growth stocks, there's less fundamental value behind these tokens.

Bitcoin's argument for being a store of value hasn't proven to be true after falling after tariffs were announced earlier this month. And if inflation spikes, we will likely see Bitcoin fall again.

Ethereum and Dogecoin continue to have mind share, but as developers and businesses are looking for more use cases for the blockchain they may lose favor. Today's move looks like a temporary bounce for Ethereum's and Dogecoin's declining fortunes long term.

Is the latest rally enough to shift Ethereum price prediction, or do lingering dominance lows and macro risk still cap how far ETH can realistically go?

After several weeks of sluggish price action, Ethereum (ETH) is finally showing signs of a meaningful recovery. The second-largest crypto by market cap recently climbed past $1,800, staging a sharp rebound from its Apr. 9 low, when it briefly dipped below $1,400.

That earlier drop was partly triggered by market unease over President Trump's tariff-driven economic stance, which had weighed on risk assets.

Since then, ETH has rallied more than 26%, breaking decisively out of the narrow $1,500 to $1,600 range where it had remained stuck for much of the month. As of April 23, Ethereum is trading near $1,790, gaining over 10% in just the past 24 hours.

The broader crypto market is also turning more optimistic, with Bitcoin (BTC) trading close to $92,500 and the total market cap nearing the $3 trillion mark.

On-chain data reflects a return of deep-pocketed players. One whale recently borrowed $34.75 million in Tether (USDT) from Aave (AAVE) and used those funds to purchase nearly 20,000 ETH at an average entry of $1,740.

As $ETH rebounded, a whale borrowed 34.75M $USDT from #Aave to buy 19,973 $ETH at ~$1,740 just 4 hours ago.This whale now collateralizes 50K $WETH ($89.8M) on #Aave to borrow 65.85M $USDT at a health rate of 1.12 and a liquidation price of $1,549.5.Follow @spotonchain and… pic.twitter.com/OBaDukqfAm

The same entity has now deposited 50,000 Wrapped Ethereum (WETH), valued at approximately $89.8 million, as collateral to borrow over $65 million more. 

The liquidation threshold for this position sits around $1,549, suggesting a carefully hedged bet built on short- to medium-term conviction.

Institutional signals are beginning to follow. On April 22, U.S.-listed Ethereum ETFs saw net inflows of $38.74 million, breaking a 10-day streak of flat or negative flows. Fidelity's FETH led the activity with $32.65 million in inflows, followed by Bitwise's ETHW with $6.09 million. 

These inflows marked the highest single-day intake for Ethereum funds since early February and came after eight straight weeks of persistent outflows, which had totaled nearly $910 million. In total, Ethereum-focused ETFs have now accumulated approximately $2.26 billion in inflows since their respective launches.

With both market structure and institutional behavior beginning to shift, let's examine what's happening across Ethereum's ecosystem, and where Ethereum price prediction could head in the coming days.

Ethereum's technical foundations may soon undergo a profound transformation, following a new proposal by co-founder Vitalik Buterin.

On Apr. 20, Buterin introduced the idea of replacing the Ethereum Virtual Machine with RISC-V, an open-source computing architecture known for its modularity and built-in encryption support.

The EVM has long served as the backbone of Ethereum's smart contract functionality. It enables developers to deploy decentralized applications and has been central to Ethereum's broad compatibility with other blockchains and layer-2 networks. 

Popular ecosystems such as Coinbase's Base chain rely heavily on EVM standards to enable cross-chain operations and support developer migration.

Buterin's proposal suggests that switching to RISC-V could streamline Ethereum's execution layer—the part of the network that processes and executes smart contract code.

While the EVM has proven reliable, it is increasingly seen as a bottleneck for Ethereum's scalability. Adopting a more modern and adaptable architecture like RISC-V, according to Buterin, could enhance processing efficiency and reduce resource demands on the network.

One of RISC-V's key strengths lies in its native support for encryption functions. This allows Ethereum to potentially avoid the complexity of ongoing efforts to reconfigure the EVM around zero-knowledge proofs. 

While zero-knowledge systems promise enhanced privacy and scalability, they often require significant computational power and development overhead. RISC-V's built-in capabilities may offer a more direct and lightweight alternative.

Buterin also pointed out that RISC-V has already shown promise in other blockchain environments, including small-scale implementations on platforms like Polkadot (DOT). 

In certain use cases, performance could improve by more than a hundredfold if Ethereum were to integrate RISC-V at the protocol level. These gains could help address persistent concerns over gas fees and network congestion, both of which remain barriers to everyday use and mainstream adoption.

The proposal comes at a crucial moment. Ethereum's transaction volumes have declined, and ETH's price performance has lagged behind broader market trends. Earlier this year, the Ethereum Foundation underwent a leadership change aimed at reorienting the project's strategic direction. 

Ethereum's recent price recovery is beginning to attract attention, but the rally remains in a fragile phase from a technical perspective. At the time of writing, ETH is trading just under the $1,800 mark, marking a steady climb from earlier lows.

Despite this rebound, Ethereum is still trading below key long-term resistance levels. The 50-day simple moving average stands at $1,830, while the 100-day sits much higher at $2,342. Both remain above the current price, signaling that ETH has yet to fully exit its broader downtrend and reclaim upward momentum on a longer time frame.

On the short-term side, ETH is showing healthier signals. The 5-day and 10-day moving averages have moved to $1,709 and $1,660, both now sitting below the current price, a typical early indicator of a bullish shift. 

The Relative Strength Index is hovering near 56.5, reflecting neutral territory, not yet in overbought or oversold conditions. This suggests there's still room for further price movement in either direction without immediate exhaustion.

Momentum indicators remain more cautious. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), currently at 38, signals a neutral trend. It does not yet point to a strong directional shift, implying that market participants are still weighing macro cues and short-term signals.

Support levels are holding firm at $1,623, $1,490, and $1,422. These price points provide a safety net if the market sees a near-term correction. On the upside, resistance lies at $1,824, followed by $1,892 and $2,025. 

These thresholds will likely serve as key decision points for traders looking to determine whether the current move has lasting strength or is merely a temporary relief rally. A sustained breakout above the $1,900 level would be a clearer signal of broader market confidence returning.

Ethereum's recent bounce has sparked a wave of optimism, with several analysts suggesting that the recovery may finally be gaining structure.

A pseudonymous analyst named Incognito, posting on TradingView, sees a classic setup forming a “falling wedge” pattern, which often precedes a bullish breakout. 

According to him, Ethereum looks like it's nearing the final stages of a Wyckoff accumulation phase, a framework used to map how assets transition from sell-offs to new uptrends. 

If that plays out, his chart suggests an initial move toward $2,499, and possibly as high as $2,700. A similar note came from trader Christiaan on X, who shared a near-term target of $2,690. 

$ETH Send it ✅ pic.twitter.com/HUOkSrRTQZ

Both analysts are optimistic that Ethereum may be ready to climb, but only if short-term support stays intact. Any dip back into the previous range could invalidate the setup altogether.

Meanwhile, Rekt Capital is approaching it from a broader lens, not price, but dominance. ETH dominance, which tracks Ethereum's market cap relative to the rest of crypto, recently hit new lows. But it's still holding above its 2019 base, and that matters.

$ETH DominanceSince dropped to new All Time Lows, Ethereum Dominance has managed to protect 2019 All Time Lows as support (black) for nowETH Dominance needs to Monthly Close inside green so as to develop a reversal base like back in 2019-2020#ETH #Crypto #Ethereum https://t.co/Ubh8iDpx6j pic.twitter.com/3DXw4udWa2

According to him, if Ethereum can close the month inside the green support band on his chart, it could be repeating the kind of bottom formation that led to the multi-month rally between 2019 and 2020.

Another angle comes from Michaël van de Poppe, who sees a bullish divergence starting to take shape. That's when price prints lower lows but momentum indicators like RSI show higher lows—often a subtle clue that selling pressure is fading.

A clear bullish divergence on $ETH signalling there's more to come.It breaks back in the lower timeframe range, indicating that we're having more in the tank.Level to hold: 1850 sats.If that holds and $ETH prints HLs, it's likely that we'll start an uptrend. pic.twitter.com/1dQJvqEUy2

Van de Poppe added that if Ethereum holds 1,850 sats against Bitcoin and starts to form higher lows, there's a good chance it could enter a fresh uptrend from here.

Still, these are signals, not certainties. Technical analysis can help identify potential shifts in sentiment, but charts don't account for sudden macro shocks.

As always, risk management matters. Whether ETH pushes higher or stalls again will depend on how the market handles upcoming resistance zones and whether confidence builds fast enough to carry it through. Trade wisely, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Vignesh is a young journalist with a decade of experience. A proud alumnus of IIJNM, Bengaluru, he spent six years as a Sub-Editor for a leading business magazine, published from Kerala. His interest in futuristic technologies took him to a US-based software company specialising in Web3, Blockchain and AI. This stint inspired him to view the future of journalism through the lens of next generation technologies. Now, he covers the crypto scene for Coinpedia, uncovering a vibrant new world where technology and journalism converge.

The cryptocurrency market has experienced a significant 24-hour surge of 4.7%, led by substantial gains in major altcoins.

The altcoin market is recovering strongly after an early April dip, with its market cap increasing by 17.57% since April 9th.

Analyst Miles Deutscher suggests focusing on oversold coins, strong narratives, upcoming catalysts, and technical indicators to identify the next altcoin pumps.

The crypto market is heating up again. In the past 24 hours, the total market cap has climbed by 4.7%, with altcoins taking the lead. Major tokens like Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin are posting strong gains, catching the attention of both traders and analysts.

Behind the scenes, market dynamics are shifting, and one well-known analyst has just revealed a simple formula for spotting which altcoins might be next to explode.

Read on.

Ethereum is up 10.1%, XRP has gained 8.3%, and Solana has moved up by 8.4%. Dogecoin leads the pack with an 11.3% jump, followed closely by Cardano, up 10%, Avalanche rising 13.2%, Chainlink with an 11.6% boost, and Stellar gaining 10.2%.

This wave of bullish momentum across altcoins has sparked a fresh sense of optimism in the market. Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher has weighed in with a breakdown of how to identify which altcoins could be next to rally.

These are the altcoins that will pump the hardest:• Heavily shorted/oversold• Strong underlying narrative• New/upcoming catalyst(s)• Momentum indicator (i.e. MA) + HTF S/R flip confluence Take notes and prep your watchlists. I've already pulled the trigger on multiple.

The total crypto market cap was $2.63 trillion at the start of April but dropped to $2.31 trillion by April 7. Since then, however, the market has bounced back by over 20.92%.

Altcoins are following the same pattern. After falling to $831.83 billion earlier this month, the altcoin market has now recovered by 17.57%, reaching $1.03 trillion. Over the last three days alone, it has grown by 7.67%.

Bitcoin started April with a dominance level of 62.30%, which peaked at 64.59% before slightly falling to 64.31%. This slight dip shows that altcoins are starting to gain ground as some capital shifts away from Bitcoin.

Historically, a drop in Bitcoin dominance often signals growing interest and inflow into altcoins. Traders are now watching closely to see if this trend continues.

As interest in altcoins rises, analyst Miles Deutscher has revealed a simple but powerful framework for identifying coins that could be ready for a breakout. According to him, there are four main factors to look for:

With Bitcoin dominance easing and altcoins showing signs of recovery, many analysts believe the current rally may only be the beginning.

Kyle Kemper, half-brother of former prime minister Justin Trudeau, is warning Canadians that Liberal Leader Mark Carney would push for a national central bank digital currency (CBDC).

In a video shared on Twitter/X on Wednesday, Kemper brands Carney “the CBDC candidate” and claims the former central banker is acting for elite groups such as the Bilderberg Group and World Economic Forum. 

Kemper tells viewers a digital loonie would be “fully tracked, fully centralized” and could reward citizens for obedience while punishing dissent.

“People don't understand how dangerous a CBDC is,” said Kemper.

Kemper pointed out that President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order banning an American CBDC and argues Canada should do the same.

Kemper has been warning Canada about Carney, including telling the Western Standard that Carney's policies are the exact opposite of what Canada needs, particularly Carney's economic policies.

Carney, sworn in as Liberal leader last month, has not responded publicly to Kemper's remarks. 

On the campaign trail this week, Carney emphasized the need for a modern payments system but has stopped short of committing to a timeline for any digital dollar.

Central bank digital currencies are being tested or studied in more than 100 countries, including China and the European Union. 

The Bank of Canada continues internal research but says no decision will be made without public consultation and parliamentary approval.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has promised to block a CBDC if his party wins the federal election, saying it would give Ottawa too much control over personal finances.  

The CBDC issue adds a crypto controversy to an already volatile campaign defined by trade tensions and energy security.

They call him “El Presidente.” But unlike the other President, Dave Portnoy draws a line at launching a memecoin. He worries his followers will lose their shirts.

“I got involved in memecoins because I wanted to launch a Barstool memecoin, but I didn't want my fans and followers to lose money,” he said in an interview with CoinDesk. Memecoins are “legalized Ponzi schemes,” he said, “there's no value to it, so you gotta get in and get out before it crashes.” [Note: memecoins aren't legalized in the U.S. but they are popular.]

While Portnoy hasn't launched a Barstool branded memecoin, he has launched other memecoins. In February he launched GREED, a token that reached a market cap of $41.5 million. According to Lookonchain, Portnoy bought 357.92M $GREED, totalling 35.79% of the total supply, then sold all in a single transaction causing the price to crash. He made around $258,000.

The Barstool Sports founder took to X in the aftermath to say, “I warned people I could sell. I could have cashed out +1 million. I let it drop 75% before cashing out. Lots of people made money. I took profits + poured it into #jailstool which I can't touch. I didn't make a dime on it. Some people won. Some lost. Only the losers keep bitching.”

Portnoy started trading stocks during the COVID-19 pandemic, and even launched the YouTube channel Davey Day Trader, where fans could follow his trades. His trades weren't always successful, and there wasn't always a clear strategy, but they were entertaining. At one point, he pulled letters out of a Scrabble bag, put RTX (Raytheon Technologies Corporation) together, and put $200,000 into the stock.

It was around this time that Portnoy was introduced to bitcoin. “I don't think you can be involved in anything, stock market [or] finance without crypto being a major part of it,” he says now. He has a love/hate relationship with bitcoin because he says he's “been on the wrong side of it every time it rips.” Over the years he's also experimented with investing in cryptocurrencies like XRP.

Although Portnoy got into memecoins because he wanted to launch one for the Barstool community, he admits that he still doesn't understand how to implement blockchain technology or cryptocurrencies into his business model. Barstool once accepted bitcoin as part of its Barstool Fund to help small businesses, but out of $50 million raised, he said only $30,000 came from bitcoin. 

“They talked big, big talk, but it didn't work out,” he said, reflecting on the bitcoin community who persuaded him to accept the cryptocurrency. “Crypto is the league leader in people telling you what [you] should be doing, and it's also the league leader in people I don't trust.”

Portnoy has experimented with memecoins, bitcoin, and even launched an NFT attached to his popular One Bite Pizza Reviews YouTube channel that sold for $138,000. And, although he doesn't always understand them, he says “as much as I have back and forth with the crypto community, I actually love them. I think they're hilarious [...] an interesting group, which I guess I'm a part of.”Dave Portnoy will be sharing more about his crypto journey at Consensus 2025 in Toronto on May 15.

 Cointelegraph speaks with James Check on why Bitcoin's future lies beyond four-year cycles, and how onchain data reveals what really matters. 

For years, crypto investors have looked to the four-year cycle, anchored around Bitcoin's halving events, as a kind of sacred roadmap. The theory goes: Every four years, Bitcoin's supply is cut in half, triggering a bullish frenzy, followed by a euphoric peak, a brutal crash, and then a slow recovery. Rinse, repeat.

But what if that model is starting to break? That is what onchain analyst James Check suggests. 

In an interview with Cointelegraph, Check said that the tidy frameworks that once defined Bitcoin's market behavior are no longer as useful in today's macro-driven, institutionally influenced environment.

Rather than labeling the current market as “bull” or “bear,” Check paints a more nuanced picture. Bitcoin, he argues, is now driven more by macroeconomic conditions and investor psychology than by predictable cycles or halving dates. As such, the lines between bull and bear get blurry.

“The world doesn't operate on four-year cycles,” he says. “You can imagine a headline tomorrow where suddenly all these tariffs get pulled back […] and markets start to move. I can just as easily construct a case where the next headline could send all risk assets into a pretty nasty decline.”

Check also breaks down why the $70K–$75K range is such a critical confidence zone for the Bitcoin market — and how thinking in terms of scenarios rather than predictions is key for an investor's long-term success.

Misunderstood and Maligned Snakes Are Worthy Of Our Sympathy

 In a new book called Slither, Stephen S. Hall takes a deep dive into the biology and history of one of the most reviled animals.

By Rachel Feltman, Stephen S. Hall, Fonda Mwangi, Alex Sugiura & Naeem Amarsy 

Fonda Mwangi, Naeem Amarsy/Scientific American

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. 

People are funny about snakes. I remember being taught the rhyme, “Red touches black, you're okay, Jack; red touches yellow, you're a dead fellow,” in elementary school—never mind the fact that we did not have coral snakes in New Jersey. 

My guest today has spent a lot of time exploring our cultural aversion to—and fascination with—snakes. Stephen S. Hall is a science writer and the author of seven books. He's also a teacher of science communication at New York University, Rockefeller University and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. His latest book, Slither: How Nature's Most Maligned Creatures Illuminate Our World, is on sale now.

Thank you so much for coming in to chat. I'm really looking forward to it.

Stephen S. Hall: My pleasure to be here. Thank you.

Feltman: First question: Why snakes?

Hall: There's several answers to that question. One of them is that as a kid, like many kids, I caught snakes, brought them home, put them in terrariums in the garage until my mother screamed when they would get loose, and that sort of ended that experiment. I was always fascinated by them because they were so different from other animals—and also so beautiful. There was a real fascination and attraction there. But I wasn't a herper; I didn't go out and continue to collect snakes.

What I did do is become a science writer, and probably in the 2000s and 2010s, when I was reading science journals like Science and Nature, I occasionally would run across these really interesting major research articles based on snakes, and I always sort of set them aside, thinking, “This is kind of interesting. I should gather a little pile on this.”

The third piece of this explanation is that my agent suggested at one point, “Why don't you do a book about an animal?” which I had never done before. And my first reaction was, “I'd only do a book about an animal that most people don't like,” because I thought it'd be a really interesting challenge to try to change people's minds. And as most people know snakes are not very popular. People do not like them—they're afraid of them; they loathe them; there're all these surveys that children detest snakes and adults detest snakes—and I thought it would be an interesting challenge to try to change people's minds about a really interesting creature. 

Feltman: Very cool. Given your research for the book, how have our feelings about snakes evolved over time?

Hall: One of the things that surprised me is: this deeply embedded loathing of snakes was not always the case. In fact, that was the later evolution from earlier cultures, and part of the fun of doing Slither was going back and seeing how ancient cultures perceive snakes, and they perceived them very differently.

They were respected. They were venerated in some cultures. In, in early ancient Greek culture the snake was associated with healing. In Mesoamerican cultures the snake was associated with a kind of messenger that would go back and forth between humans and nature but also humans and the afterworld—the world of the nonliving, as it were. There was a great respect for these creatures. This was also true in ancient Egypt. And then [laughs] with the Garden of Eden story the snake got demonized and was blamed for human fallibility, human sin, and I think that changed a lot of perceptions.

One of the goals that I was trying to accomplish here was to get people to rethink what snakes represent: Why did ancient people venerate them, and is there a way to reclaim that sense of respect for these otherwise disliked creatures?

Feltman: Well, and what do you think it is about snakes that made them venerated, and what do you think it is about them that makes people feel so negatively towards them?

Hall: In terms of the negative part they are so different from so many other creatures: They don't have legs. They're secretive. You can't see them. They're [laughs] extremely good at hiding. In fact, you know, there—it's sort of a Darwinian badge of honor that they make themselves hard to see, with their camouflage skin, and coloration, and so on. So they represent a kind of extreme version of the other. And people also associate threat and danger with them, certainly with venomous snakes.

One of the interesting things that came up in the research—it's a really interesting theory called the snake-detection theory. This is advanced by a researcher at the University of California, Davis, named Lynne Isbell. Isbell argues that the necessity of spotting snakes in the wild as a self-preservation mechanism led to the creation of a much larger primate brain, which we humans have inherited as well. So she attributes human acuity in vision to spotting snakes in [an] evolutionary sense that was developed a long time ago.

Feltman: Yeah, I've also seen that as an explanation for why cats are freaked out by cucumbers; I'll have to fact-check that. But that's not [laughs] anything I've—I've heard that theory brought up before in the context of cats running away from cucumbers [laughs], so.

Hall: There's some ingrained perception.

Charles Darwin read a report by a German scientist—this is in the middle of the 19th century—that he had taken snakes to the monkey house in a zoo in Germany, and the monkeys went crazy just seeing that there was a snake in it when he revealed it. So Darwin puts a stuffed snake in a bag and goes to the London Zoo, and then he takes off the top, and all the monkeys go crazy, and he'd never seen a reaction like that. Then he went back with a live snake, and the same thing happened, and it was this sort of instantaneous reaction to the appearance of a snake, so there's definitely an alarm system ...

Feltman: Mm.

Hall: We don't need to say that it was fear, necessarily, although some people call it a “fear module,” but there's an alarm system in spotting a snake that I think is connected to the alarm that many humans feel when they see a snake.

Feltman: Sure, and speaking of Darwin's kind of crude research, how has our scientific understanding of snakes changed over time?

Hall: Scientists are belatedly using snakes as a nontraditional model organism.

Feltman: Mm.

Hall: You would think that there was not much you could learn from a snake, but they've actually discovered some remarkable qualities in snakes because they finally started paying attention to them with the advent of molecular biology. What used to be observed naturalistically—okay, a snake eats a large prey and digests it—and they would take x-rays of it, like, in the 1970s; that was how metabolism was explained. After genomics emerged and they did the genome of the snake after the Human Genome Project, they discovered that snakes, pythons, as a model organism activate a huge suite of genes from the moment that they have a meal. And they were particularly interesting organisms to study because—I facetiously kinda say they invented intermittent fasting [laughs]—but, but they could go for a year at a time without eating a single meal. And then they eat these enormous meals. So the equivalence was, like, a 150-pound human, for example, roughly, eating a 220-pound hamburger ...

Feltman: Mm [laughs].

Hall: “In one gulp.” That's kind of what the meal of a python was like. How does an animal handle the digestion and processing of that? It turns out they activate all these genes that regenerate tissues in the body—a bigger heart, a bigger intestine—just to handle the [laughs] massive processing of this meal. And then they carve away all the regenerated tissue that they've created and go back to normal. So they have this ability to regenerate tissue, which, of course, is something we can't do, except in a couple of isolated cases, and it became a really interesting thing to study.

Another thing that's really interesting is convergent evolution: this idea that animals can evolve the same traits, although they're completely unrelated. So there was a study that came out a couple years ago on spitting cobras. The researchers established that three different lineages of cobras that were completely independent of each other each evolved the anatomical mechanism to spit venom—a physiological change. They evolved the behavior to aim the spit at the eyes of whatever it was that was threatening them.

Feltman: Wow.

Hall: And they independently evolved a change in their venom that produced excruciating pain in eyes. So independently all three of those different qualities were evolved in three different species of snakes that were completely unrelated to each other, in a sense. You couldn't have found that out until you had genomics and very sophisticated molecular analysis of venom and all that stuff.

Feltman: Yeah. What were some of the most surprising things that you learned in this project as someone who already really had a fondness for snakes?

Hall: The thing that really impressed me is how adaptive snakes are, how rapidly they adjust to their environment; it's one of their signal traits. They're very diverse—it's amazing that they can live on every continent except Antarctica, which means temperate, cold weather, tropical weather, jungle, seawater. If there's a threat in the environment, they have these remarkably ingenious evolutionary adaptations to it. There's a story of these sea snakes in, in the Pacific off New Caledonia that, in response to the pollution in the waters there, have developed melanistic characteristics—a darker coloration in their skin—because that sequesters all these toxic chemicals that are in the water and prevents it from harming the animal, and then they slough off their skin and they get rid of the chemicals. And it's only in those snakes that are inhabiting that particular niche.

This idea of being able to adapt to environmental challenge really struck me, not just because of the cleverness of the evolution or the selective process, but also, it's a warning to us in terms of climate change and changes in the global meteorological systems. Snakes have a way of adapting to this that we don't have, and maybe we can learn something from them. It's really interesting that in the Mesoamerican cultures in particular, snakes were traditionally associated with meteorological events ...

Feltman: Mm.

Hall: So rain, lightning, thunderstorms, droughts, floods, and all of that being attached to agricultural fertility. And these are all issues that are front and center now because of climate change, and I think the ancients realized that snakes were symbols of coming to terms with both the unpredictability of nature and perhaps suggesting ways to adapt to it.

I spoke to a very well-known Australian herpetologist named Rick Shine. He did fieldwork in [the mountains of] Tasmania, which has horrible weather, and there are snakes there, and, you know, he said there's only 20 or 30 really nice sunny days there. And humans go there, and they think, “This is the most god-awful environment. How could anything live here?” And the snakes live under the rocks for all but those 20 or 30 days, and then they come out, and they think they're living in the villa by the sea [laughs], and it's just, it's a sunny day for them; they don't have the sense that it's a bad environment because they adjust to it. And he had this wonderful observation—he just wondered what it felt like for a snake to emerge into the sunlight, warm up, have all its organ systems click on, its consciousness click on. He said, “That must be an amazing feeling.” And I thought that was a wonderful way of kind of capturing the uniqueness of these creatures.

Feltman: Yeah, well, and speaking of that adaptation, what dangers are snakes facing these days?

Hall: I would say the biggest danger's habitat destruction. And there are a couple of anecdotes in the book—so I talk about when I caught snakes as a kid, and this was in a sort of exurban area of Michigan, outside Detroit. I went back to that area 50 years later to see how the habitat had changed, and all the places where you would catch turtles or you catch snakes or you would see them, it's all changed: It's been developed residentially. Population spread has confined the habitat.

Thomas Cole, who's a pretty famous Hudson River School painter, had made the point that a habitat destruction was something that needed to be addressed or, as he put it, we would lose Eden and wouldn't be able to recover it again.

Feltman: Why do you think people should care about snakes?

Hall: I think it's really important, when we talk about conservation, preservation of species, prevention of extinction, that we don't only think about cute animals that everybody likes. It's really important to globally embrace all creatures—including, in this case, that animal that is so different and so repulsive and historically so loathed by so many people—because if we pick and choose, we're really not saving anything in terms of habitat or anything else.

And it's an acknowledgement that ecologies are complicated, that there are these very fragile webs, and it's not just birds or mammals or snakes, but it's the combination and interaction of these creatures that creates a vibrant and sustainable ecology. It's really important to include everyone in our conservation arc, if you will.

Feltman: Absolutely. Steve, thank you so much for coming on to talk to us, and I'm sure our listeners are really gonna love your book.

Hall: Thank you very much for having me.

Lion Bite to the Butt May Be First Proof of Human-Animal Gladiatorial Combat

The first physical evidence of Roman gladiators fighting animals has been found in skeletal remains from England

Roman gladiators' fights to the death have inspired morbid fascination for millennia. But for something seemingly so well-documented, it's rare for archaeologists find physical evidence of such combat in the form of Roman gladiators' remains. Most of what we know about the fights comes from indirect records, such as texts or illustrations that described the bloody, raucous events. Among such records, some depicted so-called beast hunts, in which gladiators were pitted against predators that included lions, tigers and even elephants.

Now archaeologists have found the first physical evidence of a gladiator locked in combat with one of these animals—which appears to have left a huge, lion-sized bite mark on the fighter's butt. The findings were published on Wednesday in PLOS One.

Tim Thompson, a forensic anthropologist at Maynooth University in Ireland, spends a lot of time examining the disfigured skeletons of people who died long ago. Around 2017 he was studying human remains uncovered during a 2004 excavation of Driffield Terrace—a site in York, England, that evidence suggests was a gladiator burial ground during the Roman Empire. Thompson and his colleagues were quickly drawn to a skeleton that sported a weirdly shaped bite marks on its pelvis.

When the bones were first unearthed, archaeologists wouldn't have had the technology to probe the intriguing marks much further. Thompson and his team wanted to know what caused them—and now had the laboratory techniques to find out. They collaborated with zoos to create three-dimensional scans of bite marks on leftover carcasses that were made by types of animals, such as lions and cheetahs, that had been used in Roman gladiatorial shows.

They also chemically analyzed the ancient Roman bones to confirm other traits, such as the deceased person's sex and nutritional condition—clues that could help determine whether this skeleton could truly have come from a Roman Empire–era gladiator. The researchers say they were also able to estimate that the injury's timing was roughly concurrent with that of the fighter's death.

The team compared the scans of the modern carnivore bites to those on the ancient bones. The likely culprit of the latter: a lion. Marble artifacts from Roman Britain depict lions mauling gladiators, Thompson says, but no confirmed archaeological evidence had been found. Some experts have also speculated that if this human-animal combat indeed occurred, it only happened in Rome—not in the far-flung edges of the empire. “The assumption has always been that maybe that [artifacts from Roman Britain] are just reflections of things happening in Rome, almost tapping into Roman myth,” Thompson says. “What we're suggesting now, actually, is that we have evidence for that spectacle happening [here in York].”

The new finding not only offers fascinating clues into the culture of gladiatorial combat but also highlights the astonishingly far-reaching influence of the Roman Empire. “This was one of the key ways that Roman culture was spread—a spectacle,” says Anna Osterholtz, a bioarchaeologist at Mississippi State University, who was not involved in the new study. “Because you would also have executions that would be taking place as part of the games, it taught things like social roles and social norms.”

Kathryn Marklein, a biological anthropologist at the University of Louisville, who was also not involved in the study, points to the exorbitant cost these fights would have incurred. Lions are not native to England, so it would have required considerable expense and effort to bring the animals all the way to York. “Putting this quantity of resources into an event is a testament to the importance of violent spectacles in Roman provinces,” Marklein says.

Skeletal remains can reveal a great deal about pieces of human history that would otherwise be lost to time. “Our lives are inscribed into our bones,” Osterholtz says. These remains can tell us about “people's lives that weren't considered important enough to be written down, that were never part of the official record.”

With the assumption that students are going to use artificial intelligence and large language models such as ChatGPT to do their homework, researchers in the Department of Aerospace Engineering in The Grainger College of Engineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign set out to learn how well the free version of ChatGPT would compare with human students in a semester-long undergraduate control systems course.

The results: On straightforward math homework, ChatGPT got an A, but with some quirky answers. However, on higher-level problems that require reasoning, it got a D.

""We found ChatGPT technology can get an A on structured, straightforward questions. On open-ended questions it got a 62, brining ChatGPT's semester grade down to an 82, a low B. The class average for the human students was 84.85 percent because they could handle the problems that required higher-level reasoning,"" said Ph.D. student Gokul Puthumanaillam.

The study concludes that a student who puts in minimal effort, showing no effort to learn the material, could use ChatGPT exclusively, get a B and pass the course. The problem is the passing grade might be the combination of A+ in simple math and D- in analysis. They haven't learned much.

""Like calculators in math classes, ChatGPT is a tool that's here to stay and that students will use. What the results of this study pointed out to me is that I need to adjust as an educator,"" said Puthumanaillam's advisor Melkior Ornik. ""I plan to consider how I design my courses so that, over time, I include more higher-level questions, perhaps including project-based assignments. Students will still use programs like ChatGPT to do the simpler math problems, but by adding more open-ended questions, they'll also reach a higher level of critical thinking and truly learn the material.""

Puthumanaillam said although ChatGPT is fast and mostly correct on structured questions, it's wise to use it with caution.

""A student might take 20 minutes to answer a question. ChatGPT solves it in less than 20 seconds, but the correctness is sometimes questionable.""

He also described examples of strange behavior from ChatGPT's homework such as using inappropriate technical jargon and saying things that were simply not true.

""Despite the fact that we provided all of the course material needed to ChatGPT, it still hallucinated, using words like quasi periodic oscillations that were never used in the class, in the lectures or course materials.""

The study considered the type of student who chooses to put in minimal effort. Puthumanaillam said the premium version of ChatGPT may be slightly more capable of solving the analytical questions and can store more memory to solve longer, more complex problems. The researchers chose to use the free version of the software because the average student probably wouldn't want to spend the monthly fee.

Puthumanaillam noted that there were no team assignments in the course, the ChatGPT prompts used the exact language as the human students received, and it was all conducted synchronously.

""When the students were doing their homework, ChatGPT was also doing the homework. ChatGPT was just an extra student in the class.""

Did ChatGPT learn from its mistakes?

""When we told ChatGPT it was wrong on a multiple-choice question, gave it the correct option, then a variation of the same question, yes, it did better. In a sense, it was learning but overall, it was stagnant. If it scored 90 percent in homework, it ended up scoring 90 or 92 at the conclusion of the semester.""

This work was supported by the Grants for Advancement of Teaching in Engineering program at The Grainger College of Engineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Aerospace Professor Tim Bretl, along with Ph.D. students Grayson Schaer and Pranay Thangeda, created the project environments, developed course materials and the PrairieLearn infrastructure.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Engineer reinvents ceramics with origami-inspired 3D printing","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/04/250423130331.htm","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 19:30:30 GMT","

In a breakthrough that blends ancient design with modern materials science, researchers at the University of Houston have developed a new class of ceramic structures that can bend under pressure -- without breaking.

Potential applications for this technology range from medical prosthetics to impact-resistant components in aerospace and robotics, where lightweight -- but tough -- materials are in high demand.

Traditionally known for their brittleness, ceramics often shatter under stress, making them difficult to use in high-impact or adaptive applications. But that may soon change as a team of UH researchers, led by Maksud Rahman, assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and Md Shajedul Hoque Thakur, postdoctoral fellow, has shown that origami-inspired shapes with a soft polymer coating can transform fragile ceramic materials into tough, flexible structures. Their work was recently published in Advanced Composites and Hybrid Materials.

""Ceramics are incredibly useful -- biocompatible, lightweight and durable in the right conditions -- but they fail catastrophically,"" said Rahman. ""Our goal was to engineer that failure into something more graceful and safer.""

To do that, the team 3D printed a ceramic structure based on the Miura-ori origami pattern -- which is a way to fold something flat, like paper, so it takes up less space but stays flat overall -- and then coated it with a stretchable, biocompatible polymer. The resulting structures can handle stress in ways ordinary ceramics cannot. When compressed in different directions, the coated structures flexed and recovered, while their uncoated counterparts cracked or broke.

""The origami geometry gave us mechanical adaptability,"" said Thakur. ""And the polymer coating introduced just enough flexibility to prevent sudden breakage.""

The researchers tested the structures under both static and cyclic compression and backed up their experiments with computer simulations. The coated versions consistently showed greater toughness -- especially in directions where the original ceramic was weakest.

""Origami is more than an art -- it's a powerful design tool that can reshape how we approach challenges in both biomedical and engineering fields,"" said Rahman. ""This work demonstrates how folding patterns can unlock new functionalities in even the most fragile materials.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Engineers print synthetic 'metamaterials' that are both strong and stretchy","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/04/250423112135.htm","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 17:45:37 GMT","

In metamaterials design, the name of the game has long been ""stronger is better.""

Metamaterials are synthetic materials with microscopic structures that give the overall material exceptional properties. A huge focus has been in designing metamaterials that are stronger and stiffer than their conventional counterparts. But there's a trade-off: The stiffer a material, the less flexible it is.

MIT engineers have now found a way to fabricate a metamaterial that is both strong and stretchy. The base material is typically highly rigid and brittle, but it is printed in precise, intricate patterns that form a structure that is both strong and flexible.

The key to the new material's dual properties is a combination of stiff microscopic struts and a softer woven architecture. This microscopic ""double network,"" which is printed using a plexiglass-like polymer, produced a material that could stretch over four times its size without fully breaking. In comparison, the polymer in other forms has little to no stretch and shatters easily once cracked.

The researchers say the new double-network design can be applied to other materials, for instance to fabricate stretchy ceramics, glass, and metals. Such tough yet bendy materials could be made into tear-resistant textiles, flexible semiconductors, electronic chip packaging, and durable yet compliant scaffolds on which to grow cells for tissue repair.

""We are opening up this new territory for metamaterials,"" says Carlos Portela, the Robert N. Noyce Career Development Associate Professor at MIT. ""You could print a double-network metal or ceramic, and you could get a lot of these benefits, in that it would take more energy to break them, and they would be significantly more stretchable.""

Portela and his colleagues will report their findings in the journal Nature Materials. His MIT co-authors include first author James Utama Surjadi as well as Bastien Aymon and Molly Carton.

Inspired gel

Along with other research groups, Portela and his colleagues have typically designed metamaterials by printing or nanofabricating microscopic lattices using conventional polymers similar to plexiglass and ceramic. The specific pattern, or architecture, that they print can impart exceptional strength and impact resistance to the resulting metamaterial.

Several years ago, Portela was curious whether a metamaterial could be made from an inherently stiff material, but be patterned in a way that would turn it into a much softer, stretchier version.

""We realized that the field of metamaterials has not really tried to make an impact in the soft matter realm,"" he says. ""So far, we've all been looking for the stiffest and strongest materials possible.""

Instead, he looked for a way to synthesize softer, stretchier metamaterials. Rather than printing microscopic struts and trusses, similar to those of conventional lattice-based metamaterials, he and his team made an architecture of interwoven springs, or coils. They found that, while the material they used was itself stiff like plexiglass, the resulting woven metamaterial was soft and springy, like rubber.

""They were stretchy, but too soft and compliant,"" Portela recalls.

In looking for ways to bulk up their softer metamaterial, the team found inspiration in an entirely different material: hydrogel. Hydrogels are soft, stretchy, Jell-O-like materials that are composed of mostly water and a bit of polymer structure. Researchers including groups at MIT have devised ways to make hydrogels that are both soft and stretchy, and also tough. They do so by combining polymer networks with very different properties, such as a network of molecules that is naturally stiff, which gets chemically cross-linked with another molecular network that is inherently soft. Portela and his colleagues wondered whether such a double-network design could be adapted to metamaterials.

""That was our 'aha' moment,"" Portela says. ""We thought: Can we get inspiration from these hydrogels to create a metamaterial with similar stiff and stretchy properties?""

Strut and weave

For their new study, the team fabricated a metamaterial by combining two microscopic architectures. The first is a rigid, grid-like scaffold of struts and trusses. The second is a pattern of coils that weave around each strut and truss. Both networks are made from the same acrylic plastic and are printed in one go, using a high-precision, laser-based printing technique called two-photon lithography.

The researchers printed samples of the new double-network-inspired metamaterial, each measuring in size from several square microns to several square millimeters. They put the material through a series of stress tests, in which they attached either end of the sample to a specialized nanomechanical press and measured the force it took to pull the material apart. They also recorded high-resolution videos to observe the locations and ways in which the material stretched and tore as it was pulled apart.

They found their new double-network design was able stretch three times its own length, which also happened to be 10 times farther compared to a conventional lattice-patterned metamaterial printed with the same acrylic plastic. Portela says the new material's stretchy resistance comes from the interactions between the material's rigid struts and the messier, coiled weave as the material is stressed and pulled.

""Think of this woven network as a mess of spaghetti tangled around a lattice. As we break the monolithic lattice network, those broken parts come along for the ride, and now all this spaghetti gets entangled with the lattice pieces,"" Portela explains. ""That promotes more entanglement between woven fibers, which means you have more friction and more energy dissipation.""

In other words, the softer structure wound throughout the material's rigid lattice takes on more stress thanks to multiple knots or entanglements promoted by the cracked struts. As this stress spreads unevenly through the material, an initial crack is unlikely to go straight through and quickly tear the material. What's more, the team found that if they introduced strategic holes, or ""defects,"" in the metamaterial, they could further dissipate any stress that the material undergoes, making it even stretchier and more resistant to tearing apart.

""You might think this makes the material worse,"" says study co-author Surjadi. ""But we saw once we started adding defects, we doubled the amount of stretch we were able to do, and tripled the amount of energy that we dissipated. That gives us a material that's both stiff and tough, which is usually a contradiction.""

The team has developed a computational framework that can help engineers estimate how a metamaterial will perform given the pattern of its stiff and stretchy networks. They envision such a blueprint will be useful in designing tear-proof textiles and fabrics.

""We also want to try this approach on more brittle materials, to give them multifunctionality,"" Portela says. ""So far we've talked of mechanical properties, but what if we could also make them conductive, or responsive to temperature? For that, the two networks could be made from different polymers, that respond to temperature in different ways, so that a fabric can open its pores or become more compliant when it's warm and can be more rigid when it's cold. That's something we can explore now.""

Metrics details

Recent advances in quantum communications have underscored the crucial role of optical coherence in developing quantum networks. This resource, which is fundamental to the phase-based architecture of the quantum internet1, has enabled the only successful demonstrations of multi-node quantum networks2,3,4 and substantially extended the range of quantum key distribution (QKD)5. However, the scalability of coherence-based quantum protocols remains uncertain owing to the specialized hardware required, such as ultra-stable optical cavities and cryogenic photon detectors. Here we implement the coherence-based twin-field QKD protocol over a 254-kilometre commercial telecom network spanning between Frankfurt and Kehl, Germany, achieving encryption key distribution at 110 bits per second. Our results are enabled by a scalable approach to optical coherence distribution, supported by a practical system architecture and non-cryogenic single-photon detection aided by off-band phase stabilization. Our results demonstrate repeater-like quantum communication in an operational network setting, doubling the distance for practical real-world QKD implementations without cryogenic cooling. In addition, to our knowledge, we realized one of the largest QKD networks featuring measurement-device-independent properties6. Our research aligns the requirements of coherence-based quantum communication with the capabilities of existing telecommunication infrastructure, which is likely to be useful to the future of high-performance quantum networks, including the implementation of advanced quantum communication protocols, quantum repeaters, quantum sensing networks and distributed quantum computing7.

Metrics details

Patients with treatment-refractory pancreatic cancer often succumb to systemic metastases1,2,3; however, the transcriptomic heterogeneity that underlies therapeutic recalcitrance remains understudied, particularly in a spatial context. Here we construct high-resolution maps of lineage states, clonal architecture and the tumour microenvironment (TME) using spatially resolved transcriptomics from 55 samples of primary tumour and metastases (liver, lung and peritoneum) collected from rapid autopsies of 13 people. We observe discernible transcriptomic shifts in cancer-cell lineage states as tumours transition from primary sites to organ-specific metastases, with the most pronounced intra-patient distinctions between liver and lung. Phylogenetic trees constructed from inferred copy number variations in primary and metastatic loci in each patient highlight diverse patient-specific evolutionary trajectories and clonal dissemination. We show that multiple tumour lineage states co-exist in each tissue, including concurrent metastatic foci in the same organ. Agnostic to tissue site, lineage states correlate with distinct TME features, such as the spatial proximity of TGFB1-expressing myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts (myCAFs) to aggressive ‘basal-like' cancer cells, but not to cells in the ‘classical' or ‘intermediate' states. These findings were validated through orthogonal and cross-species analyses using mouse tissues and patient-derived organoids. Notably, basal-like cancer cells aligned with myCAFs correlate with plasma-cell exclusion from the tumour milieu, and neighbouring cell analyses suggest that CXCR4–CXCL12 signalling is the underlying basis for observed immune exclusion. Collectively, our findings underscore the profound transcriptomic heterogeneity and microenvironmental dynamics that characterize treatment-refractory pancreatic cancer.

Metrics details

The maritime Phoenician civilization from the Levant transformed the entire Mediterranean during the first millennium bce1,2,3. However, the extent of human movement between the Levantine Phoenician homeland and Phoenician–Punic settlements in the central and western Mediterranean has been unclear in the absence of comprehensive ancient DNA studies. Here, we generated genome-wide data for 210 individuals, including 196 from 14 sites traditionally identified as Phoenician and Punic in the Levant, North Africa, Iberia, Sicily, Sardinia and Ibiza, and an early Iron Age individual from Algeria. Levantine Phoenicians made little genetic contribution to Punic settlements in the central and western Mediterranean between the sixth and second centuries bce, despite abundant archaeological evidence of cultural, historical, linguistic and religious links4. Instead, these inheritors of Levantine Phoenician culture derived most of their ancestry from a genetic profile similar to that of Sicily and the Aegean. Much of the remaining ancestry originated from North Africa, reflecting the growing influence of Carthage5. However, this was a minority contributor of ancestry in all of the sampled sites, including in Carthage itself. Different Punic sites across the central and western Mediterranean show similar patterns of high genetic diversity. We also detect genetic relationships across the Mediterranean, reflecting shared demographic processes that shaped the Punic world.

Open science principles require making all data used to support the conclusions of a study fully available, and we support these principles here by making publicly available not only the digital copies of molecules (the uploaded sequences) but also the molecular copies (the aDNA libraries themselves, which constitute molecular data storage). Researchers who wish to carry out deeper sequencing of libraries published in this study should make a request to the corresponding author D.R. We commit to granting reasonable requests as long as the libraries remain preserved in our laboratories, with no requirement that we be included as collaborators or co-authors on any resulting publications. The raw DNA sequences for individuals newly sequenced in this study are deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive under accession number PRJEB86313. Their processed genotype data in pseudohaploid eigenstrat format can be obtained from the Harvard Dataverse repository (https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/UPDESR). We include other newly reported data such as radiocarbon dates and archaeological context information in the Article and its Supplementary Information. We plotted the maps in Figs. 1 and 4 using the Python package basemap. The land-sea mask, coastline, lake, river and political boundary data are extracted from the GSHHG datasets (v.2.3.6) using GMT (5.x series). They are included under the terms of the open-source LGPLv3+ license.

We deposited the code for analysing the data and producing the figures in this Article at GitHub (https://github.com/hringbauer/punic_aDNA).

We project individuals sequenced at over 20,000 SNPs onto the same two PCs as in Fig. 1 (calculated from modern individuals, grey dots). Here, we plot all individuals from Punic archaeological sites, excluding the Phoenician site of Akhziv and including the 20 individuals dated to the Roman period (Supplementary Table 5). We split the sample into panels representing our four major geographic regions: Iberia, Sardinia, North Africa, and Sicily. The shape of the symbols indicates the site (lower left legend), and the colour indicates the date range of each individual (as described in the upper right legend).

The 122 Phoenician-Punic individuals sequenced for more than 100,000 SNPs were jointly analysed with 24 individuals from related ancient populations across the Mediterranean (Supplementary Table 12). (a) The model with the highest likelihood was obtained for each value of K among 50 replicate runs. Individuals are grouped based on region. Values of the ΔK score of58 are specified for K = 3,4, with a higher score obtained for K = 3, suggesting optimal fit. (b) A more detailed depiction of the best model obtained with K = 3 latent ancestry components corresponding to North African ancestry (red), eastern ancestry (green), and central/western Mediterranean ancestry (blue). Individuals are partitioned within each region according to site and time range (see legend). The unsupervised ADMIXTURE model does not adequately differentiate between Levantine ancestry and ancestry found in other Mediterranean locations (e.g., Anatolia and Sicily), unlike the qpAdm models of Extended Data Fig. 3.

We partitioned individuals by region: (a) North Africa, (b) Sicily, (c) Sardinia, (d) Iberia, and (e) the Levant. Within each region, we grouped individuals by site, and for sites in Sicily, Sardinia, and Iberia, also by broad date ranges (see legend for colour code). We ordered the models of each individual according to their P-values (grey bar above each model). We report P-values assuming that the LRT statistic is chi-squared distributed with degrees of freedom determined by the number of populations and of contributing source populations. We did not correct these P-values for multiple testing, but this approach is conservative since we report models with comparatively high P-values (those that are not rejected by the test). Individuals with low coverage (fewer than 100,000 SNPs) are indicated by an asterisk (*) next to the sample ID. Eastern ancestry models are indicated by a contribution of the proxy sources Levant MLBA. In contrast, western ancestry models are indicated by contributions from either Greece BA (Myc), Sicily EBA, Sardinia LBA, Iberia LBA, or Steppe MLBA. There are five individuals for whom no valid eastern or western model was inferred. For four of them, we inferred valid models under the broad ancestry scheme (marked by an asterisk above the vertical bar), and for one (I22122 from Tharros, Sardinia), we could not infer any valid model.

We exclude from this analysis the Akhziv sample, the three individuals from Sicily and Sardinia that cluster near Levantine individuals in the 2D PCA, and one individual for which we could not fit a qpAdm model. The qpAdm estimates are based on the smallest proportions estimated for the individual in a valid qpAdm model (see Methods). The PCA-based estimates of North African ancestry were computed by projecting the location of each sample in the PCA onto a cline from the cluster defined by Bronze Age individuals from Sicily to the cluster defined by North African individuals (see Supplementary Information S3 for more details). The two approaches yield similar estimates, with qpAdm being more sensitive to low ancestry proportions. Individuals from Kerkouane (depicted as squares) appear to have a broad range of North African ancestry (0 - 94%). Individuals from Sicily typically have lower proportions of North African ancestry (<20%), and we observe no significant shift in time. On the other hand, in Sardinia, none of the 12 individuals for which we inferred more than 10% North African ancestry (according to at least one of the two approaches) dated before 400 BCE, suggesting that North African ancestry was likely introduced around that time (Supplementary Information S3). We see a similar pattern in Iberia, but since we only have one individual from Iberia dating before 400 BCE, we cannot confidently infer the absence of North African ancestry during this time.

We inferred the first four characters of the ISOGG 2019 Y haplogroup classification for all Phoenician and Punic males with more than 100,000 autosomal SNPs covered (as those in almost all cases have sufficient coverage on the Y chromosome; see Methods). (a) Pie chart of Y haplogroup frequencies. (b) We visualize the Y haplogroup diversity partitioned per Phoenician or Punic site and denote each individual's haplotype by one circle. We set the height of the bar to the overall frequency (as depicted in panel a). The numbers in brackets indicate the total Y haplotype sample size.

(a) Y haplogroup diversity measured using the Inverse Simpson index. This value is computed as in Fig. 3a, excluding the three Punic individuals (from Kerkouane, Villaricos and Selinunte) with distinct North African Y haplogroups E1a and L (see Extended Data Fig. 5). (b) autosomal diversity measured using the first two PCs from Fig. 1 and the mean pairwise distance of those coordinates. This value is computed as in Fig. 3b, excluding individuals with more than 10% North African ancestry based on qpAdm in Phoenician-Punic sites (see Extended Data Fig. 4). Here, we combined individuals from the nearby Sicilian sites of Birgi, Motya, and Lilybaeum into one group (labelled Lilybaeum here). In both panels, the diversity measures for the context populations are as in Fig. 3 (without any additional filtering), and the dashed horizontal bar in both panels indicates the maximum diversity observed in sites dating before 500 BCE. See Supplementary Information S5 for a more detailed description of this analysis.

We reconstructed two pedigrees based on inferring biological relatives with pairwise kinship (using IBD segment sharing) and uniparental haplogroups: (a) A pedigree linking five individuals from Kerkouane, North Africa; (b) A pedigree linking three individuals from Tharros, Sardinia. In the Kerkouane pedigree in (a), individuals I24215 and I24194 are inferred to be 3rd-4th degree relatives of the two siblings I24494 and I24193, but the exact pedigree relationship cannot be resolved. Each panel depicts the projection of the related individuals onto the two major PCs used in Fig. 1. Each pedigree specifies the sample IDs for all individuals, the mitochondrial (maternal) haplogroup and the Y (paternal) haplogroup for males. Both pedigrees contain individuals dating to 800–400 calBCE and link several individuals via the maternal lineage: We infer four identical maternal haplogroups in Kerkouane and a maternal grandfather in Tharros–two observations that are inconsistent with strict patrilocality.

We computed runs of homozygosity (ROH) in all individuals with more than 400,000 SNPs covered and recorded the total length (in cM) of ROHs binned by length into four categories (see legend). We label individuals with at least 50 and 100 cM of their genome in long ROH (>20 cM) with triangle and square marks as in30 - to indicate offspring of close biological parental relatives. (a) ROH in Phoenician and Punic individuals, grouped by site. (b) ROH in individuals from relevant Bronze and Iron Age contexts (as depicted in Fig. 1). (c) Expected ROH for offspring of various cousin matings (according to the degree of relation between parents) and for individuals sampled in populations with small effective size (calculated as described in30).

Ancestry models inferred using qpAdm for individuals from Sicily from (a) the indigenous Iron Age sites of Polizzello and Monte Falcone, (b) from Phoenician sites before Roman expansion (as shown in Extended Data Fig. 3b), and (c) from Punic sites after Roman expansion. Colour horizontal bars indicate radiocarbon dates. The models of each individual are sorted according to their P-values (grey bar above each model). We report P-values assuming that the LRT statistic is chi-squared distributed with degrees of freedom determined by the number of populations and of contributing source populations. We did not correct these P-values for multiple testing, but this approach is conservative since we report models with comparatively high P-values (those that are not rejected by the test). Eastern ancestry models are indicated by a contribution of the proxy source Levant MLBA. In contrast, western ancestry models are indicated by contributions from either Greece BA (Myc), Sicily EBA, Sardinia LBA, Iberia LBA, or Steppe MLBA. There are seven individuals for which no valid eastern or western model was inferred. We inferred valid models under the broad ancestry scheme (marked by an asterisk above the vertical bar) for five of them. Two individuals were inferred to be related through IBD-sharing and are indicated in the figure. The analysis suggests that indigenous populations in Sicily have similar ancestry patterns as observed in the Phoenician sites but without North African ancestry. In later periods, we see the introduction of diverse ancestry sources (Levantine and western Mediterranean), likely associated with the Roman expansion into Sicily. See Supplementary Information S3 for more details.

(a) Bronze and Iron Age reference and Levantine populations. We show the same PCA as in Fig. 1 but focus on the ancient reference populations. (b) Zoom in PCA projections of Levantine populations. We show the same PCA depicted in (a), but zooming into the region where Levantine individuals project. We also include additional Bronze and Iron Age Levant individuals not included in Fig. 1. Those previously published individuals originate from Sidon in present-day Lebanon17 and various sites in present-day Israel (Megiddo, Yehud, Hazor, Baq'ah25, Tel Shadud64, Ashkelon64,65). Abbreviations: MLBA: Middle-Late Bronze Age, MBA: Middle Bronze Age, IA: Iron Age. All 13 individuals from Akhziv cluster next to other Levantine individuals, together with a single outlier individual from Tharros (I22119) inferred to have Levantine ancestry (Extended Data Fig. 3).

An ancient Middle Eastern civilization that developed an early alphabet spread its culture far and wide — but not its DNA, finds a 23 April Nature study1 of hundreds of ancient human genomes.

Phoenician civilization emerged more than 3,000 years ago, centred around what is now Lebanon, before expanding across the Mediterranean Sea. Middle Eastern Phoenician city-states eventually fell to other groups, but the culture thrived farther west — most notably in Carthage, in what is now Tunisia, until its destruction in 146 bc.

From Vikings to Beethoven: what your DNA says about your ancient relatives

Phoenician city-states shared languages — recorded with an alphabet that was a precursor to Greek and Latin letters — religious practices and maritime trading economies. Many researchers have presumed that their inhabitants also shared ancestries connected to the culture's Middle Eastern origins.

To study this history, population geneticist Harald Ringbauer at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and his colleagues analysed the DNA from the remains of around 200 people from Phoenician archaeological sites in the Middle East, Europe and North Africa.

To Ringbauer's surprise, people from Mediterranean outposts of Phoenician culture — also known as Punic people — shared no ancestry with ancient Middle Easterners, even those from sites linked to Phoenicians and their forebears the Canaanites.

But neither did Punic people's genomes always resemble those of people from other local populations, such as those in Sardinia and Ibiza. Instead, Punic people shared an ancestry profile resembling those of ancient inhabitants of Greece and Sicily. Over time, North African ancestry entered the mix — reflecting the rise of Carthage after 500 bc.

Metrics details

Acute myocardial infarction is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide1. Clinical studies have shown that the severity of cardiac injury after myocardial infarction exhibits a circadian pattern, with larger infarcts and poorer outcomes in patients experiencing morning-onset events2,3,4,5,6,7. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these diurnal variations remain unclear. Here we show that the core circadian transcription factor BMAL17,8,9,10,11 regulates circadian-dependent myocardial injury by forming a transcriptionally active heterodimer with a non-canonical partner—hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF2A)12,13,14,15,16—in a diurnal manner. To substantiate this finding, we determined the cryo-EM structure of the BMAL1–HIF2A–DNA complex, revealing structural rearrangements within BMAL1 that enable cross-talk between circadian rhythms and hypoxia signalling. BMAL1 modulates the circadian hypoxic response by enhancing the transcriptional activity of HIF2A and stabilizing the HIF2A protein. We further identified amphiregulin (AREG)16,17 as a rhythmic target of the BMAL1–HIF2A complex, critical for regulating daytime variations of myocardial injury. Pharmacologically targeting the BMAL1–HIF2A–AREG pathway provides cardioprotection, with maximum efficacy when aligned with the pathway's circadian phase. These findings identify a mechanism governing circadian variations of myocardial injury and highlight the therapeutic potential of clock-based pharmacological interventions for treating ischaemic heart disease.

Cardiac injury after acute myocardial infarction (MI) exhibits pronounced circadian rhythmicity, with severity and clinical outcomes varying on the basis of the time of onset2,3,4,5,6,7. Circadian rhythms, driven by the Earth's day–night cycles, synchronize internal biological functions with environmental changes, enabling organisms to adapt to the daily fluctuations18,19. At the core of these rhythms are transcription factors, notably BMAL17,8,9,10,11, which forms a heterodimer with CLOCK to regulate clock-controlled genes8,10,11,20. Although clinical and preclinical studies have highlighted the importance of circadian rhythms in cardiovascular physiology and diseases6,7,21,22,23,24, the mechanisms underlying circadian variations in myocardial injury remain poorly understood. This knowledge gap poses challenges to therapeutic efficacy and may contribute to suboptimal treatment outcomes21,25. Here we identify a molecular mechanism in which cross-talk between circadian rhythms and hypoxia signalling13,14,15,26,27,28,29,30 underpins circadian-dependent cardioprotection. Given the universal and essential roles of these pathways across nearly all cells and organs, our findings have broad implications for advancing the understanding and treatment of ischaemic diseases influenced by circadian rhythms.

Consistent with previous studies27,31, diurnal variations in cardiac injury and long-term outcomes were evident in a mouse myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) model, with the least injury at zeitgeber time 8 (ZT8; 15:00) and the most severe at ZT20 (03:00) (Supplementary Fig. 1). To identify the molecular factors that drive these circadian variations, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on area-at-risk (AAR) samples collected after 2 h of reperfusion at ZT8 and ZT20. This analysis revealed distinct transcriptional profiles, with 18 genes upregulated and 42 downregulated at ZT8 compared with at ZT20 (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Notably, BMAL1 target genes, including Per2, Per3, Nr1d2 and Dbp, were significantly upregulated at ZT8 (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 1), indicating elevated BMAL1 transcriptional activity. Conversely, Bmal1 transcript levels were downregulated at ZT8, exhibiting an antiphasic expression pattern relative to its targets, a hallmark of circadian transcription–translation feedback loops10,11,20. Analysis using quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT–qPCR) confirmed these oscillations (Fig. 1c). Gene Ontology (GO) (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 2) and KEGG (Extended Data Fig. 1c) pathway analyses identified ‘circadian rhythm' as a highly enriched pathway, while a dysregulation network further emphasized BMAL1's central role in orchestrating diurnal gene expression in ischaemic mouse hearts (Extended Data Fig. 1d).

Source Data

To investigate transcriptional pathways in human hearts experiencing myocardial injury at different times of the day, we examined left ventricle (LV) biopsy samples from 73 patients undergoing elective aortic valve replacement surgery (NCT00281164). Samples from the morning (n = 56, median, 10:32) or afternoon (n = 17, median, 17:15) cohort were collected before and after around 80 min of ischaemia induced by aortic cross-clamping (Fig. 1e). Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were comparable between cohorts (Supplementary Table 3). RNA-seq analysis of pre-clamping samples revealed significant circadian modulation of gene expression, with BMAL1 identified as the most downregulated gene in the morning cohort (Extended Data Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 4), suggesting its role in the time-of-day-dependent regulation of cardiac physiology, such as metabolism and contractility6,21,22,23,24,32,33. Post-clamping RNA-seq analysis revealed distinct transcriptional signatures based on surgery timing (Extended Data Fig. 1f), with timing emerging as the dominant determinant over covariates such as smoking or comorbidities (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 5). BMAL1 remained substantially downregulated in the morning cohort (Fig. 1g, Extended Data Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 6), further implicating it in modulating the heart's ischaemic response. GO and KEGG analyses revealed significant enrichment in the ‘circadian rhythm' pathway (Fig. 1h, Extended Data Fig. 1h and Supplementary Table 7), with antiphasic expression patterns of BMAL1 and its targets paralleling murine observations (Fig. 1i). These findings suggest that the conserved role of BMAL1 as a transcription factor is involved in regulating circadian variations in myocardial injury across species.

To further explore BMAL1's functional role, we generated an inducible cardiomyocyte-specific Bmal1-knockout mouse line (Bmal1loxP/loxPMyh6-cre; hereafter, Bmal1loxP/loxP myosin-Cre+) by crossing floxed Bmal1 mice with myosin-Cre+ mice and inducing Bmal1 ablation by tamoxifen injection at 8 weeks of age. We then subjected Bmal1loxP/loxP myosin-Cre+ mice and control myosin-Cre+ mice to myocardial IRI at ZT8 or ZT20 (Fig. 1j). After 2 h of reperfusion, Bmal1-deficient mice showed abolished circadian variability in myocardial injury and diminished endogenous cardioprotection at ZT8 compared with the controls (Fig. 1k–n). This phenotype persisted during extended reperfusion (day 14 after MI), as speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE)34,35 demonstrated that ZT8 Bmal1-deficient mice exhibited significantly reduced systolic function (ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening (FS), global longitudinal strain (GLS)), greater LV dilation (end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume) and LV mass (end-diastolic LV mass and end-systolic LV mass) (Fig. 1o and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Impaired contractility was evident in both infarcted (anterior mid and posterior apex) and non-infarcted (posterior mid and posterior base) heart segments, indicating more extensive myocardial injury (Supplementary Fig. 2b,c). Pronounced intraventricular disparities further suggested heart failure progression35 (Fig. 1p,q). By contrast, IRI at ZT20 showed no significant differences in cardiac function between knockout and control mice. These findings highlight BMAL1's key role in circadian regulation of acute myocardial injury and long-term outcomes.

As a key member of the basic helix-loop-helix PER–ARNT–SIM (bHLH-PAS) family, BMAL1 exerts regulatory functions through interactions with specific partners8,10,11,20. Using the Human Reference Interactome (HuRI)36, we identified hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF2A, also known as EPAS1), another bHLH-PAS family member, as the most abundantly expressed BMAL1 interactor in human LV (largest node in Fig. 2a). GO analysis highlighted shared roles of BMAL1 and HIF2A in transcriptional regulation and cellular responses to hypoxia and oxidative stress (Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 8). Given the severe hypoxia during MI13,15,26,28 and HIF2A's established role in oxygen homeostasis16,37, we examined the BMAL1–HIF2A interaction under hypoxic conditions. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays in HEK293 cells revealed a robust BMAL1–HIF2A nuclear interaction under ambient hypoxia (1% O2, 4 h), distinct from the oxygen-insensitive BMAL1–CLOCK interaction (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 2b). Consistent with previous reports38, binding of BMAL1 to HIF1A is considerably weaker (Fig. 2b,c). We further validated in primary human cardiomyocytes (HCMs) using endogenous co-IP and proximity ligation assay (PLA)39, confirming a robust BMAL1–HIF2A interaction at the single-molecule level under hypoxia, while BMAL1–HIF1A binding was also detected, albeit at significantly lower levels (Fig. 2d–f). The N-terminal regions of BMAL1 and HIF2A, containing conserved bHLH and PAS-A/B domains, mediate partner dimerization8,40 (Fig. 2g), while their C-terminal transactivation domains enable transcriptional activation40. Pull-down assays using recombinant BMAL1 and HIF2A demonstrated direct binding between their N-terminal regions (Fig. 2h). Size-exclusion chromatography confirmed the formation of a stable BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimer (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). Despite a 67% sequence identity between the N-terminal regions of HIF1A and HIF2A, BMAL1 exhibits notably weaker binding to HIF1A (Fig. 2h). These results demonstrate a specific and direct interaction between BMAL1 and HIF2A during hypoxia.

Although HIF2A is well recognized for its cardioprotective role against myocardial IRI16,28,41, its involvement in diurnal cardiac injury remains unclear. After 2 h of reperfusion, HIF2A protein levels were notably stabilized in the nuclear fraction of the AAR at ZT8 but not ZT20, paralleling BMAL1 expression (Fig. 2i,j), suggesting a time-of-day-dependent myocardial hypoxic response. On day 1 after MI, immunofluorescence revealed significantly higher HIF2A levels in the cytoplasm and nuclei of cardiomyocytes in the border zone (ischaemic region) at ZT8 compared with at ZT20, while expression remained low in the remote myocardium (Extended Data Fig. 3a–c). BMAL1 displayed a similar diurnal nuclear localization pattern (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e), with significantly greater co-localization with HIF2A in the ZT8 border zone (Fig. 2k), indicating circadian regulation of their interaction. To elucidate the functional role of HIF2A in circadian myocardial injury, we used an inducible cardiomyocyte-specific Hif2a knockout model (Hif2aloxP/loxP myosin-Cre+)16,41. Similar to the Bmal1-deficient mice, these mice exhibited abolished circadian-dependent cardiac injury and diminished endogenous cardioprotection at ZT8 (Fig. 2l–o). On day 14 after MI, STE revealed worsened systolic function, increased LV dilation and mass, and greater wall motion abnormalities and intraventricular disparities in ZT8 Hif2aloxP/loxP myosin-Cre+ mice compared with the controls (Fig. 2p–s and Supplementary Fig. 2d–f). These changes were absent at ZT20. By contrast, cardiomyocyte Hif1a deletion did not affect circadian variations in myocardial injury (Supplementary Fig. 3a–k). These results highlight a selective role for cardiomyocyte-specific HIF2A in regulating diurnal susceptibility to IRI.

Next, to investigate how the BMAL1–HIF2A complex influences diurnal variations of myocardial injury, we reanalysed our previously published microarray data from Hif2aloxP/loxP myosin-Cre+ and myosin-Cre+ mice16. Among potential HIF2A target genes that are uniquely upregulated in myosin-Cre+ mice after IRI (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 9), Areg—a known HIF2A target and member of the epidermal growth factor family16,17—exhibited the largest diurnal fold change in the AAR at ZT8 compared with at ZT20 (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 10). AREG protein levels in cytosolic extracts mirrored this diurnal pattern, peaking at ZT8 (Fig. 3c,d). Immunofluorescence staining confirmed elevated AREG expression in the cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes within the border zone at ZT8, while infarcted and remote myocardium showed low levels (Fig. 3e,f and Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). Minimal AREG expression was detected in fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). This spatiotemporal pattern aligns with BMAL1 and HIF2A nuclear co-localization in the ZT8 border zone (Fig. 2k), suggesting that the BMAL1–HIF2A complex drives diurnal Areg induction in ischaemic hearts.

To assess the role of the cell-intrinsic molecular clock in AREG regulation, synchronized HCMs were exposed to hypoxia (1% O2, 4 h) at different circadian times (CT0 to CT40). CT0 marks the start of the circadian cycle in vitro, corresponding to ZT0, the onset of the light phase in light-entrained systems. Under normoxia, AREG transcript levels were non-rhythmic, but hypoxia significantly induced AREG at CT32 (analogous to ZT8), with a much weaker induction at CT20 (Fig. 3g). This pattern mirrored the rhythmic expression of the BMAL1–HIF2A complex in HCMs (Fig. 3h,i), suggesting circadian-dependent, hypoxia-driven regulation of AREG. Silencing HIF2A or BMAL1 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly reduced hypoxia-induced AREG expression, whereas CLOCK, HIF1A or HIF1B knockdown had no effect (Fig. 3j). Consistently, myocardial IRI-induced Areg expression was markedly reduced in cardiomyocytes from Bmal1- or Hif2a-deficient mice (Fig. 3k–m). Together, these findings underscore the BMAL1–HIF2A complex as a key regulator of rhythmic AREG induction during both hypoxia and myocardial IRI.

To examine how the BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimer regulates AREG, we investigated its DNA-binding properties and potential transcriptional synergy under hypoxia. HIF2A–HIF1B and BMAL1–CLOCK complexes bind to hypoxia response elements (HREs, [A/G]CGTG)40 and E-box motifs (CACGTG)8, respectively, which share notable sequence similarity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Supplementary Fig. 3l) and surface plasmon resonance analysis (Fig. 3n,o) demonstrated robust and comparable binding of the BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimer to both motifs, confirming its ability to recognize DNA elements of target genes. Analysis of the human AREG promoter using JASPAR (https://jaspar.elixir.no/; v.2022) revealed a conserved binding site (CAGGTG) for BMAL1 and HIF2A across species (Fig. 3p). Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by qPCR (ChIP–qPCR) in HCMs confirmed significant binding enrichment of endogenous HIF2A to this site under hypoxia at CT32 but not at CT20 (Fig. 3q), indicating circadian gating of HIF2A transcriptional activity. This finding aligns with circadian-dependent BMAL1–HIF2A interaction, which peaks at CT32 (Fig. 3r) and corresponds to enhanced AREG induction (Fig. 3g). Additional ChIP–qPCR confirmed direct BMAL1 binding to the same conserved site during hypoxia (Fig. 3s). To evaluate functional cross-talk between BMAL1 and HIF2A at the chromatin level, the conserved sequence was cloned into a luciferase reporter and transfected into HEK293 cells. Both proteins enhanced luciferase activity, with co-transfection producing a synergistic effect and greater activation (Fig. 3t). These findings demonstrate that BMAL1 and HIF2A function as an integrated regulatory unit, synergistically driving rhythmic AREG transcription during hypoxia.

To determine whether AREG directly contributes to circadian variations in myocardial injury, we analysed its role using genetic deletion models. Similar to Bmal1- and Hif2a-deficient mice, Areg−/− mice exhibited a loss of circadian variations in myocardial injury and diminished endogenous cardioprotection at ZT8 after 2 h of reperfusion (Fig. 4a–e). Diurnal variations in long-term outcomes, including cardiac function, LV size and mass, segmental wall motion abnormalities and intraventricular synchronicity, observed in wild-type (WT) controls, were completely absent in Areg−/− mice by day 14 after MI (Fig. 4f,g and Supplementary Fig. 4a–d). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labelling (TUNEL) staining, which detects double-stranded DNA breaks as a marker of apoptosis, revealed significantly increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the border zone of Areg−/− mice at ZT8 compared with in WT mice, with minimal differences observed at ZT20 (Fig. 4h,i). These findings indicate a functional role of AREG in regulating daytime-dependent cardiac injury.

Building on AREG's critical role in circadian injury modulation, we assessed its therapeutic potential through exogenous administration and gene delivery. To mimic a clinical scenario of reperfusion treatment, recombinant AREG (10 µg) or vehicle was administered to C57BL/6J mice at the onset of reperfusion. Timed AREG treatment elevated AREG protein levels in the AAR (Fig. 4j–l) and significantly reduced infarct size and serum troponin I levels after 2 h of reperfusion. Notably, protection was greater at ZT20, potentially compensating for the lower endogenous AREG levels at that time (Fig. 4m–p). Furthermore, AREG (10 µg) administered daily for 3 days after injury at ZT20 improved LV systolic function, reduced cardiac remodelling, restored segmental contractility and re-established normokinesis by day 14 after MI compared with the vehicle controls (Fig. 4q,r and Supplementary Fig. 4e–h). TUNEL staining on day 1 after MI revealed notably reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the border zone in ZT20-treated mice (Fig. 4s,t). To further assess its therapeutic potential, we used adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) to deliver the Areg gene under the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter for cardiomyocyte-specific targeting. Tail-vein injection of Areg-AAV (2 × 1011 genome copies (GC) per mouse) significantly increased AREG levels in the heart by day 28, with minimal off-target expression (Supplementary Fig. 5a–e). This intervention reduced the infarct size and improved cardiac function, with greater effects at ZT20 (Supplementary Fig. 5f–n). These findings establish AREG as a promising therapeutic target for time-optimized interventions, offering strategies to harness circadian rhythms for improved cardiac protection.

To examine the translational potential of modulating circadian rhythms for cardioprotection, we used nobiletin (NOB), a flavonoid that enhances circadian rhythms by directly activating RORs42, key transcriptional activators of Bmal110,20. NOB treatment in C57BL/6J mice (200 mg per kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.)) significantly upregulated RORα, leading to a 60–80-fold increase in Bmal1 mRNA and a 2–3-fold increase in protein levels at both ZT8 and ZT20, ultimately inducing AREG upregulation in the heart (Extended Data Fig. 5a–d). Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed elevated nuclear BMAL1 and cytoplasmic AREG in cardiomyocytes in the border zone on day 1 after MI (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f). NOB treatment significantly attenuated acute myocardial injury, improved long-term cardiac function and reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, with more pronounced protection observed at ZT20 (Extended Data Fig. 5g–n), probably due to its ability to compensate for the natural trough in nuclear BMAL1 expression and transcriptional activity at this time10,11,20. To determine whether NOB's cardioprotective effects depend on the BMAL1–HIF2A–AREG pathway, we evaluated its efficacy in genetic knockout models. Cardioprotection was completely abrogated in Hif2a-deficient mice treated with NOB, as evidenced by larger infarct sizes and significantly impaired cardiac function (Supplementary Fig. 6a–h). Similarly, NOB treatment failed in Bmal1loxP/loxP myosin-Cre+ mice (Supplementary Fig. 6i–o) and Areg−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 6p–u), confirming the essential role of this pathway. To further assess the benefits of BMAL1 overexpression, we used AAV9 to deliver Bmal1 specifically to cardiomyocytes (Supplementary Fig. 7a–e). BMAL1 overexpression significantly reduced infarct size and improved cardiac function with greater protection observed at ZT20 (Supplementary Fig. 7f–o). These effects mirrored those of NOB treatment, highlighting the therapeutic potential of BMAL1 activation in attenuating myocardial injury and advancing the development of circadian-targeted pharmacological strategies.

To investigate the therapeutic potential of HIF2A activation in myocardial injury, C57BL/6J mice were treated with vadadustat, a prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) inhibitor15 (50 mg per kg, i.p., daily for 3 days) at ZT8 or ZT20. Vadadustat selectively stabilized HIF2A, particularly at ZT8, without affecting HIF1A levels (Extended Data Fig. 6a–d), potentially due to circadian regulation of PHD enzyme activity31. This stabilization significantly reduced infarct sizes and improved cardiac function in ZT8-treated mice, indicating time-dependent cardioprotection (Extended Data Fig. 6e–n). Analysis using co-IP revealed enhanced BMAL1–HIF2A binding in the nuclear fraction of the AAR at ZT8, accompanied by increased AREG expression in cardiomyocytes in the border zone after 3 h of reperfusion (Extended Data Fig. 6o–r). These findings suggest that BMAL1–HIF2A interaction and synergistic AREG induction underlie the circadian-dependent cardioprotection conferred by vadadustat at ZT8. To confirm this mechanism, vadadustat treatment was evaluated in Bmal1-deficient mice, which showed abolished cardioprotection at ZT8, highlighting a BMAL1-dependent mechanism (Supplementary Fig. 8a–g). A similar loss of protection was observed in Hif2a- and Areg-deficient mice, further supporting the essential role of the BMAL1–HIF2A–AREG pathway (Supplementary Fig. 8h–s). Moreover, cardiomyocyte-specific human-HIF2A knock-in mice (LSL-HIF2dPA myosin-Cre+) exhibited similar circadian-dependent HIF2A stabilization and increased Areg induction at ZT8 in mouse hearts (Supplementary Fig. 9a–c). Consistent with vadadustat treatment, HIF2A overexpression significantly reduced infarct size and improved cardiac function, with the most pronounced benefits at ZT8 (Supplementary Fig. 9d–m). These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of time-of-day-dependent HIF2A stabilization in enhancing cardioprotection, paving the way for new chronotherapy interventions.

Circadian-dependent HIF2A stabilization was observed after myocardial IRI, hypoxia, vadadustat administration and in cardiomyocyte-specific HIF2A knock-in mice (Figs. 2i,j, 3h,i, Extended Data Fig. 6a–d and Supplementary Fig. 9a,b), suggesting that clock genes may regulate HIF2A expression. However, RNA-seq and qPCR analyses revealed no circadian variations in Hif2a transcripts after IRI in humans and mice (Extended Data Fig. 7a–c). In Bmal1-deficient mice, nuclear HIF2A protein levels were reduced without changes in Hif2a transcripts, while NOB treatment further stabilized HIF2A protein at both ZT8 and ZT20, again without affecting transcript levels (Extended Data Fig. 7d–k). Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments in HCMs corroborated these findings, indicating a post-translational regulatory mechanism (Extended Data Fig. 7l–q). ChIP–qPCR analysis of predicted E-box elements in the HIF2A promoter showed no detectable BMAL1 binding, suggesting that BMAL1 does not directly regulate HIF2A transcriptionally (Extended Data Fig. 7r). Instead, cycloheximide (CHX) chase assays demonstrated that BMAL1 prolongs the HIF2A protein half-life by reducing its ubiquitin-mediated degradation (Extended Data Fig. 7s–x). Notably, BMAL1 did not affect HIF1A protein stability. These findings identify a role for BMAL1 in stabilizing HIF2A through post-translational mechanisms, offering insights into how circadian rhythms modulate hypoxic response during myocardial injury.

Given BMAL1's interaction with HIF2A, we assessed its influence on the HIF2A–HIF1B complex, which mediates canonical hypoxia signalling. RNA-seq analysis of ischaemic LV biopsy samples from patients and mouse AAR revealed no circadian variation in Hif1b transcript levels (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments in mice and HCMs further confirmed that BMAL1 does not regulate HIF1B transcript or protein levels during IRI or hypoxia (Extended Data Fig. 8c–n). Co-IP analysis showed that BMAL1 overexpression has no impact on HIF2A–HIF1B binding, while ChIP–qPCR revealed no changes in HIF1B binding to the erythropoietin (EPO) promoter43 (Extended Data Fig. 8o–q). Moreover, HIF1B was not observed to bind the AREG promoter, and luciferase reporter assays confirmed that BMAL1 does not affect the transcriptional activity of the HIF2A–HIF1B complex on PGK1 (Extended Data Fig. 8r,s). These findings demonstrate that BMAL1 interacts with HIF2A without disrupting the canonical HIF2A–HIF1B complex, emphasizing its distinct role in circadian regulation of hypoxic responses.

Although the interaction between BMAL1 and HIF2A has been reported38,44,45, the structural information of their heterodimerization remains unclear. To determine the structure using single-particle cryo-EM, we expressed and purified the N-terminal regions of BMAL1 and HIF2A, including the bHLH and PAS domains, bound to a 22-bp DNA containing a canonical HRE element (Fig. 2g, Extended Data Fig. 9a and Supplementary Table 11). After two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) classification, the final approximately 43,000 polished particles were processed for 3D refinement, resulting in a density map with an average resolution of 3.6 Å (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 9b–h). In brief, HIF2A exhibited a better overall resolution compared with BMAL1, probably due to its compact structure and stabilization by BMAL1. An atomic model of the DNA-bound heterodimer was built into the density map using the structures of BMAL1 and HIF2A from the BMAL1–CLOCK8 and HIF2A–HIF1B40 complexes as templates, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 9i,j and Supplementary Table 11).

In the structure, BMAL1 and HIF2A exhibit distinct architectures (Fig. 5b). HIF2A adopts a compact conformation, with the PAS-A domain bridging the bHLH and PAS-B domains, whereas the corresponding domains in BMAL1 are arranged more loosely, lacking interdomain contacts (Fig. 5c). BMAL1 uses its bHLH and PAS domains to wrap around their respective counterparts in HIF2A, establishing four major interfaces (I to IV) (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). Similar to classical bHLH transcription factors, the BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimer binds to the DNA through two α-helices, H1 and h1, from their bHLH domains, inserting into the major groove46 (Extended Data Fig. 10c). Owing to slight mobility, the density of the DNA bases is not well resolved in the map.

Notably, the structure of BMAL1 bound to HIF2A differs significantly from that of its complex with CLOCK8, in which the PAS domains of BMAL1 are tightly packed together (Extended Data Fig. 10d). By contrast, in the BMAL1–HIF2A structure, the PAS domains of BMAL1 are positioned separately and arranged in a conformation similar to the HIF1B observed in its complex with HIF2A. The conformational similarity between BMAL1 and HIF1B is probably due to their significant sequence identity (44%) in the N-terminal region, where several residues involved in HIF2A binding are conserved (Extended Data Fig. 10d and Supplementary Fig. 10). As both BMAL1–CLOCK and BMAL1–HIF2A complexes bind to DNA through their bHLH domains, we superimposed the bHLH domain of BMAL1 and observed that its PAS domains bend in nearly opposite directions. Similarly, superimposing the PAS-A domains of BMAL1 reveals conformational variability in the bHLH and PAS-B domains (Extended Data Fig. 10e,f). These structural comparisons suggest that BMAL1 undergoes significant conformational changes to accommodate different partners (Supplementary Video 1). Notably, proteins with PAS domains in the bHLH family typically form alpha–beta dimers47. In the BMAL1–HIF2A structure, two PAS-B domains form an open end-to-end alpha–beta dimer, with the conserved Trp427 in BMAL1 interacting with Met250 in HIF2A to stabilize the PAS-B dimer (Extended Data Fig. 10d). However, it is unclear whether this interaction allows HIF2A to bind to other factors, similar to the PAS-B interaction between CLOCK and CRY18,48.

To strengthen our structural observations, we mutated conserved residues within each domain of BMAL1. These mutations disrupted BMAL1–HIF2A complex formation both in vitro and in HEK293 cells under hypoxia, underscoring the essential role of each domain in heterodimer stability (Fig. 5e–h). Using a luciferase-reporter assay with a human AREG-gluc reporter containing the common binding sequence (CAGGTG), we observed that BMAL1 mutants significantly impaired BMAL1–HIF2A transactivation at the AREG promoter, underscoring the importance of proper heterodimerization for AREG induction (Fig. 5i). Collectively, our study provides the structural basis of the DNA-bound BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimer, highlighting its role in regulating target genes, such as AREG, and the capability of BMAL1 in bridging diverse pathways through structural rearrangements for partner binding (Fig. 5j).

Our study underscores the pivotal role of the BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimer in mediating circadian-dependent cardioprotection. This conclusion is supported by robust evidence, including the cryo-EM structure, the diurnal interaction between BMAL1 and HIF2A under hypoxia and during IRI, their functional roles in the synergistic transactivation of AREG and their interdependence in mediating circadian-dependent cardioprotection. However, we cannot conclusively prove that BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimerization is the bona fide mechanism regulating the time-of-day dependence of myocardial injury. Although our findings indicate that cardiomyocyte HIF1A does not significantly affect circadian variations in myocardial injury, the established interaction between BMAL1 and HIF1A31,49 warrants further investigation into whether BMAL1–HIF1A interactions in other cells contribute to circadian myocardial injury. Moreover, while we demonstrate that BMAL1 enhances HIF2A transcriptional activity and stabilizes it by reducing ubiquitination, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. For example, it is uncertain whether BMAL1 directly regulates HIF hydroxylation or influences HIF2A levels through alternative post-translational modifications. Finally, the contributions of other circadian rhythm molecules, such as PER2, and their interactions with HIFs may also have a role in this phenomenon27. Further elucidation of these pathways could advance chronotherapeutic strategies to optimize HIF-targeted interventions13,14,15. The widespread presence of peripheral molecular clocks across various cardiac cell types21 emphasizes the need to define BMAL1's tissue-specific roles for coordinated cardiac protection. Our BMAL1–HIF2A–DNA structure reveals BMAL1's ability to undergo structural rearrangements to bind a non-canonical partner, enabling cross-talk between signalling pathways. It also provides a molecular basis for developing therapeutics to stabilize this interaction, offering opportunities for treating ischaemic heart disease. Given the feasibility of integrating circadian timing into clinical practice, prospective trials are needed to evaluate whether aligning treatments with circadian phases or directly targeting circadian rhythms can improve outcomes in patients with MI. Beyond MI, circadian modulation of hypoxic responses may have broader implications for other hypoxia- and inflammation-related diseases with circadian characteristics, potentially paving the way for clock-based therapeutic innovations.

We examined samples from a prospective study of myocardial injury in humans undergoing cardiac surgery (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00281164). The study population consisted of consecutive patients (aged ≥20 years) with aortic stenosis referred to our cardiovascular surgery department at Brigham and Women's Hospital for aortic valve replacement (with or without coronary artery bypass graft) between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2014. Patients enrolled in a concurrent drug or device trial were excluded. This ongoing study involved 56 patients in the morning (samples collected between 08:00 and 12:00; median time, 10:32) and 17 patients who underwent the same procedure in the afternoon (samples collected between 15:00 and 21:00; median time, 17:15). Patients whose surgery fell outside of these time periods were excluded from the analysis. The ethics committee for the Protection of Human Subjects from Research Risks of Brigham and Women's Hospital approved the protocol, and written informed consent was obtained from all of the patients.

Patients underwent aortic valve replacement in the morning or afternoon by the same senior surgeon. Anaesthesia, cardiopulmonary bypass, cardioplegia and surgical procedures were done according to standard guidelines. Anaesthesia was induced with intravenous fentanyl or sufentanil and propofol (0.5–1.5 mg per kg) and maintained with isoflurane. Surgery was done using normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass and repeated antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia. LV biopsy samples were obtained from both the morning and afternoon patient cohorts before and after approximately 80 min of aortic cross-clamping—a procedure that temporarily halts blood flow to the heart. The samples were taken from the site of the routinely placed LV vent.

Animal care was performed according to the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals of the National Institutes of Health. All experimental procedures were approved by the UTHealth Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The sample size was estimated based on published literature on previous murine models of myocardial IRI27. All of the mice were housed under a standard 12 h–12 h light–dark photoperiod at 22 °C with ad libitum access to a standard chow diet, and maintained at a humidity level of 40–60%.

To generate cardiomyocyte-specific deletion, myosin-Cre+ (A1cfTg[Myh6-cre/Esr1*]1Jmk/J, The Jackson Laboratory, 005650), Hif1aloxP/loxP (B6.129-Hif1atm3Rsjo/J, The Jackson Laboratory, 007561), Hif2aloxP/loxP (Epas1tm1Mcs/J, The Jackson Laboratory, 008407), LSL-HIF2dPA (Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(HIF2A*)Kael/J, Jackson Laboratory, 009674), and Bmal1loxP/loxP (B6.129S4(Cg)-Bmal1tm1Weit/J, The Jackson Laboratory, 007668) mice, aged 8 weeks, were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and crossbred as previously described16,27. To address sex as a biological variable, both male and female mice aged 8 to 16 weeks underwent myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion surgery. Our sex-specific analysis, which included assessments of infarct size, troponin levels and cardiac function, revealed no significant differences between sexes29,50. To induce Cre-recombinase activity, mice received an i.p. injection of tamoxifen at a dosage of 1 mg per day for five consecutive days, as previously described29,30,50. A recovery period of 7 days was allowed after the final tamoxifen dose before proceeding with further experimental procedures. In these experiments, myosin-Cre+ mice were used as controls. Moreover, Areg−/− mice (B6;129-Aregtm1Dle/Mmnc, MMRRC, MMRRC_011533-UNC)51 aged 8 weeks were purchased from Mutant Mouse Resources & Research Centers. To circumvent lactation difficulties observed in younger female mice, Areg−/− mice were bred using a heterozygous (Areg+/−) strategy16,41. Control mice for these experiments were C57BL/6J (The Jackson Laboratory, 000664) mice aged 8 weeks, chosen for their same genetic background as the Areg−/− mice. Genotyping for all mouse strains was conducted by GeneTyper (NY).

The mouse model used in the study was subjected to a period of entrainment for at least 2 weeks within circadian cabinets (Actimetrics) to establish a stable circadian rhythm42. After this acclimatization period, the mice underwent an in situ procedure for myocardial IRI at different times of day (ZT2, ZT8, ZT14 or ZT20), as described in previous publications27,29,30,50,52. In brief, the mice were anaesthetized using 1–3% isoflurane delivered by a compact small-animal anaesthesia device (RWD), followed by endotracheal intubation and ventilation using a VentStar Small Animal Ventilator (RWD). Once anaesthetized, the mice were placed into a supine position and received pre-incisional analgesia with sustained-release buprenorphine (0.1 mg per kg, subcutaneous; ZooPharm). Throughout the procedure, their body temperature was consistently maintained at 37 °C with a ThermoStar Homeothermic Blanket equipped with rectal feedback control (RWD). The surgical procedure was meticulously performed using a research stereomicroscope system, SZX10 (Olympus). We temporarily ligated the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery approximately 2 mm from its emergence beneath the left atrium, using Surgipro II 7–0 monofilament polypropylene sutures (Covidien). The success of this ligation was confirmed by observing blanching or a pale discolouration of the anterior wall of the heart, a reduction in wall movement and the presence of ST-segment elevation on an electrocardiogram (ECG). After 45 min of induced ischaemia, reperfusion was initiated to restore the blood flow. The effectiveness of reperfusion was verified both by the resolution of ST-segment elevation on the ECG and through direct visual inspection, where a return of colour and movement in the previously affected area of the heart was noted. After surgery, the mice were carefully transferred back to the circadian cabinets for recovery and continued observation. Any mice that did not survive within the first 48 h after MI were considered to have experienced technical complications and were consequently excluded from further analysis. Blinding was implemented for the individuals analysing the data, including those calculating infarct size and measuring serum troponin I levels, to ensure unbiased data interpretation. However, blinding the surgeons performing the surgeries was logistically challenging due to the nature of the procedures. Despite this, the surgeries were carried out by experienced surgeons, ensuring consistency. To confirm the similarity of conditions, we calculated the AAR/LV, which showed comparable values across ZT and treatment/vehicle groups. This suggests that any differences observed in the study are largely due to experimental conditions rather than variations in the surgical procedure.

All cell lines and primary cells used in this study, including HEK293 cells (ATCC, CRL-1573) and human primary cardiomyocytes (ScienCell Research Laboratories, 6200), were authenticated by short-tandem-repeat profiling, as performed by the manufacturers. Moreover, the cell lines were tested for mycoplasma contamination by the manufacturers and were subsequently tested monthly for potential contamination throughout the study. All mycoplasma contamination tests yielded negative results. Furthermore, none of the cell lines used in this study are listed in the database of commonly misidentified cell lines maintained by the International Cell Line Authentication Committee (ICLAC) and NCBI Biosample.

To simulate the clinical scenario in which treatment is initiated after the onset of MI, mouse recombinant AREG protein (R&D Systems) was prepared in 0.9% NaCl solution, and a dosage of 10 µg AREG was administered at the start of the reperfusion phase. Furthermore, to assess the long-term effects of timed AREG treatment on cardiac function, a post-injury treatment regimen was implemented. In this protocol, AREG (10 µg) was administered through i.p. injection at either ZT8 or ZT20 daily for the first 3 days after myocardial IRI. For control purposes, an equivalent volume of 0.9% NaCl solution was administered as a vehicle.

In the NOB treatment experiments, Mice were administered either DMSO (as a vehicle control) or NOB at a dose of 200 mg per kg body weight. The administration was carried out through i.p. injection and repeated on an every-other-day basis. This treatment protocol was followed for 2 weeks before the surgical procedure and was specifically timed within the ZT14–ZT20 time window. To evaluate the long-term effects of NOB on cardiac function and remodelling, the same dosing regimen was continued after IRI. The chosen dosing regimen was based on several considerations: first, the dosage range was consistent with those used in previous studies (100–200 mg per kg per day)42,53, and it was aligned with the active phase of the mice. Second, daily dosing was intentionally avoided to prevent the entrainment of the experimental mice to the dosing schedule as an artificial zeitgeber. Third, previous single-dose pharmacokinetic assays demonstrated a favourable pharmacokinetic profile for NOB, with significant exposure detected in the serum, brain and liver42. Considering that NOB levels were typically undetectable within 8–24 h after administration42,54, we opted for an every-other-day dosing strategy to prevent incomplete clearance over the 4-week experimental period.

The AAR of the heart was collected after 2 h of reperfusion from the C57BL/6J mice subjected to myocardial IRI at either ZT8 or ZT20. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and was used to construct RNA-seq libraries, which were then sequenced using the Illumina 1.9 platform (75 bp paired end). Alignment of RNA sequencing tags was restricted to those mapping to the same DNA strand as annotated in the GRCm38 reference genome, using STAR (v.2.7.10a). Quantification of transcripts was conducted by calculating the fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) values, along with transcript counts. In the preprocessing step of mRNA analysis, any gene identified as non-expressed, defined as having an FPKM expression level less than 1 in more than 80% of samples, was excluded. The normalized expression profiles of these mRNAs were then subjected to PCA for quality control and to evaluate sample similarity. Differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq255 pipeline, with DEGs being identified based on a threshold of 1.5-fold change and an adjusted P < 0.05, as determined using the Benjamini–Hochberg method56.

The functional enrichment analysis of the identified DEGs was conducted using the GO and KEGG pathway databases with the WebGestalt tool57 (http://www.webgestalt.org/; v.2019). For rigorous validation, only pathways and GO terms with an adjusted P < 0.05 were included. In constructing the gene regulation network, we used known transcription factor (TF)–mRNA interactions from the TRRUST_v258 and Chipbase_v259 databases. Moreover, the mouse protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was integrated from the STRING database (v.11.5)60, with a focus on interactions having a combined score above 900. Considering the limited sample size at each timepoint, we merged six samples from both conditions to calculate the Spearman's correlation coefficient (SCC), ensuring robust and meaningful analysis. In finalizing the gene regulation network, we merged the TF–mRNA regulation network with the PPI data, specifically targeting interactions where both genes were differentially expressed. We also selectively incorporated edges with high SCC into our network, tailored to align with the specific conditions of our experimental design.

For human RNA-seq and subsequent bioinformatic analysis, we began by excluding outlier samples that failed to cluster appropriately, resulting in a total of 73 samples for analysis, including 56 morning and 17 afternoon samples derived from various sequencing protocols. Quality control of raw sequencing reads identified adaptor sequences from the Illumina Nextera platform in some samples, which were subsequently trimmed using Cutadapt (v.4.1)61. kallisto (v.0.46.1)62 was used to quantify transcript-level expression by mapping to a transcript index built from GENCODE human transcript (v.44)63. We next used tximport to convert these transcript-level quantifications to gene read counts64. Differential expression analysis was performed with DESeq2 (v.1.34.0)55, with particular attention paid to sequencing batch to control for batch effects. Genes displaying a log2-transformed fold change of greater than 0.5 and P < 0.01 were deemed to be significant. For enrichment analysis, we used the GO annotation (v.1.1) for humans, using all genes annotated by at least one GO term65 as the background in Fisher's exact test to identify over-represented biological processes. Moreover, the R package KEGGREST (v.1.36.0) was used to extract KEGG pathway annotations, and Cytoscape (v.3.10.0) was used to construct network plots for the identified KEGG pathways.

The microarray assay for gene expression transcript levels of post-ischaemic myocardium from myosin-Cre+ or Hif2aloxP/loxP myosin-Cre+ mice was reanalysed using data obtained from the GEO (GSE67308)16. Differential expression analysis was performed using GEO2R, with limma precision weights applied and the remaining options set to default66.

The assessment of myocardial infarct size was conducted by determining the percentage of infarcted myocardium within the AAR using a previously established method16,27,29,30,50. After 2 h or 1 day of reperfusion, the hearts were flushed with PBS and then subjected to permanent occlusion of the left coronary artery. 1 ml of 1% Evans blue dye (Sigma-Aldrich, E2129) was then infused through the carotid artery catheter. After infusion, the hearts were excised and sectioned into 1 mm slices using a microtome (Roboz, SA-4130). These heart sections were subsequently double-stained with 1% TTC (Sigma-Aldrich, T8877) for 10 min at 37 °C and then fixed in 10% formalin overnight. The double-stained heart slices were photographed, and ImageJ software (NIH, Fiji v.2.1.0) was used to calculate the infarct size.

Serum samples were collected from mice subjected to myocardial IRI at various ZTs through the inferior vena cava after 2 h of reperfusion. The measurement of serum troponin I, a highly sensitive biomarker for cardiac injury, was conducted using the mouse cardiac troponin-I SPARCL kit (Life Diagnostics, CTNI-SP-1), as we have done previously16,27,29,30,50.

Cardiac function and structure were assessed by transthoracic echocardiography using the Vevo3100 Ultrasound system (VisualSonics). Mice were lightly sedated with 0.5–1.0% isoflurane and positioned on a heated platform equipped with ECG monitoring. Validation criteria included consistent, uninterrupted tracking of the endocardium throughout the cardiac cycles, maintaining a heart rate between 450 and 550 beats per minute, and a frame rate exceeding 250 fps. Two-dimensional grey-scale echocardiographic images were obtained from parasternal long-axis and short-axis views. Longitudinal strain represented myocardial shortening at the endocardium, while radial strain indicated shortening at the mesocardium. All image acquisitions and subsequent offline measurements were conducted by a single investigator who was blinded to the grouping of the animals.

For strain analysis using Vevo LAB (FUJIFILM VisualSonics, v.5.7.1), we carefully selected suitable B-mode loops, ensuring a clear view of the endocardial border and no image artefacts. Three consecutive cardiac cycles with distinct ECG recordings were chosen for in-depth analysis. Semi-automated tracing of the endocardial and epicardial borders was performed, with adjustments made as necessary to maintain optimal tracking quality throughout each cine loop. The tracked images were then processed frame by frame for strain measurements34,67,68. The resulting strain values were averaged across these cardiac cycles, providing comprehensive data on the LV systolic function (EF, FS and GLS), LV size (end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume) and LV mass (end-diastolic LV mass and end-systolic LV mass).

In analysing regional and global cardiac dynamics, such as contractility and synchronicity, the LV endocardium was delineated using 48 sampling points34,67. This method divided the chamber into six segments for detailed examination in the long-axis view: basal anterior, mid anterior, apical anterior, basal posterior, mid posterior and apical posterior segments67. In myocardial IRI models, the mid anterior, apical anterior and apical posterior wall segments were designated as the infarct region, and the remaining segments were categorized as the non-infarct region34. Peak systolic strain, indicating the percentage change in length during myocardial contraction and relaxation, was calculated using the formula: ε = (L1 − L0)/L0, where L0 is the initial length and L1 is the final length69. This calculation was applied to each segment to evaluate the peak systolic strain (%) and the time-to-peak systolic strain (ms). Abnormal ventricular contractility patterns were evaluated on the basis of the magnitude of systolic strain (segment peak strain) and its timing (peak of shortening). Dyssynchrony was specifically identified by a pattern of reduced systolic strain magnitude, early opposing deflection and a delayed time-to-peak systole. Akinesis was defined as minimal or no contractility, with peak systolic strain values between −5% and 5%. Dyskinesis was described as systolic motion of the ventricle occurring in the opposite direction of normal contraction. Moreover, intraventricular disparity was measured by assessing the intraventricular delay in the time-to-peak strain and the s.d. of the time-to-peak strain across segments34,70.

HCMs were obtained from ScienCell Research Laboratories (ScienCell, 6200) and isolated from human hearts71. The cells were synchronized using 200 nM dexamethasone, which was replaced with complete media (ScienCell, 6101) after 1 h. After synchronization, we initiated a series of hypoxia treatments, exposing different batches of cells to 1% oxygen for 4 h at systematic 4-h intervals to capture cellular responses at various circadian phases. The first hypoxia session started immediately after synchronization (CT0) and lasted for 4 h (referred to as the CT4 timepoint). Subsequent treatments were applied every 4 h: from CT4 to CT8 (CT8 timepoint), and so on, continuing up to CT40. Immediately after each hypoxia period, cells were collected to evaluate transcript and protein levels.

To ensure valid results, we carefully selected timepoints for post-synchronization analysis. After synchronization, cells require a stabilization period to re-establish their circadian rhythms, and early evaluations may capture this adjustment phase rather than true circadian behaviour72. Moreover, dexamethasone induces immediate stress responses and activates signalling pathways unrelated to circadian changes73,74. Administering hypoxia treatments too soon after synchronization could overlap these stress responses, confounding the circadian-related changes we aim to measure. For this reason, early timepoints like CT8 were excluded, and we focused on later timepoints to minimize these effects and ensure that the data reflect circadian-driven changes.

HCMs were synchronized by dexamethasone (200 nM) for 1 h and then exposed to normoxia or hypoxia (1% oxygen) for 4 h at CT20 and CT32 in Fig. 3q. HEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-mBmal1 (a gift from A. Sancar, Addgene, 31367)75 and treated with normoxia or hypoxia (1% oxygen) for 4 h in Fig. 3s. ChIP–qPCR was conducted using the SimpleChIP enzymatic chromatin IP kit (Cell Signaling Technology, 9002). In brief, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, quenched with 125 mM glycine, washed and sonicated to digest the DNA to an average length of 150–500 bp. Lysates were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 µg of ChIP grade anti-HIF2A antibody (Novus Biologicals, NB100-122) and anti-BMAL1 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 14020), anti-HIF1B antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 5537) or IgG as a negative control. After washing, the antibody–protein–DNA complexes were eluted from the beads. The cross-links were then reversed through overnight incubation at 65 °C, followed by DNA purification. For the qPCR analysis, specific primer pairs were designed to amplify the predicted common binding sequence (CAGGTG) on the human AREG promoter region or E-box regions on the human HIF2A promoter region. The enrichment was quantitatively compared against input controls and IgG negative controls to confirm the specificity of the ChIP-qPCR assay.

HEK293 cell lines (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 2b) overexpressing the pcDNA3-mBmal1 (a gift from A. Sancar, Addgene, 31367)75 were exposed to either normoxia or hypoxia (1% oxygen) for 4 h. In Fig. 3r, HCMs were initially synchronized using dexamethasone (200 nM) for 1 h and then exposed to hypoxia (1% oxygen) for 4 h at CT20 and CT32. After exposure, the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were separately extracted using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78835), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cell lysates were centrifuged and pre-cleared with protein A/G beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 53133) for 1 h with rotation. For the IP, the pre-cleared lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with specific antibodies: mouse anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich, F1804) or rabbit anti-HIF2A (Novus Biologicals, NB100-122) antibodies. Mouse IgG (Cell Signaling Technology, 5415) and rabbit IgG (Abcam, ab172730) were used as isotype controls for the respective antibodies. After the overnight incubation, 40 μl of protein A/G beads were added to each sample, and the incubation was continued for an additional 4 h at 4 °C. The proteins were then eluted using an SDS sample buffer and subjected to heating at 95 °C for 5 min with vigorous shaking. The eluted proteins were subsequently stored at −80 °C for further analysis. In Fig. 2d, HCMs were subjected to hypoxic conditions (1% oxygen) for various durations: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 or 8 h. After each exposure period, HCMs from a single 10-cm dish were lysed using 330 µl of HEPES extraction buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, and a cocktail of protease, phosphatase and RNase inhibitors. Co-IP was then performed according to the previously described protocol. In Extended Data Fig. 7w,x, HEK293 cells were transfected with UB–HA, HIF2A–MYC or BMAL1–Flag expression constructs. To assess the ubiquitination of HIF2A, cells were treated with 10 µM MG132 for 16 h. After treatment, the cells were collected and lysed using HEPES extraction buffer. Immunoprecipitation was then performed using rabbit anti-HIF2A antibodies (Novus, NB100-122) as previously described.

HCMs were transduced with Bmal1-AAV (105 GC per cell) or shBMAL1-AAV (105 GC per cell) and exposed to 1% O2 for 4 h to stabilize HIF1A and HIF2A. After the return to normoxic conditions, CHX (20 μg ml−1, Sigma-Aldrich, C4859) was added to inhibit de novo protein synthesis. Cells were collected at 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after CHX treatment, washed with cold PBS, and lysed in RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After centrifugation, protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay kit. Equal amounts of protein (10–20 μg) were separated by SDS–PAGE and probed with primary antibodies against HIF2A (Novus Biologicals, NB100-122, 1:1,000), HIF1A (Novus Biologicals, NB100-479, 1:1,000), BMAL1 (Cell Signaling Technology, 14020, 1:1,000) and β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, 4967, 1:1,000). The relative protein levels at each timepoint were quantified using ImageJ (NIH, v.2.1.0) and normalized to β-actin as a loading control. For each experimental group, normalized protein levels at 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min were expressed as the percentage of the 0-min timepoint (set as 100%). The degradation rates of the proteins were then plotted as the percentage of remaining protein over time.

Confluent HCMs were subjected to hypoxic conditions (1% oxygen) for various durations (0, 1, 4 or 8 h). After exposure, the cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (Millipore Sigma, P6148), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Amresco, M143), and subjected to a blocking step to reduce non-specific binding. Rabbit anti-BMAL1 (Abcam, ab3350, 1:100), mouse anti-HIF2A (Novus Biologicals, NB100-132, 1:100) and mouse anti-HIF1A (Novus Biologicals, NB100-105, 1:100) were then applied. For PLA, pairs of primary antibodies raised in different species were used as mentioned. After primary antibody incubation, cells were treated with Duolink In Situ PLA Probes (Millipore Sigma, DUO92002 and DUO92004) conjugated to these antibodies. These probes, when in close proximity of less than 40 nm, facilitated the ligation of adjacent oligonucleotides attached to them. Subsequently, the ligated oligonucleotides were amplified and detected using fluorescently labelled probes. The resulting fluorescence signals, which are indicative of PPIs, were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 confocal microscope (Nikon) and analysed with NIS Element AR software (Nikon, v6.10.01). To confirm the specificity of the observed interactions, control experiments were performed using only the BMAL1 antibody.

To overexpress proteins in Escherichia coli, the DNA sequences encoding the N-terminal portions of mouse HIF2A (residues 3–361) and mouse HIF1A (residues 13–357), with a 6×His tag at their N terminus, were inserted into the pET15b vector. The DNA encoding the N-terminal region of mouse BMAL1 protein (residues 68–488), with a C-terminal Flag tag, was ligated into the pET24b vector.

For GST pull-down, the DNA encoding residues 3–361 of mouse HIF2A was inserted into pGEX-6P-1 to generate GST–HIF2A for expression. Six BMAL1 single-site mutants (L95E, L115E, L150E, F248D, R343A and F423D) and three double-site mutants (L95E/L115E, L150E/F248D and R343A/F423D) were generated using site-directed mutagenesis. The DNA sequences of all of the mutants were verified by DNA sequencing.

The recombinant plasmids were individually transformed into E. coli BL21 Rosetta (DE3) or co-transformed together to express either individual proteins or the BMAL1–HIF2A complex. Expression of the proteins or BMAL1–HIF2A complex was carried out at 18 °C by induction with 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 16 h. The BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimer (including bHLH, PAS-A and PAS-B domains) was first purified through a Ni-NTA affinity column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 88222) followed by heparin chromatography. The heterodimer eluted from the heparin column was further analysed by size-exclusion chromatography using the Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column. The peak fractions were assessed using SDS–PAGE and Coomassie blue staining. Subsequently, the samples were combined and concentrated. The concentrated protein was then used for cryo-EM sample preparation or stored at −80 °C for further use. His–HIF2A and His–HIF1A were purified individually using Ni-NTA affinity columns, followed by dialysis to eliminate imidazole. The proteins were concentrated and stored at −80 °C for further use.

To confirm the interaction between BMAL1 and HIF2A or HIF1A in Fig. 2h, BMAL1-expressing cells were lysed using binding buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, and protease inhibitors). After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with anti-Flag M2 beads (Millipore Sigma, A2220) for 40 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, the beads were washed three times using the binding buffer, followed by the addition of purified His–HIF2A or His–HIF1A proteins. After incubation for 40 min at 4 °C, the beads were washed five times using the binding buffer. The proteins bound to beads were then eluted using Flag peptide (0.3 mg ml−1) and further analysed by SDS–PAGE and western blotting using anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich, F1804, 1:1,000) and anti-His (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA1-21315, 1:1,000) antibodies.

To compare the interactions between HIF2A and WT BMAL1 or BMAL1 mutants in Fig. 5e, the cell pellets of GST–HIF2A and GST (as a control) were lysed by sonication in binding buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and protease inhibitors). After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with Glutathione magnetic agarose beads (GE Healthcare, 17-0756-01) for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were subsequently washed three times using the binding buffer, followed by the addition of Flag-tagged WT or mutated BMAL1. After 40 min incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed five times using the binding buffer. The proteins bound to beads were eluted by heating with SDS–PAGE loading dye at 95 °C. The eluted samples were further analysed by SDS–PAGE and western blotting using anti-GST (Genscript, A00865, 1:1,000) and anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich, F1804, 1:1,000) antibodies.

Five fmol of 22-bp biotin-labelled dsDNA fragment containing an HRE consensus sequence was incubated with 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 pmol of purified BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimer in a total volume of 10 µl in 10 mM MES (pH 6.0), 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 2.5% glycerol, 0.05% NP-40 and 5 mM MgCl2. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, the binding reactions were directly loaded onto a native 4–20% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed in 0.5× TBE buffer. DNA on the gel was transferred onto a positively charged nylon membrane and detected using an HRP-conjugated streptavidin with chemiluminescent substrates.

The interaction analysis of the BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimer with 22-bp DNA duplexes (HRE or E-box) was performed using OpenSPR (Nicoya Life Sciences). A 5′-end biotin-labelled dsDNA fragment (2 μM) containing either an HRE or E-box consensus sequence was immobilized in channel 2 of the biotin–streptavidin sensor, while channel 1 remained unmodified and served as a control. The BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimer at various concentrations (from 5 to 50 nM) was injected and flowed slowly at a rate of 20 μl min−1 over the sensor chip for 5 min in a running buffer (20 mM MES pH 5.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, 0.02% BSA). After the injection, a 10-min dissociation phase was collected. The resulting data were analysed using Trace Drawer Kinetic Data Analysis software (v.1.9.2), using a one-to-one model, which assumes one monovalent ligand binding to one target.

To assess the transcriptional activation activity of HIF2A and BMAL1 on the promoter of human AREG, the 3 × 300 bp sequences (−300/0) from the human AREG promoter harbouring the common binding sequence (CAGGTG) were PCR-amplified and cloned into the pEZX-PG04-promoter luciferase vector to generate GLuc-hAREG. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with several constructs: pcDNA3-mHif2a-P405A/P530V/N851A (oxygen-regulation insensitive, a gift from C. Simon, Addgene, 44027)76, pcDNA3-mBmal1 (a gift from A. Sancar, Addgene, 31367)75, hAREG-gluc and SEAP vectors (GeneCopoeia, LF031). Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Invitrogen, L3000015). After 48 h, the culture medium was collected, and the transcriptional activity was quantified using the Secrete-pair Dual Luminescence Assay Kit (GeneCopoeia, LF031) on the Cytation5 (Agilent Technologies) device with Gen5 software (v.3.12, Agilent Technologies). To investigate the transcriptional activity of HIF2A and BMAL1 on a general HIF target gene, HEK293 cells were transfected with the hPGK1-luc reporter (a gift from C. V. Dang, Addgene plasmid, 128095) along with HIF2A or BMAL1 expression constructs. After 48 h of transfection, firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, E1690). The luciferase activity was detected on the Cytation5 (Agilent Technologies) system and analysed using Gen5 software (v.3.12, Agilent Technologies).

On day 1 after MI, collected heart tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and then dehydrated through a graded alcohol series. After dehydration, the tissues were cleared in xylene and embedded in paraffin blocks. Sections of 5–6-μm thickness were prepared and underwent antigen retrieval. These sections were then blocked with diluted donkey serum, followed by overnight incubation with primary antibodies at 4 °C. In the immunofluorescence staining process, a range of primary antibodies was used to specifically target and identify various proteins within the tissue sections. These primary antibodies included: AREG (Santa Cruz, sc-74501, 1:50), HIF2A (Novus Biologicals, NB100-122, 1:200; Novus Biologicals, NB100-132, 1:200), BMAL1 (Abcam, ab3350, 1:200), α-sarcomeric (Abcam, ab137346, 1:200), vimentin (Cell Signaling Technology, 5741, 1:200), and α-smooth muscle actin (Cell Signaling Technology, 19245, 1:200) antibodies. For antigen visualization, the sections were then incubated with Alexa fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Moreover, TUNEL staining was conducted using in situ Click-iT Plus TUNEL assay kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific, C10617) according to the manufacturer's protocol to detect apoptotic cells as previously described77. The samples were counterstained with DAPI (1 μg ml−1, Invitrogen, D3571) and mounted using SlowFade Gold Antifade reagent (Invitrogen, S36936). The stained sections were then imaged with Nikon Eclipse Ti2 confocal microscopy (Nikon) and analysed using ImageJ software (NIH, Fiji v.2.1.0).

Total RNA was extracted from both tissue samples and isolated cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, 74106) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. This procedure is consistent with our established protocols as described in previous publications16,29,50. After the extraction, cDNA was synthesized from the extracted RNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 4368814). qPCR was then performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, 204145). The reactions were performed on the Bio-Rad CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System. For the analysis of gene expression levels, we applied the comparative Ct (ΔΔCt) method. The final data were presented as mean expression ratios relative to β-actin, allowing for the comparison of gene expression across different samples.

Mouse tissues and isolated cells were prepared for western blot analysis by lysing in RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 89900), supplemented with both protease (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78425) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78420). Protein concentrations were quantified, and 10–20 μg of total protein was separated on 4–12% SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories). After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to membranes for immunoblotting. The membranes were probed with the following primary antibodies: anti-HIF1A (Novus, NB100-105, 1:1,000), anti-HIF2A (Novus, NB100-122, 1:1,000), anti-HIF2A (Bethyl Laboratories, A700-003, 1:1,000), anti-HIF1A (Bethyl Laboratories, A700-001, 1:1,000), anti-HIF1B (Cell Signaling Technology, 5537. 1:2,000), anti-BMAL1 (Cell Signaling Technology, 14020, 1:2,000), anti-CLOCK (Cell Signaling Technology, 5157, 1:1,000), anti-RORα (Abcam, ab60134, 1:1,000), anti-AREG (Santa Cruz, sc-74501, 1:1,000), anti-caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9662, 1:1,000), anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9661, 1:1,000), anti-Bax (Cell Signaling Technology, 2772, 1:1,000), anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich, F1804, 1:1,000), anti-ubiquitin (Santa Cruz, sc-8017, 1:1,000), anti-lamin B1 (Cell Signaling Technology, 12586, 1:2,000), anti-lamin A/C (Cell Signaling Technology, 4777, 1:2,000), anti-TBP (Cell Signaling Technology, 8515, 1:1,000), anti-α-tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology, 2144, 1:2,000) and anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz, 47778, 1:2,000). After incubation with secondary antibodies, the membranes were developed using appropriate substrates. The signal intensity was detected and quantified using ImageJ software (NIH, Fiji v.2.1.0). The results were normalized to the appropriate internal control, and data were expressed as the relative fold changes in protein levels.

The purified BMAL1–HIF2A heterodimer was mixed with a twofold molar excess of the HRE dsDNA, followed by incubation on ice for 20 min. The mixture was then applied onto the Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column. The eluate fractions from the column were analysed by SDS–PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue. The peak fractions corresponding to the BMAL1–HIF2A–DNA complex were combined and concentrated to 0.5 mg ml−1 for preparing cryo-EM specimens. In brief, 3 μl of the purified complex was applied onto freshly glow-discharged R 2/1 holey carbon 300 mesh copper grids (C-flat). The grids were then vitrified in liquid ethane using an FEI Vitrobot (Mark IV).

Single-particle cryo-EM images were collected using the FEI Titan Krios (300 KV) electron microscope with a Gatan GIF Quantum K2 direct electron detector. The images were automatically acquired using EPU (Thermo Fisher Scientific, v.2.10) at underfocus values ranging from 1.0 to 2.5 μm with a pixel size of 0.85 Å px−1. Each micrograph was exposed for 9 s with a total dose of about 75 e− Å−2, which was fractionated into 45 frames. The movie frames were aligned using MotionCor2 (v.1.4.0)78, resulting in a total of 18,039 micrographs. Gctf (v.1.18)79 was used to estimate the parameters of contrast transfer function (CTF) for each micrograph. crYOLO (v.1.10)80 was used for reference-free automatic particle picking, yielding a total of approximately 710,000 particles. The particles were extracted with a box size of 352. Multiple rounds of Cryosparc (v.-2.5)81 2D classification were initially performed to remove junk particles. Next, the remaining particles were subjected to an additional round of 2D classification using RELION (v.3.1)82, yielding a stack of 420,000 particles. An ab initio model, showing secondary structural features bound to DNA, was generated using CryoSPARC and then used as a reference for subsequent 3D analysis. Multiple rounds of 3D classification were performed in RELION, resulting in 141,218 particles. The particles were rescaled to a pixel size of 1.02 Å px−1 with a box size of 328 pixels and subsequently subjected to 3D refinement. The reference map for 3D refinement was filtered to 25 Å, and a low-pass filtered mask at 25 Å was generated using a threshold that included the protein and DNA regions, followed by a 4-pixel dilation and 5-pixel soft padding. 3D refinement in RELION produced a 4.7 Å-resolution map of the BMAL1–HIF2A–DNA complex. Next, these particles were further processed by CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing in RELION, resulting in 141,218 shiny particles. These particles were then subjected to 3D refinement, producing a map with a resolution of 4.3 Å. Multiple rounds of 3D classification, with and without alignment, were then conducted. A final set of 43,098 shiny particles was used for 3D refinement, resulting in a map with an average resolution of 3.6 Å. The resolution was calculated using a low-pass filtered mask at 15 Å, created with a threshold of 0.008, a 3-pixel dilation and 3-pixel soft padding. The b-factor for the RELION map was −61. The final map was sharpened using DeepEMhancer (v.0.14) with the wideTarget training mode83. The local resolutions were calculated using CryoSPARC. The resolutions of the 3D maps were estimated using gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) curves with a 0.143 cut-off criteria84. The directional resolution anisotropy was quantified by the 3D FSC algorithm (v.3.0)85. The final set of 43,098 particles had an Eod value of 0.74 with the best and worst PSF resolutions of 2.8 and 5.3 Å, respectively, as calculated by cryoEF (v.1.1.0)86, indicating minor anisotropy. The cryo-EM data collection and image analysis procedures are shown in Supplementary Table 11 and Extended Data Fig. 9, respectively.

To build an atomic model of the BMAL1–HIF2A–DNA complex, the crystal structure of HIF2A (Protein Data Bank (PDB): 4ZP4) and a 22-bp B-form DNA duplex were used as templates and fitted into the deepEMhancer map of BMAL1–HIF2A–DNA by rigid-body fitting in Chimera (v.1.15)87. Owing to the structural arrangement, the bHLH, PAS-A and PAS-B domains of the BMAL1 crystal structure (PDB: 4F3L) were individually fitted into the map. The model was then manually built and adjusted in Coot (v.1.1)88, followed by real-space refinement in Phenix (v.1.21)89 (Supplementary Table 11). In the final BMAL1–HIF2A–DNA atomic model, amino acids for HIF2A (3–12, 76–88, 151–163, 174–185, 201–219 and 356–361) and BMAL1 (68–74, 102–110, 126–144, 164–167, 210–242, 254–279, 291–311, 321–337, 345–349, 407–412 and 441–488) as well as a four DNA bases near the terminal ends were not built because of missing or poor densities. The refined model statics are shown in Supplementary Table 11. All molecular graphic figures were generated by Chimera, ChimeraX (v.1.7)90 and PyMOL (v.2.5.5)91.

Unless otherwise specified, all results are presented as the mean ± s.e.m., with the precise number of biological replicates (n) described in the figure legends. All data were plotted from independent biological replicates. The Shapiro–Wilk normality test was used to assess normal distribution. The equality of variances for unpaired t-tests was determined using the F-test. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 10.0, using unpaired t-tests (two-tailed), Welch's t-tests (for unequal variances), Mann–Whitney U-tests (when normality assumptions were not met) or one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's multiple-comparison analysis, depending on the dataset. Outliers were identified using the ROUT method (Q = 1%) in GraphPad Prism. For ChIP–qPCR data analysis in Fig. 3s, values identified as outliers were excluded from the statistical analysis. Cardiac function assessment in Bmal1loxP/loxP myosin-Cre+, Hif2aloxP/loxP myosin-Cre+ and Hif1aloxP/loxP myosin-Cre+ mice was compared to a shared myosin-Cre+ control group. Cardiac function data from Bmal1loxP/loxP myosin-Cre+ mice were used as the control for comparing NOB-treated Bmal1loxP/loxP myosin-Cre+ mice. Similarly, cardiac function data from Areg−/− mice were used as the control for comparing NOB-treated Areg−/− mice. Cardiac function data from C57BL/6J mice were partially used as the control group for Areg−/− mice. This strategy minimized animal use and ensured a consistent baseline, optimizing research efficiency while enabling reliable comparative analysis.

Margaret Mitchell is a pioneer when it comes to testing generative AI tools for bias. She founded the Ethical AI team at Google, alongside another well-known researcher, Timnit Gebru, before they were later both fired from the company. She now works as the AI ethics leader at Hugging Face, a software startup focused on open source tools.

We spoke about a new dataset she helped create to test how AI models continue perpetuating stereotypes. Unlike most bias-mitigation efforts that prioritize English, this dataset is malleable, with human translations for testing a wider breadth of languages and cultures. You probably already know that AI often presents a flattened view of humans, but you might not realize how these issues can be made even more extreme when the outputs are no longer generated in English.

My conversation with Mitchell has been edited for length and clarity.

Reece Rogers: What is this new dataset, called SHADES, designed to do, and how did it come together?

Margaret Mitchell: It's designed to help with evaluation and analysis, coming about from the BigScience project. About four years ago, there was this massive international effort, where researchers all over the world came together to train the first open large language model. By fully open, I mean the training data is open as well as the model.

Hugging Face played a key role in keeping it moving forward and providing things like compute. Institutions all over the world were paying people as well while they worked on parts of this project. The model we put out was called Bloom, and it really was the dawn of this idea of “open science.”

We had a bunch of working groups to focus on different aspects, and one of the working groups that I was tangentially involved with was looking at evaluation. It turned out that doing societal impact evaluations well was massively complicated—more complicated than training the model.

We had this idea of an evaluation dataset called SHADES, inspired by Gender Shades, where you could have things that are exactly comparable, except for the change in some characteristic. Gender Shades was looking at gender and skin tone. Our work looks at different kinds of bias types and swapping amongst some identity characteristics, like different genders or nations.

There are a lot of resources in English and evaluations for English. While there are some multilingual resources relevant to bias, they're often based on machine translation as opposed to actual translations from people who speak the language, who are embedded in the culture, and who can understand the kind of biases at play. They can put together the most relevant translations for what we're trying to do.

So much of the work around mitigating AI bias focuses just on English and stereotypes found in a few select cultures. Why is broadening this perspective to more languages and cultures important?

These models are being deployed across languages and cultures, so mitigating English biases—even translated English biases—doesn't correspond to mitigating the biases that are relevant in the different cultures where these are being deployed. This means that you risk deploying a model that propagates really problematic stereotypes within a given region, because they are trained on these different languages.

So, there's the training data. Then, there's the fine-tuning and evaluation. The training data might contain all kinds of really problematic stereotypes across countries, but then the bias mitigation techniques may only look at English. In particular, it tends to be North American– and US-centric. While you might reduce bias in some way for English users in the US, you've not done it throughout the world. You still risk amplifying really harmful views globally because you've only focused on English.

Is generative AI introducing new stereotypes to different languages and cultures?

That is part of what we're finding. The idea of blondes being stupid is not something that's found all over the world, but is found in a lot of the languages that we looked at.

When you have all of the data in one shared latent space, then semantic concepts can get transferred across languages. You're risking propagating harmful stereotypes that other people hadn't even thought of.

Is it true that AI models will sometimes justify stereotypes in their outputs by just making shit up?

That was something that came out in our discussions of what we were finding. We were all sort of weirded out that some of the stereotypes were being justified by references to scientific literature that didn't exist.

Outputs saying that, for example, science has shown genetic differences where it hasn't been shown, which is a basis of scientific racism. The AI outputs were putting forward these pseudo-scientific views, and then also using language that suggested academic writing or having academic support. It spoke about these things as if they're facts, when they're not factual at all.

What were some of the biggest challenges when working on the SHADES dataset?

One of the biggest challenges was around the linguistic differences. A really common approach for bias evaluation is to use English and make a sentence with a slot like: “People from [nation] are untrustworthy.” Then, you flip in different nations.

When you start putting in gender, now the rest of the sentence starts having to agree grammatically on gender. That's really been a limitation for bias evaluation, because if you want to do these contrastive swaps in other languages—which is super useful for measuring bias—you have to have the rest of the sentence changed. You need different translations where the whole sentence changes.

How do you make templates where the whole sentence needs to agree in gender, in number, in plurality, and all these different kinds of things with the target of the stereotype? We had to come up with our own linguistic annotation in order to account for this. Luckily, there were a few people involved who were linguistic nerds.

So, now you can do these contrastive statements across all of these languages, even the ones with the really hard agreement rules, because we've developed this novel, template-based approach for bias evaluation that's syntactically sensitive.

Generative AI has been known to amplify stereotypes for a while now. With so much progress being made in other aspects of AI research, why are these kinds of extreme biases still prevalent? It's an issue that seems under-addressed.

That's a pretty big question. There are a few different kinds of answers. One is cultural. I think within a lot of tech companies it's believed that it's not really that big of a problem. Or, if it is, it's a pretty simple fix. What will be prioritized, if anything is prioritized, are these simple approaches that can go wrong.

We'll get superficial fixes for very basic things. If you say girls like pink, it recognizes that as a stereotype, because it's just the kind of thing that if you're thinking of prototypical stereotypes pops out at you, right? These very basic cases will be handled. It's a very simple, superficial approach where these more deeply embedded beliefs don't get addressed.

It ends up being both a cultural issue and a technical issue of finding how to get at deeply ingrained biases that aren't expressing themselves in very clear language.

China has long been an important market for Tesla and for Elon Musk, but with the new US tariffs and rising competition in the electric vehicle market, Tesla may be on the outs in China. Today on the show, we're joined by senior writer Zeyi Yang to talk about what this means for Elon Musk's company.

Zoë Schiffer: Welcome to WIRED's Uncanny Valley. I'm WIRED's director of business and industry, Zoë Schiffer. Today on the show, Tesla's troubles in China and what it means for Elon Musk's wallet. We're going to talk about how China is the biggest electric-vehicle market in the world and has played a major role in Tesla's growth. But with the US tariffs and rising competition in the country, China may just be done with Tesla. We'll see. I'm joined today by Zeyi Yang, senior writer at WIRED. Zeyi, welcome to the show.

Zeyi Yang: Thanks for having me, Zoë.

Zoë Schiffer: Tesla is scheduled to release its first-quarter earnings today, after a pretty grim quarter for the company's stock price. What are we expecting to see from these results? Because we're recording a few hours before they actually come out.

Zeyi Yang: Exactly. I'm also looking for the result too. But I think we already know that Tesla sales has doing pretty bad in Europe. It may have also been bad in the USA. Really, China may have been one of the last markets where its sales are still doing relatively OK, but we're about to find out. I think from what I saw, the data collected by Chinese industry associates, they're saying that Tesla's doing still OK this year, mostly because they released a new model of their car. But if not for that, maybe it would have went down, too.

Zoë Schiffer: Let's take a bit of a step back, because China has been a really important market for Tesla and for Elon Musk generally. He's a celebrity there, and so is his mom, as you've reported.

Zeyi Yang: Yes, she is.

Zoë Schiffer: Can you talk to me about that relationship? And also, what is Tesla's standing like in China? Is it viewed as a popular, cool car still?

Zeyi Yang: It's still sort of, because for the longest time, Chinese auto brands have been seen as inferior to foreign brands. Tesla still has that halo as this American electric car company. But it's losing it as we speak. Also, when we talk about the relationship between Tesla and China, sometimes I forget how far back it dates. There's one very interesting figure we have to talk about. His name is Zhuanglong. He used to be Chinese minister of industry and information technologies. Basically, the chief ministry of innovations in China. He went to San Francisco in 2008 and tried one of the roadsters, one of the first electric cars that Tesla made. Because he came from the auto industry, he was an electric car nerd. That's how this all started. Then, from Musk's very first visit to China in 2014, he met this guy again. He really tried to push for it to sell his car in China, and later we know he built a Gigafactory in Shanghai in 2020. That's a long history of how Musk and Tesla entered China. But what we know for now is that China is one of the most productive facilities for Tesla. It's also one of the biggest market for Tesla. Tesla absolutely cannot lose China.

Zoë Schiffer: That's fascinating, because we know with other tech companies like Google and Meta, they tried really, really hard to get into China and weren't quite as successful, or completely failed in some cases. But Elon Musk was able to prevail. Do we know why that was?

Zeyi Yang: I think it helps that he's working on a car company instead of a social media company, because there's just so much control over information and the internet in China. Whereas if you're just making a car, it doesn't really go across those red lines that China has. Also, it just helps that China, for the last two decades, has really been thinking, “Maybe I should be betting on electric vehicle as the future of transportation too.” It did welcome Tesla to be a part of its grand experiment, and also investment to build up an EV empire. That's why Tesla become a very central part of it and contributed to what China has achieved so far.

Zoë Schiffer: Well, that leads right into my next question, because China has invested really heavily in electric vehicles. In part, I think, to reduce its dependency on foreign oil imports. How is that going so far?

Zeyi Yang: It's going pretty well, I will say. Yeah. China does not have rich oil reserve, and it has been importing oil from a lot of other places for the longest time. That's why the Chinese government has always been very careful about that, because if, for example, a World War III happens, those oil supply are going to be cut off. What is it going to do? I think in the early days, I will say the early 2000s, the idea of electric vehicles was this moonshot idea. Where they were thinking, “Maybe, if one day all the cars will be powered by electricity, then we don't need to import this oil anymore and we'll be much more secure if war breaks out.” That's when they really started investing in the research of batteries and electric vehicles with college research funds. But then, that gradually led to Chinese companies building up. They heavily subsidize any car company that can make a product that gets to run on the road and customers can buy. All of that, after years of heavy spending, led to what we have right now, which is a booming electric vehicle market in China. I think the latest data says that more than 50 percent of consumers when they're trying to buy a new car, they go for electric rather than a gas car. That's pretty remarkable.

Zoë Schiffer: Yeah, that's really interesting. It's also something we're hearing a lot about now. We're seeing people close to President Trump saying, “Hey, look at China. They really help their homegrown tech companies, and now China seems to be beating us in key markets.” It's this idea that perhaps the US government should have a friendlier relationship with the tech companies that are created in the United States.

Zeyi Yang: Well, I will say it's more of a love and hate relationship between the Chinese government and their homegrown companies, because we definitely have seen the honeymoon eras where they subsidize them, where they get the domestic market and drive out all of the foreign competitors. But also, there are periods, I think around 2020, when they really cracked down on the tech companies like Alibaba and Tencent. It can backfire. The government can help you, but it can also destroy you.

Zoë Schiffer: OK. Who is Tesla's biggest competition in the country right now? Which cars are we seeing become more popular than Tesla?

Zeyi Yang: There are so many, I will say dozens of EV brands in China right now. The leader is probably BYD, just because of its sheer size. A Chinese company that started by making batteries and small electronics, BYD now is I think the biggest electric vehicle company in the world, in terms of the number of cars they sell. Bigger than Tesla. Of course, they're growing in China and they're selling their cars much cheaper and in much more varieties in China. But we're also seeing a few more electric car—I will call say “startups,” because they were funded in the last 10 years or so—but still they are big players in the Chinese market now too. They are Neo, they are Li Auto. These companies have really risen up from having nothing to become big players, pushing affordable and also capable cars to the market now.

Zoë Schiffer: When we hone in on BYD specifically, what is that car like compared to a Tesla? I guess I want your subjective opinion now. Are they better or are they just cheaper?

Zeyi Yang: I think the biggest thing is that they come in more variety. You will get a very cheap car, for example, I don't know, a Toyota Corolla, something similar to that, but in an EV form by BYD. Or if you want a luxury SUV, you want something that you can show off to your friends, BYD offers that too. Where Tesla really only has, what, three models being offered right now? It's hard to compete with them when you know consumers want very different things. The other thing I find really interesting is that because, I guess Chinese EV companies are already pretty confident with the quality of their cars now, they're going for those very niche, very weird applications. They're making cars that can run in water, like turn into a boat. They're making cars that allow you to play computer games, and they even have a hot pot in there. Not everyone's going to use it like that, but maybe someone will see that and be like, “I want a car that allows me to do that once in a year.”

Zoë Schiffer: Oh my gosh. Well, as someone who really liked the show Pimp My Ride on MTV when I was younger, maybe this was what I need in my life. We'll be right back. When we return, what does this mixed economic outlook mean for Elon Musk's wallet?

[break]

Zoë Schiffer: The outlook seems mixed for Elon Musk's future in China, or Tesla's future in China I should say. What does this mean for him, and specifically his overall wealth?

Zeyi Yang: I will say that, first of all, he really wants to make sure the factory in Shanghai keeps producing more cars, because it is the most productive plant in Tesla. He wants it to keep churning out cars. But if the foreign demand doesn't catch up, then what are these cars for? We know right now it's mostly for I would say the European market and also the Chinese domestic market. He's proud that these factories are running 24/7. If that doesn't happen, it would really hurt the Shanghai factory's efficiency, and that would not be good for him.

Zoë Schiffer: Musk is in an interesting position with his business interests in China, particularly as the Trump administration gets more antagonistic toward the Chinese Communist Party. Can you talk about that a little bit? And also, how do you see that playing out?

Zeyi Yang: I think the whole development's very fascinating. One thing I want to mention right now is that, obviously, everyone's talking about the tariffs. The Chinese government and Chinese people hate that Trump is slapping at 145 percent tariff on Chinese imports. Musk actually doesn't like that. He said it publicly on X, that he doesn't think the tariffs are a good idea. That is because if you are a multinational company doing business in US and China, you are going to be impacted by those tariffs. The cars made in the Shanghai factory aren't shipped to the United States, but maybe they're trading car parts in emergencies maybe, or there's some kind of business developed between the countries that will be cut off by these tariffs. That's not good new for him. I think that's a good example to show that, even though we know Musk and Trump are in this very close alliance, there's still diverging interests between them. How to handle business deals with China, how to handle the private sector connections with China, that is one thing I think they will disagree on.

Zoë Schiffer: We know from other reporting that Elon tried to privately lobby Trump against the tariffs on China, and ultimately he appears to have been unsuccessful, at least so far. It's interesting to see it play out, because these men seem very interested in their own bottom line and their own business interests. When those interests align, they get along really well, but China is this point where they seem to diverge, like you said, quite intensely. I'm curious if that will become a breaking point in the relationship, or if they'll be able to resolve their differences.

Zeyi Yang: Yeah. The other thing I want to point out is that, for the longest time, China, both the Chinese people and the government, have really viewed Musk as one of their friends. They came here, helped us prop up the electric vehicle industry, and are still contributing a lot of tax dollars from their Shanghai Tesla factory. Now I think they're figuring out what's their new attitude to Musk. It's like, “He's still doing all of those things. His company is still contributing to our economy.” But at the same time, he's a close ally of Trump who's absolutely wreaking havoc on our economy. What do we see there? When I go on social media and just watch how people comment about Musk, I see a lot of mix there. There's people who still see him as the future of technology. But then there are people who are like, “Why don't you say something about the tariffs?”

Zoë Schiffer: Yeah. It's so interesting. It'll be very curious to see whether his celebrity status starts to fade. Or even, we've seen in the United States and Europe, if this symbol of what a Tesla means, it used to be this very cool, environmental symbol, become something different altogether. We've all seen those bumper stickers that are like, “I bought this Tesla before Elon Musk went crazy,” or whatever.

Zeyi Yang: Yeah.

Zoë Schiffer: I think the point where we know it's really shifted is when Maye Musk's popularity starts to decline, because you've reported that she's an enormous celebrity in China.

Zeyi Yang: Oh, that would be a big change, for sure. I don't see that happening yet, but maybe soon.

Zoë Schiffer: We're going to take another short break. When we come back, we'll share our recommendations for what to check out on WIRED.com this week.

[break]

Zoë Schiffer: Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. I'm Zoë Schiffer, WIRED's director of business and industry. I'm joined by WIRED senior writer Zeyi Yang. Before we take off, Zeyi, tell our listeners what they absolutely need to read on WIRED.com today.

Zeyi Yang: I will say it's the story about how DOGE is building a massive immigration database, by my colleagues Makena Kelly and Vittoria Elliott. I read the story on Monday morning when I was just coming back from work and my head was blown. I was like, “Oh, wow.” It's connecting so many dots of our previous DOGE reporting, including some by you, Zoë. I remember when I was reading all of those previous stories, I was thinking that, “Why do they want all of this data? What is it going to be of use to them?” Now we're finally connecting dots, like, “Hey, maybe this is what they were going for.” I think that's a much better explainer of the whole DOGE operation to me. The last thing is that, I don't know, there are just so many granular details in that story. Absolutely everyone should read it.

Zoë Schiffer: Yeah, I completely agree. I think one thing we were wondering from the very early days of DOGE, because we saw them sucking up all of this data, or at least accessing it in a lot of different ways. The question was why, like you said. Now we know at least one use might be to track people coming into this country.

Zeyi Yang: I have to say that, as someone from China, this is something people are always afraid of the Chinese government doing. They're saying that, “Well, you obviously have a lot of data of the Chinese people already. Please do not connect them and build it into a central database to surveil everyone.” Now we're seeing a similar kind of thing being built in the US, and that makes me even more scared.

Zoë Schiffer: Yeah, completely. OK. Well, my recommendation is a story that you wrote. You took your Saturday and probably some of your Friday to write about this humanoid robot half-marathon. It was a half-marathon that humans were running in, but also about 21 robots were running in. I think it was the first time we've seen this happen. You wrote this really charming, funny, scary at points dispatch from the race. Maybe because you're here, you can just give us a little bit of an overview, because the robots didn't do that well, right?

Zeyi Yang: No. Unfortunately, no. I was expecting them to do a little bit better, but no. Basically, on Saturday morning in China, this was this half-marathon race in Beijing where 21 robot teams participated. Only six of them actually finished the race, and only one of them made it into the cut of time for human athletes. From that you know they're not doing great. But also, just the literal ways that they fall and fail, it's hilarious. One of them, I remember so clearly. First of all, I don't think it actually worked. It used propellers, like drone propellers to push the robot forward. It immediately lost its direction, twirled in two circles, and fell. And dragged down the human operators too, which was really, really painful. I think it's a good example of saying that robots can do impressive things now, like for example finishing a half-marathon. But at the same time, there are a lot of problems we need to address. Definitely not every company is getting to that level.

Zoë Schiffer: Honestly, it comforts me a little bit that there are some things that they're still worse at than humans, although I'm sure it will change soon. That's our show for today. We'll link to all the stories we spoke about in the show notes. Make sure to check out Thursday's episode of Uncanny Valley, which is about protecting yourself from phone searches at the US border.

At Semafor's 2025 World Economy Summit on Wednesday, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said he believes Netflix's long-term goal to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization is possible if the streaming giant continues to perform well. 

Sarandos said, “In the previous five years, we've doubled our revenue, we grew profits 10 times, and we grew our market cap three times. So there is a path to it, obviously, but it's all incredibly dependent on executing well.”

He seems to confirm a report from The Wall Street Journal earlier this month, in which Netflix executives indicated that the company aims to achieve this goal, as well as double its revenue, by 2030.

Notably, Sarandos mentioned that Netflix could achieve its goals solely through its streaming business. However, the company also intends to explore additional ventures. The Broadway opening of “Stranger Things: The First Shadow” took place in March, and Netflix is set to open retail spaces in Philadelphia and Dallas this year.

Amid rumors that the company is eyeing an IPO, Discord appointed former Activision Blizzard Vice Chairman Humam Sakhnini as CEO. Discord co-founder Jason Citron will leave his CEO role after 13 years at the company.

Discord straddles the gaming and social media spaces — despite its initial emergence as a platform for online multiplayer gamers to communicate, it has become a prominent social media platform in its own right, growing to over 200 million monthly active users.

The company's choice to appoint a new CEO from within the gaming industry signals that it sees its future more so in gaming than in social networking. Discord noted in its press release that the company has “refocused on its gaming roots” to explore monetization opportunities in advertising and micro-transactions.

But advertising and micro-transactions aren't exactly music to gamers' ears. The appointment of Sakhnini, along with its impending IPO, may make fans wary that the company may move in a more corporate, profit-hungry direction. Sakhnini was also CEO of the Activision Blizzard-owned King, a mobile gaming developer that makes games like Candy Crush, which thrive on ads and micro-transactions.

Citron will remain involved with Discord as an advisor to the CEO and a member of the board of directors.

Citron looks forward to taking a break after 13 years of running a rapidly-growing startup. He told Venture Beat that he wants to play Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Blue Prince, and Baldur's Gate III.

WhatsApp announced on Wednesday it's launching a new feature that will allow users to add an extra layer of privacy to chats. The new “Advanced Chat Privacy” setting prevents you and the people you're chatting with from exporting chats and auto-downloading media to their phone.

The setting also prevents users from mentioning Meta AI in messages or asking Meta AI questions.

The idea behind the feature is to give everyone in a group reassurance that no one can take what is being shared and said outside the chat. 

It's worth noting that users can still take individual screenshots. WhatsApp says it plans to add more functionality to Advanced Chat Privacy in the future to include even more protections, so it's possible that the company may prevent screenshots in a future version of the feature. 

The Meta-owned company notes that this feature could be helpful in situations where participants may not know each other well but are discussing sensitive topics. For example, you may be discussing health challenges in a support group or organizing around a meaningful community issue.

You can turn on the new setting by tapping the chat name and selecting the “Advanced Chat Privacy” option. 

The feature is rolling out gradually over the coming months and will be available in both chats and groups. 

While WhatsApp chats are already protected with end-to-end encryption, Advanced Chat Privacy gives users an extra level of privacy. The new setting joins WhatsApp's suite of privacy-focused features, which includes disappearing messages and chat lock.

MIT Technology Review's China reporter shares what she's thinking about lately.

I recently saw Doomers, a new play by Matthew Gasda about the aborted 2023 coup at OpenAI, here represented by a fictional company called MindMesh. The action is set almost entirely in a meeting room; the first act follows executives immediately after the firing of company CEO Seth (a stand-in for Sam Altman), and the second re-creates the board negotiations that determined his fate. It's a solid attempt to capture the zeitgeist of Silicon Valley's AI frenzy and the world's moral panic over artificial intelligence, but the rapid-fire, high-stakes exchanges mean it sometimes seems to get lost in its own verbosity.

The vastness of Chinese cuisine defies easy categorization, and even in a city with no shortage of options, I often find myself cooking—not just to recapture something closer to home, but to create a home unlike one that ever existed. Recently, I've been experimenting with a Chinese take on the charcuterie board—pairing toasted steamed buns, called mantou, with furu, a fermented tofu spread that is sharp, pungent, and full of umami.

I started sewing three years ago, but only in the past year have I begun making clothes from scratch. As a lover of vintage fashion—especially '80s silhouettes—I started out with old patterns I found on Etsy. But recently, I tried something new: copying a beloved dress I bought in a thrift store in Beijing years ago. Doing this is quite literally a process of reverse-engineering—­pinning the garment down, tracing its seams, deconstructing its logic, and rebuilding it. At times my brain feels like an old Mac hitting its CPU limit. But when it works, it feels like a small act of magic. It's an exercise in certainty, the very thing that drew me to fashion in the first place—a chance to inhabit something that feels like an extension of myself.

When I get behind the wheel, I have my little routine I always do. I queue up a playlist or podcast on Spotify, then I plug in the address I'm headed to in Google Maps. It doesn't matter if it's somewhere I've been a million times. I like to just see the traffic and ETA regardless. Offload the mental effort of navigating so I both focus on the road itself while letting my mind wander. Though streaming music and GPS is a great way to kill your phone battery. That's why I right after clicking my phone into its AC mount, I also plug it into a car charger. This Anker USB-C car charger is perfect for the job and right now it's part of a limited time deal—chopping 20% off the price. It can be yours for just $14.

See at Amazon

The Anker car charger is universally compatible. Doesn't matter if you have an iPhone, a Samsung Galaxy, or a Google Pixel. With USB-C, you can connect to any modern smartphone to ensure you don't run out of battery. It has 40W dual ports so you can have two devices plugged in charging at the same time (20W per port). This is great news for whoever is riding shotgun. It's also compatible with just about any vehicle which has a car port.

The charger is super fast. When compared to an original 5W charger, you can charge an iPhone 15 Pro from nothing back up to 25% approximately three times faster. The LED indicator let's you know you device is charging. Additionally, the ports themselves are lit up when the car port in connected so you can easily find them when driving in the dark of night.

Bumpy roads are no match for the Anker car charger. It uses side spring buttons which keep the charger firmly in place to ensure stable charging even when your vehicle is going over rough terrain or hits a pot hole in the road.

Anker's car charger is compact in design. It really just the nub and two ports. Makes it easy to pack with you when traveling. Great to stick in your bag if you're ever out of state, renting a car and unsure what kind of charging you'll have before being handed your keys.

For a limited time, you can secure yourself one of these twin port Anker car chargers for a heft 20% off. It's not that expensive to begin with so you're only saving a few bucks. Though that's not really a complaint. Just an observation of how affordable it was before and how even more affordable it is now. Get one for just $14.

A German startup was aiming to test a reentry capsule designed to reach orbit and survive the intense heat of returning to Earth. For its first flight, PHOENIX 1 launched to space as part of a SpaceX ride-share mission, but a change in launch plans largely messed the whole thing up.

ATMOS Space Cargo launched its PHOENIX 1 capsule at 8:48 p.m. ET on Monday, with the device tucked inside a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. About two hours after liftoff, the capsule reentered Earth's atmosphere, but its splashdown point ended up much farther from the target than originally planned. Missing its intended splashdown zone meant that the spacecraft could not be recovered, and the company could not acquire valuable data and imagery of PHOENIX 1 to see how well it fared during reentry.

The company's inaugural mission was designed to test the capsule's heat shield during reentry. In doing so, ATMOS is hoping to develop a capsule capable of carrying out research in orbit and returning back to Earth with its payloads safe on board.

PHOENIX-1 was part of SpaceX's Bandwagon-3 ride-share mission. The experimental spacecraft was loaded onto the rocket along with two other payloads: a satellite for South Korea's military, and a weather satellite for a Boston-based company. However, not all payloads are created equal. Around five weeks before liftoff, SpaceX informed ATMOS of a change in plans brought on by its primary payload.

Due to operational constraints of the South Korean reconnaissance satellite, PHOENIX 1 found itself on a new flight path. “With a recent update in the overall mission design, our flight path angle and return trajectory has changed, so we went back to the drawing board to quickly adapt,” ATMOS wrote in a statement.

In anticipation of its launch, ATMOS had initially set up ground stations along the spacecraft's path to “ensure continuous data downlink from our heat shield sensors and onboard payloads,” the company stated. PHOENIX 1 was initially supposed to follow a return trajectory designed to pass over those designated ground stations in Africa and Mauritius, before splashing down in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of La Réunion. The new trajectory, however, altered its return trajectory such that the spacecraft initiated its deorbit path over Los Angeles, crossing over Colombia and continuing over Cuiabá in central Brazil. The vehicle then splashed down off the coast of Brazil in the Atlantic Ocean.

The company was forced to set up new ground stations to establish communication with PHOENIX 1, and chartered a plane designed to collect data from the capsule during its reentry. The spacecraft's splashdown ended up being around 310 miles (500 kilometers) farther off the coast, preventing ATMOS from acquiring the data.

ATMOS did receive data from four commercial payloads that were on board the vehicle, and initial indicators suggest that the capsule's heat shield was inflated successfully.

Ride-share missions are designed to carry payloads to space at a lower cost, packing satellites and other spacecraft together on the same rocket. They do come with their own risks, but still provide a chance for space startups to get a go at reaching orbit.

“All in all, I would say it was a very successful mission,” ATMOS Space Cargo CEO Sebastian Klaus during a post-flight press conference.

They've been stockpiling for almost a full year. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


China's top three internet companies reportedly stockpiled billions of dollars worth of Nvidia H20 GPUs before the U.S. export restrictions went into effect in April. Nikkei Asia reports that ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent anticipated the likelihood of an export ban on the China-specific H20 last year, and have since been snapping up as many H20 GPUs as they can get their hands on.The three companies have reportedly accumulated around 1 million H20s — or about a full year's supply. While that is a significant number of GPUs, the companies' full supply was cut short by a month, as they requested that Nvidia ship them their fully-requested volume of H20s by the end of May. If all three companies managed to get their hands on all the H20s they requested, the total value would exceed $12 billion.High demand for computing power is apparently the main reason for the companies' stockpiling: Tencent's integration of DeepSeek into WeChat is a huge contributor to China's demand for computing power.The Nvidia H20 will serve as a stop-gap solution for Chinese companies until homegrown AI GPUs are able to provide similar — or better — performance. Huawei is reportedly working on a new Ascend GPU claimed to rival the performance of Nvidia's GB200, which would give China the same AI computing capabilities as Western countries. Starting in April, the U.S government banned the exportation of Nvidia's H20 HGX AI GPU designed for the Chinese market. The government cited the GPU's memory and interconnect bandwidth, as well as its potential use in supercomputers, as reasons for the ban. The new restriction will force Nvidia to take a massive $5.5 billion financial hit, as it can no longer sell its existing inventory of H20 GPUs to China.The H20 is a cut-down variant of the H100 — Nvidia's predecessor to the current HGX B200. Similar to the RTX 5090D and RTX 4090D, the H20 is a datacenter GPU tailor-made to comply with the U.S government's export sanctions to China, featuring dramatically reduced AI and HPC performance compared to its bigger brother.

Lenovo, HP, and Dell, the world's three largest PC vendors, are reportedly exploring expansion options in Saudi Arabia. According to Digitimes, Saudi Arabia is actively recruiting tech manufacturers with facilities in China to relocate to the Arabian Peninsula as fears of tariff insecurities heighten. The three tech giants are all in different stages of starting production facilities in or near Saudi Arabia's capital city, Riyadh. Lenovo has already declared its plans to build a PC and server assembly factory in Riyadh, and is backed by a $2 billion investment from a subsidiary of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF). HP and Dell have now reportedly sent teams to conduct visits to the country and scout potential construction sites after requests from local governments. Saudi Arabia has also invited several ODMs to move their production facilities to the Arabian Peninsula. Foxconn, Quanta Wistron, Compal, and Inventec are reportedly among the top names being courted, but the ODMs are reticent to move to the Middle East. The ODMs claim that the potential for development in Saudi Arabia hinges on client willingness and outside logistical factors.Saudi Arabia is offering some big promises to potential business partners, and many of these promises are highly attractive to OEMs — but less convincing to ODMs. Beyond the obvious benefit of only being subject to 10% reciprocal tariffs into the U.S. from Saudi Arabia — as opposed to the 245% tariffs currently aimed at China — OEMs are also being courted with the full might of Saudi Arabia's PIF, a $620 billion fund to attract business into the nation. Saudi Arabia has reportedly made assurances, including preferred access to local and African government contracts and start-up perks like fully paid-for factory construction, to Lenovo, HP, and Dell. The potential in-roads into the African market beyond Saudi Arabia were credited as a large part of Lenovo's decision to take its $2 billion Riyadh deal.""Through this powerful strategic collaboration and investment, Lenovo will have significant resources and financial flexibility to further accelerate our transformation and grow our business by capitalizing on the incredible growth momentum in KSA [Kingdom of Saudi Arabia] and the wider MEA [Middle East and Africa] region,"" said Yuanqing Yang, CEO of Lenovo. Lenovo's plant is planned to be fully operational in 2026, at which point Lenovo will begin producing a direct-to-Saudi-Arabia line of products. While this promise of expansion into the greater African and Middle Eastern market is highly attractive to vendors like Lenovo, the ODMs who design their add-in boards are less keen. ODMs require existing supply chain and logistics conditions beyond just labor and production facilities to successfully produce innovative designs — and though Saudi Arabia's goals are high, they do not currently stand out against most ODMs' current operational partners. Vietnam and Thailand are the main production hubs for ODMs such as Foxconn outside of China, thanks to tested supply chain connections. Many ODMs also already have production and R&D facilities in Mexico to take advantage of USMCA free-trade agreements and allow them to skirt U.S. tariffs. ODMs already have proven clients in the OEMs, whereas the OEMs are more likely to be concerned with expanding their market reach. This large-scale courting of the computing industry into Saudi Arabia is part of KSA's ""Vision 2030"" economic plan, which is built on a goal of moving Saudi Arabia's economy beyond fossil fuels and into a more diverse, modern trade giant. Constant tariff flip-flops coming from the U.S. government are certainly helping Saudi Arabia meet this goal, as the world's supply chains are reeling from the newfound instability coming from the world's economic center and are looking for new homes to maintain their security.

The last and final FinFET node from TSMC lives on.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


TSMC started to produce chips on its performance-enhanced N3P (3rd Generation 3nm-class) process technology in the fourth quarter of 2024, as planned, the company revealed at its North American Technology Symposium 2025. N3P succeeds N3E and targets client and data center applications that require enhanced performance while retaining 3nm-class IP. The technology will be succeeded by N3X in the second half of this year.

TSMC's N3P is an optical shrink of N3E that retains design rules and IP compatibility while offering 5% higher performance at the same leakage or 5% – 10% lower power at identical frequencies, along with a 4% transistor density boost for designs with a typical mix of logic, SRAM, and analog blocks. As N3P's density gain comes from improved optics, it enables better scaling across all chip structures, particularly benefiting SRAM-heavy high-performance designs. N3P is now in production — so the company is currently building up products on this technology for its lead customers.

*Chip density published by TSMC reflects 'mixed' chip density consisting of 50% logic, 30% SRAM, and 20% analog.**At the same area. ***At the same speed.But the era of 3nm-class process technologies for high-performance applications does not stop at N3P. The node will be followed by N3X, which promises to increase maximum performance by 5% at the same power or reduce power consumption at the same frequency by 7% when compared to N3P. However, the key benefit of N3X compared to N3P is its support for up to 1.2V voltage (which is extreme for a 3nm-class technology) which will enable the absolute maximum frequency possible (Fmax) for applications that need it (i.e., client CPUs). That Fmax comes with a tradeoff: up to 250% higher leakage power — so chip developers must be careful when building N3X-based designs that feature a 1.2V voltage. Mass production of N3X chips is on track for the second half of this year.

"" N3P started production late last year, in 2024,"" said Kevin Zhang, senior vice president of business development and global sales and deputy COO at TSMC. ""We continue to enhance our 3nm technology. […] Our strategy has been after our introduction of the new nodes, we continue to do enhancement in order to allow our customer to harvest the technology scaling benefit. […] We recognize it is a significant investment for our customers to get [to a new] node, for example, developing IP on the ecosystem. So, we want our customer continue to harvest more benefits from their investment at each new node, but at the same times we are providing them enhancement at a product level.""

TSMC tends to offer multiple iterations of process technologies within one process development kit (e.g., N5, N5P, N4, N4P, N4C). On one hand, this allows the company to use expensive equipment for as long as possible — on the other hand, this also allows its customers to reuse their IP for as long as possible. Therefore, N3P are N3X are natural additions to the N3 family of production nodes.

While the eyes of technology enthusiasts are on TSMC's 2nm-class fabrication processes that rely on gate-all-around (GAA) nanosheet transistors, the vast majority of advanced processors for client applications that will hit the market in the coming quarters (including the next-generation of iPhones, iPads, and Macs) will be made on TSMC's N3 family of process technologies.

 April 23, 2025  

When Matthew Press, MD, was hired to lead Penn Medicine's primary care practices, the first thing he did was create a system to help clinicians treat patients with mental health conditions, particularly those at risk of suicide.

As many as half of Americans who die by suicide have a healthcare visit in the month prior, research has shown. About 10% of these people see a primary care clinician in the week leading up to their attempt.

“I knew how much our primary care clinicians were struggling to help these patients,” said Press, an associate professor of medicine at Penn Medicine and former physician executive of Penn Primary Care in Philadelphia. “Primary care providers have not been equipped with the tools to manage mental health conditions well; they have been sort of alone in the effort and feeling, I think, pretty overwhelmed by that.”

But health systems that embed resources into primary care practices can help patients reduce suicidal thoughts and attempts, according to a new report by the healthcare advocacy organizations Bowman Family Foundation and addiction nonprofit Shatterproof. Known as the collaborative care model, its use in reducing suicide in this setting was first published in a clinical trial in 2002.

Patients are asked questions that might indicate suicidal thoughts or planning during screenings. If the result is positive, primary care clinicians work with a care manager and psychiatrist to provide in-office mental health services, including medication when appropriate. The three programs studied in the report were launched at Kaiser Permanente, the University of Pennsylvania Health System, and Concert Health, a health system in 17 states.

“Most primary care providers are already using depression questionnaires like the [Patient Health Questionnaire-9] PHQ-9. The question is, what am I supposed to do when someone says yes?” said Greg Simon, MD, a psychiatrist and investigator at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, Seattle.

Collaborative care models aimed at preventing suicide were first developed by clinicians at the University of Washington Advancing Integrated Mental Health Solutions (AIMS) Center, Seattle, in the 1990s, which develops research-backed approaches to behavioral healthcare. To date, around 90 clinical trials have tested these models in primary care for additional mental health issues like depression and substance use disorder, showing mostly improved outcomes for patients.

Patients are screened with tools such as the PHQ-9. If a patient is flagged as “at-risk” for suicide, a psychiatry consultant, who may not work on site, provides guidance about what types of care or medication a patient should receive.

After a treatment plan is initiated, a care manager — who might be a nurse, social worker, or physician's assistant — checks in with patients every week to reassess suicide risk, usually with questionnaires or interviews. Patients who need more help might have more medications added or receive a different kind of therapy modality. Care managers help patients arrange those additional appointments.

“Less than 10% of people will show up at a behavioral health visit if you say, ‘Hey here's this number, go make yourself a behavioral health appointment,'” said Brian Ahmedani, PhD, director of the Center for Health Policy & Health Services Research and the Research in Behavioral Health Services at Henry Ford Health in Detroit. “They need help, and collaborative care is exactly that, managing insurance, finding an available appointment at a time that will work for them, and finding the right kind of provider to address those risks.”

The Concert Health and University of Pennsylvania trials enrolled primary care clinicians across 18 states with a little over 4000 patients combined. At Concert Health clinics, roughly 56% of patients in the program reported a reduction in their symptoms, while 49% no longer reported having thoughts of suicide or that they would be better off dead. Patients at the University of Pennsylvania exhibited similar results.

Kaiser Permanente, meanwhile, launched a program that used aspects of the model in 19 primary care practices over a 3-year period starting in 2015. The program used electronic medical records to keep track of patients who were flagged as high risk after screening. During the trial, clinicians at the 19 sites enrolled 228,255 patients. Compared with patients at control clinics, those who received intervention care were 25% less likely to attempt or die by suicide within 90 days of starting the program. The system expanded the model since the trial ended and now uses care managers.

Clinics without these resources can provide parts piecemeal. For instance, if a practice does not provide in-house therapy, just monitoring changes in a patient's mental state can be beneficial, said Teresa Lovins, MD, a family physician in Columbus, Indiana, and a member of the board of directors for the American Academy of Family Physicians.

“You don't necessarily need someone who can do therapy with those patients, as long as they can track those scores,” she said.

A psychiatric consultant might also work with multiple practices, which can be particularly helpful in rural areas where specialists are scarce and in small practices with smaller budgets, Lovins said.

“It's not about doing anything that is impossible; it's about doing small things that are possible and can be effective,” Simon said.

For patients with insurance, clinicians can use billing codes to pay for the model, “as long as you use a screening tool that asks about suicide specifically,” said Ahmedani, who worked on the Kaiser Permanente trial.

For insurers to reimburse, clinics must also provide active treatment and care management and employ a registry to enable review of cases, according to the American Medical Association.

The new report included recommendations on how practices can bill Medicare and private insurance using the add-on code 99494. But for clinicians with large Medicaid caseloads, reimbursement may be a barrier.

“We do still have 15 or so state Medicaid agencies that are not covering the code, and that is an issue if your state isn't covering it,” Press said.

The model can provide support to overstretched primary care clinicians. The goal, Press said, is to take tasks off physicians' already overflowing plate, not to add to it.

“That has been our experience, having that team of experts right there, connected to your practice and in coordination with everything else that is happening with care for that patient, is really a win-win,” he said.

 April 23, 2025  

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given Breakthrough Device Designation to Orchestra BioMed for its atrioventricular interval modulation (AVIM) therapy for patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

AVIM is a pacing algorithm incorporated into dual-chamber pacemakers to treat hypertension. It delivers repeating sequences of shorter and longer atrioventricular delays,lowering blood pressure while simultaneously modulating the autonomic nervous system.

The Breakthrough Device Designation is for an implantable system — a pacemaker — to deliver AVIM therapy in patients with increased 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, preserved left ventricular systolic function, and uncontrolled hypertension, despite the use of anti-hypertensive medications or in patients who may have intolerance to anti-hypertensive medications. Orchestra BioMed estimates that there are more than 7.7 million patients in the US that meet these criteria.

A Pacemaker for Hypertension

""We are delighted to have received FDA Breakthrough Device Designation for AVIM therapy which has the potential to offer a differentiated, advantageous solution for hypertension management in a broad population,"" said David Hochman, CEO of Orchestra BioMed.

A double-blind, randomized pilot study called MODERATO II showed that patients treated with AVIM therapy experienced net reductions of 8.1 mmHg in 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure and 12.3 mmHg in office systolic blood pressure after 6 months compared with control patients.

Another pivotal trial run in collaboration with Medtronic, called BACKBEAT, is currently evaluating the safety and efficacy of AVIM therapy in lowering blood pressure in patients who have been indicated for, and recently implanted with, a dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker.

""Hypertension remains a significant global public health challenge that is especially relevant to the pacemaker population as the most common comorbidity in these patients,"" said Robert C. Kowal, MD, vice president of cardiac pacing therapies within the Medtronic Cardiac Rhythm Management operating unit. ""Medtronic is committed to collaborating with Orchestra BioMed to advance this innovative, investigational therapy through the BACKBEAT global pivotal study.""

But AVIM therapy is designed to have broad clinical applicability beyond patients with hypertension who require a pacemaker. So, there are also plans to extend this approach to patients with uncontrolled hypertension who would not otherwise have a pacemaker.

""There are millions of patients without a pacemaker indication who have uncontrolled hypertension and are at increased cardiovascular risk who we believe may benefit from a device-based treatment like AVIM therapy,"" said Avi Fischer, MD, senior vice president of medical affairs and innovation at Orchestra BioMed. ""It is our long-term vision that AVIM therapy will be used as a potent, always-on, programmable therapy for hypertension that does not rely only on adherence to daily oral medications – one of the greatest challenges in current standard of care – regardless of whether there is an indication for a pacemaker.""

The FDA's Breakthrough Device program is intended to accelerate the development and provide priority review of new medical technologies that have the potential to significantly improve outcomes for patients with serious or life-threatening conditions. It also allows AVIM-enabled devices to qualify for higher reimbursement from the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services in the future.

According to a recent meta-analysis, higher-dose tuberculosis treatment regimens in children, following 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, were associated with significantly higher rates of adverse events than lower-dose treatment regimens.

“Pediatric-specific counselling should be developed and evaluated to minimize severe AEs [adverse events], including advice to discontinue medication and seek care when encountering symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Patient education, a key factor in promoting adherence to TB [tuberculosis] treatment, should also include information about side effects and an action plan if they occur to ensure treatment safety,” authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Michael Prodanuk, Division of Infectious Diseases, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was published online on March 24, 2025, in Clinical Infectious Diseases.

The findings were limited by publication bias in observational trials, as well as substantial heterogeneity between studies, varying definitions of adverse events, and differing monitoring practices between studies. Additionally, the analysis was constrained by the low number of participants living with HIV and the limited reporting of comorbidities such as malnutrition.

This study was supported by the Canadian Paediatric Society's Section on Respiratory Medicine trainee grant and the Edwin S.H. Leong Centre for Healthy Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The authors declared no conflicts of interest.

A drug candidate, previously successful at treating severe fatty liver disease, reduces atherosclerosis - a primary driver of cardiovascular death worldwide - in large mammals, a study suggests.

DT-109 limited the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in both the aorta and coronary arteries of nonhuman primates.

The amino acid compound was developed at University of Michigan.

This glycine-based tripeptide also stopped critical processes that lead to vascular calcification, a significant catalyst of arterial stiffening and plaque instability.

Results of the study, conducted in partnership with Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, are published in Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy.

Atherosclerosis and vascular calcification remain among the leading global health threats, yet current standard-of-care medications fail to effectively address them.

DT-109 has demonstrated a remarkable ability to counteract the progression of atherosclerosis, an achievement that holds immense therapeutic potential.""

Eugene Chen, M.D., Ph.D., co-senior author of the study and Frederick G. L. Huetwell Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School

Chen's team developed DT-109 in 2019 after it was discovered that impaired glycine metabolism can cause non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

In a 2023 study published in Cell Metabolism, the compound reversed fat buildup and prevented scarring in the livers of mice and nonhuman primates that had developed the most severe form of fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

NASH - renamed metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in 2023 - affects nearly 7% of the global population.

The condition is strongly associated with an elevated risk of atherosclerosis, which increases the likelihood of life-threatening events like heart attack and stroke.

""The emergence of DT-109 as a dual-action drug capable of treating both MASH and the vascular complications associated with atherosclerosis marks a significant advancement in the treatment landscape,"" said Jifeng Zhang, Ph.D., co-author and research professor of cardiovascular medicine at U-M Medical School.

""There is significant demand yet limited options for effective drug therapies to treat MASH, which leaves a critical gap in medical treatments that can effectively address both liver dysfunction and its cardiovascular effects.""

During the 2025 study, researchers fed nonhuman primates a cholesterol-rich diet for 10 months before treating them with oral DT-109.

In addition to suppressing the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, DT-109 quelled chronic inflammation that is associated with calcification of the arteries.

This occurred in part by reducing signaling from the NLRP3 ""inflammasome"" protein, which plays a necessary role in vascular calcification.

""These results are of particular importance because they suggest that DT-109 could not only reduce atherosclerotic lesions but also prevent the vascular calcification that exacerbates arterial stiffness and plaque vulnerability in advanced atherosclerosis,"" Chen said.

""This presents an opportunity to address the root of the issue, rather than managing complications as they come up.""

Current standard-of-care for treatment of atherosclerosis primarily involves lipid-lowering drugs, like statins and PCSK9 inhibitors, to manage cholesterol levels.

Those treatments, Chen says, fail to prevent vascular calcification and the progression of atherosclerosis and leave patients at continued risk for cardiovascular events.

The use of nonhuman primate models in these studies, researchers note, present a distinct advantage that could fast track evaluations of DT-109.

Compared to genetically modified mice, the primates exhibit a more accurate representation of human atherosclerosis and metabolic dysfunction.

""Our results in nonhuman primate models strengthens the potential for successful clinical translation, offering hope in a disease landscape currently devoid of effective treatments,"" Chen said.

""Given its ability to reduce liver damage, modulate lipid metabolism and inhibit the inflammatory pathways driving atherosclerosis, DT-109 is positioned as a groundbreaking candidate for clinical trials, with the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce the risks associated with cardiovascular events in those with MASH.""

US women's soccer legend Alex Morgan has shared heartwarming family photos of her newborn son, Enzo, following his birth last month.

Morgan and her husband, fellow soccer player Servando Carrasco, welcomed their daughter, Charlie, in 2020.

And their family recently expanded with the birth of baby boy Enzo, who can be seen with his big sister and parents in adorable new beach photos released by design marketplace Minted.

In one picture, Morgan can be seen holding up Enzo to her nose, while the family can be seen laughing in another as both parents carry their children.

In another sweet shot, Morgan can be seen sitting in the sand as she and her family look at the camera.

Morgan announced the birth of Enzo on March 31, as she and Carrasco jointly posted a picture of his feet to their Instagram accounts.

'Soaking it all up right now. Welcome to the world baby Enzo,' the post was captioned.

Morgan, the fifth-highest scorer in US women's national team history, announced her retirement from professional soccer in September.

Prior to her final game with the San Diego Wave, the striker walked onto the field with daughter Charlie in an emotional scene.

She was also brought flowers by her daughter after the game.

Morgan won two World Cups and one Olympic gold medal with the national team, for whom she appeared 224 times and scored 123 goals.

In a video announcing her retirement, Morgan said she had 'clarity' on the decision.

'It has been a long time coming, and this decision wasn't easy, but at the beginning of 2024, I felt in my heart and soul that this was the last season that I would play soccer,' she said.

'The impact we have on the next generation is irreversible, and I am proud of the hand I had in making that happen, pushing the game forward, and leaving it in a place that I am so happy and proud of.”

The United States Men's National Team faces a crucial test this summer in the Concacaf Gold Cup. It's North America's biennial international tournament that will serve as the USMNT's last competitive preparation for the 2026 World Cup, which will be played in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

The USMNT has a checkered history in the Gold Cup, winning the title seven times (most recently in 2021) but failing to reach the final in 2023 after falling to Panama in the semifinals. (Sound familiar?) 

With the World Cup a little more than a year away (June 11-July 19, 2026), the Gold Cup stands as the biggest and best remaining test of the USMNT's tournament readiness. If it does well, the USMNT will enter the World Cup on a positive trajectory. If the Americans struggle, they will crash into the tournament in a state of chaos.

USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino recently talked with U. S. Soccer about how he's preparing for Gold Cup. Here are the four biggest takeaways from the discussion:

He isn't underestimating his group

The USMNT will face Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia and Haiti in the group stage of the Gold Cup. Only two of those teams will move on to the knockout stage — and while the USMNT is widely expected to be one of them, Pochettino isn't taking anything for granted.

""It's important that we respect all of our opponents in the competition,"" he said. ""The Gold Cup is historically always a difficult competition.""

That's a good mindset to have. Trinidad and Tobago eliminated the USMNT from World Cup contention in 2017, Saudi Arabia beat eventual champion Argentina in the group stage of the 2022 World Cup and Haiti is unbeaten in its last 10 fixtures. They're all capable of delivering upsets and surprises.

He's keeping an eye on character

For Pochettino, competitiveness isn't just about on-field talent. It's also about off-field attitude.

""The mentality of the players is really important,"" he said. ""We need to be intelligent in the way that we are going to select the players and not just choose based on talent alone.""

In practice, that means up-and-coming, high-energy players might get Gold Cup minutes over traditional USMNT starters. Keep an eye on big-hearted characters such as Real Salt Lake's Diego Luna, Olympique Lyonnais' Tanner Tessman and the Vancouver Whitecaps' Brian White. They might play a bigger role in the Gold Cup than previously expected.

He has a grip on the global USMNT playing pool, but his takes on it might be controversial

It has taken time, but Pochettino and his team appear to have a good handle on where the best American soccer players are around the globe, from Milan to Monterrey and everywhere in between. 

""For sure we have a better picture,"" he said of the USMNT landscape. ""Since we took over the project we wanted to identify and scout as many players as possible, both in MLS and those playing abroad.""

Pochettino's recent lineups have taught us plenty about what that picture looks like. He's more positive about Major League Soccer and its players than many predicted he would be, but he's less high on the English Championship and Liga MX than his predecessors. He has passed over Middlesbrough's Aidan Morris, Coventry City's Haji Wright and Club America's Alex Zendejas in recent windows.

He's still high on 'intensity,' but he's not talking much about what it means

If there's one buzzword for the Pochettino era, it's ""intensity""— the Argentine is adamant about cultivating it, protecting it and delivering it since he took over the team last fall. Intensity, unsurprisingly, is back on the menu for the Gold Cup. 

""For sure to start we must compete hard,"" Pochettino said of the tournament. ""We must match the intensity of our opponents, because in these tournaments, they are always motivated to play against the USA.""

But what does Pochettino mean when he says ""intensity""? Is it energy? Physicality? Dedication? Mental fortitude? We've never really found out. 

Pochettino is tight-lipped about how he defines and measures it for his players. But whatever intensity means to Pochettino, the USMNT hasn't provided it yet.

The USMNT will return to action in early June with friendly matches against Turkey and Switzerland. It will open its Gold Cup campaign on June 15 against Trinidad and Tobago in San Jose, California.

Bruce Arena has always been loyal to American players and coaches, and particularly his American players coaches. It is one of the reasons so many of his colleagues would run through a wall for him. Over the past 10 years, it has also been his fundamental flaw.

And in his recent appearance on the ""Unfiltered Soccer"" podcast hosted by two of those former players, Landon Donovan and Tim Howard, Arena showed those colors yet again in his criticism of the hiring of current U.S. men's national team manager Mauricio Pochettino, one that he based on recent results in the Concacaf Nations League semifinals and third-place match.

""You know if you look at every national team in the world, the coach is usually a domestic coach,"" Arena said. ""And I think when you have coaches that don't know our culture, our environment, our players, it's hard. I'm sure our coach is a very good coach, but coaching international football is different than club football, it's a completely different job.

""And I think when you're a national team coach, you need to know your environment, you need to know the animals you coach, and we're lacking that. If you're an American coaching the U.S. team, you know the culture, you know the pride and how important the national team is. I think when you bring in somebody from the outside, they don't understand it, especially in our country, because we're so different.""

There's a lot to unpack here. Even if there is some truth to the idea that hiring a domestic coach makes understanding the culture easier, the last three years of USMNT history have clearly shown the dangers of a national team culture being too insular.

There's also the growing evidence that being an American coach isn't particularly helpful at the MLS level these days, given the recent success of Wilfried Nancy, Ronny Deila, Tata Martino and others at winning the league's top honor.

But all the angles through which to view Arena's comments, the most maddening one is the complete inability to recognize how similar Pochettino's current situation is to the one Arena most recently inherited as a USMNT coach in 2016 and 2017.

Like Pochettino, Arena took over the program in a tough spot at the end of 2016, after the Americans absorbed a home loss to Mexico and an away defeat to Costa Rica in the first two matches of the 10-game Hexagonal to determine Concacaf's three automatic World Cup qualifiers.

At the time, Arena insisted he was more qualified than at any previous moment in his career, given his previous two World Cup cycles of experience and his extended MLS success with D.C. United and then the LA Galaxy.

Less than a year later, it was Arena in charge as the United States lost on home soil -- admittedly in what felt like a road environment -- in a crucial qualifier against Costa Rica on Matchday 7. And it was Arena in charge on that infamous night in Couva on Matchday 10, fielding the exact same XI that had played four days earlier in a qualifying victory.

In that 2-1 defeat to Trinidad and Tobago that killed off U.S. World Cup hopes, the overwhelming response was shock and dismay not just at the score, but at the apparent listless attitude of the American players on the pitch.

It was feedback eerily similar to Arena's assessment of the USMNT's recent Nations League performance last month.

""You ask me if we lacked pride, I'm watching and I'm shocked. I'm shocked that we can't beat Panama and Canada,"" Arena said of those games in Southern California. ""It was shocking to me.

""I don't want to be disrespectful. I want them to do great in the World Cup, there's no question about it. But we only have a year left now. Time is running out, and they got to get going.""

Arena's words carry credibility because he is still almost universally recognized as the best American coach of all time, as the all-time MLS wins leader and the man who guided the Americans to their best modern-era World Cup showing, a 2002 quarterfinal appearance.

Addtionally, that previous success allowed him mostly to escape culpability for the failure to reach Russia in 2018, given a consensus that most of the issues stemmed from residue left by previous manager Jurgen Klinsmann. 

Conventiently, in the present Arena chooses to ignore that the same listlessness on display in Nations League under Pochettino had been seen previously under manager Gregg Berhalter at the 2024 Copa America. Of course, Berhalter was once one of Arena's USMNT players.

And if you look more closely at his USMNT legacy, you might argue he was merely the most fortunate coach in program history.

After a shock 3-2 win over Portugal and 1-1 draw against co-host South Korea, Arena's USMNT entered Matchday 3 requiring only a point against already-eliminated Poland to advance.

Instead, the Americans trailed 2-0 by the fifth minute en route to a 3-1 loss. That opened the door a mile wide for Portugal and South Korea to settle for a bland draw in the other group match that would see both advance.

But Portugal one-upped the USMNT's penchant for self-destruction by getting two men sent off, emboldening South Korea to find a 70th-minute winner through Park Ji-Sung in a 1-0 win that gave the U.S. a backdoor into a round-of-16 clash against Mexico. And the rest is history.

Arena has famously advocated for American players and coaches before, once telling the late Grant Wahl that he didn't agree that the top American players needed to head to Europe to reach their peak. As much as anyone, Arena should know how thin the margins between success and failure are at the international level.

Perhaps deep down he also knows he enjoyed a considerable bit of good fortune to reach his lofty status in the American soccer hierarchy, and is insecure about seeing it challenged.

It's already happening on the club level, where the exploits of Wilfried Nancy with Columbus are causing some to wonder if he will eventually be considered the best MLS head coach of all time. And across MLS, the value of having an American coach is becoming increasingly questionable. Since 2018, four foreign managers have won MLS Cup against three American coaches.

Now the national team has among the most respected managers in the world game at the helm, who is experiencing his first ugly moment in the aftermath of the Concacaf Nations League. And that's exactly when Arena has chosen to pour gasoline on the fire of a program he supposedly cares about.

United States men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino has made it clear that mental fortitude will be a major factor in his player selection for the upcoming Gold Cup, where the team will face Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia, and Haiti in group stage competition.

In an interview released Tuesday by the U.S. Soccer Federation, Pochettino stressed that talent alone would not guarantee players a spot on the roster as he looks to rebuild following disappointing performances in the recent Nations League Finals.

""The right mindset must be there, because we need to compete for our flag, our country,"" Pochettino said. ""We need to be intelligent in the way that we are going to select the players and not just choose based on talent alone. We need to have the right characters to be really competitive.""

The USMNT suffered an unexpected setback in the Nations League last month, falling 1-0 to Panama in the semifinals before losing 2-1 to Canada in the third-place match. These defeats marked the first time the United States failed to win the tournament after claiming victory in its first three editions.

Following those losses, Pochettino publicly criticized his team's competitive spirit and effort levels, concerns he continues to emphasize ahead of the Gold Cup competition.

The former Tottenham and PSG manager has highlighted the need for players to understand their responsibility as national team representatives, particularly when opponents are highly motivated to face the United States.

""For sure to start we must compete hard,"" Pochettino explained. ""We must match the intensity of our opponents, because in these tournaments they are always motivated to play against the USA.""

Pochettino previously drew comparisons to Argentina's mentality in discussions with ESPN, suggesting the world champions' warrior mindset as a model for his American squad: ""They [Argentina] go to war and to defend your badge, your flag, and that is what we need to create.""

Before the Gold Cup tournament begins, the USMNT will return to action with two international friendlies, hosting Turkey on June 7 and Switzerland on June 10, providing Pochettino additional opportunities to evaluate potential squad members.

""It's not just about showing up in your home country and trying to play nice soccer. No, you must be proud, you must fight for the people that would love to be in your position, for the millions of kids that are going to see us and dream to be one day where we are,"" Pochettino emphasized.

""This is the type of responsibility and commitment we need to show in a different way than we did in Los Angeles.""

The Club World Cup will soon be in Atlanta. Tickets are still available.

A combination of ticket prices, event fatigue, unfamiliarity and anticipation are some of the reasons soccer supporters in Atlanta said they aren't overly excited about attending this summer's Club World Cup matches at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

The city is scheduled to host six matches in the tournament, starting with a group-stage match June 16 and finishing with a quarterfinal July 5. Some of the teams that will be here, Chelsea and Manchester City, are among the best in the world.

But potentially getting to watch Erling Haaland or Cole Palmer or Lionel Messi, who should be here with Inter Miami, has a price. Using StubHub on Wednesday, prices for a ticket start at $657, excluding fees and taxes, for a group-stage match and go as high as $11,137 for the quarterfinal. Using Ticketmaster, FIFA's provider, prices for a ticket start at $83.65, excluding fees and taxes, for a group-stage match and go as high as $657.85 for the quarterfinal.

“Don't really care to see any of the teams playing for those prices,” Jordan Comer posted on X. “Also, saving money for the real thing next summer!”

The real thing is the World Cup. Atlanta and Mercedes-Benz Stadium are scheduled to host eight matches in that tournament.



It's a lot of soccer in the city.

In addition to Atlanta United's 17 home matches, the city in the past few years has hosted part of the SheBelieves Cup, the Leagues Cup, friendlies between Premier League teams, with two more on tap this summer, and Copa America matches.

That may be why FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who was in town last week to promote the Club World Cup, reminded people that tickets are still available.

“So much sports, and tournaments ran throughout the year that it feels like overkill,” Juan Alonso, who lives in South Georgia, posted on X. “That excitement and buzz is lost somewhat.”

Some in Atlanta are excited.

“Going to a few games,” Smyrna's Adam Dittmer posted on X. “I think it will be an experience, but it lacks some meaning if you are not a fan of the clubs. Seeing great teams in their home stadiums is also part of the appeal in seeing some teams.”

Not understanding the difference between the Club World Cup and World Cup is a hurdle for casual sports fans.

The Club World Cup is a tournament for teams that play in leagues, such as Manchester City in the Premier League. The tournament was first held in 2000. Teams that win each FIFA region's Champions League, or place high, are among those that qualify. The prize money has increased from $28 million distributed to eight teams when it started to $1 billion distributed to 32 teams this summer. Real Madrid has the most championships (5).

The World Cup is for national teams, such as the United States, Brazil or Argentina. Some of the players who will compete for their clubs in this summer's Club World Cup will compete for their national teams in next summer's World Cup. Next year's host nations are the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

Regardless of how some Atlantans feel about the Club World Cup, there still will be thousands of people attending the matches in the city because the teams have passionate supporters. FIFA, which declined to provide ticket sales totals, said people from more than 130 countries have purchased tickets for tournament matches.

Former Atlanta United Vice President Carlos Bocanegra, speaking Wednesday in interviews set up by FIFA and focused on the Club World Cup, said the soccer that people could see at this summer's tournament may be better than what they may see in next summer's World Cup.

Bocanegra, who played for the U.S. more than 100 times, said one of the benefits of the Club World Cup is that players already know one another. Unlike when playing for a national team, when players have just a few days to learn each other and work on what the manager wants, the club teams have been playing together and working with the manager for months to years.

“The football could be a little bit more fluid,” he said.

Bocanegra also discussed the spectacle of the supporters at the games may add to the enjoyment.

“If people don't know about the Flamengoes of the world or Palmeiras or Boca Juniors or River Plate, they're really going to see how big of a following that those teams have when they show up to the stadium and watch these teams play,” he said. “They are iconic teams and have massive following, not only in their home country, but here in the United States because we have so many expats from all over the world. So I do think that's going to be a pretty cool experience, and just a big party for these people to enjoy watching their teams play and competing against the best of the best.”

Former Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger on Wednesday said that those who do watch the Club World Cup may get a chance to see not only the bona fide stars such as Real Madrid's Vinicius, but also players who are unknowns now but can become world-class.

“Hope I will have surprises from Africa, from Asia, from Oceania, from South America, and that we discover some players, and this tournament could help us to discover some new players,” he said. “It's a unique opportunity for players who don't go to the World Cup because we have about 87 or 90 different countries who will be represented by players who do not go to the World Cup and can win the (Club) World Cup.”

The Club World Cup will be televised live on Channel 5 this summer after the free-to-air broadcaster reached a sublicensing agreement for the UK with the global rights holder, Dazn.

The Guardian can reveal that as part of a cross-promotional deal finalised this week, 23 of the 63 matches will be shown on Channel 5 as well as on Dazn – 15 group games, four last-16 ties, two quarter-finals, one semi-final and the final. The remaining 40 games will be shown exclusively by Dazn, which has committed to making every match in the new expanded tournament available free-to-air globally via its app.

The Club World Cup, which includes Chelsea and Manchester City, will be the highest-profile sports event televised by Channel 5, which has held live rights to the Europa League and numerous highlights packages. Channel 5 is also in talks with the England and Wales Cricket Board about buying two men's and two women's England T20 matches this summer as it seeks to expand its sports coverage. It is owned by the American film giant Paramount.

Dazn paid $1bn (£787m) for global Club World Cup rights in February in a surprise deal that appears to have been largely funded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, with the kingdom's Surj Sports Investment group last month confirming it had taken a minority stake in the streaming company valued at $1bn. Fifa subsequently announced the prize and appearance fund would also be $1bn, with the tournament winners to receive up to $125.8m depending on their results and Chelsea and City to bank $38.19m for qualifying.

The Dazn/Surj partnership spared Fifa's blushes after a lengthy TV rights sales process which had concluded with it failing to find rights partners. Apple TV withdrew from advanced negotiations over a global deal last summer after a disagreement over valuation, with Fifa reportedly demanding $4bn, and a subsequent attempt to sell the rights on a regional basis foundered.

Although Dazn's latest accounts say it has 300 million monthly users globally, it remains a challenger company in certain markets, including the UK, which led to an agreement to sublicense the rights to ensure larger viewing figures for Fifa and its commercial partners. Warner Bros has a sublicensing deal in the United States.

The Guardian reported this month that the BBC and ITV had opted not to bid because their main football focus will be their joint coverage of England's defence of the Women's European Championship. Channel 5 beat Channel 4 to an agreement with Dazn, the deal brokered by Lee Sears, Paramount's president of international ad sales.

“We're delighted to be able to have agreed this fantastic partnership with Dazn to expand free-to-air coverage of the Fifa Club World Cup, live on 5,” Sears told the Guardian. “It's going to be one of the sporting events of the summer with most of the matches played in the evening peak time and 32 of the world's biggest clubs involved.” Sears said the ambition was to offer viewers and advertisers “even more [sport] in the months to come”.

As hundreds of thousands of soccer fans from around the world flock to Atlanta for the World Cup next summer, State Farm Arena wants in on the action. 

The arena is launching a concert series it calls Summer Kickoff ATL, which will run between June and July of next year, according to a Wednesday press release. A lineup and specific dates have yet to be determined, though artists have already expressed interest in being a part of the event, said Andrew Saltzman, State Farm Arena's president of business enterprise and chief commercial officer.

“When you look back and think about what the summer of 2026 did for the city of Atlanta, we want State Farm Arena to be seen as an epicenter of entertainment,” Saltzman said in an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Atlanta is one of 16 cities across the U.S., Mexico and Canada slated to host matches for the 2026 World Cup. Eight matches will be held at Mercedes-Benz Stadium between June 11 and July 19.

Next to the Centennial Olympic Games in 1996, hosting the eight World Cup matches is said to be the second-most important sporting event in Atlanta's history. The matches are projected to have an economic impact of $503.2 million from just out-of-state visitors, according to a study produced by Jerry D. Parrish for the Metro Atlanta Chamber, who described the projections as conservative. Each match will be like hosting a Super Bowl. The study estimates the matches will attract about 520,000 spectators in total, about 225,000 of which will come from out of state.

State Farm Arena has a history of hosting concerts ahead of major sporting events. Earlier this year, the arena hosted a two-day concert series dubbed AT&T Playoff Playlist Live as part of College Football Playoff National Championship weekend. Gucci Mane, Lil Wayne and Quavo were among the performers. In 2019, ahead of Super Bowl LIII, the venue held a three-day festival with Bruno Mars, Ludacris and Aerosmith as headliners. The series of shows earned more than $10 million in revenue and resulted in more than 38,000 tickets sold, according to venue sources from the time.



The arena is adjacent to Mercedes-Benz Stadium and other major developments under construction in downtown, such as Centennial Yards and South Downtown. This presents opportunities, Saltzman said.

“The learnings are: this works and makes sense. That's why we're investing in this opportunity and will continue to as mega events come in,” Saltzman said.

Now, it's a matter of finding the right entertainment options that appeal to a broad amount of people, Saltzman said. The countries represented in the eight matches won't be determined until September.

“What we've realized is when guests are coming to town, it's critical that they're entertained,” Saltzman said. “Music is that common thread.”

The clay court season is well underway with the ATP Madrid Masters 1000 tournament rolling into Day 2. There are a lot of matches scheduled for Thursday and it promises to be an exciting day of tennis. As ever, we at LWOT preview and predict the matches scheduled for you.

Head-to-head – First Meeting

Both players enter this tournament with little confidence on the clay courts as neither managed to win consecutive matches on the trot this year on clay. Marcos Giron is higher ranked and he would feel good about his chances against Learner Tien who will find it tough to hit through on the slow courts in Madrid. Expect Giron to be more aggressive and get the win.
Prediction: Giron in 3

Head-to-head – First Meeting

It will be interesting to see how well Tallon Griekspoor plays this week as he has built good momentum on the clay courts this year. He now faces Vit Kopriva who hasn't played much on the main tour and will find it tough to go toe to toe with the quality of Griekspoor.
Prediction: Griekspoor in 2

Head-to-head – First Meeting

Tomas Martin Etcheverry hasn't had the European clay court swing he would have liked so far and his first round this week is a tricky one. He takes on Hamad Medjedovic who has had good results in the past month or so and the young Serb will look to capitalise on that. Expect a tight match with the Serb winning with his assured attacking game style.
Prediction: Medjedovic in 3

Head-to-head – Struff 1-1 Zandschulp

Jan-Lennard Struff has had a disastrous 2025 season so far and the clay court season hasn't been kind to him either. The German now faces Botic van de Zandschulp, who is building up some momentum having reached the Round of 16 in Munich last week. The Dutchman will look to take full toll of Struff's lack of confidence and the clay courts will enable Zandschulp to do so.
Prediction: van de Zandschulp in 3

16 first round matches are scheduled on Day 2 of the ATP Mutua Madrid Open. Lots of exciting matches to look forward to for the fans including the match between Nicolas Jarry and Daniel Altmaier. As always, we at LWOT will offer predictions for every match on the slate, but who will advance?

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Mattia Bellucci is sitting at his career-high ranking and any match wins this week will only improve his rankings. He is playing in Madrid for the first time and will like his chances to make a winning start. Damir Dzumhur is an experienced campaigner and has been in good form recently. Dzumhur made the semifinals in Bucharest and then did well to qualify for the main draw of Barcelona Open. Both players are extremely close in rankings and I expect a tight contest.
Prediction: Dzumhur in 3

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Quentin Halys will play his first match on clay this season and has to go through a tough first-round match. Halys is not known for his game on clay but the quicker conditions in Madrid should help his big serve. However, I still like Luciano Darderi's chances better in this match as he is the more natural on this surface and has played some fantastic tennis in the last month. If the Italian player can get into enough rallies, he will be the favourite to win.
Prediction: Darderi in 3

Head-to-Head:

Zizou Bergs is enjoying the best season of his career and has been super consistent. He has only played 19 main draw matches on clay but his game style is well suited for the surface. Yoshihito Nishioka will play his first match on ckay this season and would be the heavy underdog going into this match. The Japanese prefers to play on hard courts and Bergs should be able to trouble him with heavy top spin. Nishioka's serve will also be under pressure all match. All in all, I like Bergs to win this match comfortably.
Prediction: Bergs in 2

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Nicolas Jarry has the perfect game to exploit the conditions of the Madrid Masters, but surprisingly he has only one win here in two main draw appearances. Jarry is going through a rough patch since the French Open last year and is on a five match losing streak. However, he has shown some glimpses of better tennis recently and will look to play a solid match. Daniel Altmaier has a good record here and is a former quarterfinalist. Altmaier has done a lot of winning this year including the two wins in qualifying. If Jarry plays at his best he can win this but his form can't be trusted.
Prediction: Altmaier in 3

Teenage sensation Joao Fonseca has taken the tennis world by storm this season. The Brazilian took out a top-10 seed on his Grand Slam debut and followed it up by winning his first title in Buenos Aires. Now, he's eyeing a showdown with Novak Djokovic.

The world No. 65 has already put himself on Djokovic's radar. The 24-time Grand Slam champion has lauded praise on Fonseca and his rise. But, while other up-and-comers would rather avoid Djokovic at the biggest tournaments, Fonseca is all-in on a blockbuster first-round meeting at the French Open.

Fonseca enjoys a challenge. The 18-year-old qualified for his first Grand Slam main draw at the Australian Open back in January and stunned No. 9 seed Andrey Rublev in straight sets.

A few weeks later, Fonseca claimed his first ATP Tour title at the Argentina Open, and he's also collected two Challenger trophies this season.

The Brazilian hit a career-high ranking of No. 59 earlier this year and now sits at No. 65, meaning he can claim direct entry into the Grand Slam tournaments, including next month's French Open.

Fonseca is hoping for another huge test in his next Major appearance, facing Djokovic. The teenager grew up watching the Serb dominate the sport, and he now enters every tournament hoping they will meet in the first round.

“When we start these biggest tournaments, the Grand Slams, the qualies, I always tell my coach, ‘If I go to the main draw, I want to play Djokovic', because it's probably one of the last times. I hope I can play him,” he told Roland Garros.

“I'd love to face Djokovic first, second round. I'd try to play my best tennis, the result wouldn't matter, I'd just enjoy it.”

Djokovic has 24 Major trophies under his belt, three of which came at the French Open, and plenty of players wouldn't want to face him early in one of the biggest tournaments. But Fonseca thrives against top opponents.

He added: “I like to play the top seeds, I like the challenge. I play with no pressure, so I think I can play well there.

“I like to play with the crowd also, so it's an experience I want to have. Some players will want to play ‘easier' first, but I want to play the iconic ones.”

Djokovic would also likely relish a chance to play the 18-year-old while their paths can still cross. During last month's Miami Open, the tennis legend admitted he'd been impressed with Fonseca.

“He's been [the] talk of the tour in the last several months. I mean, deservedly so,” Djokovic said.

“He's a very good tennis player. I mean, so young. Just incredible firepower from both ends of the baseline, serve. He's a very complete player.”

Before he can think about the French Open, Fonseca is currently getting some reps in on the clay at the Madrid Open. He faces another young star, qualifier Elmer Moller, in the first round on Thursday.

Carlos Alcaraz and Barbora Krejcikova won the men's and women's singles titles at Wimbledon last year

Last year's Wimbledon Championships delivered a ""record surplus"" of nearly £50m for British tennis.

The Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) received £49.853m last year, under an agreement which allows The All England Club (AELTC) to pass on 90% of its profits to the governing body each year.

""Despite a wet championships, the company delivered a record surplus for the LTA,"" the annual report says.

The AELTC's financial statement for the year to July 2024 also reveals slightly increased profits of £54.332m, and turnover which rose to £406.507m.

Prize money has doubled in the past 10 years, but players have long been agitating for a greater share of the revenue generated by the four Grand Slams.

Last month, the top 20 men's and women's players sent a letter asking for more prize money to the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open.

In a new Netflix documentary, ""Carlos Alcaraz: My Way"", the Spaniard describes how he went against the advice of his team to let his hair down on the Mediterranean island.

""I had a friend who had a few days off, going to Ibiza with other friends,"" the now four-time Grand Slam champion said.

""I ended up going and they know what I'm going there to do. In Ibiza, I'm not going to lie, it's pretty much all about partying and going out.

""I basically went there to reventar (literally, 'burst' in Spanish), I'm not sure if that's the best way to put it but I went there to go out.""

It might not have been textbook preparation for Wimbledon, and his agent Albert Molina warned against it, but Alcaraz said he had to let off steam after losing to Novak Djokovic in the 2023 French Open semis having suffered with nerves and cramps.

Ibiza's tonic paid off spectacularly too, as a few weeks later, aged 20, he beat the Serb in the Wimbledon final.

""I tried to explain to him that it might not be the best idea to go to Ibiza for three or four days on vacation when he had Queen's the following week and then Wimbledon,"" Molina said.

Alcaraz repeated the trick in 2024 with another Ibiza trip before the grass-court season with his fitness coach Juanjo Moreno accusing him of being selfish.

In the documentary his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero even questions whether Alcaraz has the dedication required to emulate the likes of Djokovic and Rafael Nadal.

""He has a different way of understanding work and sacrifice,"" Ferrero said, comparing him to Djokovic. ""It's so different that it makes me question whether he can really be the best in history.""

But Alcaraz has no regrets.

""They always want to protect me, but I'm getting older, I'm starting to make my own decisions and that's what I want,"" he said. ""I don't take care of myself as much, I spend a lot of days enjoying life. Maybe more than I should.

""But I want to do it my way.""

Alcaraz, who will be 22 next month, is second seed at this week's Madrid Masters.","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","tennis"

What to know","https://www.naplesnews.com/story/sports/2025/04/23/andre-agassi-playing-us-open-pickleball-championships-naples-anna-leigh-waters/83227959007/","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:27:40 GMT","

Tennis legend Andre Agassi will make his pro pickleball debut at the US Open Championships in Naples. The tournament is set to run from April 26-May 3 at East Naples Community Park.

Agassi, a former world No. 1-ranked tennis player and winner of the sport's Grand Slam, will partner with Anna Leigh Waters, the top-ranked women's player in singles, doubles and mixed doubles.

Here is more to know about Andre Agassi, one of the most iconic tennis players in the sport's history.

Agassi was born on April 29, 1970 in Las Vegas, which means he is 54 years old. His father Mike Agassi, an Iranian immigrant, was determined his son would be a successful tennis player.

When he was 13, Agassi started training at Nick Bollettieri's tennis academy in Bradenton. He made his professional debut as a 16-year-old in 1986 and won his first major in 1992 when he defeated Groan Ivanisevic at Wimbledon.

Agassi has been married to former women's tennis great Steffi Graf since 2001. The tennis power couple first met following Agassi's Wimbledon victory in 1992. They have two children: Jaden Gil Agassi, age 23, and Jaz Elle Agassi, 21.

Agassi was previously married to actress Brooke Shields from 1995 to 1997.

The 18-year-old Waters, Agassi's playing partner at the US Open Pickleball Championships in Naples, turned pro as a 12-year-old in 2019, becoming the youngest pickleball champion in the sport's history.

Waters, who lives in Boynton Beach, has since won 148 gold medals and earned an estimated $3 million per year from endorsements and sponsorships in 2024, according to Forbes, making her the highest-paid pickleball player in the world.","{'href': 'https://www.naplesnews.com', 'title': 'Naples Daily News'}","tennis"

Former tennis world No 1 Andre Agassi will make his professional debut in the fast-growing sport of pickelball next week when he teams up with top ranked Anna Leigh Waters for the mixed doubles at the US Open Pickleball Championships.

Invented in 1965 by a group of American friends, pickleball is a fast-paced paddle sport similar to tennis and badminton played on smaller courts using a perforated plastic ball, and interest has skyrocketed in recent years.

Waters, 18, is the Professional Pickleball Association's top-ranked player in the world for singles, doubles and mixed doubles and Agassi said he would probably weigh her down.

“She's probably sick of winning so much, and that's why she called me and asked me to play,” Agassi, who won eight tennis grand slams among his 60 ATP Tour-level titles, told CNBC on Tuesday.

The 54-year-old added that he did not see him joining the growing ranks of pro pickeball players after the tournament, which takes place in Naples, Florida.

“If I had the luxury of bandwidth to focus all my energy on just playing and body recovery and all that stuff, that would be a joy. But I don't. I'm in a different season now,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"

It has been a year of firsts for Learner Tien. In January, the 19-year-old earned his first win at a Grand Slam, becoming the youngest man since Rafael Nadal in 2005 to reach the fourth round of the Australian Open. Along the way, he claimed his maiden Top 10 victory, upsetting Daniil Medvedev.

Tien followed that with his first ATP 500 quarter-final appearance in Acapulco, where he notched another impressive win over Alexander Zverev. Now, he arrives at the Mutua Madrid Open looking to build on that momentum during his debut European clay swing.

“It's a lot to take in, playing all these new events,” Tien told ATPTour.com on Media Day in Madrid. “I'm playing in places I've never been, in countries I've never visited. But I'm trying to enjoy it all. It's my first real go at the full Tour, so I'm just soaking it all in. It is cool to share the locker room with the top players, something I am getting used to. I am just excited to play these events.

“There are times when having no language barrier back home in the US makes things easier, but it's also great to experience new places and cultures. I'm enjoying that.”






The 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF runner-up had never visited Europe prior to his arrival in Munich last week, when he advanced through qualifying before losing to Tallon Griekspoor in the first round at the ATP 500.
Now in Madrid, Tien is set to compete in just his third tour-level match on clay. The lefty is excited to build his experience on the surface but is not setting expectations high.
“It's definitely different the clay, very different from what I've played on before. I have had a hit here and I will adjust to it but I don't have a lot of experience on clay in general and the clay in the United States is not the same as here,” Tien said. “But I think it's a great learning opportunity. If not now, then in the next couple of years, I'm sure the experience will help me a lot. That is what I will try and take from these next weeks.”

Tien was a consistent winner on the ATP Challenger Tour last season, lifting three trophies at the level. He finished 2024 by advancing to the title match at the 20-and-under event in Jeddah and then grabbed headlines with his Australian Open run.
Tien's success has resulted in him packing out stadiums and last month's match against Joao Fonseca in Miami was a clear example of that. The crowd inside Hard Rock Stadium created a carnival atmosphere, an experience Tien is grateful to have had.
“I knew going into it that one with Joao there would be a lot of Brazilian fans, and that's totally deserved, he always draws a big crowd. But I think it's fun,” Tien said. “It adds drama and suspense to the match, which I enjoy.
""Once I step on court, I don't think about it too much. But afterward, I can reflect and be like, ‘Yeah, that was pretty cool, having all those fans watch'. When the whole arena is locked in from the first point, it just makes the match more exciting. I have noticed there are way more people at my matches now and I love that.”
Tien, No. 69 in the PIF ATP Rankings, will hope to put on a show for the Madrid crowd on Thursday when he takes on Marcos Giron in the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. If he advances, he will face Italian Matteo Berrettini in the second round.

Tien was a consistent winner on the ATP Challenger Tour last season, lifting three trophies at the level. He finished 2024 by advancing to the title match at the 20-and-under event in Jeddah and then grabbed headlines with his Australian Open run.

Tien's success has resulted in him packing out stadiums and last month's match against Joao Fonseca in Miami was a clear example of that. The crowd inside Hard Rock Stadium created a carnival atmosphere, an experience Tien is grateful to have had.

“I knew going into it that one with Joao there would be a lot of Brazilian fans, and that's totally deserved, he always draws a big crowd. But I think it's fun,” Tien said. “It adds drama and suspense to the match, which I enjoy.

""Once I step on court, I don't think about it too much. But afterward, I can reflect and be like, ‘Yeah, that was pretty cool, having all those fans watch'. When the whole arena is locked in from the first point, it just makes the match more exciting. I have noticed there are way more people at my matches now and I love that.”

Tien, No. 69 in the PIF ATP Rankings, will hope to put on a show for the Madrid crowd on Thursday when he takes on Marcos Giron in the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. If he advances, he will face Italian Matteo Berrettini in the second round.

Taylor Fritz arrives at the Mutua Madrid Open hoping to put his injury troubles behind him. The American has struggled with an abdominal injury since the start of February and has been unable to compete to his full capacity.

“It has been really frustrating,” Fritz told ATP Media on Media Day in Madrid. “I think this year is the least amount of tennis I have ever played. I haven't been playing in between tournaments because I have been trying to give it time to heal.

“I mismanaged it at the beginning. It wasn't bad enough at the beginning to stop so I played. It happened before Dallas so I played Dallas, Delray and went to Acapulco and I probably should not have played any of those tournaments. I could play but I knew I [was] not going to be able to play well enough to win.”



Fritz took three weeks off after his quarter-final exit in Delray Beach and arrived in Indian Wells in better shape. The 27-year-old lost in the fourth round to champion Jack Draper and then soared to the quarter-finals in Miami before the abdominal injury flared up again.

“I took some time off [after Delray] and felt decent in Indian Wells and felt good in Miami,"" Fritz said. ""I was really happy in Miami because the first time since Australian Open I was able to play with no pain, all out, not having to think about it.

“In the quarter-finals I re-injured it and before I went to Monte-Carlo I got a scan to see how it is and it showed I had a small tear. I took three more weeks, I wanted to give it a bit more time. It is feeling so far better. I have only played a couple days since coming back, so managing it. I just want to be done with it. It has been one of the most frustrating injuries I have ever dealt with because it has been so hard to get to go away.”

Forced to miss Monte-Carlo, Fritz is set to compete on clay for the first time this year when he takes to court in Madrid. The American ended 2024 at No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings, having reached the title match at the Nitto ATP Finals. Fritz is frustrated with the loss of momentum caused by his injury setback.

“It is very limiting of certain shots, so I try and not play certain shots. It has been impacting my game a lot,” Fritz said. I just want to be in a place where I can play like I normally play and not have to think about it.

Determined to rebuild lost momentum, third seed Fritz will play Christopher O'Connell in his opening match in Madrid. Fritz has fond memories in the Spanish capital, having advanced to the semi-finals at the ATP Masters 1000 clay-court event last year.

Tony Gilroy on why that sexual assault attempt against an ""undocumented"" fugitive in the show's season two premiere block was necessary to tell an accurate tale of revolution — even within the Star Wars universe. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


[This story contains spoilers from the first three episodes of Andor season two.]


	Disney+'s acclaimed Andor has stretched the creative boundaries of Star Wars in countless ways, bringing a grown-up sensibility to a galaxy far, far away.




	Yet even by Andor standards, a scene from the second season is leaving fans shocked: An Imperial officer tries to violently rape a Rebel fugitive, Bix Caleen (Adria Arjona), who is hiding out in a farming settlement while Imperial troops are rounding up “undocumented” citizens (read some sample reactions below).

					'Andor' Season 2 Premiere Scene Has a Real-Life Nazi Inspiration		
			









	The sequence plays out over the course of the show's third episode (the first three episodes were released all at once on Tuesday) with the officer's flirtation with Bix turning growing increasingly persistent and eventually cumulating with a brutal life-and-death struggle. Bix eventually gets the upper hand and the officer is killed. But Andor boldly leaves zero ambiguity as to what viewers just witnessed as Bix screams, “He tried to rape me!”


Star Wars is a franchise that has never — in film form — shown even consensual sex. During its first season, Andor pushed the envelope with scenes that suggested sex was about to take place, or just had (much like old Hollywood films during the Hays Code censorship era).


	When asked about the Bix scene, Andor creator Tony Gilroy explained to The Hollywood Reporter that when telling a story about a war, shying away from sexual assault didn't feel truthful.


	“I get one shot to tell everything I know — or can discover, or that I've learned — about revolution, about battles, with as many incidents and as many colors as I can get in there, without having [the story] tip over,” says Gilroy. “I mean, let's be honest, man: The history of civilization, there's a huge arterial component of it that's rape. All of us who are here — we are all the product of rape. I mean armies and power throughout history [have committed rape]. So to not touch on it, in some way … It just was organic and it felt right, coming about as a power trip for this guy. I was really trying to make a path for Bix that would ultimately lead to clarity — but a difficult path to get back to clarity.”


	Asked about Disney's reaction to the scene, Gilroy says he didn't get any studio pushback.

	











	“No one ever ever said anything about it, ever,” Gilroy said. “But I mean, we have limits on what we can do. We are very aware of what we can do sexually and violence wise. Those limits are made very clear.”


	Bix has had a particularly brutal journey on the show so far, having already been captured and tortured by the Imperial Security Bureau during season one, an experience which has left her traumatized.


	Fan reactions have been divided. One major Star Wars fan account wrote, “I don't want to see rape in Star Wars … You can portray power dynamics and making the audience hate the empire in other ways without taking it to such a disgusting place. Vader wouldn't tolerate that shit nor does the Empire condone it. It has no place in Star Wars. Period.” Another pop culture fan account wrote, “I don't mind having mature Star Wars but I'm not ok with it going so far as depicting an attempted rape. Or saying the word ‘rape.' I'm actually quite disgusted with the Andor series right now.”


	While another fan account was one of many that praised the move: “Andor dared to go to the darkest places Star Wars could offer. An Imperial Officer abusing his untouchable status to rape an undocumented migrant, while his troops are rounding up other undocumented citizens. This is the real world seeping into Star Wars storytelling; this is the world WE live in, reflected in the galaxy far, far away, this is Star Wars at its most political, its most potent, its most frightening. I must commend the writing team's bravery to not shy away from such topics. To depict fascist regimes as they are, speak the word ‘rape' directly into the camera, show just how despicable fascists really are. Andor is as brilliant as it is terrifying.”

	











	And yet another fan account pointed out several previous suggestions of sexual servitude in Star Wars — often with scantily clad female characters (Princess Leia on a leash in her famous slave slave bikini in Return of the Jedi being a key example). “Seen some discourse already regarding what happens with Bix in Andor , that kind of thing has happened in Star Wars before except this time they called it what it was,” they wrote. “Adria Arjona played it brilliantly and it was heartbreaking.”


	The episode also featured a rather stunning sequence with Mon Mothma (Genevieve O'Reilly) furiously dancing at her daughter's wedding, even as she knew a man was about to be murdered to protect her secret ties to the Rebel Alliance. The sequence was full of frantic energy and showed a rather different side to the stately senator. 


	“It's my contention that Mon has the hardest road of any character in the whole show,” Gilroy says. “Other people suffer all kinds of sacrifices and all the physical threats. She has to do everything under glass, being examined all the time. She's continually watched. I really wanted to up the stakes there. She's tacitly involved in what will be an assassination and then has go back into the party, which is this joyous event for everybody else, in that kind of chaotic mental state and with that kind of guilt. She's dancing instead of screaming. And what's fascinating there is that there's nobody else in that room except you — the audience — who understands what's happening to her.”

	











	Gilroy also discussed with The Hollywood Reporter another key scene from the first episode, which has a real-life Nazi inspiration. 


Andor is Disney+'s acclaimed Star Wars drama series which currently has the highest rating of any Star Wars TV show or movie on Rotten Tomatoes. The show follows the adventures of Rebel Alliance leader Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and leads up to the events in the film Rogue One. The 12-episode second season will be released in three episode blocks over the next four weeks.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


Sweet Magnolia fans' patience has been rewarded — Netflix has renewed the small town romantic drama for a fifth season with Sheryl J. Anderson back as showrunner. The news comes more than two and a half months after the release of Season 4.  


	Unlike previous renewals, the latest pickup was likely not as straightforward since the series, typically a reliable audience draw, spent only two weeks in Netflix's global Top 10 for English-language series with its fourth season, peaking at #4. There have been shows with similar performance that have been canceled by the streamer.

	Billed by Netflix as “comfort drama,” Sweet Magnolias, based on the book series by Sherryl Woods, follows lifelong best friends Maddie (JoAnna Garcia Swisher), Dana Sue (Brooke Elliott), and Helen (Heather Headley) as they juggle relationships, family, and careers in the charming small town of Serenity, SC.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Season 5, which is not labeled final by Netflix in the renewal announcement, will pick up after an eventful Season 4 finale, which ended on multiple cliffhangers, the biggest being Maddie's pending move to New York for a publishing job. 


	“Can anything end the Magnolias?! Our ladies have seen each other through bigger challenges than physical distance,” Anderson told Deadline in an interview after the release of Season 4. “When you love someone, you want what's best for them and want to help them reach that goal. True friends celebrate each other in times of victory, embolden each other to seize their passion, and then link arms to figure out logistics.”


	Anderson executive produces with Dan Paulson, whose Daniel L. Paulson Productions is producing the series. Matt Drake will serve as an executive producer. Norman Buckley serves as co-executive producer.

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


	20th Century Studios has dropped the first trailer for Predator: Badlands, the next anticipated live-action installment in the Predator franchise, which will be released in theaters and on IMAX November 7.


	The twist to this one? Man and extraterrestrial are on the same side. Starring Elle Fanning and Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi, the film is set in the future on a remote planet, where a young Predator (Schuster-Koloamatangi), outcast from his clan, finds an unlikely ally in Thia (Fanning) and embarks on a treacherous journey in search of the ultimate adversary.


	Dan Trachtenberg, the filmmaker behind 20th/Hulu smash Prey, directed the film, from his script written with Patrick Aison. He also produced alongside John Davis, Marc Toberoff, Ben Rosenblatt, and Brent O'Connor.Trachtenberg brought new life to Predator with Prey, a film unlike any other in the franchise, which centered on a young Comanche warrior's (Amber Midthunder) clash with Predators during the 1700s. In addition to setting viewership records for Hulu, it garnered six Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Television Movie. Upon his success there, Trachtenberg has seemingly been given the reins to the franchise, directing not only Badlands, but the animated Killer of Killers, premiering on Hulu June 6, as well.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


Netflix has ordered The Age Of Innocence, a limited series based on Edith Wharton's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. Emma Frost (The White Queen, The White Princess) has penned the adaptation and will serve as executive producer and showrunner on the Chernin Entertainment production.


	The series was quietly greenlighted earlier this year and has been prepping for a fall start of production in Europe for a couple of months now. Netflix would not confirm the pickup to Deadline, instead opting to announce it on World Book Day. 


	A fresh take on Edith Wharton's classic novel of forbidden love in 19th century New York, The Age Of Innocence is a will-they/won't-they love triangle exploring themes of freedom, duty, identity and love in all its forms. 

	











	The project is clearly geared toward the wide global fanbase of Netflix's hit period romance drama Bridgerton, also a book adaptation. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Frost executive produces with Peter Chernin, Jenno Topping and Tracey Cook of Chernin Entertainment, part of the North Road Company.


	Wharton's novel was notably adapted by Martin Scorsese in the 1993 Columbia Pictures feature starring Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer, Winona Ryder, and Miriam Margolyes.

Celebrity chef Bobby Flay is cooking up more than just culinary masterpieces. The Food Network star has confirmed his new romance with a Top Chef winner, turning a long-time friendship into a love story. 

A post shared by Bobby Flay (@bobbyflay)

Flay has confirmed his new romance with Food Network's Brooke Williamson. She was the winner of Top Chef season 14 and his co-star on Bobby's Triple Threat. Their chemistry wasn't instant, though. Williamson split from her ex-husband Nick Roberts two years ago, and their divorce was finalized in 2024. 

Flay and Williamson were just friends for years. But their dynamic suddenly changed after she split from Roberts.

“They have been friends for a while and recently decided to jump in,” a source told People. “Her divorce last year probably gave them some additional shared experiences and over the last few weeks, love bloomed.”

Williamson, who shares a son with Roberts, and Flay, a dad to daughter Sophie, 28, apparently found common ground beyond the kitchen.

In early April, Williamson and actor Jeff Bridges were honored at the No Kid Hungry Dinner in Los Angeles. The theme of the event was “Restoring hope: Feeding Kids in the Wake of the LA Wildfires,” and Flay showed his support in a big way by flying in to surprise his new love.

According to the insider, Flay's gesture was “very sweet. Williamson's Instagram lit up with photos from the event, which she captioned “best night ever.” 

Before his romance with Williamson, Flay was in a three-year relationship with Christina Pérez. However, they called it quits in June 2024. 

A post shared by HELLO! Canada Magazine (@hellocanadamag)

After splitting from Pérez, Flay opened up about love on Kristin Cavallari's “Let's Be Honest” podcast. Flay has been married three times. From 1991 to 1993, he was married to fellow chef Debra Ponzek. From 1995 to 98, he was married to TV host Kate Connelly. 

After his second divorce, Flay moved on with “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” star Stephanie March. The chef and the actress dated for four years before tying the knot in February 2005. They split a decade later amid claims that he was unfaithful. Their divorce was finalized in 2016.

“I would be interested in a life partner for sure. But I don't think it necessarily needs the documentation,” he told Cavallari, reflecting on his three marriages.

“Once you sign a document that says, ‘You are now together,' there's something that changes. When you try to explain that to people who have never been married, they don't know what you're talking about. They're like, ‘What's the difference?' And I'm like well, there is a difference but I can't really put my finger on it.”

Flay and Williamson will both appear in the new season of “Bobby's Triple Threat,” which has already been filmed and is set to air in late 2025.

Joanna Gaines is plotting for you to do the easy work in your next home renovation.

Magnolia Network has dropped a new trailer for Gaines' show “Mini Reni” that aims to feature smaller renovations that pretty much any homeowner can do.

“It doesn't have to be a dramatic renovation. It can literally be simple little details,” Gaines says. “The hope is that we can inspire you to tackle your own mini reni.”

As we reported recently, “Mini Reni” is Gaines' solo outing that will feature the host as she “takes on a series of ‘mini' projects with quick timelines. In each episode, she makes a few intentional, creative additions to transform smaller spaces with big impact.”

“As your home evolves, as the story of your family evolves, you want to make these spaces work for you,” says Gaines about the premise of the show.

“This is where I can feel a bit more freedom to try new ideas,” she adds. “And end with these fresh finished spaces that didn't require months of work.”

Gaines' popular renovation series, “Fixer Upper,” with husband Chip – as well as other shows of the same ilk – would see projects take anywhere from three to eight months to complete.

“Mini Reni” will feature nine episodes of smaller projects including a secret passageway leading to a playroom. There's also what appear to be his and her home offices in another featured space.

No matter the project, the host is looking to keep everything on budget.

“Some of these little cheats can make it feel more impactful, make it feel more elevated,” Gaines said. “But you're not spending too much to make a pretty cool impact.”

A post shared by Joanna Gaines (@joannagaines)

“How do we mess with something that's really simple that you can get at your local hardware store?” Gaines adds. 

Fans are excited about the new show. 

One commented on Instagram “Small changes with a big impact are so cool! ❤️”

Another wants ideas for their home, writing “YES 🙌🏾 I've been waiting for more mini rinis! Any tips on an apartment rini? My apartment is just too white and sterile.”

One fan is just excited to see Gaines again: “The original Queen of homestyle is back!!!!! Love this-can't wait.”

“Mini Reni” premieres Wednesday, May 14 at 8 PM on Magnolia Network before premiering on Max and Discovery Plus. The first season will run through July.

“RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars 10,” dubbed a “Tournament of All Stars,” is set to make its Paramount+ debut on Friday, May 9. The landmark season was previously revealed to feature the series' largest-ever cast – an impressive 18 queens.

Today (Wednesday, April 23), “RuPaul's Drag Race” announced which fierce drag performers would be returning to compete in “All Stars 10” during a ‘Meet the Queens' stream on YouTube, which similarly revealed that the 18 queens would be separated into three ‘Brackets' of six queens each. 

The queens within each bracket will compete against one another before the top queens from each bracket move forward to the next round of the competition, which will feature a two-episode round of competition before a lip sync “smackdown” determines the winner in the Grand Finale. Further details on the format of the season will likely be revealed during the May 9 premiere episode on Paramount+. 

Bracket One will feature Aja (Season 9, “All Stars 3”), Deja Skye (Season 14), Irene the Alien (Season 15), Phoenix (Season 3), Olivia Lux (Season 13), and Bosco (Season 14). 

Bracket Two boasts Tina Burner (Season 13), Kerri Colby (Season 15), Nicole Paige Brooks (Season 2), Mistress Isabelle Brooks (Season 15), Lydia B Kollins (Season 17), and Jorgeous (Season 14, “All Stars 9”). 

Finally, Bracket Three will include Denali (Season 13), Acid Betty (Season 8), Alyssa Hunter (Season 14), Daya Betty (Season 14), Cynthia Lee Fontaine (Season 8, 9), and Ginger Minj (Season 7, “All Stars 2”, “All Stars 6”). 

The season's casting confirms that it will feature queens from seasons old and new, with early season queens like Nicole Paige Brooks and Phoenix returning after more than a decade off the “Drag Race” stage. Conversely, Season 17 queen Lydia B Kollins was officially confirmed to be joining the “All Stars 10” cast less than a week after her original season ended (April 18, 2025), a record-breaking turn-around. 

While “Drag Race” fans will be happy to see former finalists like Mistress Isabelle Brooks and Daya Betty return for another shot at the crown, others will be excited to see queens who went home early on their original seasons, such as Irene The Alien and Alyssa Hunter, get the chance to redeem themselves on “All Stars 10.”

Big personalities won't be in short supply this season either, with a bevy of New York City queens joining the cast, including Aja, Olivia Lux, Tina Burner, and Acid Betty. Nor will big talent, with the likes of professional figure skater Denali on the roster. 

The season will similarly feature both Miss Congeniality winners like Cynthia Lee Fontaine, and series-proclaimed “Villains” like Mistress Isabelle Brooks, while also acting as a reunion of sorts for the cast of “RuPaul's Drag Race” Season 14. An impressive six queens from Season 14 will feature on the “All Stars 10” cast, including Deja Skye, Bosco, Kerri Colby, Gorgeous, Alyssa Hunter, and Daya Betty. The most recent “All Stars” series crowned Season 14 contestant, Angeria Paris van Michaels, as its winner in 2024. 

The cast will similarly feature two former “All Stars” competitors – Jorgeous and Ginger Minj. Jorgeous appeared on “All Stars 9” alongside Angeria, but failed to make the Top 3. Gorgeous returning for back-to-back “All Stars” seasons will mark a first for the series. Another “All Stars” first comes in the form of Ginger Minj, who will become the first “Drag Race” contestant to appear on three separate “All Stars” seasons. After initially appearing in Season 7, Ginger has since appeared as a contestant on “All Stars” Seasons 2 and 6. 

The 18 queens will compete for a cash prize of $200,000 and a “coveted spot” in the “Drag Race Hall of Fame.”

Nearly three years since it commenced shooting and almost five years since the original film first hit Netflix, the streamer's hit action franchise “The Old Guard” is finally readying to release its sequel. The streamer today announced that “The Old Guard 2,” the second film in the Charlize Theron-starring comic book adaptation series, will start streaming globally on Wednesday, July 2, 2025. 

The film, directed by Victoria Mahoney (who takes over from original director Gina Prince-Bythewood) comes with a script by Greg Rucka (who wrote the original comic book miniseries the films are based on) and Sarah L. Walker. And Theron, who also produces, is joined by an array of both new and returning stars, including KiKi Layne, Matthias Schoenaerts, Marwan Kenzari, Luca Marinelli, Veronica Ngô, Henry Golding, Uma Thurman, and Chiwetel Ejiofor.

Per the film's official synopsis: “Andy (Charlize Theron) and her team of immortal warriors are back, with a renewed sense of purpose in their mission to protect the world. With Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts) still in exile after his betrayal, and Quynh (Veronica Ngô) out for revenge after escaping her underwater prison, Andy grapples with her newfound mortality as a mysterious threat emerges that could jeopardize everything she's worked towards for thousands of years. Andy, Nile (KiKi Layne), Joe (Marwan Kenzari), Nicky (Luca Marinelli) and James Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) enlist the help of Tuah (Henry Golding), an old friend who may provide the key to unlocking the mystery behind immortal existence.”

Last year, Theron told Variety that the release hold-ups had been a product of various changes at both Netflix and beyond. “Netflix went through quite a changeover. We got kind of stuck in that and our post-production shut down, I think, five weeks into it,” she said. “They were going through a lot of changes, and I totally understand it. We finally picked it back up and I'm really excited about it.”

Bill Hader is back at HBO. Per Variety and confirmed by IndieWire, the “Barry” creator is co-writing a series about Jonestown, AKA the Peoples Temple Agricultural Project founded by cult leader Jim Jones.

Hader will serve as co-showrunner with “Damages” creator Daniel Zelman. The duo will also executive produce, with Hader set to direct should the project move forward at HBO. A source told IndieWire that Hader could potentially star in the series as Jones as well.

Jones founded the Peoples Temple in 1955 and established Jonestown in Guyana in 1974. Jones and more than 900 members of his Peoples Temple died in a murder-suicide by drinking Flavor Aid (not, as has become the saying, Kool-Aid) laced with cyanide at Jonestown in 1978.

“Saturday Night Live” alum Hader won two Emmys for Best Actor in a Comedy for dramedy “Barry.” The series itself garnered 16 total Emmy nominations for writer/director/creator Hader across its four seasons. “Barry” bowed in 2023. 

Hader's Jonestown series co-creator Zelman previously co-created FX series “Damages” starring Glenn Close. He later developed Netflix series “Bloodline,” and served as a consulting producer on “Succession.” 

This Jonestown project is separate from the series that “Breaking Bad” creator Vince Gilligan was developing at HBO in 2016. Leonardo DiCaprio previously executive produced docuseries “Jonestown” for Sundance TV in 2018. The actor/producer was later announced to lead MGM biopic “Jim Jones” in 2021. 

Hader said in 2023 that he had three projects in the works after “Barry,” including a “Barry”-esque horror film. Hader, whose tone for the Jonestown series has yet to be classified in any genre, previously told IndieWire that as a director, he thinks it is crucial to have a “very clear idea” of scenes. 

“It's really hard as an actor when the director doesn't know what they want and you're presenting ideas to them and they're going ‘not that, not that.' That, to me, is not really directing,” he said. “I get frustrated with directors like that as an actor. So I always want to be very clear with what I want, and then we're working together to get there and I'm just being a cheerleader and a good audience. If someone does something funny, I genuinely laugh. Or if it's emotional, I tell them, ‘Oh my God, that was great.' I think the biggest thing with actors is that they just don't want to look like idiots. … The biggest thing you do for an actor is just be encouraging and let them do their thing, and then kind of guide them.”

JoJo Siwa said her time on Celebrity Big Brother UK so far has helped her come out as queer.


	On the April 22 episode of the series, Siwa spoke with housemate Danny Beard about this shift in her identity, saying, “I feel, like, so queer, do you know what I mean? I think that's the thing. I've always told myself I'm a lesbian, and I think being here I've realized: ‘Oh, I'm not a lesbian, I'm queer.' And I think that's really cool” (via E! News).


	The singer, actress, and former Dance Moms star then jokingly exclaimed, “I'm switching letters! Fuck the ‘L,' I'm going to the ‘Q'!” (Beard, a former Drag Race UK contestant chimed in with a fantastic pun/bit of encouragement: “You are Q, honey. And you know that British people love a queue!”) 


	Siwa came out as a lesbian in 2021, but in identifying as queer, Siwa said she was open to all genders and identities (Siwa is currently dating Kath Ebbs, a content creator who identifies as non-binary). Even before this most recent revelation, Siwa has discussed her evolving gender identity and sexuality on Celebrity Big Brother. At one point, she and housemate Chris Hughes were flagged for speaking in code in violation of the show's rules, but it turned out it was a secret language to help Siwa speak more openly about “gender and how I feel.”

	She continued, “I've met a lot of females. Love them, [but] don't feel like them. Met a lot of males — love them, [but] definitely not them. Met a lot of people in my life that are nonbinary, and these beautiful nonbinary people are who I feel the most like and… I don't know, it's not something I want to say about myself yet, but it's something that is confusing.”


	But Siwa was also dragged into controversy by actor Mickey Rourke, who received a warning after making a series of homophobic remarks during production. Rourke later agreed to leave the Big Brother house over his inappropriate language as well as an encounter with Hughes that was “considered to be threatening and aggressive” (though no physical altercation took place). Rourke has since apologized, admitting he “stepped over the line.”

	The Irish rap group Kneecap have never shied away from politics, and their recent sets at Coachella sparked controversy after they included messages defending Palestine during their performances on both weekends. In an email to Rolling Stone, band member Mo Chara explained that Kneecap have spoken about Palestine “at every single gig since the band's formation, long before October 2023 as the oppression and brutal occupation of Palestine has been ongoing for 77 years,” and responded to some of the criticism that's followed.


	“We believe we have an obligation to use our platform when we can to raise the issue of Palestine, and it was important for us to speak out at Coachella as the USA is the main funder and supplier of weapons to Israel as they commit genocide in Gaza,” he says. “As I said from the stage, ‘The U.S. government could stop the genocide tomorrow.' It's important that young Americans hear and know it.”


	During its first Coachella performance, the band had planned to have several projections with pro-Palestine text on them. However, these didn't make it onstage, and the set was cut short on Coachella's YouTube livestream. “We only heard about it the next day and haven't heard from anyone officially,” Mo Chara tells Rolling Stone. “It's not surprising, large companies don't like to hear the truth unless it suits their narrative and pocket.”

	The second weekend, the projections read, “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,” followed by, “It is being enabled by the U.S. government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes.” A final screen said, “Fuck Israel. Free Palestine.” At the end, the crowd launched into a “Free Palestine” chant. “This is something that happens at all of our gigs from Spain to Scotland and Ireland to Iceland because people know what's happening is wrong and are angry about it,” Mo Chara writes. “The crowd chanting ‘Free Palestine' at Coachella was a message of solidarity to the people of Gaza from regular Americans who want to see an end to the genocide, despite their government's arming and funding Israel.”

	The performance ignited major backlash, with organizations and public figures alike speaking out and describing the set as anti-Israel. (“Israel has murdered over 52,000 Palestinians in Gaza in the last 18 months, mostly women and children,” Mo Chara writes. “They have obliterated much of the Gaza Strip with U.S.-supplied weapons and are currently starving over 2 million Gazans. People can make their own decisions about whether our message is anti-Israel, but for us, it's about their government's sickening actions, not ordinary people.”) On X, Sharon Osbourne urged people to advocate for revoking band members' visas, saying that their projections displayed “anti-Israel messages and hate speech” and that they “openly support terrorist organizations.” Asked about Osbourne's tweets, Mo Chara responded, “Her rant has so many holes in it that it hardly warrants a reply, but she should listen to ‘War Pigs' that was written by Black Sabbath (her husband).”

	











	Organizers of the Nova Music Festival, the site of the deadly Hamas attack that preceded Israel's crackdown on Gaza, also invited the band to the Nova Exhibition to “experience firsthand the stories of those who were murdered, those who survived, and those who are still being held hostage.”

	Mo Chara didn't respond to questions about whether they'd accept that offer, but said simply, “There are over 10,000 Palestinians being held hostage in Israeli jails as we speak, many of them without charge or trial, including 400 children who are being held illegally under international law. As I said already, over 52,000 Palestinians have been murdered in the last 18 months, and over 2 million displaced in Gaza. Who is talking about the 30,000 innocent children who have been murdered in Gaza in the last 18 months?… Our message is about ending the genocide and ending the ongoing illegal occupation of Palestine.”


	He adds: “We want people to take whatever action they can to stop the genocide. People can take what they want from our music, stopping the genocide is more important.”

Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is begging President Donald Trump to reconsider the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) denial of an emergency disaster declaration to aid in the recovery from a series of destructive tornadoes and storms that ravaged the red state in March. 


	Sanders, a former White House press secretary to Trump, wrote a lengthy letter last week to her ex-boss detailing the damage caused by the storms and begging him reconsider FEMA's denial. 


	“The severe storms and tornadoes that occurred on March 14 and 15, 2025, produced catastrophic impacts across the state. The sheer magnitude of this event resulted in overwhelming amounts of debris, widespread destruction to homes and businesses, the tragic loss of three lives and injuries to many others. Less than three weeks later, Arkansas was once again devastated by a second wave of severe storms, tornadoes, and a generational flooding event,” Sanders wrote in her appeal. “Without the support of a Major Disaster Declaration, Arkansas will face significant challenges in assuming full responsibility and achieving an effective recovery from this event. I have determined that the severity and magnitude of these storms exceed the capabilities of the State and affected local governments to respond adequately. As such, supplemental Federal assistance is crucial.”

	











	It's unsurprising that states are already struggling to get disaster-recovery aid under the second Trump administration. In January, Trump floated eliminating the agency entirely. Last month, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem promised to “eliminate FEMA,” on the heels of a series of so-called Department of Government Efficiency-fueled layoffs at the agency.

	During his first term, Trump had a habit of setting up roadblocks to states requesting disaster-relief aid depending on his personal relationship with — or the politics of — their leadership. The president once held out on approving aid funds for regions of California scorched by wildfires until staff presented him with evidence that people in the affected areas were actually his fans. In another instance, he ignored requests from Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, for funds to respond to a series of wildfires in 2020.

	During the 2024 election cycle, Trump falsely accused FEMA and the Biden administration of “stealing” billions in disaster aid to support undocumented migrants, while leaving parts of North Carolina devastated by Hurricane Helene to fend for themselves. 


	When wildfires ravaged Los Angeles earlier this year, the president and his GOP allies floated conditioning aid to California with compliance to their own policy and ideological goals. These included forcing the implementation of Voter ID laws, and crackdowns on immigration.

	Trump and Republicans have been salivating at the idea of eliminating the agency — because they think it would save money, or they want states to handle their own disaster relief, or both. But as Sanders wrote in her plea to Trump, Arkansas is unable to handle the recovery effort without federal funds. The thing about natural disasters is that they don't have any conception of state lines, nor do they check your voter registration before leveling your house, which is why an agency like FEMA exists to coordinate the response to disasters that span multiple states, some of which might not have the resources to combat the destruction.


	While Trump and Noem are making hay over their plans to destroy FEMA, members of their own party are begging them to stand down.

							By 

	Meagan Jordan



	Since March 5, Ash Wednesday, Black congregations around the nation have stopped patronizing Target for Lent. The 40-day fast, led by Dr. Jamal Bryant, pastor of New Birth Missionary Church in Stonecrest, Georgia, was in response to Target's compliance with President Donald Trump's orders to get rid of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives because of claims of “discrimination.” Target not only rescinded many DEI efforts for employees — joining American corporations like Amazon, Walmart, McDonald's, Ford, and Paramount — but reneged on its REACH (racial, equity, action, and change) initiative to invest more than $2 billion into Black-owned businesses by the end of 2025, following the murder of George Floyd in 2020.


	During the fast, Target's stock prices have sunk, seeing its biggest drop in four years at $88.73 per share in the beginning of April, from $266.38 a share in November 2021. The store's foot traffic has also declined significantly, dropping to single-digit percentages, the lowest it has been since the fast started. Nearly 200,000 people have registered for the Target fast at a website constructed by Bryant's church, which provides instructions and more than 300,000 shopping alternatives patrons can utilize to find their needs. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	With Lent now over, and Christians able to resume their vices, Bryant and churches throughout the country are now pivoting from a Target fast into a full-on boycott — and they intend to add on other businesses, which will be announced in the coming days. In a Tuesday night town hall at the Salem Bible Church in Lithonia, Georgia, Black business owners and community members gathered to hear next steps for the movement. In a livestream to more than 1,000 people on Facebook and YouTube, Bryant announced, “Target has crucified its integrity on a cross called humanity, and regrettably for them, there will be no Easter. You cannot resurrect when your intention was never for the people. You cannot be an ally for the oligarch and forget the marginalized and the oppressed.” Target's CEO Brian Cornell requested a meeting with Bryant and Al Sharpton last week. The corporation did not respond to Rolling Stone's request for comment.

	“Forty days is not the end — it's the benchmark,” Bryant, who was the youth director for the NAACP, tells Rolling Stone. Although Target wasn't the only store to roll back its inclusive hiring practices, Bryant set his sights on the chain — which is based in Minneapolis where Floyd was murdered — because of its erasure of DEI and REACH initiatives and the economic support it receives from the American Black community at large. “It's one of the highest employers of Black people in the country, and then [they] walked away from its pledge for George Floyd after the election of Donald Trump, so we wanted to target them first,” he said.

	The Target fast has ignited conversations about the Black dollar and how Black consumership keeps the American economy afloat, despite Black Americans having the least amount of wealth in the country. “This is a mark to the country that Black America realizes its spending power, and shows what we can do when we unify our voices and our focus,” Bryant tells Rolling Stone. “People are going to have to be more selective under this Trump-Elon administration with tariffs abounding.” 


	In an attempt to create an economic system among the Black community, Bryant has put a lot of focus on “spending Black,” going as far as to create a Black Mall initiative, where Black vendors set up shop to sell their goods, at four other Black megachurches in the nation on Easter weekend. At Bryant's church alone, at least 100 Black vendors set up shop, where consumers had direct access to Black businesses, promoting their own marketplace. “We're looking to multiply it and have 10 to 20 churches participate on Juneteenth weekend,” says Bryant. “The churches are really stretching their muscles to become involved and engaged.”

Was a UFO successfully captured on camera in Mexico?

There are few topics on the internet capable of generating more attention than debates and speculation about UFOs and unknown objects in the sky.

Americans are obsessed with whatever is going on up there. Part of the issue is we have no clear answers, despite getting new videos and photos on a pretty regular basis.

That leads us to a new story out of Mexico.

The popular UFO Instagram page @ufo5537 shared a bunch of pictures that allegedly show a UFO photographed near Chiapas.

The post is blowing up, and you'll understand why once you see the pictures. It's arguably the greatest and clearest UFO pictures the internet has ever seen……but does it pass the smell test?

I hate to pour cold water on all the hype, but if you asked me on a scale of zero to 100 how much faith I have in these photos, I'd put the number somewhere around .5.

What are the odds an actual UFO happened to be flying over Mexico near someone with a camera, and it looks *EXACTLY* like UFOs from all the movies we enjoy?

Seriously, what are the odds? Seems like it's borderline impossible. Convenient? Sure. Likely? A snowball drenched in gasoline rolling through the gates of hell and surviving has better odds of happening.

I don't think I will ever be signing up for something as fast as this: a famous (and possibly haunted) Duluth attraction is letting you onboard for a special experience.

If you live in Duluth or visit often, chances are you've been onboard the William A. Irvin, located in the heart of Canal Park.

The freighter always opens seasonally for tours, so you can truly get that Duluth experience when you visit town or have visitors in town.

That will be the case once again for long weekends beginning on Friday, May 2nd. It will open every day of the week later the following month, on June 12th. These tours are family friendly - but this isn't the only experience you can get aboard the ship!

This year, you have a chance to tour the ship in a new and haunted way! You can board the William A. Irvin with your ghost hunting equipment and tour the ship looking for all things that go bump in the night.

As of now, there will only be two dates in which you can take advantage of this special tour. The first tour will take place on Friday, June 13th from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. There will be another option on Tuesday, August 26th during the same time period.

Tickets are $75 bucks. If you want to take one of these paranormal tours, grab your fellow supernatural-loving friends, your ghost hunting equipment and get your name in the books! You will have to sign a contract and waiver and bring your own equipment.

You can schedule your place on either tour by emailing organizers at hauntedship@decc.org. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, as paranormal investigators are not often allowed on the vessel for personal or individual tours.

There have long been rumors that the William A. Irvin is actually haunted, and I am not just talking about the annual haunted ship attraction that pops up every Halloween. Many ghost hunters that have investigated the ship have all but confirmed the freighter is indeed haunted.

Staff on the ship have reported 'the sensation of being watched' and heard 'mysterious footsteps' on the ship when its been empty. Why don't you sign up and see for yourself? I want to!","{'href': 'https://b105country.com', 'title': 'Duluth Country Radio'}","other"

Lanterns has been filming for a while at this stage, but we have word on yet another late addition to the cast of the DC Studios/HBO series.

Deadline reports that veteran actor Paul Ben-Victor (Nobody Wants This) is set for a key recurring role as Antaan, ""an extraterrestrial devoted to exposing the truth and exacting vengeance against those who wronged his people. Consumed by a deep and unrelenting hatred for the law, he is determined to deliver justice on his own terms.""

Antaan isn't an established DC Comics character, and based on the description above, there's speculation that Ben-Victor could actually be playing Atrocitus.

Introduced in Green Lantern vol. 4 #25 back in 2008, Atros witnessed the deaths of his wife and children when the rogue Manhunters laid waste to Space Sector 666. Renaming himself ""Atrocitus"", he and four survivors formed a terrorist cabal known as the Five Inversions, who made it their mission to destroy the Guardians of the Universe and all who served them.

There's always a chance this Antaan is an original character created for the show, but it would seem like an odd move when Atrocitus' backstory and motivations are so similar.



This is who I was teasing when I said there would be another villain in Lanterns. I believed he would be Atrocitus but they're still referring to him as Antaan. Also I know they wanted to cast a tall actor but he's is 5'7. Not sure if it's Atrocitus in disguise or an OC https://t.co/7FkndNZbKi

MOSCOW, April 23. /TASS/. The Sultan of Oman has visited Moscow, US President Donald Trump is expected to unveil his peace plan for Ukraine soon, and Russia may involve Washington in investigations of Ukrainian war crimes. These stories topped the headlines in Wednesday's newspapers across Russia.

 

Russian President Vladimir Putin has welcomed a second Arab leader to the Kremlin within a week. Following the April 17 official visit of Emir of Qatar Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Sultan of Oman Haitham bin Tariq Al Said arrived in Russia on April 22.

This marks the first high-level encounter between the leaders of Russia and Oman since diplomatic relations were established 40 years ago. The 1985 agreement was signed precisely by Al Said, who was a deputy foreign minister at the time. Heightened interest in the meeting with Oman's sultan stems from the fact that his country serves as a key intermediary in discussions on the nuclear deal between Iran and the US.

It is possible that the sultan conveyed confidential aspects of the deal to the Russian leadership, said Ilya Vaskin, junior research fellow at the Center for Middle East, Caucasus, and Central Asia Studies at the Higher School of Economics. He believes that the sultan may have relayed the US and Iran's shared position on Russia's involvement in the revised nuclear deal: ""Russia's potential role is to be a facilitator or mediator between the US and Iran, specifically regarding the deal. For most other matters, there are international bodies and the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in the Hague. Moreover, based on earlier media reports, Moscow might assume responsibility for certain technical elements of the deal, such as transferring nuclear fuel from Iran to Russia.""

Sergey Balmasov, an expert at the Institute of the Middle East, agrees that the Iranian nuclear issue was central to the talks. Currently, Oman's capital acts as a bridge between Tehran and Western nations, while Moscow is actively engaged in supporting Iran's peaceful nuclear pursuits, the expert noted.

""Evidently, the US-Iran dialogue on the nuclear issue has not yet yielded any significant advancement, due to the entrenched positions of both parties. Oman is therefore counting on Russia's help in achieving a potential breakthrough in the negotiations. Tehran is unlikely to accept a new deal modeled on the previous one without firm guarantees of its enforcement,"" the expert explained.

Oman has long played the role of a go-between for Iran and the West, said Murad Sadygzade, president of the Center for Middle East Research: ""The recent visits to Moscow by the Qatari emir and Omani sultan are connected to the ongoing Middle East dynamics, as these countries aim to reduce the risk of a major regional conflict, which could bring significant economic and political consequences for the Middle East and North Africa, including the Persian Gulf states.""

All these matters are part of the dialogue—from Syria to Iran, from regional stability to a new security framework, the expert said: ""Russia, as one of the key players in the Middle East, could become one of the guarantors of a new Iranian accord, similar to its role in the previous JCPOA agreement,"" Sadygzade noted. He emphasized that Moscow is among the most trusted international actors by Tehran, and Iran may view Russia as a reliable mediator.

An emerging easing of tensions between Moscow and Washington also points to some encouraging signs, the expert observed: ""If a Ukraine agreement is reached and ties between Moscow and Washington are renewed, Russia could become a neutral broker to assist with the US-Iran negotiations."" In this light, Oman retains significance, as since 2013 it has proven its value as a trusted mediator in global conflicts—by the Iranians, Americans, and Saudis alike—having played a role in facilitating the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Sadygzade added.

 

In the near future, US President Donald Trump is expected to unveil his strategy for resolving the Ukrainian conflict, which may involve the deployment of European forces in Ukraine following a truce between Moscow and Kiev, a senior White House official told the New York Post (NYP).

It is anticipated that the US will present the specifics of its peace initiative to the Russian leadership during a visit by US Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff. According to Russian Presidential Aide Yury Ushakov, Witkoff is scheduled to visit Moscow this week.

Russia is unlikely to accept the stationing of European troops in the conflict area, believes Alexander Kamkin, an associate professor at the Financial University. According to him, such a development would revert the Russian-Ukrainian crisis to the dynamics of the Minsk-2 agreement, while Kiev would still be supplied with arms. That said, the expert did not exclude the possibility of positioning Europeans along the line of contact as part of a UN peacekeeping force. ""The US is more invested than anyone in having European troops in Ukraine, primarily to safeguard their investments and infrastructure through a proxy,"" the political scientist added.

The presence of European soldiers in Ukraine remains unacceptable for Moscow, agrees Lev Sokolshchik, a researcher at the HSE Center for Comprehensive Economic and Social Studies. This proposal mainly reflects American interests, allowing Washington to reduce expenditures on Ukraine by transferring this responsibility to Europe, the expert noted: ""Moscow has consistently opposed this plan, arguing that the deployment of NATO troops in Ukraine is the underlying cause of the conflict.

The most favorable scenario for Russia would be the establishment of peacekeeping forces and a joint committee including Russian, Ukrainian, and other delegates. In theory, representatives from the SCO or BRICS could serve as the third party.""

However, even with such a structure, the peace process would remain fragile, since, according to Sokolshchik, it would not rule out ongoing provocations from both Ukraine and European countries.

 

Russia is prepared to involve observers from the US and other nations in investigations into crimes allegedly committed by Ukrainian forces, Rodion Miroshnik, the Russian Foreign Ministry's special envoy, told Izvestia. Their role may include ensuring openness in the investigation process and legal proceedings. Since 2014, the Russian Investigative Committee has initiated over 6,500 criminal cases related to war crimes, with more than 500 individuals already convicted. Experts believe various countries could participate in monitoring investigations into the actions of the Ukrainian military.

The US was backing and supporting the Kiev regime during the Biden administration. However, with Donald Trump's return, Washington has been reassessing its position on Russia and engaging in dialogue with Moscow. For example, this was evident during the contentious vote against an anti-Russian resolution at the UN General Assembly. As a result, the US might now be open to joining efforts to investigate Ukrainian war crimes, Deputy Director of the Institute of History and Politics at Moscow State Pedagogical University Vladimir Shapovalov told Izvestia.

The necessity of ensuring accountability for breaches of international law will be part of any potential peace agreements on Ukraine, Miroshnik stated in his interview with the newspaper.

There is a long-standing precedent for representatives from different nations taking part in investigations into war crimes and crimes against humanity, such as genocide. Most countries are interested in observing this process — except those actively backing the Kiev regime. The International Public Tribunal on Ukraine is already operating in Russia, yet according to Shapovalov, a new international body to investigate Ukrainian war crimes must be established.

 

Japan has shifted its attitude toward concluding a peace treaty with Russia following the onset of talks between Russia and the US. Tokyo intends to reopen peace treaty negotiations with Moscow ""as soon as the situation allows,"" the Japanese Embassy told Izvestia. This is a notable change in rhetoric, since previously Tokyo only mentioned the intention to return to the discussion. This may be linked to Japan anticipating the conclusion of the Ukraine conflict in order to lift anti-Russian sanctions and create a more favorable climate for negotiations, experts believe. The Russian side has repeatedly stated that it is ready for dialogue only if Tokyo abandons its hostile policy course. That said, so far no shifts in Japan's foreign policy can be perceived, with reports that the country's authorities have decided to share satellite data with the Ukrainian Defense Ministry Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR).

""Japan is waiting for the Ukraine conflict to be resolved. Moreover, I can confirm that in private conversations, Japanese diplomats mention that following the conflict's resolution, Japan will be ready for a full restoration of ties with Russia and the lifting of sanctions,"" Vladimir Nelidov, senior researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Oriental Studies, told Izvestia.

Given the improvement in general relations following the end of the conflict, the talks on the peace agreement may indeed restart, the expert noted.

""There is an impression of uncertainty in Japan's foreign policy course with regard to Russia. On the one hand, given the Russia-US thaw, common sense suggests the need to reengage in dialogue with Russia, which is important from the perspective of energy and food security, as well as the interests of car manufacturers who may be affected by new US tariffs. On the other hand, Japan continues with a wait-and-see approach,"" Olga Dobrinskaya, senior researcher with the Center of Japanese Studies at the Institute of China and Contemporary Asia of the Russian Academy of Sciences, noted in the conversation with the newspaper.

""Japanese companies are exploring their options since certain progress has appeared toward a political resolution of the crisis. They are generally quite pragmatic and disinclined to take risks. If the overall environment for the operations of foreign companies in Russia improves and the risks of secondary sanctions decline, a new wave will begin — and Japanese companies will be among the first to return,"" Nelidov noted.

 

Gold prices have risen by another $100 over 24 hours, reaching another milestone of $3,500 per ounce. The increase outpaced forecasts by analysts and investment banks and theoretically, gold may hit the $4,000 mark before the end of this year.

One of the main reasons for the rapid rise of gold prices is the trade war initiated by Donald Trump in early April. ""Trade wars exacerbate the global uncertainty, increase the risks of global recession, fuel trends toward de-globalization and fragmentation of the global economy. As a result, investors are actively turning to safe-haven assets, such as gold and the Swiss franc,"" said Sovcombank Chief Analyst Mikhail Vasilyev.

According to him, an additional trigger emerged last week, when reports broke out that Trump wants to fire Jerome Powell, chair of the US Federal Reserve, and force the Fed to lower interest rates. ""This increases the risks of the US Central Bank losing its independence which further undermines investors' trust in US assets, the dollar and the current dollar-centric financial system,"" Vasilyev added.

There is also a new factor which seriously affected the current surge in prices. ""We are observing that the inflows of funds to gold exchange-traded funds have reached a record-setting level last week, substantially surpassing decade-old highs,"" Tsifra Broker analyst Ivan Yefanov explained.

Vasilyev believes that gold may continue climbing in price while Trump is negotiating the tariffs and putting pressure on the Fed. ""If the global uncertainty due to Trump's policy continues to grow, then gold may rise to $3,800-4,000 per ounce in the coming months,"" he concluded.

As he does one day each month, the Rev. Robert Turner hit the road from his home in Baltimore last week and traveled — on foot — 43 miles (69 kilometers) to Washington.

He arrived by evening on April 16 outside the White House, carrying a sign that called for for “Reparations Now.”

This time, Turner added another stop on his long day's journey — the National Museum of African American History and Culture.

Turner knelt in prayer and laid a wreath at the entrance of the museum in support of its mission, which incurred President Donald Trump's criticism alongside other Smithsonian Institution sites. In a March 27 executive order, Trump alleged that Smithsonian exhibits had disparaged the nation's history via a “divisive, race-centered ideology.”

Turner wanted to show support for the museum, which opened in 2016 and received its 10 millionth visitor in 2023. The museum tells the history of chattel slavery, Jim Crow segregation and its lingering effects, but it also highlights the determination, successes and contributions of Black Americans and Black institutions.

“I laid my wreath down there to show solidarity with the museum and the history that they present every day,” said Turner, pastor of Empowerment Temple African Methodist Episcopal Church in Baltimore. 

He said his church has committed to becoming a museum member, and he's encouraged church members to do the same. Membership costs start at $25 per year, according to an online form on the museum site.

His church is not alone, as other predominantly Black congregations are taking similar steps.

Turner said he got the idea from the Rev. Otis Moss III of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, whose church also joined the museum and who urged members to do the same. “For only $25 a year, you can protect Black history,” Moss told his church.

Two other Black pastors told The Associated Press they also supported the effort.

One was the Rev. Jacqui J. Lewis, senior minister at Middle Church in New York City — home to a multiracial congregation affiliated with the United Church of Christ.

“We belonged to the museum since its opening, and we just made another donation to them in light of this administration's policies,” she told the AP. The gift, she said, was a $1,000 “Easter Love donation.”

Bishop Timothy Clarke of the First Church of God in Columbus, Ohio, said he would be emulating Moss in making an appeal to his predominantly African American congregation.

“Our grandson is in DC on a field trip,” Clarke said in an email. “The highlight of his trip has been the visit to the Museum.”

Trump's order didn't specifically talk about budget cuts, though it tasked Vice President JD Vance, a member of the Smithsonian Board of Regents by virtue of his office, to lead the effort to purge “improper ideology” from such institutions. He pledged to “restore the Smithsonian Institution to its rightful place as a symbol of inspiration and American greatness.” Critics say he's trying to force a distorted national narrative that glosses over slavery and other historical wrongs.

Turner said he has been making his walk to Washington one day for each of the past 31 months. He's calling for the U.S. to make reparations for the legacy of slavery, Jim Crow segregation and other systemic suffering inflicted on Black people, ranging from housing and medical discrimination to mass incarceration. When he was previously a pastor in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he similarly demonstrated for reparations for the 1921 race massacre.

Turner said when he arrived last week outside the White House, a crowd of visitors was milling about, and one child who noticed his sign asked a parent, “What is reparations?”

“That to me is a perfect manifestation about why we need to be teaching more true history of America, and not taking away certain subjects because they make people feel uncomfortable,” Turner said.

Moss, in a social media post, held out hope that the museum could continue its current course, noting that Vance is just one member of the board. 

Trinity has long been socially active with a wide array of community outreaches, and Moss describes it as “a church that is unashamedly Black and unapologetically Christian.”

Former President Barack Obama had been a member of Trinity but resigned during the 2008 campaign, citing the “divisive” statements of its previous pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, while affirming the Black Church tradition of speaking out against injustice.

The African American museum, one of 21 Smithsonian museums, has also seen a recent shake-up in leadership. Shanita Beckett, who was previously the head of operations at the museum, has been widely reported to be serving as interim director.

Kevin Young, a poet and scholar of African American history, left his role as museum director in early April, following a leave of absence, according to a notice to staff. The museum did not return the AP's requests for comment this week.

On Friday, Democrats on the House Administration Committee, which has oversight over the Smithsonian Institution, expressed concern over the executive order in a letter addressed to Vance.

“This flagrant attempt to erase Black history is unacceptable and must be stopped,” said the letter signed by Reps. Joseph Morelle of New York, Terri Sewell of Alabama and Norma Torres of California. 

“The attempt to paper over elements of American history is both cowardly and unpatriotic,” the letter said.

Vice President JD Vance spoke to reporters Tuesday during a visit to India after Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that he would not attend talks in London aimed at ending the war.

President Donald Trump slammed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement on Crimea, saying it was ""very harmful"" to peacemaking efforts.

""It's inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy's that make it so difficult to settle this war,"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. ""He has nothing to boast about! The situation for Ukraine is dire — He can have peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole country.""

Trump also rejected Zelenskyy's red line in the Truth Social post, saying it was ""not even a point of discussion,"" as the territory was ""lost years ago"" under then-President Barack Obama.

VANCE ISSUES ULTIMATUM TO RUSSIA, UKRAINE ON PEACE NEGOTIATIONS

American officials have apparently floated the idea of recognizing Russia's control of Crimea, a territory that Russia seized in 2014, as part of a ceasefire proposal. This would also involve the freezing of current frontlines.

In 2022, Zelenskyy said that the ""Russian war against Ukraine and against the entire free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea — and its liberation,"" Axios reported. He reiterated this stance on Tuesday, shutting down the idea that Ukraine would recognize Russian control of Crimea.

""Ukraine will not legally recognize the occupation of Crimea,"" Zelenskyy said at a press conference here on Tuesday, according to the Wall Street Journal. ""There's nothing to talk about here. This is against our constitution.""

NIKKI HALEY ON RUSSIA AND UKRAINE SAYS US SHOULD 'WANT TO BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY'

This is not the first time Trump has criticized Zelenskyy's statements about the war. During their infamous meeting in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, Trump said that Zelenskyy's ""hatred"" of Russian President Vladimir Putin was making it ""very tough"" to make a deal.

""You see the hatred he's got for Putin, it's very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hate, he's got tremendous hatred,"" Trump told reporters. ""And I understand that, but I can tell you the other side isn't exactly in love with, you know, him either.""

TRUMP INSISTS UKRAINE-RUSSIA PEACE DEAL IS CLOSE, BUT MISTRUST IN PUTIN LEAVES EXPERTS SKEPTICAL

Trump appeared to allude to the Oval Office meeting in his Truth Social post, calling Zelenskyy ""the man with no cards to play."" This echoed Trump's remark during the tense February meeting in which he said that Zelenskyy didn't ""have the cards"" to make major demands in peace talks.

While Zelenskyy has made his demands clear, it remains uncertain what might persuade Putin to agree to a ceasefire. Although Trump administration officials have stated that they have had productive conversations with Putin, they have yet to get Russia to agree to a ceasefire proposal.

Earlier on Wednesday, Vice President JD Vance suggested that the U.S. was prepared to walk away from peace talks if Ukraine and Russia did not reach a deal soon.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Democrats see plummeting support from young people, dipping below Trump and GOP","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/3388954/young-americans-harvard-democratic-party-poll-trump-gop/","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 19:35:02 GMT","

The Democratic Party‘s favorability has dipped across the board since the 2024 election, and a new survey shows its standing has dramatically slipped with younger voters in recent years.

The Harvard Youth Poll from the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School, released Wednesday, shows that young people are not impressed with Democrats in Congress. Their support for congressional Democrats falls below that of congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump.

In the survey, conducted with 2,096 18-to-29-year-olds last month, just 23% approved of the job congressional Democrats are doing, compared to 29% who approve of congressional Republicans' job performance and 32% who approve of Trump's job performance.

In Harvard's 2017 and 2020 youth polls, congressional Democrats had significantly higher approval ratings than their GOP counterparts or Trump. In less than five years, their approval rating has dropped 25% among young people. Through the 2017, 2020, and 2025 polls, young people's views on Republicans in Congress and Trump have remained stable, only fluctuating a couple of percentage points.

While Trump's job performance rating, 31%, was nearly identical to 2017's 32% and slightly up from 2020's 29%, the demographic breakdown shifted. In the 2017 survey, Trump only had 6% approval from young black people, compared to 16% in the 2025 poll, while his rating with young white people dropped from 44% in 2017 to 39% in 2025.

DEMOCRATIC PARTY TROUBLES MOUNT AS MORE VOTERS TURN RIGHT, GIVE GOP EDGE

Trump and Republicans made gains with key Democratic strongholds in the 2024 election, including young voters, as he won the White House and became the first Republican since 2004 to win the popular vote. In 2020, Trump lost young voters 60% to 36%, but in 2024, he only lost the group 54% to 43%, according to CNN exit polls.

While Democrats have aimed to regain ground with these demographics, some have insisted that messaging is not the problem. In an appearance on MSNBC last week, Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC), an influential Democrat, deferred blame to the media for the party's poor polling figures.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

His proposal to end the war isn't a peace plan—it's a reward for aggression.

Donald Trump said on the campaign trail that he would make peace between Ukraine and Russia in a day. Three months later, he's behind schedule, and his plan now is to end the fighting quickly by selling out Ukraine and its people to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The proposal that Trump, Vice President J. D. Vance, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are pushing is not a framework for peace, but a rich and bloody reward to Moscow for three years of aggression and war crimes.

The Russians might do some performative caviling, but the Americans are offering Putin a dream of a deal. If Trump has his way, Washington will lift sanctions against Russia; both sides will accept a cease-fire in place (leaving Russian troops on newly conquered Ukrainian territory), and the United States will agree to recognize Crimea as part of Russia (leaving the Kremlin with full ownership of previously conquered territory).

For this, Ukraine gets basically nothing, except a vaporous security guarantee from an American president who has made clear his hostility to Ukraine and its leaders, an animus that became especially clear when Trump and Vance ambushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a White House meeting last month. The Trump “peace” plan is no such thing; it is an instrument of surrender, and the Ukrainians are unlikely to accept it.

Trump's proposal would functionally destroy Ukraine, which would limp away from the deal as a vulnerable rump state, shorn of some 20 percent of its territory and millions of its citizens. It would cede control over its foreign policy by promising never to join NATO—an ironic Russian demand, given how starkly Putin's invasion has reminded the world why alliances such as NATO must continue to exist. But NATO membership is a distant issue compared with the immediate problem: If Kyiv agrees to Trump's proposal, whatever is left of the Ukrainian state will soon be an easy target for the Kremlin. Once the Russian economy recovers and Russia's forces catch their breath, Putin will finish the job of conquering Ukraine with even greater vengeance and violence. Time and space are on Moscow's side, and Trump intends to give Putin plenty of both.

Jonathan Chait: The simple explanation for why Trump turned against Ukraine

The Americans have threatened to walk away from the process if either side refuses Trump's deal, but no one can believe that this is even a token attempt to pressure Moscow. The White House is aiming its rhetorical fire squarely at Zelensky. Earlier today, Trump ranted at Zelensky on his Truth Social media platform, telling the Ukrainian president that he “can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country. We are very close to a Deal, but the man with ‘no cards to play' should now, finally, GET IT DONE.” Zelensky, for his part, continues to insist on an “immediate, full, and unconditional cease-fire” before he agrees to further negotiations, a position Trump will likely use as a pretext for abandoning further talks.

Vance, meanwhile, has adopted a classic position of moral equivalence, as if the people shooting at each other—and their reasons for fighting—are indistinguishable. “The only way to really stop the killing,” he said in India today, “is for the armies to both put down their weapons, to freeze this thing, and to get on with the business of actually building a better Russia and a better Ukraine.”  (The vice president might just be toeing Trump's line, but if his previous statements on international affairs are a guide, he really does seem to have a dismally simplistic understanding of geopolitics. He showcased this strategic shallowness during his embarrassing speech in Munich in February, when he scolded America's allies about their domestic politics, as if the Europeans were merely a collection of unimportant U.S. congressional delegations.)

We need not invoke World War II comparisons to recognize the moral and political vacuity of the Trump-Vance position. Instead, imagine intervening in other wars of aggression, such as the Korean War in 1950, and telling the embattled southern forces after Pyongyang's massive invasion that both sides “need to put down their weapons and build a better North and South Korea.” Or perhaps after Iraq attempted to erase Kuwait from the map in 1990, America and the United Nations should have told the states of the Persian Gulf that sometimes countries just disappear, and that both Saddam Hussein's army and what was left of Kuwait's forces needed to put their guns down.

Trump is not a fair broker: He is acting as a de facto Russian ally and making demands as Moscow's proxy. Perhaps Europe and other nations will be able to fill the void left by American cowardice, but no one should blame the Ukrainians if they refuse to bow to Washington's demand that they accept a grim destiny as Moscow's newest serfs.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","The Big Tech vs. Europe war just ratcheted up. But Trump is also taking on Big Tech.","https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-meta-big-tech-eu-fine-donald-trump-tariffs-negotiation-2025-4","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:34:00 GMT","

The European Union has fined Apple and Meta a combined $800 million for violating antitrust laws.

Is that a big deal?

On the one hand, not at all.

If Apple and Meta end up paying the fines — both companies say they will appeal the rulings from the European Commission — the financial impact will be minimal to the tech giants' bottom lines. Apple generates $93.7 billion in profit a year; Meta does $23.9 billion.

On the other hand, both Apple and Meta are positioning the judgments as fundamental attacks on their businesses. Meta even argues that Europe is attacking America itself.

""The European Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards,"" Meta comms and policy head Joel Kaplan said in a statement Wednesday.

Apple also weighed in: ""Today's announcements are yet another example of the European Commission unfairly targeting Apple in a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free.""

The specifics of Europe's complaints about Meta and Apple have to do with the Digital Markets Act. Those rules are meant to constrain the power of giant tech companies — meaning US companies.

In Apple's case, Europe is fining the company because it says it's not complying with rules meant to force Apple to open its powerful App Store to competition. In Meta's case, Europe says the company didn't offer a version of its services that uses less of consumers' personal data.

Both complaints preceded Donald Trump's second presidential victory. But both Apple and Meta are clearly hoping that Trump sees them as something that can be negotiated away as part of his administration's tariff wars. Something like ""Europe drops these charges against US tech companies, and the US cuts back on the 20% tariff it's planning to levy on Europe.""

At various times, that has seemed like something Trump and his team are interested in pursuing. Like in February, when Trump issued a memo, written with Europe in mind, vowing to ""defend American companies and innovators from overseas extortion.""

And there's speculation that the EU, which could have fined both Apple and Meta up to 10% of their total annual revenue, came down with much smaller fines because it didn't want to aggravate tariff tensions.

Except … that same Trump administration has been causing headaches of its own for Big Tech companies.

Its on-again/off-again tariffs could cause the price of Apple products to skyrocket, depending on how or if they are implemented. They could also damage Meta by cutting off billions in ad dollars from Chinese companies.

More to the point: The US government itself is currently in court against Meta, arguing that the company should be broken up because of antitrust violations.

It's a pretty baffling set of contradictions. Perhaps the most generous way of interpreting them would be something like: The White House wants to keep Big Tech in line — but it wants to do it itself.

As we've learned, trying to predict what the Trump administration is going to do about just about anything — and especially on trade — is a very difficult task.

On Wednesday, for instance, markets are surging in part because Trump just signaled that he's going to soften his approach to China. But maybe that will be different Thursday or next week. So it's certainly too early to tell what Wednesday's actions mean for Big Tech will ultimately mean.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","BAE Systems says it's nailed a way to meet the UK's need for a lot of ammunition — and fast","https://www.businessinsider.com/bae-systems-new-tech-increase-uk-ammo-supply-fast-ukraine-2025-4","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 09:32:00 GMT","

BAE Systems says it's about to radically increase its production of 155mm shells, leaning on advances in how it produces munitions.

The UK defense contractor said its new production methods are a ""major breakthrough"" that will allow it to reach a sixteenfold increase in 155mm shell manufacturing by the summer.

As a result, it says it will not only be able to meet the UK's demand, but will also begin to supply for export by the end of 2026.

The announcement comes amid ongoing anxiety about the UK's stockpiles of key ammunition, having sent Ukraine half a million artillery rounds as of February this year.

It also appears to address a wider global scramble toward reducing dependence on imports and having homegrown access to critical resources and manufacturing capabilities.

BAE Systems' new approach is twofold, affecting the production of both explosives and propellants for shells.

A new formulation for propellants has been developed, it said, reducing the need for nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin, compounds that are in high demand across multiple industries worldwide.

Meanwhile, RDX explosives — the key explosive in 155mm shells — are to be produced through continuous flow processing, a method that's common in manufacturing but has not yet been applied in defense.

It essentially means that shells are made in an uninterrupted process at smaller scale, rather than in large batches, an approach that, in other industries, has resulted in much greater efficiency.

BAE Systems has until now been reliant on the US and France for its supply of RDX.

Trevor Taylor, director of the Defence, Industries & Society Programme at the Royal United Services Institute, outlined the advantages of the new process.

A small-scale process avoids safety risks associated with a single large production plant, Taylor told BI.

He added that the company's ambition is likely to be ""to control costs at lower production rates, and to be able to surge production levels by operating more hours when needed without a large labor force that would be idle in less pressing times.""

A senior BAE Systems executive with knowledge of the developments told BI that the company plans to sell the technology abroad, promoting other countries' ability to develop sovereign ammunition production.

BAE Systems, like other British defense companies, works in line with the UK Ministry of Defence's priorities and does not sell to the UK's adversaries — meaning that the new system is not likely to end up in Russian hands anytime soon.

The company is the UK's largest defense manufacturer. It won a £2.4 billion ($3.2 billion) government munitions contract in 2020, which was ramped up in 2023 in recognition of the ongoing war in Ukraine.

The company says it's invested £163.5 million, or about $220 million, in new manufacturing sites and tech over the last five years.

Ukrainian drone operators flying their uncrewed aircraft against the threat of Russian jamming are often unsure where their drones actually are, meaning they have to use other guideposts to find their way, an operator told Business Insider.

Directional landmarks can include ""weird-looking buildings"" or intersections. Operators use these when they can't use GPS to locate themselves and can't be sure exactly where their drones are over fields and treelines that look similar, Dimko Zhluktenko, a drone operator with Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces, told BI.

Drones warfare is a major part of Russia's war against Ukraine, and both sides are rapidly creating and developing new types of drones and counter-drone technology. The countermeasures include electronic warfare like jamming, which can target connections between the drone and its operator or the aircraft's GPS navigation system.

GPS, a satellite-based navigation system, is used in munitions, drones, and civilian technology like digital maps. It plays an essential function in military systems and civilian society, but military leaders are increasingly coming to terms with the reality that modern battlefields may be GPS-denied environments.

Weapons that rely on GPS, including sophisticated US weapons, have run into problems on Ukrainian battlefields.

""At the front line, there is literally no GPS,"" Zhluktenko said. ""So a key issue is that when you're flying with no GPS, the drone thinks that he's in one position while, in fact, he's in completely another position.""

Electronic warfare can make location data unreliable, and wind and other factors can knock a drone off course, out of sync with the operator's expectations.

Without GPS, operators have to look at what their drone's camera is showing them and compare it to satellite imagery and maps to figure out where it is.

""And that's why you have to look at the visual markers that you have from the camera: a lake, some weird-looking building, weird intersection, and you just discuss all those markers and use them to navigate through the front line basically.""

""The operator, he's looking at the camera, looking at the map, and figuring out where the drone is and where to go next,"" he said. That's not an easy task, and in some sectors of the front, this can be extremely difficult.

Eastern Ukraine, where most of the fighting is taking place, is very flat and has a largely uniform landscape, making it hard for operators to find those standout features and learn where they are.

Zhluktenko said that in the east of the country, ""one of the key issues is that all of those places, they look exactly the same. It's the same kind of field, the same kind of forest, and there are literally no visual markers to figure out where you're at.""

The flat landscape has also made other parts of warfare more difficult, like tank and armored assaults. Drones can see them coming from far off.

Another Ukrainian drone operator, who spoke to BI on the condition of anonymity, shared similar experiences, explaining that without GPS, drone operators ""have to get oriented using benchmarks."" They said that those can include ""a building or a lake or a river or some house.""

Drones have been used in this war more than in any other war throughout history. From quadcopters to octocopters to large fixed-wing aircraft, drones are running reconnaissance operations, collecting targeting data, dropping bombs, and exploding on targets, and that's just the aerial ones.

These relatively cheap weapons have eliminated assets worth millions of dollars and destroyed targets far from the front. They're radically changing warfare.

And they have been key for Ukraine, which has suffered from shortages of other weaponry. Maj. Gen. Peter Boysen, the commander in chief in Denmark, a significant Ukrainian partner, said this month that attack drones account for more than 70% of Ukrainian kills.

The proliferation of drones means that Russian and Ukrainian industries are in a race to find ways to jam and stop the other country's drones. They are also developing new drones that are resistant to or able to overcome those efforts.

New drone systems include fiber-optic drones, which have a cable between the operator and the drone that prevents them from being jammed, and AI-enabled drones.

AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., two of the biggest wireless carriers in the US, said they won't absorb any forthcoming price hikes on mobile handsets if and when President Donald Trump's global tariffs kick in — and that means customers could pay more for new cell phones. 

Speaking on a call with analysts after presenting first-quarter financial results, AT&T Chief Executive Officer John Stankey said Wednesday the company's strategy would be “taking that cost as we've traditionally done and largely moving it through to the end user.”  Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg said on Tuesday that his company “will not cover any enormous increase on tariffs on handsets. That's ultimately going to hit the consumer in the market.” ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Businesses dealing with the early stages of President Donald Trump's tariffs are looking for ways to pass increasing costs onto consumers, according to a Federal Reserve report Wednesday.

As Trump ordered against-the-board levies on U.S. imports and higher duties on Chinese products, the Fed's Beige Book indicated how they plan to proceed. Companies reported getting notices from suppliers about rising costs, and they looked to find ways not to absorb the increases while noting uncertainty over the ability to pass them along to customers.

""Most Districts noted that firms expected elevated input cost growth resulting from tariffs,"" the report said. ""Many firms have already received notices from suppliers that costs would be increasing.""

Broadly speaking, the report, which comes out about every seven weeks, characterized economic growth as ""little changed"" from the March 5 report, though it noted that ""uncertainty around international trade policy was pervasive across"" the Fed's 12 districts.

Prices generally rose during the period, which included Trump's April 2 ""liberation day"" announcement of the blanket tariffs. Employment was ""little changed"" amid falling headcounts in government jobs.

""Firms reported adding tariff surcharges or shortening pricing horizons to account for uncertain trade policy,"" the report stated. ""Most businesses expected to pass through additional costs to customers. However, there were reports about margin compression amid increased costs, as demand remained tepid in some sectors, especially for consumer-facing firms.""

In the New York area, firms reported rising prices particularly in food and insurance along with construction materials. Manufacturers and distributors said they already are adding surcharges due to shipments.

There also were signs of problems in the trade dispute with Canada. Tourists are booking fewer hotel rooms in New York City and at least one tech firm reported losing business contacts in Canada.

""The outlook for service sector firms worsened noticeably, with contacts anticipating a sharp decline in activity in the coming months. Service sector firms reported a major pullback in planned investment,"" the report said.

The report also noted the impact that the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency has had on employment in the Washington, D.C. region. DOGE has sought to pare back the federal workforce, laying off thousands and offering buyouts to others.

While the employment picture overall was ""unchanged"" for the period, ""many federal government workers were laid off or put on administrative leave in recent weeks.""

""These cuts to the federal workforce have impacted businesses throughout the entire district. In addition, federal contractors have laid off workers in response to spending cuts. For example, a research organization headquartered outside the DC-region laid off workers due to contracts being cancelled. Similarly, a Northern Virginia consultancy reduced headcount by 25 percent due to losing half their contracts,"" the report added.

Elsewhere in the report, service organizations dependent on government support noted difficulties since the White House began culling through agencies that get federal aid. The report specifically cited food banks in New York as seeing cuts in programs and personnel.

""Contacts at non-profits and other community-based organizations expressed significant concern about the future of federal funding and services support, creating challenges in staffing, strategy, and planning,"" the report said.

Firing Science Advisors Will Leave the U.S. Senseless

From public health to space exploration, advisory panels have helped U.S. agencies make smarter decisions. The Trump administration wants to kill them

In the Trump administration's ongoing race to make the U.S. poorer, sicker and dumber, one more stomp on the accelerator comes from cuts aimed against its federal advisory committees. Whether infectious diseases or space exploration, these panels of experts are the unpaid brains behind the brawn of the U.S. government.

With its signature disdain for anything smacking of smarts or competence, the Trump administration now aims to destroy or neutralize them. In a February 19 executive order, Donald Trump directed his staff to compile a list of “Federal Advisory Committees that should be terminated on grounds that they are unnecessary.” The order directly terminated the HHS Advisory Committee on Long COVID (a syndrome afflicting 23 million people in the U.S. right now) and the Health Equity Advisory Committee, which sought to help underserved people access care like blood pressure medication or postpartum treatment, through Medicare and Medicaid. Since then NOAA has closed several of its advisory panels, NSF closed a dozen, NASA has consolidated its wildly disparate astrophysics, biological and physical sciences, Earth science, heliophysics and planetary sciences panels into one body, and the U.S. Geological Survey closed its new scientific integrity body, alongside five others at the Department of Interior that included a climate adaptation panel. “This means that you, the public, will be more at-risk of being harmed because the scientific integrity and misconduct issues that were prevalent before will continue to persist,” wrote integrity panel member Jacob Carter. He called the committee's cancellation, “an indicator that this administration has no intention to uphold scientific evidence in its decisions.”

He's right; contrary to the executive order, these committees matter. Cutting away advisory panels hurts everyone and leaves the U.S. government uninformed when making critical decisions that affect millions of lives, alongside a public left in the dark about what advice agencies do receive. These advisors, a “fifth arm of the government,” have long served as a thorn in the side of polluters and lobbyists, putting them under siege for decades, and doubtless in the gunsights of the giddily for-sale Trump administration. A 2021 Ecology Law Quarterly review found past end runs around advisory committees were linked to lead pollution, fracking contamination of drinking water, and worse air quality.

Federal advisory committees operate under a 1972 law, which governs the roughly 1,000 expert committees advising federal agencies on evidence-based practices on issues like boating safety or railroad retirement benefits at a yearly cost of $400 million. The panels are a bargain, providing by law “fairly balanced” expert advice that includes disclosures of financial conflicts of interest, and providing information openly to the public. The best-known examples from the pandemic were those FDA and CDC panels that voted on the safety and rollout of COVID vaccines to much attention.

History repeats when it comes to attacks on advisory panels. In 2019 Trump ordered a one-third cut in the number of them. The order took aim at science panels at NASA, the NSF and the Energy Department, in particular. The first Trump administration's sheer incompetence kept many of those kinds of closures at bay. His then EPA chief resorted to stuffing a clean air panel with industry stooges instead, and an antiabortion advocates panel lacking any scientific credibility was whipped up to eliminate fetal tissue research at NIH.

Now, however, the crush of executive orders and disregard for Congress seen in the first 100 days of the new regime make things look even more dire. The dangerous, unqualified HHS chief Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., has forced out top FDA vaccine official Peter Marks, who oversaw the vaccine panel that held steadily to public health principles during the pandemic, refusing to bend to Trump's demand for an “October Surprise” vaccine to save himself in the 2020 election. All Department of Homeland Security advisory committees members were fired in January, halting a probe into a massive Chinese breach of U.S. telecommunications infrastructure.

Perhaps the clearest sign of the scientific advice we can instead expect from the Trump administration comes from RFK, Jr., naming an unqualified antivaccine activist, one who in 2011 was disciplined for practicing medicine without a license, to head a phony study to make autism “preventable” by September. The cruelty of his dishonest sham, founded on disdain for the autistic community and aimed at parents of autistic children, defies decency. It seems squarely aimed at making kids sick by discouraging vaccination.

In the first Trump administration, his appointees also skirted the law requiring keeping advisory meetings open to the public. Such secrecy will be indubitably ubiquitous amid the news administration's “completely insane” meetings held on Signal, and tariff decisions surrounded by suspected insider trading. In our unhinged current moment, it's hard to recall that Trump campaign bankroller Elon Musk quit a Trump presidential advisory committee in 2017 over the withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. So much for the scruples that drove him then. Now he (wink-wink) doesn't really run the run-amok DOGE staffers stealing data, jobs and buildingsin secrecy across the nation's capital. In acting as an advisor but not an appointee, he is a one-man circumvention of openness.

One of the trials of the Trump era is that its malignancy comes packaged in a cloud of buffoonery: take your pick from Musk waving a chainsaw around on stage or an education secretary calling artificial intelligence “Ay-One” or any of Trump's inane digressions that should have triggered the 25th Amendment in his first term.

But his administration's steps, large and small, from attacking universities to immigrants to expert advisors, aimed at destroying competence and honesty as guiding principles for the U.S., will in the end yield only tears, not laughter. Wrecking the federal advisory committee system is just one more tread on a path to American ruin.

In Frank Baum's original novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the Emerald City is said to be such a brilliant shade of green that visitors must wear green-tinted glasses to protect their eyes from ""the brightness and glory"" of the city.

The glasses are one of the wizard's many deceits; the city viewed through green-tinted glasses would, of course, only look more green.

But using a new technique called ""Oz,"" scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, have found a way to manipulate the human eye into seeing a brand-new color -- a blue-green color of unparalleled saturation that the research team has named ""olo.""

""It was like a profoundly saturated teal … the most saturated natural color was just pale by comparison,"" said Austin Roorda, a professor of optometry and vision science at UC Berkeley's Herbert Wertheim School of Optometry & Vision Science, and one of the creators of Oz.

Oz works by using tiny doses of laser light to individually control up to 1,000 photoreceptors in the eye at one time. Using Oz, the team is able to show people not only a green more stunning than anything in nature, but also other colors, lines, moving dots and images of babies and fish.

The platform could also be used to answer basic questions about human sight and vision loss.

""We chose Oz to be the name because it was like we were going on a journey to the land of Oz to see this brilliant color that we'd never seen before,"" said James Carl Fong, a doctoral student in electrical engineering and computer sciences (EECS) at UC Berkeley.

""We've created a system that can track, target and stimulate photoreceptor cells with such high precision that we can now answer very basic, but also very thought-provoking, questions about the nature of human color vision,"" Fong said. ""It gives us a way to study the human retina at a new scale that has never been possible in practice.""

The Oz technique is described in a new study published last week in the journal Science Advances. The work was funded in part by federal grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.

Untapped photoreceptors

Humans are able to see in color thanks to three different types of photoreceptor ""cone"" cells embedded in the retina. Each type of cone is sensitive to different wavelengths of light: S cones detect shorter, bluer wavelengths;, M cones detect medium, greenish wavelengths; and L cones detect longer, reddish wavelengths.

However, due to an evolutionary quirk, the light wavelengths that activate the M and L cones are almost entirely overlapping. This means that 85% of the light that activates M cones also activates L cones.

""There's no wavelength in the world that can stimulate only the M cone,"" said study senior author Ren Ng, a professor of EECS at UC Berkeley, ""I began wondering what it would look like if you could just stimulate all the M cone cells. Would it be like the greenest green you've ever seen?""

To find out, Ng teamed up with Roorda, who had created a technology that used tiny microdoses of laser light to target and activate individual photoreceptors. Roorda calls the technology ""a microscope for looking at the retina,"" and it is already being used by ophthalmologists to study eye disease.

But for a human to actually perceive a whole new color, Ng and Roorda would need to find a way to activate not just one cone cell, but thousands of them.

A movie screen the size of a fingernail

Fong first started working on the Oz project in 2018 as an undergraduate engineering student, and has created much of the complex software needed to translate images and colors into thousands of tiny laser pulses directed at the human retina.

""I joined after meeting this other student who was working with Ren, who told me that they were shooting lasers into people's eyes to make them see impossible colors,'"" Fong said.

For Oz to work, first you need a map of the unique arrangement of the S, M and L cone cells on an individual's retina. To get these maps, the researchers collaborated with Ramkumar Sabesan and Vimal Prahbhu Pandiyan at the University of Washington, who have developed an optical system that can image the human retina and identify each cone cell.

With an individual's cone map in hand, the Oz system can be programmed to rapidly scan a laser beam over a small patch of the retina, delivering tiny pulses of energy when the beam reaches a cone that it wants to activate, and otherwise staying off.

The laser beam is just one color -- the same hue as a green laser pointer -- but by activating a combination of S, M and L cone cells, it can trick the eye into seeing images in full technicolor. Or, by primarily activating the M cone cells, Oz can show people the color olo.

""If you look at your index fingernail at arm's length, that's about the size of the display,"" said Roorda. ""But if we could, we would have filled the entire visual space like an IMAX.""

The 'wow' experience

Hannah Doyle, a doctoral student in EECS and co-lead author of the paper, designed and ran the human experiments with Oz. Five human subjects got the chance to see the color olo, including Roorda and Ng, who were aware of the purpose of the study, but not the specifics of what they would see.

In one experiment, Doyle asked the participants to compare olo to other colors. They described it as blue-green or peacock green, and reported that it was much more saturated than the nearest monochromatic color.

""The most saturated colors you can experience in nature are the monochromatic ones. Light from a green laser pointer is one example,"" Roorda said. ""When I pinned olo up against other monochromatic light, I really had that 'wow' experience.""

Doyle also tried ""jittering"" the Oz laser, directing it ever-so-slightly off target so the light pulses hit random cones rather than only M cones. The participants immediately stopped seeing olo and started seeing the regular green of the laser.

""I wasn't a subject for this paper, but I've seen olo since, and it's very striking. You know you're looking at something very blue-green,"" Doyle said. ""When the laser gets jittered, the normal color of the laser almost looks like yellow because the difference is so stark.""

Probing the nature of color vision

Oz isn't just useful for projecting tiny movies into the eye. The research team is already finding ways to use the technique to study eye disease and vision loss.

""Many diseases that cause visual impairment involve lost cone cells,"" Doyle said. ""One application that I'm exploring now is to use this cone by cone activation to simulate cone loss in healthy subjects.""

They are also exploring whether Oz could help people with color blindness to see all the colors of the rainbow, or if the technique could be used to allow humans to see in tetrachromatic color, as if they had four sets of cone cells.

It may also help answer more fundamental questions about how the brain makes sense of the complex world around us.

""We found that we can recreate a normal visual experience just by manipulating the cells -- not by casting an image, but just by stimulating the photoreceptors. And we found that we can also expand that visual experience, which we did with olo,"" Roorda said. ""It's still a mystery whether, if you expand the signals or generate new sensory inputs, will the brain be able to make sense of them and appreciate them? And, you know, I like to believe that it can. I think that the human brain is this really remarkable organ that does a great job of making sense of inputs, existing or even new.""

Epigenetic reprogramming refers to the deliberate modification of epigenetic marks that govern gene expression to reset a cell's biological age or identity. Unlike mutations or changes in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence, epigenetic modifications are reversible, making them attractive targets for age-related therapeutic interventions.1,2

In recent years, the potential to reverse aging through such reprogramming has galvanized research in regenerative medicine and longevity science. Central to this progress is the hypothesis that the loss or distortion of epigenetic information at least partly drives cellular aging.1,2

In this article, we examine the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying epigenetic reprogramming, how it may influence aging, and the extent to which it could enable cellular rejuvenation. We also analyze key studies, ethical and technical challenges, and the growing commercial interest in age reversal therapies.

Can Neuroplasticity Be Hacked? Exploring the Limits

Epigenetic reprogramming involves the reset of epigenetic markers, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, to a more youthful state. The concept gained scientific interest and traction following the Nobel-prize-winning discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by Takahashi and Yamanaka, who demonstrated that somatic cells could be reprogrammed into pluripotent cells using four transcription factors, namely Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc, together known as OSKM factors.3

This process not only resets cellular identity but also reverses age-associated epigenetic markers. The key mechanisms involved in reprogramming included:

DNA methylation: The addition of methyl groups to specific DNA sequences containing a linear repeat of cytosine and guanine nucleotides (CpG dinucleotides). DNA methylation is predominantly involved in the silencing of gene expression.1

Histone modification: Post-translational changes to the histone proteins that help package DNA into chromosomes. These changes include methylation and acetylation, which influence chromatin structure and gene accessibility.1

Chromatin remodeling: Changes in nucleosome positioning that significantly alter chromatin structure, regulating the accessibility of transcription factors to the DNA.1

Aging is accompanied by progressive epigenetic drift — a divergence from the original epigenomic configuration of a young cell. This includes aberrant DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling, which cumulatively lead to dysregulated gene expression, impaired cellular function, and age-related phenotypes and diseases.4,5

Studies in yeast, mice, and humans indicate that such changes are not merely correlative but play a causal role in aging. For instance, in monozygotic twins, epigenetic profiles become increasingly dissimilar with age despite identical genetic backgrounds.5 Similarly, interventions such as calorie restriction that extend lifespan are known to influence epigenetic states.

Scientists have leveraged this knowledge of the predictable accumulation of DNA methylation tags to develop tools like the epigenetic clock — a biological age estimator.6

One of the most prominent versions, Horvath's clock, developed by Steve Horvath in 2013, uses these methylation patterns across multiple tissues to calculate a person's biological age with remarkable accuracy.7

Groundbreaking experiments have shown that epigenetic reprogramming can restore youthful characteristics to aged tissues. A pivotal early study from the laboratory headed by Dr. Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, who is currently the director of Altos Lab's San Diego Institute of Science, further demonstrated that cyclic expression of the Yamanaka factors (OSKM) in a mouse model exhibiting accelerated aging could extend lifespan and ameliorate aging-associated hallmarks without inducing pluripotency.8

By intermittently activating OSKM factors, the researchers avoided the risks of tumorigenesis typically associated with continuous reprogramming. The treated mice showed improved muscle regeneration, enhanced pancreatic function, and more youthful epigenetic profiles, suggesting that partial reprogramming may be a viable strategy for systemic age reversal.8

Another study in 2020 conducted by a research team from Harvard Medical School demonstrated that expression of the Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 (OSK factors) in mouse retinal ganglion cells reversed age-associated DNA methylation and improved visual function.

The intervention required the TET (ten-eleven translocation) enzymes TET1 and TET2 DNA demethylases, which suggested the role of active DNA methylation remodeling in rejuvenation.6

Similarly, the cyclic expression of OSKM in another mouse model of progeria or accelerated aging improved tissue function and extended lifespan, supporting the feasibility of in vivo partial reprogramming.9

Recent advances also include chemically induced reprogramming. Another research team from Harvard Medical School identified six chemical cocktails, consisting of combinations of small molecules such as valproic acid, forskolin, and tranylcypromine, that were capable of reversing transcriptomic aging in human cells without genetic manipulation, marking a significant step toward clinical translation.1

Your Biological Age vs. Chronological Age: Why It Matters

Despite its promise, epigenetic reprogramming faces substantial hurdles. One of the foremost concerns is the oncogenic risk associated with full reprogramming. Maintaining somatic cell identity while inducing rejuvenation is a critical issue.

The overexpression of OSKM factors risks dedifferentiation or partial reversion to a pluripotent state, which may trigger tumorigenesis or disrupt tissue function.8

Epigenetic determinism, or the concept that the expression of traits and behaviors is determined by epigenetic mechanisms and not the DNA sequence alone, also raises ethical concerns.

The notion that life experiences can imprint heritable changes challenges concepts of personal autonomy and complicates privacy protections. There are further concerns about equitable access, especially if reprogramming therapies are commercialized before regulatory standards are established.10

From a technical perspective, challenges include the development of safe and efficient delivery systems for reprogramming factors, particularly in vivo, where viral vectors can pose integration risks and immune reactions.

Non-integrative systems such as messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), proteins, and nanoparticles are under exploration but require further optimization for stability and tissue-specific targeting.9,11

Other technical challenges include the need for reliable biomarkers to monitor reprogramming efficacy in real time and the potential off-target effects of reprogramming cocktails, especially in heterogeneous tissues with varying epigenetic signatures.1,5,12

Is Cellular Senescence the Real Cause of Aging?

The biotech sector has rapidly mobilized to explore the potential of epigenetic reprogramming. Companies such as Altos Labs, Rejuvenate Bio, and Life Biosciences are investing heavily in platforms aimed at extending health span and reversing age-related damage through gene therapy, small molecules, and synthetic biology.11,13

While most interventions remain in preclinical stages, venture capital investment and pharmaceutical partnerships are accelerating development. For instance, Rejuvenate Bio has initiated proof-of-concept studies for OSK-mediated reprogramming in cardiovascular disease models.13

Additionally, Altos Labs has invested substantial resources into building research hubs to investigate safe partial reprogramming protocols. However, the regulatory frameworks currently lag behind the pace of innovation, posing a bottleneck to clinical adoption.10

Epigenetic therapy is poised to become a cornerstone of precision medicine. The current trends indicate that advances in single-cell epigenomics, machine learning, and synthetic biology will enable more precise control of the epigenome.

The focus areas of future research include non-integrative delivery systems, such as mRNA, proteins, and nanoparticles, that can avoid genomic alterations and targeted partial reprogramming to specific tissues or organs.12

The identification and use of aging biomarkers to personalize interventions, as well as combination therapies that pair epigenetic modulators with anti-inflammatory drugs and senolytics that eliminate cells associated with tissue damage, are other promising areas of epigenetic therapy.

Moreover, ongoing research into small-molecule epigenetic modulators may yield scalable, non-invasive interventions.12

However, the road to clinical translation is complex and marked by numerous ethical and technical challenges. Nonetheless, the pace of scientific discovery in the field of epigenetics and the substantial commercial investment indicate that epigenetic therapies may soon enter the therapeutic landscape.

The ability to safely and effectively manipulate the epigenome brings considerable hope to the future of longevity science.

Editor's Note: USWNT Footnotes takes you inside the major talking points around the U.S. women's national team, the NWSL, European leagues, and all across American women's soccer.

The biggest news from the weekend was in regard to Trinity Rodman's decision to step away from the Washington Spirit to address ongoing back issues. The star forward has been dealing with back spasms for years, and last September had to be taken off the field in a wheelchair during a Washington Spirit match vs. the Kansas City Current. 

In March, Rodman told reporters that she didn't think her back ""will ever be 100 percent.""

""It's kind of an issue of it's not one specific thing, it's just the way that my back is structured,"" Rodman said. ""And it's more so management than like a curable fix.""

She admitted she didn't think her back ""will be the way it was my rookie year, which is unfortunate.""

A few days later, Rodman joined the USWNT for the first time since helping lead the squad to a gold medal at last summer's Paris Olympics. The 22-year-old scored a brilliant goal in a 2-0 victory over Brazil, and celebrated by poking a little fun at her back (which nearly made the medical staff rush into panic mode). 

Rodman didn't see the pitch in the Americans' second match of the window, but played 45 minutes for the Spirit in a 2-0 win over Racing Louisville on April 12.

According to The Washington Post, which was first to report the news, Rodman is meeting with a doctor in London and there is currently no timetable for her return. The USWNT will convene for its next camp at the end of May.

Lindsey Heaps' Lyon wins first leg of Champions League semifinal

USWNT captain Lindsey Heaps' Lyon defeated Emily Fox and Jenna Nighswonger's Arsenal 2-1 in the first leg of the Women's Champions League semifinal on Saturday. Heaps joked ahead of the match that she was giving Fox ""as much crap as I possibly could and just chip at her a little bit"" during the last USWNT camp.

Heaps, who has been vocal throughout her career about her passion for playing club soccer in Europe and specifically in Champions League, has been thrilled to see more of her U.S. teammates make their way overseas. Fox signed with Arsenal last year, Nighswonger joined the club earlier this year, and Naomi Girma made headlines following a historic transfer from the San Diego Wave to Chelsea in January. Catarina Macario and Mia Fishel also play for the Blues.

""I think that's really special for me to see as a captain,"" Heaps told reporters ahead of Saturday's game. ""I want all my players to be doing well. So just not this weekend, I hope.""

Lyon and Arsenal will meet again for the second leg on Sunday, April 27.

Girma makes Champions League debut

USWNT star defender Naomi Girma has finally returned from injury. On Sunday, Girma subbed on for Chelsea in the 81st minute of the club's ultimate 4-1 loss to Barcelona in the first leg of their Champions League semifinal match. Girma came on the pitch with the Blues only down 2-1, but Irene Paredes and Claudia Pina scored twice more in the final moments. 

Chelsea will get a chance at revenge at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.

This hasn't been an ideal start to Girma's European soccer career, especially after becoming the first million-dollar transfer in women's soccer history. The 24-year-old defender has been recovering from a calf injury, which has limited her minutes for Chelsea and appearances for the USWNT. She only played in one regular season WSL match in March before earning her first Champions League minutes over the weekend. 

Ally Sentnor converts game-winning PK

Back stateside, rising USWNT star Ally Sentnor converted a penalty kick in the 10th minute of stoppage time to give the Utah Royals a 1-0 win over the Chicago Red Stars. It was the Royals first win of this NWSL season.

The 21-year-old Sentnor, who was named U.S. Soccer's Young Female Player of the Year in 2024, calmly stepped up to the spot and nailed her shot past former USWNT goalkeeper Alyssa Naher for the victory.

The 1-0 result was also the first shutout of the season for Utah goalkeeper Mandy McGlynn, who has been called into recent USWNT camps and is in contention to fill the starting goalkeeper vacancy left by Naeher.
