                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Club World Cup will soon be in Atlanta. A combination of ticket prices, event fatigue, unfamiliarity and anticipation are some of the reasons soccer supporters in Atlanta said they aren't overly excited about attending this summer's Club World Cup matches at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The city is scheduled to host six matches in the tournament, starting with a group-stage match June 16 and finishing with a quarterfinal July 5. But potentially getting to watch Erling Haaland or Cole Palmer or Lionel Messi, who should be here with Inter Miami, has a price. “Don't really care to see any of the teams playing for those prices,” Jordan Comer posted on X. “Also, saving money for the real thing next summer!” Atlanta and Mercedes-Benz Stadium are scheduled to host eight matches in that tournament. That may be why FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who was in town last week to promote the Club World Cup, reminded people that tickets are still available. “So much sports, and tournaments ran throughout the year that it feels like overkill,” Juan Alonso, who lives in South Georgia, posted on X. “Going to a few games,” Smyrna's Adam Dittmer posted on X. “I think it will be an experience, but it lacks some meaning if you are not a fan of the clubs. Not understanding the difference between the Club World Cup and World Cup is a hurdle for casual sports fans. The Club World Cup is a tournament for teams that play in leagues, such as Manchester City in the Premier League. Some of the players who will compete for their clubs in this summer's Club World Cup will compete for their national teams in next summer's World Cup. Next year's host nations are the U.S., Canada and Mexico. FIFA, which declined to provide ticket sales totals, said people from more than 130 countries have purchased tickets for tournament matches. Former Atlanta United Vice President Carlos Bocanegra, speaking Wednesday in interviews set up by FIFA and focused on the Club World Cup, said the soccer that people could see at this summer's tournament may be better than what they may see in next summer's World Cup. Unlike when playing for a national team, when players have just a few days to learn each other and work on what the manager wants, the club teams have been playing together and working with the manager for months to years. “The football could be a little bit more fluid,” he said. “If people don't know about the Flamengoes of the world or Palmeiras or Boca Juniors or River Plate, they're really going to see how big of a following that those teams have when they show up to the stadium and watch these teams play,” he said. “They are iconic teams and have massive following, not only in their home country, but here in the United States because we have so many expats from all over the world. So I do think that's going to be a pretty cool experience, and just a big party for these people to enjoy watching their teams play and competing against the best of the best.” Former Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger on Wednesday said that those who do watch the Club World Cup may get a chance to see not only the bona fide stars such as Real Madrid's Vinicius, but also players who are unknowns now but can become world-class. “It's a unique opportunity for players who don't go to the World Cup because we have about 87 or 90 different countries who will be represented by players who do not go to the World Cup and can win the (Club) World Cup.” Stay up to date every day on breaking news, in-depth investigations, politics, sports, entertainment, food and dining and so much more by becoming a subscriber to the AJC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's North America's biennial international tournament that will serve as the USMNT's last competitive preparation for the 2026 World Cup, which will be played in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino recently talked with U. S. Soccer about how he's preparing for Gold Cup. Only two of those teams will move on to the knockout stage — and while the USMNT is widely expected to be one of them, Pochettino isn't taking anything for granted. "It's important that we respect all of our opponents in the competition," he said. "The Gold Cup is historically always a difficult competition." Trinidad and Tobago eliminated the USMNT from World Cup contention in 2017, Saudi Arabia beat eventual champion Argentina in the group stage of the 2022 World Cup and Haiti is unbeaten in its last 10 fixtures. They're all capable of delivering upsets and surprises. For Pochettino, competitiveness isn't just about on-field talent. "We need to be intelligent in the way that we are going to select the players and not just choose based on talent alone." In practice, that means up-and-coming, high-energy players might get Gold Cup minutes over traditional USMNT starters. Keep an eye on big-hearted characters such as Real Salt Lake's Diego Luna, Olympique Lyonnais' Tanner Tessman and the Vancouver Whitecaps' Brian White. They might play a bigger role in the Gold Cup than previously expected. He has a grip on the global USMNT playing pool, but his takes on it might be controversial It has taken time, but Pochettino and his team appear to have a good handle on where the best American soccer players are around the globe, from Milan to Monterrey and everywhere in between. "For sure we have a better picture," he said of the USMNT landscape. "Since we took over the project we wanted to identify and scout as many players as possible, both in MLS and those playing abroad." Pochettino's recent lineups have taught us plenty about what that picture looks like. He's more positive about Major League Soccer and its players than many predicted he would be, but he's less high on the English Championship and Liga MX than his predecessors. He has passed over Middlesbrough's Aidan Morris, Coventry City's Haji Wright and Club America's Alex Zendejas in recent windows. "For sure to start we must compete hard," Pochettino said of the tournament. "We must match the intensity of our opponents, because in these tournaments, they are always motivated to play against the USA." But what does Pochettino mean when he says "intensity"? Pochettino is tight-lipped about how he defines and measures it for his players. But whatever intensity means to Pochettino, the USMNT hasn't provided it yet. The USMNT will return to action in early June with friendly matches against Turkey and Switzerland. It will open its Gold Cup campaign on June 15 against Trinidad and Tobago in San Jose, California.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Guardian can reveal that as part of a cross-promotional deal finalised this week, 23 of the 63 matches will be shown on Channel 5 as well as on Dazn – 15 group games, four last-16 ties, two quarter-finals, one semi-final and the final. The remaining 40 games will be shown exclusively by Dazn, which has committed to making every match in the new expanded tournament available free-to-air globally via its app. The Club World Cup, which includes Chelsea and Manchester City, will be the highest-profile sports event televised by Channel 5, which has held live rights to the Europa League and numerous highlights packages. Channel 5 is also in talks with the England and Wales Cricket Board about buying two men's and two women's England T20 matches this summer as it seeks to expand its sports coverage. It is owned by the American film giant Paramount. Dazn paid $1bn (£787m) for global Club World Cup rights in February in a surprise deal that appears to have been largely funded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, with the kingdom's Surj Sports Investment group last month confirming it had taken a minority stake in the streaming company valued at $1bn. The Dazn/Surj partnership spared Fifa's blushes after a lengthy TV rights sales process which had concluded with it failing to find rights partners. Although Dazn's latest accounts say it has 300 million monthly users globally, it remains a challenger company in certain markets, including the UK, which led to an agreement to sublicense the rights to ensure larger viewing figures for Fifa and its commercial partners. Warner Bros has a sublicensing deal in the United States. The Guardian reported this month that the BBC and ITV had opted not to bid because their main football focus will be their joint coverage of England's defence of the Women's European Championship. Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich and Lionel Messi's Inter Miami are among the participants in the competition, which runs from 14 June to 13 July.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>United States men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino has made it clear that mental fortitude will be a major factor in his player selection for the upcoming Gold Cup, where the team will face Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia, and Haiti in group stage competition. In an interview released Tuesday by the U.S. Soccer Federation, Pochettino stressed that talent alone would not guarantee players a spot on the roster as he looks to rebuild following disappointing performances in the recent Nations League Finals. "We need to be intelligent in the way that we are going to select the players and not just choose based on talent alone. Following those losses, Pochettino publicly criticized his team's competitive spirit and effort levels, concerns he continues to emphasize ahead of the Gold Cup competition. "For sure to start we must compete hard," Pochettino explained. "We must match the intensity of our opponents, because in these tournaments they are always motivated to play against the USA." Pochettino previously drew comparisons to Argentina's mentality in discussions with ESPN, suggesting the world champions' warrior mindset as a model for his American squad: "They [Argentina] go to war and to defend your badge, your flag, and that is what we need to create." Before the Gold Cup tournament begins, the USMNT will return to action with two international friendlies, hosting Turkey on June 7 and Switzerland on June 10, providing Pochettino additional opportunities to evaluate potential squad members. "It's not just about showing up in your home country and trying to play nice soccer. No, you must be proud, you must fight for the people that would love to be in your position, for the millions of kids that are going to see us and dream to be one day where we are," Pochettino emphasized. "This is the type of responsibility and commitment we need to show in a different way than we did in Los Angeles."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Is the PL too predictable? The Club World Cup will be broadcast on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom following a sublicensing deal with DAZN, the global rights holder for the tournament. The free-to-air channel will show 23 of the newly-expanded tournament's 63 matches live: 15 group games, four last-16 matches, two quarter-final games, one semi-final and the final. All 63 matches will be broadcast for free on the online platform of DAZN, who struck a deal worth $1billion (£750million) deal with FIFA in December for the global rights. Premier League clubs Manchester City and Chelsea will be involved in the 32-team tournament, alongside Real Madrid, Inter, Juventus, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain. World football's governing body had been in talks with Apple over a global streaming deal to broadcast the tournament, but those negotiations fell through in July 2024. Channel 5 is owned by Paramount Global, whose president of international ad sales Lee Sears described the competition as “one of the sporting events of the summer” with matches played “in peak evening time” in the UK. DAZN's CEO Shay Segev added “the Club World Cup will bring unparalleled engagement opportunities”. The Club World Cup begins on June 14 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami and will run until July 13, with the final taking place at MetLife Stadium in New York. Channel 5 was most widely known among football fans for showing UEFA Cup matches from the channel's inception in 1997 until 2012, when it lost the rights to free-to-air commercial rival ITV Sport.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>KSHB 41 reporter Tod Palmer covers sports business and eastern Jackson County. There's a buzz in the air around Kansas City about FIFA World Cup 26, including at Westport Tattoo. “To have something like that come to Kansas City, with being a big soccer fan all my life and all those world teams coming here, it's just great," said soccer fan Gabe Wilkerson. Wilkerson — who was getting work done on his right-arm sleeve Tuesday afternoon at Westport Tattoo, 1509 Westport Road in Kansas City, Missouri — wants to take his family to at least one of the six games GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium will host during next summer's World Cup. “Tickets for the FIFA World Cup 2026™ will be sold exclusively via FIFA.com/tickets, with general sales expected to begin in late 2025,” KC2026 CEO Pam Kramer said. “These tickets, which will be available to the general public, differ from the premium tickets currently being sold for FIFA's hospitality deposit program, On Location.” “It definitely seems like a lot of those bigger sporting events are pretty expensive,” said Westport Tattoo owner Tim Johnson. Johnson is also a soccer enthusiast and hopes his family gets to experience the World Cup in person next year. “I told my son about it, and he wants to go as well.” It seems like everyone wants to check out what all the fuss is about. “It would just be cool to go see the experience, get to meet people from all over the place and all that kind of stuff.” As a kid, Clark played goalkeeper, and her family has always loved soccer. She remembers attending Wizards games at Arrowhead in front of sparse crowds. “I would imagine we're gonna have a few more people involved and a few more excited fans than we did back in the '90s,” Clark said. “For the average Joe, I would imagine that's not within reach,” Clark said. Johnson said he's paid as much as $800 for floor seats to a UFC fight before, but he's worried about the dent four tickets in that price range might put in his budget. “If it's a big event — like a life event, where you may not be able to do it again — $200 to $500-ish wouldn't be out of the range per ticket,” Johnson said. Fans seeking priority access to World Cup ticket-included hospitality experiences can place a deposit with On Location. Fans can sign up for email updates at the FIFA ticketing website.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The FIFA Club World Cup is an international men's association football competition organised by the sport's global governing body that pits the best teams from every continent against one another. FIFA have rejigged the whole competition so instead of just seven participants and a straight knockout, where European and South American sides entered in the semi-finals, this format mirrors that of the World Cup. 32 teams will take part, with 12 of those being from Europe. It's the same qualification format for teams across other continents too, with victory in the Copa Libertadores, Asian Champions League, African Champions League and CONCACAF Champions League clinching a place in the CWC. The 32 teams will be split into eight groups of four, and after a round robin, two sides from each group progress to the knockout stages. Games will take place across 12 stadiums in 11 cities featuring Philadelphia, Atlanta, Miami, Orlando and East Rutherford. The tournament takes place from June 15th until July 13th, with the first game seeing 'host' team Inter Miami face Egyptian side Al Ahly in Miami. The 2025 Club World Cup winners will take home a huge £97m from FIFA. A prize pot of £774m is to be shared between the 32 sides. £406m of that will be shared according to sporting and commercial criteria, and the rest distributed based on sporting performance. 32 teams have qualified for the tournament, split by confederation: However, at the time of writing only 31 teams have been confirmed after Mexican side Club Leon were removed from the Club World Cup after failing to meet criteria on multi-club ownership, with both they and CF Pachuca owned by the same corporation. The aforementioned Chelsea qualified thanks to their Champions League win in 20/21, and they join reigning Club World Cup champions Manchester City as the only two English sides to participate. Reigning CWC champions Manchester City follow ahead of Bayern Munich, before a big drop to Chelsea, Inter, PSG and Atletico Madrid. Hosts Inter Miami, led by Lionel Messi, are 33/1. The opening match will be staged in Munich on June 14 between Germany and Scotland.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, the most recent information suggests that this will not be the case and that there will be a substitute in the meantime. Everything points to the fact that, unlike what some believe, someone completely new will not arrive but Santiago Solari. This, from the board's point of view, is the most natural situation they can see today at least for the moment. That said, this may be subject to a radical change if the new coach wants to get involved very early. Only in this case would Solari's position be taken over by this new coach, but for now, it is the decision made by the board. His performance was not the most optimal, but he left great things like the incorporation of Vinicius and Valverde into the first team. A decision which for many is wrong, but today, without having a new coach signed, it is the most optimal. For now, the only thing we can do is wait and see if the information about Ancelotti's departure after that Copa del Rey final really comes true. Only then will we be able to see what the board's move will be and if this is really the path to follow. However, before this, it seems very complicated to determine what the higher-ups are thinking.</p>
