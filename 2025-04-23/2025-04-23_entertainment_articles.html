                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Joanna Gaines is plotting for you to do the easy work in your next home renovation. Magnolia Network has dropped a new trailer for Gaines' show “Mini Reni” that aims to feature smaller renovations that pretty much any homeowner can do. “It doesn't have to be a dramatic renovation. It can literally be simple little details,” Gaines says. “The hope is that we can inspire you to tackle your own mini reni.” As we reported recently, “Mini Reni” is Gaines' solo outing that will feature the host as she “takes on a series of ‘mini' projects with quick timelines. In each episode, she makes a few intentional, creative additions to transform smaller spaces with big impact.” “This is where I can feel a bit more freedom to try new ideas,” she adds. “And end with these fresh finished spaces that didn't require months of work.” Gaines' popular renovation series, “Fixer Upper,” with husband Chip – as well as other shows of the same ilk – would see projects take anywhere from three to eight months to complete. There's also what appear to be his and her home offices in another featured space. “But you're not spending too much to make a pretty cool impact.” One commented on Instagram “Small changes with a big impact are so cool!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Irish rap group Kneecap have never shied away from politics, and their recent sets at Coachella sparked controversy after they included messages defending Palestine during their performances on both weekends. In an email to Rolling Stone, band member Mo Chara explained that Kneecap have spoken about Palestine “at every single gig since the band's formation, long before October 2023 as the oppression and brutal occupation of Palestine has been ongoing for 77 years,” and responded to some of the criticism that's followed. During its first Coachella performance, the band had planned to have several projections with pro-Palestine text on them. However, these didn't make it onstage, and the set was cut short on Coachella's YouTube livestream. “This is something that happens at all of our gigs from Spain to Scotland and Ireland to Iceland because people know what's happening is wrong and are angry about it,” Mo Chara writes. “They have obliterated much of the Gaza Strip with U.S.-supplied weapons and are currently starving over 2 million Gazans. People can make their own decisions about whether our message is anti-Israel, but for us, it's about their government's sickening actions, not ordinary people.”) On X, Sharon Osbourne urged people to advocate for revoking band members' visas, saying that their projections displayed “anti-Israel messages and hate speech” and that they “openly support terrorist organizations.” Asked about Osbourne's tweets, Mo Chara responded, “Her rant has so many holes in it that it hardly warrants a reply, but she should listen to ‘War Pigs' that was written by Black Sabbath (her husband).” Trump Is Now Screwing Over Republicans in Need of Disaster Relief Suge Knight's Wrongful-Death Retrial Officially Ran Off the Rails Today Warren Warns of ‘Backdoor Way' Trump and Musk Want to Gut Social Security Trump Attacks the Supreme Court, Says America ‘Cannot Give Everyone a Trial' Mo Chara didn't respond to questions about whether they'd accept that offer, but said simply, “There are over 10,000 Palestinians being held hostage in Israeli jails as we speak, many of them without charge or trial, including 400 children who are being held illegally under international law. People can take what they want from our music, stopping the genocide is more important.”</p>

Walker. Related Stories Jake Gyllenhaal Says He ‘Struggled' During Early ‘Othello' Shows: I Was ‘Insecure' ‘Sinners' Took a Nice Bite Out of a Random Tuesday at the Box Office Per the film's official synopsis: “Andy (Charlize Theron) and her team of immortal warriors are back, with a renewed sense of purpose in their mission to protect the world. With Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts) still in exile after his betrayal, and Quynh (Veronica Ngô) out for revenge after escaping her underwater prison, Andy grapples with her newfound mortality as a mysterious threat emerges that could jeopardize everything she's worked towards for thousands of years. Andy, Nile (KiKi Layne), Joe (Marwan Kenzari), Nicky (Luca Marinelli) and James Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) enlist the help of Tuah (Henry Golding), an old friend who may provide the key to unlocking the mystery behind immortal existence.” Last year, Theron told Variety that the release hold-ups had been a product of various changes at both Netflix and beyond. We got kind of stuck in that and our post-production shut down, I think, five weeks into it,” she said. “They were going through a lot of changes, and I totally understand it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Universal Pictures and 87North are continuing to build on their strong relationship as sources tell Deadline the studio has landed Fight from the company, with David Leitch attached to direct from a spec script written by Nathaniel Halpern. Plot details are being kept under wraps, but given Leitch and 87North's involvement, expect high-octane thrills with over-the-top action pieces. Kelly McCormick and Leitch, producers of the action films The Fall Guy, Bullet Train and Nobody, will produce Fight via 87North's first look-deal with Universal. EVP Production Development Jay Polidoro and Director of Development Tony Ducret will oversee the project for the studio. Universal will release 87North's next film with the studio, Nobody 2, on August 15. Leitch is currently in prep on his next pic How to Rob a Bank, which he will direct this summer and stars Nicholas Hoult and Pete Davidson. Schoenfelder and Ackerman were most recently executive producers on the Netflix/AGBO film The Electric State, and are EPs on the upcoming Skydance film They Will Kill You starring Zazie Beetz. Leitch is repped by CAA and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole. NeoText is repped by Adam Kolbrenner at Lit Entertainment Group and Robby Koch at Hansen, Jacobson, Teller, Hoberman, Newman, Warren, Richman, Rush, Kaller, Gellman, Meigs & Fox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Netflix has ordered The Age Of Innocence, a limited series based on Edith Wharton's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. The series was quietly greenlighted earlier this year and has been prepping for a fall start of production in Europe for a couple of months now. A fresh take on Edith Wharton's classic novel of forbidden love in 19th century New York, The Age Of Innocence is a will-they/won't-they love triangle exploring themes of freedom, duty, identity and love in all its forms. The project is clearly geared toward the wide global fanbase of Netflix's hit period romance drama Bridgerton, also a book adaptation. Frost executive produces with Peter Chernin, Jenno Topping and Tracey Cook of Chernin Entertainment, part of the North Road Company. Wharton's novel was notably adapted by Martin Scorsese in the 1993 Columbia Pictures feature starring Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer, Winona Ryder, and Miriam Margolyes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sarah Huckabee Sanders is begging President Donald Trump to reconsider the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) denial of an emergency disaster declaration to aid in the recovery from a series of destructive tornadoes and storms that ravaged the red state in March. Sanders, a former White House press secretary to Trump, wrote a lengthy letter last week to her ex-boss detailing the damage caused by the storms and begging him reconsider FEMA's denial. Less than three weeks later, Arkansas was once again devastated by a second wave of severe storms, tornadoes, and a generational flooding event,” Sanders wrote in her appeal. “Without the support of a Major Disaster Declaration, Arkansas will face significant challenges in assuming full responsibility and achieving an effective recovery from this event. It's unsurprising that states are already struggling to get disaster-recovery aid under the second Trump administration. During his first term, Trump had a habit of setting up roadblocks to states requesting disaster-relief aid depending on his personal relationship with — or the politics of — their leadership. The president once held out on approving aid funds for regions of California scorched by wildfires until staff presented him with evidence that people in the affected areas were actually his fans. During the 2024 election cycle, Trump falsely accused FEMA and the Biden administration of “stealing” billions in disaster aid to support undocumented migrants, while leaving parts of North Carolina devastated by Hurricane Helene to fend for themselves. When wildfires ravaged Los Angeles earlier this year, the president and his GOP allies floated conditioning aid to California with compliance to their own policy and ideological goals. These included forcing the implementation of Voter ID laws, and crackdowns on immigration. Trump Is Now Screwing Over Republicans in Need of Disaster Relief Warren Warns of ‘Backdoor Way' Trump and Musk Want to Gut Social Security Trump Attacks the Supreme Court, Says America ‘Cannot Give Everyone a Trial' Trump and Republicans have been salivating at the idea of eliminating the agency — because they think it would save money, or they want states to handle their own disaster relief, or both. The thing about natural disasters is that they don't have any conception of state lines, nor do they check your voter registration before leveling your house, which is why an agency like FEMA exists to coordinate the response to disasters that span multiple states, some of which might not have the resources to combat the destruction. While Trump and Noem are making hay over their plans to destroy FEMA, members of their own party are begging them to stand down.</p>

Here, Jennifer Lawrence plays a wife unraveling in the country, and married to Pattinson's character. LaKeith Stanfield, Nick Nolte, and Sissy Spacek also star in this adaptation of Ariana Harwicz's novel. Ramsay wrote the script with Enda Walsh and Alice Birch. Olivia Wilde Heads Back to Director's Chair with ‘Provocative' Date Night Comedy ‘The Invite' The film made it into Cannes just in time as hoped, and this means we'll be seeing Lawrence and Pattinson standing in front of glittering flash bulbs on the Palais red carpet. Roustaee was nominated for the Palme d'Or in 2022 for “Leila's Brothers,” a three-hour family epic starring frequent Asghar Farhadi collaborator Taraneh Alidoosti. In Un Certain Regard, Kristen Stewart's long-in-the-works directorial debut “The Chronology of Water,” starring Imogen Poots, will compete for the Camera d'Or.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tony Gilroy on why that sexual assault attempt against an "undocumented" fugitive in the show's season two premiere block was necessary to tell an accurate tale of revolution — even within the Star Wars universe. [This story contains spoilers from the first three episodes of Andor season two.] Disney+'s acclaimed Andor has stretched the creative boundaries of Star Wars in countless ways, bringing a grown-up sensibility to a galaxy far, far away. Yet even by Andor standards, a scene from the second season is leaving fans shocked: An Imperial officer tries to violently rape a Rebel fugitive, Bix Caleen (Adria Arjona), who is hiding out in a farming settlement while Imperial troops are rounding up “undocumented” citizens (read some sample reactions below). 2025 Nantucket Film Festival to Open With 'Twinless,' Jacinda Ardern Doc 'Prime Minister'; Tony Gilroy, Alex Gibney Among Honorees (Exclusive) Star Wars is a franchise that has never — in film form — shown even consensual sex. During its first season, Andor pushed the envelope with scenes that suggested sex was about to take place, or just had (much like old Hollywood films during the Hays Code censorship era). When asked about the Bix scene, Andor creator Tony Gilroy explained to The Hollywood Reporter that when telling a story about a war, shying away from sexual assault didn't feel truthful. I mean armies and power throughout history [have committed rape]. Asked about Disney's reaction to the scene, Gilroy says he didn't get any studio pushback. Bix has had a particularly brutal journey on the show so far, having already been captured and tortured by the Imperial Security Bureau during season one, an experience which has left her traumatized. One major Star Wars fan account wrote, “I don't want to see rape in Star Wars … You can portray power dynamics and making the audience hate the empire in other ways without taking it to such a disgusting place. Vader wouldn't tolerate that shit nor does the Empire condone it. Period.” Another pop culture fan account wrote, “I don't mind having mature Star Wars but I'm not ok with it going so far as depicting an attempted rape. I'm actually quite disgusted with the Andor series right now.” While another fan account was one of many that praised the move: “Andor dared to go to the darkest places Star Wars could offer. This is the real world seeping into Star Wars storytelling; this is the world WE live in, reflected in the galaxy far, far away, this is Star Wars at its most political, its most potent, its most frightening. I must commend the writing team's bravery to not shy away from such topics. To depict fascist regimes as they are, speak the word ‘rape' directly into the camera, show just how despicable fascists really are. And yet another fan account pointed out several previous suggestions of sexual servitude in Star Wars — often with scantily clad female characters (Princess Leia on a leash in her famous slave slave bikini in Return of the Jedi being a key example). “Seen some discourse already regarding what happens with Bix in Andor , that kind of thing has happened in Star Wars before except this time they called it what it was,” they wrote. The episode also featured a rather stunning sequence with Mon Mothma (Genevieve O'Reilly) furiously dancing at her daughter's wedding, even as she knew a man was about to be murdered to protect her secret ties to the Rebel Alliance. She has to do everything under glass, being examined all the time. She's tacitly involved in what will be an assassination and then has go back into the party, which is this joyous event for everybody else, in that kind of chaotic mental state and with that kind of guilt. And what's fascinating there is that there's nobody else in that room except you — the audience — who understands what's happening to her.” Andor is Disney+'s acclaimed Star Wars drama series which currently has the highest rating of any Star Wars TV show or movie on Rotten Tomatoes.

Listen to the new song below. “When the idea of a deluxe edition with covers/collabs first came up the literal first thought I had was ‘I gotta get Lindsey to sing Two Legs,'” Amos said in a press statement. “I've loved Snail Mail ever since Water From Your Eyes had a chance to tour with them so it was a joy to hear Lindsey bless the song like this.” Jordan added, “Within the last few years, following Nate's projects, I have come to the conclusion he is the best songwriter of our generation as well as a great guy. Along with Jordan and Lenderman's contributions, the record also features a new version of “Angel's Eye,” courtesy of Amos' father and sister.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In her centennial year, the Cuban singer will be honored with the Legend Award at Billboard's Latin Women in Music gala on April 24. Born one hundred years ago in Havana, Cuba, on October 21, 1925, Celia Cruz sang almost before she could talk. The second oldest of 14 children, she could carry a tune at 10 months old, according to her mother, and as a toddler, sang her youngest siblings to sleep. By the time she died in 2003 at age 77, Cruz had over 70 albums to her name and had transfixed generations of fans with her mesmerizing stage presence and a signature, rich, expressive contralto that could turn a single word into a masterpiece of a song. Cruz was recognized worldwide as much for her extravagant flamboyant outfits, tireless work ethic and colorful wigs as for her trademark cry of “Azúcar!.” But Cruz possessed, above everything, an extraordinary voice. “Forget about getting her behind a mic,” Marc Anthony once told Billboard. Indeed, Cruz adamantly refused to lip-sync, even on live TV shows. “I can't go out there and pretend,” she told Billboard in 2000. Although Cruz's dancing abilities weren't negligible, her voice was incomparable. Cruz's recorded legacy is a veritable history of Latin music, from her days with Cuba's legendary La Sonora Matancera to her highly experimental and avant garde later fare, which even mixed urban music with her salsa beats. Cruz charted until the day she died, and beyond. More than 20 years after her death, she generated 64 million on-demand official streams in the United States in 2024, according to Luminate. As a child, Cruz began singing in amateur contests. Her big break came in 1950, when she was called in to replace the lead singer of the legendary La Sonora Matancera, arguably the best salsa band of all time. Cruz gained international acclaim with La Sonora, with whom she remained for 15 years, eventually marrying lead trumpet player Pedro Knight. Following the Cuban revolution, she settled in New York in 1962 and was never allowed to return to her home country. Cruz's career also flourished stateside, first through her association with Tito Puente's Ticco Records and later with Fania Records. The secret to her perennial success, she told Billboard, was very basic: “First of all, I take good care of myself. I always try to shape my repertoire around a particular audience. And finally, I'm always changing my outfits, my look onstage.” But at the core of it was her tireless work ethic, and that voice. She recorded for two months and died in July. This year, Billboard's Latin Women in Music honors Cruz and her extraordinary life not on the anniversary of her death but in the centennial year of her birth. ET on Telemundo, and be honored with a musical tribute with performances by Ivy Queen, La India and Olga Tañon. Celia was someone who was able to bring our music to this country at a time when women weren't really welcomed in the music industry. She was such an example of humility, perseverance, talent — my God. But I didn't offer because we were just getting started. One night, we were playing at the Dupont Plaza, and she asked us to sit at her table. It was like talking to a queen. I remember one time we were performing at the Ovni, and we always played “Quimbara.” She was in the audience, and she came onstage to sing. I had the honor of producing several albums for her. One day she called me and said, “I don't have a record label anymore.” And I told her, “I'm going to send you to Sony.” Thank God I called Tommy [Mottola, who] said, “Don't even worry about it. We've got to sign her.” She went into Sony with so much respect. They were going to give her the boost she needed. She was one of the women who proved to the world that women could make everyone dance. She was such an inspiration for Gloria [Estefan]. I think we can all learn something from her. She and Pedro [Knight] were such humble, kind people who taught us so much. When we were recording, she was so professional. She could almost sing live; she practiced her parts, showed up with humility and was always so proud of her Cuban roots. And the love between her and Pedro… It's rare to work with a couple and see them love each other so much for so many years, being such simple, good people with so much talent. She was like a sister to Gloria. She'd come over to eat at our house and was so funny. She'd wash Pedro's shirts and iron them when they were on tour. I'll never forget when I produced the Latin Grammys [for CBS on 2000] — she had terrible knee pain but got up to sing “Quimbara” with Ricky [Martin] anyway. No one could tell what she was going through. One day she came to us and said, “I got the big C.” I had no idea what she meant. She called me to help arrange her burial. She told me, “I want every fan I have to be able to say goodbye to me.” She wasn't just loved by Cubans — she was loved by the whole world. She left me one of her dresses, shoes and wig as a thank you, along with a beautiful note for me and Gloria. And she made all of us shine. Her nephew was a big fan of mine and he would go see me at the Palladium. And of course we all loved La Sonora Matancera. One day, she sent a message through him, saying, “Muchas benidiciones en tu show.” (“Many blessings on your show.”) Then in 1990, a year before I decided to cross over from dance to salsa tropical, I was already collaborating with Tito Puente and Tito arranged for us to meet. When I met her, it felt as if we were already family. I'd like you to cross over from dance music and do a salsa album.” We sang with prerecorded TV tracks then, and she said, “You need to be up there singing with a live band.” She set up a meeting with Ralph Mercado [founder and president of RMM Records, to which Cruz was signed at the time] and said, “Hey, I want you to sign her.” We talked about believing in ourselves, being professional and giving 100% to the music. I found it to be very empowering. She used to say, “Yo soy tu madrina musical [“I'm your music godmother],” and she wanted to officially be my godmother. She baptized me on Feb. 14, which is the day of friendship and love, and it brought a lot of light into my life, which I needed. I think that's why it meant so much to me to be baptized with Celia and [husband] Pedro Knight [by my side], and because it meant she would always be in my life. She would walk in first, everybody was waiting for her, and we were like little ducks. Celia was always an icon, a living legend. He quit the trumpet to make sure she was ready to get on that stage and sing her heart out. She was very lucky to have him. In the studio she was a master of great ideas. I gave her a lot of energy, and it was great to have her there with me. She always told me that one of the things she liked about me was that she saw my talent and that I didn't have to wear little outfits. She would say, “Sabes porqué he tenido exito? It's a male-dominated world, and she wanted respect. She always tried to encourage the new generation by being positive and working hard. She spoke about the perseverance of hard work, professionalism. Always record, arrive early and have a great orchestra behind you. The Gente De Zona member on the group recording “Celia,” which blends two Cruz hits using her original vocals. Since Celia was banned in Cuba, you couldn't hear her on the radio or see her on TV. Celia, Willy Chirino, all those artists were prohibited. She was always a defender of freedom. After recording “La Gonzadera,” we were trying to figure out how we could use her vocals from “La Negra Tiene Tumbao” in a song. Her digital session recordings from her last recordings were nowhere to be found, but after 10 years of searching with Omer [Perdillo, her manager], we finally found them. What we did was mix two songs together, closing it out with “La Negra Tiene Tumbao.” But for us, using her voice — can you imagine? As a kid, I'd hear some of her stuff with my dad through videos that had been leaked. Cuba only had two TV channels, and there was a concert she did, I think in Africa, that somehow got through. For us, it was such a point of pride. A Cuban woman who was outside of Cuba, yet so huge in the music world — it seemed impossible to reach that level. When my dad heard the song, he was blown away. He was like, “How did you pull this off?” And I told him, “Dad, they gave me permission.” This whole story is so nostalgic for every Cuban, given the political situation. It's heartbreaking to see so many artists who don't get the chance to share their work. Celia was always ahead of the game when it came to music. She was someone who never let herself fall behind. But I traveled with her on the same bus from Buenaventura to Tuluá, and I got the chance to talk with her. I'd seen her on TV, but my dad collected albums and my mom was a huge fan of Celia. I've always been really close to my mom, and in many moments of her life, Celia's music was her soundtrack. “Ritmo, Tambor y Flores” was my first real connection to Celia. One of my aunts made me learn the song, and I sang it the first time I performed in a parade in Condoto. I was about 9 years old, and at my fifth-grade graduation, “Ritmo, Tambor y Flores” was already part of my repertoire. I went to see her in Buenaventura first. She was wearing white leggings, a shiny top and a short, white wig and she looked amazing. Like, wow — it wasn't often you saw women who could pull off a look like that. I saw music as something totally normal because my mom sang, my uncle brought artists and I'd go to the studios of Grupo Niche. So when they said, “Now we're heading to Tuluá on the bus with Celia and “El Canario,” it felt normal. And she said, “What a beautiful little girl. My mom told me to sing “Ritmo, Tambor y Flores.” She started singing the chorus, and I sang the second part because I was feeling a little shy. Imagine that — my skin still tingles thinking about it. Especially because kids are usually pretty sheltered at that age. Later, when I was 15, I saw her again, and by then, she looked older, and I was so impressed by the respect people had for her and how she kept thriving as an artist, even as someone who was already so established. She was always in the big leagues. What's happening now isn't possible without talking about her.

Deltron 3030 to Play Debut Album in Full for 25th Anniversary Tour Nearly thirty years later, Broadway audiences will see if that magic can be recaptured onstage. Billboard exclusively reveals that 10 Things is being adapted as a musical — with two major creatives keenly attuned to the nuances of young romance onboard. This isn't her first big turn in the musical theater realm — she took over the title role in the Broadway production of Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella in 2014 and played Frenchy in Fox's Emmy-winning Grease: Live —  but 10 Things does mark her debut behind-the-scenes, giving her a chance to show off her deeply emotional pop writing and talent for storytelling through song. Multihyphenate Dunham, whose much-anticipated romcom series Too Much comes to Netflix this year, is also making her debut on a Broadway creative team. Their collaborators, Gruska and Huang, round out a creative team stacked with acclaimed Broadway veterans. And producer Mike Bosner has a track record with boundary-pushing, Tony-winning Broadway hits, most recently producing Shucked and making his name as lead producer of Beautiful — The Carole King Musical. (Bosner is producing the musical through a special arrangement with Buena Vista Theatrical.) An opening date and theater for 10 Things have not yet been announced.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Later that day, Richie took media questions after judging the two-hour, live “American Idol” episode during which he, Carrie Underwood, and Luke Bryan made their final picks for the top 14. He looked pained when a reporter from Extra asked about the “sad news” that Pope Francis had died, and then shared why their meeting was so special to him. Richie met Pope Francis in December 2019 when he, “Britain's Got Talent” alum Susan Boyle, and 80s singer Bonnie Tyler were invited to the Vatican to perform a Christmas concert with an underlying theme of environmentalism, according to Rome Report. While there, Richie posted a photo of himself on Facebook and wrote, “Not every day you get to have an audience with the Pope at the Vatican.” Boyle also posted a Facebook photo of her with Richie and Tyler, noting that their concert would raise money for the Amazon rainforest. Recalling that day, Richie told Extra, “I had the wonderful pleasure of meeting him. “(But) he does it every day — masses of people! And when he's speaking to you — he spoke to my party, me, as if we've been friends for the longest time.” “I'm going to miss him,” Richie told Extra, “because he was in touch. Didn't matter what part of the world you're from, he knew how to relate. And my philosophy has always been, as my grandmother would say, ‘If you know how to treat somebody in Alabama, it applies around the world. On April 21, Richie's longtime love Lisa Parigi posted throwback photos of them with Pope Francis at the event and wrote, “There are moments that stay with you forever—this is one of them. Richie is not Catholic, but was raised as a Christian in Tuskegee, Alabama. In 2012, he told The Guardian, “God is wherever I am. I was born and raised a Christian, but I've learned from my travels that God has many names. Buddha, Allah, and Jesus all lead to the same thing – a higher consciousness.” “I left my mom and dad's house to go to Tuskegee University, and I met my Commodore friends there,” he told the outlet. “At the time I was seriously considering being an Episcopal priest. Richie opened the three-hour “American Idol” Easter special on April 20 by singing his 2009 song “Eternity,” backed by the top 24 contestants. “When they asked me to do it first, I was honored,” he told the outlet. And I've received so many people saying ‘Where'd that song come from?!</p>
