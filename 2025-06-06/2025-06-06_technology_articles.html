                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk's business empire, including SpaceX, Starlink, and Tesla collectively stands to lose at least $48 billion in sales over roughly the next decade if President Donald Trump acts on his veiled threat to cancel the companies' contracts with the US government, according to a WIRED review of publicly available data. Amid growing criticism from Musk on Thursday about the federal budget, Trump said that “the easiest way to save money” would be “to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.” The federal government typically retains sweeping authority to terminate contracts “for convenience,” a catchall term that can include budget constraints or shifting priorities. But in practice, severing ties with Musk's companies would be far from simple, carrying serious consequences for the US across areas like defense, space, and transportation. The legislation, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, advances Trump priorities such as cutting taxes and bolstering funding for border security, but it would also add $3 trillion to the national debt, according to an official estimate. Many observers predicted that Musk's financial support for Trump's reelection campaign and his role as an advisor to the White House would be a boon for ventures such as SpaceX, which has long done work for the US government. But now, the deteriorating relationship has become a significant business liability. If Trump seeks further retribution for Musk's attacks, federal government investigations and potential litigation into his companies could cost the billionaire at least $2.37 billion in purported penalties, congressional estimates from January show. Musk and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday. Most of Musk's work for the government is through his private space technology company SpaceX, which launches rockets and also sells satellite-based internet. Beside NASA, the US military heavily depends on SpaceX to help launch satellites into orbit for secure communications, spying on enemies, and GPS functioning. But SpaceX's competitors have faced numerous technical setbacks, and Musk's company remains the dominant market leader. WIRED didn't review detailed contracts or search for deals the government may have struck with Musk's companies through intermediaries. But the GSA's annual Federal Fleet Report doesn't break down the number of vehicles by manufacturer or offer details on future spending. Earlier this year, the Trump administration paused orders of new zero-emissions vehicles, dealing a blow to companies such as Tesla. Musk's companies have benefitted from government support for years. In February, an analysis by the Washington Post found Musk businesses had received at least $38 billion since 2003 in government contracts, loans, subsidies and tax credits across the US, including at the state and local levels. A New York Times analysis from October identified at least $15.4 billion in federal government contracts over the past decade for Tesla and SpaceX. But Musk himself has tried to take a chainsaw to federal spending through his work leading the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency which claims to have saved $180 billion since January, including by canceling contracts, though that figure remains highly disputed. Last month, Musk said he was stepping away from DOGE work to focus on his companies. Hiring freezes remain in effect, and the importance of stretching each dollar further is being emphasized more than ever at many federal agencies, according to representatives at two companies with major government contracts.

Both onstage at SXSW London and in conversation with TechCrunch, she spoke a lot about balance — the opportunities in finding it, and the risks of not having it during this AI revolution. Although some companies are touting AI as a way to replace massive numbers of workers, some tech leaders are speaking more openly about the importance of striking a balance at their companies: retaining human employees while augmenting them with AI assistants and “agents.” At SXSW London, Franklin said that looking to fully replace human workers might seem like a good idea in the short term for cost-saving reasons, but such a move might not actually be attractive to customers. Franklin also stressed the importance of transparency, accountability, and responsibility when it comes to AI. Leaders need to be transparent with employees about what the AI is doing, the AI must be narrowly applied to a particular goal so people understand how it works, and humans must ultimately be held accountable for what the AI impacts. In an interview with TechCrunch after her SXSW appearance, Franklin said Lattice has built an AI HR agent that gives proactive insights and assists employees in one-on-one meetings.

Update 6/6/2025 9:00 am ET: Jon Peddie has kindly provided us with comments regarding AMD's GPU business underperformance in Q1 2025. He believes that the sources of AMD's decline in GPU shipments lie in the company's failure to accurately predict demand for its GPU products six to nine months in advance, as well as the necessity to balance its TSMC allocations between Zen CPUs and Radeon GPUs. However, as both AMD and Nvidia rolled out their new-generation graphics cards in the first quarter, Nvidia managed to sell millions of its new GeForce RTX 50-series GPUs and capture its highest market share, while AMD struggled to sell even 750,000 add-in-boards, which is why its share dropped to a historical low. Nvidia now commands around 92% of the desktop discrete GPU market, while AMD's share declined to approximately 8%, the company's lowest share ever. In terms of market share dynamics, Nvidia was the only major vendor to expand its position, gaining 8.5%. AMD's GPU shipments totaled approximately 740,000 to 750,000 units, the company's worst results in three years. Jon Peddie, the head of Jon Peddie Research, believes the poor performance was a result of an AMD demand misprediction in Q1. "AMD and Nvidia have to walk a tight rope wire when it comes to placing orders at fabs like TMSC — and you never get it right all the time," said Jon Peddie, president of Jon Peddie Research, in a conversation with Tom's Hardware. "Forecasting demand six to nine months in advance, when the economic and political environment is so unstable adds an additional layer of complexity. Then you have yield issues on top of it all, and of course you have to get the specs right. Nonetheless, AMD has been doing this for decades and knows all those tradeoffs, plus in their case they have the added burden of balancing resources of demand for Zen CPUs against GPUs." Jon Peddie Research monitors how many GPU chips each company sells-in to its partners per quarter, not the number of cards sold through retailers. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Images of AMD's early Navi 48 graphics processors — the GPUs that power the Radeon RX 9070-series boards — indicate that their assembly took place in late October 2024, which means that production of the actual silicon started approximately 90 days prior, in late July 2024. This suggests that AMD had been building up inventory for several months ahead of the official launch on March 6, 2025. While the total number of GPUs and add-in boards accumulated before the release remains unclear, Jon Peddie Research reported back in March that AMD delivered around 1.43 million discrete desktop GPUs to partners in the fourth quarter of 2024. Although precise figures are not available, it is likely that AMD's partners shipped well over a million Radeon RX 9070-series graphics cards during the quarter. The reasons why AMD did not ramp up shipments/production of its Radeon RX 9000-series RDNA 4-based GPUs in late Q4 2024 – early Q1 2025 are unclear. However, JPR's numbers indicate that the company had reduced sales (and possibly production) of GPUs from Q4 to Q1, which is an unprecedented event. This likely means that shortages of AMD's latest Radeon products — the Radeon RX 9060 and 9070 series — will persist at least through the second quarter. "We were surprised to see AMD's shipments drop so drastically in Q1," said Peddie. "At the same time Nvidia was ramping Blackwell filling any vacuum AMD may have left. Both companies' products have been criticized at the low end, which is traditionally a volume market. But in the past few quarters, the high end has taken off and that is where Nvidia had an open playing field, and so far, still does. So, it is a combination of economic and political instability, and consumer demand shifting to the high end that has caught AMD in a crossfire so to speak." JPR reports that the desktop CPU market contracted sharply as volumes dropped by 14.5% year-over-year and 20.6% sequentially. "The PC market is caught in the crosswinds, some might say crossfire, of Trump's trade wars, with on-again and off-again, special cutout, and changing import/export rules," said Dr. Jon Peddie, president of Jon Peddie Research. "As part of the turmoil, some PC suppliers have pulled back or held orders, while a few have increased orders, hoping to lock in prices. Pre-ordering to lock in prices is a temporary fix, which will cause a depression in future quarters' sales, as discussed here. Anton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom's Hardware.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Apple prepares to unveil iOS 19 at WWDC 2025 on Monday, several rumors have surfaced, including a potential new name for the operating system, an entirely new design inspired by the Vision Pro, and more. This name change will also apply to other software updates, such as iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26. Anticipated to be the most significant design change since iOS 7, the operating system may feature a complete visual overhaul, one that's reportedly inspired by Apple's Vision Pro headset, according to Bloomberg. This could include translucent panels for navigation and circular app icons. For instance, the Phone app is rumored to introduce a new option that allows users to merge their favorite contacts, recent calls, and voicemails into a single view. Meanwhile, both the Camera app and Safari are anticipated to have more visual updates, such as a transparent address bar for Apple's browser app. This comes after the company acquired its first game studio, RAC7, according to DigitalTrends. Apple may also be developing an AI feature to serve as a personal health coach. There may also be a new charging icon on the lock screen that gives an estimated time for when it's fully charged. Another rumor suggests that reverse wireless charging is being tested on the iPhone 17 Pro models, allowing users to charge accessories such as AirPods or the Apple Watch directly from their iPhone. According to 9to5Mac, the Messages app is set to get an Apple Intelligence-powered translation feature that can automatically translate messages as soon as they hit users' inboxes. This will reportedly be a preinstalled app, per Bloomberg. One notable absence from all the rumors is the impressive Siri capabilities highlighted in Apple's 2024 presentation, which featured a more context-aware assistant that can gather information and perform actions across different apps. While we can expect some AI-related announcements, the primary focus is likely to be on design changes. Reports indicate that improvements to existing Apple Intelligence features will also be introduced, along with some new additions. This story was originally published June 3 and will be updated as more rumors come out.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That being said, there are important differences within the traditional "races", such as the finding in this study that people with West African vs. East African ancestries have different genetic propensities for obesity.Overall I would love it if medical research papers moved away from "race" and started getting more into the fine-grained genetic details. Regardless of the politics involved, this will lead to better medical treatments for everyone. Overall I would love it if medical research papers moved away from "race" and started getting more into the fine-grained genetic details. Regardless of the politics involved, this will lead to better medical treatments for everyone. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying there are no differences between ethnicities, just that those differences are based on ancestry not race. People of a specific "race" don't share the same ancestry all the time, some times they have more in common with a different "race" than their own. Race as we know it today is a means of classifying humans that came about at a time when colonial expansion was booming. Classifying people based on their outward appearance was all too convenient. It's like someone learning how to code who found out there are thousands of programming languages and categorized them using terms like "curly brace language","lots of parenthesis language","indentation oriented language". There isn't zero correlation which is why I disagree, as a matter of precision, with people who say race doesn't exist. The quality of a given taxonomy exists on a spectrum and race is a pretty damn bad one when you consider how inaccurately it separates the phenotypes it claims to care about, and how many genotypes/phenotypes (the vast majority) it fails to separate at all beyond a coin flip. The journal Nature Human Behaviour published ethics guidelines in Aug 2022 which touch on this:> Race and ethnicity are sociopolitical constructs. Humans do not have biological races, at least based on modern biological criteria for the identification of geographical races or subspecies.> Studies that use the constructs of race and/or ethnicity should explicitly motivate their use. Race/ethnicity should not be used as proxies for other variables — for example, socioeconomic status or income.https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01443-2There was a furore here in the discussion of it on HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32595083 Humans do not have biological races, at least based on modern biological criteria for the identification of geographical races or subspecies.> Studies that use the constructs of race and/or ethnicity should explicitly motivate their use.

That's because health conditions are heavily influenced by environmental factors, and someone's race impacts the environmental factors they're exposed to.This does get complicated, and requires digging deep into the data. Top-level statistics don't indicate root cause, which still needs to be researched. But top-level statistics can indicate that there's a problem that needs to be worked on, which is why medical studies tracking race are still useful. This does get complicated, and requires digging deep into the data. Top-level statistics don't indicate root cause, which still needs to be researched. But top-level statistics can indicate that there's a problem that needs to be worked on, which is why medical studies tracking race are still useful. "Traditional races" as you call them have changed over time and space, and we are only in this predicament because we lump different ethnicities together today. And Southern Italians, Irish vs Western Europeans vs Germans... etc.It's harder now because a) there has been a lot more mixing since then; and b) socioculturally we consolidated many of those ethnicities It's harder now because a) there has been a lot more mixing since then; and b) socioculturally we consolidated many of those ethnicities similarly, when working on genomes a few years back, it used to be said that the two most genetically distinct humans alive right then would both be from Africa, which was memorable because one might guess Inuit vs Africa or something like that naively. A and C have 10 genetic differences.We can make the claim that the genetic difference between someone from Africa and from elsewhere (B to C, thus 1) is much smaller than the difference between two people in Africa (A to B, thus 9). A and C have 10 genetic differences.We can make the claim that the genetic difference between someone from Africa and from elsewhere (B to C, thus 1) is much smaller than the difference between two people in Africa (A to B, thus 9). We can make the claim that the genetic difference between someone from Africa and from elsewhere (B to C, thus 1) is much smaller than the difference between two people in Africa (A to B, thus 9). The two statements seem nearly equivalent and the wrong one could accidentally be spread by someone who is really just trying to focus on expressing how much genetic diversity is within Africa. Non-Africans split from Africa relatively late in human genetic history. So, as you pointed out, C is likely more closely related one of A or B. This might sound like nitpicking, but most black people in the US have significant European ancestry and the admixture can vary wildly even for people with similar skin tones. Our naive view of "race" is not always backed by genetic reality. If you're taking a genetic test you want something that returns susceptibility to sickle cell amenia, cystic fibrosis, tay-sachs, et cetera. Race is a very low quality signal that is used when you lack something better, like a genetic test. There were earlier migrations of hominids, but the mark they left on our genetics is much smaller than the influence from later migrations.) Humans originated in Africa, so populations there have had more time to evolve and become more diverse.200,000 years of genetic drift versus 20,000 years makes a big difference. More precision is better, but we don't have rapid genetic tests that can distinguish West vs. East African ancestry on the spot, so race is the only proxy available when you're, say, treating a patient in the ER. idk I had always just called myself "American" and assumed I'd be a mix of a lot of things. I think that is an understandable feeling and I think that says a lot about the concept of race. Even if it's just 1 or 2% or even a trace amount, they're checking off boxes identifying themselves as multiracial.For the 2020 census, it resulted in a 276% increase in the number of people self-identifying with more than one racial group. This is far more than could be explained by immigration or children born to parents from different backgrounds since 2010.This NPR article (https://www.npr.org/2021/08/28/1030139666/2020-census-result...) explains the dynamic:Its findings suggest adults 50 and up are most likely to self-identify as multiracial on surveys after receiving a report about the potential roots of their family tree based on a DNA analysis of their saliva. The study of more than 100,000 adults registered as potential bone marrow donors in the U.S. also found that DNA test takers were especially likely to identify with three or more racial groups. ..."Native American was the one identity people really wanted to have and really wanted to prove," Roth says, adding that she has also found that some people stopped claiming Native American identity after the results of a test did not show any genetic ancestry.You can imagine the problem when self-reported racial identities could really cloud the waters for determining a suitable bone marrow donor or other health application.

In many cases I've seen where children of grandparents from a particular region showing up on those products as having low percentage heritage from those areas.If your grandmother was born in China and is - for all intents and purposes - clearly Chinese, yet you show up with 3% Chinese DNA on these products, does that mean you can't identify as having Chinese in your family background? If your grandmother was born in China and is - for all intents and purposes - clearly Chinese, yet you show up with 3% Chinese DNA on these products, does that mean you can't identify as having Chinese in your family background? Find me one person whose motivation for abandoning racial categorisation is genuinely rational and purposeful, not just some misguided progressive feel-good mission.Race is useful. Race was a crude approximation and better techniques are available today. There is a push to use a wider variety of reference genomes which makes sense especially now that that computers are more powerful. There seems to be an assumption by others here that going from an unsophisticated crude approximation to a sophisticated one will somehow validate their other assumption that 'race is only skin deep'. But in general, it gets dismissed as "Woke." You joke, but "assigned at birth" is probably apt. You may have discomfort or comfort in identifying with it. So it makes sense that you could be a Caucasian Hispanic. These all have just as much claim from a cultural-diaspora perspective eh? Though Indian should probably be more finely divided if we're being honest.If you really wanted to piss people off, we could of course lump Indian, Singaporean, Australian, American, etc. under English Ethnicity.The only reason Hispanic is one is because the conquistadors were really, really persistent, murderous, and shameless eh? If you really wanted to piss people off, we could of course lump Indian, Singaporean, Australian, American, etc. That said, there is probably a good argument for breaking out at least South Asian from Asian as a distinct top-level racial category, in the same way that MENA recently was. (But note that all of the top-level categories also have more detailed breakdowns available, and recent revisions have also moved to require the more detailed options to collected in a wider range of circumstances. The only reason these groups are included this way is because of lobbying power (for and against) and $$ and privileges related to being in or out of various categories.From an ontological perspective, your argument is BS looking at the actual distributions and ground truth of these groups. From an ontological perspective, your argument is BS looking at the actual distributions and ground truth of these groups. The modern concept of "race" in general is a BS construct that was invented to support and justify European imperialism, and which has long been recognized as having only the loosest relation to biological reality despite in its own terms being conceptualized as a biological reality of some importance.OTOH, its also produced very real communities of differentiated experience, identity, and treatment, and it is largely that which the US government system of race (plus one ethnicity, in the minimum scheme) is designed to gather data related to.> If I understand them correctly,You do not.> officially someone from Portugal or France is supposed to be Caucasian"Caucasian" is not part of the official race/ethnicity scheme used in US federal government reporting.

And that's been going on for longer than what we currently call European civilization. Hispanics are Caucasian in the original classification:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race Also critical race theory is compatible with these results. Critical race theory holds that race is as social construct, and can only be found in culture, not in genetics. It just signifies that your ancestors lived here at a particular time.So if someone says that they're Cajun, not creole, they're lying to you. The Champagne family came over directly from France.You might have seen Isaac Toups on TV hawking a cookbook. This means that when they were dropped off and told to go farm rice (which none of them had ever done before), they had to till their fields and deliver their product to New Orleans from the River Parishes, up to 60 miles away without horses. By the time the Cajuns got here, there were plenty of horses for working the land and other livestock that you were legally allowed to eat.Anyway, that's just one little speck of a much larger ethnic pie.

And so on, and so on...I think that some "cajuns" would be more willing to call themselves creole if they knew that in addition to the native americans, the other group that saved their asses when they came to the territory were the German creoles.

Figure 7C shows 63/124,341 self-identified Whites had predicted African ancestry from their genome, 45,206/45,761 Blacks, and 19/7,419 Asians.Figure 7D shows predicted European ancestry, which was 120,127/124,341 for Whites, 110/45,761, and 39/7,419 for Asians.

It's almost like our perceived identity is just a user interface, and the genetic code is the raw assembly language underneath. It makes me wonder, how much of our cultural narrative is shaped by these historical "coding errors" or, perhaps, deliberate obfuscations? I made pretty crystal clear it doesn't mean anything beyond that. ex Nazis I don't really care the Germans hated Jews, I do care they put them in camps and executed them. Pre-emptively slapping them would violate their individual liberties, walking across the street infringes on no one, and indeed if I tried to control the right to people to freely travel based on thought-police it would be far more dystopic than any potential racism.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Not only does it mandate you have a single copy of a game at any time, but you can also only have one instance of local save data on one system. Virtual Game Cards will also restrict you from playing Switch 2 games if you don't have your original Switch nearby. The process also turns all your digital games into Virtual Game Cards. Your save data kept on Nintendo's cloud servers should remain tied to your Nintendo Account, but getting those titles from one system to the other requires both consoles to be in the room at the same time, at least for the first time you set things up. When we happy few on the Gizmodo consumer tech team received our Switch 2 unit, we weren't considering just how messy this process could get if you didn't think to bring your original Switch. We loaded two of our own profiles onto the Switch but tied those games and services to one account. So we waited 4 hours for the Switch 2 to download Mario Kart World and now it's telling us that I need to have my original Switch on hand in order to play it. This option is meant for people with missing or damaged Switch units, but it's the only way to move forward if you don't have immediate access to your older handheld. Doing so may not brick the original Switch, but it would mean your system would be factory reset and you'd need to reinstate the user account on that device. Virtual Game Cards have been available to the original Switch family for close to a month, and Nintendo fans already had their share of complaints, but the Switch 2 is throwing these DRM issues into stark relief. Unless your files are backed up in cloud saves, you cannot simply jump from one system to another without downloading the save data first. This data transfer can go awry if you don't carefully read any on-screen prompts, as Gizmodo's Senior Editor of Consumer Tech, Raymond Wong, experienced when moving his Mario Kart 8: Deluxe game save to the new handheld. He said he accidentally overrode the transferred game save with a new, no-progress one that was saved in the cloud. As Wong voiced on X: why is a game save deleted from a Switch instead of simply copied over to another Switch? WHY is game save deleted and not just… https://t.co/2zxHKTRyGc Virtual Game Cards don't just hang up the process of playing games on a Switch 2. It means playing games across any of your Switch systems becomes a time-consuming, restrictive hassle. Apparently I can't play SMM2 like I always have because my Switch Lite is in the other room and powered down. The reason Nintendo invented Virtual Game Cards was to make sure nobody had more than one copy of a game tied to any one system. Rather than keeping all your games accessible from any compatible device, like on Steam, Nintendo's digital cards are a kind of digital rights management software that restricts you from sharing your old console with a friend so he can play your library. If you want to share games with your friends' systems, you can go through the process of temporarily transferring a game you own to their account, so long as they're in your “Family Group.” You have to do this over local wireless, and the game loan times out after two weeks. It's as if Blockbuster came back and started offering game rentals again, except you're doing it through your cousin's Switch 2. Nintendo's obsession with mandating every Switch owner only have a single copy of a game has only entrenched the decline of ownership in gaming.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Representatives Yvette Clarke (D-NY) and Beth Van Duyne (R-TX) launched the bipartisan Congressional Creators Caucus on Thursday, which aims to support the creator economy. But the U.S. government doesn't have much regulatory oversight or understanding of the creator economy as it stands, leaving creator businesses in a bind. “As digital content creators' online presence continues to reach billions globally, Congress must work to ensure resources and protections are in place to support their success in this new era of start-ups,” Representative Clarke said in a statement. The husband and wife duo have spent over a year lobbying on Capitol Hill to advocate for creators' needs. “We're trying to educate lawmakers about what the creator economy is, and that it's an actual job and that we are actually small businesses, and as a result, there are certain tax codes and things that apply to small businesses,” Matthew Patrick (the creator known as MatPat) told TechCrunch last year. Meanwhile, John and Hank Green have used their success on YouTube to launch businesses like the educational media company Complexly, which has headquarters in Indiana and Montana. As a Patreon blog post explains, creators often build businesses without the same protections that more traditional businesses have, like insurance, disaster relief, and access to loans. Even startups like Karat Financial have sprung up to fill in some of these gaps, providing business credit cards and banking to creators who are often denied these services because legacy financial institutions don't understand their businesses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After leading programming at ABC, running Paramount, and supercharging Fox by launching its broadcast network in the late 1980s, Diller no longer wanted to work for anyone else. As a free agent he quickly grasped the power of interactivity and built an empire that includes Expedia Group, almost the entire online dating sector (Tinder, Match, OkCupid), and an online media lineup that includes People, which wrote a hit piece on him early in his career titled “Failing Upwards.” In his absorbing memoir, Who Knew, the third act of Diller's career gets short shrift, as the road to becoming an internet billionaire is dispatched in a few dozen pages. So as a WIRED kind of reader, I start our interview by calling him out on the tea shortage regarding his life in tech. “What do you mean?” growls Diller, a notorious suffer-no-fools guy, who two weeks after publication is undoubtedly getting tired of book promotion. When I tell him I just wanted to hear wonderful details from his tech days, like the ones he shared about his earlier acts, his demeanor changes, and he cheerfully agrees with me. “I did whiz by it,” he says of his internet triumphs, citing time constraints. This is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter. SIGN UP for Plaintext to read the whole thing, and tap Steven's unique insights and unmatched contacts for the long view on tech. I try to make up for the omission in our conversation. To get things started, I remind him of a 1993 Ken Auletta New Yorker profile titled, “Barry Diller's Search for the Future.” It describes Diller's quest for a post-Hollywood third act using the metaphor of his newly found obsession with an Apple PowerBook. In every subsequent job, he set out to absorb voluminous information before making critical decisions. With the Apple laptop now he could have all this data at his fingertips. He also met Steve Jobs on his tour, who showed him the first few reels of a movie he was working on called Toy Story. “I've never had an aptitude for animation—I don't like it,” Diller says. Steve doesn't like to be turned down.” Diller describes his relationship with Jobs thereafter as tension-packed. He marveled at Jobs' business savvy but despised his scorched-earth tactics. When the internet took off, Diller went on a buying binge. He convinced Microsoft's Steve Ballmer to sell him Expedia, and it became the centerpiece of a travel group that now includes Hotels.com, Orbitz, and Vrbo. The total valuation of his companies is now over $100 billion. He credits most of it to “luck, circumstance, and timing.” The book provides evidence that there's more to Diller's success than happenstance. Even before becoming his own boss, Diller operated like a founder. He joined ABC in his mid-twenties as a woefully inexperienced nobody, and bucked decades of tradition by arguing that the network should show films in prime time—and the ratings blockbuster Movie of the Week was born. Then he pushed ABC to make its own movies, and even created the mini-series, notably Roots. When I tell Diller that this feat seemed to presage Netflix's entry into original content, he agrees, and adds a bit of commentary to Hollywood's current struggle with tech giants. “The incumbents stood by while Netflix took their business away from them,” he says. “It's hard to compete against that,” he says “It's not that these old media companies aren't going to survive. It's just they're never going to be the dominant player anymore. Attempting to shut down Diana Ross's Central Park concert amid thunderstorms, 1983 He writes that while the people he knows in the “algorithmic” movie business are even richer than the ones he hung out with earlier in his career, “I don't know anyone who is having any fun.” In our conversation, he extols the satisfying process of creating a narrative film and bringing it to market. In comparison, the best tech has to offer is something like Tinder. When he first saw its nascent form—it basically adopted the “hot or not” format to a dating app—he saw great possibilities, and snapped up the team. I mention that if ChatGPT had existed when Diller first worked in the William Morris mailroom, he wouldn't have had to painstakingly read every file. He could have simply uploaded the trove into a large language model and asked it questions. “That's why I think the future is unpredictable.” Unless, as Alan Kay once said, you invent it.

A team of scientists and developers from both the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has put together an impressive resin 3D printer that is able to create more than one material from the same resin. Even more exciting is that one of those materials is dissolvable, making it an ideal option for printing supports in place. In the world of 3D printing, there are two types of printers leading the way: fused deposition modeling (FDM) and resin printers. FDM printers are the ones you see squeezing filament out of an extruder onto a print bed. It's through this technology that the team was able to hone in on specific wavelengths to generate the differing materials. The printer is designed to use two different types of light beams when printing. Focusing these lights in tandem allows the printer to develop multiple materials from a single resin. This is used for the main object you're printing. When visible light hits the same resin, a solid material is formed that will dissolve in 15 minutes when placed in a lye solution. This is what makes the material ideal for printing supports. To demonstrate the system in action, the team has created a handful of objects that would be impossible to print otherwise. For example, they managed to print a ball suspended in a cage that moves about freely once the support material is dissolved. This also gives you an idea of what's leading the market. Unfortunately, you won't find any resin printers capable of creating two materials from a single resin but in the meantime, we can at least appreciate the work this team has done so far to innovate how we handle resin printing.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Several Nintendo fans who just received their Switch 2 and Mario Kart World bundle claim to have received boxes that had broken seals on them. According to multiple Reddit posts, the issue is widespread with several British retailers affected, including Currys, Argos, John Lewis, and Smyths — even those who reportedly purchased directly from Nintendo received boxes with broken seals. One Redditor claimed Argos staff told him that the issue was caused by Nintendo using “seals with insufficient strength,” leading to them breaking while in transit or storage. On the other hand, others claim that the seal was cut cleanly, as if with a knife or scissors, meaning it was unlikely to have happened accidentally. Someone who picked up their pre-order from Currys had the same issue. Some customers reported that their code was missing, so someone in the supply chain, at least in the UK, took it upon themselves to check for them. One even said seeing getting an “opened and examined” sticker on their retail box, possibly indicating that their newly-purchased handheld console had been tampered with. There's no official statement from Nintendo or other retailers about this yet, but it seems that the affected units all had the Mario Kart World bundle. EE and Currys were not immediately available for comment. This will give affected buyers some relief, especially as a few were already worried that they're getting a tampered unit or receiving rocks instead of the handheld. While a few were frustrated at the retailer for doing so, many more were disappointed at Nintendo because its packaging wasn't as protective of the precious contents as it should be.

In the ever-evolving world of insane GPU prices, tariffs, and frightful stock shortages, one intrepid PC builder has managed to swipe an Nvidia RTX 5090 from Walmart for "just" $1,679, more than $200 below MSRP. ", after scooping a PNY GeForce RTX 5090 from Walmart for the relatively low price of $1,679.99.

If you've recently searched for the Samsung Galaxy S25+ 512GB on Amazon, you might have come across something peculiar: the price is not visible. This is because of a very special trade agreement with Samsung: The manufacturer is wanting to keep price drops like this a secret – especially as it was released just a few months ago. On Amazon, the Galaxy S25+ 512GB is on sale at its lowest point to date for a limited time only: The 512GB model can be purchased for $869 which is 22% off the original list price of $1119. Make sure you grab yours before it runs out of stock! Both phones have the same basics: unlocked Android, smart AI cameras, and Samsung's latest ProScaler display. If you're looking for differences, the Galaxy S25 has a smaller 6.2-inch FHD+ display and starts with 128GB or 256GB of storage while the S25+ offers a larger 6.7-inch QHD+ screen and storage options of 256GB or 512GB (which is the one on sale right now). The S25+ also benefits from a higher pixel density, which makes images and text appear sharper. Beyond display and storage, the Galaxy S25+ stands out with a bigger battery (4,900mAh compared to the S25's 4,000mAh) for longer battery life for heavy users. The S25+ also supports ultra-wideband connectivity which is not available on the standard Galaxy S25 and enables features like precise device tracking and secure digital car keys. The best part of this Amazon deal is that the Galaxy S25+ 512GB now costs less than many standard S25 models, thanks to Amazon's limited-time sale. The S25+ is unlocked, so you can use it with any carrier, and it comes with a one-year warranty for extra peace of mind. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Silicon Valley investors and tech executives who loudly supported both US president Donald Trump and Elon Musk may now be forced to pick sides as the president of the United States and the world's richest man go through an extremely messy public breakup. Their high-profile bromance imploded this week when Musk began using his social media platform X to denounce Trump's signature policy initiative, known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which experts say would cut taxes, reduce health care benefits for poor people, and dramatically increase funding for immigration enforcement, while also adding trillions of dollars to the federal deficit. Musk has called the bill “a disgusting abomination” and claimed Congress is “making America bankrupt.” Trump responded on Thursday by suggesting he might cancel contracts Musk's companies have with the federal government. Trump gave Musk—a private citizen—unprecedented access to the White House and federal government by appointing him to run the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Their alliance was emblematic of a new era in Washington, where top Silicon Valley figures used their massive online platforms to support a candidate they believed would be good for business. So far, some people appear to be trying to walk a fine line between backing Musk while not outwardly criticizing the White House. “I'm a big fan of Elon,” Gerstner said, “and I also believe, and have fought for 30 years, over the fact that we need some sort of balanced budget amendment in the country.” He added that it was “unconscionable that we live a higher standard of living today by borrowing on a credit card that's going to come due” and is hoping the country finds its way to a “four- or five-year plan laid out by this administration.” In one of a series of rapid-fire posts on social media criticizing Trump and his administration on Thursday, Musk asked his more than 220 million followers whether it was time to “create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle.” In a reply, venture capitalist and Y Combinator president Garry Tan wrote that “kitchen table abundance” rather than “a bunch of grifting BS and virtue signaling and culture wars” should be prioritized. Aaron Levie, CEO of the cloud storage company Box, also voiced his support for Musk's idea. Some of Trump's high-profile backers from Silicon Valley stayed mostly quiet during the Trump-Musk flare-up on Thursday or tried to turn attention to other topics, including Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya, two tech industry veterans who are also hosts of the enormously popular All In podcast, which has featured friendly interviews with Trump and some of his cabinet appointees in recent months. As of Thursday afternoon, Palihapitya was posting on X about crypto, while Sacks shared a recent New York Times op-ed about AI policy. He followed up with a meme portraying Musk as rapper Kendrick Lamar, who was recently involved in a tense feud with fellow musician Drake. “Can't wait to see the All In podcast guys political beliefs disappear overnight,” Dar Sleeper, a former Tesla product manager, quipped on X. “Some might appreciate what Trump has done, calling off SEC lawsuits against crypto and calling off the Biden order on AI, but at the same time there's still a lot of angst about tariffs. That's the single biggest issue for tech right now.” Two sources who spoke to WIRED say that some investors and technologists might not be quick to embrace Musk because they are disappointed by how he handled DOGE. As the sun began to set outside the White House on Thursday, Trump and Musk were still trading barbs—and there's little sign their battle will end anytime soon.
