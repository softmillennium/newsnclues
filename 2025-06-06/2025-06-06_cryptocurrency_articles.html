                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why Circle's ‘Super Positive' IPO Could be Bullish for Ethereum: Analysts Circle's $1.1 billion IPO on Thursday reflected Wall Street's growing interest in stablecoins, but it may also strengthen institutions' conviction toward Ethereum, analysts told Decrypt. Although Circle issues its USDC stablecoin across more than 40 different networks, more than half of the stablecoin's circulating supply exists on Ethereum, totaling $36.7 billion, according to crypto data provider DefiLlama. According to Bitwise Senior Investment Strategist Juan Leon, USDC's concentration on Ethereum is primarily based around the network's prominence in decentralized finance, or DeFi. “Overall, it's a super positive development for Ethereum and Coinbase,” he said, referring to the San Francisco-based exchange that has a revenue-sharing agreement for USDC with Circle. Ethereum was recently trading hands around $2,500, a 3% dip over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Other Layer-1 networks, including Avalanche, Sui, and Aptos, each hold less than 2% of USDC's circulating supply. In addition to Ethereum's mainnet, Circle has issued around $10 billion worth of USDC across Ethereum scaling solutions like Polygon and layer-2 networks like Arbitrum and Base, as well as Hyperliquid, the Arbitrum-based network underpinning the decentralized exchange. Circle's IPO is likely to generate interest in the company's business model, and as investors start evaluating how stablecoins work, Ethereum name is likely to come up as technology powering emergent tech, Gerry O'Shea, head of global market insights at asset manager Hashdex told Decrypt. “I think this could potentially help generate more attention around Ethereum and other smart contract platforms as investors look to understand the infrastructure that powers stablecoins,” he said. Although the products have generated net inflows over the past eight trading days, Thursday's inflows were relatively subdued at $11 million, compared to a recent peak of $110 million on Tuesday, according to crypto data provider CoinGlass.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum has so far underperformed in this market cycle but looks ready to mount a parabolic rally based on analysts' predictions. Crypto analyst Crypto Bullet recently highlighted a bullish pattern on ETH's chart, which provides a bullish outlook for the altcoin. Ethereum Eyes $3,300 As Morningstar Candle Pattern Forms In an X post, Crypto Bullet predicted that Ethereum could rally to $3,300 as a Morningstar Candle pattern forms for the largest altcoin by market cap. This came as he highlighted the bullish monthly close for ETH and alluded to the monthly chart printing this bullish pattern. With this, the analyst expects a significant rally from Ethereum. Crypto Bullet noted that Ethereum is now facing tough resistance, but he believes that the $2,500 resistance will be broken. The analyst added that his next target is $3,300. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ash Crypto also provided a bullish analysis for ETH, in which he declared that the Wyckoff accumulation was still in play. He remarked that the first major level to reclaim is $3,100, which will be followed by a small correction. Following that, Ash Crypto is confident that ETH will then surge to $4,000, which will initiate an explosive rally. The analyst affirmed that $10,000 is programmed for ETH in this cycle. As NewsBTC reported, crypto analyst Crypto GEM recently predicted that Ethereum could rally to $8,000 by next year. He highlighted a similarity between Ethereum's current price action and that of the 2017 market cycle. He noted that ETH has kicked off a sharp reversal, forming a classic V-shape structure on the weekly chart. He also declared that the fifth time of ETH's move to the MA20 will be a thrust through.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin manages to shake off a US nonfarm payrolls beat as Trump insists yet again that the Fed begins to cut interest rates — will Chair Jerome Powell listen? US President Donald Trump switches his focus from Elon Musk to Fed Chair Jerome Powell as he demands interest-rate cuts. Bitcoin continues its rebound from the Trump-Musk debacle despite strong US employment data. Liquidity sparks fresh concerns of a downhill BTC price “cascade.” Bitcoin (BTC) passed $104,000 at the June 6 Wall Street open as strong US labor market data contrasted with fresh calls for interest-rate cuts. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD up 2.5% on the day. Having recovered from snap losses over the ongoing spat between US President Donald Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, markets digested fresh inflation cues as Trump turned his attention to the Federal Reserve. Despite him, our Country is doing great,” he continued, referring to Powell. As Cointelegraph previously reported, markets see little chance of cuts coming before the Fed's September meeting, per data from CME Group's FedWatch Tool, with Trump's full point's worth fully priced out. An official release from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) confirmed that “total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 139,000 in May, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.2 percent.” Related: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons metric just delivered its 3rd ‘buy' signal of 2025 Earlier, Cointelegraph noted various downside price predictions for the short term, with commentators agreeing that BTC/USD could fall below $100,000. “This $BTC liquidation map (optical_opti timeframe) reveals a massive cluster of long liquidations between ~99k and 102k,” part of an X post read on the day.

(NYSE American: KNW (“Know Labs” or the “Company”), a technology innovator specializing in non-invasive health monitoring solutions, today announced that it has entered into an agreement with Goldeneye 1995 LLC (“Buyer”), an affiliate of fintech investor, entrepreneur, and former Ripple Chief Risk Officer, Greg Kidd, to acquire a controlling interest in the Company.

Founder Ron Erickson will serve as President of a new division that will retain a team of scientists to continue the Company's proprietary diagnostic research. “Partnering with Greg Kidd marks a pivotal next chapter for Know Labs,” said Mr. Erickson. “We look forward to continuing our research in non-invasive medical technology. Greg's visionary leadership positions Know Labs for a bold future.” Cohen & Company Capital Markets (“CCM”), a division of J.V.B.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) has filed a civil forfeiture complaint to seize over $7.74 million in cryptocurrency and NFTs, allegedly connected to North Korean money laundering operations. What Happened: The Justice Department is moving to seize a range of cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins, Bitcoin BTC/USD, NFTs, and Ethereum ETH/USD Name Service domains—stored in self-custody wallets and Binance accounts. The DOJ claims that North Korean IT workers, under false identities, earned the crypto while working remotely for blockchain firms. The funds were originally frozen in April 2023 after Sim Hyon Sop, a China-based banker, was indicted for allegedly helping facilitate the money laundering scheme. The Justice Department alleges that the North Korean IT workers used fake identification documents and other strategies to secure employment in multiple countries. After being paid—often in stablecoins like USDC and Tether—the workers allegedly employed money laundering methods such as chain hopping and converting tokens into NFTs to conceal the source of the funds. Cybersecurity firm DTEX likened North Korea's cybercrime operations to a mafia organization, with Fortune 500 companies exploited to fund North Korea's nuclear program.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Bitcoin's BTC$104,655.32 broader outlook is constructive, but its short-term prospects remain bleak, according to technical analysis. The leading cryptocurrency by market value has bounced back to nearly $104,000 from its overnight low of $104.30, alongside positive action in U.S. equity futures. However, a closer look at the hourly price chart reveals that the bounce is likely a classic breakdown and retest play – the cryptocurrency dove out of a head-and-shoulders pattern on Thursday, signalling a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change, and prices are now revisiting the breakdown point, called the neckline. It leads to a bounce that usually runs into fresh selling at the neckline from those who missed the initial breakdown. These fresh shorts lead to the next leg lower. In other words, BTC is not out of the woods yet, and prices could turn lower from around $104,000, extending the pullback. The immediate support is at $100,000, followed by $95,500. On the higher side, a move above $107,000 is needed to invalidate the bearish setup and shift focus to record highs. Omkar holds small amounts of bitcoin, ether, BitTorrent, tron and dot.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>May 2025 marks a turning point for the entire Web3 ecosystem. According to the new Dapp Industry Report by DappRadar, we witness a significant recovery in several verticals: DeFi, NFT, and AI show concrete signs of consolidation and growth. With 25 million daily active wallets, a 25% growth in DeFi TVL, and a 40% increase in NFT trading volume, the narrative is changing: from cyclical speculations to a concrete, mature, and distributed use of dapps. The report highlights how the number of daily active unique wallets (dUAW) increased by 8% compared to April, reaching 25 million. This widespread growth reflects a renewed enthusiasm from users, driven by three main sectors: We are entering a phase in which DeFi, Gaming, and AI compete for users' attention on an equal basis. A balance that, as highlighted by DappRadar, represents an important sign of maturity for the entire sector. If April was dominated by the memecoin mania (Pump.fun above all), in May there was an transition from hype to utility. In summary, the dapps that are growing the most today are not those based on speculation, but those that solve real problems: from smart communications to scalable decentralized finance, including gaming with persistent identities. The credit goes partly to the rally of Ethereum (+40%) and Bitcoin (new ATH), but also to significant infrastructural developments. The most surprising dapp is Hyperliquid, a DEX that has reached a monthly trading volume of $244 billion, capturing 10% of Binance's market share. With these figures, it enters the world's top 5 for trading volume, surpassing numerous centralized exchanges. DeFi is thus structuring itself as a concrete alternative to the CeFi world, strengthened by technical updates, regulatory clarity, and renewed investor trust. According to a Harris poll commissioned by Digital Currency Group: The sector remains partly tied to incentive mechanisms (airdrop and farming), but the signs of an evolution towards utility and mobile scalability are concrete. Despite fewer incidents compared to April, May saw $275 million lost in just 7 attacks, making it the 3rd worst month of the year. There is a need for more stringent audits, real-time monitoring tools, and greater technical education for developers and users. The DappRadar report shows a more mature, balanced, and innovative Web3. The sector is shifting from volatile experimentation to building robust infrastructure. The future of dapps will be determined by utility, interoperability, scalability, and security.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>said Brock Pierce, the former child actor who grew up to be a prominent cryptocurrency entrepreneur. A hundred or so people sat in various states of conversation and intoxication at a Las Vegas Maggiano's that DNA Fund, a Pierce-founded venture, had rented out for several days during the official Bitcoin 2025 Conference last week. We had just heard a bizarre speech from New York City's mayor, Eric Adams, who said Pierce and his colleagues in crypto were "pioneers" like Betsy Ross, who became a historical icon for stitching the first American flag featuring stars and stripes. "So although the rockets' red glare and bombs burst in air, they proved through the night that our flag is still there," said Adams. An aspiring crypto entrepreneur made his pitch — a way to earn yield on bitcoin — but after a few minutes of back-and-forth, Pierce and the judges shot him down. After the show, attendees enjoyed a three-course Maggiano's meal of family-style Italian staples. Pierce, a former business partner of Steve Bannon whose recent headlines tend to center on lawsuits over a hotel in Puerto Rico and his friendship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's son Yair, held court in a corner of the restaurant where Adams was also entertaining guests. For entrepreneurs like Pierce, where life is a constant montage of networking, dealmaking, and self-publicizing via social media, it was just another day. DNA House has hosted events around the world, trailing large crypto gatherings in Toronto and the United Arab Emirates. And for many of his guests, gorging on wagyu beef stuffed shells and truffle mac and cheese, it was much the same: another alcohol-soaked party in a week filled with them, as the bitcoin faithful celebrated their ascendant political power. More than anything, Bitcoin 2025 was a victory celebration for an industry that pushed all its chips in behind Donald Trump and the Republican Party during the 2024 election cycle and won handsomely. The first day, which was dubbed Code and Country, was so replete with Republican politicians, Trump staffers, and chest-thumping executives that it might've been mistaken for CPAC. Sponsored by America250, an ostensibly nonpartisan 501(c)(3) charged with planning the events making up the government's official 250th birthday celebration, the Code and Country program ended up revealing a lot about bitcoin's evolving position in American politics. Bitcoin's adherents still tout foundational ideas like decentralization and a libertarian exit from society, but the MAGA and big-money tilt are unmistakable. As I saw on full and often surreal display over three days and nights in Vegas, the immediate future of bitcoin lies in the cryptocurrency industry's tight alignment with Trump, and its growth is now dependent on its adoption by large corporations, union retirement funds, the federal government, and a handful of billionaires racing to acquire as much of the stuff as they can. Bitcoiners have always leaned right — challenging the state's monopoly on issuing money can do that — but it was a broadly libertarian right that included latter-day digital goldbugs, hard-money obsessives, anti-state sovereign citizens, and cypherpunks seeking some kind of supranational independence protected by the mathematical magic of encryption. The US president was not envisioned to be among this crew, and Trump famously denounced bitcoin as a "scam" during his first term. As real money flooded into bitcoin, the cypherpunks were superseded by venture capitalists, money launderers, authoritarian tech billionaires, and a broad swath of the MAGA movement that saw bitcoin's general anti-government orientation as consistent with Trumpian populism. Many of them also saw it as a way to get rich. But the transformation of bitcoin's $2 trillion political economy has mostly left everyday retail traders behind. It remains little used as a currency, with El Salvador, the one country to officially adopt bitcoin as a currency, scaling back its project. In the 2024 election cycle, bitcoin's overwhelming partisan shift became impossible to ignore when the crypto industry raised more than $200 million to support Trump and a slate of largely Republican candidates. It's a dizzying turnabout for an industry that, last year, described itself as constantly on the defensive against a Democratic administration and regulatory state that it thought was bent on destroying it. Now, the main headache for many crypto CEOs isn't former SEC Chair Gary Gensler or Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Instead they must contend with the president himself, who, with his growing portfolio of crypto companies, has brought some unwelcome attention to an industry trying to force through Congress a friendly regulatory framework for dollar-pegged stablecoins — another business in which Trump has lately become involved. The sheer influx of Republican politicians spoke to that, with pro-crypto stalwarts like Sen. Cynthia Lummis, Rep. Tom Emmer, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Sen. Jim Justice, and Rep. Byron Donalds among many party notables appearing on panels. Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. had their turns on the main stage ("I truly believe we're just at the beginning. Opportunity abounds," said Trump Jr.), as did the White House crypto and AI czar David Sacks, the Trump advisor and campaign cochair Chris LaCivita, and the White House crypto advisor Bo Hines. On Wednesday, Vice President JD Vance, a former venture capitalist, gave the day's opening keynote to a full crowd that began assembling at 5:30 a.m. He added: "With President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House." "The innovators in this room are making people's lives better. You deserve respect and support from your government, not bureaucrats trying to tear you down," said Vance, to vigorous applause. With crypto having just come in from the political cold, there was an undertone of subversion to it all. Someone wore a T-shirt that read "Everything I love to do is illegal." Another wore an ivory white suit decorated with the word TEXIT, in support of a Texas secession movement. A number of accountants and financial advisors on the conference floor peddled tax-mitigation strategies, with the sign from Tax Network USA offering the brazen solicitation: "Ask Us About Tax Avoidance." As Trump opened his second administration by pardoning convicted fraudsters while several SEC cases were put on hold, some crypto billionaires found it safe to visit the United States. The Bitcoin 2025 conference featured an appearance by one of those crypto entrepreneurs who had recently benefited from the SEC declining to pursue a multibillion-dollar fraud case it had prepared against him. Tron's founder, Justin Sun, a Chinese crypto billionaire, became the biggest investor in Trump's World Liberty Financial and the largest purchaser of the $Trump meme coin, which earned him a gold watch at Trump's recent gala for the top 220 owners of his token. A peripatetic executive who lives in Hong Kong and claims citizenship from St. Kitts & Nevis (he's also the prime minister of an unrecognized country called Liberland), Sun hadn't been seen in the US in years. But there he was at Bitcoin 2025, where he was applauded on the main stage and photographed with industry figures. Equally feted was Paolo Ardoino, the CEO of Tether, the world's largest stablecoin company, which operated in Hong Kong and the Caribbean for years before recently moving its headquarters to crypto-and-MAGA-friendly El Salvador. Ardoino gave a keynote speech and participated in a fireside chat on the main stage with Brandon Lutnick, the Cantor Fitzgerald executive who handles Tether's accounts, a position he inherited from his father, Howard Lutnick, Trump's commerce secretary. "This year is your first time in the US," said Brandon Lutnick, more than once. No one bothered to mention why Ardoino, who's 41, had never been to the States: His company had already reached multiple settlements with US regulators, and Ardoino and his colleagues were reportedly being investigated by the Department of Justice on suspicion of violating sanctions and anti-money-laundering rules, along with possible bank fraud (Ardoino said last year that he didn't think Tether was under criminal investigation). Before Trump's reelection, setting foot in the United States might have been a quick way for Ardoino to earn an interview with the FBI. It wasn't just crypto's quasi-outlaw kingpins who were embracing a newfound freedom. Several speakers said that they had expected to be in jail this year — for what reasons, they didn't specify. "Tyler, I think you mentioned that a year before that you thought it was much more likely that you'd be in the jailhouse than the White House," the cryptocurrency billionaire Cameron Winklevoss told his twin brother during a panel with David Sacks. "I think the president appreciated that," said Sacks. "He similarly was facing lawfare a year ago, when his political enemies were trying to put him in prison for 700 years. Companies like Exodus, Frax, Kraken, Coinbase, and Justin Sun's Tron were listed as sponsors. Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, the legendary hip-hop group, came out for a performance. Rosie Rios, the chair of America250 who, on a conference panel that day, described herself as a "fiscal conservative," bobbed her head as they rapped about blunts and rum. The goldbug Peter Schiff, who, while facing tax and money laundering investigations over his private bank in Puerto Rico, has made a sideline out of media appearances sparring with bitcoiners, sat on a couch surrounded by a retinue of young women. Bottles of iced Moët rested on tables in poolside cabanas. (Schiff, who sued the IRS, has accused government authorities of conspiring to frame his bank.) Bone Thugs transitioned into their song "1st of Tha Month" — a gold-charting, mid-'90s anthem celebrating the date when welfare checks arrive — as a group of women in cow costumes marched out carrying glowing signs that read "Steak 'n Shake" and "Accepts BTC." This sort of hallucinatory marketing stunt — part of Steak 'n Shake's ongoing MAGA/MAHA pivot, as the fast-food chain embraces beef tallow and bitcoin — was essentially standard fare for a week filled with constant offers, giveaways, pop culture callouts, and promises of easy riches and financial liberation. There was always another bitcoin raffle to enter or party to seek out, and the difference between what was legitimate and what wasn't could be a matter of interpretation. The names of both brands were printed across a blue curtain, in front of which guests and models hired from a local agency took photos. Later, I ended up at a party for the Taproot Wizards, a kind of low-fi, deliberately unserious group of coiners who wish to "make bitcoin magical again." Walking into the psychedelically lit Discoshow venue at the Linq Hotel, I was handed a shiny silver wizard hat and cape, which I duly put on. A bearded man in full mage garb held out his hand, offering what looked like a brown capsule. Inside, the bar served free cocktails and cans of Liquid Death water. No one seemed to be talking about bitcoin. In Vegas, the future of bitcoin was corporate. "Bitcoin treasury companies," publicly traded corporations that are essentially holding vehicles for accumulating bitcoin, were all the rage, as several CEOs took turns paying tribute to Michael Saylor, the tech executive who has borrowed billions of dollars to turn turn his enterprise software company MicroStrategy into one of the world's largest holders of bitcoin. Saylor has encouraged other companies to adopt his "playbook," and GameStop and Trump Media recently announced that they would follow suit. In panel presentations, CEOs described future markets in which most companies would have bitcoin on their books, if not being explicitly devoted to it. Financial institutions and individual investors could then buy shares in those companies, like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet, which are publicly traded, and benefit from those companies' bitcoin exposure, broadening the circle of prosperity. A similar philosophy undergirded the growing adoption of ETFs, Wall Street funds that provide investors exposure to bitcoin without making customers go through the trouble of purchasing actual bitcoins. (These financial firms, in turn, benefit from the fees they reap from managing investments in ETFs, bitcoin treasury companies, and other crypto-based financial products.) "At the end of the day, it's a game and we're all going to win together," said Fold CEO Will Reeves, whose company had recently begun building its bitcoin treasury. Saylor, the silver-haired 60-year-old executive whose self-described "religious" embrace of bitcoin has catalyzed this corporate treasury movement, was one of the conference's chief draws. His keynote, on the event's third and final day, was standing-room only. Wearing all black except for a silver bitcoin pendant that hung below his throat, Saylor emerged to rock-star-level applause. Speaking in his typically craggy voice, he preached a post-cypherpunk prosperity gospel under the unassuming title "21 Ways to Wealth." "Satoshi gave you an idea worth half of everything on earth," said Saylor. Scrolling through 21 instructive axioms — "master artificial intelligence," "domicile where sovereignty respects your freedom" — each accompanied by an AI-generated image, Saylor told his audience not to "chase your own good ideas." "Raise and reinvest capital relentlessly — velocity compounds wealth," read one slide. Why aspire to be merely rich when you could be the "first billionaire dentist on your block," he said. Over the past few years, Saylor has raised billions of dollars in debt to make periodic bitcoin purchases, MicroStrategy's stock has soared, and his once criticized thesis of constant corporate bitcoin accumulation is on the verge of being widely imitated. (Last year, Saylor agreed to pay $40 million to settle a tax fraud lawsuit filed by the Washington, DC, attorney general.) "This is a race to capitalize on bitcoin," Saylor said, sounding far more zero-sum than the we're-all-going-to-win CEOs who had praised him hours earlier. Ross Ulbricht, the speaker who followed Saylor, had attained practically mythological status among diehard bitcoiners. One of the first major dark web drug markets and a transformational event in bitcoin's history, the Silk Road provided it a clear use case: buying drugs online. As one former Silk Road customer turned crypto industry professional once told me, the Silk Road was the greatest onboarding event in bitcoin history. For years after Ulbricht received multiple life sentences without parole, coiners had lobbied for his release, until Trump pardoned him on January 21 of this year. After an introductory video chronicling his years in prison followed by shots of him surfing, swimming, and diving into waterfalls, Ulbricht came out to warm applause. But the crowd had thinned since Saylor's commanding speech — some chairs sat empty — and would get thinner as Ulbricht went on. He tried to rouse the audience with a cry of "Freedom!" "I'm so, so thankful that we elected him and he is who he is," Ulbricht said of Trump. In his speech, he acknowledged starting the Silk Road but said almost nothing about why he went to prison, the drug war, or the flawed criminal justice system (some Silk Road investigators were prosecuted for stealing evidence). There were some general appeals to principle, but it was a stilted, overlong presentation by a figurehead who seemed to have been far more appreciated when he was locked up out of view. Ulbricht offered a stem-winding anecdote about renting a secluded cabin, where he planned to grow magic mushrooms for his nascent drug market. He found the cabin covered in seven wasp nests. The wasps reflected some of Ulbricht's most treasured principles — freedom and decentralization. But they lacked another, unity, which made it easy for him to destroy each nest in turn. No one seemed as jazzed about Ulbricht's stoic devotion to decentralization as they did about Saylor promising to share the everlasting cyberfire of half the world's wealth. In a week of politically infused celebrations, this was supposed to be Ulbricht's moment. There had been a special lunch for him that day, one of many fundraisers since his release. "Free Ross," a mantra that had been printed on stickers handed out at every bitcoin event for a decade, had won. But bitcoin's top political prisoner, its once occluded hero, had bored a crowd with abstract talk of freedom and insects. That night, I went to another bitcoin-related party at a nightclub in the Venetian. A DJ played some recent hits while a mix of middle-aged coiners and Gen Z club kids swayed and pawed at each other's bodies. Some women in gravity-defying dresses danced on an elevated bar while velvet ropes denoted exclusive areas, where tables could run a couple of thousand dollars. "I've had such a hard time orange-pilling my friends," she told me. But her bitcoin investments had gone up 140% in the past year. She asked if I had done the same. I gave a halting answer about not investing in what I write about and not really having much of a retirement account anyway. She looked at me as if I were from another planet before her face adopted a look of profound concern.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You've probably heard the phrase NFT royalties thrown around like digital confetti, but what does it actually mean? For digital creators, this sounds like the holy grail of internet art: work less, earn more. But here's the million-dollar (or at least million-satoshi) question: Can NFT royalties really be trusted to keep the cash—or crypto—flowing forever? Or is this all just a digital daydream waiting to fade out with the next bear market? Okay, time to peek behind the curtain: how do NFT royalties actually work? Is there a magical robot accountant keeping tabs on resales and sending out crypto coins? At the heart of it all are smart contracts—basically, bits of code that live on the blockchain and do exactly what they're told, no questions asked. When you create an NFT and list it for sale, you can embed a rule in the smart contract that says, “Hey, every time this NFT is resold, send me 5% (or whatever percentage I choose).” It's like setting up a tip jar that automatically refills itself every time someone else gets their hands on your art. The cool thing is, this cut gets taken out of each secondary sale and sent straight to your wallet—no middlemen, no awkward payment reminders. Now, not all NFT marketplaces are created equal. Platforms like OpenSea, Rarible, and Foundation let creators bake in their royalties right from the start. These platforms are basically like your chill artist friends who always split the check fairly. But here's the twist (you knew there'd be one): just because you set royalties doesn't mean every platform honors them. Some newer marketplaces have started skipping out on royalty payments to attract sellers and buyers with lower fees—which has sparked quite the drama in NFT town. So yes, NFT royalties are a pretty neat system—at least in theory. But is it all smooth sailing from here? Let's talk about why NFT royalties have artists doing virtual backflips. Traditionally, when you sold a piece of art, that was it. You got paid once, and if that art resold later for millions? Royalties give creators more than just money—they offer independence. Artists, musicians, photographers, and even meme makers can now: This is a big deal in the digital economy. A few examples of NFT royalty magic in action: Sure, not everyone is making millions, but these stories show what's possible when royalties work as promised. NFT royalties, at their best, turn creativity into a sustainable hustle. Okay, so NFT royalties sound like a dream, right? Passive income, creative freedom, and no stuffy gatekeepers telling you what to do. But before you quit your job to become a full-time NFT artist, let's talk about the not-so-glamorous side. Royalties only come in when an NFT is resold. So what happens if nobody's buying or selling your work anymore? In short: NFT royalties depend on ongoing demand, and that can be a wild ride. They're usually enforced by platforms like OpenSea, Rarible, or Magic Eden—meaning… Unless platforms agree to work together (spoiler: they don't always), creators can get left out. Some buyers purposely use NFT marketplaces that ignore royalties to save money—especially on expensive NFTs. Imagine working for months on an artwork only for it to be sold later without a single cent coming back to you. Let's be honest: not every NFT project is a forever success. Trends fade, collectors move on, and even the coolest JPEGs can lose their luster. So yes, NFT royalties can feel like magic, but the spell doesn't always last. Next up, we'll talk about what the future could look like—and whether there's still hope for creators looking to turn pixels into paychecks. Alright, now we're heading into the land of laws, rights, and digital drama—because yes, even in the wild world of NFTs, the boring-but-important stuff like intellectual property and regulations still matter. This becomes super important if someone starts selling T-shirts with your art or making spin-offs. Without clear copyright terms in the NFT metadata or contract, things can get messy fast. Even with smart contracts, NFT royalties can lead to disagreements: Governments and regulators are starting to take notes: For creators, this could be good news—especially if future laws help lock in royalties as a right, not just a nice-to-have. So you're ready to ride the NFT wave like a pro surfer, and you've got your sights set on those sweet NFT royalties. But before you start counting passive income in your sleep, let's go over a few smart strategies to help you actually get paid—and keep the good vibes going. You can set your royalty percentage when minting an NFT—usually between 2.5% and 10% of every resale. Not all marketplaces play by the same rules. Hot tip: Check the fine print (or community chatter) before committing to any platform. Some newer “zero-fee” platforms are also “zero-royalty,” which isn't great if you're counting on long-term income. Royalties are one piece of the puzzle—but your creativity? With these tips in your digital toolkit, you'll be better equipped to build a royalty strategy that's fair, future-proof, and financially sane. Next up: let's peek into what the future holds for NFT royalties. NFT royalties have opened up an exciting new world where artists and creators can finally earn from their work long after the first sale. The idea of passive income sounds amazing—who wouldn't want to keep making money every time their art changes hands? That doesn't mean creators should ignore them—far from it. Royalties are still a powerful tool in the digital creator's kit. Just don't treat them as a guaranteed income stream. Think of them as one ingredient in a bigger recipe. If you're smart about platforms, fair with your royalty rates, and open to multiple income sources, NFT royalties can absolutely work in your favor—just maybe not forever on their own.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A sharp pullback characterized the broader cryptocurrency market on Thursday, leading to a bearish pattern break in Bitcoin (BTC) to briefly test the $100k levels. The market-wide panic with the Bitcoin sell-off led to quick profit bookings in altcoins such as Lido DAO (LDO), Jupiter (JUP), and Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET). The price action shows BTC breaking out of a Head-and-Shoulders pattern with a neckline near $102,250, as shared in the chart below. LDO takes a breather after the 14% drop on Thursday, with no significant price movement at press time in early Asian hours. Lido DAO falls under the $0.80 level but avoids a closing below May's low at $0.741. Completing a falling wedge with the support trendline, swing highs in LDO on January 31, May 13, and June 4 give rise to a converging resistance trendline. Sideline investors looking to sell can find entry opportunities in such a case, with the price target at $0.630, the lowest daily close since July 2022. Similar to Bitcoin, Jupiter price action reveals a Head-and-Shoulders pattern breakout triggered by an 11.70% drop on Thursday. However, a reversal in JUP closing above the broken neckline at $0.4764 could propel it to the 50-day EMA at $0.5139. FET evaporates the early week gains with two consecutive bearish days and is down nearly 5% so far this week. Similar to other altcoins, the MACD indicator is characterized by rising red histograms and a downward trajectory of average lines in the negative territory. However, a slip below $0.70 could push FET down to the $0.50 psychological level. Information on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), a Solana-based meme coin boasting a market capitalization of slightly over $1 billion, is extending its gains, trading at around $1.08 at the time of writing on Friday. The cryptocurrency market capitalization drops 4% to $3.3 trillion amid growing concerns about tariffs and global trade. Bitcoin rebounds after testing support slightly above $100,000, reflecting weak sentiment in the broader crypto market.
