Djokovic is chasing more tennis history at Roland Garros but World No 1 Sinner stands in his way Novak Djokovic faces World No 1 Jannik Sinner in the French Open semi-finals and for a spot in Sunday's title match against defending champion Carlos Alcaraz. Djokovic, 38, is bidding to become the oldest male grand slam champion in the Open era and said there is “no bigger occasion” for him that taking on the World No 1 in a major semi-final at Roland Garros. The 24-time grand slam winner proved he can still compete with the best after outclassing third seed Alexander Zverev in the quarter-finals but Sinner, the reigning US Open and Australian Open champion, has beaten Djokovic in their last three meetings. Earlier, Alcaraz fought back after dropping the first set to Lorenzo Musetti to book his place in the final for a second successive year. The Spaniard had taken a crucial second-set tie-break before Musetti began to struggle physically, with the Italian losing eight straight games before withdrawing early in the fourth set. Follow live updates and scores from the French Open below: He's starting to twinge in his leg but is giving this a real go. The point takes him to 15-30 and he unloads on a second serve to win his first break point of the match. That doesn't last as Sinner forces him across the baseline. He needs a second attempt at an overhead smash to get the winner though which shows how quick and responsive Sinner is across the clay. He holds but now must break or else Sinner is taking the second set. Djokovic is trying but he's finding it difficult to inflict blows on Jannik Sinner. He can't live up to it. Once again Novak Djokovic is drawn into a prolonged battle to hold his own serve. Slight margins such as the pace of his serve or the placement of a sliced backhand are going either for him or against him. Sinner pushes Djokovic so far behind the baseline that he can scoop a drop shot over the net. Djokovic comes flying forward but can't get there in time and the point goes to him. It sets up a break point rally which shows the task Djokovic faces. Sinner comes up to the net and plays a drop shot, Djokovic's attempted lob isn't good and Sinner knocks it back. Djokovic replys with a backhand but Sinner is already back to the baseline and fizzes his return over. Novak Djokovic hasn't had a break point against Jannik Sinner in their last two meetings and hasn't had one in this match either. He's 15-30 up in this game but Sinner pings down another venomous serve which Djokovic lofts over the back. Sinner then flies through the next two points. Things are tough for Djokovic out there. A rally of thunderous backhands goes Sinners way after he checks a cross court shot and drills it straight instead. At advantage, he comes up to the net and wins with an overhead volley. Before this match began it was expected to be a close affair. Perhaps the biggest question was how a 38-year-old Novak Djokovic would cope against his younger opponent. At 30-30, on his own serve, he scoops a forehand, barely knee high, into the tape and gifts up a break point opportunity. Djokovic then leaps into another forehand in the next rally and forces an error from Sinner to reach deuce. He yells in triumph and gets a reaction from the crowd. Sinner miscues a sliced backhand into the net and advantage goes to Djokovic. This match has ramped up in skill. A backhand goes wide and another error puts Sinner into the lead at 30-15. But, a precise forehand drilled quickly down the line putd Djokovic back on level terms and there's a chance to force break points... Sinner fires down two aggressive serves and goes on to hold. Djokovic holds to love, which will be welcome because he was doubling over between points in the last game. He stands and roars to the crowd. Djokovic is throwing everything he has at Sinner, but Sinner is replying by sending back so much pace, and he's not missing anything. An epic game, and still no break point for Djokovic. But that was the closest he had been. Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a rematch of last year's Olympic gold-medal final, Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini dismissed Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider to reach their second straight Roland Garros doubles final. They will face Anna Danilina and Aleksandra Krunic for the title on Sunday. In a rematch of last summer's Olympic gold-medal final, Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini won again and returned to the Roland Garros women's doubles final. 2-seeded Italians Errani and Paolini reached the French Open doubles championship match for the second straight year after dismissing No. 4 seeds Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider 6-0, 6-1 on Friday. "We did, I think, a perfect match," Errani said afterwards. "Didn't miss many balls today, and we played really good. Errani and Paolini needed to fight back from a set down to take the gold medal from Andreeva and Shnaider at last year's Paris Olympics -- which was also held at Roland Garros. This time around, though, Errani and Paolini dominated play from the start, and they needed only 61 minutes to prevail on Court Simonne-Mathieu. In Friday's match, though, Errani and Paolini never faced a break point. The Italians will now try to go one better in Paris than they did last year. They fell to Coco Gauff and Katerina Siniakova in last year's Roland Garros women's doubles final. Despite Errani and Paolini's proficiency on tour as a team over the last year -- they have won four WTA 1000 titles to go along with their gold medal -- they have not yet won a Grand Slam title as a duo. Along with her Roland Garros doubles final, Paolini also reached two Slam finals in singles last year, but was unable to convert any of them into a title. Errani, though, has a Career Grand Slam in women's doubles. The 38-year-old won all four majors alongside Roberta Vinci between 2012 and 2014. Errani has also won two mixed doubles Slams with another Italian, Andrea Vavassori. The first came at last year's US Open. Errani and Paolini will take on Anna Danilina of Kazakhstan and Aleksandra Krunic of Serbia in Sunday's final. At 5-5, 30-30 in the third set, Danilina carved an overhead with so much spin that it left Eikeri chasing down the surprisingly short ball to no avail. Krunic polished off that game with a winning volley to break for 6-5. This is Danilina and Krunic's first event as a pairing since 2022. Technically, the team has now reached consecutive finals -- before this tournament, their most recent result together was a runner-up finish at 2022 Cleveland. Nearly three years later, they picked up where they left off, and posted a huge upset in the quarterfinals by beating No. Now Danilina and Krunic are back into another championship match, and it is Krunic's first trip into a Grand Slam final, in any discipline. Danilina has previous Grand Slam final experience, including a title. In a rematch of last year's Olympic gold-medal final, Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini dismissed Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider to reach their second straight Roland Garros doubles final. They will face Anna Danilina and Aleksandra Krunic for the title on Sunday.</p>

Tall, talented and unapologetically passionate, Stefanos Tsitsipas has become one of the most intriguing figures in modern tennis. With a fearless game and an even bolder personality, he's carved a path unlike any other on the ATP Tour. The Greek star rose from junior prodigy to Grand Slam contender in just a few seasons, drawing attention not only for his shot-making flair but also for his philosophical musings and on-court fire. His performances have electrified crowds and sometimes sparked controversy. Beyond the tennis courts, his story is layered: family ties to tennis and a social media presence that's as unpredictable as his one-handed backhand. Born on August 12, 1998, in Athens, Greece, Stefanos Tsitsipas is currently 26 years old. He turned professional in 2016 and quickly ascended the ATP rankings, becoming one of the most prominent figures in men's tennis. Standing at 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 meters), Stefanos Tsitsipas combines his height with agility, making him a formidable opponent. Stefanos Tsitsipas and Spanish tennis star Paula Badosa have become one of the most followed couples on the professional tennis circuit. Their relationship began publicly in June 2023, when they posted a series of affectionate photos. This sparked a wave of speculation and concern from fans. Yet just weeks later, they were spotted together again in Monte Carlo, and both confirmed their reconciliation during press conferences. Born into a family immersed in tennis, Stefanos had no shortage of inspiration. His mother, Julia Apostoli, is a former WTA professional who represented the Soviet Union and later Greece. His father, Apostolos Tsitsipas, is a Greek tennis coach who studied sports science at the University of Athens and took the lead in developing his game from childhood. His brother, Petros Tsitsipas, is also a tennis player, though primarily focused on doubles. The Tsitsipas family often travels together, and their tight-knit bond has always been visible on tour. For years, Apostolos Tsitsipas—Stefanos' father—was a constant figure in his coaching box, guiding him through juniors to the professional spotlight. However, as he matured, so did his need for tactical independence. In early 2025, he made the tough and emotional decision to part ways with his father as coach, stating in interviews that he wanted “a father, not a coach” at that point in his career. In a strategic move, he brought in Goran Ivanisevic, the former Wimbledon champion and ex-coach of Novak Djokovic, to help refine his game. Since joining forces, he has already shown improved consistency and mental resilience, which was evident in his 2025 title run in Dubai.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lorenzo Musetti's dream run at Roland Garros came to an end on Friday when he was forced to retire against defending champion Carlos Alcaraz due to an upper left leg injury. “I'm really sad and disappointed how it ended, but still a great match,” said Musetti. “I felt at the beginning of the third when I was serving, I started losing a little bit of strength on the left leg behind, and definitely was going worse and worse, so I decided to stop. “I think it was the right decision to make, even if it was not what I wanted.

But he was unable to continue, with Alcaraz leading 4-6, 7-6(3), 6-0, 2-0 when the Italian retired. Having now lost each of the past three meetings with Alcaraz, all of which have come on clay this year, Musetti now trails 1-6 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Of course I had to play probably my best level of the tournament to stay there with him,” Musetti said. “I maintained the high level that we showed for two hours or whatever. I felt that today I had my chances to even try to go two sets up, but of course Carlos, he's playing really well. Despite the bitter nature of his exit in Paris, Musetti can look back on a remarkable campaign on European clay. He became just the fifth player in history to reach the semi-finals at all clay ATP Masters 1000 events and Roland Garros in one season. Musetti departs Paris with a 19-4 record on clay this year, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. “I knew even before stepping on court that I had to play probably the best match of my career so far,” said Musetti. “For part of it, I was doing a great job and I was there physically, technically, mentally. Sometimes he wanted to be really aggressive, especially on the return side, and I served really good today. “At the end if I have to analyse those two sets, they were really, really great sets. Of course the third one and the last two games, there was of course no chance to play at his level with this problem. So it was an unlucky situation, but I think in the end he probably had more than me.” Musetti, who will leave the French capital up one spot to a career-high No. 6 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, is able to look ahead with confidence approaching the grass-court swing.

If you want to catch every match of the French Open and don't currently subscribe to HBO Max or a live TV streaming service, in Australia a majority of the action is streaming free with ads on 9Now, and in Austria it's all streaming free with ads on ServusTV. Don't live in either of those places? A VPN (virtual private network) helps protect your data, can mask your IP address and is perhaps most popular for being especially useful in the age of streaming. Whether you're looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to next F1 race without a cable package, a VPN can help you out. Looking to try a VPN for the first time? This guide breaks down the best VPN options for every kind of user. ExpressVPN offers “internet without borders,” meaning you can tune into an Austrian or Australian livestream this month as opposed to paying for another streaming subscription. All you'll need to do is sign up for ExpressVPN, change your server location and then find free livestream coverage on 9Now or ServusTV.

Carlos Alcaraz benefited from the abandonment of Lorenzo Musetti (4-6, 7-6 (3), 6-0, 2-0) on Friday afternoon and will face the winner of the match between Italian Jannik Sinner, the top seed, and Serb Novak Djokovic, the No 6 seed, for the title

Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, the second seed, moved into the final of Roland-Garros when Italian Lorenzo Musetti, the No 8 seed, retired at Roland-Garros in Paris on Friday afternoon.

Alcaraz, ranked No 2, led 4-6, 7-6 (3), 6-0, 2-0 when Musetti, ranked No 7, pulled out on Friday at Roland-Garros in Paris.

The 22-year-old Spaniard will play the winner of the match between Italian Jannik Sinner, the top seed, and Serb Novak Djokovic, the No 6 seed, next.

Carlos Alcaraz won against Italian qualifier Giulio Zeppieri (6-3, 6-4, 6-2), Hungarian Fabian Marozsan (6-1, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2), Bosnian Damir Dzumhur (6-1, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4), American Ben Shelton, the No 13 seed (7-6 (8), 6-3, 4-6, 6-4) and American Tommy Paul, the No 12 seed (6-0, 6-1, 6-4) earlier in the tournament.

In the previous rounds of the Roland-Garros 2025, the Italian beat German qualifier Yannick Hanfmann (7-5, 6-2, 6-0), Colombian lucky loser Daniel Elahi Galan (6-4, 6-0, 6-4), Argentinian Mariano Navone (4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2), Dane Holger Rune, the No 10 seed (7-5, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2) and American Frances Tiafoe, the No 15 seed (6-2, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>1 Aryna Sabalenka came through a battle against four-time winner and defending champion Iga Świątek to make the women's final where she will face American star Coco Gauff, who ended Lois Boisson's Cinderella story. Meanwhile, in the men's draw, Carlos Alcaraz defeated Italian star Lorenzo Musetti to make it to the final, while 24-time grand slam champion Novak Djokovic is set to clash with world No. Here's everything you need to know about one of the world's oldest tennis tournaments: Starting out as the “French Clay-Court Championships” in 1891 – allowing only players from France to compete – the French Open was officially created in 1925 when foreign players were first invited. In 1927, a new arena was purpose built for France's defense of its 1927 Davis Cup title and named after Roland Garros – not a sportsman, but a pioneering French aviator who was killed in World War I. But are the courts really made of clay? Clay makes up just a small part of the tennis court, with 1-2 millimeters of crushed red bricks giving them their famous red hue. Grueling five-set matches on clay can push players close to their physical limits. Related video Roland Garros: Why is clay the most difficult surface to play on? Matches on clay are also sometimes referred to as chess matches, where a well-placed shot can set up a winner two or three shots later. Clay also has considerably more friction than grass or hard courts, allowing the ball to grip to the dust and bounce much higher, in particular shots with heavy topspin. Even for a player as accomplished as Novak Djokovic, one of the sport's all-time greats, clay continues to be a tricky surface to master. “It's a very demanding surface,” Djokovic said after recently winning his first clay court match since completing the “Golden Slam” at the Paris Olympics. While Roland Garros is considered the pinnacle of the clay season, there are many other ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) and WTA (Women's Tennis Association) tournaments played on the red dust. This year, there are 18 tournaments scheduled to be played on clay in the ATP Tour, while the women will play 11 clay court tournaments in 2025. But hard court is still the most popular surface on both tours in 2025. Hard court is also favored by US players as most of the American tournaments are played on that surface. While some smaller tournaments pay the male winner more than female players, all four grand slams offer equal prize money. The US Open was the first to award both tournament winners equal money in 1973 – something championed by Billie Jean King. The Australian Open followed suit 11 years later, offering men and women equal pay but reverted to paying men more in 1996. In November 2024, the “King of Clay” played his final match of professional tennis when Spain lost in the Davis Cup. With 22 grand slams in his pocket – including a record 14 French Opens – we look at the new generation of tennis players who perform well on the red stuff. Will we ever see someone match Nadal's achievements on clay? This year, Olympic gold medalist Zheng Qinwen modeled a unique calf-length pleated skirt – inspired by Suzanne Lenglen's iconic style – though she said she is “too shy” to wear it on the court. Related article ‘I didn't know it would cause such a stir': Serena Williams reveals how catsuit became an iconic fashion moment However, the most famous of all the Roland Garros outfits has to be Serena Williams' superhero-esque ‘catsuit' she wore in 2018 just months after giving birth to her first child. The glitz and glamor of the tournament also draws celebrities from all walks of life, with singer/producer/composer Pharrell Williams, actor Ben Stiller and three-time Formula One world drivers champion Jackie Stewart among those in attendance last year. We are guaranteed to see a brand new winner of the women's title – who will see their name etched in history this weekend: Sabalenka or Gauff? In the men's draw, can Alcaraz become the first man to go back-to-back since his idol Nadal in 2020, will Sinner win his first French Open or will Djokovic further extend his grand slam record?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner, left, of Italy is congratulated by Novak Djokovic of Serbia following their semifinal at the Australian Open tennis championships at Melbourne Park, Melbourne, Australia, Friday, Jan. 26, 2024. They'll have a shot of breaking that tie in the French Open semifinal Friday at 1 p.m. Sinner vs. Djokovic will air nationally on TNT, and can be streamed live on DirecTV (free trial). Channel Finder: DirecTV, Verizon Fios, Cox, Xfinity, Spectrum, Optimum Here's a recent tennis story from the Associated Press: PARIS (AP) — A crucial moment arrived more than 2 1/2 hours into Novak Djokovic's 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 French Open quarterfinal victory over Alexander Zverev. It was the fourth set, and Djokovic led, but Zverev was in possession of a break point and a chance to get back into Wednesday's match. He stayed in place afterward, breathing heavily, with hands on hips, scanning the standing ovation from thousands of Court Philippe-Chatrier spectators. He soon held serve for a 4-2 lead in that set and was back on track. He might have slogged through a pair of three-match losing skids this season and slid to No. What hasn't changed is Djokovic's determination or his ability to be his best on big stages — and now he's two wins from a record 25th Grand Slam title. Djokovic is pleased to show himself, and others, he's still got it “It's a proven kind of testament to myself that I can — and to others that I can — still play on the highest level.” Earlier Wednesday, Sinner continued his overpowering run through the bracket by dismissing Alexander Bublik 6-1, 7-5, 6-0. Sinner not only hasn't dropped a set so far, but he has ceded a total of only 36 games through five matches. They are tied 4-4 head-to-head; Sinner won the last three matchups. No one has won more major championships or reached more major semifinals than his total that now stands at 51 after becoming the second-oldest man to get that far in Paris. He also just claimed his 100th career tournament title, a week before the French Open. “I just hope that I will be able to physically keep up with Sinner in few days' time,” Djokovic said. Sinner, 23, has won three of the past five Grand Slam titles. Also an apt description for Djokovic, who repeatedly used drop shots to great effect against Zverev. As for Sinner, no one other than Carlos Alcaraz has been able to beat him in his last 48 matches, a stretch that dates to last August. Sinner is 46-2 in that span, with both defeats coming against the French Open's defending champion. Djokovic and Zverev were both bothered by bugs during their match There were some distractions in Djokovic vs. Zverev, including a bunch of tiny flying insects that the players kept trying to swat away and a back-and-forth between the chair umpire and some fans in the fourth set. Needless to say, Djokovic handled it all much better. He was broken in the very first game — and then not again. He broke Zverev four times — no small feat against a guy broken a total of five times in his five previous matches. “What do you want me to say? He's won 24 of these things,” Zverev said. The last time these two played each other was in the Australian Open semifinals in January, and Djokovic had to quit after one set because of an injured hamstring. He sure looks in good shape at the moment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>19:02 CET - We are just minutes away from the second French Open semi-final of the day between world No. 1 Jannik Sinner and 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic. 17:07 CET - Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz is back into the French Open final after Lorenzo Musetti retired from their semi-final, trailing 6-4, 6-7(3), 6-0, 2-0. The Italian appeared to be struggling with a thigh injury towards the end, and is unable to continue. His fine clay-court season comes to a disappointing close. Meanwhile, Alcaraz now stands on the verge of a fifth Grand Slam title and his second here, but he will certainly have to be better against either Jannik Sinner or Novak Djokovic in the final. The Spaniard was well off his best in the first two sets, playing inpatience tennis and making several errors. 16:58 CET - Carlos Alcaraz has found top gear now, and has soared ahead to take the third set 6-0 against a Lorenzo Musetti who appears to be tiring. 16:34 CET - It hasn't been vintage stuff at all from Carlos Alcaraz at Roland Garros, and he is making plenty of errors, but he has still managed to find a way to snatch the second set 7-6(3), and level proceedings against Lorenzo Musetti. When it really mattered, the Spaniard upped his game in the tiebreak, against an opponent who is playing extremely well. A solid set for the Italian to win it, with a solid serve and good play at the net. Up first at 14:30 CET, defending champion Carlos Alcaraz takes on Lorenzo Musetti, who has enjoyed a stunning clay-court season, reaching at least the semi-finals at every event. However, the Italian is playing the best tennis of his career and will be targeting an upset. That will be followed by a massive meeting between world number one Jannik Sinner and three-time French Open champion Novak Djokovic. He has done a remarkable job getting to the semi-finals at 38 years old and with not much form this season, but will this be a step too far? However, write off the legendary Serb at your peril, and he will certainly have a plan for Sinner. Sinner has been utterly relentless this tournament, not yet dropping a set and swatting aside all his opponents with ease. But this will certainly be his biggest test, and if he is slightly off his best, Djokovic will do everything to make him pay.</p>

Catch all the US Open tennis action at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York City. One of the city's many major moments each year – the US Open Tennis Championships – takes place in Queens for two weeks on either side of Labor Day. It's a spectacle I've been lucky enough to attend for several years, and I promise that despite the price tag, few marquee experiences are as rewarding. The US Open is a fortnight of Grand Slam tennis in the city that never sleeps and is one of the most vibrant and visceral sporting events on Earth. Where else can you watch matches into the wee hours of the morning alongside bonafide movie stars and bigwigs, with a boisterous and vocal crowd that hangs on every point? Even if you don't normally watch tennis, attending the US Open is an energizing experience. Here's everything you need to know about New York's Grand Slam tournament. The tournament takes place from late August to early September, and 2025 is the first year with a Sunday start, on August 24, allowing tennis fans to see first-round action without having to take a day off work. The matches go on for two weeks, day and night, culminating in the finals on September 6 and 7. All events take place at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, New York. Tickets to the US Open cost a lot of money. And all the sessions sell out almost immediately after going on sale, leaving only marked-up resale tickets on Ticketmaster. I won't say there's no way to get non-resale, face-value tickets – but that has been my experience. Other online ticket vendors, such as SeatGeek and StubHub, also offer resale tickets. It's best to shop around, and definitely make sure any ticket vendor guarantees the veracity and existence of the tickets. To give an idea of prices, a first-round grounds pass for the day session (which means you can access outer courts and smaller stadiums on a first-come-first-serve basis) is currently hovering around $350 (originally selling for $175), but prices can, though rarely do, fluctuate. What's worse is that after you pony up double what tickets originally cost, you'll see an ungodly abundance of empty seats, especially in the early rounds. If money is no object, check out On Location, which specializes in hospitality offerings, such as individual courtside seats and access to a luxury box. While there are no matches, you can catch Carlos Alcaraz, Jessica Pegula, Ben Shelton, Iga Świątek and all the big-name star players practicing on all the courts. I prefer day sessions during the early rounds, and I recommend arriving early because lines can be long. Few options are more convenient than hotels near Flushing, Queens. Alternatively, you can stay in Manhattan and commute via subway. Airbnb and short-term rentals have been all but outlawed (unless the host is there), so hotels or crashing with friends or family are your best bet. I usually suggest the NH Collection near Grand Central Station to people who come in from out of town. It's a generally affordable, convenient, well-appointed 4-star hotel that isn't on many travelers' radars. Rooms hover around $300–400 per night, for two nights early in the tournament. That may sound pricey, but by Manhattan standards it's a good deal. For something more unique, NYC has some charming B&Bs, including the Black-owned Akwaaba Mansion in Brooklyn, that can give you a taste of local life as well as a memorable, personalized stay. But real New Yorkers take the 7 train to Mets-Willets Point (Citi Field is here, too) to get to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows. From Grand Central Station, it takes about 45 minutes and a short walk over a pedestrian bridge will bring you to the entrance. Stuff all of it into your pockets if possible, and if you need to bring a bag (no backpacks), you may have to put up with a longer line for it to go through the security screening – bags need to be small (12” W x 12” H x 16” L). There are so many wonderful things to eat and drink at the Open, and it's all pretty pricey (nothing about tennis is cheap). They change up the purveyors every year, but they're all local: try a Fuku fried chicken sandwich, a lobster roll from Red Hook Lobster Pound, or cool off with some Van Leeuwen Ice Cream (the affogato cream is my favorite). If you're a drinker, you must order a Honey Deuce, the tournament's signature cocktail made with Grey Goose vodka, lemonade, raspberry liqueur and a spear of three tennisy melon balls,  served in a commemorative plastic cup – it's the perfect souvenir. Chase cardholders can borrow mobile phone chargers, and American Express cardholders get portable radios that wrap around your ear, so you can hear the televised commentary. It can be difficult to navigate, so get your bearings before you arrive, download the US Open app with the grounds map and decide what matches you want to see and the courts on which they'll be played. You can only enter certain courts at certain intervals during each match, so don't get frustrated if you're held back from entering. This is how I watched Serina Williams' final professional match, along with a large crowd of fans, and it is one of my favorite moments of any tournament I've ever attended.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner, left, of Italy is congratulated by Novak Djokovic of Serbia following their semifinal at the Australian Open tennis championships at Melbourne Park, Melbourne, Australia, Friday, Jan. 26, 2024. Novak Djokovic looks to stay in the running for a record 25th Grand Slam title with a semifinal battle looming Friday at the 2025 French Open. The match is scheduled to start at 1 p.m. 1 ranking and is on a head-to-head hot streak with Djokovic, having beaten him in four of their past five meetings. Friday's semifinal will be their first meeting of the 2025 season, during which Sinner won his second straight Grand Slam tournament at the Australian Open. The 23-year-old Italian has yet to win the French Open and could make personal history if he beats Djokovic to make his first career final. Djokovic had to survive a major test in No. Djokovic had his bid for a second straight Roland Garros title cut short last year when he had to retire due to injury. Djokovic and Sinner are set for a 1 p.m. Live streams are available from DirecTV (free trial) and SlingTV (low intro rate).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three years ago at Roland-Garros , Gauff was making her debut on that sort of stage and with that sort of prize at stake. It felt like the outcome meant absolutely everything, a burden that was a lot at the time and made her nervous. “Everybody is dealing with way bigger things in life than losing a final,” the American said after beating 361st-ranked French wild-card entry Loïs Boisson 6-1, 6-2 in the semifinals Thursday. “I'm sure there are hundreds of players that would kill to win or lose a final, so just knowing that (makes) me realize how lucky and privileged I am to be in this position,” Gauff said. Here's another key difference: The Gauff of today is a Grand Slam champion. She won the 2023 U.S. Open ; her opponent in that final just so happened to be Sabalenka. Their head-to-head series is tied 5-5 entering the first No. Sabalenka beat Gauff in their most recent meeting, which came at the Madrid Open in May on the type of red clay used at Roland-Garros. So Gauff is well aware of Sabalenka's many talents, which were on full display during a 7-6 (1), 4-6, 6-0 semifinal victory over three-time defending champion Iga Swiatek . “She can come up with some big shots and big winners pretty much at all areas of the court,” Gauff said about the 27-year-old from Belarus. After getting pushed to a third set by Swiatek, who had won 26 matches in a row at the French Open, Sabalenka was pretty much perfect down the stretch. Even Sabalenka called the lopsided nature of that last set “shocking for me.” She didn't make a single unforced error; Swiatek had 12. “It was just hard to get into any rally.” Sabalenka took over the top ranking from Swiatek last October and has remained there. Sabalenka is 40-6 this season with three titles and, while her three major championships all came on hard courts — at the 2023 and 2024 Australian Opens and the 2024 U.S. Open — the work she's put in to improve on clay is clearly paying off. I can go back and play in defense,” Sabalenka said. Her high-risk style offers a contrast to Gauff, who has been making an effort to be more aggressive with her forehand but usually is at her best when she is making opponents hit shot after shot because she can get to everything with her speed, instincts and defense. “She's going to come out swinging,” Gauff said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Serena Williams had many outstanding moments during her storied tennis career. But the American superstar singles out winning a Grand Slam while pregnant as probably her most astonishing achievement. “I don't know how I did that, honestly,” Williams said on Wednesday (6 June) at the SuperReturn private equity conference in Berlin, Germany. I do remember not being able to run for a long time.” She beat her sister Venus in that epic final. “I didn't tell anyone,” continued Williams, who retired from professional in 2022 after a 27-year career. “I mean, Venus knew, and I still feel really bad about that, because a deep part of me feels like because we played each other in the final, I'm like, she must have known, and she must have felt some sort of deep heaviness to go even further and go all out. But she was only one of two people that knew.” And I'm like, how does she not see that I'm not able to breathe right now, and so I just intentionally lost the next point just to kind of try and get my energy back. Williams was speaking in Berlin to private equity professionals as the owner of Serena Ventures, a venture capital firm she runs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some fans were hoping to see Murray form a dream team with Emma Raducanu but that looks to be unlikely ahead of this year's Championships with Mark Petchey set for a bigger role during the 2025 grass-court swing. Three-time major winner Murray has previously named Raducanu as a player he'd love to coach one day along with British No.1 Jack Draper, Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz and Greek star Stefanos Tsitsipas. But his mother Judy doesn't think her son is ‘ready to jump straight back into coaching' and suggested he may take some time away from tennis. ‘Andy had just retired and wasn't looking to go into coaching but he stepped in because Novak asked him,' she told The Herald. ‘When they joined-up, I was certainly interested to see how he got on being on the other side of things and realising how stressful it can be. Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic's six-month partnership ended in May (Picture: Getty) Djokovic had been in poor form all season ahead of the French Open, which is currently ongoing, and it seems he made the change to boost his chances of a strong performance at Roland-Garros. ‘I don't think he's ready to jump straight back into coaching, though, because the tennis circuit is relentless. ‘I can see him doing a consultant type role with young players and he's already done a lot of mentoring with the British players on the men's side who are coming through but I can't see him being a full-time tennis coach. ‘There's more to life than jumping straight back into the tennis rat race after nearly 20 years as a player. ‘Whether he does it in the future, I don't know – that's for him to answer and I actually don't think he knows the answer either but my guess is not right now.' The former world No.1 tennis star signed his first golf equipment deal earlier this year, becoming a brand ambassador for Callaway.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jim Courier enjoyed a legendary tennis career, reaching world number one and winning multiple Grand Slam titles. Retiring in 2000, Courier began working as a commentator shortly after, sharing his opinions on the sport with fans around the world. He did just that during Novak Djokovic's win over Alexander Zverev on Wednesday night, as the American selected the greatest single game of tennis he'd ever seen. During his commentary of Djokovic's quarterfinal win at the 2025 French Open, Courier named the greatest game of tennis he'd seen. “We shouldn't really be surprised that we've seen some of the most breathtaking single points between these two players,” he said. “He would win it in five sets, but I've never seen a game that competitive before or since. On set point at *4-5, 15-40, Zverev and Djokovic battled it out in one of the greatest points of Grand Slam tennis you will ever see. It was going to be tough to top that, but Zverev and Djokovic certainly came close during their French Open quarterfinal match. Down break point in the fourth set against Zverev, Djokovic proved why many consider him to be the greatest of all time. After 38 brutal shots, Djokovic hit a beautiful drop shot which his German rival did well to retrieve. Zverev's return gave Djokovic a great chance to hit a forehand, an opportunity he grasped as he saved the break point. Commentator John McEnroe couldn't quite believe what he'd seen. “I've got goosebumps just watching these two dig deep right there,” he said. “41-shot rally that had pretty much everything, and on break point.” “Unreal, mind-boggling, jaw-dropping 41-shot rally to save a break point,” added another. Djokovic with that 41-shot rally to save break point. “Djokovic with that 41-shot rally to save a break point. “That 41-shot rally shows why tennis is pure art. Not just about power, it's footwork, stamina, and pure grit. Djokovic's mental toughness in these marathon points is what separates champions from contenders,” said one fan on X. Djokovic went on to win the match in four sets, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4, booking his place in the semi-finals where he'll take on Jannik Sinner. Sinner and Djokovic will face off for a place in the French Open final on Friday, June 6.</p>
