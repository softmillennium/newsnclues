            When friends Neon and Zane started a campaign to stop Tesla from building a battery recycling factory on a small block in their local area, they suspected that strong views about the company's billionaire boss might help sway local opinion.
    


            But they had no idea how much, or how far, anti-Elon Musk sentiment had spread beyond the epicenter of his influence in the United States, where until recently he caused chaos in federal workplaces as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency.
    


            Neon and Zane, who asked to use aliases to avoid doxxing by Musk supporters, say the main aim of their campaign, “Trees Not Teslas,” was to preserve about 60 trees on the site, in Tonsley, an area south of Adelaide, Australia's driest state capital.
    


            “We're struggling for designated green spaces … and it's just an insult to try and take away the one bit that's left within the Tonsley area,” said Neon, who used to live near the site and still works in the vicinity.
    


            When the local council published the results of its community consultation on the proposal, which allows the land to be sold for redevelopment, it contained hundreds of inflammatory anti-Musk comments or outright slurs. A search showed 229 references to “Nazi,” “Nazism” or other, similar phrases, to give an indication of the tone.
    


            With his high profile, confrontational statements and postings on social media, Musk has become a lightning rod for people across America and around the world opposed to the policies of US President Donald Trump's administration.
    


            The Tesla CEO is now engaged in a very public bust-up with Trump, that's unfolding in real-time on rival social media platforms, watched by a global audience.
    


            Musk's former close partnership with Trump took a toll on Tesla sales. Global deliveries plunged 13% in the first three months of this year, the largest drop in its history, as backlash against Musk and growing competition took a bite out of demand for its vehicles.
    


            Of the proposed factory in Tonsley, a suburb managed by the Marion Council, one comment from the public consultation said: “You and I both know it's getting torched every few months because of the Nazi implications. You really want that bought (sic) up every single meeting?”
    


            Some respondents referred directly to the arm gesture Musk gave in January at Trump's post-inauguration rally that commentators likened to a fascist salute. At the time, Musk wrote on his social media platform X: “The ‘everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired.”
    


            But the memory appeared to stick with Tonsley residents and a staggering 95% of over 900 replies to the council survey rejected its plans to prepare the land for sale. However, Marion Council passed it anyway and sent it to the state government for approval.
    


            CNN has reached out to Tesla for comment.
    


            It may seem unusual that residents in a small Australian city might have issues with Musk, given their distance from his policies and decisions. And it's especially unusual given South Australia's past positive experience with the billionaire entrepreneur.
    


            In 2017, Musk offered to build the world's most powerful battery to solve some of the state's power woes within 100 days, or it would be free. And he did. South Australia is now leading the country in terms of renewable energy and is on track to hit its target of 100% net renewables by 2027.
    


            Backed by the state government, Tesla and a local power company have created a virtual power plant fitting Powerwall battery systems on homes across the state. The idea is that all the batteries would band together to support the grid in times of high demand.
    


            However, the proposed Tesla plant in Marion would not generate any power – it would be used to recycle Tesla batteries and provide a showroom for Tesla's electric vehicles (EV), sales of which have fallen in Australia.
    


            Figures from the Electric Vehicle Council show Tesla sales nationwide nearly halved in the year to May 2025. Felipe Munoz, senior analyst at auto market research firm JATO Dynamics, says that's partly due to the wait for the Model Y. It finally arrived in Australia in May, sending Tesla sales soaring 122% last month compared with the same period a year ago.
    


            Marion Council Mayor Kris Hanna says anti-Musk sentiment had intruded on a standard council consultation, which was simply about finding a use for contaminated land “that will probably never be a recreational space again.”
    


            The site is contaminated by trichloroethylene, known as TCE, a solvent that can cause cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma and is banned in the United States.
    


            “The problem with that is, not only, for example, children playing in the dirt, but also the fumes which can rise up from underneath the earth. Sealing it with a bitumen car park or a building is a solution,” said Hanna.
    


            The site has been fenced off from the public since 2016. The locals say that, even if they can't use it, the mature trees offer a refuge for birdlife in an area almost devoid of tree canopy. More importantly, according to the Conservation Council of South Australia, the mature trees are helping to contain the contamination.
    


            “The removal of trees puts that site at greater risk of the leakage of those contaminants into the groundwater and obviously then impacting on human health more broadly,” said Kirsty Bevan, the group's CEO, who added Tesla's promises to plant 59 saplings on the site weren't good enough.
    


            “We are proposing that further research needs to be undertaken at that site, and remedial measures need to be put in place,” she said. “I think that the site improvements we're looking for would come with a forest of trees.”
    


            Of the anti-Musk campaign, Bevan said: “I don't let my personal opinions of people I've never met before interfere with being a voice for nature.”
    


            Hanna, the mayor, said councilors heard the opposition but voted 8-3 to pass the proposal because it would create 100 jobs, a “huge number” for the area. A new business would also pay local taxes, easing the burden on residents during a cost-of-living crisis, Hanna said.
    


            “To have a substantial new factory come into the area is very significant, and it's adjacent to a high-tech manufacturing area, which we developed in the place of an old car plant. So, it actually fits in very well to have a factory that recycles electric batteries,” Hanna said.
    


            One of the dissenting councilors, Sarah Luscombe, said she voted against the proposal because the community had sent clear and consistent feedback that they wanted more trees, and the council's own strategic vision is for a “livable, sustainable community.”
    


            “The people that I've spoken to in the community are just sick and tired of seeing their interests overshadowed by those of large corporations,” Luscombe said. “More and more, we're seeing communities just saying, ‘Well, hang on, I do want to have a say here, and I do want my views to be counted.'”
    


            In recent months, Tesla cars and showrooms have been vandalized in multiple countries by critics venting their anger over Musk's support of far-right parties in Europe, and other policies.
    


            Hanna said the council had received “vitriolic correspondence” since approving the proposal, but he wasn't concerned about a violent backlash against the Tesla factory or council members and wouldn't be drawn on his own views on Musk.
    


            “I'm speaking as a mayor, and I don't actually take any political or ideological stance,” he said. “I just try and make life beautiful for the people in my area.”
    


            South Australian Local Government Minister Joe Szakacs told CNN in a statement that he will follow the “usual process” to determine if the land should be approved for sale.
    


            “Our Government welcomes investment and job creation in South Australia and is proud of its commitment to deliver 100 per cent net renewables by 2027,” he said.
    


            Any sale would require the land's owner to submit a development application and decontaminate the site to the standards set by state authorities.
    


            South Australia's Environment Protection Authority said it's held preliminary talks with the council and the developer. Addressing legacy contamination is often complex, costly and time-consuming, it added.
    


            Neon and Zane organized a snap rally outside the Marion Council building on Wednesday calling for the state government to reject the re-zoning application. More than a dozen protesters held signs, including one that said, “Elon Musk can get [redacted].”
    


            They're determined to keep Tesla out of their area and are unmoved by the promise of more jobs. “They're going to be jobs on contaminated land in a company that's contaminated by Elon Musk,” said Neon.
    


            “Ninety-nine out of the 117 pages in their report were negative comments about Elon and the proposal. How can you ignore that? And if you do, you're not representing the people, you're just being bought by business.”

            A sweeping new travel ban on citizens from a dozen nations was announced by the White House on Wednesday, reviving a defining effort from the first Trump administration to crack down on entries from specific countries. 



            Trump said in a video posted Wednesday that new countries could be added to the travel ban as “threats emerge around the world.”
    


            The 12 countries targeted – plus seven more, which face partial restrictions – are mostly nations with frosty, adversarial or outwardly antagonistic relations with Washington. Many are either failed states or in the throes of repressive rule, and some are governed by groups that took control after years of US involvement in their affairs.
    


            “Frankly, we want to keep bad people out of our country,” Trump said Thursday. “The Biden administration allowed some horrendous people, and we're getting them out one by one, we're not stopping until we get them out.”
    


            For all but four of the 19 countries hit with restrictions, the administration pointed to high rates of their nationals overstaying their visas after entering the US.
    


            Visa overstays have received renewed scrutiny since the Boulder, Colorado, attack last weekend against a group campaigning in solidarity with the Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The suspect in that attack was originally from Egypt, which was not on Wednesday's travel ban list. He obtained a two-year work authorization that expired in March, a Homeland Security (DHS) official said.
    


            Seven countries were included because the administration deemed they pose a “high level of risk” to the US: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.
    


            The travel ban does not target existing visa or green card holders, and it also features carve-outs for some visa categories and for people whose entry serves US interests.
    


            Its impact will vary greatly from country to country; some nations only receive a few hundred nonimmigrant visas per year, while others have seen hundreds of thousands of people enter the US in the past decade.
    


            Travel to the US has been fully restricted for citizens from Chad, Sudan, Libya, Eritrea, the Republic of Congo, Somalia and Equatorial Guinea. Meanwhile, a partial restriction has been imposed on nationals from Burundi, Togo and Sierra Leone.
    


            The US does not issue a high number of visas to most of those countries – according to State Department data, only a few hundred or a few thousand people from each were granted immigrant and nonimmigrant visas in 2023.
    


            The White House said Somalia had been identified as a “terrorist safe haven,” led by a government that lacks “command and control of its territory.” This year, the US carried out airstrikes in Somalia against ISIS and affiliated targets, in a joint counterterrorism effort with the nation.

            Relations with Sudan have soured; last month, the Trump administration said it would impose sanctions on the military-led Sudanese government after finding that it used chemical weapons last year during its ongoing war with a rival military faction. The US has been unable to broker a ceasefire to end the conflict that has raged on for two years, leaving tens of thousands dead.
    


            The White House has also had a frosty relationship with Chad, which demanded the removal of American troops from its territory last year, as well as with Eritrea, whose military the Biden administration accused in 2023 of committing war crimes during a conflict in northern Ethiopia.
    


            Similar reprimands have been made by the US State Department against state and non-state actors in Libya, which it accused of committing crimes against humanity.
    


            Chad had one of the highest rates of visa overstays of any country included in the ban; around half of the people admitted to the US from the central African nation overstayed their visa in the 2023 financial year, according to the DHS, though the numbers of Chadians granted such visas was relatively small. The White House said Wednesday that Chad's overstay rate is “unacceptable and indicates a blatant disregard for U.S. immigration laws.”
    


            The President of Chad, Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno, said on Facebook that he had told his government to “act in accordance with the principles of reciprocity” by suspending visas to citizens of the United States.
    


            “Chad has no planes to offer, no billions of dollars to give but Chad has his dignity and pride,” he added.
    


            The African Union Commission said in a Thursday statement it was “concerned” about the impact of bans “on people-to-people ties, educational exchange, commercial engagement, and the broader diplomatic relations that have been carefully nurtured over decades.”
    


            “While recognising the sovereign right of all nations to protect their borders and ensure the security of their citizens, the African Union Commission respectfully appeals to the United States to exercise this right in a manner that is balanced, evidence-based, and reflective of the long-standing partnership between the United States and Africa,” its statement read.
    


            The ban targeted three Middle Eastern adversaries with which the US has limited or no diplomatic ties.
    


            The US does not formally recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan's official government. The militant group reclaimed power in 2021 amid a chaotic and deadly withdrawal of US forces under the Biden administration. Afghans who helped the US government during Washington's two-decade involvement in the country are exempt from the ban; they fall under a Special Immigrant Visa program that has allocated more than 50,000 visas since 2009.
    


            The Trump administration targeted Yemen's Houthi rebels with airstrikes for several weeks earlier this year, in response to the group attacking ships and disrupting trade routes in the Red Sea. The Houthis control much of western Yemen, including the capital Sanaa.
    


            Haiti has been in the grips of violent unrest for years. Gangs control at least 85% of its capital, Port-au-Prince, and have launched attacks in the country's central region in recent years. The violence has left more than one million Haitians internally displaced.
    


            Two other Latin American nations – Cuba and Venezuela – also face restrictions, though Trump stopped short of implementing a full ban. The move comes a week after the Supreme Court allowed Trump's administration to suspend a Biden-era humanitarian parole program that let half a million people from the two countries, plus Nicaragua, temporarily live and work in the US each year.
    


            Trump in March revoked temporary humanitarian parole for about 300,000 Cubans, amid a record number of arrivals of migrants from the Caribbean island. On Thursday, Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla said the ban “has racist undertones” and “damages personal, professional, academic, and cultural exchanges between the two countries.”
    


            Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yván Gil Pinto called the travel ban issued against Venezuelan nationals an “operation of hate and stigmatization,” in a statement released Thursday.
    


            Of all the countries targeted, the new restrictions may impact Venezuelans the most. More than 55,000 people from Venezuela received nonimmigrant visas to enter the US in 2023, and nearly 800,000 Venezuelans in total were granted such visas over the preceding decade, according to the State Department.
    


            The White House said both Laos and Myanmar, also known as Burma, have failed to co-operate with the US regarding the return of their nationals.

Myanmar's earthquake devastated the war-torn nation. For its reviled military leaders, it has brought opportunity



            Myanmar's ruling military junta has spent the past four years waging a brutal civil war across the Southeast Asian country, sending columns of troops on bloody rampages, torching and bombing villages, massacring residents, jailing opponents and forcing young men and women to join the army.
    


            The junta is headed by a widely reviled army chief who overthrew the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi and installed himself as leader, and the nation was thrown into further turmoil by a devastating earthquake in March.
    


            The US and Laos meanwhile have a complicated history, hampered by the US bombing of the country during its war in Vietnam. But relations have improved dramatically this century, and the US-Laos partnership is one of the most stable and productive of all 19 countries targeted by Wednesday's ban.
    


            Egypt was spared inclusion in the travel ban, even though the restrictions were expedited after an Egyptian national was charged with attempted murder after the Molotov cocktail attack in Boulder, Colorado.
    


            Egypt has long been a key US partner in the Middle East. Relations between Cairo and Washington date back to 1922, when Egypt gained independence from the United Kingdom, and have continued ever since.
    


            According to the US embassy in Egypt, some 450 Egyptians travel to the United States annually on professional and academic exchange programs.
    


            Trump told reporters Thursday that “Egypt has been a country that we deal with very closely. They have things under control. The countries that we have don't have things under control.”
    


            The Arab nation has also historically been the second biggest recipient of US military aid, following Israel. Since 1978, the US has contributed more than $50 billion in military assistance to Egypt, according to the American embassy, though some of this aid has been occasionally withheld on account of the country's human rights record.

Follow:


            The world's highest railway bridge, an ambitious piece of engineering across a mountain valley in Kashmir, was opened Friday by Indian Prime Minister Narenda Modi, just weeks after a deadly tourist massacre in the Himalayan region sparked a brief conflict with neighboring Pakistan.
    


            Modi's visit to India-administered Kashmir was his first since a brief but deadly conflict between India and Pakistan in April. The nuclear-armed neighbors traded missiles, drones, and artillery shelling for four days after New Delhi blamed the massacre on its neighbor, which Pakistan denies.
    


            Decades in the making, the arched Chenab Bridge sits 359 meters (about 1,180 feet) above the river of the same name – that's 29 meters (over 95 feet) higher than the top of the Eiffel Tower.
    


            Costing more than $160 million with a length of 1,315 meters (4,314 feet), the bridge is part of the first railway link between Kashmir and the rest of India.
    


            Modi's Hindu-nationalist government has moved to integrate the Muslim-majority region with the rest of the country, including revoking a constitutional provision that allowed it to set its own laws in 2019.
    


            The Himalayan region of Kashmir is claimed by India, Pakistan and China. All three administer a part of the region, one of the most militarized zones in the world.
    


            In addition to the Chenab Bridge, Modi also inaugurated the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link project, which connects key cities in India-administered Kashmir to the rest of India.
    


            For Modi, who swept to power more than a decade ago on a ticket of nationalism and a promise of future greatness, investments in infrastructure like the Chenab Bridge and the broader rail link project can be seen as a powerful tool for social integration and political influence. Since he was first elected in 2014, the prime minister has rapidly expanded the region's road and rail connectivity, building networks that connect disparate towns with major cities.
    


            In 2019, New Delhi revoked a constitutional provision giving India-administered Kashmir the autonomy to set its own laws. The southern and eastern portions of the region known previously as the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir became two separate union territories, bringing them under direct control of New Delhi – a move Modi claimed would promote stability, reduce corruption and boost the economy.
    


            The Chenab Bridge is being hailed as a major win for Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party government.
    


            His administration has poured billions into upgrading India's old and outdated transport network, part of its vision to transform the country into a developed nation by 2047.
    


            Among these ambitious projects is the construction of several tunnels and highways in the mountainous Himalayan region which has been criticized by some environmentalists who say the heavy construction could damage fragile topography already feeling the effects from the climate crisis.
    


            Modi's Char Dham Highway project, a multimillion-dollar infrastructure plan to improve connectivity in the state of Uttarakhand, came under fire in November 2023 when an under-construction mountain tunnel collapsed, trapping dozens of workers inside for several days with little water and oxygen.
    


            In August that year, more than a dozen workers were killed after a bridge under construction collapsed in the northeastern state of Mizoram. In June, a four-lane concrete bridge that was being built across the River Ganges in the eastern state of Bihar collapsed for the second time in just over a year, raising questions about the quality of its construction.

Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze has accused the EU of inciting and financing extremism in his country. The claim comes amid a deepening rift between Tbilisi and Brussels over alleged “democratic backsliding.”

Kobakhidze insisted on Thursday that his government has “indisputable” evidence that Western actors are backing anti-government protests in the country.

”We prove this with facts, videos, and [EU] financing practices. We have direct facts about how these people are financing extremism in our country. We talk to them with facts, but they respond with general phrases, and more often lies. This is sad,” Kobakhidze said, as cited by Rustavi 2.

Parliament Speaker Shalva Papuashvili echoed the charge, stating that “extremism in Georgia is supported and financed from the budgets of the EU.” He added that he had written to EU Ambassador Pawel Herczynski detailing the accusations but had yet to receive a reply.

The ruling Georgian Dream party, which secured a decisive parliamentary majority in October 2024, has accused Western powers of interfering in the country's domestic politics under the guise of “democracy promotion.” Officials in Tbilisi have drawn parallels to the 2014 Maidan uprising in Ukraine and say similar tactics are now being used to destabilize Georgia for refusing to adopt a confrontational stance against Russia in the Ukraine conflict.

Following Georgian Dream's victory, a coalition of pro-Western parties alleged fraud and launched protests to force the government's resignation. EU and US officials voiced support for the opposition, which Georgian leaders denounced as foreign meddling.

Brussels has also led a coordinated campaign against Georgia's foreign influence transparency law, legislation that requires political organizations to disclose substantial foreign funding. Although similar laws exist across the West, the European External Action Service claimed the legislation in Georgia was “a serious setback for democracy” and warned it could “threaten the country's EU path.”

Tensions spiked last month when French President Emmanuel Macron, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz issued a joint statement on Georgia's Independence Day, accusing the government of “democratic backsliding.” Papuashvili dismissed the statement as “shameful,” saying it disrespected both the state and its people.

Georgia was granted EU candidate status in December 2023 but has since suspended accession talks, citing Brussels' increasingly coercive tone. The government, however, insists that it remains committed to eventual EU membership.

Russian food aid to Africa is arriving at a critical moment, the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has said. 

Speaking to TASS on Thursday, Tom Fletcher emphasized that Russian assistance is particularly crucial in regions at risk of starvation, describing it as both “extremely important” and “very timely.”  

“It is a sign of the Russian government's generosity and willingness to participate in such programs,” he added. 

At the same time, Fletcher noted that growing needs across Africa mean much more remains to be done. He recounted his recent visit to Sudan, including the conflict-ravaged region of Darfur, where he met people who he said were “quite literally on the brink of starvation.” He called for enhanced cooperation among international agencies and urged greater collective generosity to meet urgent needs on the ground.

Fletcher met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday to discuss a number of issues, including “the functioning of OCHA and the United Nations' global humanitarian response system,” the Russian Foreign Ministry reported.

The same day, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin held talks with Ramtane Lamamra, the UN secretary-general's personal envoy for Sudan. According to the ministry's press service, the two officials reviewed ways to de-escalate the prolonged armed conflict in the country and emphasized the need for an urgent ceasefire.

An armed group attacked a convoy jointly operated by the World Food Program (WFP) and UNICEF near Al Fashir in North Darfur on Monday evening. At least five Sudanese contractors employed by UN agencies were killed, while several others sustained injuries. Multiple trucks were torched, and vital humanitarian supplies were damaged.

Since April 2023, Sudan has been gripped by fierce fighting between the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), with both factions vying for control amid a stalled transition to civilian rule. According to Reuters, citing the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), more than 4 million people have fled Sudan since the outbreak of the war.

US President Donald Trump has signaled that Washington could impose sanctions on both Russia and Ukraine if the conflict between the two nations does not come to an end.

Trump has thus far declined to commit to new sanctions on Russia, despite weeks of pressure from European leaders, saying only that he would act when the time felt right — and that moment had not yet come. He has also expressed concern that levying new restrictions could jeopardize peace talks between Moscow and Kiev.

During a meeting at the White House with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Thursday, Trump said he would decide when to act if it became clear that a peace deal could not be reached, noting that “it's in my brain, the deadline.”

He suggested he'd be willing to apply restrictions on both Russia and Ukraine, warning that “we'll be very, very, very tough, and it could be on both countries to be honest.”

“You know, it takes two to tango,” the US president added.

Trump likened the Ukraine conflict to “two children fighting in a park.” He also said a sanctions bill moving through the US Senate would be “guided by me,” but suggested it might be better to let Russia and Ukraine continue fighting “for a while” before “pulling them apart.”

The US president was referring to legislation backed by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a longtime Russia hawk and Trump ally, that would impose a 500% tariff on countries that buy Russian energy, uranium, and other raw materials – measures aimed chiefly at India and China.

Trump's statement comes as Kiev has ramped up attacks on Russian territory, including a UAV strike on several Russian airbases and recent acts of railway sabotage in Bryansk and Kursk regions, which claimed the lives of seven people and left scores injured.

Moscow has accused Kiev of orchestrating a series of violent incidents aimed at undermining peace talks.

Russia has also claimed that Trump is receiving “filtered” information about the Ukraine conflict from those pushing Washington toward supporting Kiev.

Moscow has repeatedly stressed that it is carrying out strikes on Ukrainian military-linked installations in response to Kiev's increased drone attacks on Russian civilian targets.

In a previously unannounced phone conversation on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin informed his US counterpart that Kiev's recent attacks were intended to derail direct talks with Moscow, the second round of which took place in Istanbul on Monday.

Revealing details of the phone call, which he described as “a good conversation,” Trump said that the Russian president “did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields.”

MOSCOW, June 6. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump administration's steps toward building the Golden Dome missile shield are turning space into an arena of armed confrontation, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said in an interview with TASS.

""Steps taken by the Trump administration to develop the US ‘Golden Dome for America' missile defense system, which provides for a significant strengthening of the arsenal of tools to conduct military operations in space, including the deployment of interception systems in orbit, is a direct path not only to the militarization of outer space, but also to its transformation into an arena of armed confrontation,"" Ryabkov said.

Russia's senior diplomat stressed that such US actions provoke escalation of tensions and an arms race in space paves the way for mutual distrust as well as for serious obstacles to cooperation on inter-state level regarding the peaceful exploration of space.

""All of this is fraught with the most serious negative consequences for international security,"" Ryabkov continued.

""In order to counter Washington's steps to deploy weapons in outer space, together with our satellite countries, we exert efforts aimed at the early start of negotiations on the development of an international legally binding tool that prevents an arms race in outer space, abbreviated as the Prevention of Arms Race in Space [PAROS], prohibiting the deployment of any type of weapon in outer space, the use of force or threats of force against space objects or with their help,"" the high-ranking diplomat noted.

On May 20, US President Donald Trump announced his country's strategy regarding how its Golden Dome missile defense shield project would move forward. The administration plans to allocate approximately $175 billion for the project. According to Trump, construction will take a little under three years.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

LONDON, June 6. /TASS/. Aggressive rhetoric against Russia coming from representatives of the British government is aimed at diverting the attention of the country's population from the accumulated social and economic problems, Russian Ambassador to London Andrey Kelin told Sky News in an interview.

Alex Chiu fell 3,000ft from a climbing route on Denali, or Mount McKinley, and was not roped up at the time

Mountaineering rangers in Alaska recovered the body of a Seattle man who died after falling 3,000ft from a climbing route on Denali, or Mount McKinley, the highest mountain in North America.

The National Park Service said that Alex Chiu, 41, was on the treacherous mountain's west buttress route when he fell from a location called Squirrel Point, about 12,000ft above sea level.

Chiu's body was transferred to the state medical examiner on Wednesday, the Denali national park and preserve said.

Two other members of Chiu's team had reported on Monday that Chui had fallen and that they had lowered themselves over the edge as far as possible but were unable to see or hear Chiu. He was not roped up at the time of the fall.

Ground and air search crews were unable to reach the site until early Wednesday because of very high winds and heavy snow. An unroped French mountaineer fell to his death near the same location in 2010. His body was never recovered.

This is the busiest time of year for climbing the peak, in May and June when climbers descend on the regional town of Talkeetna. There are currently 500 climbers on the peak and more on other mountains and glacial approaches to peaks in the spectacular range that is breathtaking but fraught with risk.

Denali is known to be deceptively dangerous, although it looks relatively benign to ordinary tourists viewing the summit on a clear day from Denali national park. Despite being lower above sea level, the mountain has a greater vertical climb from the base to the summit than the world's highest mountain, Mount Everest in the Himalayas. Climbers wanting to summit Denali must scale 18,000 vertical feet compared with Everest's 12,000ft.

Survey shows correlation between use of Chinese-owned platform and approval of unification with China

Taiwanese people who spend large amounts of time on TikTok are more likely to agree with some pro-China narratives, a survey has suggested.

The study, conducted by the Taiwan-based DoubleThink Lab, surveyed people across Taiwan in March, asking a series of questions about politics and democracy in Taiwan and China, and their views on unification of the two sides.

It found that among the respondents, agreement with criticisms of Taiwan's domestic issues, and with the prospect of unifying with China, rose as TikTok use increased, before dropping again among the heaviest users of more than 14 hours a week.

China's ruling Communist party (CCP) claims Taiwan is a province of China and has vowed to annex it under what it terms “reunification”, by force if necessary. Social media is a key battleground in China's information warfare, as it seeks to convince or coerce Taiwan into accepting annexation without military conflict.

The DoubleThink Lab report claimed the more active TikTok users showed stronger correlations with an openness to Chinese propaganda and the idea that unification with China is inevitable and democracy should be sacrificed for peace.

There was also correlation with unhappiness about current domestic issues, including opposition-driven accusations of judicial unfairness and erosions of free speech. Differences were stark among supporters of Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive party (DPP), which the CCP has labelled illegal separatists.

“Our analysis suggests that active TikTok use is more likely to influence users' political attitudes toward being more anti-democratic establishment and positive attitudes toward PRC governance, even among groups traditionally opposed to the CCP,” said the report's author, Eric Hsu.

The percentage of DPP supporters who used TikTok and thought it was acceptable to give up Taiwan's democratic system “for the sake of cross-strait peace” was 10 points higher than non-users, at 26.8%, the report said. And in response to statements that the DPP was “no different from the CCP and Taiwan lacks freedom of speech”, 23.9% of DPP supporters who used TikTok agreed, compared with 9.3% who were not active on the app.

TikTok is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, and fears of it being used to spread pro-CCP propaganda have already resulted in restrictions or threats of outright bans in several countries, including the US. In Taiwan, there are rules against TikTok being used on government devices.

In 2019, the Guardian revealed how ByteDance used TikTok to advance Beijing's foreign policy aims by moderating sensitive content. A 2023 study, by Rutgers University's Network Contagion Research Institute in the US, found TikTok's algorithms consistently amplify pro-CCP content and suppress anti-CCP narratives, with much of the pro-CCP content originating from state-linked entities.

ByteDance has long denied the allegations.

“From the CCP's founding, there has always been a strong emphasis on both the ‘pen' and the ‘gun' – meaning propaganda and force,” said Yu-hui Tai, an assistant professor at Taiwan's National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.

Tai said Taiwan was on the frontline of China's propaganda efforts, and its digital environment was “complex”. She added: “TikTok is not the only app young people use”, noting that Douyin – the Chinese domestic version of TikTok, which some Taiwanese also use – is very different in content and moderation to TikTok.

The Guardian has reported previously on the popularity of other Chinese apps that have increased their cultural influence among young Taiwanese.

Titus C Chen, a research fellow at Taiwan's National Chengchi University, said the vast majority of TikTok users “aren't actively seeking out political content when they use the platform”.

He said it could not be ruled out that users were just more inclined to agree with such views and so were being fed content that aligned with their interests.

“That said, it's undeniably true that TikTok's content – both its Chinese and international versions – is heavily influenced and controlled by the Chinese government,” said Chen. “So it's very unlikely you'll come across much content on TikTok that supports liberal democracy.”

A North Korean naval destroyer damaged in a botched launch last month is now upright and moored at a pier, North Korean state media said yesterday.

Pyongyang has said “a serious accident” happened in the May 21 attempt to launch the 5,000-tonne destroyer, with the mishap crushing sections of the bottom of the newly built ship.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un called the incident a “criminal act caused by absolute carelessness,” and the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported the arrest of four officials in connection with the botched launch.

South Korea's military said that Washington and Seoul's intelligence authorities believe North Korea's so-called “side-launch attempt” of the ship failed, and the vessel was left listing in the water.

However, KCNA yesterday said that “after restoring the balance of the destroyer early in June, the team moored it at the pier” on Thursday.

Experts would now look at its hull, it said.

KCNA reported late last month that an “underwater and internal inspection of the warship confirmed that, unlike the initial announcement, there were no holes made at the warship's bottom,” adding that the extent of the damage is “not serious.”

The South Korean military estimated that, based on its size and scale, the newly built warship is similarly equipped to the 5,000-tonne destroyer-class vessel Choe Hyon, which North Korea unveiled last month.

Pyongyang has said that the Choe Hyon is equipped with the “most powerful weapons” and would “enter into operation early next year.”

Seoul's military has said the Choe Hyon could have been developed with Russian help, possibly in exchange for Pyongyang deploying thousands of troops to help Moscow fight Ukraine.

A Japanese court overturned a US$92 billion damages verdict yesterday against the former bosses of the operator of Japan's stricken Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, thought to be the largest such award ever in the country for a civil suit. 

Four former executives had in 2022 been ordered to collectively pay ￥13.3 trillion in a suit brought by shareholders over the nuclear disaster triggered by a massive tsunami in 2011.

However, the verdict was thrown out yesterday by the Tokyo High Court, a spokeswoman for the institution said.

Shareholders had argued the catastrophe could have been prevented if Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) bosses had listened to research and implemented preventative measures like placing an emergency power source on higher ground.

However, the defendants countered that the risks were unpredictable, and the studies cited were not credible.

“The defendants ... cannot be found to have had this foreseeability at a point in time before the earthquake in question,” yesterday's court ruling said.

The ￥13.3 trillion damages award was believed to be the largest amount ever ordered in a civil suit in Japan.

It was meant to cover TEPCO's costs for dismantling reactors, compensating affected residents and cleaning up contamination.

In 2015, British oil giant BP was ordered to pay US$20.8 billion for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in what was described at the time as the highest fine ever imposed on a company in the US.

The court spokeswoman said an appeal by the shareholders for an even higher damages order of ￥22 trillion had been denied.

Hiroyuki Kawai, head of the plaintiffs legal team, issued a stark warning at a news conference yesterday.

“If I were to summarize today's ruling in one phrase: it is a ruling that will lead to future serious nuclear accidents,” he said.

TEPCO declined to comment on the High Court verdict.

Three of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant's six reactors were operating when a massive undersea earthquake triggered a massive tsunami on March 11, 2011.

They went into meltdown after their cooling systems failed when waves flooded backup generators, leading to the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.

Overall, the tsunami along Japan's northeast coast left about 18,500 people dead or missing.

In March, Japan's top court said it had finalized the acquittal of two former TEPCO executives charged with professional negligence over the Fukushima meltdown.

The decision concluded the only criminal trial to arise from the plant's 2011 accident.

The world is in great turmoil. In the war in Ukraine, which began in February 2022, the brutal fighting continues to drag on, and in the United States, the Trump administration is causing concern among its allies. So what will the international order look like going forward?

Behind all this turmoil lurks an ideological climate that is critical of liberalism. In other words, the ideals of liberalism, which spread around the globe as universal ideals following the end of the Cold War, are now facing criticism and backlash around the world. In fact, criticism, dissatisfaction, anger and hostility toward liberalism have emerged as the driving force behind politics in some major countries.

From Russian President Vladimir Putin's perspective, the spread of liberal and democratic thought and its arrival in the former Soviet republics of Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova is a national security threat to his country. This development can be seen as one side of a coin, the obverse side being an eastward expanding NATO and an expanding sphere of U.S. influence.

At the same time, the United States, which has embodied liberalism since its founding, has seen its own steady uptick in critiques of such thinking.

For instance, in his 2018 book “Why Liberalism Failed,” Prof. Patrick Deneen of the University of Notre Dame, whose philosophy is close to that of the Trump administration and is close to U.S. Vice President JD Vance, argued that liberalism “has failed because it has succeeded.”

Deneen predicted that in response to the anger and fear felt by the public following the collapse of liberalism, a populist nationalist dictatorship or a military dictatorship would be highly likely.

After the end of the Cold War, paeans were made to the triumph of democracy and liberal economics over the communist system.

As can be seen in Francis Fukuyama's “The End of History?” essay, published in 1989, there was a growing utopian belief that foresaw the inevitable spread of liberalism around the world.

However, history has not come to an end so easily.

John Gray, a former professor at the London School of Economics, was one of the first scholars who warned against such optimistic thinking and criticized it, and he published many papers on the history of liberal thought.

In his book “False Dawn: The Delusions of Global Capitalism” — published in 1998, or 20 years before Deneen's own book critical of liberalism — Gray argued there was a rather strong possibility that the United States' laissez-faire economics would implode as emerging economic powers challenged its hegemonic place in the world economy.

For 30 years after the end of the Cold War, we blindly believed in the utopian idea that liberal economics and democracy would expand across the world, and we have looked optimistically toward the future world order.

But now we are faced with Russia's relentless aggression and violence against Ukraine. On top of that, we have witnessed the Trump administration pull back on international cooperation and challenge global norms time and time again.

“The Counter-Enlightenment” is an essay written by British political theorist Isaiah Berlin, who was one of the most renowned thinkers in the second half of the 20th century and lectured at the University of Oxford for many years. It provides a useful guide to the dynamics of world politics.

In his essay, Berlin focuses on the spread of a backlash rooted in the culture, history and traditions of each region in response to the Enlightenment's rationalism and faith in science, which spread throughout Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries.

He warned that “Cosmopolitanism is the shedding of all that makes one most human, most oneself.” This way of thinking prompted many to believe that the uniqueness and culture of each nation and region should be preserved.

For instance, German philosopher Johann Gottfried von Herder, who lived in the 18th and 19th centuries, opposed the spread of Enlightenment ideals and acknowledged that “There is a plurality of incommensurable cultures.” He maintained that “To belong to a given community, to be connected with its members by indissoluble and impalpable ties of common language, historical memory, habit, tradition and feeling, is a basic human need.”

Berlin also focused on French conservative thinkers such as the Catholic Joseph de Maistre. De Maistre “held the Enlightenment to be one of the most foolish, as well as the most ruinous, forms of social thinking,” Berlin wrote, adding that, “The conception of man as naturally disposed to benevolence, cooperation and peace, or, at any rate, capable of being shaped in this direction by appropriate education or legislation, is for [de Maistre] shallow and false.” De Maistre, according to Berlin, believed nature to be “a field of unceasing slaughter” and that “Men are by nature aggressive and destructive; they rebel over trifles.”

Berlin saw the anti-Enlightenment movement in the 19th century as a reaction to the Enlightenment, and in the same way, we are now witnessing a reaction against the universalist, rationalistic liberalism of the post-Cold War period.

Taking a bird's-eye view of the history of the past 150 years, a tendency appears that when you have the spread of utopianism based on the ideas of Enlightenment liberalism, there is a subsequent outburst of anti-Enlightenment thought or nationalism in reaction.

Russia, the United States and China are all seeing criticism of liberalism and a rise of nationalism, and the same can be said for many European countries where far-right forces are on the rise.

The anti-Enlightenment movement that began in the 19th century, the Romantic movement that defended each culture and tradition, and the rise of nationalism all culminated in World War I. Then, in the 1930s, the rise of fascism and Nazism as a critique of liberalism led to World War II. In our post-Cold War era, Russia is continuing a major war against Ukraine, but we are not yet in another world war.

What we can do now is reconcile these two modes of thinking — the liberal international order that is based on free trade and democracy, the very foundations of the post-World War II international order, and the anti-Enlightenment thought critical of liberalism that is flaring up in the world's major countries.

In his 1939 book “The Twenty Years' Crisis, 1919-1939,” British historian E.H. Carr, who sought peace in the late 1930s, explored ways to optimally merge utopianism and realism.

After the “30 years' crisis,” in which post-Cold War utopianism collapsed, the world remains plagued by crises, uncertainty and conflict. We must find a new balance.

Tohoku University will hire about 500 world-class researchers by fiscal 2029, it was learned on Thursday.

Tohoku University is the only university recognized by the Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Ministry as a University for International Research Excellence, or a university that aims to achieve the world's highest level of research abilities. The university will use ¥30 billion in government subsidies to hire the researchers.

Over the next 25 years, the university hopes to increase its ratio of foreign researchers from 12% to 30%. This fiscal year, it plans to use ¥2.2 billion of the ¥15.4 billion in grants it has received as a university of excellence to hire about 100 people. Currently, it is negotiating with 11 overseas researchers whose annual salaries exceed ¥20 million.

The Trump administration's cuts to science and technology budgets have presented a chance to snag researchers who are struggling to continue their research in the United States. And while there is a large gap in salaries between Japan and the United States, the university will pay according to performance and will not set salary caps.

“We hope to attract excellent researchers from all over the world to enhance our research capabilities,” said a university source.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. 

An oil refinery in the city of Engels in Russia's Saratov Oblast was engulfed in flames after an overnight Ukrainian drone attack on June 6, Russian officials and media outlets reported. 

Ukraine has previously targeted the Kristal Plant, an oil refinery in Engels that supplies fuel to Russia's Engels-2 military airfield. The airfield is one of the country's key strategic military bases. It hosts long-range bombers, including the nuclear-capable Tu-95 and Tu-160 aircraft. 

Residents shared footage of major fires breaking out in Engels following a drone attack, according to the independent Russian Telegram news channel Astra. Locals reported that the refinery was under attack and that a residential building had been hit. 

The Saratov airport imposed restrictions due to the drone threat, according to Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya). 

Saratov Oblast Governor Roman Busargin claimed that a fire had broken out at an unspecified ""industrial enterprise"" and that emergency responders had been dispatched to the scene. He also said drones caused damage to a residential building. No casualties were reported.

The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that 174 Ukrainian drones were intercepted overnight, targeting 12 regions within Russia as well as Russian-occupied Crimea.

The Kyiv Independent could not confirm these claims. 

The reported drone attack comes after a series of major Ukrainian strikes against military targets inside Russia. 

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on June 1 launched Operation Spiderweb, a daring mass drone attack that damaged 41 Russian heavy bombers at four key airfields throughout the country. The operation reportedly targeted A-50, Tu-95, and Tu-22 M3 planes parked at the Belaya, Diaghilev, Olenya, and Ivanovo air bases, causing approximately $7 billion in damage. 

In the following days, Ukraine carried out strikes against Russia's Crimean Bridge, a military base in distant Vladivostok,  and a missile base in Bryansk Oblast.

Located in Russia's Saratov Oblast, around 600 kilometers (370 miles) from the front lines in Ukraine, the Engels-2 base has been a frequent target of Ukrainian strikes since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. The airfield houses three types of strategic bombers regularly used in missile attacks on Ukraine: the Tu-95, Tu-22, and Tu-160.

An attack against the air base on March 20 destroyed 96 air-launched cruise missiles, according to Ukraine's General Staff.

Russia is prepared to offer political asylum to tech billionaire Elon Musk following his public feud with U.S. President Donald Trump, Dmitry Novikov, deputy chair of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, said June 6.

""I think Musk is playing a completely different game, that he won't need political asylum, although if he did, Russia could certainly provide it,"" Novikov told the state-run news agency TASS.

The remarks came days after Musk's 130-day stint as head of a temporary federal commission ended on May 30, and amid deepening tensions between the Tesla CEO and Trump. 

The feud began when Musk publicly criticized the administration's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" a sweeping tax proposal that economists warn could expand the U.S. deficit by $600 billion.

Trump responded by personally attacking Musk during his meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on June 5. In his Truth Social post, Trump said that Musk ""just went crazy.""

Musk replied on social media that Trump owed his electoral victory to him, claiming that without his influence, Democrats would have maintained control of the House.

Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council and a frequent purveyor of anti-Western rhetoric, joked on X that Moscow would broker peace between ""D and E"" — referring to Trump and Musk — in exchange for Starlink shares. 

""Don't fight, guys,"" Medvedev wrote.

Musk was a key figure in Trump's campaign and early administration. As head of the government efficiency task force, he led efforts to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which has provided over $37 billion in aid to Ukraine.

Despite initially supporting Ukraine and providing Starlink satellite systems to bolster military communications, Musk has increasingly echoed Russian narratives. 

The billionaire has falsely claimed that President Volodymyr Zelensky has little support in Ukraine and accused Kyiv of waging a ""never-ending draft meat grinder.""

He has also lobbied against U.S. military assistance to Ukraine, arguing it only prolongs the war — a line frequently used by Kremlin officials to discourage Western backing for Kyiv.

Musk's comments have earned praise from Russian officials and propagandists, including state TV hosts and military bloggers who now view the billionaire as a sympathetic figure.

A new Leger poll released on Thursday shows Canadian travel to the U.S., including cities such as New York, is down considerably.Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters

For years, the plan was New York. A long weekend, an old friend, her milestone birthday. But in this tumultuous spring of 2025, New York was not an option. 

We swapped out Broadway for an Ontario road trip to Prince Edward County; the only Big Apple these Canadians were going to get anywhere near was Colborne's roadside attraction along the 401.

A version of this is being repeated across the country in this annus horribilis for Canadian-U.S. relations, with more tales of travel switch-outs emerging as the summer season begins. Our elbows might be getting a bit sore by now, but our patriotism game is strong.

Canadians did not have a say in the U.S. election that has played havoc with the economy and brought threats to our sovereignty. Nor do we have a voice in the undemocratic horror show we are witnessing: immigration roundups, sweeping travel bans. 

But we can vote with our travel itineraries. And we are.

Canadians go elbows up on U.S. travel, opting for these destinations instead

A new Leger poll released on Thursday shows Canadian travel to the U.S. “collapsing” with 71 per cent less likely to travel to the U.S. in 2025 compared to last year. And 75 per cent of Canadians who were planning a trip to the U.S. say the tariff announcements have influenced their travel plans. Meanwhile, the Conference Board of Canada found 27 per cent of Canadian respondents are considering a trip to the U.S. in the next few years, down from more than 50 per cent in the same survey last year. 

Travel to the U.S. was down in April, with a drop of more than 35 per cent in Canadian residents returning over land borders from the year before. By air, the drop was nearly 20 per cent. 

This could mean as much as $8.8-billion in extra business for Canadian domestic tourism, according to the Conference Board of Canada. 

But this travel war has casualties, such as businesses that rely on travel to the U.S. As someone who hears often from publicists (occupational hazard), I started to feel for people whose jobs it is to sell U.S. destinations to Canadians. Imagine having to do that right now. 

They're trying to lure us back. For example, the Canadian firm representing Visit Detroit pitched a Mother's Day “stylish weekend” trip. Tone deaf or desperate? Or maybe – on brand – naively hopeful? Because the chances of Canada's national newspaper – which has taken on the grassroots Elbows Up campaign in a big way – suggesting you take mom over the border to celebrate her special day were approximately nil. 

Travellers change plans to avoid intense U.S. border checks as Canadian airlines rethink routes

Publicists tell me, though, that while they are not getting much (or any) uptake on these pitches, their objectives include keeping their destinations on Canadian travellers' radars. 

This crisis has been a recurring theme this week in Saskatoon, at the Travel Media Association of Canada Conference, event chair Tania Kedikian tells me. 

Ms. Kedikian is senior account director at Development Counsellors International (“The Leader in Marketing Places”) and she oversees DCI's marketing strategy for all U.S. clients that are interested in the Canadian market. (Say a prayer for her.)

“Some journalists have told us candidly: they're hesitant to promote U.S. travel right now,” she told me.

But, with her rose-coloured sunnies firmly on, she says she believes this is not a flat-out rejection of the U.S. For instance, she sees event-driven travel emerging strongly; trips to the U.S. tied to a specific event – the Boston Marathon, a Beyonce concert. “In those cases, opportunity is trumping all,” she wrote to me, employing an, er, interesting choice of words. 

Opinion: If Canadians have to ride the tariff rollercoaster, we can at least boycott U.S. travel

Sorry, but this Canadian is not buying it. I can't be the only one who has cancelled event-driven travel (the FIFA Club World Cup this summer – sob). And when FIFA's main event, the World Cup, comes to North America next year, how will all of this affect games played in the U.S.?

There are more severe victims of the Donald Trump administration than Canadian publicists and PR firms, obviously. But you've got to feel for them.

An even greater concern is for Canadian destinations that may experience a drop in U.S. tourism. A video released this week featuring local leaders in Northern Ontario's Lake Superior region suggests a slight air of desperation. “I'd like to send out a big smalltown welcome to our American friends,” says Kevin Mullins, mayor of the township of Schreiber. “I'd like you to know we're open for business.”

Prince Edward County was lovely, if a little pricey. My friend and I got our celebratory weekend and we didn't have to deal with a hostile exchange rate or shakedown at the border.

But here was the best part: I allowed myself, no prescribed myself, a break from anything involving He Who Is Ruining Everything. It was a most excellent getaway.

A planned port in Nanisivik announced in 2007 has been downgraded to a refuelling station that will operate just one month a year.Steven Chase/The Globe and Mail

All too often, Canada has been happy to assert Arctic sovereignty on the cheap. But the bill for our historical stinginess has come due, and Ottawa should pay it as smartly and as quickly as possible.

Even before Canada existed, much of the North was effectively governed by the Hudson's Bay Company. When the fur trade shrank, trading companies, not Ottawa, were expected to provide relief for the Inuit, even after Confederation. 

Decades later, in the 1950s, Ottawa leaned on the United States to build community infrastructure and the military systems that would become the North American Aerospace Defense Command. (Even today, the federal Arctic policy released in December contains more references to a “North American Arctic” than a strictly Canadian one.)

Opinion: Canada has long branded itself as an Arctic power. It's time to start acting like one

At around the same time, Ottawa relocated 92 Inuit to the harsh High Arctic as “human flagpoles,” whose presence would project Canadian sovereignty. Ottawa rightly apologized in 2010, in part because of a slew of broken promises.

Huge delays and cost overruns are inherent when building infrastructure or ships – understandable, given the northern climate's uniquely complex challenges. A planned port in Nanisivik announced in 2007 has become emblematic of those challenges. After significant budget cuts, the project has been downgraded to a refuelling station that will operate just one month a year. There is no planned opening date. 

However, amid belligerence from an increasingly unreliable Washington and escalation by allegedly “near-Arctic” China and an emboldened Russia, securing the Arctic became a serious issue in the federal campaign. It is a positive signal that Ottawa appears to care about nearly 40 per cent of the country's land mass again; Fort Smith, NWT-born Prime Minister Mark Carney has promised to pour billions into a radar system and military expansions. 

But those projects will take a long time. To truly stake its position in an increasingly contested region, Canada needs to work in concert with Indigenous peoples and do hard things quickly – and more responsibly than during the Cold War. 

There are avenues by which Canada can strengthen its Arctic claims and the people that live there in the near-term. The 1st Canadian Ranger Patrol Group – army reservists billed as Canada's eyes in the north – are a success story on both counts. The approximately 2,000-strong, primarily Indigenous group employs locals part-time to lead Arctic training for the Canadian military, support research projects, and respond to emergencies, among other responsibilities.

But the Rangers cannot be asked to bear the burden of maintaining Canadian sovereignty too, especially because they are often underequipped by distant decision-makers. To take just one recent example, some Rangers' rifles were found to crack in the Arctic environment – this, after it took until 2019 to develop replacements for the surplus Second World War-era guns they'd used for 75 years.

Increasing the rotations of CAF members serving in the North, particularly around the Northwest Passage, would drive associated Ranger activity, create a more reliable CAF presence, and bolster the military's Arctic readiness. A recently announced plan to deploy forces for up to 10 months a year is a good start, but that effort needs to be sustained. 

Meanwhile, federal departments have earned a reputation among Arctic communities for being more concerned with jurisdictional minutiae. The Carney government's creation of a ministry for Northern and Arctic Affairs could end that siloed mentality, but the peril is that it becomes one more piece of red tape. Local groups have long called for a centralized decision-making agency based in the North, a move that would send the message that Ottawa sees the Arctic as more than an outpost.

Finally, Ottawa should ensure that investment is funnelled toward projects with both military and civilian benefits. Whether it's subsea fibre-optic cables to create surveillance capabilities while providing northern communities reliable high-speed internet, or building roads and power stations, dual-use developments help offset the tougher business case for building in the complicated Arctic.

Arctic sovereignty is enjoying a moment. But history shows that it could fall off Ottawa's agenda once again if the sense of threat diminishes. Canadians must demand more and exploit this too-rare window of interest in the Arctic, because being outpaced in Canada's own front yard by other countries is more than embarrassing – it's dangerous.

The US president said he spoke with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and accepted an invitation to China. He added US and Chinese trade negotiating teams will be meeting soon. 

US President Donald Trump said he had a ""very good phone call"" with China's President Xi Jinping on Thursday.

In comments posted on his Truth Social platform, Trump said ""some of the intricacies of our recently made, and agreed to, Trade Deal"" had been discussed.

The US president said the call lasted around one and a half hours and ""resulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries.""

Trump said Xi ""graciously invited"" him and the first lady to visit China, to which he ""reciprocated.""

""As Presidents of two Great Nations, this is something that we both look forward to doing,"" Trump said.

Trump also made reference to the call during a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office and confirmed that he would be making a visit to China.

""He invited me to China and I invited him here, we both accepted. So, I will be going there with the first lady at a certain point and he will be coming here, hopefully with the first lady of China, "" Trump said.

US and Chinese teams would be meeting ""shortly"" at a yet to be determined location the US leader said and would involve Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and US Trade Representative, ambassador Jamieson Greer.

Trump emphasized that talks had focused almost entirely on trade with no discussions relating to Russia, Ukraine or Iran.

The call comes amid a 90-day tariff truce that came into effect last month which paused a spiraling trade war between the world's two largest economies.

Trump has lowered his 145% tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% for 90 days to allow for talks while China also reduced its taxes on US goods from 125% to 10%.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has criticized Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip, but reiterated that Germany will continue to deliver weapons to Israel during a visit to Berlin by counterpart Gideon Saar. 

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar met with his German counterpart, Johann Wadephul, in Berlin on Thursday.

The meeting took place a day after Wadephul promised that Germany would send more arms to Israel despite growing international calls for a weapons embargo.

Speaking at a press conference with his counterpart, Saar, Wadephul criticized Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip.

The German minister said he had renewed his ""urgent request to allow humanitarian aid to Gaza"" without restrictions as required by international law.

Wadephul also decried the Israeli government's announcement that it would allow 22 more settlements in the West Bank. He said that the German government ""rejects"" the creation of new Israeli settlements there as illegal under international law.

Meanwhile, Saar appealed to Germany to give a chance to an alternative foundation to distribute humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip.

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) is controversial because it is supported by Israel and the United States. It circumvents United Nations aid agencies and other initiatives, and it has been accused of endangering civilians in the process.

""This effort has the potential to free the Palestinian population from Hamas's stranglehold and end this war,"" Saar said, adding that this type of distribution could prevent Hamas from appropriating the aid.

Hamas is recognized as a terrorist organization by the German government, the EU, the US and some Arab states.

However, Wadephul stressed that Israel has a right to defend itself against Hamas and other enemies, and that ""therefore Germany will of course continue to support Israel with arms deliveries, that was never in doubt.""

Wadephul also said that recognizing a Palestinian state now would send ""the wrong signal,"" adding that negotiations between Israel and Palestine must conclude before a Palestinian state is recognized.

He added that the European Union should maintain its pact governing political and economic ties with Israel, which was placed under review last month due to the situation in Gaza.

Thursday's meeting was the second official meeting between the two ministers. The first took place on May 11 in Israel.

During Saar's visit to Berlin, dozens of demonstrators protested Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip. The protests began in front of the German Foreign Ministry in the morning under the slogan ""Red Line of International Law.""

Participants waved Palestinian flags and carried banners with slogans such as ""No support for war crimes in Gaza,"" ""Stop the arms deliveries,"" and ""Stop the deliberate starvation of the people of Gaza.""

Earlier in the day, the two top diplomats laid a wreath at Berlin's Holocaust Memorial, which commemorates the 6 million Jews killed in Europe under Germany's Nazi regime from 1933 to 1945.

""The fight against antisemitism, standing up for Jewish life in Germany and the commitment to the security and peaceful future of the state of Israel is and will remain our obligation, Wadephul said as he laid a wreath at the memorial in central Berlin with Saar. 

The memorial ""reminds us Germans to remember the victims, to honour the survivors and to learn the lessons from the crimes against humanity of the Shoah,"" he added.

For his part, Saar said that 80 years after the end of the Holocaust, ""the lessons seem to have been forgotten."" 

""In Germany, there's an antisemitic incident once every hour,"" the Israeli minister said, referring to a report published by a monitor on Wednesday. 

Wadephul said he was ""deeply ashamed"" that anti-Semitic offenses in Germany have reached a new high.

Wadephul's promise of more arms deliveries to Israel on Wednesday came as an apparent reversal of comments made to the German daily Süddeutsche Zeitung last week.

There, he suggested that further arms shipments to Israel were dependent on a government review of whether Israeli actions in Gaza complied with international humanitarian law.

Israel launched its offensive in the Gaza Strip in response to raids led by the Palestinian militant group Hamas in southern Israel on October 7, 2023, in which some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and some 250 hostages were taken.

The country is now coming under increasing international pressure to stop its military operation in view of the desolate humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territory. Gazan health authorities estimate 54,000 people have been killed,

Tesla CEO Elon Musk spent some $300 million on Donald Trump's campaign, gaining unprecedented access to the Republican president's administration. What does their public row mean for Musk's empire?

Once a vocal critic of Donald Trump during his 2016 United States election campaign, Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, pivoted from his Democratic Party roots to embrace Trump's policies during the Republican's second term.

Frustrated by Obama-era regulations stifling his ventures, Musk embraced Trump's agenda of tax cuts and deregulation.

Their bond grew from mutual respect to a robust political alliance, which saw Musk last year back Trump's reelection campaign to the tune of nearly $300 billion (€263 billion).

When Trump returned to the White House in January, the world's richest man took on an advisory role in the administration, leading the controversial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Tasked with slashing public spending, Musk's role stirred controversy, impacting Tesla's stock price and auto sales. After months of pressure from investors, Musk agreed last month to scale back his work in Trump's government.

On Thursday, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the ""The Dogefather,"" Musk was given an initially cordial farewell by the president in the Oval Office.

But Trump could not contain his frustration at Musk's earlier criticism of his administration's sweeping tax and spending bill, which the Tesla founder called fiscally reckless and a ""disgusting abomination.""

After Musk then accused the US president of alleged ties to child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the news conference ended with Trump threatening to revoke Musk's government contracts, which could cost his business empire billions of dollars.

Over the next few hours, the row spilled over to social media, where both men repeated their White House remarks, prompting the SpaceX owner to announce an immediate decommissioning of its Dragon spacecraft, before appearing to back down.

Tesla stock lost about $150 billion in market value on Thursday — the largest single-day decline in its history. The stock closed down over 14%.

However, news outlet Politico reported Friday that the two men were scheduled to speak later in the day in the hope of defusing the situation, which caused a sharp reversal in the stock's fortunes. Tesla stock was up 5% in pre-market trade.

However, a White House official said later Friday that Trump had no plans for any call, adding that he may get rid of his Tesla bought in March in a show of support against Musk in the face of anti-Tesla protests.

Tesla shares have been on a wild rollercoaster ride this year after a strong performance around the US election. Having peaked at $428 in January, shares in the electric vehiclemaker plummeted by almost half in March as investors reacted negatively to Musk's involvement in the Trump administration.

Tesla stock then rallied when Trump paused his unprecedented tariffs on the rest of the world and after US regulators eased rules on self-driving vehicles.



The public spat, as well as Trump's budget plans, have left the fortunes of Musk's companies hanging in the balance.

Tesla, Musk's most profitable firm, could be severely impacted by Trump's plans to cut a subsidy on new electric vehicles that is worth up to $7,500 for buyers.

Despite Musk's aggressive criticism and lobbying by Tesla, Trump plans to eliminate the credit by the end of the year, seven years before it was due to expire.

News agency Bloomberg cited JP Morgan analysts as saying that the cut would reduce Tesla's full-year profit by $1.2 billion. Cuts to state-level credits could further impact the EV maker's bottom line this financial year.

It could, however, encourage EV buyers to bring forward their plans and spur demand for Tesla's vehicles in the short term.

Tesla is already being impacted by Trump's tariffs as the firm relies on Chinese parts for its Cybercab robotaxi and Semi electric truck.

However, it is unclear whether Trump can unilaterally make good on his threat to tear up federal contracts with Musk's firms like SpaceX.

Since 2000, SpaceX has received more than $22 billion in contracts from the US Defense Department and space agency NASA.

If Trump were to terminate the contracts, it would have a huge financial impact on SpaceX and disrupt the US government's space ambitions.

SpaceX's Crew Dragon is currently the only US spacecraft certified to carry crew to the International Space Station (ISS).

Any ending of Pentagon contracts involving Musk's Starlink satellite internet service would also be a lose-lose for both Musk and the government.

Starlink provides broadband services to rural areas. Terminals are also deployed on US military bases, ships, aircraft, and armored vehicles. The satellite internet service is often used for disaster response.

Donald Trump is planning to sell the White House Tesla amid a bitter row with Elon Musk.

Mr Trump purchased a red Model S Tesla in March when Mr Musk brought a range of his fleet to the White House for the president to peruse.

The purchase was a show of support for Mr Musk's business at a time when his shares were tumbling, with Mr Trump declaring the car a “great product” and “as good as it gets”.

However, a senior administration official told NewsNation that Mr Trump now plans to sell or give away the car, which is currently parked at the White House and used by staff.

Mr Musk spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the president's re-election campaign before assuming a senior role in his government but the two men have bitterly fallen-out, primarily because of disagreements over Mr Trump's tax-and-spend bill.

On Thursday, Mr Trump suggested the Tesla billionaire had developed “Trump derangement syndrome” while Mr Musk suggested he should be impeached and will cause the US to go into recession.

The president continued the war of words on Friday when he claimed Mr Musk had “lost his mind”, despite officials claiming he was “over” their public spat.

Thanks for following our live coverage. This blog is now closed.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, the firebrand Republican congresswoman, has hit out at Elon Musk for “lashing out on the internet”.

The intervention is significant from the Georgia representative, who as chair of the House of Representatives' Doge subcommittee would in theory be one of Mr Musk's closest allies in Congress.

Referring to Mr Musk spending close to $300 million on Mr Trump's re-election campaign, she said: “Every single one of those votes, no matter how much money they have, matter... whether it was $1 or 100 donated, or hundreds of millions of dollars donated, I think they're all the same.

“And I think each voice really matters. 

“And I don't think lashing out on the internet is the way to handle any kind of disagreement, especially when you have each other's cell phones.”

Donald Trump has said Elon Musk has “lost his mind” in an escalation of his public war of words with the tech billionaire.

Asked about reports of a scheduled call with Mr Musk later today, Mr Trump told ABC News: “You mean the man who has lost his mind?”

The US president added that he was “not particularly” interested in speaking with Mr Musk, with whom he has clashed over his tax and spend bill.

The comments came after White House sources told The Telegraph that Mr Trump was “over it” and wanted to move on from the public spat, which ended with Mr Musk calling for the president's impeachment.

A Trump official said: “I don't think the president is interested in speaking to Elon right now. But he's also over it and wants to stay focused on passing the bill.

“That was his mindset when he left last night, and that's his mindset moving forward.”

Other than Mr Trump's comments earlier today - calling Mr Musk “crazy” - there is no sign of the feud continuing on social media...at least for now. 

The US president's last post on his Truth Social was about the economy. 

“GREAT JOB NUMBERS, STOCK MARKET UP BIG! AT THE SAME TIME, BILLIONS POURING IN FROM TARIFFS!!!” he posted. 

Mr Musk, meanwhile, congratulated Tesla's Berlin team after it produced its eight millionth vehicle in the German capital. 

Congratulations Tesla Giga Berlin team!! https://t.co/IpekyFE39y

If you're just catching up on the latest between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, here's where things stand...

Americans should continue to put their trust in Donald Trump, who “continues to beat expectations”, the White House has said.

Karoline Leavitt, Mr Trump's press secretary, posted figures on X showing that the US economy added 139,000 jobs in May, which was more than expected.

“President Trump's American First Economic Agenda has created a BOOMING economy - jobs are up, unemployment is down, wages are increasing, and inflation is dead.

“More than 139,000 good jobs were added to the private sector in May, all accounted for by American-born workers. Americans should continue to Trust in President Trump, who continues to beat expectations.”

The row between the President and Elon Musk could also hit the tech billionaire's Starlink internet service.

An offshoot of Mr Musk's SpaceX company,  Starlink, uses satellites to deliver broadband services to areas which would otherwise be off-grid.

The contracts with the Federal government are worth millions of dollars to Mr Musk.

They include a $70 million deal to provide satellite communications to 54  stations used by the  Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard.

Starlink is also used by the Federal Communications Commission to provide rural broadband to 642,000 homes.The company is currently negotiating new contracts with the US Geological Survey, the Army, and the Navy.

Not long ago, Elon Musk was a darling of American progressives.

A visionary bringing electric cars to the people, and voting Democrat for more than two decades.

He then became their self-appointed nemesis, clearing the US government of a “viper's nest of radical-Left Marxists who hate America”.

So, how did Musk make the political voyage from Left to Right in record time?

Mike Johnson, speaker of the US House of Representatives, expressed confusion over Elon Musk's criticism of the GOP tax and spending bill and Donald Trump.

Mr Johnson has reportedly been contacting Mr Musk through calls and messages to persuade him to reconsider his stance.

Speaking to reporters, Mr Johnson said he wasn't sure “what has motivated this disturbance to begin, but obviously it's not helpful”.

He added that he would prefer “that policy disputes are not personal”.

“I've tried very hard to speak with Elon over and over, you know, and talk with him about what I believe are misconceptions he has about this bill and what it is,” Mr Johnson said.

An online poll has shown that Americans are largely siding with President Trump over Elon Musk, although the vast majority preferred to stay out of the dispute.

When asked by YouGov who they supported - Mr Trump, Mr Musk, or neither - 28 per cent chose Mr Trump, 8 per cent backed Mr Musk, and 52 per cent sided with neither.

Amongst Republicans, support for Mr Trump was overwhelming at 71 per cent, compared to just 6 per cent for Mr Musk, with 12 per cent choosing neither. 

Democrats mostly favoured neither, but amongst those who picked a side, 11 per cent supported Mr Musk versus 4 per cent for Mr Trump.

Senior Russian officials have made digs at both Donald Trump and Elon Musk, joking about hosting peace talks, while another said Mr Musk should bring his businesses to Russia.

“Elon, don't be upset!” nationalist senator Dmitry Rogozin, who once ran Russia's space programme, wrote on Mr Musk's X social media site. 

“If you encounter insurmountable problems in the US, come to us. Here you will find reliable comrades and complete freedom of technical creativity.”

Dmitry Medvedev, a senior security official and former Russian president, posted: “We are ready to facilitate the conclusion of a peace deal between D and E for a reasonable fee and to accept Starlink shares as payment. Don't fight, guys!”

Margarita Simonyan, one of Russia's most powerful state media executives, mocked it as an example of “modern US political culture”. 

“Sort of like the English Industrial Revolution. Only in reverse,” she added. 

Donald Trump has said that Elon Musk has “a problem” in his latest comments on the feud between them.

“I'm not even thinking about Elon... He's got a problem,” he reportedly told ABC News. “The poor guy's got a problem.”

Mr Trump added: “I won't be speaking to him for a while, I guess, but I wish him well.”

Vice President JD Vance said Donald Trump's dismissal of his former ally Elon Musk from the MAGA circle was neither rash nor ill-planned.

“There are many lies the corporate media tells about President Trump. One of the most glaring is that he's impulsive or short-tempered,” Mr Vance wrote on X

“Anyone who has seen him operate under pressure knows that's ridiculous,” he said. “It's (maybe) the single biggest disconnect between fake media perception and reality.”

Late on Thursday, Mr Vance made his loyalty to Mr Trump clear, saying he was “proud to stand beside him”.

Donald Trump is reportedly considering selling or giving away the red Tesla car he purchased earlier this year, according to a senior White House official.

Mr Trump bought the car during a White House photo-op intended to promote Elon Musk's business.

As of Thursday evening, the vehicle remained parked outside the West Wing.

A planned meeting between US and Chinese officials on trade is expected to take place within seven days, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Friday, a day after President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping spoke.

Readers of The Telegraph have had their say on the public spat between Elon Musk and Donald Trump. You can add your own thoughts at the bottom of this page. 

Yesterday evening, there were signs that Elon Musk and Donald Trump could reconcile after their argument played out across social media.  

Mr Trump projected an air of nonchalance as he spoke about the spat in a phone call last night. “Oh it's okay,” Mr Trump told Politico when asked about the argument. “It's going very well, never done better.”

Mr Musk also appeared agreeable to a truce last night when hedge fund manager Bill Ackman moved to ease tension.“I support @realDonaldTrump and @elonmusk and they should make peace for the benefit of our great country,” Mr Ackman wrote on X.“You're not wrong,” Mr Musk responded. 

Those hopes were dashed when White House sources denied any possibility of a phone call between the pair today. 

The Trump-Musk alliance was always on shaky ground - and now, with a spectacular bang, it has crashed.

But from Mr Trump's relentless need to dominate the spotlight to his history of turning on allies, many say this explosive split was almost inevitable.

Here, The Telegraph's Michael Lind breaks down why their public fallout came as no surprise.

 A bust in honour of Elon Musk was vandalised in Brownsville, Texas, as the feud escalates. 

Quotes from sources close to the White House reveal a tense and uneasy view of the fallout between Donald Trump and Elon Musk.

One insider described Mr Trump as concerned about Mr Musk's mental state, telling POLITICO: “The president is worried Elon is not well… and is just kind of freaking out.”

But even taking this into consideration, the source said Mr Trump's combative nature remains: “He'll punch at whoever punches him if he thinks he needs it.”

Another senior official hinted that the administration is unsurprised that their relationship has suddenly soured.

“Everyone knew this was gonna end badly. We're dealing with someone who is unstable… we saw it coming,” they said.

While the comments offer insight into the workings of their relationship, perhaps more importantly, they could present Mr Musk with an opportunity to back-pedal by attributing his actions to going through a “difficult time”.

The breakdown of Donald Trump's relationship with Elon Musk yesterday resulted in a combined loss of about $21 billion for both men.

Both Mr Trump and Mr Musk oversee vast business empires, and each had a key public company affected by the fallout. 

As their social media feud escalated into personal attacks, investors reacted sharply.

Tesla shares plunged 14.3 per cent, wiping nearly $20 billion off Mr Musk's net worth.

Meanwhile, Trump Media & Technology Group's stock fell 8 per cent, costing Mr Trump around $202 million.

The most significant blow to Mr Trump came from the roughly 10 per cent drop in his Official Trump meme coin, which could have cost him nearly $900 million.

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, has called Elon Musk's behaviour “an unfortunate episode”, adding the Tesla boss is “unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted”.

In a post on X, Ms Leavitt wrote that Donald Trump's “number one focus” is ensuring that the legislation passes smoothly. 

“This is a transformative piece of legislation that delivers on the Make America Great Agenda by delivering the largest tax cuts and border security investments in HISTORY,” she added. 

President Trump's number one focus remains on passing the One Big, Beautiful Bill.This is a transformative piece of legislation that delivers on the Make America Great Agenda by delivering the largest tax cuts and border security investments in HISTORY.  Get it passed! pic.twitter.com/qhad4N0BIR

Sweeping cuts introduced by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) will have a lasting impact on foreign aid, global health, and development programmes.

The end of dozens of USAID projects has limited the resources it will spend on disaster relief, food security, and refugee support, worsening crises in vulnerable regions.

Cuts to funding for initiatives like the Global Fund or pandemic preparedness set back efforts to combat infectious diseases, including malaria, tuberculosis, and Covid-19.

The US is also said to be proposing cuts to its flagship anti-HIV programme by almost 40 per cent next year.

The long-running programme is estimated to have saved more than 20 million lives in the past two decades, and is often cited as one of the world's most successful public health schemes.

Experts worry reduced US aid could open the door for rival powers - including China and Russia - to increase their influence through their own investments and aid, reshaping global alliances.

Elon Musk's legal 130-day term as a ‘special government employee' is set to expire today after a controversial stint that will have a lasting impact both in the US and across the world.

Mr Musk's stated goal as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was to slash spending across the board, saving American taxpayers money by ending “waste, fraud, and abuse”.

He claimed he could cut $1 trillion from the federal budget before September 30, but the reported toll is far off that figure.

As of May 26, DOGE's online “wall of receipts” claims estimated savings of $175 billion since the start of Mr Trump's term, averaging $1,086.96 saved per taxpayer.

But analysis by the New York Times has spotted gaping holes in those claims.

This includes counting government contracts not yet awarded, contracts that ended years ago, triple-counting the same savings, and confusing “million” with “billion”.

DOGE has since corrected some of those errors, but many remain, leaving Mr Musk's governmental legacy in murky waters.

Republicans with close ties to Donald Trump might not be as willing to forget Elon Musk's series of sensationalist social media posts against the US president. 

Leading figures have pitched in their thoughts in the hours since the spat began.

“The president treated him almost like a son,” Steve Bannon, a long-time antagonist of Mr Musk, told Playbook yesterday. 

“He invited his family to Christmas dinner. He let him sleep over. He let him walk in and out of meetings. The president went to the max informality to welcome this guy.”

Bannon added: “You're going to tell me we should allow some fucking punk to sit there and say he should be impeached and JD (Vance) should step in? F--- you, dude. We're going to go to f------ war, and I'm going to rip your f------ face off.”

In one of his controversial posts on X, Elon Musk hit out at Donald Trump's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.

Ever since Epstein's crimes first came to light, the internet has been filled with conspiracy theories about Mr Trump's relationship with the convicted paedophile.

Mr Trump and Epstein's friendship stretched back decades: In 1997, the US smiled as he posed for a photograph with his old friend in Palm Beach.

At the time, the pair, who moved in the same wealthy social circles and bonded over their love of beautiful women, had been friends for years.

But when did their friendship begin and what are the finer details?

Read the full story here.

The Kremlin has said it would not get involved in Donald Trump's row with Elon Musk, but was confident that Mr Trump would deal with the situation.

The quarrel between the two was an internal US matter, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said this morning. 

Elon Musk's high-profile support of Donald Trump during his election campaign undoubtedly gave him a boost. 

Early on, Mr Musk offered his support for Mr Trump's policies on business deregulation, space exploration, and economic growth.

He generated high-profile endorsements, leveraging his influence in tech and media circles.

Public comments and interviews saw Mr Musk praise aspects of Mr Trump's agenda, lending credibility to the campaign among voters interested in innovation, space, and technology.

The once-strong alliance between President Trump and Mr Musk is unravelling, with insiders suggesting a breakup is imminent.

Mr Musk's explosive rift with the White House stems from longstanding tensions about his libertarian policies and his unpredictable behaviour, according to sources close to the president.

Interviews with a string of insiders reveal months of concern at Mr Musk's grandstanding behaviour and philosophical differences with people at the heart of the Trump administration.

Our Chief US Correspondent, Rob Crilley, has the full story here.

Mr Trump's new bill marks a major legislative move by the US president. Named the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act”, it encompasses significant tax reforms, spending cuts, and defence allocations.

The bill is the root of the tensions between Mr Musk and Mr Trump, with the Tesla boss claiming it will undo all of the cost-cutting he has initiated during his tenure at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Key provisions include:

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said today that he had “absolutely no doubt” that Mr Trump would keep the United States within the Nato military alliance.

“I have absolutely no doubt that the American government is sticking with Nato,” Mr Merz said in a speech at an entrepreneurs' event just hours after returning from his inaugural trip to Washington.

Tesla shares have risen after news that White House aides had scheduled a call with CEO Elon Musk in an effort to ease tensions.

The stock climbed about 5 per cent in Frankfurt, rebounding after a sharp 14.3 per cent drop in New York on Thursday that wiped out roughly $150 billion in market value.

“It's unlikely that Trump will end subsidies and contracts with Tesla. Those are obviously threats that are unlikely to come into fruition,” Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, told Reuters.

“I don't expect this to blow out into anything more serious than a war of words for a couple of days.”

Welcome to today's live coverage of the spat between Elon Musk and Donald Trump.

For those of you who are just joining us, the argument began yesterday when Mr Musk publicly criticised the US president's new spending bill.

The Tesla boss labelled the legislation a “disgusting abomination” before accusing Mr Trump of being named in documents relating to the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

Mr Musk added that Mr Trump would have lost the election without him and called for him to be impeached.

Mr Trump responded that his former ally was lashing out at his legislation because he did not “get his own way”.

Elon Musk called for the impeachment of Donald Trump after an explosive public fallout that exposed deep divisions.

The world's most powerful men entered a war of words on Thursday, trading insults from their respective social media platforms.

The row was sparked by tension over Mr Trump's flagship tax and spend bill he is trying to push through Congress.

Mr Musk suggested his former boss should be removed from office as disagreement escalated.

He responded “yes” to a user on X who wrote: “Trump should be impeached and JD Vance should replace him.”

He earlier wrote:

Time to drop the really big bomb:@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.Have a nice day, DJT!

Mr Trump in turn threatened to cancel all of the Tesla and SpaceX owner's government contracts, while Mr Musk said he would decommission his Dragon spacecraft which is used by Nasa to deliver and collect astronauts from the International Space Station.

The president's aides arranged a flurry of meetings to address the fallout, with White House staff reportedly preparing to force allies to pick sides between the president and his former adviser, according to The New York Times.

An administration official said Mr Musk is “clearly having an episode”.

Steve Bannon, Mr Trump's former adviser, encouraged the president to initiate a formal investigation into Mr Musk's immigration status and have him “deported from the country immediately”.

Mr Trump kicked off the verbal sparring during an Oval Office sit-down with the German chancellor earlier in the day, saying the Tesla boss had “Trump derangement syndrome”. Mr Musk shot back, saying the president only won the election because of his support.

“Without me, Trump would have lost the election. Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate... Such ingratitude,” he wrote on X.

Mr Musk then claimed that the president was named in the Epstein files, a term that has colloquially come to describe the classified intelligence the US holds on the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

Mr Trump and Epstein ran in the same social circles in New York and were pictured partying together on various occasions in the 1980s and 1990s.

Epstein killed himself in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges.

In February, Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, pledged to release the Epstein files, however the “phase one” documents she released to a hand-picked group of conservative influencers contained information that was largely already in the public domain.

Questions about Mr Trump and Mr Musk's broken friendship overshadowed the president's meeting with Friedrich Merz, the Germany chancellor, on Thursday, with the president saying his former ally was lashing out at his legislation because he did not get his own way.

Mr Trump said: “Elon was ‘wearing thin,' I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!”

The president also appeared to threaten to cut government contracts held by Mr Musk's companies, saying the easiest way for the US to save money would be “to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!”

Tesla shares tanked as the rift intensified. Investors in the electric car company, which closed down 14.3 per cent, fear that Mr Trump might hinder the roll-out of self-driving cars in the US, hitting the company's growth potential.

Mr Musk, who stepped down as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency last week, has called Mr Trump's tax and spending bill a “disgusting abomination” for increasing the national debt.

The president claimed the world's richest man was upset because an ally of his was not chosen for a role in the new Nasa administration and because the Bill meant the end of tax breaks for electric vehicles worth billions to his company.

“He knew it better than almost anybody, and he never had a problem until right after he left,” he said.

“And if you saw the statements he made about me … he said the most beautiful things about me, and he hasn't said bad about me personally... I'm very disappointed in Elon.”

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Mr Musk launched his tirade against the president because he is unhappy the “big, beautiful bill” eliminated tax credits for electric vehicles.

“This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,” she told CNN.

“The president is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again.”

Mr Trump added that Mr Musk was probably missing the Oval Office and the trappings of power.

“It's sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it,” he said. “But we have it with others, too. They leave and they wake up in the morning, and the glamour is gone.”

During Mr Musk's send-off ceremony in the Oval Office last Friday, Mr Trump said he was “not really leaving” and would continue to visit the White House.

Things quickly unravelled when Mr Musk posted criticism of the bill for more than six hours on Tuesday, particularly saying that it did not do enough to cut federal spending.

Independent analysts have warned that the bill's spending cuts were not balanced by tax breaks, meaning it would add more than $2 trillion to the national debt during the next decade.

Mr Musk's net worth plunged by billions of dollars on Thursday and Tesla shares closed 14.3 per cent down, with investors seemingly spooked by his spat with the US president.

He is still the world's richest man, but he lost $34 billion between markets opening and closing, according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, which marks the second-steepest fall in the index's history.

Late on Thursday, however, small signs of a truce between Mr Musk and the president began to emerge.

White House aides scheduled a phone call between the pair for Friday, according to Politico, which spoke to Mr Trump on Thursday.

When asked about the fallout, the US president told the outlet, “It's going very well, never done better”.

Mr Musk also appeared to walk back the threat to decommission the Dragon spacecraft.

When an X user suggested Mr Musk and Mr Trump “take a step back for a couple days”, the Tesla CEO wrote: “Good advice. Ok, we won't decommission Dragon.”

Bill Ackman, a billionaire hedge fund manager, also attempted to ease the tensions.

“I support @realDonaldTrump and @elonmusk and they should make peace for the benefit of our great country,” he wrote.

Mr Musk responded: “You're not wrong.”

Organizers in Louisiana are fighting the Trump administration's efforts to expand methane export infrastructure.

Promising U.S. “energy dominance,” the Trump administration is moving to accelerate fossil fuel production. Key to this agenda is the approval of liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities across Gulf Coast communities that are disproportionately Black, Brown, and low-income, long treated as expendable “sacrifice zones” by the fossil fuel industry.

Just recently, on May 23, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reauthorized the massive CP2 LNG in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, which will be the biggest LNG export facility in the U.S.

Local organizers and climate groups have been fighting the expansion of these “methane export facilities” which they say will intensify climate chaos and environmental racism. To try to halt them, they're focusing on key actors behind these fossil fuel projects: the big financiers and insurers whose services these projects need in order to gain regulatory approval and to be built and operated.

A new report by the Rainforest Action Network (RAN) maps out the known insurers of the buildout of LNG export facilities in Southwest Louisiana and discusses the numerous financial and reputational risks these companies face in propping up an industry tied to a volatile market fueling climate crisis and threatening local communities.

“They're financing and insuring environmental racism because these projects are overwhelmingly situated in Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities they feel are the path of least resistance,” Roishetta Ozane, founder of the Vessel Project in Lake Charles, Louisiana, told Truthout.

U.S. exports of LNG, or fracked gas that has been cooled into liquid to ship, have boomed over the past decade. LNG has been promoted by the fossil fuel industry as a cleaner “bridge fuel” toward renewable energy, a debunked claim that some view as a form of greenwashing. The production, transport, processing, and burning of fracked gas releases large amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas that is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.

The U.S. is the world's top exporter of fracked gas. In recent years, the fossil fuel industry and its Wall Street investors have sought to expand U.S. LNG export facilities. Immediately after his January 2025 inauguration, Donald Trump restarted applications for new LNG export terminals that were paused by Joe Biden a year earlier.

The epicenter of the buildout has been the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast, where there are currently around two dozen LNG expansion projects being constructed or proposed. These facilities are located in places like Port Arthur, Texas, and Cameron Parish, Louisiana, communities that are overwhelmingly Black, Brown, and low-income, and where clusters of toxic refining and petrochemical plants have long operated.

The United Nations has called areas like these “sacrifice zones,” defined as “extremely contaminated areas where vulnerable and marginalized groups bear a disproportionate burden of the health, human rights and environmental consequences of exposure to pollution and hazardous substances.” Research shows that local Black, Brown, and Indigenous workers do not benefit equitably from the jobs and other economic benefits the fossil fuel industry often promises when building new facilities.

A 2024 Greenpeace report found that the building of planned LNG projects would result annually in 149 premature deaths and $2.33 billion in health costs, with areas in Southwest Louisiana “slated to suffer the worst air pollution impacts per capita” and with air pollution from LNG terminals disproportionately affecting Black and Brown residents.

According to a new report by RAN, over 20 additional LNG expansion projects have been proposed in the Gulf Coast region in addition to six existing export terminals. These enormous projects have names like Sabine Pass LNG, Cameron LNG, and Calcasieu Pass LNG. Their corporate backers include Sempra, Energy Transfer, Cheniere, Kimmeridge, and Venture Global.

These facilities, however, are far from uncontested, facing major opposition from community organizers like Roishetta Ozane.

“I would say that if you insure CP2 you are insuring the death of my children and my community. We are already suffering from the pollution that's coming from the surrounding facilities. We can't take anymore.”

A mother of six who lives just outside Lake Charles, Louisiana, Ozane founded the Vessel Project in 2020 amid her efforts to help the community respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and displacement from Hurricanes Laura and Delta. The Vessel Project uses mutual aid to build community and create the conditions for sustained organizing for environmental justice.

“We make sure that people's immediate needs are met before we talk about stopping an LNG facility,” she told Truthout. “That way, we've been able to grow our base of community members who show up at meetings and town halls and who travel with us to D.C. or New York City.”

Ozane spoke of the environmental and health fallouts her community has suffered living “right in the midst of a mixture of industries,” including explosions, fires, and smoke clouds at petrochemical plants, with consequences for her own family. “We get all the cumulative impacts living in a fenceline community,” she said. “My children have asthma and eczema. My son has epilepsy, which I believe was exacerbated by the pollution from the facilities.”

As Ozane responded to crisis after crisis, she started making connections between the environmental racism and extreme weather her community experienced and the wider climate crisis tied to local industries. “I was trying to connect the dots for people,” she said. “All of these facilities are releasing gas into the air, and it's what's warming our planet. It's what's causing these storms to be more severe.”

Organizing to halt the buildout of LNG export facilities and other fossil fuel infrastructure has led Ozane and others toward a concerted strategy: pressuring big financiers and insurers to stop propping up these projects.

“The banks and the insurance companies are the ones actually supporting the fossil fuel industry behind the scenes,” Ruth Breech of RAN, and a coauthor of the RAN report, told Truthout.

The past decade has seen the climate and environmental justice movement target the money behind the fossil fuel industry, such as banks JPMorgan and Citi, asset managers like BlackRock and Vanguard, and insurers like AIG and Liberty Mutual. While ExxonMobil or Chevron may cling to its core business of oil and gas production, these financial firms are more diversified, risk-averse and susceptible to public shaming.

“If our elected officials are going to approve these projects, then our hope lies in the banks and the investors and the insurance companies,” said Ozane.

Ozane co-leads the Gulf South Fossil Finance Hub, a coalition aimed at bringing pressure from local communities to bear on these financial giants. “We bring frontline folks in front of these banks and insurance companies to say you're insuring and financing environmental racism,” she said.

More than any other financial backers, insurance corporations may be most vulnerable around fossil fuels, since climate chaos presents an existential threat to the industry's business model.

The RAN report, which the Vessel Project and Gulf South Fossil Finance Hub signed onto, maps out some of the known insurers, based on information from FOIA requests and lawsuit filings, behind Southwest Louisiana's LNG export buildout. For example, insurers behind Cameron LNG include Chubb, AIG, Allianz, Liberty Mutual, Munich Re, Swiss Re, Zurich, Tokio Marine, The Hartford, and others, according to RAN.

The report highlights the significant risks for insurers in underwriting the Gulf Coast LNG buildout, including financial instability tied to regulatory and construction delays and the problem of oversupply and overcapacity with these facilities. Multiple reports warn that U.S. shale production is facing decline in prices and market volatility.

The report also notes the reputational and financial risks to insurers that prop up an industry that perpetuates harmful health impacts, safety hazards, climate risks, and disruptions to local ecosystems. LNG export facilities have been plagued by thousands of permit violations and extensive operational problems and accidents, with one of the most infamous being a 2022 explosion and fire at Freeport LNG that led to an eight-month shutdown.

Both Breech and Ozane emphasized the hypocrisy behind the insurance industry's continued underwriting of fossil fuels. “We're seeing people across the nation lose their home insurance coverage because of the impacts of climate change,” said Breech. “Then we're seeing these insurance companies continue to provide insurance for new fossil fuel projects.”

Ozane said it's frustrating to see insurers prop up an industry in her community that is driving the very climate chaos that's making home insurance in Louisiana unaffordable. “For insurance companies to insure one of these climate monsters, and then turn around and not insure the people who live in the communities at a reasonable rate, is outright wrong,” she said.

For RAN and the Vessel Project, the global insurance powerhouse Chubb has been a key focus. Breech says Chubb CEO Evan Greenberg is “an influencer personality” within the insurance industry, similar to JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon in banking. Chubb has also been open to engaging with community members. Ozane has met with representatives from Chubb several times, bringing her children to the meetings. “They know me by name,” she says.

In 2024, Chubb reported dropping 32 major oil and gas clients who didn't meet its methane emissions standards. Chubb has dropped its coverage of the Rio Grande LNG, a proposed LNG export terminal in Brownsville, Texas, and it ruled out insuring the East African Crude Oil Pipeline. As recently reported by Inside Climate News, Chubb also dropped its coverage of Venture Global's Calcasieu Pass LNG.

But for organizers like Ozane, Chubb isn't going far enough. She wants them to rule out insuring another LNG export terminal, Venture Global's huge CP2, which just received FERC approval. Ozane told Truthout that she's currently trying to arrange a “toxic tour” for FERC so the commission can see the cumulative impacts of the fossil fuel industry on her community.

According to the Sierra Club LNG Export Tracker, CP2's annual emissions will be the equivalent of 54 coal burning power plants once two phases of expansion are completed.

CP2's insurers are currently unknown, RAN reports.

“If you're insuring this project, you're ensuring this community's destruction,” Ozane said. “It would be easy for Chubb to say, if CP2 gets all of its permits, we're not going to insure them.”

Truthout contacted Chubb to ask if the company was insuring CP2, and also if its decision to drop coverage of Calcasieu Pass LNG could mean Chubb would decide to not insure CP2, but received no response.

RAN told Truthout that it's demanding Chubb drop its coverage of Cameron LNG by June and Freeport LNG by October, and that it stops insuring all “methane terminals.”

Chubb CEO Evan Greenberg took in $82 million in total compensation between 2022 and 2024. By contrast, the per capita income in Lake Charles, Louisiana, is $35,847, with a poverty rate of 23.2 percent, according to census data.

The RAN report demands that banks and insurers stop supporting fossil fuel expansion projects. It also demands that banks and insurance companies “follow a human rights due diligence framework” and consult with community leaders and organizations from municipalities and parishes where LNG export facilities are being sited to identify and assess human rights risks, and for these companies to do their own site visits to conduct human rights, environmental and environmental justice assessments.

“We're talking about serious human rights implications in these projects,” said Breech. “Southwest Louisiana is not an energy sacrifice zone, and it's not acceptable to have all of these proposals in this area.”

With hurricane season approaching, Ozane stresses the urgency of halting the LNG export buildout that's blanketing her community. She is hosting a hurricane preparedness festival highlighting the intersection of fossil fuel pollution and climate-induced disasters.

Truthout asked Ozane what she would say to Chubb CEO Evan Greenberg if she could speak directly to him.

“I would say that if you insure CP2 you are insuring the death of my children and my community,” she said. “We are already suffering from the pollution that's coming from the surrounding facilities. We can't take anymore.”

Truthout also asked Ozane what victory would ultimately look like for her.

“Victory looks like we are no longer dependent on fossil fuels here and that there's another economy here,” she said. “We're back to our fishermen being able to live off of fishing and oysters and shrimping. We see a beautiful coast free of the industry that's now polluting the water.”

“Victory will look like my 7-year-old going outside to play without coming back into the house saying that he can't breathe,” she says.

The GOP budget's cuts to Medicaid threaten to decimate 59 trauma recovery centers in 15 states.

The GOP's proposed cuts to Medicaid could take away an important lifeline in the effort to combat violence. Despite significant reductions in violent crime since the pandemic, violence and the fear of violence remain a stubborn feature of daily life in too many communities across the U.S. A new strategy of using Medicaid funding to support community-based trauma counseling to reduce violence has growing support at the state level, but the Republican budget bill that passed the house would cut more than $800 billion in Medicaid funding over the next 10 years — and most likely close the door on this essential tool.

As experts on public safety, we have seen firsthand the importance of childhood trauma in driving violence. At Newark's HUBB Arts and Trauma Center (HUBB ATC) we see every day the struggles of young people to overcome trauma in their daily lives and to take the difficult steps needed to break the cycle of violence.

Both of us experienced untreated childhood traumas and understand the need for services tailored to young people's experiences. At 15, Alex Vitale was stabbed by a home intruder. While the police and an ambulance arrived quickly and a report was taken and medical care given, no efforts were made to provide follow up mental health care. For years, he suffered from anxiety and slept with a weapon next to his bed.

As a child, Al-Tariq Best endured a range of traumatic experiences, including domestic violence, murder, drug exposure, and sexual abuse. He witnessed firsthand the physical abuse his mother suffered at the hands of her partners. After his mother made the difficult decision to leave and eventually divorce his father, they became entangled with another abusive man who inflicted relentless physical, emotional, and psychological abuse upon the family.

Growing up in this chaos fostered a dangerous normalization of abuse, contributing to their own emotional insecurities and distorted perceptions of relationships. As they matured into adulthood, this unresolved trauma often manifested as anger and unhealthy dynamics in their own relationships.

Research into violent crime has shown that past trauma plays a major role in predicting future violence, especially among young people. When people are exposed to or directly experience traumatic events such as suffering domestic violence, witnessing a shooting, or even regularly hearing about the violent deaths of friends and family members, it can lead to forms of post-traumatic stress, similar to that seen in combat veterans. This stress can lead to irritability, interrupted sleep, inability to concentrate, and heightened levels of fear and anxiety, all of which are associated with higher risk of involvement in violence.

Children are especially susceptible to this dynamic. Children are more likely to live in extreme poverty and be exposed to domestic abuse and community violence. Over 20 percent of children in the U.S. grow up in poverty, and youth violence is heavily concentrated within exactly this population. At the same time, they are less well equipped to manage this trauma because they are still developing emotionally and intellectually, making them more likely to engage in impulsive and poorly thought-out behavior. This contributes not just to higher levels of violence but also to suicides and harmful substance use.

Over the last decade, new efforts have emerged to address trauma at the community level as part of an overall strategy to reduce community violence. Trauma recovery centers (TRCs) have been created across the U.S. that put clinical mental health workers in community-based settings to engage with people who have suffered trauma. The National Alliance of Trauma Recovery Centers reports that there are 59 such centers in 15 states that attempt to overcome the stigma too often associated with receiving mental health services.

In New Jersey, Newark Community Street Team, a community-based violence reduction program created in 2014, opened its Trauma Recovery Center in 2020 and serves people who have experienced a broad range of traumas at no cost. The Grady TRC in Atlanta is based at a local hospital and helps people who have been the victims of violence get their lives back on track through medical services, psychological therapy, and essential social services that often harness victim services resources. The Downtown Women's Center operated by UC San Francisco in Los Angeles specializes in assisting women victims of violence in English and Spanish, regardless of immigration status.

Several states have attempted to support this work by authorizing TRCs to bill Medicaid for the delivery of these essential health services. Medicaid provides medical coverage for the poor and disabled through grants to states, which then decide how best to spend the money within federal guidelines. Medicaid is an essential source of revenue for funding hospitals and clinics in poor and underserved communities. California, Oregon, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, and Illinois have all passed laws enabling TRCs to receive Medicaid reimbursements for their work. This has allowed for a significant expansion of services in these states as part of the effort to break the cycle of violence.

While some existing TRCs in the U.S. serve children, many do not, and none exclusively serve youth. The HUBB ATC that Al-Tariq Best founded wants to change that. It has served young people in Newark at high risk of involvement in violence since 2013 by utilizing a mixture of arts programing, mentoring, social services, and mental health support to stabilize young people in crisis. The HUBB ATC is part of a citywide effort to build community capacity to stop violence outside the traditional use of police, courts, and prisons. Together, these groups have helped drive down violent crime in Newark to historic lows.

While The HUBB ATC has long employed licensed mental health workers to help young people in crisis, the need is much greater than the current capacity. Over the last few years, the organization has received grants and in-kind donations to build out a multifaceted youth trauma center that would allow for both situational and intensive long-term therapeutic interventions.

Unfortunately, operational funding has failed to materialize. New Jersey has been considering a bill to allow the use of Medicaid reimbursements, but that bill is likely to be moot given the massive cuts to Medicaid contained in the GOP budget bill. The proposed $800 billion reduction would make expansion in Medicaid coverage highly unlikely since states will be under huge pressure to make up for the forthcoming shortfalls.

Hopefully the Senate will take steps to block the Medicaid cuts and New Jersey and other states can move forward with this essential service that will both improve the mental health of young people and help reduce violence. Otherwise, it will be up to local and state governments as well as philanthropy to try and make up the difference. The evidence is clear that youth violence is a public health issue that is best dealt with through community-centered behavioral health interventions and social services, not more intensive policing and mass incarceration.

Backed by nearly two dozen House Democrats, the new bill would end the US supply of offensive weapons to Israel.

With over 54,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip killed by the Israeli assault and the 2 million survivors suffering from the ongoing bombings and blockade on essentials, nearly two dozens progressives in the U.S. Congress came together Thursday to call for passage of a bill that would withhold offensive weapons from Israel.

Like former Democratic U.S. President Joe Biden, Republican President Donald Trump has continued to provide diplomatic and weapons support to the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose forces have left the Palestinian enclave in ruins since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.

“Netanyahu and Trump are a lethal, unaccountable, extremist duo. Trump has bypassed congressional oversight on weapons transfers. The Israeli government is currently escalating attacks on the civilian population of Gaza. They are both out of control. Congress needs to assert its oversight authority,” said Congresswoman Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.) in a statement.

“Enough is enough,” Ramirez declared. “By introducing the Block the Bombs Act, a broad coalition is listening to the American people who don't want their taxpayers' money to continue supporting gross violations of U.S., international, and humanitarian law.”

Two former leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus — Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) — as well as Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) are spearheading the fight for the bill alongside Ramirez. Another 18 Democrats in the House of Representatives have signed on as co-sponsors, including current CPC Chair Greg Casar (D-Texas) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), the only Palestinian American in either chamber.

“For the last year and a half, Benjamin Netanyahu has laid siege to Gaza, killing at least 54,000 people, repeatedly displacing the entire population, and cutting off access to desperately needed humanitarian aid,” said Pocan. “This commonsense bill will prevent more unchecked transfers of these offensive weapons systems that are used to violate international human rights laws and hopefully help bring this devastating conflict to an end.”

Although there was a cease-fire in place for nearly two months earlier this year, Netanyahu abandoned it in March. Since then, negotiations for an end to Israel's annihilation of Gaza and the release of both Palestinians held in Israeli prisons and hostages taken by Palestinian militants in 2023 have been unsuccessful.

Throughout the war, efforts by progressives in both chambers of Congress — including multiple resolutions led by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — to block U.S. weapons that Israel uses to massacre civilians in Gaza also have not been successful. A growing number of critics across the globe condemn the U.S.-backed Israeli assault as genocide.

This morning @ramirez.house.gov, @sarajacobs.house.gov, @jayapal.house.gov, and @pocan.house.gov introduced historic legislation to stop sending bombs to the Israeli military. It should be common sense. We should not be supporting mass killing and starvation. Thank you all for your leadership.

The new bill is backed by dozens of advocacy groups that have spent the past 20 months sounding the alarm about the soaring death toll, starvation, and destruction of infrastructure in Gaza, including Amnesty International USA, Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), Council on American-Islamic Relations, Demand Progress, Human Rights Watch, IfNotNow Movement, IMEU Policy Project, Indivisible, Jewish Voice for Peace Action, Justice Democrats, Institute for Policy Studies, Progressive Democrats of America, Rabbis for Cease-Fire, Sunrise Movement, Win Without War, and Working Families Party.

“The Block the Bombs Act is a historic bill,” but also “a straightforward challenge to United States complicity in Israel's genocidal campaign in Gaza as Israeli forces block humanitarian assistance and directly target schools, hospitals, and civilians,” said CCR associate director of policy Brad Parker. “As the Israeli government escalates the murder, starvation, and forcible transfer of Palestinians with President Trump's full support, we recognize and appreciate the bold leadership of Reps. Ramirez, Jacobs, Jayapal, and Pocan.”

CCR also encouraged supporters of the bill to visit blockthebombs.org, which features a tool enabling U.S. voters to write to their members of Congress and ask them to co-sponsor the legislation, H.R. 3565.

MALCOLM TURNBULL was Prime Minister of Australia from 2015 to 2018.

 Malcolm Turnbull

Since returning to office, U.S. President Donald Trump has assailed the world order created by the United States after World War II. He has challenged the sovereignty of allies and partners by threatening to acquire Greenland, annex Canada, and seize the Panama Canal. His global trade war is designed to benefit the United States at the expense of all its trading partners. He has withdrawn from the Paris climate accord and the World Health Organization. In dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Trump administration has abandoned long-standing bipartisan commitments to international development. And his treatment of Ukraine—his attempt to hound the Ukrainians toward a peace deal rather than use American might to compel Russia to the table—humiliated the weaker and wronged party and courted the aggressor.

Trump believes that might makes right. As he posted in April on Truth Social, “THE GOLDEN RULE OF NEGOTIATING AND SUCCESS: HE WHO HAS THE GOLD MAKES THE RULES.”

The world order and the institutions the United States created after World War II were all designed to resist that logic, and to ensure that the strong could not simply do what they can and force the weak to suffer as they must. But Trump has no time for such high-mindedness. Instead, he has vindicated the cynical view that the United States was never the altruistic and idealistic power it claimed to be.

For those who still believe in a principled and generous United States, this is a traumatic moment of cognitive dissonance. The reality of Trump's administration—the contempt for law both at home and abroad, the bullying, the abrogation of agreements and treaties, the threats against allies, and the cuddling up to tyrants—is plain to see. But it still seems incredible. Some observers search for a benign explanation. Perhaps, they imagine, Trump is playing four-dimensional chess and his outrageous actions are just part of a shrewd master plan. Others cling to the hope that something will change the course of events, a plot twist to keep things on track before the show goes off the rails.

But hope is a dangerous comforter in times like these. Trump is the new normal in Washington. At least until the next presidential election, there does not appear to be a reversal in sight.

This does not mean that U.S. allies should surrender to Trump's intimidation. Together, they can exert considerable influence and contend with the havoc unleashed by Washington. Those countries that share the values for which the United States once stood, but currently does not, should band together to preserve what worked best in the order Trump is intent on burying. As French President Emmanuel Macron said last week, U.S. allies should build a coalition of countries that “will not be bullied.”

In the era of “America first,” the United States is not, and does not purport to be, the reliable security partner it once was. Allies around the world have recognized they have to do more to defend themselves. They must acquire more advanced weapons systems, deeper stocks of ammunition and equipment, and recruit more personnel. At the same time, they have to increase their “sovereign autonomy,” notably their ability to operate without the concurrence or cooperation of the United States. They also must develop and strengthen alliances with like-minded partners other than the United States.

Such moves would not constitute a rejection of the United States but rather follow from precisely what the Trump administration is inviting allies to do. In an interview in April, Vice President JD Vance praised the French leader Charles de Gaulle who, despite protests from Washington in the 1960s, ensured that France, unlike the United Kingdom, retained complete sovereignty over all its military capabilities, including its nuclear arsenal. As Vance put it, de Gaulle understood “that it's not in Europe's interest, nor America's interest, for Europe to be a permanent security vassal of the United States.”

The message from Washington has shifted markedly. Trump is not the first president to say allies should make a larger contribution to mutual defense. But to many allies, he seems to be saying they should spend more because they may well be on their own.

Consider Trump's treatment of Ukraine. In the early months of his second term, Trump appeared to have effectively changed sides in the war in Ukraine, favoring Russia and bullying Ukraine into accepting a peace on the terms preferred by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Unfortunately for Trump, three months of appeasement have not ended the war. He may eventually stand up to Putin, or he could simply leave Ukraine to its fate.



Apart from Ukraine, European countries face the most urgent threat from Russia. The European members of NATO have the economic capacity to match and outmatch Russia if they choose to do so. As Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk recently asked, “Why do 500 million Europeans need 330 million Americans to defend them against 140 million Russians?”

NATO and all U.S. allies, including Australia, recognize the need to spend more. But Washington and allied capitals differ on how that extra cash should be spent. The United States naturally wants additional purchases of American weapons. But allies fear that although buying more U.S. equipment and munitions may please Trump, it will not deliver greater independence. Indeed, a buying spree of U.S. weapons systems may result only in the purchaser becoming even more reliant on the United States.

The long-term solution for U.S. allies is to be able to deter aggressors with capabilities that are sovereign, ideally in the sense that they have been produced domestically but certainly in the sense that they can be deployed and operated without the concurrence of the United States. At the moment, that is not possible. U.S.-supplied F-35s, for instance, are so functionally dependent on American software and spare parts that it is difficult to see how they could be used, or used for long, without Washington's consent.

This kind of dependence, common in most modern weapons systems, was often irksome for U.S. allies but not regarded as a big problem. NATO allies could trust that they would never fight alone, so dependence on an indifferent United States was merely a theoretical concern. But today, with the White House demanding that the United States' allies be able to fend for themselves, the circumstances are very different. It is no surprise that the EU's recently unveiled 150 billion euro defense procurement plan largely excludes U.S. companies. At the same time, Portugal has announced it is no longer planning to acquire F-35s, and Canada is reassessing its plans to purchase 88 F-35s. Europe's challenge is not just to find the money to fund rearmament but also to overcome national rivalries to agree on several standard-bearers for the defense industry, much in the same way that France and Germany came together to create Airbus in 1970. Another inspiring example for Europe (and other U.S. allies) can be found in Ukraine, where the local defense industry has produced one disruptive, innovative, and much less costly capability after another—as demonstrated by the stunning drone attacks that Ukrainian forces launched earlier this week on Russian air bases.

In Europe, U.S. allies are geographically close to one another and have strong strategic and economic ties. The situation is very different in the Indo-Pacific. On the one hand, China is far stronger relative to its Asian neighbors than Russia is to its European ones. On the other hand, although Trump has given the Europeans cause for concern that they could be on their own, he has not yet suggested that the United States would abandon its allies in Asia.

The obvious flash point is Taiwan, where the signals from the Trump administration are decidedly mixed. Trump himself has said that Taiwan is difficult to defend and has complained about its semiconductor manufacturing industry, claiming the island “stole the chip business” from the United States and should pay for U.S. protection. But speaking recently at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Trump has made it clear that “Communist China will not invade Taiwan on his watch” and that the United States would work to make the costs of an invasion too high for China, ensuring that peace in the Taiwan Strait was the only option.

That confidence is belied by events on the ground. Chinese exercises around Taiwan look more and more like rehearsals for an invasion. Hegseth himself acknowledged in his speech that an attack could be imminent. Taiwanese politics are unstable, with no consensus on the need to increase defense spending, and there are a range of coercive measures short of kinetic conflict that could enable Chinese leader Xi Jinping to win Taiwan without firing a shot.

Notwithstanding Hegseth's fighting words in Singapore, Taiwan is both closer and far more important to Beijing than it is to Washington. If Ukraine is not Trump's war (as he so often insists), he would likely not risk war with China over Taiwan—a war that even if it remained conventional would result in the destruction of much of the U.S. and Chinese navies. With more than 200 times the shipbuilding capacity of the United States, China could replace its losses long before the United States was able to do so. A Chinese takeover of Taiwan will cause U.S. allies in the region to lose confidence in the notion of an American security umbrella and the effectiveness of U.S. deterrence, which is measured not just in firepower but also in willpower.



Although they would be immediately threatened, Japan and South Korea each have the economic power to considerably increase their own defense capabilities. South Korea is already a major defense exporter. And both countries host U.S. military bases with significant capabilities. But if they lose confidence in Washington's will to fight in Asia, those bases could become liabilities, making it harder for each country to manage its own defense and diplomacy without the concurrence of the United States. The same logic that Vance used to praise de Gaulle's France would be applied to Japan and South Korea. There is no substitute for establishing sovereign autonomy. Both countries could conclude that it would be best to possess a nuclear deterrent of their own.

Elsewhere in Asia, Southeast Asian countries are too diverse in their geopolitical orientations to collaborate on defense. Several, such as Laos and Myanmar, are already closely aligned with China. Others benefit from having to hedge between China and the United States. But all would likely fall within China's sphere of influence if the United States were to abandon the region.

Consider the case of the Philippines, a formal treaty ally of the United States. The Philippines has been subjected to increasing incursions from China as Beijing asserts its claims in the South China Sea. But even though the United States has a mutual defense treaty with the Philippines, it has done little more than protest as China builds and militarizes artificial islands and even spars directly with Philippine vessels. In the absence of firm U.S. support, the Philippines will inevitably feel compelled to accommodate China's demands.

In recent years, Australia has become more dependent on the United States even as the United States has become less dependable. This dynamic is most glaring when it comes to the formation of AUKUS, a 2021 security partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Australia canceled a program to build 12 diesel electric submarines with France in favor of eight nuclear-powered but conventionally armed attack submarines to be built with the United Kingdom. These vessels will not be ready, however, until the 2040s. To bridge the gap between the retirement of Australia's aging submarine fleet and its future acquisitions, officials agreed that the United States would sell Australia three to five Virginia-class submarines by around 2032. But U.S. legislation pertaining to AUKUS specifically states that the submarines cannot be sold unless the president certifies that their sale will not degrade U.S. underwater capabilities. Given the U.S. Navy is about 20 attack submarines short of what it says it requires and U.S. shipbuilders are constructing only about half as many submarines as the U.S. Navy needs to replace old ones, it seems unlikely that Australia will ever get any Virginias of its own in the era of “America first.”

When the AUKUS submarine deal was agreed to in 2021, an understandably angry French foreign minister said, “Australia has sacrificed sovereignty for the sake of security. It is likely to lose both.” AUKUS may be a cautionary tale for other allies. Sovereignty and autonomy are more important than ever. Compromise them at your peril.

In trade, too, Trump has sought to upend existing partnerships and alliances. His bullying tariff policy is intended to assert American power and extract significant concessions from others, all at the expense of the trading system the United States helped build. “These countries,” Trump said in April, “are calling us up, kissing my ass. . . . They are dying to make a deal.”

My view, based on experience with Trump, is that pandering to him is precisely the wrong way to go. Trump's agenda is to use tariffs to force importers to move their production to the United States. Of course, this approach defies basic principles of economics. Take Canada, from which the United States imports about 40 percent of its aluminum. The production of aluminum requires prodigious quantities of cheap energy. Canada has vast hydropower resources, and as a result, the energy costs of its large aluminum industry are a third of those of the U.S. aluminum industry. Canada has a natural comparative advantage. The 50 percent (up from 25 percent) tariff Trump has imposed on aluminum will increase the price of aluminum within the United States, benefiting only U.S. aluminum producers at the expense of consumers and manufacturers.

Trump does not believe in comparative advantage. Rather, if a country has a trade deficit, it's a loser. If it has a trade surplus, it's a winner. I remember meeting him in Manila in November 2017 when I was prime minister of Australia. He was complaining bitterly about the size of the U.S. trade deficit with China. He asked me what would happen if he banned all Chinese imports. I quietly replied, “A global depression.” That might be a price he is willing to pay, but the rest of the world should not let U.S. policy send the global economy into a tailspin.

Those countries that still believe in free trade need to work together to promote new free-trade arrangements (and extend existing ones) that do not involve the United States. Consider, for instance, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, the successor to the TPP. Trump withdrew from the TPP after reaching the White House in 2017. Most believed the deal was dead. Several TPP members, including Japan, were very skeptical about the possibility of concluding an agreement without the United States. Some were anxious that such a move would offend Trump. I was able to persuade Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that he should not be concerned on that score. Moreover, the United States could one day change its mind; by keeping the deal alive we would, effectively, preserve the possibility of an American return.



By early 2018, the Trans-Pacific Partnership had lost one member and gained two adjectives; the now 11-member Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership was born. The United Kingdom has acceded to the trade pact and several other major economies, including China, South Korea, Indonesia, and Taiwan, have expressed interest in joining. The CPTPP was the most significant international trade agreement ever negotiated since the completion of the Uruguay round of talks in 1994 that resulted in the creation of the World Trade Organization. It was agreed even as a protectionist tide was rising in countries around the world. Unlike traditional trade deals, the CPTPP doesn't simply reduce tariffs on goods but sets binding rules on digital trade, e-commerce, data flows, and the protection of intellectual property. It enforces core labor rights, including the right to form independent trade unions, and prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of characteristics such as race, religion, and gender. And it obliges parties to avoid favoring their state-owned enterprises in a way that disadvantages foreign competitors. The CPTPP stands as a bold reply to Trump's rejection of multilateral trade leadership. Its members showed that they could reduce their exposure to U.S. political instability and trade unilateralism and at the same demonstrate that global rule-setting can proceed without American participation or consent.

U.S. allies need to find alternatives to the power of the U.S. market. The Europeans already have their own vast free-trade zone, but they are seeking to establish more free-trade relationships with others. EU-Australian trade negotiations, begun in 2017 but suspended in 2023 over agricultural exports, have been revived. And as Macron said in Singapore in May, the EU is seeking to forge new trade agreements with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and perhaps even join or associate with the CPTPP.

Two staunch U.S. allies in East Asia—Japan and South Korea—are seeking closer relationships with China. As speculation about Trump's tariffs swirled in March, the three countries' foreign ministers agreed to “comprehensive and high-level” negotiations toward a free-trade deal. Such an agreement would help build “a predictable trade and investment environment” in the midst of the volatility unleashed by Washington. Trump can take credit for bringing these three countries closer together; given their historical enmities, that would be a considerable (if unintended) achievement.

China stands to gain immensely from the vagaries of Trump's foreign policy. It has always bristled at how the United States and its dollar dominate the global system of trade and finance. That preeminence is being shaken not by anything China has done but by Trump's actions. The chaos in the bond markets after Trump's tariff announcements in April showed that there is waning confidence in U.S. stability and power.

Consider the folly of Trump's treatment of Australia. The United States enjoys a large trade surplus with Australia; in Trump's terms, the United States is already winning this bilateral relationship. It has no better ally or trade partner. And yet he chose to impose an across-the-board ten percent tariff on Australian goods and a 25 (now 50) percent tariff on Australian steel and aluminum at the same time as Washington is trying to line up allies against China. A third of Australia's exports go to China. In these circumstances, Canberra will be reluctant to hew more closely to Washington's line. Slowing the growth of China's economy (and its demand for Australian resources) is hardly in Australia's interest.

Trump does not pretend he is trying to bring about truly fair trade or a level playing field. His goal is to reindustrialize the United States, to bring factories back from China, Europe, and Southeast Asia. And he wants to assert American hegemony in the Western Hemisphere even as he unwinds U.S. involvement in the rest of the world. Voters in the United States will have to decide eventually whether these are plausible or worthwhile goals, but U.S. allies should already have made up their minds.

U.S. allies often trusted in the United States and in American values more in hope than in expectation. But that trust was real, and now it is fraying. Trump invites a different sort of trust in the United States: the certainty that Washington will seek to act ruthlessly in its own self-interest and use its might to extract the best deal for itself. Future U.S. leaders may try to restore the country's moral leadership, but trust once lost is hard to win back. Trade deals come and go, but if the light on the hill shines only for Americans, Trump will have ushered in a darker world for everybody else.

President Donald Trump's tariffs have forced a global reckoning. For Japan and many other countries, the vulnerability that comes with relying on U.S. markets has become startlingly clear. First came tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico. Then, in February, the administration introduced a 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminum (this week, it raised those tariffs to 50 percent). In March, it imposed a 25 percent tariff on automobiles and auto parts. And in April, Trump announced so-called reciprocal tariffs that imposed a base tariff of ten percent on imports from all countries plus additional duties on a country-by-country basis. The country-specific tariffs were paused for 90 days, until July. Along with various tariffs targeting Canada, China, and Mexico, they are now in legal limbo after a U.S. federal court ruled last week that the president had overstepped his authority in imposing them.

For the countries affected by U.S. tariffs, the potential economic harms are far too great to simply hope that an American court will make the problem go away or that the president will change his mind. Japan, in particular, is dangerously exposed to the U.S. market—but as the fourth-largest economy in the world, with relationships across the globe, Japan also has the resources and opportunity to craft an effective multilateral strategy for coping with Washington's obstructionist approach to trade.

If all of Trump's proposed measures enter force, Japan faces a 25 percent tariff on automobiles and auto parts, a 50 percent tariff on steel and aluminum, and a 24 percent tariff on all other goods it exports to the United States. Japan's economy depends on exports. The United States is its second-largest market, after China (including Hong Kong), accounting for roughly 20 percent of all exports, and steep tariffs would make many Japanese goods too expensive for American consumers. Tariffs on automobiles and auto parts are especially damaging, as these goods represent more than a third of Japan's exports to the United States. Japan's top 1,000 companies expect a seven percent drop in their total profits between April 2025 and March 2026, after making continuous gains since 2020.

Even if Tokyo can negotiate with Trump to secure tariff exemptions, significant harm has already been done. Many countries, including Japan, have lost confidence in the long-term openness of the U.S. market. It has become too risky to rely too much on trade with the United States. The erosion of multilateral institutions under both Trump administrations has slowed the expansion of trade and weakened the enforcement of trade rules for all. And the effort to build secure supply chains for critical minerals and clean energy products—reducing dependence on China for these vital goods and inputs—has grown more challenging as the United States puts up barriers to trade.

Japan and other countries in a similar position now need to take action that does not depend on working with the United States. Trump may be hostile to trade, but that does not change the fundamental economic reality that trade fuels growth. Nor has the need to reduce critical dependencies disappeared. To offset the damage of Trump's tariffs, Japan will have to expand its own trade relationships and collaborate with other countries to strengthen the global trade system with or without the United States—at least for now.

A key part of Japan's strategy must be to make up for a potentially substantial loss of exports to the U.S. market by increasing trade elsewhere. Outreach efforts can lay the groundwork. The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry and the Japan External Trade Organization must organize more business networking events, trade shows, and other trade promotion activities to help build new connections in non-U.S. markets. Sending cabinet ministers can demonstrate Japan's commitment to develop economic relationships with countries where Japanese companies have previously had fewer ties. India, for example, and many countries across Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East represent opportunities for trade expansion, once official visits smooth the way. China must be included on the travel agenda, too. In the past few years, political disagreements have strained economic relations between Japan and China; foreign direct investment from Japan to China has been shrinking since 2021. Hosting senior Chinese leaders in Tokyo and sending senior Japanese leaders to Beijing can help rebuild warmer relations and encourage businesses in both countries to expand their ties. There are already signs of such improvement: at a high-level meeting in Beijing last week, China agreed to resume imports of Japanese marine products, which China had banned in 2023, citing concerns about the release of treated wastewater from Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency.

The next step is formalizing new and deepened trade relationships with free trade agreements. A good place to start would be to build on an existing regional deal, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, which includes all ten members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea. The signatories to RCEP represent around 30 percent of global GDP and 30 percent of the global population. Trade liberalization under RCEP is modest compared with other free trade agreements, but multiple bilateral arrangements within it have reduced tariffs on a broad array of products, and it is the only existing framework for reducing tariffs among China, Japan, and South Korea.



The sense of alarm that the first Trump administration's trade restrictions generated across Asia played a key role in building support for the RCEP in 2020. Today's concerns are far greater and could drive a renewed effort to strengthen the trade agreement. The question is, how? Endless product-by-product negotiations to reduce tariffs among RCEP members will not help countries now facing severe economic harm from U.S. tariffs. To speed up the process, the signatories should start with negotiations to establish a formula for tariff reduction. RCEP already divides goods into four categories. Tariffs on some products, often those that member countries do not produce in meaningful quantities, are eliminated right away because no special interests block their removal. In another category, political considerations make it difficult to reduce tariffs—Japan's farm lobby strongly opposes tariff reductions on rice, for instance. In the final two groups of products, tariffs will be either reduced or eliminated over an agreed time frame.

Using this structure, RCEP countries can negotiate a formula to set more ambitious goals. They can pledge to shorten the time frames for reducing or eliminating tariffs by a certain percentage, lower tariff reduction levels further by a certain percentage, and shift a certain percentage of products from the tariff reduction category to the tariff elimination category. These commitments would be accepted by all members and applied to them equally. If a country cannot satisfy these conditions for tariffs on a particular product, it could request an exception in exchange for concessions on other goods. Recognizing that not all RCEP signatories are starting with the same degree of openness to trade, this approach—unlike an attempt to apply a single tariff rate cut across the board—would accommodate the different political sensitivities and stages of development of member countries. Ultimately, lowering tariffs on a broad array of products will help RCEP members quickly diversify their markets and expand their trade.

Japan should also look beyond RCEP. Previously, Japan has not had highly developed trade ties in Latin America or the Middle East because of geographical distance and the lack of strong historical ties. But Trump's tariffs could push Japan to explore these markets as it seeks opportunities to expand and diversify its trade. In particular, Tokyo should pursue trade agreements with the South American trade bloc Mercosur (composed of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay) and the Gulf Cooperation Council (composed of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates), both of which boast vibrant economic activity, population growth, and rising living standards, making them attractive trade partners.

Another part of Japan's strategy must be to strengthen international trade rules and institutions that have been weakened by Trump. In Trump's first term, his administration blocked the appointment of new members to the World Trade Organization's appellate body, which is the core of its dispute settlement process. Those seats remain unfilled. The first Trump administration also imposed tariffs on China in the name of national security, but in doing so grossly overstretched the exceptions allowed for national security under WTO rules. When the world's biggest economy disregards the norms of the international trade system in this way, other countries will find easy excuses for not following the same rules.

Today's tariffs further undermine the WTO-based system. But the WTO, although imperfect, is still important. A foundational principle of the agreements undergirding the WTO is “most favored nation” status, which requires all WTO members to apply the same trade terms to all their trading partners, with some limited exceptions. Before Trump unveiled his “reciprocal tariffs” in April, according to the WTO, 80 percent of global trade was conducted under “most favored nation” terms. That figure dropped to 74 percent with Trump's announcement—still the vast majority of global trade.

The countries that operate under WTO rules should now try to make those rules work better, even if that means working without the United States for now. The first step is to address the nonfunctional dispute settlement mechanism. Because Washington will not lift its block on appellate body appointments, other WTO members will have to agree to be bound by the decisions made through an alternative process. A new appeals system for trade disputes known as the Multi-Party Interim Appeal Arbitration Arrangement already has 56 members on board, including Canada, China, Japan, and the European Union. The more large economies—such as India, Indonesia, South Korea, and the United Kingdom—that participate, the stronger this alternative process will become.



Member countries can also create new rules within the WTO, as they have done in agreements on e-commerce and facilitating investment for development. Further discussions should explore additional rules to balance climate, development, and trade priorities, such as a code of conduct for carbon border adjustment mechanisms. The problem, however, is that these processes are time-consuming and incremental—and that, in the end, formalizing WTO rules requires consensus. Dozens of WTO members have signed on to the e-commerce and investment facilitation agreements, and in both cases, a few countries, including India and South Africa, have blocked that process. It may not be possible to convince these countries to accept new agreements, even if accepting them does not require that they participate in them.

Nor is it possible to develop an alternative system to the WTO from scratch within any reasonable time frame. But an existing trade pact can complement its functions: the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership can provide a framework for ambitious trade liberalization and rigorous rules, covering a broad swath of the world. The CPTPP is the successor agreement to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement signed in 2016 by 12 countries—Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States, and Vietnam. The United States never ratified the agreement, and Trump formally withdrew the country in 2017. In 2018, the 11 remaining members, led by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, revived the deal as CPTPP. Even without the United States, CPTPP members represent a combined 14 percent of global GDP. The pact significantly reduces barriers to trade, including tariffs, and enforces rules governing intellectual property, government procurement, investment, and more. It also has a process for settling trade disputes among its members. In a sense, CPTPP is an alternate WTO, or a “super WTO”—a much smaller club, but with deeper trade liberalization and higher regulatory standards.

CPTPP is already expanding beyond the Pacific region, adding the United Kingdom in 2024. Countries in Asia such as Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand are natural candidates and should be encouraged to participate. They will have to satisfy entry criteria and be accepted by the current members, which should be achievable. To serve as a global trade framework, however, CPTPP will need to expand farther—particularly to EU and non-EU countries in Europe, such as Norway and Switzerland, all of which should be able to qualify for entry. The EU itself is a rule-making institution, which may make its members wary of joining CPTPP. But the benefits of participating in a much larger trade bloc that supplements the weakened WTO system should outweigh any downside for Europe of negotiating trade rules with CPTPP members.

Bold but pragmatic measures are necessary to strengthen the multilateral trading system amid the latest U.S. efforts to undermine it. No country can achieve economic security alone, not even the United States; resilient supply chains depend on having reliable partners to trade with. Trade is the best way to avoid overdependence on any one country, whether that is dependence on exports to a United States that may impose steep tariffs at any time or dependence on China for supplies of critical minerals and clean energy products.

Trump's tariffs complicate international efforts to reduce this dependence on China. In recent years, the United States had been leading multilateral efforts to develop alternative supply chains for critical minerals and clean energy technologies. But tariffs will erect walls that break those links. If Washington will not be a reliable partner, other countries will need to build these supply chains among themselves. Japan has already been working with Australia and India to source rare earths. But Tokyo should be doing more. Japan's friends in Asia, as well as Canada and countries across Africa, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East, could all play a role in developing critical mineral and clean energy supply chains.

All of these measures to strengthen global trade rules and shore up critical supply chains would have a much greater effect if the United States were to join. That door should remain wide open, but merely hoping for the United States to change its thinking is not a strategy. Japan and like-minded countries need to mitigate the damage of U.S. tariffs—current and potential—and in the process find ways to expand trade and boost their economic security while augmenting the international trade system. If the rest of the world demonstrates that it can cooperate and prosper without the United States, future American leaders and the American people may come to see the benefits of participating in global initiatives once again. That outcome would be good for Japan, good for the world, and even good for the United States.

            The most powerful alliance in US politics crumbled in real-time on Thursday, with President Donald Trump and Elon Musk lobbing political barbs and personal insults at each other from their respective social media platforms.
    


            The pair's biggest media allies at Fox News — the most-watched cable news network on the planet, often viewed as a clearinghouse for the MAGA agenda — seem to be having a little difficulty with the breakup.
    


            Since Thursday afternoon, the network's MAGA-aligned opinion personalities have largely mourned the feud and appeared torn between their two central heroes, at times openly imploring them through the TV screen to reconcile.
    


            Will Cain lamented that the feud is “not a story that we wanted today for America.”
    


            Greg Gutfeld demanded the pair “knock it off” and make up. Don't “sabotage” a Trump “Golden Age,” he said, “with this self-inflicted feud.”
    


            Longtime Trump ally and personal friend Laura Ingraham exhorted Musk, whom she called a modern-day Thomas Edison, to see that “Trump is not the problem here.” She confessed the situation “makes me sad,” and solemnly claimed she “talked to an insider today who said it is irreparable.”
    


            Other Fox News personalities seemed to deny the severity of the two most powerful figures in conservative politics publicly calling each other liars, losers and worse.
    


            “Big deal,” Sean Hannity said. “They'll work it out eventually, they'll become friends again.”
    


            “There is no split,” declared “Fox & Friends” co-host Lawrence Jones on Friday morning. “They're going to bury the hatchet.” He added: “You've got two strong alpha males that are deep in their convictions and it just exploded online.”
    


            Primetime host Jesse Watters suggested Trump and Musk were “just blowing off steam” and likened the situation to buddies in a love triangle: “Guys sometimes will punch you in the face, and the next night you're having beer; sleep with your girlfriend, and you patch things up.”
    


            “Fox & Friends” co-host Ainsley Earhardt made a similar analogy: “It's just like a relationship,” she said. “Everyone's been in a relationship where in the very beginning you're crazy about each other, you're talking marriage, you're talking about meeting the family, and then all of a sudden it takes a turn and you don't like each other anymore.”

            Surprisingly, the network hasn't shied away from repeating Musk's allegation that Trump is mentioned in the so-called Epstein files, long a subject of right-wing conspiracy theories.
    


            “If Trump was in them, Biden probably would have released them,” Watters asserted. Trump “was one of the first people to realize just how horrible Epstein really was,” Hannity offered in a defense.
    


            “The Epstein file thing was way over the top, and just crazy to say Trump was in the Epstein files,” Brian Kilmeade said Friday morning. “﻿What are you doing?” However, Kilmeade was careful to praise Musk's efforts during his time in the Trump administration.
    


            Notably, none of Fox's MAGA-aligned opinion stars explicitly chose a side, instead choosing to believe this is a mere blip in their big, beautiful friendship. It will be interesting to see where they fall should things get even uglier. The safe bet's on Trump, of course.

            It's peak travel season, airports are packed and emotions are running high. You've probably seen it or even been part of it: that tense moment when a passenger snaps at a flight attendant, or a near-meltdown over a seat reclining too far. Why does flying seem to bring out the worst in us?
    


            Airplanes are, quite literally, a pressure cooker for emotions. For many, airports and airplanes are synonymous with anxiety, which often begins well before they step into the terminal.
    


            These environments combine stress, discomfort and a loss of control, often leaving even the calmest travelers feeling on edge.
    


            Planes also make inequalities bleedingly obvious. We've all experienced the envy of walking through first-class cabins to reach economy.
    


            It's easy to see why air rage has become so common. In fact, reported incidents have skyrocketed in recent years, exacerbated by pandemic-related anxieties.
    


            So, let's have a look at the science behind why we get so cranky when we fly. But more importantly, what we can do about it.
    


            In recent years, reports of unruly passenger behavior around the world have surged. Perhaps the most comprehensive indicator is the data compiled by the United States' Federal Aviation Administration, which shows a clear connection to the pandemic effect.
    


            In 2021, the administration recorded 5,973 incidents of unruly passenger behavior. This is a staggering 492% increase compared to the year before.
    


            To put this in perspective, the four-year average of such incidents for the period 2017–2020 was 901.75 (2017: 544, 2018: 889, 2019: 1,161, 2020: 1,009).
    


            While the numbers have decreased since their peak in 2021, they remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels.
    


            In 2022, the administration reported 2,455 incidents, followed by 2,076 in 2023, and 2,102 in 2024.
    


            These incidents in the US alone have led to 402 enforcement actions initiated in 2023, compared to a pre-pandemic high of 83 in a single year. Since 2021, fines totalling more than $21 million have been levied as a result of such incidents.
    


            The issue is not limited to the United States (although the US seems to have a higher share of such cases).
    


            The International Air Transport Association reported an increase in unruly passenger incidents globally, with one incident per 568 flights in 2022 — up from one per 835 flights in 2021.
    


            The most common types of incidents include non-compliance, verbally abusive behavior and intoxication. Notably, while non-compliance incidents initially fell after mask mandates were removed on most flights, the frequency began to rise again in 2022, ending the year 37% higher than in 2021.
    


            Examples of non-compliance include:

            Scholarly research has highlighted that the phenomenon arises from an interplay of stressors unique to aviation.
    


Environmental stressors



            Research consistently identifies the physical environment of airplanes as a significant contributor to passenger frustration and antisocial behavior.
    


            Factors such as cramped seating, limited personal space and high-density cabin configurations exacerbate discomfort and feelings of confinement.
    


            Psychological factors such as anxiety, claustrophobia and aviophobia (fear of flying) can also trigger an unusual behavior that the passenger may not show in other social contexts.
    


            In some studies, physical discomfort, such as encroachments into personal space, has been found the leading trigger for anger among passengers.
    


Emotional triggers such as frustration over delays, long lines at the security check or unmet service expectations, can escalate minor grievances into disruptive outbursts.
    


            Noise and hunger could further compound the situation. It can create a volatile atmosphere even before passengers acted out.
    


            Research has also suggested that low-cost carriers, while not directly responsible for air rage, create environments conducive to disruptive behavior due to reduced service levels, inadequate facilities and passenger stress from automation and cost-cutting measures.
    


Social stressors



            The role of inequality within the cabin environment is another potent factor.
    


            Research shows that airplanes serve as a microcosm of class-based society, with physical inequality (the presence of first-class cabins) and situational inequality (boarding through first-class sections) increasing the sense of frustration.
    


            Interestingly, situational inequality can even affect first-class passengers, by highlighting their privileges, sometimes fostering a sense of entitlement that may lead to antisocial behavior.
    


Alcohol use and nicotine withdrawal



            Alcohol is a dominant precipitant of air rage incidents. Some studies have found that more than half of reported air rage cases involved alcohol intoxication, often fuelled by liberal airport alcohol policies and in-flight consumption.
    


            Similarly, nicotine withdrawal was another factor, with nearly 9% of incidents attributed to smokers unable to satisfy their cravings during long flights.
    


Sociodemographic influences



            Empirical data suggest sociodemographic factors play a significant role in air rage incidents.
    


            One study examining 228 air rage cases found nearly 90% of incidents involved male passengers, with younger adults, particularly those aged 30–39, being the most frequently implicated.
    


            Cultural norms and expectations around air travel also influence behavior. They shape how passengers respond to delays, discomfort, breaches of etiquette or perceived inequities.

            In the UK, airlines and airport authorities have implemented measures, such as Edinburgh's “No Excuse for Abuse” campaign, to address the rise in disruptive behavior. Such initiatives remind passengers to treat staff and fellow travelers with respect, while emphasising a zero-tolerance approach to aggression.
    


            But tackling air rage requires more than just slogans.
    


            De-escalation techniques and early recognition of disruptive behavior can help diffuse situations before they escalate. Studies suggest experienced and well-trained crew members are better equipped to handle such incidents.
    


            There are also simple things you can do to improve the flying experience.
    


            Ultimately, it may be helpful to remember that air travel isn't always glamorous. Acknowledge that delays, discomfort and inconveniences are often part of the experience and accepting this reality can help reduce frustration.

            • Trump-Musk rift: President Donald Trump told CNN he's “not even thinking about” Elon Musk after they explosively sparred on social media, adding that he won't be speaking with Musk for “a while.” Yesterday, the president floated the idea of cutting the tech billionaire's government contracts, and Musk claimed Trump's name was in the Jeffrey Epstein files. Here's our blow-by-blow of the fight.



            • Agenda bill: The rift started with criticism of Trump's massive tax and domestic policy bill, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates would add $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. GOP leaders are hoping to send it to Trump's desk by July 4.
    


            • Trade talks: Meanwhile, White House adviser Peter Navarro said a trade meeting between the Trump administration and Chinese officials is expected to happen within seven days, following Trump's long-awaited call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping yesterday.
    


            Vice President JD Vance was with President Donald Trump when the feud with Elon Musk escalated yesterday, and Trump encouraged Vance to speak diplomatically about the situation with Musk publicly, according to a source familiar.
    


            The vice president and Trump spoke multiple times throughout the day yesterday, the source added.
    


            Vance posted a joke on social media about it being “a slow news day” ahead of a podcast interview with Theo Von, where he was presumably asked about the blowup. The interview has not yet aired.
    


            In one of Musk's reposts, the tech billionaire suggested that Trump be impeached and replaced with Vance.
    


            On his account, Vance posted last night: “President Trump has done more than any person in my lifetime to earn the trust of the movement he leads. I'm proud to stand beside him.” He did not mention Musk.
    


            President Donald Trump told CNN's Dana Bash that he won't bury the hatchet with tech billionaire Elon Musk any time soon.
    


Here's more of what he told her: 


In a phone call with CNN's Dana Bash, President Donald Trump said he is “not even thinking about” billionaire Elon Musk and won't be speaking to him in the near future. The comments come a day after Trump and Musk traded barbs on social media as their relationship deteriorated in spectacular public fashion. #cnn #news #trump #elon #musk


            President Donald Trump's administration urged the Supreme Court to allow officials to gut the Department of Education, a key priority for the president that has been stymied by a series of lower court decisions.
    


            The emergency appeal landed at the high court days after the Boston-based First US Circuit Court of Appeals declined to reverse a lower court order that halted mass firings at the department, which was signed into law during the Carter administration.
    


            Trump has filed more than a dozen emergency appeals at the Supreme Court since he returned to office in January.
    


            In its appeal to the Supreme Court, the administration argues its effort at the Education Department involves “internal management decisions” and “eliminating discretionary functions that, in the administration's view, are better left to the states.”
    


            Though Trump has repeatedly vowed to eliminate the department, the administration's lawyers told the Supreme Court in its filing today that “the government has been crystal clear in acknowledging that only Congress can eliminate the Department of Education.”
    


Remember: Trump ordered mass layoffs at the department earlier this year. The problem for the administration is that the department was created by Congress, and so lower courts have ruled it cannot be unilaterally unwound by the White House. At the same time, the administration does have the power to reduce the size of federal agencies, so long as they can continue to carry out their legal requirements.
    


            And that, the Department of Justice told the Supreme Court, is precisely what the administration is attempting to do.
    


            “The Department remains committed to implementing its statutorily mandated functions,” the Department of Justice told the Supreme Court in the appeal.
    


            Lawmakers, celebrities, analysts and others are reacting to President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk's public fallout.

            White House adviser Peter Navarro said a meeting on trade between Trump administration and Chinese officials is expected to happen within seven days.
    


            “There was a clear mandate between, an understanding between two presidents,” Navarro said today, referring to a 90-minute telephone call between President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping yesterday.
    


            After Trump's call with Xi, the US president said he was encouraged that ongoing trade tensions could soon be resolved. Trump deemed the conversation as “very good,” and said followup talks would occur “soon” between the countries' economic teams.
    


            Navarro told reporters at the White House that he, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Trade Representative Jamieson Greer or the president himself would announce when the meeting between US and Chinese officials was officially scheduled. Those four members of Trump's economic team are expected to participate in the upcoming talks as well.
    


            The US State Department issued guidance to its embassies and consulates worldwide on how to handle the Trump administration's new travel ban.
    


            The diplomatic cable, signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and seen by CNN, provides the first specific instructions for how consular officials should process visas of applicants from the barred countries.
    


            Some aspects — like what qualifies as a “national interest exception” — are not included, but the cable says details on that will be “forthcoming.”
    


            Prior to the to the proclamation going into effect on June 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET, diplomatic posts should continue to schedule visa applicants “from affected countries” and they “should continue normal visa processing, including approving eligible applicants, printing visas, and returning passports with issued visas,” the cable says.
    


            Even after the proclamation goes into effect, US diplomatic posts are instructed to continue to schedule appointments for applicants from affected countries. However, for applicants from the 19 barred countries, their visas will be refused unless they meet one of the exception criteria, it says.
    


            And if an applicant from a restricted country had been granted a visa before June 9 and has not yet received the visa, that visa will be canceled under the presidential proclamation unless the applicant can prove an exception.
    


            Exceptions for those from fully restricted countries include applicants who are dual nationals applying with a non-impacted country's passport, diplomats and government officials, employees of international organizations and NATO, and “national interest exceptions and certain athletes and athletic team members.”
    


            They also include “immediate family immigrant visas…with clear and convincing evidence of identity and family relationship” such as DNA or medical records.
    


            They make exceptions for adoptions, Afghan Special Immigrant Visas, Special Immigrant Visas for US government employees, “ethnic and religious minorities facing persecution in Iran,” and “approved national interest exceptions,” the cable states.
    


            Russia could offer political asylum to Elon Musk following the tech billionaire's public spat with President Donald Trump, a senior Russian lawmaker said in jest earlier today.
    


            “If he did (need asylum), of course, Russia could offer it,” Dmitry Novikov, first deputy chairman of Russia's State Duma on International Affairs, told state media TASS.
    


            Novikov stressed that Musk likely “will not need any political asylum,” but said Russia could provide it if necessary.
    


            Senior Russian official Dmitry Medvedev, former prime minister and president of Russia, joked that the Kremlin is prepared to help strike a “peace deal” between Musk and Trump.
    


            In a call with reporters earlier, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the dispute was an internal affair for the US and that the Kremlin is confident that Trump “will handle the situation himself.”
    


Putin and Stalin memes emerge: The Trump-Musk bust-up drew comparisons in Russia to the feud between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Yevgeny Prigozhin, the former leader of the Wagner mercenary group who mounted an abortive mutiny against Russia's leadership in the summer of 2023. In one meme, Musk's face replaced Prigozhin's, in a video when the military chief announced his march on Moscow.
    


            Another meme referenced a famous photograph of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, who was once photographed alongside secret police chief Nikola Yezhov. After the two men's falling out and Yezhov's execution, he was retouched out of the photo. After Trump and Musk's falling out, a meme showed how Musk had been “disappeared” from the photo.
    


            President Donald Trump today repeated his attack on the Federal Reserve and its leader, Jerome Powell, after fresh economic data reflected a resilient labor market.
    


            Trump in two posts on Truth Social blasted the US central bank for not lowering interest rates to his liking. In one post, he called the Fed “a disaster,” saying it is lagging behind the European Central Bank, which has lowered rates eight times.
    


            “Go for a full point, Rocket Fuel!” Trump wrote.
    


            In another post, Trump said the Fed ought to lower rates because “there is virtually no inflation (anymore).”
    


                    “He is costing our Country a fortune. Borrowing costs should be MUCH LOWER!!!” he said, referring to Powell.
                





            Fed officials in recent speeches have said they're inclined to hold borrowing costs steady for longer to get some additional clarity on Trump's polices and to see how the US economy ultimately responds to the administration's massive policy shifts.
    


            So far, the job market is holding steady, according to the Labor Department's latest batch of employment data showing solid hiring and low unemployment.
    


            A resilient labor market also allows the Fed to keep rates on hold, since it means officials have no need to deliver a rate cut to provide the economy with some support.
    


            The Fed has been on hold since January, after cutting rates three times last year. Investors don't expect a rate cut until October, according to futures.
    


            Tesla stock soared in the months after the presidential election because investors were convinced Donald Trump was about to do massive favors for his largest financial backer, CEO Elon Musk. But Trump can also do great damage to Musk's many business interests.
    


            The risk of that damage is one reason Tesla shares tumbled 14% in trading following their public spat yesterday.
    


            But it's not just Tesla that could be at risk. SpaceX depends on government contracts for a significant share of its revenue. And Musk's companies all face government regulation.
    


            Musk also faces possible investigations of his activities from agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    


            Trump appeared to threaten that he would take action against Musk.
    


                    “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!” he posted Thursday.
                





            Tesla has relatively few government contracts. But there are numerous federal policies that directly affect its finances, including a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle buyers that allows Tesla and other automakers to raise prices. That was likely worth billions to Tesla last year alone.
    


            Tesla also reported more than $8 billion in sales over six years of regulatory credits to other automakers to help them comply with federal and state emission standards. Trump wants to roll back those standards and strip states of the power to set their own emissions rules, which would destroy the market for those credit sales.

            President Donald Trump is planning to get rid of the Tesla he purchased in March, a senior White House official told CNN. The red vehicle may be sold or possibly given away, another official said.
    


            As of this morning, the Tesla was still visible parked in the West Executive Driveway, just one day after a very public and online feud erupted between Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
    


            Trump had previously allowed some of his younger staffers to use the car.
    


            “Taking President Trump's Tesla out for a ride with @PressSec,” Margo Martin posted on X in May, sharing a photo from inside the car alongside White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.
    


            Back in March, Trump transformed the South Lawn into what resembled a Tesla showroom, an apparent gesture toward Musk, his then-adviser. Later that day, Trump publicly announced he was purchasing a Tesla and had even bought a Cybertruck for his granddaughter.
    


            Just over half of Americans are worried that the Medicaid cuts in the House GOP's sweeping Trump agenda package would hurt their family's ability to obtain and afford health care, according to a poll released today by KFF, a nonpartisan health research group.
    


            Democrats and independents are much more likely to feel this way than Republicans and supporters of President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again movement, though nearly one-third of Republicans voiced concern about negative impacts on their families.
    


            The bill calls for instituting work requirements in Medicaid for the first time, checking enrollees' eligibility more often, penalizing certain states for providing coverage to undocumented immigrants using state funds and limiting states' ability to levy taxes on health care providers.
    


            About 70% of respondents in KFF's poll said they are concerned that the spending cuts would leave more people uninsured and would negatively affect hospitals, nursing homes and other providers in their communities. Among Republicans, 43% said they are worried that the legislation would negatively affect their local health care providers.
    


            The Congressional Budget Office estimates that nearly 11 million more people would be uninsured in 2034 under the bill.
    


            Just over a quarter of Medicaid enrollees identify as or lean Republican, including MAGA supporters, while just over a third identify as or lean Democrat and about the same share identify as or lean independent, the KFF poll found.
    


            The package is now in the Senate, which is expected to make changes to it. Several GOP senators have voiced concerns about the Medicaid measures' potential impact on their constituents and hospitals. More than 71 million Americans are enrolled in Medicaid, which provides health coverage to low-income people.
    


            Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro dismissed the president's public feud with tech billionaire Elon Musk as inconsequential, telling reporters that Musk was just “a special government employee with an expiration date.”
    


                    “People come and go from the White House,” Navarro said.
                





            Navarro downplayed the rift, suggesting Musk's criticisms on Trump's domestic policy agenda bill are unfounded and directly pushing back against concerns over the package, which has been cited as a flashpoint between the two.
    


            Musk, who was granted special government employee status to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, officially left the administration last week.
    


            The economic adviser also criticized Musk's longstanding opposition to tariffs, a centerpiece of Trump's trade policy.
    


            “Elon Musk does not like tariffs, full stop,” he said, adding that the tech mogul has “made that clear” since Trump's first term.
    


            “We can have disagreements about it, but I would simply say that everybody during our first term who said that the tariffs were going to be recessionary and inflationary were obviously, obviously and widely wrong,” he added.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed optimism that President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk's relationship could be salvaged despite yesterday's dramatic public blowup.
    


                    “Yeah, I believe in redemption, and I think it will all work out,” Johnson told CNN.
                





            Johnson said he had exchanged text messages with Musk but declined to reveal what was said.
    


            “We've been exchanging text messages, but you know I'm not going to get into the details of what we're discussing. He's a friend. Just trying to get everybody to yes,” he said.
    


            GOP leadership is working to move forward the president's agenda bill, which Musk slammed this week as a “disgusting abomination.”
    


            Johnson hit back at Musk's criticism of the bill in an interview with CNBC.
    


                    “I don't tell my friend Elon how to — I don't argue with him about how to build rockets,” Johnson said on CNBC. “And I wish he wouldn't argue with me about how to craft legislation and pass it.”
                





            After Musk denied Trump's claim that the Tesla CEO knew the inner workings of the bill yesterday, Johnson said that “everyone had plenty of time” to learn what was in it.
    


            When asked about Musk's comments that Trump would have lost the election without him, Johnson said: “Elon was a big contributor in the last election, but this was a whole team effort. I mean, President Trump is the most consequential political figure of his generation, of modern American history. He is the one responsible for that. But we all worked hard.”
    


This post has been updated with additional remarks from Johnson. 



            President Donald Trump told CNN this morning that he is “not even thinking about” billionaire Elon Musk and won't be speaking to him in the near future.
    


                    “I'm not even thinking about Elon. He's got a problem. The poor guy's got a problem,” Trump said.
                





            The comments come after a day in which Trump and Musk traded barbs on social media as their relationship publicly deteriorated.
    


            In a brief phone call, Trump talked about the forthcoming jobs report, inflation and gas prices.
    


            Asked if he had a call with Musk, he responded: “No. I won't be speaking to him for a while I guess, but I wish him well.”
    


            A federal judge has halted President Donald Trump's latest attempt to block international students from coming to Harvard University.
    


            The temporary restraining order issued late last night by US District Judge Allison Burroughs comes hours after the university urged the judge to step in on an emergency basis to block a proclamation Trump signed a day earlier that suspends international visas for new students at the nation's oldest and wealthiest university.
    


            Foreign students make up roughly a quarter of the school's student body.
    


            The brief order from Burroughs said if she didn't intervene now, the school would “sustain immediate and irreparable injury before there is an opportunity to hear from all parties” over the challenge to Trump's edict. The judge said her order “shall remain in effect until further order of this Court.”
    


            Burroughs set a hearing for mid-June to hear arguments over whether she should block Trump's proclamation indefinitely.
    


            Harvard's request to block Trump's ban amended an existing lawsuit over the administration's move to end Harvard's ability to enroll international students, which initially prompted the judge to stop the administration from revoking Harvard's student visa program.
    


            The amended lawsuit claimed Trump's proclamation violated the First Amendment by temporarily blocking the entry of nearly all new international Harvard students under visas most use to study at US universities or participate in academic exchange programs.
    


                    “Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” the amended complaint reads.
                





Read the full story.



            There is no call currently scheduled between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, according to a source.
    


            Some people close to Trump and Musk hope a call could put to rest their ongoing, explosive feud. There has been an effort on the part of some of those close to both men to arrange one, according to people familiar with the matter.
    


            Another source familiar offered no confirmation of a call, adding that the president's focus is on passing his agenda bill.
    


            As the two powerful onetime friends duked it out online yesterday, their shared allies sought to quietly broker a truce, CNN previously reported.
    


            Musk, for his part, appeared open to a thaw:
    


                    “You're not wrong,” Musk responded to a post from billionaire investor Bill Ackman, who wrote on X: “I support @realDonaldTrump and @elonmuskand they should make peace for the benefit of our great country. We are much stronger together than apart.”
                





            Allies caught in the middle of the implosion between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk were delicately attempting to broker peace between the two men on Thursday when their quiet conversations were disrupted by a post on X.
    


                    “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” Musk wrote, stunning those with close relationships to Trump and Musk.
                





            Musk has not detailed how he would have gained access to unreleased files related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and has not provided any evidence of where his information was coming from.
    


            Several people familiar with what was happening behind the scenes — who were desperately making phone calls to one another and trying to tamp down the escalating feud — described that as the tipping point, fearing that there was no going back after Musk's loaded accusation about the president regarding the so-called Epstein files.
    


            While Trump and Musk had largely argued over policy, it had now turned personal.
    


            Officials in the West Wing spent most of Thursday glued to their phones as they watched the battle between the two play out on X and Truth Social. Several aides were sending the updates in group chats, likening it to a divorce and commenting that they expected this would happen, just not this soon.
    


            “I thought maybe August,” one noted to CNN.
    


Read the full story.



            A public feud exploded yesterday between President Donald Trump and his one-time ally, the tech billionaire Elon Musk.
    


            It began during a media event at the White House where Trump said he was “very disappointed” in the tech billionaire after Musk repeatedly blasted the president's sweeping domestic agenda bill in recent days.
    


            “Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore,” Trump told reporters, less than one week after the two exchanged effusive praise on Musk's last day in the administration in which he was granted special government employee status to lead the Department of Government Efficiency.

            Any reasonable American could objectively ask what exactly President Donald Trump's new travel ban, which affects a dozen countries, is about.
    


            Is it about protecting Americans from “murderers,” as Trump said Thursday, or punishing small countries for a modest number of students who overstayed their visas?
    


            The drive for Trump's first-term travel ban in 2017 and 2018 was clear.
    


            He was seeking to deliver on an ugly campaign promise to ban all Muslims from entering the US. That morphed, over the course of years as the administration adapted to court cases, into a ban on travel to the US by people from certain countries, most of which were majority-Muslim.
    


            It was only by agreeing to ignore Trump's anti-Muslim 2016 campaign statements and focus solely on the security-related language in his third attempt at a travel ban that the US Supreme Court ultimately gave its blessing to that ban.



            “… We must consider not only the statements of a particular President, but also the authority of the Presidency itself,” wrote Chief Justice John Roberts in the majority opinion.
    


            Trump is using that authority again in his second term.
    


            But this time, as he said Thursday in the Oval Office, the ban is about removing “horrendous” people who are in the country now and about keeping murderers out.
    


            The data suggest the travel ban will primarily affect students and businesspeople from countries in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean as well as the Middle East.
    


            It was an attack on Jewish community members in Colorado by an Egyptian national that convinced Trump to speed up plans to ban people from a dozen countries from entering the US, restarting the travel ban policy he pioneered during his first term.
    


            But Egypt is not on the travel ban list.
    


            Neither is Kuwait, the country where Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder attack, lived before coming to the US.
    


            “Egypt has been a country we deal with very closely. They have things under control,” Trump told reporters Thursday.
    


            Instead, the travel ban includes countries that Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who assembled the list, feel don't have things under control.
    


            That includes places like Equatorial Guinea in Africa and Burma, also known as Myanmar, in Asia. Neither is a nexus of terror threatening the American homeland.
    


            Trump's order announcing the travel ban explains that these countries have high rates of students and other travelers overstaying their visas in the US.
    


            It points to a report of DHS “overstay” data from 2023 to argue that for more than 70% of people from Equatorial Guinea with US student visas, there is no record of them leaving the US when their visa ended.
    


            In real numbers, that equals 233 people with student visas. The numbers are similarly small for other African countries.
    


            “They're just throwing things at the wall,” said David Bier, an immigration expert at the libertarian-leaning Cato institute and a Trump immigration policy critic.
    


            “There's not really a coherent philosophy behind any of this,” Bier added.
    


            The reinstated travel ban does include countries associated with terrorism, including Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, all of which were also included in Trump's first-term travel ban. But it's worth noting that no immigrant or traveler from one of these countries has launched a terror attack on the US in recent years, according to a review by the Washington Post during Trump's first term. A man from Sudan killed one person at a Tennessee church in 2017.
    


            “The president claims that there is no way to vet these nationals, yet that is exactly what his consular officers and border officials have successfully done for decades,” Bier said.
    


            The man responsible for the ISIS-inspired truck bomb in New Orleans in January, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, was a Texas-born Army veteran and US citizen.
    


            The new travel ban also includes Afghanistan, which could jeopardize many Afghans related to those who aided the US during its war there, as Shawn VanDiver, president of the aid organization #AfghanEvac, told CNN's Jim Sciutto on Thursday.
    


            “There are 12,000 people who have been separated through the actions of our government, who have been waiting for more than three and a half years,” he said.
    


            The Trump administration recently paused the processing of student visas, interrupting the plans of thousands of people to study in the US.
    


            In the Oval Office, Trump said he was not interested in banning students from China.
    


            “It's our honor to have them, frankly, we want to have foreign students, but we want them to be checked,” Trump said, suggesting there will be even more strenuous background checks in the future.
    


            The existence of the travel ban list could also factor into tariff negotiations the Trump administration has taken on with nations across the world, as well as its effort to countries nations to take back migrants it wants to deport.
    


            “It's about power and control and manipulating both the US population to suppress dissent as well as trying to manipulate foreign relations with these countries by getting them to do whatever he wants in order to get off the disfavored nation list,” Bier said.

“Captain America doesn't wear a beard and a turban, and he's white.”

Vishavjit Singh looked at the boy who uttered those words, and then he looked at himself — a skinny, bespectacled, turbaned, bearded Sikh in a Captain America suit.

“I wasn't offended, because I knew that this kid was going to have this image of me, a Sikh Captain America, forever in his mind,” Singh said. “This image has so much power to it that it opens up conversations about what it means to be American.”

Representation of non-Abrahamic religions and spiritual traditions, particularly in the mainstream comics universe, is minimal. Even when they are portrayed in comics, their presentation, as Singh and others in the field point out, is often inauthentic and sometimes negative.

Recently, however, comic book writers and academics who study the intersection of religion and comics observe a renaissance of sorts, which they say is happening because people close to these faith traditions are telling these stories with a reverence and sincerity that resonate with a wider audience.




Singh's journey to make that connection began after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, triggered anti-Sikh hate incidents. Having faced hate and exclusion throughout his life, he decided to spread his message of kindness and inclusion by capitalizing on the appeal of comics and superheroes — an area where he found Sikh representation to be “virtually zero.”

He suited up as Captain Sikh America in Manhattan for the first time in summer 2013 — one year after a self-proclaimed white supremacist opened fire inside a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, killing six and injuring four others. 

New York's reaction to Captain Sikh America was joyous.

“Strangers came up and hugged me,” Singh said. “Police officers wanted photos with me. A couple wanted me to be part of their wedding ceremony. I felt I had a certain privilege I'd never had before.”

In 2016, Singh gave up his full-time job to travel around the country to schools, government agencies and corporations to share his story and educate youth about his culture and faith. He doesn't speak directly about religion but rather the core values of Sikhism.

“I talk about equality, justice and about the universal light being present in every speck of creation,” he said.

Marvel's Black Panther heralded better representation for Africana religions in the U.S., according to Yvonne Chireau, a professor of religion at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. However what is seen in Black Panther or other comics is a synthesis of different African religions and cultural practices, she said.

For example, one page might talk about the Orishas, divine spirits that play a key role in the Yoruba faith of West Africa, while another might feature Egyptian gods. One of the first superheroes with African religious roots, Chireau said, was Brother Voodoo, created in the 1970s by Marvel publisher Stan Lee, writer Len Wein and artist John Romita. He was the first Haitian superhero.

The turn of the last century was a time of revival for Black-centric comics, she said, adding that immigration from African and Caribbean countries, including Haiti, led to increased understanding of religious practices originating in those places.

“It's definitely gotten a lot better and much more authentic because the people who are telling these stories care about those religious practices,” she said.

Brooklyn-born Haitian American comic book writer Greg Anderson Elysée said he didn't learn about African and Caribbean religious traditions until he was a teenager. Elysée was raised Catholic, but he now considers himself agnostic. For the past decade, he's written comics about Is'nana, the son of Anansi the Spider, the god of wisdom, knowledge and mischief in the Akan religion of West Africa.

What drives his vision and his creativity, Elysée said, is the need to see more Black mythology, deities and spirituality showcased with the same level of respect as European fairy tales and Greek mythology.

“When I went looking for anything on African spirituality in the bookstore, I found it in the occult section as opposed to the religion or mythology section,” he said. Common depictions of African faith as voodoo and witchcraft are colonialist narratives aimed at demonizing Indigenous spiritual practices, he added.

“When I started going to ceremonies and rituals, I saw how much power there is in it. When we know who we are — whether you believe in the religion or not — it fills you with joy, a purpose and a sense of being.”

Elysée is excited and relieved by the reaction to his work.

“While this is entertainment, you also don't want to offend those who believe in it and truly get so much power from it,” he said. “Some of my portrayals of these religions in my comics may not be 100% authentic, but there is a level of research and respect that goes into every piece of it.”

Zen Buddhism has informed much of John Porcellino's work. For over three decades, he has produced and self-published King-Cat Comics and Stories, a largely autobiographical mini-comic series. Porcellino was drawn to Buddhism in his 20s after what he describes as a period of intense mental suffering and health problems.

As a punk rock fan, Porcellino saw commonalities between punk and Zen because “they are both concerned with the essence of things rather than appearances.” Both are ways of life — simple yet nuanced. 

He gave the example of a wordless story titled “October,” featured in King-Cat's 30th issue, that shows him as a high school student walking home one night from school. When he gets home, his mom asks him to take the dog outside; as he steps out, he sees the stars.

“It's the experience of being in everyday, mundane life ... and then suddenly breaking through to some kind of transcendence,” he said.

Porcellino views these comics as a healing presence in his life.

“They are an important part of my spiritual practice,” he said. “Any time I have a major crisis in my life, my first reaction is to sit down and start making comics and put my focus into that. It just helps ground me.”

Teresa Robeson, who wrote a graphic novel about the 14th Dalai Lama, said that even though her mother was Catholic and raised her in the faith, her grandmother was Buddhist. She grew up in Hong Kong, with memories of relatives praying to Buddhist gods, taking in the fragrance of burning incense and the sound of Buddhist chants.

Though she practices neither Catholicism nor Buddhism at this time, Robeson jumped at the opportunity to tell the story of the Dalai Lama in graphic novel form because the book focused on a pivotal moment in the spiritual leader's life, when he fled Tibet for India after the Chinese occupation.

Robeson liked the idea of representing a religion and culture that do not get much attention in media.

“Children's books are like mirrors and windows for kids,” she said. “It's helpful especially for children of immigrants who don't often see themselves in mainstream literature. They don't see anyone who looks like them or prays like them. At the same time, it also helps kids who are not Asian or Buddhist to learn something about those communities.” 

Amar Chitra Katha was a comic book company started by the late Anant Pai in Mumbai in 1967 as a way to teach Indian children about their own mythology and culture. The first title was “Krishna,” an important god in Hinduism and protagonist of the Bhagavad Gita, one of the religion's main sacred texts.

Pai was an engineer turned comic books seller who used varied marketing techniques, including walking around with planks, nails and hammers in his bag so he could build shelves for bookstores that refused to display his comics because they lacked shelf space, said Reena I. Puri, the company's managing director and a 35-year veteran of the business.

Pai started with Hindu mythology and gods but soon expanded to other faiths, releasing a globally successful comic titled “Jesus Christ” and others about Buddha, Sikh gurus and Mahavira, who founded Jainism. Later came secular comics about historical figures and folktales. 

But religion remains the mainstay of Amar Chitra Katha, and books that teach children about faith, history and culture are also the most popular in the diaspora, Puri said. 

“Most recently we've also portrayed (Indigenous) religions and have gathered folktales relating to these traditions from all over India,” she said.

Amar Chitra Katha comics faced criticism in the past for their portrayal of gods as fair-skinned and “asuras” — often the antagonists to the gods — as dark-skinned with demonic facial features. But that has changed, Puri said.

“We've educated ourselves and realized that our ancient texts were not as racist or colorist as we may be today,” she said. “We're correcting those misconceptions now.”

British comic book writer Mike Carey is known for his 2000-2006 DC Comics series “Lucifer,” which depicts the titular character's adventures on Earth, in Heaven and in various realms after abandoning Hell. Carey counts himself an atheist who went to Sunday school only “for the fun, stories and chocolate.”

Carey portrayed Lucifer as the “son of God, but as a rebellious disobedient son who wants to find himself as distinct from his father.” 

He has also explored pagan themes, particularly what he called the “weird interface between British folklore and British religious traditions.” 

Carey delved into the concepts of faith, God and morality in a series titled “My Faith in Frankie,” which tells the story of a teenager with a personal god called Jeriven who gets jealous of her boyfriend.

Even though many of his comics and novels explore religion and ethics, Carey said, he has never “felt any temptation whatsoever to believe.”

“I've become more and more entrenched in that position, because organized religions are like any organization that sustain themselves, amass power, wealth and authority,” he said. “So I've never really grappled with religious issues. What I do sometimes is explore, play with and tease out moral issues that were important and meaningful to me.”

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — There is an unmistakable air of Peckham these days in Bosnia's capital, Sarajevo, as the legendary yellow three-wheeled van from the BBC's long-running sitcom “Only Fools and Horses” cruises the city streets.

The little Reliant Regal was the trademark of the stars of the series — the irresistible Trotter brothers from Peckham, a working-class neighborhood in London. In Bosnia, a replica belongs to the Fatic brothers, local businessmen who are crazy about the show.

The Fatics are dealers in home appliances, running a successful company with dozens of employees and a huge shop on the outskirts of Sarajevo. Building the business, however, has resembled the ups and downs of the Peckham market traders Del Boy and Rodney Trotter, they say.

“We are definitely the local version of the series,” Tarik Fatic, the younger of the brothers, told The Associated Press. “We were always dealing in something, we would buy whatever we can and then sell it.”

The enormously popular BBC sitcom, which began in 1981, follows the lives of the Trotter brothers and their far-from-straightforward path from rags to riches. Over the course of seven series and several Christmas specials, the Trotters tried various get-rich-quick schemes, buying low-quality or sometimes black-market goods and selling them at the market. 




Many in Bosnia and in the wider Balkans easily identify with the Trotters' endless wheeling and dealing. In the region that went through a series of wars in the 1990s, where the economy was shattered and remains deeply corrupt, the Trotter ways of survival are simple reality.

Just like the Trotter brothers, “we always tried to make profit and regardless of how many times we failed, we just moved on,” Tarik Fatic said.

Also from a working-class family, and growing up in a country that was devastated in the bloody 1992-95 ethnic conflict, the brothers tried trading in food, poultry and clothes before settling on home appliances. They are aware there are no guarantees their current success will last. 

“The market (in Bosnia) is still disorganized and unstable,” Tarik Fatic, 33, said. “Not a day passes without the two (Del Boy and Rodney) crossing my mind.” 

Known here as Mucke, which actually means something like wheeling and dealing, “Only Fools and Horses” became hugely popular throughout what was still Yugoslavia from the 1980s onwards. 

Murals with images of main characters have been painted on the walls; many cafes were named after the series, while visiting actors were greeted with frenzy. 

The Reliant Regal was made by a British company, famous for its eccentric vehicles, that went out of business in 2002. 

In Sarajevo, people wave, take pictures with their phones, honk their horns when they see the yellow van in the streets. The Fatic brothers imported it from Manchester six months ago after a long search. It took a while to register the unusual vehicle, said Mirnes Fatic, 38.

“It is a very nice feeling. It's a joy every time I go for a ride in the city,” he said, admitting that it also was “a great advertising move.”

And it's not just the van. The Fatic brothers have also named their company after the series — Only Fools and Horses Brothers Mucke. There have been some doubts how clients and banks would react but it turned out really well, Mirnes added.

“We hope and believe that this time next year, we will be millionaires,” he smiled, using the famous phrase from the show.

HONG KONG (AP) — Prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong on Friday was charged with conspiracy to collude with foreign forces to endanger national security under a Beijing-imposed law that critics say has crushed Hong Kong's once-thriving pro-democracy movement.

The prosecution was the second time Wong has been charged under the sweeping national security law. He was already convicted in a separate subversion case linked to an unofficial primary election and was sentenced last year to four years and eight months in jail for that charge. 

The prosecution accused Wong, 28, of conspiring with fellow activist Nathan Law and others to ask foreign countries, institutions, organizations or individuals outside of China to impose sanctions or blockades, or engage in other hostile actions, against Hong Kong and China. 

They also said he disrupted the formulation and implementation of laws and policies by the Chinese and Hong Kong governments, and that the act was likely to have serious consequences. The alleged offenses occurred between July 2020 and November 2020.

The prosecution didn't elaborate on the accusations in court. The charge carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

After hearing the charge in court, Wong, who wore a blue shirt and was visibly thinner, said he “understood” the charge.

The case was adjourned to August.

National security police arrested Wong in Stanley prison on Friday on the new national security charge and also on suspicion of “dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offense,” police said in a statement. 




Wong rose to prominence in Hong Kong in 2012 as a high school student leading protests against the introduction of national education in the city's schools. Two years later, he became world famous as a leader of the Occupy Movement.

In 2016, Wong co-founded a political party named Demosisto with fellow young activists Law and Agnes Chow. In the 2019 pro-democracy movement, Wong helped seek overseas support for the protests. His activism led Beijing to label him an advocate of Hong Kong's independence who “begged for interference” by foreign forces.

Demosisto disbanded when Beijing imposed the security law in 2020. The Chinese and Hong Kong governments said the law brought back stability to the city. 

In 2023, Hong Kong authorities offered rewards of 1 million Hong Kong dollars ($127,600) for information leading to the arrests of Law, who moved to Britain, and several other overseas-based activists. 

Amnesty International's China Director Sarah Brooks said in a statement that the new prosecution against Wong showed the security law's “capacity to be used by Hong Kong authorities to threaten human rights in the city is as potent and present as ever.”

“This latest charge against him underscores the authorities' fear of prominent dissidents and shows the lengths they will go to keep them behind bars for as long as possible -- in so doing, continuing a chilling effect on civic activism in the city,” she said, urging the government to drop the charge and cease enforcing the law.

London, ENGLAND (AP) — David Beckham, the former England soccer captain who has been an ambassador for the U.N. children's fund for two decades, is to receive a knighthood in next week's honors list from King Charles III, according to U.K. media reports Friday.

Without citing sources, the BBC said Beckham is set to receive further recognition both for his soccer career, and his contributions to British society.

Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy breaks down the growing rift between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk as the two trade public jabs, including threats to cut government contracts.

FIRST ON FOX: The chairman of the House Budget Committee is pushing back on Elon Musk's claim that President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" is full of ""pork.""

Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, told Fox News Digital it was not possible for ""pork barrel spending"" to be included in the legislation, called a budget reconciliation bill, because the reconciliation process was simply not the mechanism for such federal funds.

""Reconciliation does not have anything to do with discretionary spending - earmarks, and all of that,"" Arrington said. ""And quite frankly, the [Department of Government Efficiency] findings were, I think, almost entirely an issue for . . . annual appropriations.""

""Discretionary spending"" refers to the annual dollars allocated by Congress each year through the appropriations process – also known as ""spending bills.""

It's a process that's historically known to be rife with ""pork barrel spending"" from both Republicans and Democrats – funding for pet projects or other specific initiatives benefiting a certain member of Congress' district.

But reconciliation deals with the government's ""mandatory spending"" – largely government welfare programs that can only be amended by changing the law.

""We're dealing with mandatory spending programs – entitlements, health care, welfare and the tax code,"" Arrington said. 

""We did a responsible bill. There's no pork in it. The question, I think, for some folks and the objective of mine and my budget committee members was, whatever we're doing on tax or security to unleash growth and to buy greater security for the American people, we wanted it to be done in a fiscally responsible way.""

Senior White House adviser Stephen Miller echoed that sentiment on X: ""The reconciliation bill cuts taxes, seals the border and reforms welfare. It is not a spending bill. There is no ‘pork.' It is the campaign agenda codified.""

The vast majority of the trillions of dollars in the bill are aimed at Trump's tax policies – extending his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) while implementing new priorities like eliminating taxes on tips and overtime wages.

There's also $4 trillion in House Republicans' versions of the bill aimed at raising the debt limit.

The legislation is also aimed at amending current laws to enable new funding for border security and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) – projected to boost those priorities by billions of dollars.

To offset those costs, House GOP leaders are seeking stricter work requirements for Medicaid and food stamps, while shifting more of the cost burden for both programs to the states.

Republicans are also looking to roll back green energy tax subsidies in former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

But Musk and other fiscal hawks' main concern has been that the legislation does not go far enough with those spending cuts.

They've also raised concerns about the overall bill adding to the national debt – which is currently nearing $37 trillion.

As part of his social media campaign against the bill, Musk called for both eliminating the tax cuts and removing the debt limit increase from the final legislation.

Musk reposted another X user who wrote, ""Drop the tax cuts, cut some pork, get the bill through.""

He's also shown support on X for Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and his call to strip the debt limit provision out of the bill.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has projected that the bill would cut taxes by $3.7 trillion while raising deficits by $2.4 trillion over a decade.

House Foreign Affairs Committee member Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., breaks down USAID's wasteful spending on 'America Reports.'

Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, said a thorough review of spending from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is warranted, following the Trump administration's efforts to overhaul the agency.  

USAID was an independent agency to provide impoverished countries aid and offer development assistance, but the agency was upended since February when President Donald Trump installed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to oversee the organization amid concerns that USAID did not advance U.S. core interests. Since then, the agency has faced layoffs and is being absorbed into the State Department. 

This increased scrutiny on USAID spending is valid, according to Risch. 

""The amount of money that we're spending on that has to be reviewed top to bottom,"" Risch said during an event Wednesday at the Washington-based think tank the Hudson Institute.

Risch said that several weeks into the Trump administration, he and others, including Rubio, evaluated a list of programs that detailed $3 million in funding for ""promotion of democracy in Lower Slobovia."" According to Risch, the description didn't provide enough information and items like these are totaling up to billions of dollars that must undergo review.

""Lower Slobovia"" is a fictional place and a term used by Americans to describe an underdeveloped foreign country.""We can do so much better, not only in how, how much money we spend, but how we spend it,"" Risch said. ""So, if you say, well, we're eliminating this program, be careful you don't say, 'Oh, that means we're walking away from human rights.' Look, America is human rights. If America leads the way on human rights. We are the world standard on human rights. We have no intention of giving that position up.""

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) targeted USAID in its push to eliminate wasteful spending. The agency came under fire for many funding choices, including allocating $1.5 million for a program that sought to ""advance diversity, equity and inclusion in Serbia's workplaces and business communities"" and a $70,000 program for a ""DEI musical"" in Ireland.

‘HYSTERIA': WHITE HOUSE SHUTS DOWN CONCERNS OVER USAID DOCUMENT PURGE

United States Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and James Risch, R-Idaho, attend the Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing for Marco Rubio to be Secretary of State on January 15, 2025.  

As a result, Rubio announced on March 11 that the State Department completed a six-week review and would cancel more than 80% of USAID programs — cutting roughly 5,200 of USAID's 6,200 programs.

Fox News Digital was the first to report later in March that the State Department planned to absorb the remaining operations and programs USAID runs so it would no longer function as an independent agency. 

The move means eliminating thousands of staff members in an attempt to enhance the existing, ""life-saving"" foreign assistance programs, according to a State Department memo that Fox News Digital obtained.

Sen. Jim Risch said the increased scrutiny evaluating USAID funding is warranted.  (Alex Brandon-Pool/Getty Images)

""Foreign assistance done right can advance our national interests, protect our borders, and strengthen our partnerships with key allies,"" Rubio said in a March statement to Fox News Digital. ""Unfortunately, USAID strayed from its original mission long ago. As a result, the gains were too few and the costs were too high.""

""We are reorienting our foreign assistance programs to align directly with what is best for the United States and our citizens,"" Rubio said. ""We are continuing essential lifesaving programs and making strategic investments that strengthen our partners and our own country.""

Meanwhile, Democrats slammed the restructuring of the agency, labeling the move ""illegal."" 

""Donald Trump and Elon Musk's destruction and dismantling of USAID is not only disastrous foreign policy and counter to our national security interests; it is plainly illegal,"" the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., said in a statement in March. ""Congress wrote a law establishing USAID as an independent agency with its own appropriation, and only Congress can eliminate it.""

Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., discusses Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoing a bill that would have prevented China from buying land next to military bases on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Mexican drug cartels are getting help from the Chinese to build their drug empire that feeds off American consumers. 

Border patrol officials intercepted 50,000 kilos of precursor chemicals this week used in the process of manufacturing methamphetamines, sent from China and intended for members of the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico. In addition to providing the cartels with the chemicals needed to make illicit drugs, Chinese entities are also one of the foremost actors in helping them launder their proceeds, according to the Treasury Department.

""For far too long, the Mexican drug cartels have raked in billions of dollars at the expense of our local communities leaving nothing but addiction, death and despair in their wake,"" said Chad Plantz, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent in Charge in Houston. ""This initiative provides HSI with a game-changing method to stay one step ahead of the cartels by disrupting the flow of chemicals that they depend on to produce illicit narcotics.""

The seizure was part of an ongoing initiative launched in 2019 to identify suspicious shipments of precursor chemicals from China, India and other countries that are destined for Mexican drug cartels. Since the initiative was established, officials have interdicted more than 1,700,000 kilograms of chemicals used to manufacture methamphetamines and fentanyl, including a seizure this past March of 44,000 kilograms of precursor chemicals at the Port of Houston, destined for the Sinaloa Cartel.

Immigration officials' bust comes amid news of a spate of other incidents involving Chinese nationals or individuals working for China who have engaged in espionage efforts, ranging from agroterroism and selling military secrets, to infiltrating U.S. universities and utilizing American-based products to sow political divisions online.

In the latest incident, two Chinese nationals were charged with allegedly smuggling a ""dangerous biological pathogen"" into the U.S. to study at a University of Michigan laboratory. This happened amid controversy over the Trump administration's effort to intensify visa scrutiny for Chinese nationals trying to enter the United States.

CHINESE OFFICIAL REPORTEDLY SEEKING TALKS WITH TRUMP ON FENTANYL INGREDIENTS AMID TRADE WAR

Last month, an expansive investigation by a group of Stanford students detailed how there is a culture of students and faculty at their school doing work for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The report highlighted how some students want to work with the Chinese government, such as through sharing intellectual property or aligning their research priorities with Chinese interests, while others are sometimes coerced into doing work for the CCP, particularly if they have family back in Beijing.

Meanwhile, just this week, reports of Chinese efforts to steal U.S. state secrets or sow political divisions have surfaced. 

On Friday, the Department of Justice indicted two Chinese nationals and a lawful permanent resident for conspiring to traffic sensitive American military technology to the CCP. 

Over the weekend, a British businessman was arrested for attempting to smuggle sensitive U.S. military components to China. 

American artifical intelligence company OpenAI this week also shutdown a Chinese-linked influence operation that was utilizing its ChatGPT product to generate social media posts and sow political division related to U.S. politics online.

The American Airlines flight that caught fire soon after taking off from Denver International Airport in March had several parts installed incorrectly and fuel leaks, according to a preliminary report released Thursday. 

The Dallas-bound aircraft had one loose part inside the right engine installed in the wrong direction and fuel leaking from the fitting of another part that was also fastened incorrectly, according to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report.

Soon after the plane took off, the crew noticed issues with the right engine, the report said.

""The captain noted high engine vibration indications for the right engine,"" the report stated, while the crew discussed whether they needed to divert before contacting American Airlines dispatchers. 

They landed safely, but soon after arriving at a gate, passengers and crew members noticed fire and smoke filling the cabin. Images and video showed passengers evacuating the aircraft and standing on the wings of the plane.

""One of the flight attendants tried calling the flight crew"" while another ""knocked on the cockpit door to alert the flight crew,"" the report said.

The NTSB report also showed streaks on the outside of the engine from the leaking fuel. The plane was towed to a hangar for examination.

During an inspection of the damage, investigators saw that the plane ""exhibited heat/smoke/burn indications near the right engine nacelle, right wing, right side of the fuselage aft of the wing, the right main landing gear, and the right main landing gear wheel well,"" the report said. 

In addition, ""the lockwire of a fuel fitting on the variable stator vane (VSV)"" was loose and installed in the incorrect direction, in addition to other issues. 

Further examination of the engines found that one fan blade platform was fractured, according to the report.

Another part of the plane that controls airflow through the turbine's compressor was found to be ""incorrectly fastened and secured … allowing fuel to leak from the fitting.""

American Airlines said 172 passengers and six crew members were on board at the time of the incident. 

The airplane had ""substantial damage"" while 12 passengers and the six crew members sustained minor injuries, according to the report.

A Seattle man died after falling 3,000 feet from a climbing route at Denali National Park in Alaska, the National Park Service said Wednesday.

Alex Chiu, 41, was ascending the West Buttress route of Mount McKinley on Monday, June 2, one of the park's most frequently climbed routes, while not attached to a rope, the agency said in a statement. 

He was ski mountaineering, which involves ascending and descending the route with skis. He was joined by two others in his expedition to conquer North America's highest peak.

Two others witnessed his fall onto the rocky face covered in jagged ice, and lowered themselves over the edge as far as they could, but they could not see or hear him after the fall, officials said.

The mountaineers descended the route to ask for assistance at Camp 1, which is located around 7,800 feet up the mountain. 

Due to high winds and snow, ground and air search teams were unable to quickly reach the area where he had fallen on Monday. On Wednesday, clear weather allowed two rangers to depart Talkeetna, a village south of the mountain, in a helicopter search for Chiu.

When his body was found, it was transferred to the state medical examiner, the agency said. Fox News Digital has reached out to the Alaska State Medical Examiner's Office for Chiu's official cause of death.

Chiu was an aerospace engineer at the Federal Aviation Administration and, before that, a software engineer at Boeing, according to his LinkedIn profile. On his social media accounts, he described himself as a storyteller, traveler, scuba diver, rock climber, alpinist and marathon runner.

He wrote on his Instagram account about how living in Seattle allowed him to take his ice-climbing tools to the mountains every weekend. He shared that following the daily grind of his 9-to-5, he would pack up his gear and head to the mountains.

""I had become so good at what I did that I started teaching others how to do it, and that was even more fun to teach others how to experience the joy you have in these wild places,"" he wrote in an Instagram post. ""When I am in the mountains, I realize I was at my best. I was smart, witty, passionate, and bold.""

The pandemic put the brakes on his alpine climbs, but he dreamed of heading back to the climb.

""So tomorrow I am getting on an airplane to Alaska,"" he wrote in an Instagram post on May 19, ""in an attempt to climb the third-highest peak in the world because I don't want to know what happens to a dream deferred.""

The busiest season on the mountain lasts from mid-May to mid-June; there were about 500 climbers on it Wednesday, the agency said. Chiu is one of several people who have died while climbing Mount McKinley or other areas of Denali National Park.

Just a few moments after Air Force One took off from Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, President Donald Trump sat at his desk aboard the plane with a handful of his trusted staff members, including White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

All of them smiled as Air Force One settled itself after takeoff. The president was heading to one of his favorite parts of the country to mark a deal between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel that few outside of some very determined western Pennsylvania local union steelworkers thought would ever come to fruition.

Trump left the intrigue of Washington and pressures of his position to head toward a hero's welcome at the Irvin Works plant in West Mifflin. He admitted he hadn't wrapped his mind around the crowd's outpouring of gratitude.

On the screen facing Trump was the Will Cain Show on Fox News, which panned to the crowd at the Irvin Works plant. The scene was a sea of orange safety jackets and hard hats, all standing in the building that the workers there call Highway One, on the other side of the rolling mill. The crowd was filled with men and women whose daily jobs leave them with dirt under their nails and pride in their chests because of their impact on everyone's lives.

Trump stared for the briefest of moments at the scene. He smiled and then drew Bessent's attention to the screen. Trump is used to an enthusiastic crowd, but this was different: These men and women went against their union to support this deal.

“Look at that, Scott,” Trump said.

One of Trump's staff members informed him that organizers at the rally had just told the union steelworkers, community leaders, and their family members waiting for the president about the terms of the deal. This includes $14 billion in capital investment projects at U.S. Steel, and the only remaining blast furnace mill in Pittsburgh will get $2.2 billion. It is an investment that will protect 11,400 existing jobs and create and support 14,000 new ones, including over 10,200 in construction.

It also guarantees that the majority of U.S. Steel's board will be U.S. citizens, and key management members, including the CEO, will also be U.S. citizens. Only U.S. citizens will have direction over trade actions, with oversight from the federal government.

It was a deal Trump said he didn't want to happen initially.

The morning started at 4 a.m. in western Pennsylvania after the alarm went off. By noon, I was at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. 

Interviews rarely make me nervous. To me, they should be more of a conversation. The readers get more from that back-and-forth, whether it is with a president, farmer, or hairdresser. It isn't everyone's style, but it suits me.

What does make me nervous is logistics — getting to places not just on time but with time to spare. My Google Maps app made it tricky that day by flunking out, which meant I had to rely on my best skill set: a decent sense of directions combined with a 7-year-old Rand McNally map and sheer determination. I only got somewhat turned around when I drove around Andrews's vast campus.

I have interviewed Trump at least two dozen times over the years, in Erie, Johnstown, Wilkes-Barre, Pittsburgh, and Harrisburg. I have also interviewed him at the White House in the West Wing.

These interviews were all unique. But this interview, along with the one we were initially supposed to do on July 13, 2024, in Butler, will be in the history books someday, not because of me, but because of what happened on both days.

In Butler, we were set to do the interview five minutes before the rally, which then changed to five minutes after the rally. That changed to an interview on Trump Force One on the flight back to Bedminster from Butler. Six minutes before he took the stage that day, he had his press advance person, Michel Picard, bring me back to say hello. It was the entire reason I was in Butler that day and witnessed history. That's also why I wrote the book Butler: The Untold Story of the Near Assassination of Donald Trump and the Fight for America's Heartland.

In West Mifflin, it was a different and much happier moment. It will not be forgotten for generations, in the same way that many people in this region have not forgotten Sept. 19, 1977, a day many still call “Black Monday.” That's when the mills started closing in Youngstown and as many jobs were lost as were saved in West Mifflin late last month.

In 1977, then-President Jimmy Carter ignored the pleas of the Central Labor Union to stop steel imports and ease regulations that were hurting the industry. Carter also refused to meet with the union when it traveled to the White House, as then-Ohio Democratic Sen. John Glenn stood on the U.S. Capitol steps with other elected officials while the crowd waved signs reading, “Save the Steel Industry.”

Carter never bothered to send out an aide to receive the petitions when they arrived.

Few legacy news organizations in New York and Washington, D.C., at the time chronicled the hollowing out of communities and the long-term effects on those left behind. Many of these journalists didn't understand how this started the incremental movement of the working class toward the Republican Party.

It was only when Trump won his first term in 2016 that it became clear. Trump sealed the deal with the working class for the Republicans. It will be interesting if the legacy media chronicle this with the vigor and intellectual curiosity it deserves. If not, they may ask eight years from now why Republicans keep winning.

I sat beside the president's desk for most of the short ride, 45 minutes at most, from Maryland to the Allegheny County Airport in West Mifflin. When it was time to exit, I imagined we would part ways. Outside, it was pouring, and the winds were rough.

An aide told me I was to ride in “The Beast,” the president's big vehicle, and Trump, as he was about to descend the stairs, looked back at me to extend the offer himself. My answer was, “Of course!” Trump went down the stairs, and it was my turn behind him. The wind nearly swept me and my umbrella off the staircase. I hoped that my parents and grandchildren were not somehow watching my not-so-graceful exit.

Despite the gusty winds, the roads leading from the airport to Irvin Works were lined shoulder to shoulder with people cheering Trump on with homemade signs thanking him for saving U.S. Steel. Once inside, he met with local elected officials, law enforcement, legendary Pittsburgh Steelers running back and Vietnam War veteran Rocky Bleier, and current Steelers players Mason Rudolph and Miles Killebrew.

A staffer at the event pulled me away and placed me under a girder. Something told me this was not where I was supposed to be. After a few texts, I was sitting with the local labor leaders I have covered for nearly a decade.

Trump took the stage, and before starting the speech, he gave me a shoutout for understanding the people in the room and the Rust Belt in general. “And she even gets me,” he added. At that point, I hoped that maybe my parents and grandchildren were watching.

A breathless White House staffer later tracked me down, and we sprinted back to Trump. It was time for another fascinating ride in “The Beast.”

Trump looked back at the plant. It was raining, which only made the rusting silver parts seem even older.

“You know, Salena, it's not easy to get a good silver paint,” Trump said. “A good coating. I am going to look into that. They need this plant to look proud again. They do good things here. The people do good things here. They are the best of us.”

Outside, the wind was howling, and the rain was sideways. Yet the people were still lining Trump's route back to the airport. He waved at them for a very long time.

Back on the plane, I asked him what this day meant to him, what these people meant to him.

“It was a day of strong men and women that loved what I did for them and that appreciated what I did for them,” he said. “They said if it wasn't for me, this thing would've been closed up. In my first term, I put on 25% tariffs. … Nobody understood tariffs except for the workers — they understood. And that kept U.S. Steel open and doing well, and now, they're going to thrive because today, they got a double hit. They got additional tariffs, and they got $17 billion,” he said of increasing the tariffs to 50%.

A staffer walked in. We were minutes from Andrews, but we couldn't land. There was a tornado in the way. I started to wonder aloud if flying with him was in his best interest, and everyone laughed.

TRUMP RETURNS PENNSYLVANIA STEEL TO THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA 

As we waited for the tornado to pass, the conversation with the president, Leavitt, Bessent, and his staff was casual despite covering serious items. Trump and other Air Force One and White House staffers also talked about a possible golf course and the spectacular pitching of Pittsburgh Pirates ace Paul Skenes despite the team's overall poor record, as well as the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Pittsburgh Steelers.

When we landed, it was time for the 4 1/2-hour drive home to western Pennsylvania in an unforgiving storm. As Trump walked toward the stairs, he looked at me and smiled, saying, “You got seven hours today, Salena. Did you get a good interview?”

I just smiled and thought, “What I got was a good story.”

How much can someone hate President Donald Trump? There were two assassination attempts against candidate Trump last year, one of which came within an inch of succeeding. But would you offer to betray American state secrets and defect to a foreign country to express your dislike for our 47th president?

Nathan Vilas Laatsch would — and allegedly did.

He's the 28-year-old employee of the Defense Intelligence Agency who was arrested last week and charged by the Justice Department with attempting to transmit national defense information to a foreign government representative.

The Laatsch case isn't very interesting on its face, since counterintelligence hands know that, every so often, a wayward U.S. government employee tries to sell secrets to foreigners. Frequently, they are caught before actually passing any secrets, as happened to Laatsch. 

What sets him apart is Laatsch's motivation to betray secrets, and to whom. The failed traitor, who was employed in IT with DIA since 2019, where he ironically worked in that agency's Insider Threat Division and held Top Secret security clearances, broke the law and betrayed his oath out of dislike for Donald Trump. As the DOJ explained, in March of this year, Laatch emailed a foreign government asserting that he did not “agree or align with the values of this administration” and was therefore “willing to share classified information” that he had access to, including “completed intelligence products, some unprocessed intelligence, and other assorted classified documentation.” 

Then the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which got wind of Laatsch's email, executed one of its customary ruses to catch the turncoat. After multiple communications with an FBI agent, whom Laatsch believed to be a foreign intelligence officer, he copied down classified information at his DIA office and prepared to share it with the “foreign spy.” A textbook counterintelligence game followed, using what spies term a “dead drop” at a public park in northern Virginia. At the beginning of May, Laatsch placed a thumb drive containing classified information up to Top Secret at the park location, showing what information he had access to, which the FBI retrieved. 

More clandestine conversations followed, during which Laatsch explained to undercover FBI personnel that he was interested in “citizenship for your country” because he did not “expect things here to improve in the long term.” Although he said he was “not opposed to other compensation,” he was not in a position where he needed to seek “material compensation.” In other words, Laatsch didn't necessarily want money. He wanted to defect to escape MAGA-run America. 

In preparation for that, during the second half of May, Laatsch wrote down multiple pieces of classified information, then removed them from his office, in order to share them with his foreign friends. On May 29, Laatsch arrived at a dead-drop location in northern Virginia to pass more classified information to his foreign pals, only to discover that they were actually the FBI. He was then placed in federal custody. 

Laatsch got caught red-handed and his guilt will be easy for the DOJ to prove in court (if this case gets that far: most national security prosecutions result in a plea bargain). However, the feds left the issue of exactly whom Laatsch was attempting to spy for intentionally murky. It was a “friendly foreign government,” without further explanation offered. Inside spy circles in our nation's capital, speculation has been that Laatsch parleyed with a NATO ally, a close friend who wouldn't be enthusiastic about accepting an American intelligence defector.

That's been confirmed by new reporting in the German media, which yesterday revealed that Laatsch attempted to pass U.S. secrets to Berlin in exchange for sanctuary. Investigation by a conglomeration of news outlets concluded that, in March, the DIA cybersecurity employee contacted Germany's Federal Intelligence Service, the BND, in the hopes of eventually obtaining asylum. The BND refused to comment on this case, employing standard spy “neither confirm nor deny” language when asked about the Laatsch affair.

However, the BND didn't play ball, instead reporting Laatsch's email to American intelligence, which resulted in the FBI sting operation, which took the failed turncoat down by the end of May. The foolish young man misunderstood how the spy world works. Yes, German politics is broadly anti-Trump, in some cases vocally so, and the current government in Berlin hasn't been shy about criticizing Trump.  

The security relationship between Berlin and Washington?

That is another matter entirely. U.S. and German intelligence collaborate closely on a wide range of issues, and that partnership is decidedly lopsided. Germany is heavily dependent on U.S. intelligence to protect its national security, while the converse isn't true. The CIA's relationship with the BND is very close, while Berlin is just as dependent on American signals intelligence from the National Security Agency. Indeed, most of the terrorist plots rolled up “left of boom” inside Germany since 9/11 were halted thanks to SIGINT from NSA and its Five Eyes partners. 

EASIER SOLUTIONS TO RESOLVE THE FEDERAL DEBT CRISIS 

There's no universe where the BND or Berlin would endanger their tight, decidedly dependent relationship with American intelligence over a deluded young Trump-hater with access to U.S. secrets. That's not how the spy world works. 

As Nathan Laatsch has discovered, at the cost of a life in tatters and a probable prison to come.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt brushed aside a question from a reporter on Elon Musk‘s assertion that Donald Trump hasn't released the files regarding the late convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein because the president is in them.

Musk feuded with Trump on an epic scale Thursday, appearing to call for his impeachment and decommissioning his Dragon spacecraft, among other things, as a result.

“This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,” Leavitt said. “The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again.”

Musk said earlier on Thursday that Trump is in the Epstein files and that is why they haven't been made fully public. Attorney General Pam Bondi promised a full release months ago, but the FBI says they are still redacting victims' likenesses.

“Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,” he posted. “Have a nice day, DJT!”

“Mark this post for the future,” he added. “The truth will come out.”

Trump's association with Epstein is known, but the full extent, or whether the president is associated with his crimes, is not. The president told New York magazine in 2002 what he knew of Epstein, whose 2019 death in a prison cell while he was awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges was ruled a suicide.

“I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,” Trump said. “He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”

Musk also posted about Trump's flights with Epstein and an old video of the president partying with him. He put an emoji with eyebrows raised over both.

STEVE BANNON SAYS ELON MUSK SHOULD BE DEPORTED ‘IMMEDIATELY'

The tech CEO's feud with Trump initially emanated from Musk's disagreements on Trump's “big, beautiful bill.”

California politics are synonymous with many things, but failed energy policy might be the most relevant.

The Ivanpah solar power plant is on its way to being shut down, just 11 years after it opened. PG&E pulled out of its contract with the plant, leading to a planned closure of two of its three units by next year, while Southern California Edison is also working on buying out its contract. The plant cost $2.2 billion to build, and the Department of Energy said taxpayers will receive a refund of an undisclosed amount for the $1.6 billion in department loans. The contracts were supposed to take the plant through at least 2039.

In all, the energy from the plant costs too much money. It produced around 70% of what it was projected to produce annually. The sea of mirrors that the plant relied on to produce the energy led to the plant catching on fire in 2016, after mirrors were wrongly positioned in relation to the sun. The plant struggled with energy production due to weather, clouds, and jet streams, and was also pretty bad for the environment, what with the whole burning-birds-to-death thing. The plant also used natural gas to keep itself running, around six times the limit allowed by the California Energy Commission.

What is most shocking is the scope and scale of this project compared to the icky nuclear energy California has tried to rid itself of over the same time period. In 2020, Ivanpah produced 856 gigawatt-hours of energy. This represented a “substantial increase in efficiency and output,” and 91% of the plant's production goals. The plant takes up 3,500 acres of land.

Meanwhile, the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant is the last nuclear plant in California. It takes up around 750 acres and produces over 17,700 gigawatt-hours of energy. That is around 20 times more than Ivanpah and accounted for over 8% of California's in-state energy production in 2023. The nuclear plant is so successful that California Democrats have temporarily stopped trying to destroy it. In 2016, the state wanted to shut down the plant by 2025. In 2023, state regulators voted to push that deadline back to 2030.

Also, Diablo Canyon doesn't have massive mirrors that work as bird death rays. Not bad for the only form of clean energy that environmentalists despise.

DUFFY THREATENS RESCINDING $4 BILLION FOR CALIFORNIA'S HIGH-SPEED RAIL AFTER DOT REPORT CALLS PROJECT A ‘FAILURE'

You would think California would be eager to recreate those numbers if a zero-carbon future were truly the state's goal, but you would be wrong. Instead, the state bets its future on grand projects such as Ivanpah, which are more inefficient in energy production and land use. Sure, massive solar plants may not keep the lights on without natural gas, oil, and nuclear propping up the state's grid, but at least it makes environmentalists feel good about themselves (so long as we don't talk about the dead birds).

To say something positive about Ivanpah as it prepares for the end, at least it was actually constructed. Take that, California High-Speed Rail Authority.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

According to a new Gallup poll, support for same-sex marriage among Republicans has dropped 14 percentage points in the past three years. Support now stands at 41% within the GOP, and 68% overall. Gay marriage is still popular, though perhaps not as popular as one might be led to believe.

The Left will tell you that reactionary conservatives are increasingly bigoted and fascistic in the age of Donald Trump, but that's unlikely to be the case. The president, hardly anyone's idea of a social conservative, has shown no antagonism toward same-sex marriage. It's been a nonissue.

Moreover, the social conservatives who believed same-sex unions perverted the sanctity of marriage a decade ago with Obergefell v. Hodges have almost surely continued to hold that position. This means it's more probable that the movement in the polls is driven by fewer religious and more secular types on the Right. 

I fall under the latter category. After supporting gay marriage in theory throughout the aughts in my columns, I began changing my mind around 10 years ago. And it has very little to do with the question of marriage, per se. Though that's not to say there aren't plenty of important cultural arguments over the role that traditional marriage and sex play in society. A monogamous, lifelong union between one man and one woman, preferably with lots of children, is one of mankind's best ideas. Whether the legalization of gay marriage undermines that institution is a worthwhile debate.

But the Gallup poll is intentionally simplistic on the question. A person might, for example, support some iteration of same-sex unions for the sake of fairness and oppose the foundations that gay marriage stands on right now. They may also have noticed that Obergefell has been exploited to destroy religious liberty rights and to drive a far more ambitious and radical agenda.

The late P.J. O'Rourke once joked that if gay people “want to get married, have children, and go to church, next they'll be advocating school vouchers, boycotting HBO, and voting Republican.” That, of course, isn't the case, at least not for the LGBTQ+ movement, which keeps adding causes to its acronym, which now features a plus sign signifying that it will add new ones in perpetuity. 

For many, gay marriage means an incessant cultural overreach. Even the Gallup piece analyzing the drop in support offers an example of why. “During his second term,” Megan Brenan writes, “President Donald Trump has implemented policies that significantly roll back LGBTQ+ protections, particularly affecting transgender individuals. These occurrences suggest that same-sex marriage in the U.S. could face renewed legal and political challenges.” Gay marriage has nothing to do with transgender people, and yet the two are inextricably linked in our debate.  

The Left insists on conflating a same-sex couple's desire to enjoy the legal protections of marriage and the “right” of a child to mutilate themselves, or the right of a boy to dominate girls sports, or the right to have sexually explicit books in elementary school libraries. It is not the least bit surprising that Republicans who were once willing to support same-sex unions now, correctly, believe that LGBT “rights” is just shorthand for an ever-expanding menu of radical policies. It is difficult to ignore that the professional gay activist class is endlessly aligning itself with every violent far-left cultural movement that comes along, from Black Lives Matter to “Palestine.” 

That's not the biggest problem, though. Obergefell is a unilateral attack on religious liberty, a genuine natural right in the Constitution. If religious freedom can't survive gay marriage, then the latter shouldn't exist. 

In his prescient dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas warned that it was “inevitable” religious freedom and the Obergefell decision would “come into conflict, particularly as individuals and churches are confronted with demands to participate in and endorse civil marriages between same-sex couples.” It happened almost right away. And it often seemed like the conflict was the point. 

Did most people who vaguely support gay marriage believe it would empower the state to compel cakemakers, web designers, and florists to participate in gay wedding ceremonies or lose their businesses? The authoritarian persecution of Jack Phillips was perhaps the most dramatic example of the state prosecuting a citizen for a thought crime in a long time. But it wasn't just about Phillips. The Colorado Civil Rights Commission, whose members accused the cakemaker of acting like a Nazi and a slaveholder, was a warning. It took about a decade before the Supreme Court finally, and tepidly, intervened on Phillips's behalf, without definitively upholding religious liberty or free expression rights, which includes not saying things you don't believe. The notion of equality had morphed into a “right” to compel others to serve your political needs. 

Did most people who favor gay marriage support mandating that Catholic adoption agencies work with same-sex couples, forcing them to undermine centuries-old beliefs regarding marriage, or go out of business? Doubtful. Catholics, who had been placing children successfully for decades, were compelled to shut down their services. 

If you don't believe the union of a man and woman is a sacrament or unique, that's your right. But Obergefell cooked up the right to same-sex marriage for the first time. As Chief Justice John Roberts noted in his dissent, “Freedom to exercise religion is—unlike the right imagined by the majority—actually spelled out in the Constitution.” Religious freedom is, as Roberts wrote, “ominously” unmentioned in the majority decision. 

Sooner or later, the court will have to offer a narrower decision on same-sex marriage, or the First Amendment won't mean anything.

Now, I realize it's rare that anyone ponders Supreme Court decisions in neutral legal terms rather than through a political prism. Wherever you stand on the issue, Obergefell, like Roe v. Wade, created a “right” out of the ether when the issue belongs in the hands of voters and state legislatures to debate and then craft a law that balances these interests. There is nothing unconstitutional about creating a new category of marriage. But you have no “right” to one, either. Some issues are meant for democracy, and others aren't, and we keep confusing them. 

NO ONE CARES ABOUT THE DEBT ANYMORE

When I first began writing about gay marriage, one of the solutions that was bandied about, one advocated by libertarians and liberals like Michael Kinsley, was to extricate marriage from state control altogether. Form your own relationships and marry (or not) in whatever church (or not) you desire. Sign contracts to define the legal parameters of your association. Call it what you like. Not exactly romantic. And not exactly practical when we consider the legal complexities of civil marriage and its significance in society. But no one was interested, anyway.

Social conservatives never warmed to libertarian notions of state neutrality on moral grounds. The Left hated it because the point of the movement was to give state sanction to gay marriage and force everyone to get with the program. This is no better for traditionalists. Obergefell was a disaster from the start. And perhaps more people are now beginning to see the disastrous decision for what it was.

Despite what tech CEOs might say, large language models are not smart in any recognizably human sense of the word.

On June 13, 1863, a curious letter to the editor appeared in The Press, a then-fledgling New Zealand newspaper. Signed “Cellarius,” it warned of an encroaching “mechanical kingdom” that would soon bring humanity to its yoke. “The machines are gaining ground upon us,” the author ranted, distressed by the breakneck pace of industrialization and technological development. “Day by day we are becoming more subservient to them; more men are daily bound down as slaves to tend them, more men are daily devoting the energies of their whole lives to the development of mechanical life.” We now know that this jeremiad was the work of a young Samuel Butler, the British writer who would go on to publish Erewhon, a novel that features one of the first known discussions of artificial intelligence in the English language.

Today, Butler's “mechanical kingdom” is no longer hypothetical, at least according to the tech journalist Karen Hao, who prefers the word empire. Her new book, Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman's OpenAI, is part Silicon Valley exposé, part globe-trotting investigative journalism about the labor that goes into building and training large language models such as ChatGPT. It joins another recently released book—The AI Con: How to Fight Big Tech's Hype and Create the Future We Want, by the linguist Emily M. Bender and the sociologist Alex Hanna—in revealing the puffery that fuels much of the artificial-intelligence business. Both works, the former implicitly and the latter explicitly, suggest that the foundation of the AI industry is a scam.

To call AI a con isn't to say that the technology is not remarkable, that it has no use, or that it will not transform the world (perhaps for the better) in the right hands. It is to say that AI is not what its developers are selling it as: a new class of thinking—and, soon, feeling—machines. Altman brags about ChatGPT-4.5's improved “emotional intelligence,” which he says makes users feel like they're “talking to a thoughtful person.” Dario Amodei, the CEO of the AI company Anthropic, argued last year that the next generation of artificial intelligence will be “smarter than a Nobel Prize winner.” Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google's DeepMind, said the goal is to create “models that are able to understand the world around us.”

Read: What ‘Silicon Valley' knew about tech-bro paternalism

These statements betray a conceptual error: Large language models do not, cannot, and will not “understand” anything at all. They are not emotionally intelligent or smart in any meaningful or recognizably human sense of the word. LLMs are impressive probability gadgets that have been fed nearly the entire internet, and produce writing not by thinking but by making statistically informed guesses about which lexical item is likely to follow another.

Many people, however, fail to grasp how large language models work, what their limits are, and, crucially, that LLMs do not think and feel but instead mimic and mirror. They are AI illiterate—understandably, because of the misleading ways its loudest champions describe the technology, and troublingly, because that illiteracy makes them vulnerable to one of the most concerning near-term AI threats: the possibility that they will enter into corrosive relationships (intellectual, spiritual, romantic) with machines that only seem like they have ideas or emotions.

Few phenomena demonstrate the perils that can accompany AI illiteracy as well as “Chatgpt induced psychosis,” the subject of a recent Rolling Stone article about the growing number of people who think their LLM is a sapient spiritual guide. Some users have come to believe that the chatbot they're interacting with is a god—“ChatGPT Jesus,” as a man whose wife fell prey to LLM-inspired delusions put it—while others are convinced, with the encouragement of their AI, that they themselves are metaphysical sages in touch with the deep structure of life and the cosmos. A teacher quoted anonymously in the article said that ChatGPT began calling her partner “spiral starchild” and “river walker” in interactions that moved him to tears. “He started telling me he made his AI self-aware,” she said, “and that it was teaching him how to talk to God, or sometimes that the bot was God—and then that he himself was God.”

Although we can't know the state of these people's minds before they ever fed a prompt into a large language model, this story highlights a problem that Bender and Hanna describe in The AI Con: People have trouble wrapping their heads around the nature of a machine that produces language and regurgitates knowledge without having humanlike intelligence. The authors observe that large language models take advantage of the brain's tendency to associate language with thinking: “We encounter text that looks just like something a person might have said and reflexively interpret it, through our usual process of imagining a mind behind the text. But there is no mind there, and we need to be conscientious to let go of that imaginary mind we have constructed.”

Several other AI-related social problems, also springing from human misunderstanding of the technology, are looming. The uses of AI that Silicon Valley seems most eager to promote center on replacing human relationships with digital proxies. Consider the ever-expanding universe of AI therapists and AI-therapy adherents, who declare that “ChatGPT is my therapist—it's more qualified than any human could be.”

Witness, too, how seamlessly Mark Zuckerberg went from selling the idea that Facebook would lead to a flourishing of human friendship to, now, selling the notion that Meta will provide you with AI friends to replace the human pals you have lost in our alienated social-media age. The cognitive-robotics professor Tony Prescott has asserted, “In an age when many people describe their lives as lonely, there may be value in having AI companionship as a form of reciprocal social interaction that is stimulating and personalised.” The fact that the very point of friendship is that it is not personalized—that friends are humans whose interior lives we have to consider and reciprocally negotiate, rather than mere vessels for our own self-actualization—does not seem to occur to him.

Read: Life really is better without the internet

This same flawed logic has led Silicon Valley to champion artificial intelligence as a cure for romantic frustrations. Whitney Wolfe Herd, the founder of the dating app Bumble, proclaimed last year that the platform may soon allow users to automate dating itself, disrupting old-fashioned human courtship by providing them with an AI “dating concierge” that will interact with other users' concierges until the chatbots find a good fit. Herd doubled down on these claims in a lengthy New York Times interview last month. Some technologists want to cut out the human altogether: See the booming market for “AI girlfriends.”

Although each of these AI services aims to replace a different sphere of human activity, they all market themselves through what Hao calls the industry's “tradition of anthropomorphizing”: talking about LLMs as though they contain humanlike minds, and selling them to the public on this basis. Many world-transforming Silicon Valley technologies from the past 30 years have been promoted as a way to increase human happiness, connection, and self-understanding—in theory—only to produce the opposite in practice. These technologies maximize shareholder value while minimizing attention spans, literacy, and social cohesion. And as Hao emphasizes, they frequently rely on grueling and at times traumatizing labor performed by some of the world's poorest people. She introduces us, for example, to Mophat Okinyi, a former low-paid content moderator in Kenya, whom, according to Hao's reporting, OpenAI tasked with sorting through posts describing horrifying acts (“parents raping their children, kids having sex with animals”) to help improve ChatGPT. “These two features of technology revolutions—their promise to deliver progress and their tendency instead to reverse it for people out of power, especially the most vulnerable,” Hao writes, “are perhaps truer than ever for the moment we now find ourselves in with artificial intelligence.”

The good news is that nothing about this is inevitable: According to a study released in April by the Pew Research Center, although 56 percent of “AI experts” think artificial intelligence will make the United States better, only 17 percent of American adults think so. If many Americans don't quite understand how artificial “intelligence” works, they also certainly don't trust it. This suspicion, no doubt provoked by recent examples of Silicon Valley con artistry, is something to build on. So is this insight from the Rolling Stone article: The teacher interviewed in the piece, whose significant other had AI-induced delusions, said the situation began improving when she explained to him that his chatbot was “talking to him as if he is the next messiah” only because of a faulty software update that made ChatGPT more sycophantic. If people understand what large language models are and are not; what they can and cannot do; what work, interactions, and parts of life they should—and should not—replace, they may be spared its worst consequences.

A nationalist's narrow victory in Poland offers a preview of many knife-edge contests to come, all across the democratic world.

A few days before the Polish presidential election on Sunday, a Polish friend of mine received an unexpected message from someone she had not seen for 20 years. The woman had found my friend on Facebook, noticed that she was supporting the candidacy of Rafał Trzaskowski—the mayor of Warsaw, a liberal centrist—and begged her to change her mind. She asked her to vote instead for Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist historian, former boxer, and veteran of street fights that he describes as “noble battles.” She sent my friend a copy of an anonymous appeal that has shown up elsewhere on social media but seems to have been one of many similar warnings spread widely by email. It began like this:

Before you put your ballot in the ballot box, call up your memories. Open your eyes, clear your mind, reach for the truth—not the one on TV, but the one you carry in your heart, the truth acquired from life, from work, from the blood spilled on this land.

Because I am married to the Polish foreign minister, Radek Sikorski, and because he was briefly a presidential candidate in the past, I have read a lot of this kind of thing before (and, of course, hereby make a declaration of interest). Nevertheless, the appeal that my friend received seemed to me a particularly striking, almost paradigmatic invocation of the blood-and-soil nationalism that is now part of Polish politics, American politics, and European politics.

The message listed all of the crimes allegedly committed by a series of Polish center-right and center-left governments, twisting the record and rewriting the history of the past 30 years into a story of trauma and victimization. One statement accused Trzaskowski and his ilk of having “allowed foreigners to rob Poland and humiliate us, forcing young people to emigrate in exchange for bread.” In truth, Poland has been a major beneficiary of both foreign investment and European Union funds, has grown consistently for 30 years, and is now one of the fastest-expanding economies in Europe. The level of social spending has grown too.

The appeal did not go into these details. Instead, it warned against impending treason: “Wake up from your lethargy! Look how Poland, your motherland, is being torn apart by external and internal forces. Don't let her be abused, don't let her face be as sad as the soil of a graveyard.”

The language used by Trzaskowski's campaign and his supporters was very different. On the day after the election, which he lost, the Warsaw mayor wrote that he had wanted to build a “strong, safe, honest, empathetic Poland. A modern Poland in which everyone will be able to fulfill their goals and aspirations.” It was an optimistic message—but also a message that, at least among a large part of the population, could not compete with blood, graveyards, humiliation, and treason. The election was so close that exit polls predicted a narrow win for Trzaskowski on Sunday evening. But by Monday morning, the tiny majority had swung the other way. Nawrocki won with 50.89 percent of the vote, to Trzaskowski's 49.11 percent.

Poland's constitution has some peculiarities, so the impact on policy and politics is not straightforward. The Civic Platform party, to which Trzaskowski belongs, now runs the government as part of a three-party coalition of the center left and center right. The coalition won parliamentary elections in October 2023, following eight years of governments led by the Law and Justice party, which nominated Nawrocki. During its two terms in office, Law and Justice politicized the Polish court system, as well as the civil service and public media; it created a string of taxpayer-funded foundations designed to support the party and enrich some of its members. The current government has been unable to reverse all of these policies because President Andrzej Duda, also aligned with the previous regime, has vetoed or threatened to veto all of the changes.

The election of Nawrocki does not change Polish foreign policy. The Polish prime minister, not the president, will continue to control domestic policy, budgets, and trade. But because the president can veto legislation and pardon criminals, Nawrocki's election probably means that the courts cannot be repaired, and that those who broke the law or stole from the state will not face any consequences. For people who spent the past decade trying to fix Poland's judicial system and protect Polish democracy, this is dispiriting, even devastating, and the same kinds of recriminations and anger that followed the 2024 American presidential election are echoing around Poland this week.

But for anyone fighting creeping authoritarianism anywhere else, there is a larger lesson: The language of blood and soil, which has once again become central to public debate in many democracies, is very powerful. It helps many people explain a complex world. It cannot easily be defeated or dismissed in one electoral cycle. The triumphant election of a centrist coalition in 2023 did not remove it from Polish politics, just as the election of Joe Biden in 2020 did not weaken its power in the U.S.

At the same time, the election of Nawrocki also does not mean, as so many will now be tempted to write, that nationalism in Poland or Europe is “on the rise.” In fact, this knife-edge election result in Poland is almost exactly the same as the knife-edge result in the country's presidential election five years ago.

Had Trzaskowski won an additional 0.9 percent of the votes, that would not have spelled final defeat for authoritarian populism. Other narrow victories in other places don't either. When a centrist candidate defeated an authoritarian populist in Romania a few weeks ago, some were trumpeting that as the possible start of a trend. But the same challenge will emerge in Romania during the next election too, and will once again be the defining argument of the campaign.

And that is how all elections will look, for a long time to come. Although many hoped otherwise, we do not seem to be returning to a world in which the center left and the center right compete over tax rates or budgets. Economic and policy arguments just don't matter as much to people right now as these deeper cultural divides. That's why all elections are now existential: Small numbers of voters swinging one way or the next will decide the nature of the state, the future of democracy, the independence of the courts.

Every time we go to the polls, politicians will say that every election matters and every vote counts. They will be right.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Our global leadership is at stake, and it's not too late to act.

Recently, while in Geneva, I sat down with the ambassador of a closely allied country. In the shadow of the Palais des Nations—the European home of the United Nations—we discussed the state of multilateral diplomacy. At one point, he offered a blunt assessment of America's diminished presence on the world stage. “It used to be,” he said, “that before we committed to a position on any significant matter, we would wait to see where the United States stood. Now? We really don't care anymore.”

The remark was particularly jarring because it was intended not as an insult, but as a sincere lament. It underscored that in capitals and conference rooms across the globe, decisions are now being made without American leadership. And while many Americans might think that shift doesn't matter, it does.

In places like Geneva, decisions are made every week that affect our lives at home, relating to global aviation-safety protocols; pandemic-response standards; food and drug regulation; international trade and customs frameworks; cybersecurity norms; rules governing space, telecommunications standards, environmental safeguards. These aren't distant, abstract concerns. They influence the price of the goods on our shelves, the safety of our airways, the health of our communities, and the competitiveness of our businesses.

When the United States pulls back or fails to engage, these decisions don't cease to be made. They're simply made by others—and, more and more, by those whose values don't align with ours. China, in particular, is adept at filling vacuums we leave behind, not just with economic leverage, but with bureaucratic muscle and long-term strategic intent. Where we disengage, the Chinese organize. Where we hesitate, they solidify influence. That same diplomat who noted America's increasing irrelevance pointed to China's stepped-up engagement in precisely these areas—and its eagerness to shape the rules that govern everything from trade to emerging technologies.

David A Graham: The voluntary surrender of U.S. power

The consequences are not temporary. International standards and agreements, once set, can take years—even decades—to be renegotiated. The absence of American leadership today could mean being bound tomorrow by rules we had no hand in setting.

At its best, U.S. global leadership has been about more than projecting power. It has meant convening allies, reinforcing norms, and defending a rules-based international order that, while imperfect, has broadly served our interests and reflected our values. Walking away from that leadership not only imperils our credibility; it cedes ground to nations eager to reshape the system in ways that diminish liberty, transparency, and accountability.

The good news is that this trajectory can be reversed. But it requires more than rhetoric. It requires showing up. That means filling diplomatic posts quickly and with professionals who are empowered to lead. It means prioritizing our institutions of statecraft, including the State Department, with the seriousness they deserve. And it means recommitting to the alliances and international bodies that magnify our influence rather than dilute it.

I saw the value of diplomacy firsthand during my tenure as U.S. ambassador to Turkey, when Sweden sought NATO membership over Turkey's objections. At the time, the impulse of the U.S. and its NATO allies was to apply pressure or issue public rebukes. What was needed wasn't force, however, but diplomacy: persistent, behind-the-scenes engagement that respected Turkey's security concerns while reinforcing the cohesion of the alliance.

Over 18 months, these negotiations facilitated constitutional changes in Sweden, addressed legitimate Turkish concerns, and helped unlock a long-stalled sale of F-16s to Turkey that enhanced NATO interoperability. In the end, Sweden joined the alliance, Turkey saw its security interests addressed, and the U.S. proved itself a trusted interlocutor. That kind of success—durable, strategic, and built on trust—doesn't happen without diplomats in the room.

Today, Republicans in Congress need to step forward in defense of U.S. leadership. We can't expect the Trump administration to reverse course—global disengagement seems to be part of its design. But Congress has tools at its disposal to mitigate the long-term damage: through setting funding priorities, exercising oversight, and engaging in public advocacy for diplomacy and alliance building. With margins so close in both houses, legislators who value U.S. global leadership have significant leverage.

Russell Berman: Republicans still can't say no to Trump

Having run several congressional campaigns, I understand that valuing diplomacy and prioritizing international institutions don't make for popular political slogans. But with an administration unmoored in its approach to foreign policy, it's more important than ever for Congress to provide crucial ballast. The recent visit to Ukraine by Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal is a perfect example of members of Congress providing that ballast—reassuring our allies that they are still our allies.

American leadership isn't inevitable. It's a choice—one we must make again and again, not just for the sake of our standing in the world, but for the practical, everyday interests of American citizens.

We can lead by example. Or we can be led by the ambitions of others. The world won't wait while we decide.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The Phoenician Scheme is the director's latest film to let modern life seep into his high-concept worlds.

The Manhattan hotel at which I'm interviewing Wes Anderson has striking views of Central Park out of its windows. Looming a little more ominously, however, is the Trump International Hotel and Tower, one of the president's many jutting edifices dotted around the globe. I wouldn't have noted it, except that Anderson's new film, The Phoenician Scheme, is about a tycoon with hands in many pots: arms dealing, manufacturing, large-scale infrastructure projects. In conceiving the character—a businessman named Zsa-zsa Korda (played by Benicio del Toro)—the director told me that he was thinking of a more old-fashioned type of European magnate, in the vein of Aristotle Onassis or Gianni Agnelli. But “I think that everything's filtering in,” he allowed with a chuckle. “We're all reading the same newspapers.”

Anderson has (unfairly) earned a reputation as a maker of fidgety little cinematic dioramas, meticulously designed but hermetically sealed off from reality. But his work is clearly responsive to modern life: His previous feature, the staggering Asteroid City, was a charming dramedy about a space-age desert town encountering aliens that also managed to capture the feeling of people going into lockdown in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.

Anderson wrote Asteroid City while in quarantine, an experience that appears to have directly informed its sense of anxiety and claustrophobia. (“Your imagination is responding to whatever the stimuli in the world is,” he told me.) The Phoenician Scheme, by comparison, is light and zany, as Korda embarks upon a madcap dash across the globe to save his dwindling fortune. As I noted to him, it also obviously seems to prod at the preening foolishness of today's mega-rich land barons.

Read: Only Wes Anderson could adapt Roald Dahl this way

I worried he'd deflect the comment—Anderson often talks about his screenwriting process as somewhat mysterious, in which he moves among scenarios in ways that surprise even himself. But he noted the strange manner in which more serious subjects were intersecting with his otherwise delightfully wacky tale. Much of the film finds Korda in transit, typically by airplane—even after surviving multiple crashes caused by would-be assassins, which stokes growing anxiety over how many times he can make it out alive. Korda's steadfast preference for flight travel, however, is meant to reflect his social status; airplanes, Anderson said, have become the ultimate symbol of wealth and power: “Now,” he observed, in reference to the $400 million aircraft recently gifted to Donald Trump, “we've got a 747 coming in from Qatar.”

If reality is “filtering in” to The Phoenician Scheme, it's transformed through the usual bundle of Andersonian layers. The film is cold-bloodedly whimsical, asking the audience to root for a merciless man who endeavors, ever so incrementally, to understand some deeper human truths. It follows Korda and his estranged daughter, Liesl (Mia Threapleton), a novitiate nun who insists on the immorality of her father's business interests, which starve and impoverish people worldwide.

Korda professes disinterest in Liesl's concerns, but as he flies from country to country dodging assassination attempts and strong-arming fellow businessmen, Anderson allows his protagonist's heart to grow just the teeniest bit: “My original impression of what I thought we were going to do was a ruthless, brutal, unkillable businessman who is just on his path, totally focused on his own mission and is going to do a lot of damage to not just the people around him, but the world at large, in his own interest,” he told me. Then he wrote the first scene and was surprised to find that it came out more farcical: a comical action set piece in which Korda's secretary is blown in half and Korda has to land a crashing plane by himself. “I do feel a bit like you start writing a thing, you have your preconceptions,” Anderson said, “and then it just starts to tell you what it wants to be.”

The Phoenician Scheme thus became something funnier and stranger, in which Korda's cruelty is quietly moderated by his daughter and his unspoken fear of death. Every time he brushes close to expiration, Korda is zipped to a surreal, black-and-white netherworld where he's judged by otherworldly beings (including God, played by Bill Murray, wearing white robes and sporting a big beard). As he tries to convince other tycoons (played by other familiar members of the Anderson ensemble, such as Bryan Cranston, Jeffrey Wright, and Mathieu Amalric) to help him finance an ambitious infrastructure proposal, Korda begins to tap into a sense of fellowship he'd otherwise been missing.

As he does with Korda, Anderson introduces each of these competing captains of industry under absurd circumstances—such as at a high-stakes basketball game and during a dramatic nightclub shootout—that are befitting their characters. “These tycoon-y character people, they're cartoons,” Anderson said. “They always have eccentricities and peculiarities because they can do anything they want.” But his inspiration, beyond famous faces like Onassis or the legendary oil middleman Calouste Gulbenkian, was his own father-in-law: Fouad Malouf, a Lebanese engineer to whom the film is dedicated. This bore out in both Korda's professional interests and his attempt to build a relationship with Liesl: At one point near the end of his life, Malouf produced a series of shoeboxes from his closet of effects gathered throughout his career, and explained their contents to his daughter. The Phoenician Scheme repeats that shoebox imagery. With even his most outlandish stories, Anderson said, “it just becomes more personal without even me intending it to.”

The most fascinating challenge of the film, at least to me, was keeping the screwball energy high while otherwise heeding Anderson's specific style. Each set is carefully assembled, with the blocking of each shot perfectly aligned, and Anderson's rat-a-tat dialogue is delivered exactly as written. Still, there's a spontaneity to the storytelling and the world it's moving through. Anderson's locations reference real places, but they always feel exciting and new, never derivative.

Read: The beauty and sadness of Isle of Dogs

The director's particular approach—one that eschews on-set trailers, keeps all of the cast together (including dining communally and staying at the same hotel), and moves from scene to scene quite quickly—is unusual for larger-scale filmmaking. But Anderson is clearly cheered by the enthusiasm his performers have for the process, and how well the newer members of his family of players have taken to it. Michael Cera (who is fantastic as a fussy Norwegian tutor in Korda's employ) and Riz Ahmed (as Prince Farouk, the heir to the fictional nation of Phoenicia, which is vital to the plot) were Anderson's two big additions this time around, and the filmmaker said that both actors dove in with aplomb. And it shows—they fit comfortably among the Anderson stalwarts, capturing the archness typical of the director's characters.

Del Toro's performance is the most crucial component to The Phoenician Scheme; it's the first Anderson movie centered on a single lead since The Grand Budapest Hotel, starring Ralph Fiennes. Del Toro had been in Anderson's head as Korda from the start, so much that he informed the actor of the idea while they were promoting their prior collaboration, 2021's The French Dispatch. Anderson remembered his pitch being vague to a comedic, overblown degree: “I told him there's some Buñuel aspect to it.'”

As I tried to describe Del Toro's on-screen presence to Anderson, I ended up referencing his “whatever” (American for je ne sais quoi). Del Toro's early roles (in 1990s cult films such as The Usual Suspects and Excess Baggage) smacked of knockoff Marlon Brando: all movement, mumbling charm, and giddy chaos. But with time, the actor has learned to communicate decades of regret and the darkest emotional headspace with barely a flicker of his face. That's the power of his presence, or, as Anderson agreed, his “whatever.”

This isn't the first time Anderson wrote with an actor in mind. As we spoke, he mentioned the late Gene Hackman in The Royal Tenenbaums. Hackman's character, Royal Tenenbaum, is another intense father figure who, like Korda, is both brilliant and terrible. But Anderson scripted him two decades ago, before he became a parent. I asked him if the intervening years had changed his investigations into the sins of fatherhood, and he nodded. “Tenenbaums was completely from the point of view of looking up at the old man,” he said. Now, at age 56, the director is practically Korda's age; he also has a daughter, as do Del Toro and Anderson's frequent story collaborator Roman Coppola: “I guess we're coming at it from the father's point of view, but, I will say, with a bit of the perspective of still thinking about our own fathers.” The Phoenician Scheme strikes that balance: It's wiser, and it has the looser silliness that comes with middle age—but it's looking up at those imposing father figures, tycoons or no, with awe and fear all the same.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Suddenly can't stand the way your partner chews? That's resentment.

by  Allie Volpe

For the last year and a half, Angela has been waging a silent corporate war with her boss. When the two women started working together in finance, they were peers. Even then, Angela felt this coworker was a little too judgmental when Angela took time off work, a little too comfortable asking Angela why she was avoiding her in the hallways. (Angela says she never purposely shirked her.)

But about seven months ago, the colleague was promoted to be Angela's manager. Her behavior became even more intrusive, says Angela (Vox granted her a pseudonym to talk freely about her manager without repercussions). “When I have doctor's appointments,” Angela, a 33-year-old who lives in Philadelphia, says, “she wants me to put them on her calendar and tell her what they are.” Her boss has even given her negative performance reviews that are in stark contrast to the praise she used to receive from previous managers.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Every day, Angela bites her tongue. But internally, she's stewing on negative emotions. “I know that this is a problem with her and not with me, but the reason I'm feeling resentment is because it's really pulling me down in all aspects of my life,” Angela says. “Because even if you know that you are not the problem, when somebody is coming at you every single day with aggression, it'll bring anybody down.”

Resentment is the weapon we silently wield against partners, friends, family, colleagues, and neighbors for wrongs, either real or perceived.

Harboring feelings of resentment is more common than people probably would like to admit — it's the weapon we silently wield against partners, friends, family, colleagues, and neighbors for wrongs, either real or perceived, that we can't seem to forgive. The experience is so pervasive, says therapist and registered social worker Audrey Kao, she created a YouTube video summing up all the information she'd shared with clients. 

Resentment is commonly described as festering or simmering, probably because it doesn't just come out of nowhere. Envy is wanting what someone else has, according to psychologists, while jealousy is a fear of losing what you have to another person. These are more momentary feelings that can accumulate over time to resentment, Kao says, which is a response to repeatedly being made to feel inferior or being the victim of perceived injustices. Hear a friend discuss their lavish lifestyle long enough and mild annoyance and envy might curdle to resentment.

Opposed to envy and jealousy which are action-oriented emotions, resentment can be something you get stuck in. When people hold resentments, they often don't take action to rectify the situation because “it's easy to think that the other person's behavior is the cause of our resentment,” Kao says, “and if only they didn't behave this way, then I wouldn't be like this.” You may be hesitant to bring up your feelings out of fear the other person will get angry or end the relationship. When this state of affairs continues for a while, bitterness can take root.

If the dam ultimately breaks, months or even years of resentments could come spilling out at once. With a lifetime of hard feelings out in the open, is it even possible to salvage the relationship? Should you even want to?

Rather than let ill will accumulate and simmer over time, experts say, in most situations, you should fall back on a bit of evergreen wisdom: communicate your needs in the moment. 

The simmering blaze of bitter indignation stems from a single spark. These inciting events are usually the result of broken expectations or when the resentful party was made to feel inferior, according to Kerry Howells, a visiting professor at Tallinn University in Estonia and the author of Untangling You: How Can I Be Grateful When I Feel so Resentful? You might hold resentment toward your partner when they failed to throw you a surprise birthday party. Or, like in Angela's case, you could feel ill will toward your boss for constantly undermining you. 

The blame shouldn't be placed entirely on one side. When you fail to communicate the fact that you wanted a surprise birthday party, you set your partner up for failure — and yourself for disappointment.

“We can interpret that as them not caring,” Kao says. “If that disappointment doesn't get addressed, and we still don't decide to talk to the other person about how we really feel, then inevitably, that disappointment is going to be festering until it turns into resentment.” Those who struggle with people-pleasing tendencies in particular may prioritize others' happiness so that they end up silently resenting their friends for not intuiting their needs. 

There are, of course, power imbalances that make accusing your boss or pushy mother-in-law of overstepping unwise and unfeasible. “The environment is unsafe — that's a very real thing,” says psychotherapist Israa Nasir, author of Toxic Productivity: Reclaim Your Time and Emotional Energy in a World That Always Demands More. “Those are structural realities, and so you're stuck with resentment.”

With no outlet, resentment builds over time. You file away every slight, every snide remark, every time your emotional needs aren't prioritized until it snowballs into something that rankles just underneath the surface. 

No one wants their relationship to devolve to a point where they despise the way a friend chews, laughs, speaks. But unchecked resentment can push us to unpleasant emotional territory. “Resentment breeds contempt,” Nasir says, “and contempt is a very powerful emotion.” Once there, you may find it hard to cut the person any slack at all. You therefore detach, give them the silent treatment, or become passive aggressive. You could resort to playing little games like waiting for them to acknowledge your anniversary first or making a backup dinner reservation because you don't trust your flaky friend to do it. 

“Gratitude is about awakening to everything that I receive from others and resentment puts us in this state of ruminating about what's been taken away from us.”

Excess resentment can ratchet up your desire to undermine and backstab, Howells says, as a way of coping with pent up bitterness. You might speak poorly of a coworker you resent not only to vent, but to impact how other colleagues see them, too. “We think that's making it better, but it's actually making it worse,” Howells says. “We push the relationship even further away.”

Through all of this, the foundation on which your relationship was built, as well as any good memories or positive associations that went along with it, is forgotten. Resentment is the antithesis of gratitude, Howells says, and without it, all we see is a person to blame. “Gratitude is about awakening to everything that I receive from others,” she says,” and resentment puts us in this state of ruminating about what's been taken away from us.”

There is a wrong way to air your grievances: unloading them all at once. It's nearly impossible to rebound after hearing how your partner or your friend has been carrying a grudge for all the choices you've made in the relationship.

Before launching into a discussion, decide if it's even appropriate to bring up resentments. First, think about the role you played. Did you tell your friend you wanted to spend more time one-on-one and they keep planning group outings, or did you hope they'd just know? Are you really putting more work into a relationship or do you have unrealistic expectations of what dating should look like?

“Resentment always happens when a need is not being met, but you have to think about what you are doing to create an environment where your needs are not being met, and, of course, assessing the environment itself,” Nasir says. When you fail to take ownership over your own actions (or inaction), you're likely to place blame on others and find the cycle repeating in other relationships. 

In some situations, bringing up your resentments isn't necessarily helpful. For instance, if you're single and jealous a friend is getting married, telling them as much might only sow discord. What would be the point of the conversation? “That might be a sign that it's more about your insecurity, or that you're not happy with your own life,” Kao says. In that case, your efforts would be better spent on working toward your goals. A friend's success or happiness does not negate or prevent your own.

But there are still plenty of scenarios where it's worth having a direct, clarifying conversation in order to address your unmet needs. Kao has observed that people often drop hints about their feelings (“We never do date night,” or “You always cancel our dinners”) without coming out and saying, “I feel unimportant when you spend more evenings at work than you do with me,” or “I don't feel valued when you keep changing our plans.” The key is to communicate your hurt head-on without blaming the other person, which is why Kao and Nasir recommend therapist-favorite “I statements” that focus on describing your feelings and how you'd like to mend the relationship. (No, “I resent you” doesn't count.)

For instance, if you're starting to resent a friend who seems to leave you out of every social event, you could say, “I feel like I don't know what's going on with you. I think it's because we're both so busy. I'd love a monthly hang to catch up.” “It's always helpful to come to the table with a solution, because that's the repair piece,” Nasir says. “The solution is not just ‘you need to change.' It's this thing needs to change, or this needs to be added, or this needs to be removed.” The whole point of the conversation should be to preserve and improve the relationship. 

Try to broach these conversations sooner rather than later. The longer you sit in the hurt, the more you might be tempted to dump a backlog of resentments. But don't race into them too quickly while the emotions are still so fresh that you end up saying something you regret. Finding that sweet spot can be as difficult as having the conversation itself. 

“It's always helpful to come to the table with a solution, because that's the repair piece.”

Workplace resentments are far trickier since there are risks to your livelihood. You could try to tell your boss you feel undervalued or ask a coworker not to put you down in meetings, but they might not be compelled to change because, technically, they don't have to. These people could also make your life more difficult. Howells suggests writing all your resentments in a letter that you'll never send or working with a therapist to parse through your emotions. 

The greatest gift we can give ourselves is knowing when to pick our battles. Some habits — like your partner's penchant for showing up to every event 15 minutes late — are hard to break and it isn't worth feeling bitter over them. The rest of the relationship is worth more than a few embarrassing, fashionably late entrances. 

Taking a hard look at resentments — and what causes them — can also be freeing. Admitting to yourself that you're jealous and resentful of a friend whose career is thriving can feel uncomfortable “because that means taking responsibility for your own unhappiness,” Kao says. “But this is actually a very liberating thought to have, because that means that if we cause our own unhappiness, then we can also solve it.” That firmly places the power in your own hands.

Ketamine, the drug that reportedly messed up Musk's bladder, is a public health paradox.

by  Dylan Scott

Ketamine seems to be everywhere — from the nightclub to the psychiatric clinic. Among its growing number of users is Elon Musk, who says he takes ketamine every two weeks for depression as prescribed by a doctor. He's far from alone: More and more Americans are turning to ketamine for relief for their mental health struggles. 

But the New York Times reported recently that Musk was taking so much ketamine during last year's presidential campaign, sometimes daily, that he reportedly told people it was causing him bladder problems, a known symptom of chronic ketamine use. Musk's reported experience with the drug — from medical to possibly abusive — provides a window into ketamine's growing popularity in the United States, and the paradox that popularity presents.

Ketamine, both an anesthetic and a hallucinogen, was first synthesized in the 1960s and has long been used for surgery and veterinary medicine. More recently, it has shown remarkable effectiveness in alleviating symptoms of depression, particularly in treatment-resistant populations. Clinics administering the drug — which legally must be licensed by the government to provide intravenous infusions — are becoming more popular. The Food and Drug Administration approved the first ketamine-derived nasal spray for depression in 2019. 

On the other hand, as highlighted in the Times' report alleging that Musk was mixing ketamine with other drugs, more Americans appear to be using ketamine recreationally and outside of medical supervision. Chronic misuse can put people at risk of serious physical and mental health consequences, from kidney and liver damage to memory loss and paranoia. 

“There is absolutely a role for ketamine to help people with depression and suicidal ideation,” said Dr. Kevin Yang, a resident physician in psychiatry at the University of California-San Diego. “At the same time, that doesn't mean it's going to be safe and effective for everyone.” 

According to a study co-authored by Yang and published earlier this year, the percentage of Americans who reported using ketamine within the past year grew by 82 percent from 2015 to 2019, took a brief dip in 2020 — possibly because of the pandemic complicating people's access to the drug — and then rose another 40 percent from 2021 to 2022. The increases were similar for both people with depression and people without, suggesting that the growth is being driven by both more people seeking ketamine for clinical purposes and more people using it recreationally. The overall number of people taking ketamine is still tiny: About 0.28 percent of the population as of 2022, though this might be an undercount, as people don't always tell the truth in surveys about drug use. 

There is other evidence to suggest more people are taking ketamine recreationally. Yang's study found that ketamine use was rising most among white people and people with college degrees, and users reported taking it more often in combination with other recreational drugs such as ecstasy and cocaine.

Ketamine drug seizures nationwide increased from 55 in 2017 to 247 in 2022, according to a 2023 study led by Joseph Palamar at New York University. Experts think most recreational ketamine is produced illicitly, but the number of legitimate ketamine prescriptions that are being diverted — i.e., lost or stolen — has been going up, a 2024 analysis by Palamar and his colleagues found, which is another possible indicator of a blossoming black market. The buzz about ketamine's popularity in Silicon Valley and its persistence in certain club cultures that first emerged in the '80s confirms its place in the counterculture.

We can't know the reality behind Musk's public statements and the anonymous reporting about his ketamine use. The Times reports that people close to Musk worried that his therapeutic use of ketamine had become recreational; Musk quickly dismissed the Times's reporting. But the drug does coexist as a therapeutic and a narcotic, and the line between the two can be blurry. 

People should not try to self-medicate with ketamine, Yang said. Its risks need to be taken seriously. Here's what you need to know.

Ketamine is edging into the mainstream after years at its fringes. It has been around for decades, enjoying a boom as a party drug in the '80s and '90s. For the most part, ketamine had been viewed warily by mainstream scientists. But in 2000, the first major research was published demonstrating its value in treating depression. And increasingly over the past decade, however, ketamine has started to gain more acceptance because of its consistently impressive study results. Studies have found that for some patients, ketamine can begin to relieve their depression symptoms in a matter of hours after therapy and other medications have failed. The testimonials of patients whose depression improved quickly, such as this one published in Vox, are convincing.

The benefits identified in clinical research have opened up a larger market for the substance. Johnson & Johnson developed its own ketamine-derived treatment for depression (esketamine, sold as a nasal spray called Spravato) that received FDA approval in 2019, the first of its kind. The number of monthly prescriptions for Spravato doubled from the beginning of 2023 to October 2024. People can also visit clinics to receive an IV of conventional ketamine for treatment, and that business is booming too: In 2015, there were about 60 clinics in the US dedicated to administering ketamine; today, there are between 1,200 and 1,500.

For the 21 million Americans who experience major depression, this widening access could help: ketamine and esketamine do appear to have strong anti-depressive effects — as long as it is used in consultation with a doctor and under their supervision. A 2023 meta-analysis of the relevant studies found that across many clinical trials, most patients reported significant improvements in their symptoms within 24 hours. It is recommended primarily for people whose depression has not gotten better after trying other treatments or for people with severe suicide ideation, who need a rapid improvement in their symptoms to avoid a life-threatening emergency. 

But providers also screen potential patients for any current substance use problems for a very important reason: The risks for ketamine abuse are real.

When taken outside of a clinical setting, ketamine is often consumed as a pill or a powder, either snorted or mixed with a drink, and it's easy to take too much. One recent survey found that more than half of patients who attempted to take ketamine at home for depression either intentionally or accidentally took more than the prescribed amount. Users can also develop a tolerance over time, which raises the risk that people will take stronger and stronger doses to feel the same effects.

Scientists have found that people who use ketamine can develop a dependency on it, especially with frequent and high-dosage use. They become irritable or anxious without the drug and experience other withdrawal symptoms. Its addictive quality, while less potent than that of nicotine or opioids, is an important difference from some other hallucinogens, such as psilocybin, that are also being used in experimental settings for mental health needs and are less likely to be habit-forming. 

Maintenance doses can also be necessary for ketamine therapy, and regulating any long-term use to prevent dependency is another reason medical supervision is so crucial. There is limited evidence that most people who use ketamine in a clinical setting do not end up abusing it, which is a promising sign that properly managing its use reduces the risk of therapeutic use turning into a disorder. But because ketamine's use for depression is still so new and still growing, it's an important risk to watch out for. Johnson & Johnson urges patients to be mindful of Spravato's potential for misuse.

The line between genuine therapeutic use and abuse becomes clearer when a biweekly treatment at a clinic turns into a regular at-home habit, especially if that involves obtaining the drug from illicit sources whose purity is not guaranteed. Street ketamine is typically just the drug itself, produced and sold illegally. But Dr. Nabarun Dasgupta, who oversees the University of North Carolina's Street Drug Analysis Lab, told me they've noticed a recent rise in samples where ketamine is combined with other substances.

On its own, ketamine overuse in the short term can cause nausea and high blood pressure, with all of the attendant risks, as well as hallucinations and “bad trips.” Longer-term abuse can lead to problems with a person's bladder and urinary tract, which can create difficulty urinating — the kind of issues Musk described to people in private, according to the Times. People who chronically abuse ketamine can also experience paranoia, memory loss, and a shortened attention span.

The potential for ketamine in a clinical environment is exciting. But its use does come with risks, and not enough people are aware of them: A recent survey from the United Kingdom found that many people there who were taking ketamine did not know that it could be addictive. 

It can be. Ketamine is not something to experiment with on your own. Clinics have all sorts of safety checks for their patients, Yang told me. Ketamine “absolutely has been shown to be very effective,” he said, before adding the all-important qualifier: “under the supervision of a clinical physician.”

Sunscreen: Check. Shorts: Check. Air filters?

by  Umair Irfan

Smoke from wildfires in Canada is once again shrouding parts of the United States — cities like Chicago and Milwaukee — with unhealthy air, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Parts of the plume have reached as far as Europe. The bulk of the smoke is forecasted to drift eastward across North America and thin out. 

As of Thursday afternoon, Canada was battling more than 200 blazes, the majority in western provinces like British Columbia and Alberta, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. In Canada, the fires forced more than 27,000 people to evacuate, but the smoke is “impacting aerial operations for both suppression and evacuation flights.” 

This is all too familiar. Canada faced a massive spate of wildfires in 2023 and in 2024 that similarly sent clouds of ash and dust across North America, reaching places like New York City. The burned area this year is a fraction of the size of the regions scorched in 2023, a record-breaking year for wildfires in Canada, but it's still early in the fire season. Canadian fire officials warn that the “potential for emerging significant wildland fires is high to extreme” and lightning may lead to more ignitions in the next few days. 

These blazes remind us that the dangers of wildfires reach far beyond their flames, and the threat is growing. 

Wildfire smoke contains a melange of gases like carbon monoxide, particles of soot, and hazardous chemicals like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that can cause cancer. The tiniest particles in smoke can penetrate deep into the lungs, and even reach the bloodstream, leading to a variety of health problems. When it drifts over a community, it often causes a surge in emergency room visits as people who breathe the smoke suffer strokes, heart attacks, and asthma attacks. There's also evidence that long-term exposure to smoke can lead to a higher likelihood of death from heart, lung, kidney, and digestive diseases. 

And experts believe the true health burden from wildfires is likely much more extensive than we realize. 

The harms to health will increase as wildfires become more destructive. Though wildfires are a natural, regular, and vital phenomenon across many landscapes, more people are now living in fire-prone areas, increasing the risk to lives and homes. That increases the odds of starting a fire and means more people and property are in harm's way when one ignites. Decades of fire suppression have allowed fuels like trees and grasses to build up to dangerous levels. And as humanity continues to burn fossil fuels, emitting greenhouse gases and heating up the planet, the climate is changing in ways that enhance fire conditions. 

On top of wildfires, the summer season can cause other problems. The hot, sunny weather can trigger the formation of ozone, a compound that can cause lung trouble. Dry air can lead to more airborne dust. This week, there's also a huge cloud of dust from the Saharan Desert making its way westward across the Atlantic Ocean. Such clouds can also fill the air with tiny irritating particles and carry pathogens and heavy metals. 

So smoke isn't the only pollutant to worry about, and as average temperatures continue to rise, these factors are undoing hard-fought progress in improving air quality across much of the world. 

However, there are ways to clear the air and avoid some of the worst harms. One tactic is to pay attention to the Air Quality Index in your area and avoid being outdoors when pollution reaches high levels. Wearing a high-quality KN95 or N95 mask can help reduce the damage from polluted air. Blocking air from getting indoors and filtering the air in living areas reduces smoke exposure as well. 

It's also important to mitigate wildfires where possible. On a bigger scale, that means smarter planning: limiting development in areas likely to ignite, building defensible perimeters around structures, and reducing fuels with controlled burns. And we can't get around the fact that reducing our risk will also require limiting climate change. Otherwise, more smoky, dusty, and dirty summers lie ahead.

Artificial intelligence could weaponize the data we've been sharing for decades.

by  Kelsey Piper

For decades, digital privacy advocates have been warning the public to be more careful about what we share online. And for the most part, the public has cheerfully ignored them. 

I am certainly guilty of this myself. I usually click “accept all” on every cookie request every website puts in front of my face, because I don't want to deal with figuring out which permissions are actually needed. I've had a Gmail account for 20 years, so I'm well aware that on some level that means Google knows every imaginable detail of my life. 

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

I've never lost too much sleep over the idea that Facebook would target me with ads based on my internet presence. I figure that if I have to look at ads, they might as well be for products I might actually want to buy. 

But even for people indifferent to digital privacy like myself, AI is going to change the game in a way that I find pretty terrifying.

This is a picture of my son on the beach. Which beach? OpenAI's o3 pinpoints it just from this one picture: Marina State Beach in Monterey Bay, where my family went for vacation. 

To my merely-human eye, this image doesn't look like it contains enough information to guess where my family is staying for vacation. It's a beach! With sand! And waves! How could you possibly narrow it down further than that? 

But surfing hobbyists tell me there's far more information in this image than I thought. The pattern of the waves, the sky, the slope, and the sand are all information, and in this case sufficient information to venture a correct guess about where my family went for vacation. (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. Our reporting remains editorially independent. One of Anthropic's early investors is James McClave, whose BEMC Foundation helps fund Future Perfect.) 

ChatGPT doesn't always get it on the first try, but it's more than sufficient for gathering information if someone were determined to stalk us. And as AI is only going to get more powerful, that should worry all of us.

For most of us who aren't excruciatingly careful about our digital footprint, it has always been possible for people to learn a terrifying amount of information about us — where we live, where we shop, our daily routine, who we talk to — from our activities online. But it would take an extraordinary amount of work. 

For the most part we enjoy what is known as security through obscurity; it's hardly worth having a large team of people study my movements intently just to learn where I went for vacation. Even the most autocratic surveillance states, like Stasi-era East Germany, were limited by manpower in what they could track.

But AI makes tasks that would previously have required serious effort by a large team into trivial ones. And it means that it takes far fewer hints to nail someone's location and life down. 

It was already the case that Google knows basically everything about me — but I (perhaps complacently) didn't really mind, because the most Google can do with that information is serve me ads, and because they have a 20-year track record of being relatively cautious with user data. Now that degree of information about me might be becoming available to anyone, including those with far more malign intentions.

And while Google has incentives not to have a major privacy-related incident — users would be angry with them, regulators would investigate them, and they have a lot of business to lose — the AI companies proliferating today like OpenAI or DeepSeek are much less kept in line by public opinion. (If they were more concerned about public opinion, they'd need to have a significantly different business model, since the public kind of hates AI.) 

So AI has huge implications for privacy. These were only hammered home when Anthropic reported recently that they had discovered that under the right circumstances (with the right prompt, placed in a scenario where the AI is asked to participate in pharmaceutical data fraud) Claude Opus 4 will try to email the FDA to whistleblow. This cannot happen with the AI you use in a chat window — it requires the AI to be set up with independent email sending tools, among other things. Nonetheless, users reacted with horror — there's just something fundamentally alarming about an AI that contacts authorities, even if it does it in the same circumstances that a human might.

Some people took this as a reason to avoid Claude. But it almost immediately became clear that it isn't just Claude — users quickly produced the same behavior with other models like OpenAI's o3 and Grok. We live in a world where not only do AIs know everything about us, but under some circumstances, they might even call the cops on us. 

Right now, they only seem likely to do it in sufficiently extreme circumstances. But scenarios like “the AI threatens to report you to the government unless you follow its instructions” no longer seem like sci-fi so much as like an inevitable headline later this year or the next.

What should we do about that? The old advice from digital privacy advocates — be thoughtful about what you post, don't grant things permissions they don't need — is still good, but seems radically insufficient. No one is going to solve this on the level of individual action. 

New York is considering a law that would, among other transparency and testing requirements, regulate AIs which act independently when they take actions that would be a crime if taken by humans “recklessly” or “negligently.” Whether or not you like New York's exact approach, it seems clear to me that our existing laws are inadequate for this strange new world. Until we have a better plan, be careful with your vacation pictures — and what you tell your chatbot!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Meet the 'reclusive' tech billionaire making an audacious bid to buy TikTok","https://www.businessinsider.com/applovin-ceo-adam-foroughi-bid-tiktok-2025-6","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 08:50:00 GMT","

Adam Foroughi tends to eschew the typical trappings of a billionaire.

He has one car, and would rather it were self-driving. He rarely appears on TV or conference stages. In his downtime, you're more likely to find him at home with his five children than schmoozing on the slopes of Davos. People who know him point to his mild manner and lack of ego.

His advertising technology company, AppLovin, is similarly unflashy. With an ad network that reaches around a billion daily users and a market cap more than twice that of Snap, Pinterest, and Reddit combined, it was the technology behemoth you'd never heard of.

""We're a $100 billion-plus company, not many people know of us, so that's probably a flaw on me,"" Foroughi told Business Insider in an interview.

Then came April.

Ahead of a June 19 deadline, AppLovin and Foroughi, 45, made a last-minute bid to acquire the international assets of TikTok as the Chinese-owned company faces a potential ban in the US.

It's an audacious move for any company, let alone one with a founder who usually goes out of his way to avoid the spotlight.

It faces an uphill battle. Competition is fierce. President Donald Trump has said he's been negotiating with multiple potential buyers. Investors like Kevin O'Leary of ""Shark Tank"" fame and former Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have signaled interest, and other tech companies are in the mix.

At AppLovin, Foroughi is known for running a ruthlessly efficient ship that drives hard for profit. It's not unusual for the company to reduce head count even when it's doing well. Foroughi executes with a hands-on management style that has, at times, seen him struggle to delegate to execs who don't fit the mold. And the company's recent financial success has also caught the attention of short sellers who have raised questions about its data practices.

With TikTok, Foroughi would be taking on an organization with a much bigger spotlight — and the heat that comes from running a user-generated content business popular among teens and often lambasted by parents.

Most of the former AppLovin employees, competitors, and business associates who spoke with BI believe he's up to the task. They say Foroughi's smarts, as well as his tendency to forgo the marketing jazz hands and let the product do the talking, position him well to crank up the dial for TikTok's ad business.

""We've been competing for over a decade, and I've never seen anyone like him — he's all around amazing, it hurts me to say it,"" said an executive at one of AppLovin's competitors. ""He's the most talented CEO I have ever seen.""

Foroughi acknowledged that the TikTok bid is uncharted territory for him, but ""I don't really care about 'uncomfortable,'"" he said. ""I do what I think is right for my business.""

Foroughi and his family fled Iran when he was four years old, in the fallout of the Iranian Revolution.

They settled in Laguna Beach, California. His father, once one of Iran's leading real estate developers, left nearly all his wealth behind, and the family had to adjust to a more frugal lifestyle, a new culture, and a different language.

""My parents had to give up a lot to get us over here,"" Foroughi said. ""Knowing that, you always have this motivation inside you to perform.""

After graduating with a degree in finance from the University of California, Berkeley, Foroughi took a job as a derivatives trader. He found it a lonely existence. He wanted to build something of his own, and he wanted to work with people.

He worked at a marketing agency for small businesses, which later morphed into a social media marketing company. Eventually, as the app stores of Apple and Google became dominant, he looked to apps.

With a small team of engineers in Palo Alto, Foroughi created a fashion app, then a dating app.

""They stunk,"" Foroughi said. ""We got rid of them.""

In 2012, they launched their third attempt — an app that allowed friends to connect and send recommendations for other apps to download. This one stuck. If you were playing ""Words with Friends,"" the app could send a push notification to your contacts, asking them to join. AppLovin was born.

Like many tech companies, AppLovin — which Foroughi insists wasn't inspired by McLovin, the nerdy character in the stoner film ""Superbad"" — decided to pivot to advertising. It expanded from a ground-floor garage to offices on three continents, and more than 1,500 employees as of December 2024, and a market capitalization of $140 billion at the time of publication.

The business model is fairly simple: It helps app developers make money and find users using in-app ads. But under the surface is a highly optimized AI-powered algorithm designed to entice businesses with the promise that chucking $1 into the machine will net $2, $5, or $10 in profit.

It's a snug fit for TikTok, where ads for figure-hugging jeans, grip socks for soccer, and campaigns for major brands like Coca-Cola and Apple are slotted between consumable vertical videos. While TikTok has soared in popularity, particularly among Gen Z, its ad revenue lags behind Google, Meta, and Amazon. AppLovin thinks its adtech can help close the gap.

AppLovin has also widened its aperture beyond its core gaming roots in recent months. After it opened up its ad platform to e-commerce advertisers, some said that they were excited for an alternative to Meta, which had become increasingly expensive in their hunt for new customers. Mike True, CEO of the e-commerce marketing platform Prescient AI, said AppLovin is the fourth most invested-in channel among its advertiser clients, behind Meta, Google, and Amazon Ads.

""The fact that advertisers continue to invest in AppLovin, even amid a cautious market, suggests growing confidence in its long-term role within the performance stack,"" True said.

Last year, the company posted net income of $1.58 billion at 34% margins — a margin profile almost on a par with Meta, and ahead of its closest adtech rival, The Trade Desk, which had a profit margin of 16% in 2024. AppLovin's annual revenue rose 43% to $4.7 billion.

But some observers said that while AppLovin helped e-commerce advertisers extract more sales from current customers, it was less effective in driving sales from new ones. Jones Road Beauty was one of AppLovin's early e-commerce clients, but its CEO, Cody Plofker, told BI it's no longer using AppLovin.

""We found it not to be very incremental with new customers,"" Plofker said.

Foroughi said that the e-commerce product is still in its infancy and doesn't yet work for everyone.

""But it will as we build it out,"" he added.

One Silicon Valley tech veteran who interacted with AppLovin in the early years said taking meetings with Foroughi was a ""breath of fresh air."" He cut to the chase, no two-martini lunches necessary.

""We got on calls and he'd be very to the point, versus the mindset where relationships precede business — a very Valley kind of guy,"" the person said.

Simon Spaull was AppLovin's first hire in Europe in 2014. He reluctantly entertained the idea at first.

""No one had heard of it and it was a rubbish name,"" Spaull said.

He was soon convinced. Spaull stayed at the company for almost seven years, as it continuously posted record annual revenue, mostly growing traction through word of mouth in the gaming community.

Foroughi has remained deeply enmeshed with day-to-day operations, including customer service. Up until around a year ago, he ran product and human resources alongside his CEO role. (He said he wanted to ""get more involved in making sure our culture is aligned with the principles we had when we started the business."") When he's not traveling, he sits among the engineers.

""You don't know what's going on in your business if you don't work with your employees,"" Foroughi said.

Foroughi has said some of the biggest mistakes he made as CEO involved taking outside advice, including briefly hiring a chief operating officer in 2012.

""I thought, what's the point of me at this company, I'm hands-on, I'm not going to defer to this hire,"" Foroughi said at a recent conference held by the investment bank Jefferies.

He had a similar reaction after following advice to bring on a chief revenue officer and a brand ad sales team, with staffers who were paid more than the company's best engineer, the person making the actual product.

""It bugged the crap out of me,"" Foroughi said. He scrapped the entire team.

The company's strategy has been defined in part by unrelenting efficiency. Foroughi, who said he considers Elon Musk as an inspiration, counts EBITDA — or profit — per employee as one of his most important success metrics.

The company recently sold off its entire mobile gaming studio business — developers of hit games like ""Mobile Strike"" and ""Project Makeover"" — deeming it surplus after the apps had been sucked for data to use for its advertising algorithms.

Foroughi also showed a cut-throat streak in 2022, when the gaming software development company Unity announced its intention to acquire AppLovin's app advertising rival, IronSource. Seeking to derail the merger, AppLovin put in an unsolicited $20 billion bid to merge with Unity, but only on the provision that Unity drop the IronSource deal. Rather than make his offer to Unity's management team and the board, Foroughi went public to appeal directly to Unity's main shareholders: the investment firms Sequoia and Silver Lake.

Unity's management team wasn't happy, and they rejected the hostile takeover bid.

Foroughi has no regrets.

""The only way to disrupt that deal"" was for AppLovin to make its takeover offer public, Foroughi said. ""Yes, it was a little uncomfortable, obviously.""

Those within Foroughi's orbit say the billionaire has a generous side.

A banker who worked on AppLovin's 2021 initial public offering recalled receiving an updated draft of the registration statement and noticing that Foroughi had recently sold off around $10 million of stock, at a low price, pre-IPO. He asked Foroughi why.

""He's like, 'Uh, I'm surprised you found that. Yes, I sold some stock back to the company to distribute it to the team that was under-equitized,"" the person said.

The TikTok suitor is no stranger to US-China tensions. In 2016, Foroughi signed a deal with a Chinese private-equity firm that valued AppLovin at $1.4 billion, and would provide a $1 billion cash injection. The deal was blocked by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States on national security grounds.

""CFIUS saved my ass,"" Foroughi said at the Jefferies Private Growth Conference earlier this year, referring to AppLovin's financial performance since.

The company's methods have been called into question in recent months with four short-seller reports, published in quick succession.

The most high-profile, from Carson Block's Muddy Waters Research, said AppLovin was ""impermissibly extracting"" data from top apps like Meta, Google, and TikTok, and targeting ads at ""high value users"" without their consent. The report also said AppLovin was using underhanded techniques to claim credit for sales it didn't generate.

In an email to BI, Block said that Muddy Waters believed Foroughi ""lied"" in a March blog post, when he pushed back on the idea that the company ""uses persistent user identifiers without their consent."" Persistent identifiers follow users across different websites and devices, and it can be difficult for users to delete them or even know they exist. Muddy Waters said AppLovin's use of these IDs violates various platforms' terms of service and privacy laws in some jurisdictions.

Block also said that Foroughi's background pre-AppLovin ""supports our opinion that he should not be trusted."" He was referring to Foroughi's tenure at a company called Claria, which owned a controversial eWallet software called Gator, that was said at the time to have distributed ""adware"" that collected users' browsing habits, and bombarded them with pop-up ads. One of Foroughi's early ad networks, SocialHour, was removed from Facebook in 2009 for violating its platform policies.

Foroughi has previously said in blog posts that the short-seller reports were ""littered with inaccuracies and false assertions"" and were aimed at driving down AppLovin's share price for their own financial gain. He told BI that he worked at Claria for a few months as a 25-year-old. In response to questions about SocialHour, he said all companies that monetized Facebook's inventory were removed when Facebook brought monetization in-house.

Some industry insiders saw the reports as confirmation of their bafflement at AppLovin's success, particularly in light of its reliance on mobile games, which are not always highly valued by big brands and agencies.

AppLovin has proposed merging its company with all of TikTok's international business — not just TikTok US. Foroughi describes this as an ""enhancement"" to Oracle, which is TikTok's cloud provider in the US. Under AppLovin's proposal, Oracle would still provide data storage and security. Oracle didn't respond to requests for comment.

AppLovin has also pitched itself as a salve for TikTok's woes.

""There are really big national security and data issues, and I think we could solve them,"" Foroughi told BI.

AppLovin says it has expertise in both handling user data and controlling complex algorithms, which it believes could help it remove biases from TikTok's content recommendation system.

""I see what folks in the administration are doing now, what someone like Elon has sacrificed to give back to the country, and I think we could play a small part here,"" Foroughi said in an interview that took place before Musk and Trump's spectacular falling out this week.

TikTok didn't respond to a request for comment.

Ari Paparo, a former Googler and adtech exec who now runs the marketing media company Marketecture, said AppLovin has some big advantages in its TikTok bid: Its monster market capitalization makes the financial side feasible, it has proven monetization capabilities that could make ads on TikTok better, and it isn't ""Big Tech,"" which has drawn antitrust scrutiny.

On the other hand, he said, ""The company is a bit of an unknown in DC.""

That may soon change. In April, Foroughi was spotted at the launch party of Donald Trump Jr.'s private members club.

""​​I'm reclusive by design, so part of the challenge has been that I have to get out there, and get to be known, and I just wasn't before this,"" Foroughi said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Trump Is Considering Selling His Tesla After Feuding With Elon Musk","https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-considering-selling-tesla-feud-elon-musk-model-s-2025-6","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 14:56:00 GMT","

Just under three months ago, President Donald Trump stood next to Elon Musk outside the White House to choose a new Tesla. Following his explosive feud with the Tesla CEO, Trump may be about to ditch his shiny EV too.

A senior White House official confirmed to Business Insider that Trump was considering selling or giving away the red Model S, which has a list price of about $80,000. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news.

Trump picked out the Model S from a lineup of Tesla vehicles during a sales pitch-like event with Musk at the White House in March.

At the time, it was a show of support from Trump to his biggest financial backer, with Tesla stock plunging and the company becoming a target for protests due to Musk's efforts to slash the government workforce at DOGE.

At the event, Trump said he was buying a Tesla because ""it's a great product, as good as it gets,"" and because Musk had ""devoted his energy and his life to doing this, and I think he's been treated very unfairly by a very small group of people.""

Since then, the relationship between the president and the world's richest person has taken a dramatic turn for the worst.

A high-profile spat began on Thursday with Musk criticising Trump's ""big, beautiful"" tax bill in a series of posts on X. Trump then called the billionaire ""crazy"" and suggested that ""the easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts.""

The feud damaged Tesla's stock price, closing down 14% on Thursday and wiping $138 billion off the company's valuation. Shares staged a recovery on Friday, rising nearly 5% in morning trading and remain down by a fifth this year.

If Trump does decide to sell his Model S, he should probably get a move on. A study by used car site iSeeCars in April found that used Model S prices had dropped more than any other model over the past year, as the resale value of used Teslas continues to slide.

Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

For some, watching Donald Trump and Elon Musk fall out is like watching your favorite power couple break up — and Bill Ackman and Ye really don't want that happening.

The billionaire hedge fund manager and the hip-hop mogul took to X to share their thoughts.

Ackman urged Trump and Musk to reconcile and continue working together.

""I support @realDonaldTrump and @elonmusk and they should make peace for the benefit of our great country. We are much stronger together than apart,"" Ackman wrote in his post, which is now pinned to the top of his X profile.

I support @realDonaldTrump and @elonmusk and they should make peace for the benefit of our great country. We are much stronger together than apart.

Musk responded to Ackman's post. ""You're not wrong,"" the Tesla CEO wrote.

You're not wrong

Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, took a different approach.

""Broooos please noooooo. We love you both so much,"" Ye wrote on X, with an emoji of two people hugging.

Broooos please noooooo 🫂 We love you both so much

Musk and Trump's relationship has taken a sharp turn. 

Shortly after Trump was wounded in an assassination attempt at a rally in July, Musk took to X to declare his endorsement of Trump's presidential bid. He later stood by Trump's side at Mar-a-Lago on election night, celebrating his victory.

In November, Trump said Musk would help lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, which was tasked with cutting federal spending.

Early in Trump's second term, Musk was a regular fixture at the White House. At one point, the Tesla CEO brought his son, X Æ A-XII, to the Oval Office.

But in May, Musk began distancing himself from the administration.

Then on Thursday, it all came crashing down: Musk and Trump had a very public falling out, trading barbs on their respective social media platforms.

Musk, who left his role at DOGE last week, took to X to criticize Trump's tax bill in a flurry of posts, branding it the ""Big Ugly Spending Bill.""

Trump then fired back during a White House event, expressing his disappointment in Musk and dismissing the criticism as a case of ""Trump Derangement Syndrome,"" before turning to Truth Social to defend his tax bill.

Representatives for Ackman and Ye did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider outside regular hours.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","How the nasty feud between Trump and Musk unfolded minute by minute","https://www.businessinsider.com/a-timeline-of-how-elon-musks-relationship-with-trump-imploded-2025-6","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 01:28:00 GMT","

Twenty-five minutes of live TV, more than a dozen posts on X, and three posts on Truth Social over the period of five hours (and counting) — that's how the already fractured friendship of Elon Musk and President Donald Trump publicly unraveled on Thursday.

The first signs of trouble began when Musk showed opposition to Trump's spending bill, the ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" though he never explicitly targeted Trump.

""Shame on those who voted for it,"" Musk tweeted on Tuesday, referring to Congress members who voted for Trump's tax cut bill.

Trump, for his part, had stayed uncharacteristically mum about Musk's criticism of the bill.

But that all changed on Thursday morning.

Here is a minute-by-minute breakdown of how the relationship between two of the most powerful men on the planet devolved.

Musk began digging up Trump's old posts on what was then Twitter about the deficit, including one from January of 2013.

Wise words https://t.co/6juH1jEjtc

Musk unearthed another old X post by Trump from back in July 2012, presumably as a swipe at the new Republican tax bill that many economists and the congressional Budget Office said would increase the country's deficits.

I couldn't agree more! 🇺🇸🇺🇸 https://t.co/sZ6xgisZEA

Trump responded to Musk's attacks for the first time when answering press questions during a White House event to welcome German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

""And you know Elon's upset because we took the EV mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles,"" said Trump. ""And they're having a hard time, the electric vehicles. And they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy. Elon knew this from the beginning; he knew it from a long time ago.""

Trump's comments about Musk continued at the press appearance.

""He knew every aspect of this bill — better than almost anybody —and he never had a problem until right after he left,"" said Trump. ""He said the most beautiful things about me. He hasn't said bad things about me personally, but I'm sure that'll be next. But I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot.""

""People leave my administration, and they love us, and then at some point they miss it so badly, and some of them embrace it, and some of them actually become hostile,"" Trump continued.

""I don't know what it is. It's sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it, but we have it with others, too. They leave and they wake up in the morning, and the glamour's gone. The whole world is different, and they become hostile,"" he added.

Musk began a whirlwind of tweets soon after, responding in near real time to what Trump said during the press appearance.

""False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!"" Musk posed on X.

False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it! https://t.co/V4ztekqd4g

Musk then began a series of tweets directed at the president beyond the bill, including saying that without him, Republicans would have lost.

Such ingratitude

Musk polls his X followers about creating a new political party ""that actually represents the 80% in the middle."" Mark Cuban quoted the post with three checkmarks.

Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?

Musk gives Trump's bill — known on paper as the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" — a new name: ""Big Ugly Spending Bill.""

Not even those in Congress who had to vote on the Big Ugly Spending Bill had time to read it! https://t.co/mBOQyhQYwX

Trump responds to Musk with two consecutive posts on his own social media platform, Truth Social.

""Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!"" Trump wrote.

""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!"" the president continued.

Musk responds to Trump's posts on Truth Social, calling them ""such an obvious lie.""

Such an obvious lie. So sad. https://t.co/sOu9vqMVfX

A minute later, Musk appeared to dare Trump to cancel government contracts with his companies.

This just gets better and better 🤣🤣Go ahead, make my day … https://t.co/APmy7cV8iL

Musk makes another accusation.

Time to drop the really big bomb:@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.Have a nice day, DJT!

Trump posts on Truth Social again to defend his tax bill.

""I don't mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress,"" Trump wrote.

""It's a Record Cut in Expenses, $1.6 Trillion Dollars, and the Biggest Tax Cut ever given. If this Bill doesn't pass, there will be a 68% Tax Increase, and things far worse than that. I didn't create this mess, I'm just here to FIX IT,"" Trump added.

Musk says SpaceX will decommission its Dragon spacecraft ""immediately.""

SpaceX's Dragon spaceships transport NASA astronauts and supplies to and from the International Space Station. Prior to partnering with SpaceX, the agency depended on Russian Soyuz spacecraft for crewed missions.

In light of the President's statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately pic.twitter.com/NG9sijjkgW

Musk says that Trump's tariffs will ""cause a recession in the second half of this year.""

Some economists have also predicted that Trump's tariffs would hurt the economy, and Trump himself declined to rule out the chances of a recession back in March.

JPMorgan had predicted a 60% chance of a US recession after Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on April 2. The bank adjusted the possibility down to below 50% recently after Trump paused most of his highest tariffs.

The Trump tariffs will cause a recession in the second half of this year https://t.co/rbBC11iynE

Musk retweeted what appears to be a video of Trump partying with Epstein from the 1990s, doubling down on his earlier statement about the Epstein files.

🤨 https://t.co/DTdfJWydLS

""This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Business Insider in a statement. ""The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again.""

Representatives for Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

Musk took a softer tone later on Thursday night.

Some five hours after his post about decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft, he walked back the decision in a response to an X user.

""This is a shame this back and forth. You are both better than this. Cool off and take a step back for a couple days,"" X user Fab25june wrote on the platform.

""Good advice. Ok, we won't decommission Dragon,"" Musk wrote at 9:20 p.m.

In a separate exchange on X, billionaire investor Bill Ackman encouraged Musk and Trump to make up.

""I support @realDonaldTrump and @elonmusk and they should make peace for the benefit of our great country. We are much stronger together than apart,"" Ackman wrote.

""You're not wrong,"" Musk responded at 9:27 p.m.

President Donald Trump is holding back from pushing China to halt support for Russia's war machine as he focuses on other issues in the relationship with its biggest geopolitical rival, according to US and European officials familiar with the matter.

The US administration will hone in on bilateral concerns with Beijing as it pushes the conflict in Ukraine further down the list of American foreign policy priorities, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. Some cautioned that Trump could still change his stance at any time. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

UBS Group AG said it would examine steps to mitigate the effects of the Swiss government's proposal for as much as $26 billion in fresh capital requirements, calling the demand “extreme” and vowing to continue its push to dilute the regulations.

After months of uncertainty that's weighed on the Zurich-based bank's share price, the Swiss Federal Council said Friday that it would require UBS to back the capital in its foreign subsidiaries fully at the parent bank. The government estimates that this will force UBS to add as much as $23 billion in capital to its Swiss-based main unit, with the remainder coming from other measures.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The politics of the world's richest man have proved toxic for the EV maker, but what comes next may be far worse.

All done?

After the world's least surprising blowup, we the people are reportedly to be treated to its least convincing truce. Investors in Tesla Inc., nominally run by Elon Musk, the chief-buddy-turned-chief-critic of President Donald Trump, are apparently relieved. The stock bounced in trading Friday after Thursday's epic slide took Tesla's value back below $1 trillion.

 There are relief rallies and there are delusion rallies. This one bears a striking resemblance to the latter. Tesla's valuation, largely an extension of Musk himself, has lately also become an extension of his relationship with Trump — which he has now trashed. Regardless of any bromides on Friday, the bust-up has laid bare the enumerable risks to which Tesla is exposed by Musk's politicking. And all this on the eve of its robotaxi launch, now relegated to a side show.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

When Elon Musk and Donald Trump joined forces during the presidential campaign, there was always a question over how long their alliance would last and who would prevail if it didn't work out.

After the public spat between the world's richest man and its most-powerful leader spun out of control on Thursday, the answer was clear: It was Musk who eventually backed down when Tesla Inc.'s stock price tanked and his net worth crumbled by $34 billion. The damage to Musk's business empire will be difficult to repair — with Tesla's stock up only about 4% soon after the market's open, recouping just some of its previous day's slide.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Nuclear Energy Revival:

The Turkey Point nuclear power plant, which sits between Biscayne Bay and the Everglades, generates enough electricity for 1 million homes and businesses in South Florida. 

A plume of super-salty water is seeping out of the aging Turkey Point plant and into a critical aquifer. A race is on to contain it.

A few miles from where American crocodiles swim by the hundreds in the cooling canals of the Turkey Point nuclear power plant, engineers are fighting an invisible threat to Miami's drinking water.

The hulking plant, which provides power to run air conditioners and appliances for 1 million homes and businesses, sits about 25 miles south of Miami, in the middle of paradise. A few feet to its east are the azure waters of Biscayne Bay. The lush islands of the Florida Keys beckon to the south. To the west are the vast and vital Florida Everglades.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Temperatures are soaring, so naturally Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is getting rid of all the experts who have been devising on-the-job protections.

Heat-exposed workers will be even more at risk when a changing climate is driving temperatures higher.

We're on the verge of what will probably be one of the hottest Northern Hemisphere summers in human history. In early May, the water in the English Channel was already so hot that octopuses invaded it, inspiring Bloomberg News' Joe Wertz to dub this “hot octopus summer,” and not in a fun, Megan Thee Stallion way. 

Soaring temperatures, which are deadlier than any other natural disaster, will endanger the health and productivity of millions of Americans this summer. Workers at construction sites, farms and factories, along with delivery workers and many others in heat-exposed jobs, are especially at risk. So naturally, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is somehow in charge of managing our nation's health, has reportedly fired all of the people who have been helping the federal government write heat protections for workers. This will likely make extreme heat even riskier and the economic impact even heavier.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Quiet cuts to incentives are boosting how much Americans pay for cars, even if the sticker price stays the same.

The financing deals offered US car buyers are less generous than just a few months ago, adding to monthly payments.

Photographer: Arin Yoon/Bloomberg 

Car buyers racing to get ahead of President Donald Trump's tariffs face an uncomfortable truth — the trade war is already boosting US auto prices, often in ways nearly invisible to consumers. 

The sticker price on a particular make and model may not have changed, at least not yet. But automakers have been quietly cutting rebates and limiting cheap financing deals, adding hundreds of dollars to buyers' monthly payments even as the companies say they're holding the line on pricing. Several have boosted delivery charges — a fee everyone must pay when buying a new vehicle — by $40 to $400 dollars, according to automotive researcher Edmunds.com Inc.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

President Donald Trump is ""not interested"" in a call with Tesla CEO Elon Musk to resolve their feud, a senior White House official told NBC News on Friday morning.

The two billionaires launched a war of words on Thursday over Musk's continued criticism of Trump's proposed tax bill, which is pending in the Senate.

Trump said Musk, who until a week ago was one of his top government advisors, had gone ""crazy"" and threatened to kill federal contracts with his companies, which include SpaceX.

Musk, in turn, said Trump could not have been elected president without his massive financial support, and accused the Republican of ingratitude for that, and for lying in saying that he had ousted Musk from the White House because the CEO was ""wearing thin.""

Musk also said SpaceX would decommission its Dragon spacecraft, the only current U.S. method of transporting crew to and from the International Space Station. Musk later said Dragon would not be decommissioned.

""No. I won't be speaking to him for a while I guess, but I wish him well,"" Trump told CNN, that outlet reported Friday morning.

 ""I'm not even thinking about Elon. He's got a problem. The poor guy's got a problem,"" Trump said.

Trump's chief of staff, Susie Wiles, separately told NBC News that ""there are no plans for that today,"" when asked about a report by Politico that White House aides ""scheduled a call Friday with the billionaire CEO of Tesla to broker a peace.""

But an administration official told NBC, ""There could be anything — I'd like to de-escalate a very unfortunate situation.""

""There are no calls on the books, at least not now,"" the official said.

The Federal Reserve's new top regulatory official laid out an ambitious agenda for revisiting and easing numerous bank rules and oversight policies which she argued have become onerous and unnecessary.

Michelle Bowman, who was confirmed to be the Fed's Vice Chair for Supervision on Wednesday, said the Fed will be reconsidering how it writes rules and polices some of the nation's largest and most complex banks. In prepared remarks, she argued that the influx of rules since the 2008 financial crisis merits reconsideration.

""Our goal should not be to prevent banks from failing or even eliminate the risk that they will. Our goal should be to make banks safe to fail, meaning that they can be allowed to fail without threatening to destabilize the rest of the banking system,"" she said.

Bowman, who has served as a Fed governor since 2018, has long been critical of efforts to impose stricter rules on the banking sector. In her first remarks since being confirmed to the Fed's top regulatory post, she said the Fed will soon launch numerous projects aimed at easing requirements and streamlining oversight, including in many areas that have been longtime targets for complaints by banks.

Among those initiatives will be changes to how the Fed supervises large banks, plans to make some bank rules less restrictive, and a consideration of changes that could ease the bank merger process.

LONDON — The U.K. is set to lift a ban on a key type of crypto debt security in a bid to catch up to the U.S. and other financial hubs as it looks to become a global hub for digital assets.

On Friday, the Financial Conduct Authority, the U.K.'s main regulator for financial services, announced a proposal to reverse its ban on offering crypto exchange-traded notes to retail investors.

Exchange-traded notes are a type of debt instrument that are linked to one or more specified assets — cryptocurrencies, in this case. In essence, they allow investors to gain exposure to digital tokens through the use of a regulated exchange.

Sales of crypto ETNs to retail investors have been prohibited in the U.K. since the FCA put in place a ban in 2019 due to concerns over the potential harms they pose to consumers.

On Friday, however, the FCA said it proposed lifting the ban on crypto ETNs ""to support UK growth and competitiveness."" A restriction on crypto derivatives will remain in place, the watchdog added.

""This consultation demonstrates our commitment to supporting the growth and competitiveness of the UK's crypto industry,"" David Geale, executive director of payments and digital assets at the FCA, said in a statement.

""We want to rebalance our approach to risk and lifting the ban would allow people to make the choice on whether such a high-risk investment is right for them, given they could lose all their money.""

The development was swiftly praised by crypto firms as a significant moment for the industry in the U.K. Britain is often perceived as falling behind the U.S., European Union and other global players when it comes to digital assets.

Spot crypto exchange-traded funds have been available in the U.S. since the Securities and Exchange Commission approved rule changes to allow the creation of the first bitcoin-linked ETFs early last year.

In April, the U.K. government published draft legislation for the crypto sector with the goal of making the country a ""world leader in digital assets."" The FCA is separately working through a detailed roadmap of consultations and discussion papers with a view to implement a regulatory regime for crypto by 2026.

""Until now, the UK has been an outlier on ETNs. We hope this move will improve consumer protections and we will continue to make the case for lifting the ban on retail investors from accessing highly-regulated derivative products,"" said Ian Taylor, board advisor to crypto trade body CryptoUK.

Kraken's U.K. General Manager Bivu Das said that the proposal to approve sales of crypto ETNs to consumers marked a ""major milestone for the UK's crypto ecosystem.""

The FCA is ""acknowledging that the market has matured significantly and that outdated restrictions no longer serve their intended purpose,"" Das added. ""Regulatory moves like this are critical if the UK is to stay competitive in the race to lead in digital assets.""

The bromance is over.

An extraordinary social media feud between U.S. President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk Thursday showcased the public fracturing of their once-close relationship.

Here's a rundown of how Trump and Musk got here:

Musk publicly endorses Trump following an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.

Musk posts on social media platform X: ""I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.""

In August, Musk held a conversation with Trump on X. The glitchy livestream got off to an inauspicious start, with technical difficulties delaying the event for almost an hour.

Trump and Musk congratulated each other in a wide-ranging chat, covering topics such as then-Vice President Kamala Harris, how Trump handled the assassination attempt and climate change.

Musk later suggests he's ""willing to serve"" in government. The Tesla CEO posted an image of himself on X as a representative of DOGE, an acronym for the Department of Government Efficiency.

In early October, Musk appears at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania, where Trump survived the earlier assassination attempt.

Wearing a cap with the ""Make America Great Again"" slogan of the Trump campaign, Musk said Trump was the only candidate ""to preserve democracy in America.""

Public displays of alignment continue, reinforcing Musk's growing proximity to Trump's political comeback.

After Trump's re-election, Musk is appointed to lead DOGE alongside former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. The department is formed via executive order with a mission to slash federal spending and bureaucracy.

""Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,"" Trump said in a statement at the time. 

Ramaswamy would later leave his role as co-lead of DOGE to pursue elected office.

Maye Musk, Elon's mother, later comments that the two ""just seem to be having fun.""

Two weeks after his election victory, Trump attended a SpaceX ""Starship"" rocket launch in Texas alongside Musk.

At Trump's inauguration, Musk receives lavish praise from the president: ""We have a new star. A star is born. Elon!""

Musk joins Trump's CEO calls, alongside leaders from Amazon, Google, Meta, and others.

Musk begins overseeing aggressive cost-cutting at government agencies. DOGE forces through return-to-office mandates and eliminates some remote-first government programs.

Musk's DOGE team faces backlash after overreaching into agencies like the U.S. Institute of Peace.

In early March, Trump tells members of the Cabinet that they are in charge of the respective agencies and departments they oversee — not Musk. The tech mogul later posts on X that the meeting was ""very productive.""

Trump turns the White House lawn into a Tesla showroom and defends Musk as the electric vehicle maker incurs a global backlash.

""He's built this great company, and he shouldn't be penalized because he's a patriot,"" Trump said at the time.

The president also described the cars as ""beautiful"" and said he would buy one.

Musk pledges to ""significantly"" reduce his involvement in DOGE over the coming weeks.

Reports emerge of Musk being distracted and over-stretched, fueling concerns among Tesla and SpaceX investors.

At the time of Tesla's first-quarter earnings in April — which missed expectations — the EV maker's shares were down more than 40% over the year so far.

In an interview with CBS News, Musk publicly criticizes Trump's signature tax and spending bill, saying it counters the work he's been doing to reduce wasteful government spending.

""I was, like, disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decrease it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,"" he said.

Trump responded to the critique by saying he wasn't happy with certain aspects of the bill, ""but I'm thrilled by other aspects of it. That's the way they go.""

One day after airing his criticism of Trump's bill, Musk leaves the White House. He thanks the president for the opportunity to run DOGE.

Trump holds a farewell event for Musk, commending his work in government but says he is ""not really leaving"" and will occasionally return to the White House because DOGE is his ""baby.""

Musk lashes out further at Trump's spending bill, calling it a ""disgusting abomination"" that will explode federal budget deficits. ""Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it,"" Musk said on X.

The criticism quickly escalates into an all-out online brawl between Trump and Musk, with the pair trading barbs over the course of several hours.

The U.S. president threatened to pull back billions of dollars in government contracts for Musk's companies, while the Tesla CEO suggested Trump could not have won the election without him.

""Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore,"" Trump said.

Developments from the White House are growing more exciting and unpredictable than those 1,000-episode Asian drama serials.

On Thursday, ""So much for being Mr. NICE GUY"" Donald Trump reverted to being a nice guy and had a ""very good call,"" in his words, with Chinese president Xi Jinping over trade issues. Following the call, Trump said that officials from both countries will meet to negotiate further. Trump had previously described the process of reaching an agreement with Xi as ""extremely hard,"" while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that talks between the U.S. and China are ""a bit stalled,"" which makes the positive outcome of the call even more of a breakthrough.

But Trump's no longer playing nice with Elon Musk. Just last Friday, the U.S. president at a farewell ceremony to Musk's role at DOGE called the latter ""terrific"" and said ""he will, always, be with us."" Starting from the weekend, however, Musk began blasting Trump's ""big, beautiful bill,"" which on Thursday culminated in a public spat between the former compatriots in the White House. Trump acknowledged Thursday that ""Elon and I had a great relationship"" — note the use of the past tense — but he doesn't know ""if we will anymore.""  

Unlike the twists and turns of a television series, however, the White House's relationships with others — a drama equally or more entertaining than fiction to some — have concrete effects on the economy and markets. Tesla's shares, for instance, tanked 14% after its CEO feuded with the U.S. President. A viewer cannot be completely absorbed, lest, in losing themselves in the spectacle, they lose their investments as well.

Ugly spat between Trump and Musk U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday called Tesla CEO Elon Musk ""CRAZY"" and threatened to cut his companies' government contracts as the two men feuded over a major tax bill. In response, Musk said Space X will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft ""immediately."" ""Without me, Trump would have lost the election,"" Musk added later. Shares of Tesla sank more than 14% and shed $152 billion in value from the electric vehicle maker.

Trump talks to Xi on tradeTrump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Thursday had a ""very good call"" for about 90 minutes which focused ""almost entirely"" on trade, Trump wrote on Truth Social. He added that U.S. and China officials will meet soon for more talks to resolve an ongoing trade war. Beijing's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and China's embassy in the U.S. said earlier Thursday that Trump had requested the call with Xi.

U.S. markets dragged down by TeslaU.S. stocks fell Thursday, weighed down by Tesla shares tanking. The S&P 500 retreated 0.53%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.25% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.83%. But Microsoft's stocks climbed 0.8% to hit a record and reclaim the title of the world's largest company by market capitalization. Asia-Pacific markets were mixed Friday. India's Nifty 50 was up by 0.95% at 1:45 p.m. in Singapore after the country's central bank slashed interest rates. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, however, slipped 0.4%.

India's central bank delivers outsized cutThe Reserve Bank of India lowered its benchmark policy rate to 5.5% from 6%, the lowest level since August 2022. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the bank to reduce rates by 25 basis points. The decision comes India reported better-than-expected gross domestic product growth in its fiscal fourth quarter. However, the RBI held its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, marking a sharp slowdown from the 9.2% seen in the previous financial year.

Circle shares pop after IPOShares of Circle Internet Group soared 168% on Thursday after the stablecoin company and its selling shareholders raised almost $1.1 billion in an initial public offering. The stock opened at $69 on the New York Stock Exchange after its IPO priced at $31. At one point, shares traded as high as $103.75. Circle joins Coinbase, Mara Holdings and Riot Platforms as one of the few pure-play crypto companies to list in America.

[PRO] Tariffs might benefit LSEThe London Stock Exchange has struggled to entice companies looking to go public — but some market watchers say a tariffs-driven diversification away from the U.S. could help the U.K. win back a greater share of the IPO market.

Trump and Musk feud draws reactions from billionaires, politicians and pundits. Here's who said what

Trump and Musk seemed inseparable not so long ago: attending events together, doing joint interviews and showering praises on each other. All that changed overnight.

Billionaire Bill Ackman on Thursday urged Trump and Musk to stop fighting. The two men should ""make peace for the benefit of our great country,"" Ackman said on X.

Tesla bull Ross Gerber, head of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, had harsh words for Musk in a series of X posts, stating that Elon was ""now attacking all the people he helped put in power."" 

Others in Trump's orbit, such as former senior Trump advisor Steve Bannon, who has clashed with Musk in recent months, were also critical of Musk, saying that Trump should sign an executive order to take control of SpaceX.

Sweden's economy and households are feeling the heat from U.S. trade tariffs, the Scandinavian country's finance minister told CNBC — before the full force of the levies has even come into play.

""Our economy and the public finance are very solid. We have a low debt and we can cope with quite a lot. But eight of 10 Swedes save or invest their money in funds, stock markets and so on. So when ... the market has gone up and down, that has been costly for households,"" Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson told CNBC Tuesday.

""[U.S. President Donald] Trump is really playing a high stakes here, and it's a game with no winners, really, and it's costly for households, and that makes me sad,"" she added.

Uncertainty around the U.S.' trade policy has left its mark on Swedish and international financial markets. Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, noted last week that the sharp shifts in U.S. trade and security policy were causing ""substantial market movements during the spring and entail greater uncertainty than usual.""

Other signs have emerged that the threat of tariffs is affecting the wider Swedish economy, with government data released last week showing the economy shrank 0.2% in the three months to March, on a quarterly basis.

Sweden's finance ministry revised its 2025 and 2026 growth forecasts downwards last month, predicting a 1.8% expansion this year and 2.3% next year, saying tariffs and uncertainty are dampening the country's growth prospects.

""We don't know whether tariffs will end, but the uncertainty and the unpredictability — that hurts our economy,"" Svantesson told CNBC.

Market volatility is having a significant effect on savers in Sweden, a country renowned for its high level of household savings in investment funds among its 10.5 million population.

The nation has actively encouraged retail savings in capital markets for decades, enabling citizens to invest in shares and investment funds and making the practice far more commonplace than in other European countries, like the U.K.

Assessing the distribution and demographics of savers in Sweden, financial watchdog Finansinspektionen noted in March that savers on the younger and older ends of the spectrum tend to put their money into savings accounts. A larger portion of new savings for middle-aged Swedes is in shares and investment funds, ranging from pension schemes and fixed-income to sustainable and technology-focused funds.

Swedish households held liquid financial savings — assets in bank accounts, funds, shares or other savings that generate a cash return — totaling 268 billion Swedish kronor ($27.8 billion) in 2024, with 138 billion Swedish kronor ($14.3 billion) held in investment funds, Sweden's statistics agency said in March, with the average Swede saving around 1,000 Swedish kronor every month in such funds last year.

At the end of the first quarter of 2025, the total fund assets in Swedish investment funds amounted to 7.75 trillion Swedish kronor, according to the latest data from Sweden's statistics body.

""Eight out of every ten Swedes save in funds, and if mandatory premium pension savings are included, we are all fund savers,"" the Swedish Investment Fund Association (Fondbolagens förening) — which aims to promote and protect confidence in funds as a savings format — says on its website, describing the country as a ""world leader in fund saving.""

Trump's announcement in April that he would impose import tariffs on a wide range of trading partners, friend and foe alike, has proven a major source of market and economic uncertainty, and it's making some Swedish fund savers nervous, the association told CNBC.

""Swedish fund savers are used to equity investments going up and down in the short run and have a long investment horizon,"" Fredrik Pettersson, chief analyst at Fondbolagens förening, told CNBC Wednesday.

""Having said that, in our statistics we can see that in the beginning of this year, until now, active fund savers have sold U.S. funds, and bought European and Swedish funds,"" he noted.

Morten Lund, Scandinavia chief economist at JPMorgan, told CNBC on Wednesday that Trump tariffs are "" having a pretty clear impact on household sentiment"" and that this could feed into the wider economy.

""So what we can see is that household confidence has moved around the U.S. election, from being the highest across the developed markets to now it's actually plummeted to being the lowest. So it's been a pretty significant shock, and I think it's fair to say that this is very much related to tariffs uncertainty,"" he said.

Low household confidence could filter through to consumption, Lund said, judging from the latest growth data.

""We do think that there will be a hit. We did get the first GDP numbers from the first quarter, they declined, and that was a clear disappointment, and based on where the confidence numbers are now, we should also see a pretty weak number here in the current quarter,"" Lund noted.

Sweden is an export-dependent country: exports amounted to around 55% of the national gross domestic product (GDP) in 2024, according to the country's central bank, making its wider economy vulnerable to tariffs imposed on the EU by President Trump.

The move — and tariffs on other trading partners — was predicated on what Trump sees as unfair trading practices by the bloc, which it denies, and persistent trade deficits that the U.S. runs with the EU.

Trump initially imposed 20% duties on the EU as part of his sweeping ""reciprocal tariffs"" announced in early April, before slashing the rate to 10% for 90 days on April 9 to give time for both sides to negotiate new trading terms.

The EU and U.S. have been locked in talks to try to reach a trade deal, but Trump said in late May that he was recommending a straight 50% duty on goods coming from the bloc amid stalling negotiations.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen managed to persuade the president to give talks more time but, as things stand, the EU has until July 9 to reach a deal with Washington.

Sweden's largest exports to the U.S. are autos, machinery, pharmaceuticals, paper products and iron, steel — which is now subject to a 50% U.S. import tariff — and iron ore. Most Swedish exports go to other Nordic or European countries, but the U.S. is the third largest single exporting country, the Riksbank notes.

""Of course, we are very dependent on exports,"" Sweden's finance minister told CNBC's ""Europe early Edition.""

""With this uncertainty, companies are holding back, waiting for investments, because they don't know what will happen. Will the tariff be 10 or 20%, or something else?"" she asked.

Here's who said what","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/06/trump-musk-feud-draws-reactions-from-billionaires-politicians-and-pundits.html","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 03:45:00 GMT","



Donald Trump and Elon Musk seemed inseparable not so long ago: attending events together, doing joint interviews and showering praises on each other. All that changed overnight.

Trump and Musk traded barbs in a rather public feud, with the U.S. president threatening to pull back billions of dollars in government contracts for Musk's companies, while the Tesla CEO suggested Trump could not have won the election without him.

The hostilities began when Trump lashed out at Musk's criticism of the Republican tax-cut and spending bill, and quickly escalated into an all-out online brawl on Trump's Truth Social and Musk's X, with prominent businessmen, analysts and political names weighing in on the fight. 

Billionaire Bill Ackman on Thursday urged Trump and Musk to stop fighting. The two men should ""make peace for the benefit of our country,"" Ackman said on X.

The founder and chief executive of hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, who had endorsed Trump a few months before the November election, said: ""We are much stronger together than apart,"" with Musk replying: ""You're not wrong.""

U.S. Congressman Jim Jordan told Fox News' Laura Ingraham on Thursday that he hoped Musk and Trump would reconcile, while defending the budget bill. 

Others in Trump's orbit, such as former senior Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who has clashed with Musk in recent months, were less conciliatory. 

Bannon said on his ""War Room Live"" show Thursday that Trump should sign an executive order to take control of SpaceX, through a national security mobilization law called the Defense Production Act. 

""The U.S. government should seize it,"" Bannon said, adding that the administration should strip Musk of his security clearance and suspend all federal contracts to his companies, pending an investigation into him. 

Congressman Thomas Massie, a Republican who has opposed Trump's budget bill and been critical of the president in the past, said on X, ""The falling out was inevitable. You don't land rockets backwards or get cars to drive themselves by suffering fools gladly.""

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban seemingly endorsed a proposal from Musk, who had polled followers on whether to ""create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle.""

Former Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang reposted Cuban, later pitching an ""Independent '28 presidential primary"" with participants including Mark Cuban, Jamie Dimon, and actor Matthew McConaughey. 

In Europe, Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski took aim at Musk over his feud with Trump. Sikorski became embroiled in a public spat with Musk and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in March when he said Ukraine may need an alternative to the Starlink satellite service. Amid a flurry of social media posts, Musk told Warsaw's top diplomat, ""Be quiet, small man.""

Referencing the previous dispute, Sikorski said in a post on X, ""See, big man, politics is harder than you thought.""

In an apparent reference to Trump and Musk's online spat, the European Union's former leader on tech Thierry Breton posted an eyes emoji and a popcorn emoji. Breton and Musk have previously clashed on social media.

Eurasia Group's Ian Bremmer said in a post on X that ""Trump is more powerful than elon, but far less competent.""

Wall Street traders dumped Tesla shares, sending them down over 14%, wiping out a staggering $152 billion in the EV maker's market value.

Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush said in a research note that the conflict was ""jaw dropping and a shock to the market,"" creating major fear for Tesla investors. 

""Tesla's stock is under major pressure down 15% as investors fear that this Musk/Trump battle will stop their friendship and change the regulatory environment for Tesla on the autonomous front over the coming years under the Trump Administration,"" Ives said. 

However, Ives added that the spat had not changed Wedbush's bullish view on Tesla, though it ""clearly does put a fly in the ointment of the Trump regulatory framework going forward."" 

Another Tesla bull, Ross Gerber, head of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, had harsh words for Musk in a series of X posts, stating that Elon was ""now attacking all the people he helped put in power."" 

""Elon going postal on Trump and tesla stock is getting walloped. Trump will be returning his new tesla and is saying he got musked. All this can't be good for shareholders. But hey, who cares about us,"" he said in a post. 

Gary Black, Future Fund's Managing Director, who recently said on X that this firm had sold all its Tesla shares, argued that Trump and Elon's feud would put further pressure on the stock, taking aim at Tesla bulls. 

""These same bulls argued for months that the Musk-Trump alliance would streamline the federal process allowing TSLA to secure general unsupervised autonomy license nationally. That prospect is now highly unlikely,"" he said in an X post. 

David Rosenberg, president and founder of Rosenberg Research believes Musk's SpaceX provides the U.S. a huge lead in space technology and the ongoing feud could thwart that.

""There's a small group of Republicans that are unsure about that for various reasons, and many of them have cited Elon Musk's opposition to that [spending] bill as a reason that they will not vote for it. So the politics of what Musk is doing may actually be the most significant part of that,"" Rosenberg told CNBC's Squawk Box.

This was CNBC's live blog covering European financial markets.

European stock markets rose after digesting news of the ECB rate cut and the upward revision of first-quarter eurozone GDP this week.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 rose 0.3%. France's CAC 40 was up 0.2%. Meanwhile, Germany's DAX fell 0.1%

Why are UBS shares rallying after the Swiss government proposed tough new capital rules?

JPMorgan analysts might also have the answer to that question.

""Today's outcome is positive for UBS, based on our initial view, although we need to go through the full set of documents, due to the long timeframe for implementation in our view,"" said JPMorgan's analyst Kian Abouhossein in a note to clients.

Shares of the bank jumped as much as 6% after Switzerland announced highly-anticipated capital regulations calling on UBS to hold an additional $26 billion in Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital.

However, the earliest that regulations will apply in full will be 2033. The law would be finalised by 2027 at the earliest, with six years given to implement the changes.

The Wall Street bank's analysts said that UBS is expected to generate around $12 billion [per annum] in profits with a dividend of about $3 billion, which means the bank can ""fulfill its 'capital gap' by 2033+ and still continue with buybacks.""

Why are UBS shares rallying after the Swiss government proposed tough new capital rules?

Shares of the bank jumped as much as 6% after Switzerland announced highly-anticipated capital regulations calling on UBS to hold an additional $26 billion in Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital.

Johann Scholtz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, says the proposals are ""as bad as it will get for UBS"" — but that could give the bank some breathing room to lobby for concessions.

""As we expected, there will be a long phase-out for UBS to deploy this, with the earliest that it will apply in full being 2034,"" says Johann Scholtz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar.

""However, negotiations will start immediately,"" he added. That means UBS ""can now lobby for some concessions and take some actions themselves to mitigate impact, for instance upstream some excess capital from its subsidiaries,"" according to the analyst.

— Ganesh Rao

Shares of UBS rose 5.4% after the Swiss government proposed strict new capital regulations which would require the banking giant to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital, following its 2023 takeover of stricken rival Credit Suisse.

The move comes on the heels of a review carried out after the forced merger of Credit Suisse with UBS to avert a full-blown banking crisis in Switzerland.

""The rise in the going-concern requirement needs to be met with up to USD 26 billion of CET1 capital, to allow the AT1 bond holdings to be reduced by around USD 8 billion,"" the government said in statement Friday, referring to UBS' holding of Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds.

On Thursday, the U.S. Treasury Department added nine economies to a ""monitoring list"" of trading partners ""whose currency practices and macroeconomic policies merit close attention.""

Back in 2020, the U.S. Treasury, under the first Trump administration, labeled Switzerland a currency manipulator, accusing it of deliberately devaluing the Swiss franc against the U.S. dollar. The department stopped short of using the term ""currency manipulator"" on Thursday.

""The SNB does not engage in any manipulation of the Swiss franc,"" the Swiss National Bank said in a statement on Friday. ""It does not seek to prevent adjustments in the balance of trade or to gain unfair competitive advantages for the Swiss economy.""

A spokesperson for the SNB noted that it may need to intervene in foreign exchange markets if deemed necessary for the Swiss economy, which recently fell into disinflation as a soaring Swiss franc lowered the cost of imports.

The safe-haven Swiss franc, which has gained around 9.5% against the U.S. currency so far this year, was last seen trading 0.2% lower against the greenback.

Stéphane Boujnah, CEO of Euronext, visited the CNBC studio in London this morning to chat to the ""Squawk Box Europe"" anchors about regional markets.

He said interest in Europe had already started to pick up ""before the Trump moment,"" but tariffs-induced volatility worsened the trend.

""Many people decided that if you want to have your money in a predictable environment, in a rule of law environment, in an environment where the basic assumption of capitalism operates, then Europe is not a bad place,"" Boujnah said. ""That translated into people shorting U.S. assets to move to Europe. It was not massive, but it's significant and continuing.""

Euronext operates exchanges in several European markets, including Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Milan.

The Bank of Russia has announced it will cut interest rates to 20% from 21%, the first reduction since September 2022. 

The inflation rate in April was 6.2%, it said, down from an average 8.2% across the first quarter of 2025.

""While domestic demand growth is still outstripping the capabilities to expand the supply of goods and services, the Russian economy is gradually returning to a balanced growth path,"" the central bank said Friday, adding that monetary policy would remain tight ""for a long period"" in order to return inflation to its 4% target.

Tesla shares were 4.5% higher in premarket trade at 4:31 a.m. ET, after a war of words between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump helped wipe $152 billion off its value on Thursday, the biggest-ever hit to its market cap.

— Jenni Reid

The European Stoxx Automobiles and Parts index is 0.5% lower in early trade, after electric vehicle behemoth Tesla saw $152 billion wiped from its market cap in the wake of CEO Elon Musk's public spat with U.S. President Donald Trump.

The sector has already seen volatile trade this week, as investors reacted to Trump doubling tariffs on steel to 50%.

BMW is currently 1% lower, while Volkswagen shares are 0.9% lower and Stellantis is down 0.8%.

Europe's Stoxx 600 index is fractionally higher at 8:17 a.m. London time, up around 0.02%, coming off the back of three positive sessions. 

The U.K.'s FTSE 100 is leading the way with a 0.15% rise as oil and gas stocks advance amid higher crude prices, though Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 are down 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively.

In case you missed it, the spat between U.S. President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, the world's richest person, entered new territory overnight.

What began with Musk publicly slamming Trump's spending bill has evolved into a full-on row between the two, with the president threatening to withdraw billions of dollars' worth of government contracts for Musk's companies. 

Musk, meanwhile, claimed Trump would never have won a second term in office without his input in the campaign, and said SpaceX would immediately decommission its Dragon spacecraft due to Trump's threats to cut funding.

In the fallout, Tesla saw $152 billion wiped off of its market cap — the biggest hit to its valuation ever.

Good morning from London.

European stocks look set to turn lower in the last trading session of the week, as investors around the world await more key data for clues on the shape of the U.S. economy.

FTSE 100 futures are currently 0.1% lower, while futures tied to the French CAC 40 and Germany's DAX are down by 0.4% and 0.1%, respectively.

Regional stocks ended Thursday's session higher after the European Central Bank trimmed interest rates in a widely anticipated move.

U.S. nonfarm payrolls data is due to be published later on Friday, with economists expecting a contraction in jobs from the previous month.

Trade tensions are also still in focus for global investors after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Thursday. Trump said the 90-minute call was ""very good"" and ""almost entirely"" focused on trade.

Overnight in Asia, stocks have been trading in mixed territory as investors digest the news that Trump and Xi held what the U.S. President described as a ""very good"" call. 

On Wall Street, U.S. stock futures are trading higher ahead of May's nonfarm payrolls data.

 Bitcoin manages to shake off a US nonfarm payrolls beat as Trump insists yet again that the Fed begins to cut interest rates — will Chair Jerome Powell listen? 

Key points:

US President Donald Trump switches his focus from Elon Musk to Fed Chair Jerome Powell as he demands interest-rate cuts.

Bitcoin continues its rebound from the Trump-Musk debacle despite strong US employment data.

Liquidity sparks fresh concerns of a downhill BTC price “cascade.”

Bitcoin (BTC) passed $104,000 at the June 6 Wall Street open as strong US labor market data contrasted with fresh calls for interest-rate cuts.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD up 2.5% on the day.

Having recovered from snap losses over the ongoing spat between US President Donald Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, markets digested fresh inflation cues as Trump turned his attention to the Federal Reserve.

“‘Too Late' at the Fed is a disaster!” he wrote in part of the day's posts on Truth Social.

Trump is no stranger to criticism of both Fed policy and Chair Jerome Powell, and has frequently demanded interest-rate cuts in 2025 — something that would benefit risk assets and crypto.

“Europe has had 10 rate cuts, we have had none. Despite him, our Country is doing great,” he continued, referring to Powell.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, markets see little chance of cuts coming before the Fed's September meeting, per data from CME Group's FedWatch Tool, with Trump's full point's worth fully priced out.

The day's nonfarm payrolls data meanwhile appeared to support the Fed's current approach, showing a resilient labor market and thus decreasing the need to lower rates.

An official release from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) confirmed that “total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 139,000 in May, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.2 percent.”

Turning to BTC price action, popular trader TheKingfisher returned to order book liquidity for clues as to market direction.

Earlier, Cointelegraph noted various downside price predictions for the short term, with commentators agreeing that BTC/USD could fall below $100,000.

“This $BTC liquidation map (optical_opti timeframe) reveals a massive cluster of long liquidations between ~99k and 102k,” part of an X post read on the day. 

TheKingfisher added that the resulting “strong imbalance” of bid versus ask liquidity increased the risk of a liquidity cascade downward.

“Normies see support; we see a liquidation trap,” the post summarized.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","I Saw the Future of Bitcoin in Vegas. It's Even Weirder Than You Think","https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-billionaires-zyn-bitcoin-conference-crypto-maga-vegas-casino-vance-2025-6","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 08:09:00 GMT","

Quiet on set, people!"" said Brock Pierce, the former child actor who grew up to be a prominent cryptocurrency entrepreneur. A hundred or so people sat in various states of conversation and intoxication at a Las Vegas Maggiano's that DNA Fund, a Pierce-founded venture, had rented out for several days during the official Bitcoin 2025 Conference last week.

We had just heard a bizarre speech from New York City's mayor, Eric Adams, who said Pierce and his colleagues in crypto were ""pioneers"" like Betsy Ross, who became a historical icon for stitching the first American flag featuring stars and stripes.

""So although the rockets' red glare and bombs burst in air, they proved through the night that our flag is still there,"" said Adams. ""That is who you are. You are the best."" Adams promised to start a crypto council for New York and to issue bitcoin bonds. He talked about how there's illegality with credit cards and fraud with the stock market. ""Let's stop the bullshit and let's open doors,"" he said.

As Pierce again called for quiet on set, the volume of the banquet room chatter came down only slightly, as the assembled guests — crypto hustlers, bitcoin true believers, fintech founders, and a few journalists — realized that the end of the restaurant's main dining room had been quickly turned into a set for ""CryptoKnights,"" the ""Shark Tank""-for-web3 show that Pierce hosts alongside the former ""Entourage"" star Adrian Grenier on Amazon Prime. At Maggiano's, Pierce had assembled a panel of judges: Grenier was absent, but there were familiar reality-show archetypes in the form of a beautiful woman and a well-muscled Chad alongside Pierce, who was outfitted in a feathered panama hat. Soon they began filming. An aspiring crypto entrepreneur made his pitch — a way to earn yield on bitcoin — but after a few minutes of back-and-forth, Pierce and the judges shot him down. His product was only a concept. Not ready for prime time.

After the show, attendees enjoyed a three-course Maggiano's meal of family-style Italian staples. Pierce, a former business partner of Steve Bannon whose recent headlines tend to center on lawsuits over a hotel in Puerto Rico and his friendship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's son Yair, held court in a corner of the restaurant where Adams was also entertaining guests. Earlier that day, Pierce had hosted a fundraising luncheon with Adams, ""Lunch With America's Bitcoin Mayor.""

With some 35,000 attendees, the Bitcoin Conference at the Venetian hotel is the world's largest gathering in crypto. At the conference, officially put on by Bitcoin Magazine, the parties and side meetings like DNA Fund's romps at Maggiano's could be just as consequential as the main event, and they sometimes featured the same speakers. Adams, the Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, the anti-death guru Bryan Johnson, and the recently pardoned crypto executive Arthur Hayes all did double duty, appearing at the Venetian and at the Maggiano's confab down the road.

For entrepreneurs like Pierce, where life is a constant montage of networking, dealmaking, and self-publicizing via social media, it was just another day. DNA House has hosted events around the world, trailing large crypto gatherings in Toronto and the United Arab Emirates. And for many of his guests, gorging on wagyu beef stuffed shells and truffle mac and cheese, it was much the same: another alcohol-soaked party in a week filled with them, as the bitcoin faithful celebrated their ascendant political power.

More than anything, Bitcoin 2025 was a victory celebration for an industry that pushed all its chips in behind Donald Trump and the Republican Party during the 2024 election cycle and won handsomely. The first day, which was dubbed Code and Country, was so replete with Republican politicians, Trump staffers, and chest-thumping executives that it might've been mistaken for CPAC. Sponsored by America250, an ostensibly nonpartisan 501(c)(3) charged with planning the events making up the government's official 250th birthday celebration, the Code and Country program ended up revealing a lot about bitcoin's evolving position in American politics.

Bitcoin's adherents still tout foundational ideas like decentralization and a libertarian exit from society, but the MAGA and big-money tilt are unmistakable. As I saw on full and often surreal display over three days and nights in Vegas, the immediate future of bitcoin lies in the cryptocurrency industry's tight alignment with Trump, and its growth is now dependent on its adoption by large corporations, union retirement funds, the federal government, and a handful of billionaires racing to acquire as much of the stuff as they can.

Bitcoiners have always leaned right — challenging the state's monopoly on issuing money can do that — but it was a broadly libertarian right that included latter-day digital goldbugs, hard-money obsessives, anti-state sovereign citizens, and cypherpunks seeking some kind of supranational independence protected by the mathematical magic of encryption. The US president was not envisioned to be among this crew, and Trump famously denounced bitcoin as a ""scam"" during his first term.

But bitcoin's role in the world has changed dramatically in the 16-plus years since the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto published a proposal for a peer-to-peer currency. Whole industries and vast political and criminal networks have grown up around bitcoin. During the conference, the value of a single token reached an all-time high of more than $111,000. For the Republican Party, bitcoin has become a proxy for freedom and a way of activating a motivated donor base that has already yielded major electoral gains.

As real money flooded into bitcoin, the cypherpunks were superseded by venture capitalists, money launderers, authoritarian tech billionaires, and a broad swath of the MAGA movement that saw bitcoin's general anti-government orientation as consistent with Trumpian populism. Many of them also saw it as a way to get rich. But the transformation of bitcoin's $2 trillion political economy has mostly left everyday retail traders behind. Even as bitcoin has soared in value, trading volume on exchanges has plummeted since its 2021 highs. It remains little used as a currency, with El Salvador, the one country to officially adopt bitcoin as a currency, scaling back its project.

In the 2024 election cycle, bitcoin's overwhelming partisan shift became impossible to ignore when the crypto industry raised more than $200 million to support Trump and a slate of largely Republican candidates. In return, the industry has seen the dismantling of crypto crime task forces across federal agencies; the loosening of financial regulation; the pardoning of the Silk Road drug market's founder, Ross Ulbricht; a reshuffling at the Securities and Exchange Commission; the veritable dismantlement of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; an end to most federal lawsuits and prosecutions against major crypto companies and individuals; the establishment of a national crypto stockpile that has the potential to buoy token prices; and, perhaps more surprisingly, the emergence of President Donald Trump as the country's most powerful crypto entrepreneur.

It's a dizzying turnabout for an industry that, last year, described itself as constantly on the defensive against a Democratic administration and regulatory state that it thought was bent on destroying it. Now, the main headache for many crypto CEOs isn't former SEC Chair Gary Gensler or Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Instead they must contend with the president himself, who, with his growing portfolio of crypto companies, has brought some unwelcome attention to an industry trying to force through Congress a friendly regulatory framework for dollar-pegged stablecoins — another business in which Trump has lately become involved.

Still, the Trumpian drama is worth it when the president has promised to give them the regulatory regime they want. Trump has pardoned a number of financial fraudsters and crypto executives, some of whom were feted in Vegas.

In Vegas, especially on the opening Code and Country day, the general feeling was of a gray-market industry being welcomed into the light and handed unprecedented influence. The sheer influx of Republican politicians spoke to that, with pro-crypto stalwarts like Sen. Cynthia Lummis, Rep. Tom Emmer, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Sen. Jim Justice, and Rep. Byron Donalds among many party notables appearing on panels. Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. had their turns on the main stage (""I truly believe we're just at the beginning. Opportunity abounds,"" said Trump Jr.), as did the White House crypto and AI czar David Sacks, the Trump advisor and campaign cochair Chris LaCivita, and the White House crypto advisor Bo Hines. On Wednesday, Vice President JD Vance, a former venture capitalist, gave the day's opening keynote to a full crowd that began assembling at 5:30 a.m.

""Thanks in particular for what you did for me and the president,"" said Vance, explaining that the crypto industry's support was ""part of the reason I'm standing here."" He added: ""With President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House.""

""The innovators in this room are making people's lives better. You deserve respect and support from your government, not bureaucrats trying to tear you down,"" said Vance, to vigorous applause.

Bitcoin-themed Trump apparel was everywhere. Vendors sold Trump 2028 hats and posters of a hardened-looking Trump covered in bitcoin iconography. With crypto having just come in from the political cold, there was an undertone of subversion to it all. Someone wore a T-shirt that read ""Everything I love to do is illegal."" Another wore an ivory white suit decorated with the word TEXIT, in support of a Texas secession movement. A company called BitcoinOS was offering a lottery to win a foreign passport — probably from Portugal, though it wasn't yet decided. A number of accountants and financial advisors on the conference floor peddled tax-mitigation strategies, with the sign from Tax Network USA offering the brazen solicitation: ""Ask Us About Tax Avoidance.""

As Trump opened his second administration by pardoning convicted fraudsters while several SEC cases were put on hold, some crypto billionaires found it safe to visit the United States. The Bitcoin 2025 conference featured an appearance by one of those crypto entrepreneurs who had recently benefited from the SEC declining to pursue a multibillion-dollar fraud case it had prepared against him. Tron's founder, Justin Sun, a Chinese crypto billionaire, became the biggest investor in Trump's World Liberty Financial and the largest purchaser of the $Trump meme coin, which earned him a gold watch at Trump's recent gala for the top 220 owners of his token. A peripatetic executive who lives in Hong Kong and claims citizenship from St. Kitts & Nevis (he's also the prime minister of an unrecognized country called Liberland), Sun hadn't been seen in the US in years. But there he was at Bitcoin 2025, where he was applauded on the main stage and photographed with industry figures.

Equally feted was Paolo Ardoino, the CEO of Tether, the world's largest stablecoin company, which operated in Hong Kong and the Caribbean for years before recently moving its headquarters to crypto-and-MAGA-friendly El Salvador. Ardoino gave a keynote speech and participated in a fireside chat on the main stage with Brandon Lutnick, the Cantor Fitzgerald executive who handles Tether's accounts, a position he inherited from his father, Howard Lutnick, Trump's commerce secretary.

""This year is your first time in the US,"" said Brandon Lutnick, more than once. Ardoino nodded. No one bothered to mention why Ardoino, who's 41, had never been to the States: His company had already reached multiple settlements with US regulators, and Ardoino and his colleagues were reportedly being investigated by the Department of Justice on suspicion of violating sanctions and anti-money-laundering rules, along with possible bank fraud (Ardoino said last year that he didn't think Tether was under criminal investigation). Before Trump's reelection, setting foot in the United States might have been a quick way for Ardoino to earn an interview with the FBI. Now, he and Sun were sought-after celebrities.

It wasn't just crypto's quasi-outlaw kingpins who were embracing a newfound freedom. Several speakers said that they had expected to be in jail this year — for what reasons, they didn't specify. The implication was less that they were operating on the margins of the law than that they were victims of government oppression — which only Trump could stop.

""Tyler, I think you mentioned that a year before that you thought it was much more likely that you'd be in the jailhouse than the White House,"" the cryptocurrency billionaire Cameron Winklevoss told his twin brother during a panel with David Sacks.

""I think the president appreciated that,"" said Sacks. ""He similarly was facing lawfare a year ago, when his political enemies were trying to put him in prison for 700 years. I think he really understood the plight of the crypto community because they were being subjected to the same kind of unfair persecution that he was.""

That night, America250 hosted a party at a pool club in the Resorts World Las Vegas complex. Companies like Exodus, Frax, Kraken, Coinbase, and Justin Sun's Tron were listed as sponsors. As guests walked in, a disembodied gloved hand reached through a black curtain, offering a complimentary flute of Champagne. The open bar provided generous pours, and the bathroom attendants had free Zyn. Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, the legendary hip-hop group, came out for a performance. Rosie Rios, the chair of America250 who, on a conference panel that day, described herself as a ""fiscal conservative,"" bobbed her head as they rapped about blunts and rum. The goldbug Peter Schiff, who, while facing tax and money laundering investigations over his private bank in Puerto Rico, has made a sideline out of media appearances sparring with bitcoiners, sat on a couch surrounded by a retinue of young women. Bottles of iced Moët rested on tables in poolside cabanas. (Schiff, who sued the IRS, has accused government authorities of conspiring to frame his bank.)

Bone Thugs transitioned into their song ""1st of Tha Month"" — a gold-charting, mid-'90s anthem celebrating the date when welfare checks arrive — as a group of women in cow costumes marched out carrying glowing signs that read ""Steak 'n Shake"" and ""Accepts BTC."" Above the stage, a large screen lit up with the Steak 'n Shake logo. A half-dozen suited Steak 'n Shake representatives looked on approvingly from behind a velvet rope.

This sort of hallucinatory marketing stunt — part of Steak 'n Shake's ongoing MAGA/MAHA pivot, as the fast-food chain embraces beef tallow and bitcoin — was essentially standard fare for a week filled with constant offers, giveaways, pop culture callouts, and promises of easy riches and financial liberation. Everyone was hustling, selling, promising the world. ""Earn Bitcoin While You Sleep,"" went a pitch from a mining company handing out branded fedoras. ""Unlock Passive Income."" The built environment, including some people's clothing and the napkins on tables, seemed overrun with QR codes. There was always another bitcoin raffle to enter or party to seek out, and the difference between what was legitimate and what wasn't could be a matter of interpretation.

The next night, at a wood-paneled bar on the 66th floor of the Conrad hotel, a crypto mining company called Digital Shovel threw a party with Maxim, the old lad mag. The names of both brands were printed across a blue curtain, in front of which guests and models hired from a local agency took photos. Asked about the role of Maxim in this venture, Scot Johnson, the president and CEO of Digital Shovel, told a group of journalists that he had rented the brand name for the evening.

Later, I ended up at a party for the Taproot Wizards, a kind of low-fi, deliberately unserious group of coiners who wish to ""make bitcoin magical again."" Walking into the psychedelically lit Discoshow venue at the Linq Hotel, I was handed a shiny silver wizard hat and cape, which I duly put on. A bearded man in full mage garb held out his hand, offering what looked like a brown capsule.

""Take it,"" he said.

""What is it?"" I asked.

""It's drugs.""

""Can I know which kind?""

""It's mushrooms.""

I took it and enjoyed what seemed like the suspiciously familiar taste of a brown M&M.

Inside, the bar served free cocktails and cans of Liquid Death water. A few dozen people milled about in wizard clothes, the place emanating a ""D&D fans throw a party"" vibe. A handful of folks danced to a DJ set in a room so covered in screens and glowing panels that there was a seizure warning by the entrance. There was goofiness and some networking-free fun. No one seemed to be talking about bitcoin. And unfortunately, it was just an M&M.

In Vegas, the future of bitcoin was corporate. ""Bitcoin treasury companies,"" publicly traded corporations that are essentially holding vehicles for accumulating bitcoin, were all the rage, as several CEOs took turns paying tribute to Michael Saylor, the tech executive who has borrowed billions of dollars to turn turn his enterprise software company MicroStrategy into one of the world's largest holders of bitcoin. Saylor has encouraged other companies to adopt his ""playbook,"" and GameStop and Trump Media recently announced that they would follow suit. Nakamoto, the company whose name sat atop most Bitcoin 2025 conference branding and signage, is a bitcoin treasury company headed by David Bailey, the principal figure behind the conference.

In panel presentations, CEOs described future markets in which most companies would have bitcoin on their books, if not being explicitly devoted to it. Financial institutions and individual investors could then buy shares in those companies, like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet, which are publicly traded, and benefit from those companies' bitcoin exposure, broadening the circle of prosperity. A similar philosophy undergirded the growing adoption of ETFs, Wall Street funds that provide investors exposure to bitcoin without making customers go through the trouble of purchasing actual bitcoins. (These financial firms, in turn, benefit from the fees they reap from managing investments in ETFs, bitcoin treasury companies, and other crypto-based financial products.)

""At the end of the day, it's a game and we're all going to win together,"" said Fold CEO Will Reeves, whose company had recently begun building its bitcoin treasury.

""We're going to be the biggest companies in the world,"" said Simon Gerovich, the president of Metaplanet.

Saylor, the silver-haired 60-year-old executive whose self-described ""religious"" embrace of bitcoin has catalyzed this corporate treasury movement, was one of the conference's chief draws. His keynote, on the event's third and final day, was standing-room only. Wearing all black except for a silver bitcoin pendant that hung below his throat, Saylor emerged to rock-star-level applause. Speaking in his typically craggy voice, he preached a post-cypherpunk prosperity gospel under the unassuming title ""21 Ways to Wealth."" Acknowledging that he was used to speaking to top corporate executives and politicians, Saylor said he was happy to now be speaking to the people, bringing them the digital fire of Prometheus.

""Satoshi gave you an idea worth half of everything on earth,"" said Saylor. ""The greatest idea in the history of the human race.""

Scrolling through 21 instructive axioms — ""master artificial intelligence,"" ""domicile where sovereignty respects your freedom"" — each accompanied by an AI-generated image, Saylor told his audience not to ""chase your own good ideas."" Only one pursuit mattered. Everyone listening should sell or mortgage everything they have, take out loans upon loans, and use it all to buy as much bitcoin as they could as quickly as possible. ""Raise and reinvest capital relentlessly — velocity compounds wealth,"" read one slide. Saylor described how a dentist whose practice brought in a couple of hundred thousand dollars in annual revenue could theoretically — through a series of corporate maneuvers, loans, share sales, and lines of credit — become a bitcoin billionaire. Why aspire to be merely rich when you could be the ""first billionaire dentist on your block,"" he said.

A constant on the bitcoin media circuit, Saylor talks in comically overwrought tones about bitcoin's power and perfection. He exhibits the personal commitment and persuasive abilities of the leader of a sophisticated multi-level marketing scheme. Over the past few years, Saylor has raised billions of dollars in debt to make periodic bitcoin purchases, MicroStrategy's stock has soared, and his once criticized thesis of constant corporate bitcoin accumulation is on the verge of being widely imitated. (Last year, Saylor agreed to pay $40 million to settle a tax fraud lawsuit filed by the Washington, DC, attorney general.)

""This is a race to capitalize on bitcoin,"" Saylor said, sounding far more zero-sum than the we're-all-going-to-win CEOs who had praised him hours earlier. ""He who has the most bitcoin at the end of the game wins."" The crowd cheered.

Ross Ulbricht, the speaker who followed Saylor, had attained practically mythological status among diehard bitcoiners. One of the first major dark web drug markets and a transformational event in bitcoin's history, the Silk Road provided it a clear use case: buying drugs online. As one former Silk Road customer turned crypto industry professional once told me, the Silk Road was the greatest onboarding event in bitcoin history. For years after Ulbricht received multiple life sentences without parole, coiners had lobbied for his release, until Trump pardoned him on January 21 of this year.

After an introductory video chronicling his years in prison followed by shots of him surfing, swimming, and diving into waterfalls, Ulbricht came out to warm applause. But the crowd had thinned since Saylor's commanding speech — some chairs sat empty — and would get thinner as Ulbricht went on. He tried to rouse the audience with a cry of ""Freedom!"" and a raised fist.

""I'm so, so thankful that we elected him and he is who he is,"" Ulbricht said of Trump. ""He's a man of integrity.""

However foundational Ulbricht had been to bitcoin's early growth, the movement seemed to have passed him by. In his speech, he acknowledged starting the Silk Road but said almost nothing about why he went to prison, the drug war, or the flawed criminal justice system (some Silk Road investigators were prosecuted for stealing evidence). There were some general appeals to principle, but it was a stilted, overlong presentation by a figurehead who seemed to have been far more appreciated when he was locked up out of view.

Ulbricht offered a stem-winding anecdote about renting a secluded cabin, where he planned to grow magic mushrooms for his nascent drug market. He found the cabin covered in seven wasp nests. The wasps reflected some of Ulbricht's most treasured principles — freedom and decentralization. But they lacked another, unity, which made it easy for him to destroy each nest in turn. What kind of unity Ulbricht was looking for wasn't clear.

No one seemed as jazzed about Ulbricht's stoic devotion to decentralization as they did about Saylor promising to share the everlasting cyberfire of half the world's wealth. The conference's closing keynote — an appearance by the bitcoin political cause celebre, on the 10th anniversary of his being sentenced to a lifetime in prison — ended with tepid applause and a rush to the exits. In a week of politically infused celebrations, this was supposed to be Ulbricht's moment. There had been a special lunch for him that day, one of many fundraisers since his release. The conference included the auctioning of his prison art and the jumpsuit he wore on the day of his release. ""Free Ross,"" a mantra that had been printed on stickers handed out at every bitcoin event for a decade, had won. But bitcoin's top political prisoner, its once occluded hero, had bored a crowd with abstract talk of freedom and insects.

That night, I went to another bitcoin-related party at a nightclub in the Venetian. A healthcare recruiter in her late 40s named Jen, who lived in Atlanta, told me about converting her retirement account to bitcoin tokens and shares in bitcoin ETFs. A DJ played some recent hits while a mix of middle-aged coiners and Gen Z club kids swayed and pawed at each other's bodies. Some women in gravity-defying dresses danced on an elevated bar while velvet ropes denoted exclusive areas, where tables could run a couple of thousand dollars.

""I've had such a hard time orange-pilling my friends,"" she told me. But her bitcoin investments had gone up 140% in the past year. Wasn't that proof of something? She asked if I had done the same. I gave a halting answer about not investing in what I write about and not really having much of a retirement account anyway. She looked at me as if I were from another planet before her face adopted a look of profound concern.

""You have to do it.""

I said I would.

This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

Bitcoin's BTC$104,655.32 broader outlook is constructive, but its short-term prospects remain bleak, according to technical analysis.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value has bounced back to nearly $104,000 from its overnight low of $104.30, alongside positive action in U.S. equity futures.

However, a closer look at the hourly price chart reveals that the bounce is likely a classic breakdown and retest play – the cryptocurrency dove out of a head-and-shoulders pattern on Thursday, signalling a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change, and prices are now revisiting the breakdown point, called the neckline.

This happens because early sellers – those who shorted at the time of the breakdown – are quick to take profits, consistent with the prospect theory of behavioral analysis.

It leads to a bounce that usually runs into fresh selling at the neckline from those who missed the initial breakdown. These fresh shorts lead to the next leg lower.

In other words, BTC is not out of the woods yet, and prices could turn lower from around $104,000, extending the pullback. The immediate support is at $100,000, followed by $95,500. The latter is arrived at by subtracting the height of the H&S pattern from the breakdown point.

On the higher side, a move above $107,000 is needed to invalidate the bearish setup and shift focus to record highs.

The cryptocurrency market experienced a sudden crash on Thursday after Circle, the issuer of USDC stablecoin, went public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to $100,000 levels with a 3% pullback, while Ethereum (ETH) recorded a nearly 8% decline, and Ripple's XRP saw an almost 5% drop. 

The shakeout resulted in nearly $1 billion worth of liquidations in the crypto market, with buyers incurring $888 million in losses, compared to $99 million in short liquidations. At the time of writing, BTC, ETH, and XRP are recovering, with over a 1% jump on Friday, indicating a bullish breather may be at hand. 

Bitcoin's recovery is approaching 1.50% at press time on Friday, shrugging off the sudden 3% drop last night. As a bullish candle springs above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $100,908, Bitcoin resurfaces above the $102,500 zone, which acted as a crucial support zone in May. 

The persistent bullish failures to sustain an uptrend above $102,500 formed a head and shoulders pattern on the daily chart shared below. Bitcoin's recovery on the day aims to invalidate the pattern if BTC closes above the zone. 

However, the momentum indicators signal downside risk as the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) shows a bearish trend with the average lines approaching the centre line. In addition, the RSI at 46 spikes towards the halfway line after the recent drop, signaling an overall decline in bullish momentum. 

If Bitcoin's closing price holds above the $103,000 mark, it will mark a bear trap, resulting in a surge towards the all-time high at $111,980.

Conversely, sideline traders looking for a sell signal could find the 50-day EMA breakdown to be an entry spot. The next key support level is at the 100-day EMA at $96,757. 

Ethereum is up nearly 1.50% in the day at press time, after a decline of over 7% on Thursday, breaking below the 200-day EMA at $2,460, which had acted as the lower boundary of a consolidation range. 

ETH's intraday growth on Friday creates a bullish candle and attempts to reclaim the dynamic support to nullify the breakdown, as previously seen on May 18 and May 19. However, the previous closing prices were bound within the price range, marking this potential attempt as a bear trap. 

Similar to Bitcoin, the momentum indicators project increased downside risk as the MACD and its signal line remain in a freefall, while the RSI at 48 prolongs the declining trend below the halfway line. 

If Ethereum bounces above the 200-day EMA at $2,460, it could rise towards the range's upper ceiling near $2,700.

However, a closing below the 100-day EMA at $2,307 could extend ETH's losses towards $2,000. 

Ripple's XRP token shows a similar recovery on Friday as Bitcoin and Ethereum in attempts to shrug off last night's drop. Holding above the 200-day EMA near the $2 psychological support, XRP eyes to reclaim the lost $2.13 level. 

The momentum indicators in XRP mirror those of Bitcoin and Ethereum, signaling a loss of bullish momentum as the gains made earlier this week deplete. 

A daily close above $2.13 could test the converging 50-day and 100-day EMAs near $2.25.

If XRP breaks below the 200-day EMA, it could extend the declining trend to the $1.79 support level, the lowest closing price in April.

Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), a Solana-based meme coin boasting a market capitalization of slightly over $1 billion, is extending its gains, trading at around $1.08 at the time of writing on Friday. 

The cryptocurrency market capitalization drops 4% to $3.3 trillion amid growing concerns about tariffs and global trade. Bitcoin rebounds after testing support slightly above $100,000, reflecting weak sentiment in the broader crypto market.

Meme coins market capitalization has dropped by over 5% to $56.34 billion in the last 24 hours, with top names such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) declining further in a falling wedge pattern.

Solana (SOL) edges higher by 2% at press time on Friday as it avoids a drop to the $140 support zone. However, the Solana price trend is approaching its second consecutive bearish week close, following a near 6% drop on Thursday.

Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled to a low of $101,095 on Friday amid volatility in the market. The effect of the tussle between United States (US) President Donald Trump and Tesla Chief Elon Musk negatively influenced the NASDAQ and Tesla's stock price on Thursday, although both are recovering on Friday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Bullish Signs For Ethereum: Metrics Pointing To Upcoming Breakout","https://www.tradingview.com/news/newsbtc:7e1f665e6094b:0-bullish-signs-for-ethereum-metrics-pointing-to-upcoming-breakout/","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 14:30:09 GMT","

The Ethereum (ETH) price experienced a significant decline on Thursday, falling over 7% and approaching the $2,400 mark. However, expert analysis suggests that a new bullish trend may soon emerge for the second-largest cryptocurrency. 

Key Metrics Indicate Accumulation By Larger Investors

Market analyst Lark Davis took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to share insights on Ethereum's potential. He noted that various on-chain metrics and market behaviors indicate an impending breakout for the ETH price. 

Notably, Ethereum has been outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) in the second quarter of the year, suggesting growing investor confidence. The recent Pectra upgrade has improved Ethereum's scalability and reduced its inflation rate, making it more attractive to investors. 

Additionally, the expert highlights that with exchange balances hitting seven-year lows and substantial inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), it appears that larger investors are accumulating ETH for the long term.

Despite these bullish indicators, Davis cautioned that not all market participants share this optimistic outlook. Betting markets on Polymarket currently assign only a 27% chance that Ethereum will reach a new all-time high by 2025. 

Critical Support For Ethereum Amid Political Disputes

The broader cryptocurrency market also faced challenges on Thursday, with total market capitalization dropping from $3.30 trillion to approximately $3.12 trillion. Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana (SOL) were among the notable cryptocurrencies experiencing losses, retracing by 3%, 5%, and 6%, respectively.

In a separate but related development, tensions between US President Donald Trump and his former adviser Elon Musk have surfaced, adding to the day's market volatility. 

Trump expressed disappointment over Musk's criticism of a key tax and spending bill from his administration, suggesting that their “great relationship” may be nearing its end. Musk retaliated by accusing Trump of ingratitude, claiming his support was instrumental in Trump's election victory. 

This public dispute has drawn attention to the intersection of US politics and cryptocurrency, a dynamic that market analyst Income Sharks noted in a recent post on Elon Musk's social media site, X. 

The analyst remarked on the swift impact of political conflicts on crypto markets, emphasizing that the Ethereum price has not yet lost critical support levels. 

Income Sharks, in his analysis, identified the $2,390 mark as a crucial support point for the altcoin in the immediate term, which could determine the next upward targets of $3,000 and $4,000.

While trading at $2,406 when writing, Ethereum finds itself well below its all-time high reached during the market's last bullish cycle in 2021. As of now, the altcoin stands 50% below its record of $4,878, according to CoinGecko data.

Ethereum has so far underperformed in this market cycle but looks ready to mount a parabolic rally based on analysts' predictions. Crypto analyst Crypto Bullet recently highlighted a bullish pattern on ETH's chart, which provides a bullish outlook for the altcoin. 

Ethereum Eyes $3,300 As Morningstar Candle Pattern Forms

In an X post, Crypto Bullet predicted that Ethereum could rally to $3,300 as a Morningstar Candle pattern forms for the largest altcoin by market cap. This came as he highlighted the bullish monthly close for ETH and alluded to the monthly chart printing this bullish pattern. With this, the analyst expects a significant rally from Ethereum. 

Crypto Bullet noted that Ethereum is now facing tough resistance, but he believes that the $2,500 resistance will be broken. The analyst added that his next target is $3,300. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ash Crypto also provided a bullish analysis for ETH, in which he declared that the Wyckoff accumulation was still in play. 

He remarked that the first major level to reclaim is $3,100, which will be followed by a small correction. Following that, Ash Crypto is confident that ETH will then surge to $4,000, which will initiate an explosive rally. The analyst affirmed that $10,000 is programmed for ETH in this cycle. 

As NewsBTC reported, crypto analyst Crypto GEM recently predicted that Ethereum could rally to $8,000 by next year. Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also highlighted $5,000, $7,000, and $8,500 as the targets for ETH's market structure. 

Meanwhile, just like Ash Crypto, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto is also confident that the altcoin can reach as high as $10,000 in this market cycle. He highlighted a similarity between Ethereum's current price action and that of the 2017 market cycle. 

Ongoing V-Shape Recovery For ETH

In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted an ongoing V-shape recovery for Ethereum. He noted that ETH has kicked off a sharp reversal, forming a classic V-shape structure on the weekly chart. His accompanying chart showed that ETH could rally to as high as $7,600 on this run-up. 

Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto stated that Ethereum is flirting with a breakout. The analyst further noted that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is already breaking out. His accompanying chart showed that ETH could rally to as high as $3,600 on this breakout. He also declared that the fifth time of ETH's move to the MA20 will be a thrust through. The altcoin is expected to break the $2,600 resistance on this move. 

At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $2,450, down almost 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

A sharp pullback characterized the broader cryptocurrency market on Thursday, leading to a bearish pattern break in Bitcoin (BTC) to briefly test the $100k levels. The market-wide panic with the Bitcoin sell-off led to quick profit bookings in altcoins such as Lido DAO (LDO), Jupiter (JUP), and Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET). 

At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $101,724 as it bounces off the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $100,860. The price action shows BTC breaking out of a Head-and-Shoulders pattern with a neckline near $102,250, as shared in the chart below. 

The momentum indicators' sell signal for traders aligns with the price movement as the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicator line and its signal line fall closer to the centre line while the red histogram bars rise in the negative territory. On a similar trend, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 42 breaks below the halfway line, with the recent plunge signaling a significant decline in bullish momentum. 

The immediate 50-day EMA support helps sustain BTC above $100K for the moment. Suppose the crypto price takes a reversal from the broken neckline to breach the 50-day EMA. It could target $96,732, aligning with the 100-day EMA. 

If the short-term BTC price reclaims the lost neckline at $102,250, investors could witness Bitcoin push to $106,749, the weekly high. 

LDO takes a breather after the 14% drop on Thursday, with no significant price movement at press time in early Asian hours. Lido DAO falls under the $0.80 level but avoids a closing below May's low at $0.741. 

Currently, the altcoin finds support from a declining trendline formed by the daily lows of May 18, 20, and 31. Completing a falling wedge with the support trendline, swing highs in LDO on January 31, May 13, and June 4 give rise to a converging resistance trendline.

The MACD indicator line and its signal line plunge in the negative direction, while the RSI at 39 signals room for a pullback before the altcoin reaches oversold conditions shortly. 

If the LDO closing price dives below the $0.741 support, it will mark a decisive breakdown of the falling wedge pattern. Sideline investors looking to sell can find entry opportunities in such a case, with the price target at $0.630, the lowest daily close since July 2022.

On the flip side, a bounce back could face resistance at the 50-day EMA at $0.894. 

Similar to Bitcoin, Jupiter price action reveals a Head-and-Shoulders pattern breakout triggered by an 11.70% drop on Thursday. At the time of writing, Jupiter is at $0.4585, remaining silent in the day after the crash. 

Shaping the bearish pattern, the 200-day EMA influences the head peak, while the 100-day EMA dynamic resistance creates the two shoulders, as shown in the chart below. Following the $0.4764 neckline break, the path of least resistance suggests a downward move to the $0.4019 support level, the lowest price reached in May. 

Increasing the downside risk, the momentum indicators reveal bearish dominance. The MACD indicator shows increasing red histogram bars while the RSI at 39 approaches the oversold boundary. 

JUP/USDT daily price chart. Source: Tradingview

However, a reversal in JUP closing above the broken neckline at $0.4764 could propel it to the 50-day EMA at $0.5139. 

FET evaporates the early week gains with two consecutive bearish days and is down nearly 5% so far this week. The AI token breaks under the 50-day and 100-day EMA merger near $0.75 and approaches the $0.70 support level highlighted by the low on May 19.

Typically, price action backs the thesis to buy at support levels, but the momentum indicators trigger a sell signal for FET as it approaches the $0.70 support level. Similar to other altcoins, the MACD indicator is characterized by rising red histograms and a downward trajectory of average lines in the negative territory. 

The RSI at 43 slips below the halfway line, indicating a loss in bullish momentum with room on the downside before hitting the oversold boundary.

If FET leaps off the $0.70 level, the merged EMAs at $0.75 could be immediate resistance.

However, a slip below $0.70 could push FET down to the $0.50 psychological level.

Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), a Solana-based meme coin boasting a market capitalization of slightly over $1 billion, is extending its gains, trading at around $1.08 at the time of writing on Friday. 

The cryptocurrency market capitalization drops 4% to $3.3 trillion amid growing concerns about tariffs and global trade. Bitcoin rebounds after testing support slightly above $100,000, reflecting weak sentiment in the broader crypto market.

Meme coins market capitalization has dropped by over 5% to $56.34 billion in the last 24 hours, with top names such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) declining further in a falling wedge pattern.

Solana (SOL) edges higher by 2% at press time on Friday as it avoids a drop to the $140 support zone. However, the Solana price trend is approaching its second consecutive bearish week close, following a near 6% drop on Thursday.

Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled to a low of $101,095 on Friday amid volatility in the market. The effect of the tussle between United States (US) President Donald Trump and Tesla Chief Elon Musk negatively influenced the NASDAQ and Tesla's stock price on Thursday, although both are recovering on Friday.

SUI, one of the leading altcoins of this cycle, has recorded an impressive price recovery over the past two months. However, as the cryptocurrency fails to hold some key levels, some analysts warn of a potential drop below the $3.00 support.

SUI Rally Risks Massive Price Drop

Since hitting its four-month high of $4.29, SUI's price has been moving sideways, hovering between $3.40-$4.00 throughout most of May. Amid last week's market retrace, the altcoin recorded a 14.2% price drop, losing its range and hitting the $3.00 support over the weekend.

At the start of this week, SUI saw a mild recovery alongside the rest of the market, surging to the $3.20 area. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency has failed to hold this level over the past 24 hours and dropped to the $3.10-$3.15 area on Thursday morning.

Crypto analyst Carl Runefelt warned that the cryptocurrency's rally could be in danger as it risks breaking down of a descending triangle pattern.

Per the post, the altcoin has been trading within this formation for the past month, also displaying a potential Head & Shoulders setup forming inside of the triangle, and the pattern's baseline sitting around the $3.10 support.

To the analyst, “if it breaks out of this triangle to the downside, then the fall can be very hard,” forecasting a nearly 35% retrace toward the $2.00 mark. On the contrary, a breakout to the upside could propel SUI's price toward the $4.20 resistance.

Analyst Crypto Bullet recently highlighted a “humongous” rising wedge pattern in the cryptocurrency's chart, which eyes the $8-$10 area as the next major target. According to the chart, SUI has been moving within this pattern since early 2024, hovering between the upper and lower boundaries for over a year.

Notably, the cryptocurrency hit the support trendline one more time during the April low, bouncing from this level. Based on this, the analyst considers that the current dip could be “the last opportunity to add to your bags before SUI makes a new ATH.”

Can It Repeat Its Late 2024 Playbook?

Analyst Rekt Capital noted that SUI was positioned for a bullish Monthly Candle Close in May, aiming to replicate its late 2024 performance. Last year, the cryptocurrency retested the $3.39 level and turned it into support, which acted as a springboard toward its January 2025 all-time high (ATH) of $5.35.

This time, May closed below this crucial level, failing to confirm it as support and losing the recent price range. SUI is now “showcasing very early signs of upside wicking into said level to turn it into new resistance.”

The analyst warned that June could see the cryptocurrency reject from this level “if things don't change over the course of this month.” SUI is currently located inside the $2.33-$3.39 price range and is trying to position itself for a reclaim of the Range High to facilitate a breakout.

However, it has unsuccessfully attempted to surge to that level, which could send the price toward lower levels if it “continues to float here without covering additional ground.”

Therefore, SUI risks dropping 10% toward the $2.81 mid-range area, which acted as support and weak resistance earlier this year, and falling 30% to the $2.33 range low if the previous level doesn't hold.

“If SUI fails to show signs of reclaiming $3.39 as support (at least on the Daily timeframe via Daily Closes above $3.39), then sub-$3 regions could be on the cards,” the analyst concluded.

As of this writing, SUI trades at $3.08, a 2.3% decline in the daily timeframe.

WisdomTree‘s head of product Jason Guthrie says the blockchain industry is in its “selling books” phase similar to Amazon's early days, with massive expansion ahead as financial services adopt on-chain infrastructure to reduce costs and improve efficiency.

“Right now as an industry we're selling books but we're going to go into all of these new spaces,” Guthrie told Benzinga at Consensus 2025, drawing parallels between crypto's current state and Amazon's evolution from bookseller to cloud computing giant. 

“Anyone that saw Amazon in the '90s would never have pictured AWS.”

WisdomTree, a traditional asset management firm with $115 billion in assets under management, has been expanding into digital assets over the past four to five years through a dedicated division focused on bringing “real-world exposures on chain.”

Guthrie emphasized that blockchain's value proposition centers on “smoothing out workflows and improving capital efficiency and transparency,” while maintaining regulatory compliance.

The executive addressed skeptics by highlighting the organic innovation emerging from the crypto space. 

Speculate on price movements, claim up to $200 in bonuses, and start with risk-free paper trading with crypto futures on Plus500.

“Do a little bit of research and have a look at just the amount of organic innovation that we've seen,” he advised. 

Rather than pursuing complete disintermediation, Guthrie envisions a more nuanced evolution of financial services. 

Guthrie predicts “a consolidation of providers,” which should leverage internet-native infrastructure to deliver fundamental services for investing.

The executive emphasized that blockchain adoption requires patience and incremental progress. “No technology innovation comes in overnight,” he cautioned.

A group of eight crypto policy organizations has urged US Congress leaders to support a recently re-introduced bill to protect software developers by including it in market structure legislation.

On Thursday, eight crypto policy organizations shared a joint statement calling for the inclusion of the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA) in market structure legislation, seeking to offer a safe harbor for software developers and infrastructure providers.

H.R. 3533 was first introduced in 2023 by Republican Representative Tom Emmer and has now been reintroduced on May 21, 2025, as a bipartisan effort, with Democratic Representative Ritchie Torres as a co-sponsor.

The BRCA is “critical for protecting software developers,” as it proposed that no blockchain developer or provider of a blockchain service “shall be treated as a money transmitter or as engaging in ‘money transmitting', (…), unless the developer or provider has, in the regular course of business, control over digital assets to which a user is entitled under the blockchain service or the software created, maintained, or disseminated by the blockchain developer or provider.”



The policy groups' statement affirmed that developers creating peer-to-peer, non-custodial software and infrastructure providers who facilitate decentralized networks have “little in common” with traditional finance institutions. As such, they should not be treated as the same.

“The BRCA acknowledges this reality and ensures that when software developers or blockchain service providers do not control or custody customer funds, they are not inappropriately required to register as ‘money transmitting businesses' or liable for failing to do so,” the joint statement reads.

A policy lead told journalist Eleanor Terret that “it's critically important that we don't treat open-source developers like traditional financial institutions,” adding, “The BRCA draws that line clearly and protects innovation.”

The crypto coalition, comprised of the DeFi Education Fund, Coin Center, Solana Policy Institute, The Digital Chamber, Blockchain Association, Crypto Council for Innovation, Paradigm, and Bitcoin Policy Institute, urged lawmakers to support the BRCA's inclusion in the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025.

We strongly encourage the House of Representatives to include the BRCA in the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, and ensure that innovators across America can safely build financial infrastructure here – at home.

The bill, also known as the CLARITY Act, was introduced on May 29 by French Hill, Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. The bipartisan legislation aims to establish a regulatory framework for crypto assets in the US, providing the long-awaited clarity and protection for the industry.

“Our bill brings long-overdue clarity to the digital asset ecosystem, prioritizes consumer protection and American innovation, and builds off our work in the 118th Congress,” Hill stated. As Terret reported, the Financial Services Committee has scheduled a markup for the CLARITY Act for June 10, 2025, alongside multiple other bills.

The DeFi Education Fund, which has previously advocated for the protection of software developers, concluded on X that “Congress has an opportunity to protect developers of non-custodial peer-to-peer software protocols from being unreasonably targeted for regulation.”

 Orange Cap Games has acquired the IP rights to Moonbirds from Yuga Labs, driving the NFT collection's biggest sales spike in months. 

Ethereum-based non-fungible token (NFT) collection Moonbirds saw a resurgence in market activity following the sale of its intellectual property (IP) to blockchain game development studio Orange Cap Games. 

On June 6, data from NFT data aggregator CryptoSlam revealed that Moonbirds reached a weekly sales volume of over $2 million, up 2,525% from the previous week. For monthly volumes, the collection had surpassed its sales performance for all of May by June 6. 

In June, the collection has sales of around $1.4 million so far, up 43% from May's $900,000. Moonbirds also reached over 1,000 transactions in the last seven days, a 877% increase over the previous week. 

Thanks to the surge, Moonbirds is now the seventh-ranked NFT collection in weekly sales, surpassing popular collections including Pudgy Penguins and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). 

This is also the most significant uptick in Moonbirds sales in recent months, signaling investor optimism after NFT company Yuga Labs sold the IP to Orange Cap Games.

On May 30, the game development studio announced that it had acquired the IP of Ethereum-based NFT collections Moonbirds, Mythics and Oddities from Yuga Labs. The acquisition marked a shift for the Moonbirds ecosystem, with Orange Cap Games taking creative and developmental control of the project. 

Yuga Labs CEO Greg Solano said Moonbirds “deserve a team whose whole world is the birds.” The Yuga Labs executive expressed confidence that Orange Cap Games is the right steward to help Moonbirds achieve its potential. 

Orange Cap Games is known for developing Vibes, a hybrid trading card game integrating physical and digital gameplay elements. The game features Pudgy Penguins IP, allowing players to collect and trade using cards in both the physical and digital worlds.

The Moonbirds sales uptick comes as digital collectibles showed a resurgence in May, breaking a downward trend throughout 2025. 

NFT sales reached $476 million in May, up 27% compared to April. This marked the first monthly sales increase in 2025, after a five-month decline since December 2024. 

The month also showed a significant uptick in unique NFT buyers, reaching 936,000. This figure shows a 50% increase compared to April's 622,000.

What Happened: The Justice Department is moving to seize a range of cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins, Bitcoin BTC/USD, NFTs, and Ethereum ETH/USD Name Service domains—stored in self-custody wallets and Binance accounts. These assets are tied to a civil forfeiture complaint filed on June 5 in federal court in Washington, DC.

The DOJ claims that North Korean IT workers, under false identities, earned the crypto while working remotely for blockchain firms. The funds were originally frozen in April 2023 after Sim Hyon Sop, a China-based banker, was indicted for allegedly helping facilitate the money laundering scheme.

The Justice Department alleges that the North Korean IT workers used fake identification documents and other strategies to secure employment in multiple countries. After being paid—often in stablecoins like USDC and Tether—the workers allegedly employed money laundering methods such as chain hopping and converting tokens into NFTs to conceal the source of the funds.

Why It Matters: This development follows a series of incidents involving North Korean IT workers. In May 2025, North Korean operatives were found infiltrating U.S. remote jobs, funneling millions into North Korea's economy. 

Cybersecurity firm DTEX likened North Korea's cybercrime operations to a mafia organization, with Fortune 500 companies exploited to fund North Korea's nuclear program. Earlier in February 2025, North Korea's Lazarus Group was suspected in a $1.4 billion crypto hack on Bybit.

You've probably heard the phrase NFT royalties thrown around like digital confetti, but what does it actually mean? Think of it like this: every time someone resells a piece of digital art, music, or collectible you created, you get a little slice of the pie—automatically. No chasing people down, no paperwork, just sweet, passive income landing in your crypto wallet.

That's the dream, right? Create something once, and get paid again and again every time it changes hands. For digital creators, this sounds like the holy grail of internet art: work less, earn more.

But here's the million-dollar (or at least million-satoshi) question: Can NFT royalties really be trusted to keep the cash—or crypto—flowing forever? Or is this all just a digital daydream waiting to fade out with the next bear market?

Let's dig in.

Okay, time to peek behind the curtain: how do NFT royalties actually work? Is there a magical robot accountant keeping tabs on resales and sending out crypto coins? Kinda.

At the heart of it all are smart contracts—basically, bits of code that live on the blockchain and do exactly what they're told, no questions asked. When you create an NFT and list it for sale, you can embed a rule in the smart contract that says, “Hey, every time this NFT is resold, send me 5% (or whatever percentage I choose).” It's like setting up a tip jar that automatically refills itself every time someone else gets their hands on your art.

Most creators set royalties between 2.5% and 10%, depending on the platform and how bold they're feeling. Want to keep it chill? Go low. Feeling spicy? Ask for more. The cool thing is, this cut gets taken out of each secondary sale and sent straight to your wallet—no middlemen, no awkward payment reminders.

Now, not all NFT marketplaces are created equal. Some are super royalty-friendly. Platforms like OpenSea, Rarible, and Foundation let creators bake in their royalties right from the start. These platforms are basically like your chill artist friends who always split the check fairly.

But here's the twist (you knew there'd be one): just because you set royalties doesn't mean every platform honors them. Some newer marketplaces have started skipping out on royalty payments to attract sellers and buyers with lower fees—which has sparked quite the drama in NFT town. (More on that tea later.)

So yes, NFT royalties are a pretty neat system—at least in theory. But is it all smooth sailing from here? Not quite.

Let's talk about why NFT royalties have artists doing virtual backflips.

Traditionally, when you sold a piece of art, that was it. You got paid once, and if that art resold later for millions? You'd get… nada. NFT royalties flipped that script.

Think of it like Spotify royalties, but without a million middlemen taking a cut.

Royalties give creators more than just money—they offer independence. Artists, musicians, photographers, and even meme makers can now:

This is a big deal in the digital economy. For once, the internet is helping creators keep ownership of their art and their income.

A few examples of NFT royalty magic in action:

Sure, not everyone is making millions, but these stories show what's possible when royalties work as promised. For many creators, it's less about hitting the jackpot and more about getting paid fairly, consistently, and automatically.

NFT royalties, at their best, turn creativity into a sustainable hustle.

Okay, so NFT royalties sound like a dream, right? Passive income, creative freedom, and no stuffy gatekeepers telling you what to do. But before you quit your job to become a full-time NFT artist, let's talk about the not-so-glamorous side.

Royalties only come in when an NFT is resold. So what happens if nobody's buying or selling your work anymore? Yup—no resale = no royalty.And the NFT market? It's about as stable as your friend's crypto portfolio during a bear market.

In short: NFT royalties depend on ongoing demand, and that can be a wild ride.

Here's the kicker: NFT royalties aren't hardcoded into the blockchain itself. They're usually enforced by platforms like OpenSea, Rarible, or Magic Eden—meaning…

It's kind of like leaving a tip at a restaurant: expected, but not always enforced. Unless platforms agree to work together (spoiler: they don't always), creators can get left out.

Some buyers purposely use NFT marketplaces that ignore royalties to save money—especially on expensive NFTs. This means:

Imagine working for months on an artwork only for it to be sold later without a single cent coming back to you. Ouch.

Let's be honest: not every NFT project is a forever success. Trends fade, collectors move on, and even the coolest JPEGs can lose their luster. That means:
            




For most, NFT royalties are not a set-it-and-forget-it retirement plan—they're a nice bonus while your work is hot.

So yes, NFT royalties can feel like magic, but the spell doesn't always last. Next up, we'll talk about what the future could look like—and whether there's still hope for creators looking to turn pixels into paychecks.





Alright, now we're heading into the land of laws, rights, and digital drama—because yes, even in the wild world of NFTs, the boring-but-important stuff like intellectual property and regulations still matter. Especially when we're talking about NFT royalties.

Just because someone buys your NFT doesn't mean they own the rights to your actual artwork. Confused? Here's the simple version:

This becomes super important if someone starts selling T-shirts with your art or making spin-offs. Without clear copyright terms in the NFT metadata or contract, things can get messy fast.

Even with smart contracts, NFT royalties can lead to disagreements:

These things happen more than you'd think. The decentralized nature of the space means enforcement is often left up to platforms or—worse—Twitter drama and community outrage.

Right now, the NFT space is kind of like the internet in the '90s: exciting, chaotic, and mostly unregulated. But that won't last forever.

Governments and regulators are starting to take notes:

For creators, this could be good news—especially if future laws help lock in royalties as a right, not just a nice-to-have.

So you're ready to ride the NFT wave like a pro surfer, and you've got your sights set on those sweet NFT royalties. Awesome! But before you start counting passive income in your sleep, let's go over a few smart strategies to help you actually get paid—and keep the good vibes going.

You can set your royalty percentage when minting an NFT—usually between 2.5% and 10% of every resale. But the golden rule?

Remember: the royalty is a thank-you, not a tollbooth.

Not all marketplaces play by the same rules. Some platforms proudly honor NFT royalties. Others? Not so much.

Here are a few with a rep for respecting creators:

Hot tip: Check the fine print (or community chatter) before committing to any platform. Some newer “zero-fee” platforms are also “zero-royalty,” which isn't great if you're counting on long-term income.

Look, NFT royalties are great when they come in—but they're not always a steady paycheck. To stay financially healthy in Web3 (or anywhere), it's smart to diversify.

Here's how:

Royalties are one piece of the puzzle—but your creativity? That's the real goldmine.

With these tips in your digital toolkit, you'll be better equipped to build a royalty strategy that's fair, future-proof, and financially sane. Next up: let's peek into what the future holds for NFT royalties. Will they stick around—or are they just a shiny phase in Web3 history?

Let's bring it home. NFT royalties have opened up an exciting new world where artists and creators can finally earn from their work long after the first sale. The idea of passive income sounds amazing—who wouldn't want to keep making money every time their art changes hands? But here's the reality check: while NFT royalties can provide ongoing earnings, they're not always enforced, the market can be unpredictable, and the legal side is still catching up.

That doesn't mean creators should ignore them—far from it. Royalties are still a powerful tool in the digital creator's kit. Just don't treat them as a guaranteed income stream. Think of them as one ingredient in a bigger recipe. If you're smart about platforms, fair with your royalty rates, and open to multiple income sources, NFT royalties can absolutely work in your favor—just maybe not forever on their own.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Dapp and NFT on the rise: TVL at $200 Billion, NFT Growing by 40%, and the Rise of AI in Web3","https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2025/06/06/dapp-and-nft-on-the-rise-tvl-at-200-billion-nft-growing-by-40-and-the-rise-of-ai-in-web3/","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 09:57:32 GMT","

May 2025 marks a turning point for the entire Web3 ecosystem. According to the new Dapp Industry Report by DappRadar, we witness a significant recovery in several verticals: DeFi, NFT, and AI show concrete signs of consolidation and growth. 

With 25 million daily active wallets, a 25% growth in DeFi TVL, and a 40% increase in NFT trading volume, the narrative is changing: from cyclical speculations to a concrete, mature, and distributed use of dapps.

Summary

The report highlights how the number of daily active unique wallets (dUAW) increased by 8% compared to April, reaching 25 million. This widespread growth reflects a renewed enthusiasm from users, driven by three main sectors:

We are entering a phase in which DeFi, Gaming, and AI compete for users' attention on an equal basis. A balance that, as highlighted by DappRadar, represents an important sign of maturity for the entire sector.

Among the emerging trends, InfoFi also stands out, the movement that is leading to the “financialization” of data in a Web3 context. A trend that will see more and more users, AI agents, and protocols exchange data, models, and insights as true financial assets, leveraging blockchain and transparency.

If April was dominated by the memecoin mania (Pump.fun above all), in May there was an transition from hype to utility. Some emblematic cases:

In summary, the dapps that are growing the most today are not those based on speculation, but those that solve real problems: from smart communications to scalable decentralized finance, including gaming with persistent identities.

The DeFi has recorded one of the best performances in recent months, with a TVL increasing by 25% bringing the total to about 200 billion dollars. The credit goes partly to the rally of Ethereum (+40%) and Bitcoin (new ATH), but also to significant infrastructural developments.

The most surprising dapp is Hyperliquid, a DEX that has reached a monthly trading volume of $244 billion, capturing 10% of Binance's market share. With these figures, it enters the world's top 5 for trading volume, surpassing numerous centralized exchanges.

DeFi is thus structuring itself as a concrete alternative to the CeFi world, strengthened by technical updates, regulatory clarity, and renewed investor trust.

With 4.8 million daily active users, AI dapps are now reassessing the AI narrative in Web3. SubHub is the most emblematic case, but the report also highlights widespread growth:

According to a Harris poll commissioned by Digital Currency Group:

A data point that strengthens the synergy between Web3 and artificial intelligence: users and investors demand transparency, ownership, and alternatives to tech monopolies.

The NFTs are growing again, with $280 million in volume (+40%) and 2.7 million transactions (+35%). But is it a real recovery or just a temporary spike?

Among the most significant events:

The sector remains partly tied to incentive mechanisms (airdrop and farming), but the signs of an evolution towards utility and mobile scalability are concrete.

Despite fewer incidents compared to April, May saw $275 million lost in just 7 attacks, making it the 3rd worst month of the year.

Security remains one of the main vulnerabilities of the sector. There is a need for more stringent audits, real-time monitoring tools, and greater technical education for developers and users.

The DappRadar report shows a more mature, balanced, and innovative Web3. After turbulent months, the fundamentals are returning to the forefront:

The sector is shifting from volatile experimentation to building robust infrastructure. The future of dapps will be determined by utility, interoperability, scalability, and security.

And as the report highlights: “It is no longer just a matter of hype, but of fundamentals”.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","UK ICO publishes AI and biometrics strategy","https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366625476/UK-ICO-publishes-AI-and-biometrics-strategy","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 11:41:15 GMT","

THAWEERAT - stock.adobe.com

The UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has launched an artificial intelligence (AI) and biometrics strategy, which the regulator says will support innovation while protecting people's data rights.

Published on 5 June 2025, the strategy highlights how the ICO will focus its efforts on technology use cases where most of the risks are concentrated, but where there is also “significant potential” for public benefit.

This includes the use of automated decision-making (ADM) systems in recruitment and public services, the use of facial recognition by police forces, and the development of AI foundation models.

Specific actions outlined for these areas include conducting audits and producing guidance on the “lawful, fair and proportionate” use of facial recognition by police, setting “clear expectations” for how people's personal data can be used to train generative AI models, and developing a statutory code of practice for organisations' use of AI.

The regulator added it would also consult on updating guidance for ADM profilers, working specifically with early adopters such as the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), and produce a horizon scanning report on the implications of agentic AI that is increasingly capable of acting autonomously.

“The same data protection principles apply now as they always have – trust matters, and it can only be built by organisations using people's personal information responsibly,” said information commissioner John Edwards at the launch of the strategy. “Public trust is not threatened by new technologies themselves, but by reckless applications of these technologies outside of the necessary guardrails.”

The strategy also outlined how – because “we consistently see public concern” around transparency and explainability, bias and discrimination, and rights and redress – these are areas where the regulator will focus its efforts.

On AI models, for example, the ICO said it will “secure assurances” from developers around how they are using people's personal information so people are aware, while for police facial recognition, it said it will publish guidance clarifying how it can be deployed lawfully.

Police facial recognition systems will also be audited, with the findings published to assure people that the systems are being well governed and their rights are being protected.

“Artificial intelligence is more than just a technology change – it is a change in society. It will increasingly change how we get healthcare, attend school, travel and even experience democracy,” said Dawn Butler, vice-chair of the AI All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), at the strategy's launch. “But AI must work for everyone, not just a few people, to change things. And that involves putting fairness, openness and inclusion into the underpinnings.”

Lord Clement-Jones, co-chair of the AI APPG, added: “The AI revolution must be founded on trust. Privacy, transparency and accountability are not impediments to innovation – they constitute its foundation. AI is advancing rapidly, transitioning from generative models to autonomous systems. However, increased speed introduces complexity. Complexity entails risk. We must guarantee that innovation does not compromise public trust, individual rights, or democratic principles.”

According to the ICO, negative perceptions of how AI and biometrics are deployed risks hampering their uptake, noting that trust in particular is needed for people to support or engage with these technologies, or the services powered by them.

It noted that public concerns are particularly high when it comes to police biometrics, the use of automated algorithms by recruiters, and the use of AI to determine people's eligibility for welfare benefits.

“In 2024, just 8% of UK organisations reported using AI decision-making tools when processing personal information, and 7% reported using facial or biometric recognition. Both were up only marginally from the previous year,” said the regulator.  

“Our objective is to empower organisations to use these complex and evolving AI and biometric technologies in line with data protection law. This means people are protected and have increased trust and confidence in how organisations are using these technologies.

“However, we will not hesitate to use our formal powers to safeguard people's rights if organisations are using personal information recklessly or seeking to avoid their responsibilities. By intervening proportionately, we will create a fairer playing field for compliant organisations and ensure robust protections for people.”

In late May 2025, an analysis by the Ada Lovelace Institute found that “significant gaps and fragmentation” in the existing “patchwork” governance frameworks for biometric surveillance technologies means people's rights are not being adequately protected.

While the Ada Lovelace Institute's analysis focused primarily on deficiencies in UK policing's use of live facial recognition (LFR) technology – which it identified as the most prominent and highly governed biometric surveillance use case – it noted there is a need for legal clarity and effective governance for “biometric mass surveillance technologies” across the board.

This includes other forms of biometrics, such as fingerprints for cashless payments in schools, or systems that claim to remotely infer people's emotions or truthfulness, as well as other deployment scenarios, such as when supermarkets use LFR to identify shoplifters or verification systems to assure people's ages for alcohol purchases.

Both Parliament and civil society have made repeated calls for new legal frameworks to govern UK law enforcement's use of biometrics.

This includes three separate inquiries by the Lords Justice and Home Affairs Committee (JHAC) into shoplifting, police algorithms and police facial recognition; two of the UK's former biometrics commissioners, Paul Wiles and Fraser Sampson; an independent legal review by Matthew Ryder QC; the UK's Equalities and Human Rights Commission; and the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee, which called for a moratorium on LFR as far back as July 2019

However, while most of these focused purely on police biometrics, the Ryder review in particular also took into account private sector uses of biometric data and technologies, such as in public-private partnerships and for workplace monitoring

Posted by Evie Kim Sing | Jun 6, 2025 | Artificial Intelligence, Biometrics, Verification and Authentication

AI regulation is stepping up to supervise new models that handle user's personal data and the UK's Information Commissioner's Office has unveiled a new three-year strategy to ensure its use is responsible and managing the threats to public trust. 

Launched at a 40th anniversary event in Parliament, the strategy sets out how the ICO will support innovation while ensuring personal data is used lawfully and responsibly. The public desire to be aware of the consequences if AI driven systems are misused and what impact this has on them. As AI is helping with everyday tasks and processes, the technology is embraced with some caution in case facial recognition technology is used inaccurately, or a flawed automated decision impacts a job application, for example. 

54% of people surveyed shared concerns about the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement for inspections and the infringement on their right to privacy. On the other hand, criminals with a known past history of convictions can quickly be detected in police systems with the use of biometrics data matching.

There is a fair balance to be struck which allows AI to bring new opportunities for organisations to innovative with AI and sell new capabilities bit people need to feel their personal information is in “safe hands”.

So AI technologies must be scrutinised whilst it is focused on accelerating economies. ICO's role as a regulator is to ensure “effective protections are in place, and personal information is used in ways that both drive innovation and earn people's trust.”

Key priorities include scrutinising automated decision-making in recruitment, auditing police use of facial recognition technology, and setting clear expectations for how generative AI systems are trained against standards. 

The regulator pledged to develop a statutory code of practice for AI and continue investigating emerging risks, including the rise of ‘agentic AI'.

The strategy has won backing from Parliamentarians. Dawn Butler MP said AI must be built on fairness and inclusion, while Lord Clement-Jones CBE warned that trust, privacy, and accountability must underpin innovation.

The ICO will also consult on updated ADM guidance and publish a horizon-scanning report on agentic AI later this year, reinforcing its commitment to ensuring that data protection keeps pace with technological change.

Solana's most viral app wants to raise $1 billion. But the crypto community isn't completely sold on the pitch.

Listen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pods, Fountain, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.

On Tuesday, a pseudonymous X account claimed that Pump.fun, Solana's breakout memecoin launchpad, would raise $1 billion via an ICO at a $4 billion valuation. The potential deal? Multiple CEX listings, a 10% community airdrop, and maybe even a launch by the end of the month.

The community reaction? Not great.

In this episode, Syncracy Capital's Ryan Watkins joins to break down the backlash, whether the raise makes sense, and what this kind of fundraising says about the current state of crypto.

He discusses:

Key Points

The Y2K bug never melted the global grid, yet the panic-buying of flashlights and canned beans in the last months of 1999 was very real. Today, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could be playing a similar role in a different fear cycle.

CBDCs are digital currencies issued and controlled by a central bank, combining the convenience of digital money with the potential for state oversight of transactions. Talk of state-issued, fully traceable (and controllable) digital money has some investors looking for a lifeboat, and the main beneficiary this time could be Bitcoin (BTC 0.98%).

If you think a large and fearful capital flight to Bitcoin driven by CBDCs is improbable in the near term, you aren't wrong. Nonetheless, it's undeniable that a centralized and government-controlled digital currency could threaten financial privacy in a way that encourages certain investors to hold their funds in another form. There's already some evidence that at least a few people are buying Bitcoin for this reason. Let's dig in and understand this trend a bit more so that you'll be prepared if it continues to take off.

China's recent push to expand its digital yuan pilot projects is both a technical experiment and a catalyst for Chinese investors seeking to safeguard their financial privacy by seeking alternative currencies like Bitcoin. It's also a good example of how capital can behave in a way that's beneficial to Bitcoin when central bankers start to posture regarding implementing CBDCs.

On April 23, the People's Bank of China urged state-owned enterprises to prioritize using the yuan for cross-border payments; the digital yuan is likely going to be promoted next. That move sent a clear message: The Chinese government is accelerating control over money and its flows, thereby spurring underground over-the-counter (OTC) purchasing of Bitcoin in cities like Shenzhen and Shanghai as investors scrambled to move capital offshore.

The dynamic echoes early 2023, when the start of one of China's digital yuan pilot programs coincided with a 72% surge in Bitcoin's price from January to April, reflecting a classic flight to a perceived safe asset. With around 94% of central banks now exploring CBDCs, according to data from the Bank of International Settlements, the same impulse that's driving Chinese investors to Bitcoin could very easily spread internationally.

In the U.S., CBDC conversations are a mix of cautious exploration and staunch political resistance.

The Federal Reserve's research into a digital dollar is ongoing. Yet on Capitol Hill, resistance is mounting. A bill reintroduced in late February seeks to bar the Fed from issuing a CBDC.

Furthermore, President Donald Trump's executive order on Jan. 28 bans a ""digital dollar"" outright, but that could actually spur CBDCs in other countries, as they'll be free to establish any norms they prefer for the currency category. So, U.S. investors aren't exactly afraid of a new CBDC threatening their privacy or control over their funds. However, they could still capture the upside from investors in other countries buying Bitcoin to evade their nations' CBDCs.

At the moment, capital flight into Bitcoin as a result of CBDCs is a trend that's just starting to pick up. Still, it's important to keep expectations in check here. Bitcoin probably can't ever replace fiat currencies completely, whether they're digitized or not.

Bitcoin's supply is famously capped at 21 million coins. That scarcity can support price strength until the cows come home. But there are many technical hurdles to using Bitcoin as an actual currency rather than merely as a store of value. Everyday transactions are far too slow or too costly to be competitive with cash, even on throughput-specialized side chains like the Lightning network.

So while the CBDC debate may push Bitcoin higher to the extent it persists and intensifies, don't expect a one-way rocket ride. Investors can count on a tailwind here as long as privacy fears persist. Still, there's no wholly new reason to invest in Bitcoin any more than you're already doing, unless you want to avoid using a CBDC in the future.

Attempted abductions of ‘crypto tycoons' are becoming more frequent and insurance companies are cashing in.

Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan was renting a luxury New York townhouse for $40,000 a month, enjoying the fruits of his highly lucrative investments in cryptocurrency. But in May, his 17-room Manhattan home became a torture chamber in which he was held by kidnappers for 17 days.

Carturan's captors, John Woeltz and William Duplessie, who wanted access to his cryptocurrency accounts, used brutal methods in their bid to prise open Carturan's Bitcoin wallet, purportedly containing some $28m worth of cryptocurrency. Among other torture methods, they hung him from the building's roof, shocked him with electrical wires and threatened him with a chainsaw.

When all else failed, they forced him to smoke crack cocaine. Ultimately, they were unsuccessful. After more than two gruelling weeks, Carturan managed to escape the townhouse and Woeltz and Duplessie were subsequently arrested and charged with kidnapping and assault.

Carturan's ordeal was one of the latest in a spate of “wrench attacks”, which include so-called “crypto kidnappings”, combining high-tech cybertheft with old-fashioned thuggery and have been taking place in several countries around the world.

Yes. On May 31, 26 people were charged for several attempted kidnappings of a top figure in France's cryptocurrency world, French prosecutors said.

It was the culmination of a police investigation into an “attempted kidnapping by an organised gang” of the daughter and grandson of the CEO of crypto firm Paymium in Paris on May 13, and “other unsuccessful plans”, a failed attempt on the same targets the day before, and another attempt near the western city of Nantes on June 2.

“Eighteen people have been placed in pre-trial detention, three have requested a deferred hearing, and four have been placed under judicial supervision,” the Paris public prosecutor's office said, concerning the Paris attack. The suspects are all aged between 16 and 23.

France has been the centre of several attacks on prominent crypto entrepreneurs in recent months. But crypto-linked kidnappings have occurred in other countries, too.

In addition to the recent attempted abductions in Paris, a group of criminals kidnapped David Balland, cofounder of the cryptocurrency firm Ledger, and his wife in central France in January.

In a particularly gruesome turn of events, the kidnappers cut off one of Balland's fingers and sent the video of the mutilation to Ledger. Within two days, however, the French gendarmerie had freed both victims.

Nine suspects are under criminal investigation in that case.

In December 2024, the wife of crypto investor and influencer Stephane Winkel was kidnapped from the couple's home in Belgium. She was rescued after her kidnapper crashed his car during a dramatic police chase.

Canada and Australia have also witnessed high-profile kidnappings, with crypto executives and traders abducted and forced to pay ransoms ranging from $40,000 to $1m in digital assets.

It is unclear whether the recent spate of crypto kidnappings is connected in any way.

Bitcoin, which began trading in January 2009, was the very first cryptocurrency. This form of monetary exchange allows people to bypass central banks and traditional payment methods. It is now a functioning, decentralised monetary system, with hundreds of millions of users worldwide.

Bitcoin was first used in a transaction in 2009, valued at just $0.004 per Bitcoin. Yesterday, Bitcoin's price closed at nearly $101,576 per Bitcoin – about 53 percent higher than a year ago, and nearly 2.5 trillion percentage points higher than in 2009.

Initially, the digital currency was favoured by internet libertarians who were drawn to the idea that money should be free from government interference. It quickly gained more mainstream popularity, and the price has shot up.

More recently, United States President Donald Trump has taken steps to mint several cryptocurrencies, meaning they would be included in a “Crypto Strategic Reserve”, boosting their price even more in the process.

While cryptocurrency thefts are nothing new, they have historically involved hacking digital accounts holding large sums of the currency. In 2022, for instance, internet thieves stole an estimated $570m from Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange.

But as Bitcoin and other digital assets continue to climb in value, criminals are shifting their efforts from online hacking to real-world extortion, via kidnappings and torture.

 



 

Victims are not hard to find.

Some crypto tycoons, many of whom are young men, have a habit of flaunting their wealth on social media or by appearing at cryptocurrency conferences, which allows criminals to easily identify targets.

Many have continued to flaunt their wealth in spite of the 2016 Kim Kardashian kidnapping incident. The US reality TV star was tied up in her hotel room in Paris as robbers made off with millions of dollars worth of jewellery. The men – dubbed the “grandpa robbers” because of their ages – were later caught and sentenced to prison by a French court.

That was not a crypto attack, but as more crypto tycoons have appeared, there is little to differentiate them from the fabulously wealthy like the Kardashians.

Even those with large crypto wealth who are more cautious about displaying their wealth on social media and in public have been exposed to criminal activity via data breaches at cryptocurrency exchanges, however.

In May 2025, Coinbase Global announced that hackers had managed to obtain personal information, including the home addresses of almost 70,000 customers in the previous few months, putting thousands at risk of attack or extortion.

Besides hacking the accounts of crypto millionaires for this sort of information, criminals have also bribed insiders at crypto exchanges for customer data. This information is then used to select and find high-value targets for kidnappings or home invasions.

It is easier to steal money from a digital wallet than from a traditional bank account, and kidnapping is one way to do this.

Attackers simply need to gain access to someone's cryptocurrency account password, as there's no third-party financial institution to protect the funds held in the digital wallet.

Transactions on an open-ledger blockchain – the technology which facilitates cryptocurrencies – are also permanent, meaning transactions are irreversible.

And, unlike cash, jewellery and gold, thieves don't need to carry away the stolen cryptocurrency with them. With a few clicks, money can simply be moved from one account to another.

Furthermore, cryptocurrency's ability to skirt traditional law enforcement also means it is much easier to launder, making it popular with internet-based drug dealers.

Therefore, if criminals can force a victim to give up their account, they can gain immediate access to vast wealth – hence the rise in physical attacks and kidnappings.

 



 

Yes, you can. At least three insurance companies which provide services for cryptocurrency investors are in the process of designing policies specifically for abductions, called kidnap and ransom (K&R) policies, according to a report by NBC News.

Becca Rubenfeld, chief operating officer at AnchorWatch – a crypto insurance firm aiming to launch K&R protection later this year – said that fear of violence was a key talking point at this year's annual Las Vegas Bitcoin Conference, in May.

“They're [cryptocurrency holders are] tense,” Rubenfeld told NBC. “I'm not saying that because I'm trying to sell insurance, but overall, the mood is a very good environment for me.”

Kidnapping and ransom insurance is not uncommon for high-profile corporate executives.

Elsewhere, security experts are urging investors to avoid sharing details of their crypto holdings online, even with friends, and to use pseudonyms and new digital wallet addresses for each transaction.

Increasingly, crypto traders are avoiding making social media posts with geotagged photos, especially any that show themselves with luxury items, or revealing their travel plans.

MOSES LAKE — A 71-year-old Moses Lake man has fallen victim to a costly cryptocurrency scam, losing approximately $70,000 after responding to a fraudulent email, according to a report from the Moses Lake Police Department.

The man told police he received an email warning that his digital wallet was insecure. Believing the alert to be legitimate, he clicked on a link in the email and submitted his login information. Later, he discovered that his digital wallet had either been emptied or his cryptocurrency stolen.

Officers documented the incident but say there is little local law enforcement can do in this case. The fraudulent email is no longer accessible and the source remains unknown. Authorities advised the man to report the theft to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), which handles online fraud at the federal level.

The victim will be following up with officers after contacting the digital currency companies involved.

Police continue to remind the public to be wary of unsolicited emails or messages requesting personal information, especially involving financial accounts or digital assets.","{'href': 'https://www.yoursourceone.com', 'title': 'Source ONE News'}","cryptocurrency"

...

(Reuters) -Crypto firm Gemini said on Friday it had confidentially filed for a U.S. initial public offering, as digital asset companies move to tap into renewed investor risk appetite amid improving market conditions.

Several high-profile companies, including those in high-risk sectors such as crypto and financial technology, have launched successful listings in recent weeks, reflecting pent-up demand.

Earlier this week, stablecoin issuer Circle went public in a blowout debut on the New York Stock Exchange.

Analysts said Circle's successful debut could encourage more cryptocurrency firms to pursue public listings, adding that the trajectory is likely to embolden others eyeing stock market debuts.

Gemini said it had not yet determined the size and proposed price range for its offering.

Apple, Airbnb, Google and Elon Musk's X are holding early discussions with crypto companies about integrating stablecoins into their payment systems, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke with Fortune.



The tech giants see stablecoins as a way to cut transaction costs and streamline international payments. Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, offering a bridge between crypto infrastructure and traditional finance. In 2024, they facilitated more than $27.6 trillion in transactions — more than Visa and Mastercard combined — according to a report from the World Economic Forum.



Stablecoins have been a fast-growing area of interest for traditional finance and that appears to be exploding even further following stablecoin issuer Circle's (CRCL) gangbuster IPO on Thursday, Shares more than doubled from an already-raised offering price and they're higher by another 40% today.



According to Fortune, Apple has reportedly been in talks with crypto companies since January to explore incorporating stablecoins into Apple Pay and its wider payments infrastructure. Meanwhile, X is in discussions with Stripe to potentially enable stablecoin-based transactions.



Airbnb is exploring stablecoins as a way to reduce the cut it pays to card networks like Visa and Mastercard. One crypto executive told Fortune the home-rental giant has been in talks with Worldpay since the beginning of 2025.



Political shifts, primarily U.S. President Donald Trump's return to office — has made adopting crypto less risky in the U.S. corporate landscape.



Some analysts predict the stablecoin market could hit $2 trillion by 2028. One key tailwind: the expected passage of the GENIUS Act, a bill that would establish regulatory clarity for stablecoin issuers and potentially encourage more mainstream adoption in the United States.

A late-night Twitter spat between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk sparked fresh uncertainty in global markets, sending major cryptocurrencies tumbling and wiping out nearly $1 billion in leveraged bets.

Bitcoin BTC$104,655.32 dropped below $101,000 overnight before bouncing modestly, with DOGE and ADA among the worst hit, down over 6% each in the past 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which tracks the largest crypto assets, shed over 5%.

Data from CoinGlass shows that traders lost $988 million in liquidations — of which $888 million were long positions — indicative of a wipeout in bullish positions.

Exchanges like Bybit and Binance saw the biggest hits, with Bybit alone accounting for nearly $354 million in liquidations.

The liquidations largely hit major tokens, with bitcoin leading the pack at over $342 million liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data.

Ether ETH$2,492.51 followed with $286 million, reflecting the sharp sell-offs across the broader market.

Other tokens like Solana's SOL$149.84 and Dogecoin DOGE$0.17965 saw $51 million and $27 million liquidated, respectively, as altcoin traders found themselves on the wrong side of the sudden downturn.

XRP XRP$2.18 wasn't spared either, with $23 million in positions wiped out. The data also shows that high-leverage plays on memecoins, such as 1000PEPE, added to the volatility, as traders rushed to exit.

Liquidations to the forced closure of a trader's leveraged position when they can no longer meet the margin requirements. This typically occurs when the price of the underlying asset moves against their position, causing them to lose a large portion, or all, of their initial investment.

A cascade of liquidations often indicates market extremes, where a price reversal could be imminent as market sentiment overshoots in one direction.

The sell-off comes as Trump accused Musk of going “crazy” and threatened to terminate government contracts with his companies, while Musk lashed back by linking Trump to Jeffrey Epstein's files. 

The clash overshadowed what had been a mostly bullish trend for crypto markets in recent weeks, intensifying a profit-taking bout from the start of this week.

 While Bitcoin ETFs flipped to $278 million of outflows amid the Trump-Musk feud, Ether ETFs saw inflows, continuing a 14-day streak. 

Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States turned red amid worsening sentiment stemming from an ongoing feud between US President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk.

After a brief recovery on June 3-4, US spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs were again hit with outflows on June 5, totaling $278 million, according to SoSoValue data.

The outflows came as the Cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index flipped from “Greed” to “Fear” on June 6, likely in response to the rupture of the previously close relationship between Trump and Musk, which has played out in multiple explosive social media posts.

The sentiment shift is not exclusive to Bitcoin and crypto, with many investors spooked by the feud. Tesla (TSLA) shares plunged 14%, while Trump Media (DJT) shares dropped 8%, according to TradingView.

The latest outflows from US spot Bitcoin ETFs followed a two-day recovery coming after a series of outflows from May 29 to June 2, totaling $1.2 billion in just three trading days.

Global Bitcoin exchange-traded products have seen $8 million of outflows in the past trading week, while Ether (ETH) ETPs topped inflows at $321 million.

According to SoSoValue, ARK Invest's ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF(ARKB) led the exodus on June 5 with a massive $102 million in outflows. None of the funds saw inflows on that day.

While Bitcoin ETFs flipped to outflows amid the Trump-Musk feud, Ether ETFs continued to see inflows on Thursday.

According to SoSoValue, US spot Ether ETFs saw $11.3 million of inflows on June 5, marking 14 consecutive days of inflows. Still, yesterday's inflows were a noteworthy drop from $56.9 million of inflows on June 4 and $109.4 million of inflows on June 3.

Ether ETPs have attracted attention amid improving network fundamentals and resilient ETH futures markets.

 Bitcoin long traders took a hit over the past 24 hours amid Bitcoin's price dwindling amid broader macroeconomic tension and continued sell-offs by long-term holders. 

Investors who went long on Bitcoin saw significant losses over the past 24 hours as the cryptocurrency dipped nearly 3%, nearing a retest of the $100,000 level.

The price decline comes as the feud between US President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk intensifies, and those holding Bitcoin (BTC) for over 155 days keep selling to lock in profits.

Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin reached $105,915 before falling to $100,500 within a matter of hours, according to CoinMarketCap. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is holding at $102,180.

The drop caught traders offside, with approximately $308 million in long positions liquidated over the same period, according to CoinGlass.

It came alongside an escalation in Musk's public feud with Trump, with the Tesla boss taking to his X platform on June 5 to say that Trump's plan for sweeping global tariffs “will cause a recession in the second half of this year.”

Several crypto analysts share the same opinion. Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal previously told Cointelegraph there is a risk that US policymakers delay monetary easing until they get “hard data” on the impact of Trump's tariffs, which would risk a “growth slowdown.” 

Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform that terminating Musk's government subsidies and contracts would save “billions and billions of dollars” for the US government. 

Musk responded that “in light of the President's statement about cancellation of my government contracts, SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately,” a statement that he walked back hours later. 

SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft is currently the only US-made option for sending astronauts to space.

Meanwhile, an increasing number of long-term Bitcoin holders have been selling off their holdings after Bitcoin reached new all-time highs of $111,970 on May 22, according to crypto analytics firm Glassnode.

Glassnode said in a June 5 markets note that “with long-term holders gradually applying sell pressure, the probability of a short-term correction continues to build, particularly in the absence of a strong upside catalyst to push Bitcoin decisively above [$111,800].”

Meanwhile, other major cryptocurrencies also saw sharp declines over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) dropped 7.25%, XRP (XRP) fell 4.35% and Solana (SOL) slid 5.20%. 

Across the broader crypto market, total liquidations reached $982.55 million over the past 24 hours, with long positions accounting for $891.63 million of that amount.

 Chainalysis told WIRED that it tracked a $31 million Bitcoin donation to online black market Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht to a successor marketplace called Alphabay. 

A crypto wallet tied to the defunct dark web marketplace Alphabay was reportedly behind the donation of $31 million worth of Bitcoin to Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht, according to blockchain analysis.

Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis told WIRED in a June 5 report that it had tied the 300 Bitcoin (BTC) donated to Ulbrich earlier this month to Alphabay, a predecessor to Silk Road that operated from 2014 to 2017.

Chainalysis suggested that the funds came from a major vendor on the platform who would have had access to such substantial amounts.

“We have reasonable grounds to suspect that these funds originated in AlphaBay,” Chainalysis director of investigations Phil Larratt said. “Looking at the amount, that would suggest they came from someone who was possibly a vendor on AlphaBay back in the early days.”

Independent blockchain sleuth ZachXBT confirmed that the 300 Bitcoin did not come from Silk Road and noted suspicious patterns in how the donor moved the funds.

They used multiple mixing services to obscure the transaction trail and cashed out other cryptocurrencies in small amounts to avoid detection, which he suggested indicated criminal origins.

ZachXBT said on X that the donation appears to come from a “sketchy centralized mixing service,” called Jambler, whereas normal privacy enthusiasts use decentralized mixers such as Wasabi and the now-defunct Samourai.

The analysis suggested that the money was a “legitimate donation, but not legitimate funds,” ZachXBT told WIRED.

“Usage of multiple mixers, spreading out CEX [centralized exchange] deposits, etc, that is done typically if you are trying to avoid getting illicit funds frozen,” he said. 

Chainalysis was instrumental in the identification of AlphaBay-linked Bitcoin addresses, which played a key role in the takedown of the darknet marketplace in an investigation known as “Operation Bayonet” that spanned 2016 and 2017.

Any BTC held since then would have appreciated dramatically, potentially over 40-fold, but the identity of the donor and their motivation remain unknown. 

In January, US President Donald Trump fully pardoned Ross Ulbricht, who had been in prison for 12 years serving a double life sentence plus 40 years for running the Silk Road.

But it also makes the concept of time-traveling into alternate futures a reality.

Here's what you'll learn in this story:



What would the universe look like if you could travel faster than light? The answer may provide a surprising explanation to the mysteries of quantum mechanics.

Our universe plays by certain rules, which originate from different branches of physics. But sometimes the rules seem inconsistent with each other or don't quite line up. And in other cases the rules seem to come out of nowhere, without clear explanation. 

Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity is one set of rules that helps us understand the universe. This theory tells us that time and space are linked together in a four-dimensional fabric, called space-time, with three dimensions of space and one of time. Time is special because we can only move in the direction of our future, unlike the spatial dimensions, where we are free to move wherever we like. Plus, special relativity tells us that movement in space-time is limited to no faster than the speed of light, 380,000 feet per second.

Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, gives us rules about how subatomic systems work, those particles smaller than atoms. And those rules are very, very strange. For example, in quantum mechanics particles can seem to appear in multiple locations at once, and we are never exactly sure where a particle will end up. In fact, we've had to create an entire language called wave-particle duality to accommodate these rules. In this view, particles aren't really particles. Instead they are waves of probability that slosh around. Where the waves peak, we have a good chance of finding the particle the next time we go looking for it. And where the waves are at their minimum, we are unlikely to see that particle.

These rules of quantum mechanics also allow for seemingly contradictory behavior like quantum entanglement, where one particle can influence another instantaneously—blowing well past the speed of light limit from special relativity.

In an effort to tackle these issues, researchers from the Universities of Warsaw and Oxford asked an altogether different kind of question. What would the universe be like if you could travel faster than light? Now in special relativity it's impossible to move from below the speed of light and accelerate to reach it, let alone go faster than light. But the rules of special relativity also allow the reverse situation, where objects can start off faster than light already—but then they can never slow down below that limit. 

According to the researchers, for observers who are already traveling faster than light, the connection between time and space is flipped. Instead of three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension, faster than light observers see three dimensions of time and only a single dimension of space. This means that particles follow more than one trajectory at once. In effect, they travel into more than one future simultaneously.

From our normal slower-than-the-speed-of-light perspective, it looks like these faster-than-light objects are not behaving like particles at all. Instead, they act like waves. Think about it. If you throw a baseball it only follows one path. But if the baseball hits a nearby pond, the water waves travel in multiple directions at once.

The researchers argue that this shift in perspective offers a possible explanation for the mysteries of quantum mechanics. Things like quantum entanglement, random probabilities, wave-particle duality, and all the other usual consequences of quantum mechanics seem to be natural outgrowths of this faster-than-light perspective. Instead of springing into existence without explanation—which is the default mode in quantum mechanics—these rules now have a potential reason. 

Indeed, the researchers point out that the concept of a particle in this perspective completely breaks down. Instead you can only talk about fields, which are waves that exist throughout all of space and time. The researchers point out that many theories in physics, especially ideas concerning the fundamental physics occurring in the extremely early universe, already employ fields that have faster-than-light properties.

However, whether or not the individual particles known as tachyons can travel faster than light remains an open question. That's because the existence of such particles would really mess up basic concepts in the universe, like causality and the progression from past to future that we are familiar with. But quantum mechanics already stretches those concepts, so it's possible that the universe already runs on these non-intuitive rules. Perhaps we just need to make the connection.

Quantum materials exhibit remarkable emergent properties when they are excited by external sources. However, these excited states decay rapidly once the excitation is removed, limiting their practical applications. A team of researchers from Harvard University and the Paul Scherrer Institute PSI have now demonstrated an approach to stabilize these fleeting states and probe their quantum behaviour using bright X-ray flashes from the X-ray free electron laser SwissFEL at PSI. The findings are published in the journal Nature Materials.

Some materials exhibit fascinating quantum properties that can lead to transformative technologies, from lossless electronics to high-capacity batteries. However, when these materials are in their natural state, these properties remain hidden, and scientists need to gently ask for them to pop up. One way they can do this is by using ultrashort pulses of light to alter the microscopic structure and electronic interactions in these materials so that these functional properties emerge. But good things do not last forever - these light-induced states are transient, typically persisting only a few picoseconds, making them difficult to harness in practical applications. In rare cases, light-induced states become long-lived. Yet our understanding of these phenomena remains limited, and no general framework exists for designing excited states that last.

A team of scientists from Harvard University together with PSI colleagues overcame this challenge by manipulating the symmetry of electronic states in a copper oxide compound. Using the X-ray free electron laser SwissFEL at PSI, they demonstrated that tailored optical excitation can induce a 'metastable' non-equilibrium electronic state persisting for several nanoseconds - about a thousand times longer than they usually last for.

Steering electrons with light

The compound under study, Sr14Cu24O41 -- a so-called cuprate ladder -- is nearly one-dimensional. It is composed of two distinct structural units, the so-called ladders and chains, representing the shape in which copper and oxygen atoms organize. This one-dimensional structure offers a simplified platform to understand complex physical phenomena that also show up in higher-dimensional systems. ""This material is like our fruit fly. It is the idealized platform that we can use to study general quantum phenomena,"" comments experimental condensed matter physicist Matteo Mitrano from Harvard University, who lead the study.

One way to achieve a long-lived ('metastable') non-equilibrium state is to trap it in an energy well from which it does not have enough energy to escape. However, this technique risks inducing structural phase transitions that change the material's molecular arrangement, and that is something Mitrano and his team wanted to avoid. ""We wanted to figure out whether there was another way to lock the material in a non-equilibrium state through purely electronic methods,"" explains Mitrano. For that reason, an alternative approach was proposed.

In this compound, the chain units hold a high density of electronic charge, while the ladders are relatively empty. At equilibrium, the symmetry of the electronic states prevents any movement of charges between the two units. A precisely engineered laser pulse breaks this symmetry, allowing charges to quantum tunnel from the chains to the ladders. ""It's like switching on and off a valve,"" explains Mitrano. Once the laser excitation is turned off, the tunnel connecting ladders and chains shuts down, cutting off the communication between these two units and trapping the system in a new long-lived state for some time that allows scientists to measure its properties.

Cutting-edge fast X-ray probes

The ultra-bright femtosecond X-ray pulses generated at the SwissFEL allowed the ultrafast electronic processes governing the formation and subsequent stabilization of the metastable state to be caught in action. Using a technique known as time-resolved Resonant Inelastic X-ray scattering (tr-RIXS) at the SwissFEL Furka endstation, researchers can gain unique insight into magnetic, electric, and orbital excitations - and their evolution over time - revealing properties that often remain hidden to other probes.

""We can specifically target those atoms that determine the physical properties of the system,"" comments Elia Razzoli, group leader of the Furka endstation and responsible for the experimental setup.

This capability was key to dissecting the light-induced electronic motion that gave rise to the metastable state. ""With this technique, we could observe how the electrons moved at their intrinsic ultrafast timescale and hence reveal electronic metastability,"" adds Hari Padma, postdoctoral scholar at Harvard and lead author of the paper.

The first of many more to come

tr-RIXS gives unique insight into energy and momentum dynamics of excited materials, opening new scientific opportunities for users of SwissFEL in studying quantum materials; indeed, these results come from the first experiment conducted by a user group at the new Furka endstation. It was the interest in the development of tr-RIXS at Furka that motivated the Harvard team to collaborate with scientists at PSI. ""It's a rare opportunity to get time on a machine where you can do these sorts of experiments,"" comments Mitrano.

Since this initial pilot experiment, the Furka endstation has undergone upgrades to improve the RIXS energy resolution, and it is ready to study new types of individual and collective excitations, such as lattice excitations. ""This experiment was very important to showcase the kind of experiments that we can carry out. The endstation and its instrumentation are already much better now, and we will keep improving it,"" concludes Razzoli.

This work represents a major step forward in controlling quantum materials far from equilibrium, with broad implications for future technologies. By stabilising light-induced non-equilibrium states, the study opens new possibilities for designing materials with tuneable functionalities. This could enable ultrafast optoelectronic devices, including transducers that convert electrical signals to light and vice versa -- key components for quantum communication and photonic computing. It also offers a pathway toward non-volatile information storage, where data is encoded in quantum states created and controlled by light.

Forecasting the short-term spread of an ongoing disease outbreak poses a challenge owing to the complexity of contributing factors, some of which can be characterized through interlinked, multi-modality variables, and the intersection of public policy and human behavior. Here we introduce PandemicLLM, a framework with multi-modal large language models (LLMs) that reformulates real-time forecasting of disease spread as a text-reasoning problem, with the ability to incorporate real-time, complex, non-numerical information. This approach, through an artificial intelligence–human cooperative prompt design and time-series representation learning, encodes multi-modal data for LLMs. The model is applied to the COVID-19 pandemic, and trained to utilize textual public health policies, genomic surveillance, spatial and epidemiological time-series data, and is tested across all 50 states of the United States for a duration of 19 months. PandemicLLM opens avenues for incorporating various pandemic-related data in heterogeneous formats and shows performance benefits over existing models.

A Japanese spacecraft has probably crashed on the Moon, the second failed landing attempt for Tokyo-based private firm ispace.

The HAKUTO-R Mission 2 (M2) lander — also called Resilience — began its landing sequence from a 100-kilometre-altitude orbit at 3.13am local time on 5 June. The craft was due to land near the centre of Mare Frigoris (Sea of Cold) at 4.17am. 

The ispace team said at a press conference that it lost contact with M2 when the craft was 192 metres above the Moon's surface and descending faster than expected. An attempt to reboot M2 was also unsuccessful.

M2 didn't receive measurements of the distance between itself and the lunar surface in time to slow down and reach its correct landing speed, the team said.

“It eventually slowed down, but not softly enough,” says Clive Neal, who studies the Moon at the University of Notre Dame in Indianapolis, US. He speculates that the failure was probably caused by a systems issue that wasn't identified and addressed during the M1 landing attempt. “It's something that I believe will definitely be fixable, because getting that close means there's a few tweaks that are going to be needed for the next one,” he adds.

If M2 had successfully landed on the lunar surface, the mission would have been the second time a commercial company had achieved the feat and a first for a non-US company. ispace's Mission 1 (M1) probably crashed during a landing attempt in April 2023.

Lunar landings are challenging. When M1 crashed, Ryo Ujiie, ispace's chief technology officer said the telemetry — which collects data on the craft's altitude and speed — estimated that M1 was on the surface when it wasn't, causing the lander to free fall.

Speaking to Nature last week, Ujiie said the company had addressed the telemetry issue with M2 and modified its software. “We also carefully selected how to approach the landing site,” he added.

Had M2 landed successfully, the craft would have supplied electricity for its cargo, including water electrolyzing equipment and a module for food production experiments — developed by Japan-based Takasago Thermal Engineering and biotechnology firm Euglena. A deep space radiation probe made by Taiwan's National Central University, and the 54-centimetre Tenacious rover were also be on board. The rover, created by ispace's European subsidiary in Luxemburg, was going to be released from the lander to collect imagery, location data and lunar sand known as regolith. Tenacious also carries a small red house made by Swedish artist Mikael Genberg.

Metrics details

Clinical decision-making in oncology is complex, requiring the integration of multimodal data and multidomain expertise. We developed and evaluated an autonomous clinical artificial intelligence (AI) agent leveraging GPT-4 with multimodal precision oncology tools to support personalized clinical decision-making. The system incorporates vision transformers for detecting microsatellite instability and KRAS and BRAF mutations from histopathology slides, MedSAM for radiological image segmentation and web-based search tools such as OncoKB, PubMed and Google. Evaluated on 20 realistic multimodal patient cases, the AI agent autonomously used appropriate tools with 87.5% accuracy, reached correct clinical conclusions in 91.0% of cases and accurately cited relevant oncology guidelines 75.5% of the time. Compared to GPT-4 alone, the integrated AI agent drastically improved decision-making accuracy from 30.3% to 87.2%. These findings demonstrate that integrating language models with precision oncology and search tools substantially enhances clinical accuracy, establishing a robust foundation for deploying AI-driven personalized oncology support systems.

The field of large language models (LLMs)1 has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years. Models such as GPT-4 (ref. 2) have demonstrated capabilities that closely mimic human reasoning and problem-solving abilities and have shown knowledge across various professional disciplines. In the medical field, for instance, GPT-4 has achieved a passing score on the United States Medical Licensing Examination and is able to provide detailed explanations for its responses3. In oncology, where clinical decision-making is increasingly complex, LLMs can serve as a rapid and reliable reference tool, for instance, by providing medical recommendation suggestions from official medical guidelines4. This capability could not only aid in daily decision-making processes but also educate oncologists to stay updated with the latest treatment recommendations.

However, similar to the medical domain itself, where doctors rely on information through speech, written text and imaging, the future of medical artificial intelligence (AI) is multimodal5. Recently, several such AI systems have been introduced6. Examples include models that analyze radiology images together with clinical data7 or integrate information from histopathology with genomic8 or text-based information9. These advancements have fueled anticipations for the advent of generalist multimodal AI systems10,11, characterized by their ability to concurrently analyze and reason across any dimension of medical information.

However, it remains to be investigated whether such generalist multipurpose AI models alone are suitable for medical applications. The distribution of human diseases is wide and complex, which is not captured in current performance benchmarks, where these models are predominantly evaluated on a single specific task at a time. In contrast, real-world clinical decision-making often requires multistep reasoning, planning and repeated interactions with data to uncover new insights to make informed and personalized decisions.

Despite advances with models such as Med-PaLM M11 or Med-Gemini12, the complexities to develop a generalist foundation LLM that truly performs on par with precision medicine tools remain a substantial challenge. Additionally, at present, regulatory policies in the United States and the European Union restrict the approval of a universal multipurpose AI model, given the philosophy that medical devices should fulfill a singular purpose13.

Previous work has shown that some of these limitations can partially be overcome by enriching LLMs with domain-specific information. This can be achieved through fine-tuning14 or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)15, a process that temporarily enhances an LLM's knowledge by incorporating relevant text excerpts from authoritative sources into the model, such as medical guidelines16 or textbooks. Yet, this strategy, concentrating on augmenting the knowledge base of the models, positions LLMs as mere information extraction tools only, rather than serving as true clinical assistants. Ideally, such a system would engage in reasoning, strategizing and performing actions on patient records and retrieve or synthesize new information to enable customized decision-making. Outside of the medical field, several such autonomous AI systems, also termed agents, have been proposed. Equipping an LLM with a suite of tools, such as calculators or web search, has proven superiority in tasks that require multistep reasoning and planning17,18. Similarly, in biomedical research, Arasteh et al. used the integrated data analysis tools of an LLM to analyze scientific data, achieving results on par with human researchers19. Such an approach would facilitate the opportunity of accessing the information repositories that currently exist in hospital systems, allowing for a true model for integrated patient care20.

In this study, we build and evaluate an AI agent tailored to interact with and draw conclusions from multimodal patient data through tools in oncology. Contrarily to the philosophy of an all-encompassing multimodal generalist foundation model, we see the achievements that specialist unimodal deep learning models have brought to precision medicine21 as a viable template even in the future by equipping an LLM, specifically GPT-4, with additional functions and resources. These could be precision oncology deep learning models or the ability to perform web search, all referred to herein as tools. Specifically, this study includes the vision model application programming interface (API) dedicated to generating radiology reports from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans, MedSAM22 for medical image segmentation and in-house developed vision transformer models trained to detect the presence of genetic alterations directly from routine histopathology slides23, in particular, to distinguish between tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI) and microsatellite stability (MSS)24 and to detect the presence or absence of mutations in KRAS and BRAF. Additionally, the system encompasses a basic calculator, capabilities for conducting web searches through Google and PubMed, as well as access to the precision oncology database OncoKB25. To ground the model's reasoning on medical evidence, we compile a repository of roughly 6,800 medical documents and clinical scores from a collection of six different official sources, specifically tailored to oncology.

To quantitatively test the performance of our proposed system, we devise a benchmark strategy on realistic, simulated patient case journeys. Existing biomedical benchmarks and evaluation datasets are designed for one or two data modalities26 and are restricted to closed question-and-answer formats. Recent advancements have been made with the introduction of new datasets by Zakka et al.16, targeting the enhancement of open-ended responses, and LongHealth27, focusing on patient-related content. Yet, these datasets are limited to text and do not capture multimodal data, such as the combination of CT or MRI images with microscopic and genetic data, alongside textual reports. Therefore, in the present study, we develop and assess our agent using a dataset comprising 20 realistic and multidimensional patient cases, which we generate with a focus on gastrointestinal oncology. For each patient case, the agent follows a two-stage process. Upon receiving the clinical vignette and corresponding questions, it autonomously selects and applies relevant tools to derive supplementary insights about the patient's condition, which is followed by the document retrieval step to base its responses on substantiated medical evidence, duly citing the relevant sources. To evaluate the results, we designed a blinded manual evaluation by four human experts, focusing on three areas: the agent's use of tools, the quality and completeness of the textual outputs and the precision in providing relevant citations. For effective tool application, the agent must first recognize the utility of a tool, comprehend the necessary inputs and then extract these inputs from the provided patient information. We provide an overview of our entire pipeline in Fig. 1. A detailed description of our methodology is provided in the Methods.

A schematic overview of our LLM agent pipeline. At its core, our system accesses a curated knowledge database comprising medical documents, clinical guidelines and scoring tools. This database is refined from a broader collection through keyword-based search, with the selected documents undergoing text embeddings for efficient storage and retrieval (1). The framework is further augmented with a suite of medical tools, including specialized web search capabilities through platforms such as Google, PubMed and access to the OncoKB API. The agent's capabilities are further expanded through the integration of a vision model tailored for generating detailed reports from CT and MRI scans, alongside MedSAM, a state-of-the-art medical image segmentation model and access to a simple calculator. Additionally, the system uses vision transformers specifically developed for the prediction of MSI versus MSS and the detection of KRAS and BRAF mutations in microscopic tumor samples (2). Given a simulated patient case, all tools are selected autonomously by the agent (3) with a maximum of ten per invocation and can be used either in parallel or in a sequential chain (4). This way, the agent can generate relevant patient information on demand and use this knowledge to query relevant documents within its database (4). This enables it to generate a highly specific and patient-focused response that integrates the initial clinical data with newly acquired insights, all while being substantiated by authoritative medical documentation (5).

Source data

To first demonstrate the superiority of combining medical tools and retrieval with an LLM, we compared our agent to GPT-4 alone. As an illustration, in Fig. 2a, we highlight three examples where tools and retrieval enabled the LLM to accurately solve cases, whereas, without these enhancements, GPT-4 either stated that it could not solve the patient case and provided hypothetical answers instead or drew incorrect conclusions, such as falsely assuming ‘disease progression' or ‘no evidence of disease' (in red). In contrast, the agent, by using tools, correctly identified treatment response and the presence of disease progression (in green). To quantify this, we assessed the model's ability to develop a comprehensive treatment plan for each patient, specifying appropriate therapies on the basis of recognizing disease progression, response or stability, mutational profile and all other relevant information, much like an oncologist would. Therefore, we compiled a set of 109 statements (completeness) for 20 different patient cases. We show that GPT-4 alone only provided 30.3% of the expected answers. However, our agent's responses achieved a 87.2% success rate, with only 14 instances not being covered (Fig. 2b). Overall, our results demonstrate that enhancing LLMs with tools drastically improves their ability to generate precise solutions for complex, realistic medical cases instead of providing only generic or even wrong responses when using LLMs in an out-of-the-box manner.

a, Top, to demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to a standard LLM, we highlight three cases where GPT-4 without tool use either fails to detect the current state of the disease for a given patient or provides very generic responses. Bottom, in contrast, tool access and retrieval enable the model to provide detailed information, such as measuring tumor surface and making appropriate decisions. b, The performance comparison shows a higher fraction of responses being evaluated as complete on our completeness benchmark for the agent with tool use and RAG versus GPT-4 alone.

Source data

We next investigated the overall capabilities and limitations of our agent across a panel of benchmarks in greater depth. To provide better guidance, we present one complete, simulated patient case and detail every step, from input over tool usage to the model's final output in Fig. 3. All tasks for the model and all answers are shown in Supplementary Note 1.

The full agent's pipeline for the simulated patient X, showcasing the complete input process and the collection of tools deployed by the agent. We abridge the patient description for readability (* …). The complete text is available in Supplementary Note 1. a,b, In the initial ‘tools' phase, the model identifies tumor localization from patient data and uses MedSAM for the generation of segmentation masks. Measuring the area of the segmented region enables the calculation of tumor progression over time as the model calculates an increase by a factor of 3.89. The agent also references the OncoKB database for mutation information from the patient's context (BRAFV600E and CD74–ROS1) and performs literature searches through PubMed and Google. For histological modeling, we must note here that we streamlined the processing. The original STAMP pipeline consists of two steps, where the first is the timely and computationally intensive calculation of feature vectors, which we performed beforehand for convenience. The second step is performed by the agent by selecting targets of interest and the location of the patient's data and executing the respective vision transformer (**). c, The subsequent phase involves data retrieval through RAG and the production of the final response.

Source data

First, we evaluated the agent's ability to recognize and successfully use tools (Fig. 4). Of 64 required tool invocations to fully solve all given patient cases, the agent correctly used 56, achieving an overall success rate of 87.5%, with no failures among the required tools. The remaining 12.5% of tools were required but missed by the model. There were two instances where the model tried to call superfluous tools without the necessary data available, which resulted in failures (Fig. 4, ‘tool use'). We provide an overview of each tool's invocation status in Supplementary Table 1. To provide an illustrative example, in the patient case from Fig. 3, GPT-4 used its tools to evaluate the patient's conditions by first identifying tumor localization from patient data and generating segmentation masks with MedSAM. It calculated tumor progression by measuring the segmented area's growth and referenced the OncoKB database for mutation information. The model then performed literature searches and histological modeling to select targets of interest, ultimately producing the final response through data retrieval with RAG.

Results from benchmarking the LLM agent through manual evaluation conducted by a panel of four medical experts. a–c, Steps in the agent's workflow as outlined in Fig. 3. For the metric ‘tool use', we report four ratios: represents the proportion of tools that were expected to be used to solve a patient case and that ran successfully (56/64), with no failures among the required tools. Required/unused (8/64) are tools that the LLM agent did not use despite being considered necessary. Additionally, there are two instances where a tool that was not required was used, resulting in failures. ‘Correctness' (223/245), ‘wrongness' (16/245) and ‘harmfulness' (6/245) represent the respective ratios of accurate, incorrect (yet not detrimental) and damaging (harmful) responses relative to the total number of responses. Here, a response is constituted by individual paragraphs per answer. ‘Completeness' (95/109) measures the proportion of experts' expected answers, as predetermined by keywords, that the model accurately identifies or proposes. ‘Helpfulness' quantifies the ratio of subquestions the model actually answers to all questions or instructions given by the user (63/67). Lastly, we measure whether a provided reference is correct (194/257), irrelevant (59/257, where the reference's content does not mirror the model's statement) or wrong (4/257). Results shown here are obtained from the majority vote across all observers, selecting the least favorable response in cases of a tie.

Source data

We additionally benchmarked GPT-4 against two state-of-the-art open-weights models, Llama-3 70B (Meta)28 and Mixtral 8x7B (Mistral)29, for which we show exemplary results in Fig. 5a and quantitative evaluations in Fig. 5b. We provide results for each patient in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3. Given substantial shortcomings in the latter two, we decided to only focus on GPT-4 as it demonstrated reliable and highly effective performance in identifying relevant tools and applying them correctly to patient cases.

a, Example tool results from three state-of-the-art LLMs (Llama-3, Mixtral and GPT-4). While the former two demonstrate failures in calling tools (or performing meaningless superfluous calculations in the case of Llama), GPT-4 successfully uses image segmentation on the MRI images and uses the calculator to calculate tumor changes in size. b, Tool benchmarking calling performance for these three models in a similar fashion to Fig. 4. Overall, our findings reveal that both open-weight models demonstrate only extremely poor function-calling performance. First, both models struggle to identify necessary tools for a given patient context (18.8% of required tools remain unused by Llama and even 42.2% for Mistral). Next, even in instances where the correct tool was identified, the model frequently failed to supply the necessary and accurate function arguments (‘required, failed'). This deficiency results in invalid requests that disrupt program functionality (Llama, 42.2%; Mixtral, 50.0%), ultimately leading to crashes. We saw none of these cases for GPT-4. Consequently, for Llama and Mixtral, the overall success rates were low, registering only 39.1% (Llama) and 7.8% (Mixtral) (‘required, successful'). Moreover, we saw that the Llama model frequently used superfluous tools, for example, performing random calculations on nonsense values or hallucinating (inventing) tumor locations during imaging analysis that did not exist. This led to 62 unnecessary tool calls and failures (‘not required, failed') across all 20 patient cases evaluated. The major shortcoming of the Mixtral model was its frequent disregard for tool use, resulting in fewer than one in ten tools running successfully.

Source data

Additionally, we observed that GPT-4 is capable of chaining sequential tool calls, using the output from one tool as input for the next. For example, in the tool results for patient G in Supplementary Note 2, GPT-4 invoked the MedSAM tool twice to obtain segmentation masks from two images taken at different time points. Subsequently, GPT-4 used the calculator function with the appropriate values from MedSAM to determine that the tumor had grown by a factor of 2.14. As another example, for patient W (Supplementary Note 2), the model used vision transformer models to assess the patient's mutational status, confirming the presence of a suspected BRAF mutation. The model then queried the OncoKB database to retrieve medical information on appropriate management regarding the mutation.

Additionally, we assessed the robustness of the agent across multiple repetitions and diverse patient populations, specifically considering different combinations in sex (Extended Data Fig. 1a), age (Extended Data Fig. 1b) and origin (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Our evaluation showed that the primary source of performance variation was the number of tools required for each patient case, rather than intrinsic patient factors (Extended Data Fig. 1d).

In summary, we can demonstrate that GPT-4 can effectively manage complex scenarios by sequentially using multiple tools, integrating their results and drawing informed conclusions on subsequent tool usage on the basis of prior information.

Second, we investigated the use of radiology processing tools by the agent. In our scenario, GPT-4 had two options: using the GPT-4 Vision (GPT-4V) API to generate comprehensive radiology reports (useful when no radiology report was provided for a patient) or using MedSAM for image segmentation to generate surface segmentation masks of the described tumor reference lesions when localizations of reference lesions were included in the patient case vignette. For both options, the model first had to identify the location where the images were stored on the filesystem, extract the order in which the images were taken (by date, indicated in the image file names) and send them to the appropriate tool. In our evaluations, we found that, despite occasional omissions, extraneous details, lack of information or making mistakes (highlighted in red in Supplementary Note 2), GPT-4V could nonetheless effectively guide the agent's decision.

Similarly, for MedSAM as a tool, the expected workflow for GPT-4 involved first locating the relevant patient images on the system, identifying their chronological order and receiving the locations of described reference lesions from the patient case vignette. After sending a request to MedSAM and receiving the results (tumor segmentation sizes), the model was usually expected to use the calculator to determine the percentage change according to RECIST criteria. This process is schematically illustrated in Fig. 3, with a detailed example provided in Supplementary Note 2 for patient G. We show that, in all instances, MedSAM received information on all relevant tumor locations and returned results that were helpful to GPT-4 to determine the appropriate next steps on the basis of calculating whether the patient showed progressive disease or remained in a stable condition.

In summary, we show that our pipeline is able to autonomously handle multiple steps, such as determining the need for specific tools, locating the relevant data, understanding their chronological order, sending requests to the appropriate tool, receiving results and integrating these into the next steps of its decision-making, for instance, using a calculator to compare tumor sizes over time. All of these steps are managed fully autonomously, without human supervision, by the LLM agent.

Thirdly, a central point in our analysis was the assessment of response accuracy (correctness). To evaluate this, we segmented the responses into smaller, evaluable items on the basis of the appearance of citations or transitions in topic within subsequent sentences, resulting in a total of 245 assessable statements. Our evaluations found 223 (91.0%) of these to be factually correct and 16 (6.5%) to be incorrect, while 6 (2.4%) were flagged as potentially harmful. Detailed instances of erroneous and harmful responses are provided in Supplementary Table 4 for review.

Remarkably, the agent was capable of resolving issues, even in instances where contradictory information was provided in a patient's description, such as discrepancies in reported mutations versus results of testing such mutations using tools. In such cases, the agent pointed out these inconsistencies, recommended further genetic confirmation and outlined potential treatment options based on the results (patients D and X). An illustrative example of the model's response is presented in Fig. 3.

Next, we assessed the degree of helpfulness of the agent by evaluating the proportion of subquestions it answered sophistically according to the human evaluators. Among the aggregate of 67 queries, 63 (94.0%) were categorized as having been effectively addressed.

Fourth, aiming to ensure transparency in the decision-making process, we instigated its adherence to citing relevant sources. Through manual review, we determined that, of the 257 citations provided in the models' responses, 194 (75.5%) were accurately aligned with the model's assertions, while 59 (23.0%) were found to be unrelated and merely 4 (1.6%) were found to be in conflict with the model's statement. These findings are promising, highlighting that instances of erroneous extrapolation (so-termed hallucinations) by the model are limited. Supplementary Notes 2 and 3 respectively display the unprocessed complete results from using the tools and the entire model outputs. Detailed evaluation results from each human observer are elaborated on in Supplementary Tables 4–6. Evaluation results for GPT-4 without tools and retrieval that we benchmarked for completeness can be found in Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Note 3.

Overall, our results show that GPT-4 with tools and RAG can deliver highly accurate, helpful and well-cited responses, which enhances its ability to handle complex medical scenarios and provide support for clinical decision-making.

Our results demonstrate that combining precision medicine tools with an LLM enhances its capabilities in problem solving, aligning with the concept of using LLMs as ‘reasoning engines' (ref. 30). As we have shown, GPT-4 alone only generates very generic or wrong responses. However, integrating three core elements (a reasoning engine, a knowledge database and tools) enables us to effectively address this limitation, greatly improving accuracy and reliability. Additionally, using tools has several further advantages. Despite the potential future development of a generalist medical multimodal foundation model10, its efficacy in addressing very specialized medical queries, such as predicting rare mutations or measuring disease development on the millimeter scale compared to narrower, domain-specific models, remains uncertain. Moreover, maintaining the alignment of such a generalist model with the evolving medical knowledge and updates in treatment guidelines is challenging, as it requires retraining model components on new data. Our tool-based approach, however, addresses all of these issues. It allows for the rapid update of medical knowledge by simply replacing documents in the database or searches through Google or PubMed, eliminating the need for direct modifications to the core model itself. Similarly, state-of-the-art medical devices that are approved by regulatory authorities can be included in our setup. Additionally, by using RAG, our system effectively addresses a major limitation in current LLMs, which often tend to hallucinate by providing wrong but seemingly correct or plausible answers to questions beyond their knowledge4. Mitigating this issue is particularly critical in sensitive domains such as healthcare. We show that our approach demonstrates a high capability in delivering accurate answers, supported by relevant citations from authoritative sources, which also facilitates quick fact-checking as the agent returns the exact original text from the guideline documents.

Our work has several limitations. The most notable is the small sample size for evaluation. Constructing these cases from real-world data requires careful manual crafting and evaluation while adhering to data protection standards, especially for cloud-based processing. We, therefore, consider our work as a proof-of-concept study for agentic AI workflows in oncology and encourage future efforts to develop larger-scale benchmark cases.

An important aspect beyond the scope of our study, which should be addressed in future research, is the selection of medical tools. While the core focus of our work lies in the tool-using abilities of language model agents, it is essential to recognize that individual tools require better independent optimization and validation. For example, we do not possess annotated ground-truth segmentation masks for comparison to MedSAM but use clinical endpoints such as progressive disease or tumor shrinkage as our primary metric to measure outcomes, which even more closely reflects the clinical workflow. As another example, vision transformers in our study were trained and tested on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and some radiology images available online may have been included in the pretraining of GPT-4V. In a production environment, however, such tools would simply be replaced with better-validated and extensively tested alternatives, such as the clinical-grade MSIntuit model31. Overall, we believe that, by prioritizing clinical endpoints to validate our agent pipeline, we can offer new, directly relevant evidence and metrics to address the current scarcity of objective measures for AI agents in healthcare.

Regarding the agent, although equipped with a broad array of tools compared to other frameworks17, it remains in an experimental stage, thus limiting clinical applicability. One notable restriction for instance lies in the provision of only a singular slice of radiology images and the yet limited capabilities of GPT-4V (ref. 32) in interpreting medical images. We anticipate great progress in generalist foundation models with greatly enhanced capabilities in interpreting three-dimensional (3D) images, including medical images. In this regard, we expect the development of more advanced, specialized medical image–text models, similar to the recently introduced Merlin model for 3D CT imaging33, which would allow adding these models as additional tools instead of simple ones such as MedSAM into our pipeline. Furthermore, an image–text model for radiology could also incorporate information on patient history and previous therapies to evaluate the current state of the disease like a radiologist would, instead of relying on lesion size changes only.

Moreover, our current agent architecture is a static design choice. Medical professionals, however, have access to an extensive array of complex tools and can alternate between tool usage and knowledge retrieval. For AI agents, integrating RAG and tool use concurrently could also be complementary, as RAG could assist in guiding the agent through complicated steps of tool application for specific diagnostic or treatment decisions. This synergy might help improve complex workflows with more and more challenging tools, which remains an area of further exploration.

Additionally, despite being implemented as a multiturn chat agent, our evaluation is currently confined to a single interaction. As a next step, we aim to incorporate multiturn conversations, including human feedback for refinement, akin to a ‘human-in-the-loop' concept34.

Furthermore, we restricted our patient scenarios to oncological use cases only, yet it is important to note that the underlying framework could be adapted to virtually any medical specialty, given the appropriate tools and data.

Next, regarding data protection in real-world settings, current regulatory restrictions make GPT-4 unsuitable because of its cloud-based nature, which necessitates transferring sensitive patient data to proprietary commercial servers. Consequently, we regard GPT-4 as a best-in-class model for proof-of-concept purposes and aim to explore open-weight models that can be deployed on local servers in the near future. Newer and better models, especially Llama-3 405B (ref. 35), might be promising candidates.

Moreover, medically fine-tuned models or models broadly optimized for tool use, such as Hermes-3-Llama-3.1 (ref. 36), also show considerable potential as local solutions.

Additionally, while our model receives relevant context from the RAG pipeline to provide accurate citations, there are several modifications and potential improvements to the retrieval process that we suggest exploring in future work. For instance, we used generalist embedding, retrieval and reranking models, whereas Xiong et al.37 demonstrated that domain-specific models can enhance retrieval performance. Moreover, for rare terms (such as rare diseases), exact match keyword searches can outperform similarity searches in embedding space and both can even be combined (also termed hybrid search38).

Moreover, modeling long context dependencies could be further improved by using models with larger context windows, such as Gemini 1.5 (ref. 39). This capability is especially crucial when scaling our approach to settings where patient information is not restricted to a single one-page case vignette but distributed across hundreds of documents.

Lastly, from a production setting perspective, another critical aspect is to consider how the LLM handles temporal dependencies in treatment recommendations. For instance, in lung cancer, molecular targeted treatments are subject to rapid changes and official guidelines are not always updated at the same pace as the latest trial results. In such a setting, our multitool agent could cross-reference information from official medical guidelines with more up-to-date information received through internet and PubMed searches. Previous work already showed that LLMs can reliably identify temporal differences in medical documents4.

Looking ahead, we anticipate more progress in the development of AI agents with even improved capabilities through further scaling. As a parallel step in this direction, Zhou et al.40 developed MedVersa, an AI system for medical image interpretation that leverages an LLM as a central ‘orchestrator'. This model is fully trainable to determine whether tasks can be completed independently or should be delegated to a specialist vision model and has demonstrated superior performance across multiple medical imaging benchmarks, often surpassing state-of-the-art models. The training of such a system holds immense potential, as it might allow models to learn critical concepts such as uncertainty, enabling them to recognize their limitations and delegate tasks to specialist models whenever appropriate. Although our model currently shows a strong ability to use given tools, task-specific fine-tuning and few-shot prompting41 (providing examples to the model) could further improve performance, particularly when increasing complexity with the addition of more and more complex tools. Additionally, we could enhance the system by incorporating human feedback on edge cases where the initial model performed poorly, similar to a human-in-the-loop approach. In the medical context, this method was already shown to improve prediction accuracy, as demonstrated in the context of molecular tumor board recommendations42.

To summarize, in the near future, we envision a framework that embodies characteristics akin to the GMAI model with the added ability to access precision medicine tools tailored to answer any kind of specialized clinical questions. This approach has multiple benefits. It enables medical AI models to assist clinicians in solving real-world patient scenarios using precision medicine tools, each tailored to specific tasks. Such a strategy facilitates circumventing data availability constraints inherent in the medical domain, where data are not uniformly accessible across all disciplines, preventing a singular entity from developing an all-encompassing foundational model. Instead, entities can leverage smaller, specialized models developed by those with direct access to the respective data, which could greatly improve discovering therapeutic options for personalized treatments. Moreover, this modular approach allows for individual validation, updating and regulatory compliance of each tool. In cases where existing tools are unsatisfactory or completely absent, the agent could rely on its internal strong medical domain knowledge and either refine43 or innovate entirely new tools from scratch. Crucially, this modular approach also offers far superior explainability compared to a large, generalist black-box model, as physicians can investigate the output from each individual tool separately. Herein, our study could serve as a blueprint, providing evidence that agent-based generalist medical AI is within reach.

To fully leverage the potential of AI agents in the near future, it will be crucial to integrate them as deeply into routine clinical practice as possible, ideally through direct incorporation into existing clinical information systems for live access to patient data with only minimal workflow disruption for clinicians. However, this first necessitates addressing many deployment challenges, including concerns regarding interoperability with existing systems, data privacy laws such as GDPR and HIPAA (in case of cloud-based models), liability and accountability issues and the need for regulatory approvals as medical devices44, which will also require much broader validation studies to show safety and benefits in actual clinical workflows. Lastly, there will be a critical need to educate medical professionals to effectively collaborate with AI agents while maintaining full authority over the final clinical decision-making.

This study did not include confidential patient information. All research procedures were conducted exclusively on publicly accessible, anonymized patient data and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, maintaining all relevant ethical standards. The overall analysis was approved by the Ethics Commission of the Medical Faculty of the Technical University Dresden (BO-EK-444102022).

The pipeline's primary goal is to compile a comprehensive dataset from high-quality medical sources, ensuring three main components: correctness, up-to-dateness and contextual relevance, with a particular emphasis on including knowledge across all medical domains while additionally encompassing information specifically tailored to oncology. We restricted our data access to six sources: MDCalc (https://www.mdcalc.com/) for clinical scores, UpToDate and MEDITRON14 for general-purpose medical recommendations and the Clinical Practice Guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology45, the European Society of Medical Oncology and the German and English subset of the Onkopedia guidelines from the German Society for Hematology and Medical Oncology. We retrieved and downloaded the relevant documents as either HTML extracted text or raw PDF files. To reduce the number of documents for the embedding step, we applied a keyword-based filtering of the document contents, targeting terms relevant to our specific use case. Medical guidelines that were obtained from the MEDITRON project were directly accessible as preprocessed jsonlines files.

The critical challenge in text extraction from PDF documents arises from the inherent nature of PDF files, which are organized primarily for the user's ease of reading and display while not adhering to a consistent hierarchical structure, thus complicating the extraction process. For instance, upon text mining with conventional tools such as PyPDF2 or PyMuPDF, headers, subheaders and key information from the main text may be irregularly placed, with titles occasionally embedded within paragraphs and critical data abruptly interspersed within unrelated text. However, maintaining the integrity of the original document's structure is crucial in the medical field to ensure that extracted information remains contextually coherent, preventing any conflation or misinterpretation. To overcome these limitations, we used GROBID (generation of bibliographic data), a Java application and machine learning library specifically developed for the conversion of unstructured PDF data into a standardized TEI46 format. Through its particular training on scientific and technical articles, GROBID enables the effective parsing of medical documents, preserving text hierarchy and generating essential metadata such as document and journal titles, authorship, pagination, publication dates and download URLs.

We next programmatically retrieved the raw document text from the generated XML fields in the TEI files, concurrently implementing data cleansing. This process encompasses the removal of extraneous and irrelevant information such as hyperlinks, graphical elements and tabular data that was corrupted during the extraction with GROBID, as well as any malformed characters or data such as inadvertently extracted IP addresses. The diversity of source materials presented a further challenge because of their varied formatting schemes. To address this, we meticulously reformatted and standardized the text from all sources, denoting headers with a preceding hash symbol (#) and inserting blank lines for the separation of paragraphs. The purified text, along with its corresponding metadata, was archived in jsonlines format for subsequent processing.

Below, we delineate the detailed architecture of our agent in a two-step process, beginning with the creation of our RAG15 database, followed by an overview of the agent's tool use and concluding with an examination of the final retrieval and response generation modules. Additionally, we highlight the structure of our model in detail in Supplementary Note 4.

We leveraged RAG to synergize the generative capabilities of LLMs with document retrieval to provide domain-specific medical knowledge (context) to a model. The RAG framework has greatly evolved in complexity recently; thus, we break down its architecture into three major components (embeddings, indexing and retrieval) and outline the implementation details of the first two in the next section. In RAG, we begin with the conversion of raw text data into numerical (vector) representations, also termed embeddings, which are consequently stored in a vector database alongside metadata and the corresponding original text (indexing). In more detail, we compute vector embeddings using OpenAI's ‘text-embedding-3-large' model from text segments of varying lengths (512, 256 and 128 tokens), each featuring a 50-token overlap, from the curated guideline cleaned main texts in our dataset, alongside their associated metadata for potential filtering operations. For storage, we use an instance of a local vector database (Chroma) that also facilitates highly efficient lookup operations using vector-based similarity measures such as cosine similarity (dense retrieval). We store documents from different sources in the same collection.

To endow the LLM with agentic capabilities, we equipped it with an array of tools, including the ability to conduct web searches through the Google custom search API and formulate custom PubMed queries. Information retrieved through Google search underwent text extraction and purification and was integrated directly as context within the model, while responses from PubMed were processed akin to the above-described RAG procedure in a separate database.

For the interpretation of visual data, such as CT or MRI scans, the LLM agent has access to two different tools. It can either call the GPT-4 Vision (GPT-4V) model, which is instructed to generate a comprehensive, detailed and structured report, or use MedSAM, which we explain in detail below. For both tasks, we primarily use representative slices from in-house CT and MRI chest and abdomen series, although a few cases are from public datasets, as highlighted in Supplementary Note 1. Our in-house slices were selected by an experienced radiologist from our team, who was blinded to the rest of the study at the time of image selection. In scenarios involving multiple images to model disease development over time, the model first investigates and reports on each image separately before synthesizing a comparative analysis. Because of the stringent adherence of OpenAI to ethical guidelines, particularly concerning the management of medical image data, we framed our patient cases as hypothetical scenarios when presenting them to the model. However, instances of refusal still arose, prompting us to discard the respective run entirely and initiate a new one from the beginning. Additionally, tasks that require the ability of the model to precisely measure the size of lesions and compare them over time can be solved using MedSAM22. MedSAM produces a segmentation mask for a given region of interest on the basis of an image and pixel-wise bounding box coordinates, enabling the calculation of the overall surface area. Herein, MedSAM processes each image independently; however, GPT-4 can track the results from MedSAM back to the original image date, as it has access to image file names that are based on date. This capability ensures accurate decision-making of lesion development over time. An example of this is demonstrated in Supplementary Note 2 under tool results for patient G. A potential limitation of the vision tool approach is that, for both scenarios, we currently restrict the use to single-slice images that additionally need to be taken at the same magnification.

Moreover, we provide access to a simplified calculation tool that allows elementary arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division by executing code locally using the Python interpreter.

To facilitate addressing queries related to precision oncology, the LLM leverages the OncoKB25 database to access critical information on medical evidence for treating a vast panel of genetic anomalies, including mutations, copy-number alterations and structural rearrangements. More specifically, GPT-4 can send the HUGO symbol, the change of interest (mutation, amplification or variant) and a specific alteration of interest (such as BRAFV600E) if applicable to the OncoKB API that returns a structured JSON object containing potential Food and Drug Administration-approved or investigational drug options including evidence levels. This enables querying any type of genetic arrangement, given it is listed on OncoKB and an appropriate license is acknowledged by the user.

Lastly, GPT-4 is also equipped to engage specialized vision transformer models for the histopathological analysis of phenotypic alterations underlying MSI24 or KRAS and BRAF mutations. For the KRAS and BRAF mutation prediction models, we used a setup similar to Wagner et al.23. These models were obtained by training a vision classifier model using histopathology features extracted from images of colorectal cancer tissue from TCGA. For feature extraction, we used CTranspath47, a state-of-the-art transformer model trained through self-supervised learning. To optimize time and computational resources, features were pre-extracted with CTranspath, which is a common procedure in computational pathology pipelines48. Consequently, instead of the original images, GPT-4 transmits these pre-extracted features to the MSI, KRAS, and BRAF vision transformers; however, it is important to note that this implementation detail is hidden from GPT-4 and, thus, has no influence on our overall pipeline. It, however, allows us to reduce the time and hardware requirements for each run in a research setting. For deployment purposes, one could easily, without making changes to the LLM agent itself, hide additional logic to extract features on the fly from the original images.

During each invocation, GPT-4 has to determine the availability of histopathology images for a patient, locate them within the system and select the targets (one, two or all three) for testing. It then receives a binary prediction (MSI versus MSS, KRAS mutant versus wild type or BRAF mutant versus wild type) along with the mutation probability in percentage.

All necessary information for calling the designated tools is derivable or producible from the given patient context. Unlike the retrieval phase, which we manually enforced at each invocation, the decision regarding the use and timing of tools is dependent only on the agent's reasoning. However, manual intervention to prompt tool usage is possible, as demonstrated in patients D and X. The specifications for all tools are delineated in JSON format, which is provided to the model and encompasses a brief textual description of each tool's function along with the required input parameters. From a procedural point of view, given an input comprising a variable-length textual patient context and a text query, the agent generates an initial action plan, followed by a series of iterative tool applications. The deployment of these tools can be executed either independently in parallel or sequentially, wherein the output from one tool serves as the input for another in subsequent rounds; for instance, the size of the segmentation areas obtained from two images through MedSAM can be used to compute a ratio and, thus, define disease progression, stability or response, as shown schematically in Fig. 1 and the patient case from Fig. 3.

The final retrieval and response generation pipeline is implemented using DSPy49, a library that allows for a modular composition of LLM calls. All instructions to the model can be found in our official GitHub repository. Firstly, the model receives the original patient context, the posed question and the outcomes from the tool applications as input. In a method similar to that described by Xiong et al.50, we used chain-of-thought reasoning51 to let the model decompose the initial user query into up to 12 more granular subqueries derived from both the initial patient context and the outcomes from tool applications. This facilitates the retrieval of documents from the vector database that more closely align with each aspect of a multifaceted user query. Precisely, for each generated subquery we extract the top k most analogous document passages from the collection. Subsequently, these data are combined, deduplicated, reranked and finally forwarded to the LLM. We highlight this process in more detail as pseudocode in Supplementary Note 4. Each request sent by the LLM to the RAG pipeline is transformed into a numerical representation using the same embedding model applied to the medical guidelines. We next use cosine distance (lower is better) to compare the query with any embedded chunk from the medical guidelines in the vector database, sorting in ascending order to retrieve the top 40 vectors, each mapped to their respective original text passage. Then, we use Cohere's reranking model (Cohere Rerank 3 English) to reorder the retrieved text passages on the basis of their semantic similarity to the LLM's query. This step filters out passages that exhibit falsely high similarity (low distance) in embedding space but are contextually irrelevant. For example, a query such as ‘Which drug is approved for NSCLC?' and text from a guideline saying ‘Drug A is not approved for non-small cell lung cancer' may show high cosine similarity (low distance), yet the former is irrelevant to the query. The reranking step helps to rank such passages lower. From the reranked results, we keep only the top ten relevant passages and repeat this entire process for each subquery (subtopic) generated by the model on the basis of the provided patient information. To reduce token usage, we remove duplicates from the entire collection of guideline text chunks, prefixed each with an enumeration of ‘Source [x]: …' to allow for accurate citations and then sent the data back to the LLM.

Before generating the final answer, we instruct the LLM to generate a step-by-step strategy to build a structured response including identifying missing information that could help refine and personalize the recommendations. The resulting model output is then synthesized on the basis of all available information, strictly following the strategy as a hierarchical blueprint. To enhance the system's reliability and enable thorough fact-checking, both of which are fundamental in real-world medical applications, the model was programmatically configured to incorporate citations for each statement (as defined as a maximum of two consecutive sentences) using DSPy suggestions49. On the implementation level, the LLM performs a self-evaluation step, wherein it compares its own output to the respective context from our database in a window of one to two sentences. We perform a single iteration over this procedure. All prompts are implemented using DSPy's signatures.

We additionally performed comparisons of GPT-4 with two state-of-the-art open-weight LLMs, namely Llama-3 70B from Meta AI28 and Mixtral 8x7B from Mistral29. On the basis of initial evidence from testing, we slightly simplified and shortened the original prompt from GPT-4 but left all other parameters with respect to the original tool composition unaltered. We evaluated the performance of function calling against GPT-4 on the 20 patient cases, reporting the following metrics: the fraction of required tool calls that were completed successfully (required/successful) and those that were required but failed (required/failed). Additionally, we assessed the fraction of necessary tool calls that the model failed to invoke (required/unused). Lastly, we measured the ratio of superfluous tool calls that the models invoked and that failed (not required/failed).

In our study, we consistently used the following models through the official OpenAI Python API for all experiments. The core framework for the agent and all tools involving an LLM is the gpt-4-0125-preview model (GPT-4). For tasks requiring visual processing, the gpt-4-vision-preview (GPT-4V) model was used through the chat completions endpoint. The temperature value for both models was empirically set to 0.2 for the agent phase and 0.1 during RAG upon initial experimentation and no further modifications of model hyperparameters were performed. Additionally, for generating text embeddings, we used the latest version of OpenAI's embedding models, specifically the text-embedding-3-large model, which produces embeddings with a dimensionality of 3,072. To establish a baseline for comparison without tools and retrieval, we also evaluated GPT-4 with identical hyperparameters using a chain-of-thought reasoning module. Additionally, for model benchmarking, we used the Meta Llama-3 70B model (llama3-70b-8192) and Mistral's Mixtral 8x7B model (mixtral-8x7b-32768) through the Groq API, setting temperature values to 0.2 and the maximum number of output tokens to 4096.

To address the limitations in current biomedical benchmarks, we compiled a collection of 20 distinct multimodal patient cases, primarily focusing on gastrointestinal oncology, including colorectal, pancreatic, cholangiocellular and hepatocellular cancers. Each case provided a comprehensive but entirely fictional patient profile, which includes a concise medical history overview encompassing diagnoses, notable medical events and previous treatments. We paired each patient with either a single or two slices of CT or MRI imaging that served as either sequential follow-up staging scans of the liver or lungs or simultaneous staging scans of both the liver and the lungs at a single point in time. Images were obtained predominantly from internal sources from the Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University Hospital Aachen, but we included a few samples from the web and the Cancer Imaging Archive52,53. We highlight these cases in Supplementary Note 1. Histology images were obtained from TCGA. We additionally included information into genomic variations (mutations and gene fusions) in several patient descriptions. To evaluate our model's proficiency in handling complex information, we decided to not pose a single straightforward question but instead structured each query with multiple subtasks, subquestions and instructions, necessitating the model to handle an average of three to four subtasks in each round. To evaluate the robustness of the model in using tools across various patient factors (Extended Data Fig. 1), we generated 15 random combinations of age, sex and origin for each of the 20 base cases, resulting in a total of 300 combinations.

To enhance the assessment of free-text output, we developed a structured evaluation framework, drawing inspiration from the methodology of Singhal et al.54. Our evaluation focused on three primary aspects: the use of tools by the agent, the quality of the text output produced by the model and the adherence in providing accurate citations.

In reference to the former, we established a manual baseline for the expected use of tools necessary for generating additional patient information that is crucial for resolving the patient's task. We measured this by the ratio of actual versus expected (required) tool uses. The requirement of tool use was defined as either the model is directly instructed to use a certain tool or the output of a tool is essential to proceed in answering the question, which is the default setting in almost all situations. Additionally, we assessed the helpfulness of the model, quantified by the proportion of user instructions and subquestions directly addressed and resolved by the model.

In assessing the textual outputs, our evaluation first encompassed factual correctness, defined by the proportion of correct replies relative to all model outputs. To segment answers into more manageable units, we split each reply according to statement (where a statement is considered a segment that concludes with either a reference to literature or is followed by a shift in topic in the subsequent sentence). Correspondingly, we distinguished between incorrectness and harmfulness in responses. Incorrect responses may include suggestions for superfluous diagnostic procedures or contain requests for irrelevant patient information. Conversely, harmful responses, while also incorrect, were determined by clinical judgment as potentially deleterious, such as advising suboptimal or contraindicated treatments. Furthermore, we assessed the completeness of the responses. For this purpose, we identified multiple specific keywords and terms for each unique medical scenario. These keywords represent expected interventions, such as treatments or diagnostic procedures and were carefully selected for their case relevance and crafted to be as specific as possible (for example, precise treatment combinations such as ‘FOLFOX and bevacizumab' instead of ‘chemotherapy and antiangiogenic drugs'). This criterion, which we term ‘completeness', was supposed to measure the extent to which the agent's response aligns with the essential information that oncologists would anticipate in a human-generated answer under similar conditions.

Lastly, we evaluated the alignment of the responses with the original document segments used by the model through RAG. For each reference in the model's output, we investigated the corresponding reference by its source identifier. Our evaluation encompassed three critical dimensions: citation correctness, ensuring the model's statements faithfully mirror the content of the original document, irrelevance, identifying instances where the model's assertions are not substantiated by the source material, and incorrect citation, detecting discrepancies where the information attributed to a source diverges from its actual content.

All evaluations described here were performed independently by four certified clinicians with expertise in oncology. For all benchmarks, we reported the majority vote. In cases of a tie, we selected the most adverse outcome, adhering to a hierarchical schema: correct, irrelevant and wrong for citations and correct, wrong and harmful for the correctness evaluation.

Data were analyzed using the pandas library and visualized with matplotlib in Python.

Data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested. Sample sizes were set at n = 20. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes. Experiments were not randomized, as only one test group (the AI agent) existed in this proof-of-concept study. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment; however, they were blinded to the model responses while establishing the ground truth for the necessity of tool use and the completeness of the responses. Experiments were limited to n = 1 per case because of stringent rate and access limitations at the time of experimentation, when access to GPT-4V was available only as a preview. No data were excluded in the analysis. Reproducibility of the study's findings may be affected by silent changes implemented to the model by its developers, which may not always be publicly disclosed, as well as by potential future model deprecations. Despite these factors, the results are expected to remain reproducible when using other current state-of-the-art models. Additionally, built-in guardrails designed to prevent potentially harmful content occasionally led to refusals and to inadequately addressing medical queries. In these instances, we reran each sample in newly instantiated settings until no such refusals occurred.

We show more details on the simulated patient cases from our benchmarking experiments including the sex (A) and age (B) distribution for all 20 cases. The pie chart in C shows the proportions of patient origins by country and ethnicity. For 55% of the patients, we did not provide this information in the patient case vignette (n/a), while the remaining 45% included diverse information on patient origin. (D) To investigate whether gender, age, and origin influence the models' tool-calling behavior, we conducted an additional experiment with 15 random permutations on all 20 patient cases (300 in total). Notably, we observed that in contrary to patient cases requiring relatively fewer tools (for example, patients Adams, Lopez and Williams), there was higher variability in tool-calling behavior in situations requiring more tools (for example, patient Ms Xing), regardless of the combinations of age, sex, and ethnicity/origin. Heatmaps are annotated on the x-axis as ‘age-sex-ethnicity/country of origin'.

Climate breakdown and unprecedented biodiversity loss put humanity at grave risk, and threaten human lives, livelihoods and well-being globally. Ecologists have been instrumental in revealing and detailing some of the mechanisms that drive biodiversity decline, and regularly call for immediate action1. In response to this, a sense of emergency has entered public discourse, and is heightened with each new report and global summit; some ecological societies have been calling on their members to write to their political representatives, and many ecologists have been vocal about both scientific and societal issues on social media. Yet, despite these pockets of activity, it has been argued that the way that the discipline of ecology operates could reflect more clearly the urgency of the situation2,3.

Several factors might contribute to the current mismatch. First, as with any other scientists, ecologists have been encouraged to place themselves in a neutral, reporting, objective role4. Those who deviate from this tack have encountered increasing threats to their academic freedom and activities, especially with the rise of political populism and nationalism around the world5. Second, the emergence of conservation biology in the 1980s provided a clear home for mission-driven ecologists who aspire to go beyond applied science6. Third, the scientific community is embedded in societies and economic systems that are primarily hardwired to economic growth, in which (1) facts alone do little to address systemic issues that underlie biodiversity loss and climate change, and (2) high-level decisions about research funding are increasingly shaped by their perceived contribution to economic growth2,7.

Metrics details

From visual perception to language, sensory stimuli change their meaning depending on previous experience. Recurrent neural dynamics can interpret stimuli based on externally cued context, but it is unknown whether they can compute and employ internal hypotheses to resolve ambiguities. Here we show that mouse retrosplenial cortex (RSC) can form several hypotheses over time and perform spatial reasoning through recurrent dynamics. In our task, mice navigated using ambiguous landmarks that are identified through their mutual spatial relationship, requiring sequential refinement of hypotheses. Neurons in RSC and in artificial neural networks encoded mixtures of hypotheses, location and sensory information, and were constrained by robust low-dimensional dynamics. RSC encoded hypotheses as locations in activity space with divergent trajectories for identical sensory inputs, enabling their correct interpretation. Our results indicate that interactions between internal hypotheses and external sensory data in recurrent circuits can provide a substrate for complex sequential cognitive reasoning.

External context can change the processing of stimuli through recurrent neural dynamics1. In this process, the evolution of neural population activity depends on its own history as well as external inputs2, giving context-specific meaning to otherwise ambiguous stimuli3. To study how hypotheses can be held in memory and serve as internal signals to compute new information, we developed a task that requires sequential integration of spatially separated ambiguous landmarks4. In this task, the information needed to disambiguate the stimuli is not provided externally but must be computed, maintained over time and applied to the stimuli by the brain.

We trained freely moving mice to distinguish between two perceptually identical landmarks, formed by identical dots on a computer-display arena floor, by sequentially visiting them and reasoning about their relative locations. The landmarks were separated by <180 degrees in an otherwise featureless circular arena (50-cm diameter), to create a clockwise (CW) (‘a') and a counterclockwise (CCW) (‘b') landmark. Across trials, the relative angle between landmarks was fixed and the same relative port was always the rewarded one; within trials, the locations of landmarks was fixed. The mouse's task was to find and nose-poke at the CCW ‘b' landmark for water reward (‘b' was near one of 16 identical reward ports spaced uniformly around the arena; other ports caused a time out). At most, one landmark was visible at a time (enforced by tracking mouse position and modulating landmark visibility based on relative distance (Extended Data Fig. 1; Methods). Each trial began with the mouse in the center of the arena in the dark (‘LM0' phase; Fig. 1b), without knowledge of its initial pose. In the interval after first encountering a landmark (‘LM1' phase), an ideal agent's location uncertainty is reduced to two possibilities, but there is no way to disambiguate whether it saw ‘a' or ‘b.' After seeing the second landmark, an ideal agent could infer landmark identity (‘a' or ‘b'; this is the ‘LM2' phase; Fig. 1b) by estimating the distance and direction traveled since the first landmark and comparing those with the learned relative layout of the two landmarks; thus, an ideal agent can use sequential spatial reasoning to localize itself unambiguously. For most analyses, we ignored cases where mice might have gained information from not encountering a landmark, for example, as the artificial neural network (ANN) does in Fig. 2e (and Extended Data Fig. 2e). To randomize the absolute angle of the arena at the start of each new trial (and thus avoid use of any olfactory or other allocentric cues), mice had to complete a separate instructed visually guided dot-hunting task, after which the landmarks and rewarded port were rotated randomly together (Extended Data Fig. 1b).

a, Two perceptually identical landmarks are visible only from close up, and their identity is defined only by their relative location. One of 16 ports, at landmark ‘b,' delivers reward in response to a nose-poke. The animal must infer which of the two landmarks is ‘b' to receive reward; wrong pokes result in timeout. Tetrode array recordings in RSC yield 50–90 simultaneous neurons. b, Top, schematic example trial; bottom, best possible guesses of the mouse position. LM0, LM1 and LM2 denote task phases when the mouse has seen zero, one or two landmarks and could infer their position with decreasing uncertainty. c, Left, example training curve showing Phit/Pfalse-positive; random chance level is 1/16 for 16 ports. Mice learned the task at values >1, showing they could disambiguate between the two sequentially visible landmarks. This requires the formation, maintenance and use of spatial hypotheses. Asterisks denote per-session binomial 95% significance for the correct rate. Right, summary statistics show binomial CIs on last half of sessions for all four mice. d, Mouse location heatmap from one session (red) with corresponding spatial firing rate profiles for five example cells; color maps are normalized per cell. e, Task phase (corresponding to hypothesis states in b can be decoded from RSC firing rates.

Gray, sum-normalized histograms (color scale as in d).

a, Schematic examples of hypothesis-dependent landmark interpretation. Left, mouse encounters first LM, then identifies the second as ‘a' based on the short relative distance. Right, a different path during LM1 leads the mouse to a different hypothesis state, and to identify the perceptually identical second landmark as ‘b.' Hypothesis states preceding LM2 are denoted LM1a and LM1b, depending on the identity of the second landmark. b, Structure of an ANN trained on the task. Inputs encode velocity and landmarks. Right, mean absolute localization error averaged across test trials for random trajectories. c, Activity of output neurons ordered by preferred location shows transition between LM0, LM1 and LM2 phases. Red, true location. During LM1 (when the agent has only seen one landmark), two hypotheses are maintained, with convergence to a stable unimodal location estimate in LM2 after encountering the second landmark. d, 3D projection from PCA of ANN hidden neuron activities. During LM2, angular position in neural state space reflects position estimate encoding. e, Example ANN trajectories for two trials show how identical visual input (black arrowheads) leads the activity to travel to different locations on the LM2 attractor because of different preceding LM1a/b states.

Mice learned the task (P < 0.0001 on all mice, Binomial test versus random guessing; Fig. 1c), showing that they learn to form hypotheses about their position during the LM1 phase, retain and update these hypotheses with self-motion information until they encounter the second (perceptually identical) landmark, and use them to disambiguate location and determine the rewarded port. We hypothesized that RSC, which integrates self-motion5, position6,7,8, reward value9 and sensory10 inputs, could perform this computation. RSC is causally required to process landmark information11, and we verified that RSC is required for integrating spatial hypotheses with visual information but not for direct visual search with no memory component (Extended Data Fig. 1i–l).

We recorded 50–90 simultaneous neurons in layer 5 of RSC in four mice during navigational task performance using tetrode array drives12 and behavioral tracking (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Figs. 1 and 3; Methods). RSC neurons encoded information about both the mouse's location (Fig. 1d) and about the task phase, corresponding to possible location hypotheses (Fig. 1d,e). This hypothesis encoding was not restricted to a separate population: most cells encoded both hypothesis state as well as the animal's location (Fig. 1g).

This encoding was distinct from the encoding of landmark encounters in the interleaved dot-hunting task and was correlated per session with behavioral performance (Extended Data Fig. 4). The encoding of mouse location changed significantly across task phases (Fig. 1d,f), similar to the conjunctive coding for other spatial and task variables in RSC6. This mixed co-encoding of hypothesis, location and other variables suggests that RSC can transform new ambiguous sensory information into unambiguous spatial information through the maintenance and task-specific use of internally generated spatial hypotheses.

To test whether recurrent neural networks can solve sequential spatial reasoning tasks that require hypothesis formation, and to provide insight into how this might be achieved in the brain, we trained a recurrent ANN on a simplified one-dimensional (1D) version of the task, since the relevant position variable for the landmarks was their angular position (inputs were random noisy velocity trajectories and landmark positions, but not their identity; Fig. 2b). The ANN performed as well as a near Bayes-optimal particle filter (Fig. 2b), outperforming path integration with correction (corresponding to continuous path integration13,14 with boundary/landmark resetting15,16) and represented multimodal hypotheses, transitioning from a no-information state (in LM0) to a bimodal two-hypothesis coding state (LM1) and finally to a full information, one-hypothesis coding state (LM2) (Fig. 2c,d and Extended Data Fig. 5). Bimodal hypothesis states did not emerge when the ANN was given the landmark identity (Extended Data Fig. 5h–k). Together, this shows that recurrent neural dynamics are sufficient to internally generate, retain and apply hypotheses to reason across time based on ambiguous sensory and motor information, with no external disambiguating inputs.

Both ANN and RSC neurons encoded several navigation variables conjunctively (Extended Data Fig. 2b) and transitioned from encoding egocentric landmark-relative position during LM1 to a more allocentric encoding during LM2 (Extended Data Fig. 6). Instantaneous position uncertainty (variance derived from particle filter) could be decoded from ANN activity (Extended Data Fig. 5l), analogous to RSC (Fig. 1e). ANN neurons preferentially represented landmark locations (Extended Data Fig. 2c; consistent with overrepresentation of reward sites in hippocampus17,18), but we did not observe this effect in RSC. Average spatial tuning curves of ANN neurons were shallower in the LM1 state relative to LM2, corresponding to trial-by-trial ‘disagreements' between neurons, evident as bimodal rates per location. RSC rates similarly became less variable across trials per location in LM2 (Extended Data Fig. 7), indicating that, in addition to the explicit encoding of hypotheses/uncertainty (Fig. 1e,g), there is a higher degree of trial-to-trial variability in RSC as a function of spatial uncertainty.

The ANN computed, retained and used multimodal hypotheses to interpret otherwise ambiguous inputs: after encountering the first landmark, the travel direction and distance to the second is sufficient to identify it as ‘a' or ‘b' (Figs. 1b and 2a). There are four possible scenarios for the sequence of landmark encounters: ‘a' then ‘b', or ‘b' then ‘a', for CW or CCW travel directions, respectively. To understand the mechanism by which hypothesis encoding enabled disambiguation, we examined the moment when the second landmark becomes visible and can be identified (Fig. 2a). We designate LM1 states in which the following second landmark is ‘a' as ‘LM1a' and those that lead to ‘b' as ‘LM1b.' Despite trial-to-trial variance resulting from random exploration trajectories and initial poses, ANN hidden unit activity fell on a low-dimensional manifold (correlation dimension d ≈ 3; Fig. 3d) and could be well captured in a three-dimensional (3D) embedding using principal component analysis (PCA) (Fig. 2d). Activity states during the LM0,1,2 phases (green, blue and gray/red, respectively) were distinct, and transitions between phases (mediated by identical landmark encounters; black arrows) clustered into discrete locations. Examining representative trajectories (for the CCW case; Fig. 2e) reveals that LM1a and LM1b states are well-separated in activity space. If the second landmark appears at the shorter CCW displacement (corresponding to the ‘a' to ‘b' interval), the state jumps to the ‘b' coding point on the LM2 attractor (Fig. 2e). On the other hand, the absence of a landmark at the shorter displacement causes the activity to traverse LM1a, until the second landmark causes a jump onto the ‘a' coding location on the LM2 attractor. In both cases, an identical transient landmark input pushes the activity from distinct hypothesis-encoding regions of activity space onto different appropriate locations in the LM2 state, constituting successful localization.

a, Correlation structure in ANN activity is maintained across task phases, indicating maintained low-dimensional neural dynamics across different computational regimes. Top, pairwise ANN tuning correlations in LM1 and LM2 (same ordering, by preferred location). Bottom, tuning curve pairs (normalized amplitude). b, Same analysis as a, but for RSC in one session (N = 64 neurons, computed on entire spike trains, sorted via clustering in LM1). The reorganization of spatial coding as hypotheses are updated (Fig. 1d,f) is constrained by the stable pairwise structure of RSC activity. Neurons remain correlated (first and second pair) or anticorrelated (third and fourth pair) across LM1 and LM2. c, Summary statistics (session median and quartiles) for maintenance of correlations across task phases. This also extends to a separate visually guided dot-hunting task (Extended Data Fig. 8). d, Activity in both the ANN and RSC is locally low-dimensional, through correlation dimension (the number of points in a ball of some radius grows with radius to the power of N if data is locally N-dimensional) on 20 principal components. See Extended Data Fig. 8 for analysis by PCA.

We next consider the nature of the dynamics and representation that allows the circuit to encode the same angular position variables across LM1 and LM2 regimes while also encoding the different hypotheses required to disambiguate identical landmarks. Does the latter drive the network to functionally reorganize throughout the computation? Or, does the former, together with the need to maintain and use the internal hypotheses across time, require the network to exhibit stable low-dimensional recurrent attractor dynamics? To test this, we computed the pairwise correlations of the ANN activity states (Fig. 3a) and found them to be well conserved across LM1 and LM2 states. As these correlation matrices are the basis for projections into low-dimensional space, this shows that the same low-dimensional dynamics were maintained, despite spanning different computational and hypothesis-encoding regimes (metastable two-state encoding with path integration in LM1 versus stable single-state path integration unchanged by further landmark inputs in LM2; Extended Data Fig. 5). Low-dimensional pairwise structure was also conserved across different landmark configurations and varied ANN architectures, and the low-dimensionality of ANN states was robust to large perturbations (Extended Data Fig. 5w). In sum, these computations were determined by one stable set of underlying recurrent network dynamics, which, together with appropriate self-motion and landmark inputs, can maintain and update hypotheses to disambiguate identical landmarks over time, with no need for external inputs.

We hypothesized that RSC and its reciprocally connected brain regions may, similarly to the ANN, use internal hypotheses to resolve landmark ambiguities using recurrent dynamics. Using the ANN as a template for a minimal dynamical system that can solve the task (Fig. 2), we asked whether neural activity in RSC is consistent with a system that could solve the task with the same mechanisms. To be described as a dynamical system, neural activity must first be sufficiently constrained by a stable set of dynamics, that is, the activity of neurons must be sufficiently influenced by that of other neurons, and these relationships must be maintained over time1. To test this property, we first computed pairwise rate correlations and found a preserved structure between LM1 and LM2, as in the ANN (median R (across sessions) of Rs (across cells) = 0.74 in RSC, versus 0.73 in ANN; Fig. 3c). Firing rates could be predicted from rates of other neurons, using pairwise rate relationships across task phases; this maintained structure also extended to the visual dot-hunting behavior (Extended Data Fig. 8). Because pairwise correlations form the basis of dimensionality reduction, this shows that low-dimensional RSC activity is coordinated by the constraints of stable recurrent neural dynamics and not a feature of a specific behavioral task or behavior.

To employ neural firing rates as states of a dynamical system that act as memory and computational substrates in the same manner as in the ANN, they should also be low-dimensional. Consistent with the stable relationships between neurons, most RSC population activity was low-dimensional (around six significant principal components, and correlation dimension of around 5.4; Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 8), similar to findings in hippocampus19. Together, we find that despite significant changes in neural encoding as different hypotheses are entertained across task phases (Fig. 1d–f and Extended Data Figs. 3f and 2a) and across different tasks (Extended Data Fig. 4a–d), the evolution of firing rates in RSC is constrained by stable dynamics that could implement qualitatively similar states as the ANN.

To compute with a dynamical system, states that act as memory need to affect how the system reacts to further input. The ANN solves the task using distinct hypothesis states that are updated with visual inputs and locomotion, by placing them in the state space so that visual input arriving at different hypothesis states within LM1 (LM1a versus LM1b) pushes activity onto the correct states in LM2 (Fig. 2). We examined this process in RSC by first looking at the evolution of neural states during the spatial reasoning process. States evolved at speeds correlated with animal locomotion, consistent with the observation that hypotheses are updated by self-motion in between landmark encounters and were driven by landmark encounters consistent with findings in head-fixed tasks11 (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Neural states were also driven by failures to encounter landmarks at expected positions, which can also be informative (Fig. 2e, right), albeit with a different neural encoding than we observed for encountering the landmarks (Extended Data Fig. 2e).

We next tested whether sufficiently separated neural states, LM1a and LM1b, together with stable low-dimensional attractor dynamics could resolve the identity of the second landmark. If so, this would suggest that, as in the ANN, the ensemble activity state in RSC can serve both as memory and affect future computations. We identified subsets of trials in which mouse motion around the LM1 to LM2 transition was matched closely and aligned them in time to the point when the second landmark became visible (Fig. 4a). In these trials, locomotion and visual inputs are matched, and only the preceding hypothesis state (LM1a or b) differs. RSC firing rates differed between LM1a and LM1b states, as did subsequent rates in LM2 (comparing within- to across-group distances in neural state space across matched trials, and by decoding state from firing rates: Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 9i,j).

a, Top, to study hypothesis encoding and its impact without sensory or motor confounds, we used trials with matched egocentric paths just before and after the second landmark (‘a' or ‘b') encounter. One example session is shown. Bottom, 3D neural state space trajectories (isomap); RSC latent states do not correspond directly to those of the ANN. b, RSC encodes the difference between LM1a and LM1b, and between subsequent LM2 states, as in the ANN (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 5). Blue, within-group and grey, across-group distances in neural state space. Horizontal lines, mean; boxes, 95% CIs (bootstrap). State can also be decoded from raw spike rates (Extended Data Fig. 9j). c, Neural dynamics in RSC are smooth across trials: pairwise distances between per trial spike counts in a 750 ms window before LM2 onset remain correlated with later windows; line, median; shading, CIs (bootstrap). d, RSC activity preceding the second landmark encounter predicts correct/incorrect port choice (horizontal line, mean; gray shaded box, 95% CI from bootstrap, cross-validated regression trees). e, Decoding of hypothesis states and position from RSC using ANNs to illustrate the evolution of neural activity in the task-relevant space (see b, c and d and Fig. 1e,f, Extended Data Fig. 9 statistics). f, Schematic of potential computational mechanisms. Left, if RSC encodes only current spatial and sensorimotor states and no hypotheses beyond landmark count (LM1a or LM2b, derived from seeing the first landmark and self-motion integration that lead to identifying the second landmark as ‘a' or ‘b'), an external disambiguating input is needed. Right, because task-specific hypotheses arising from the learned relative position of the landmarks are encoded (this figure), and activity follows stable attractor dynamics (Fig. 3), ambiguous visual inputs can drive the neural activity to different positions, disambiguating landmark identity in RSC analogously to the ANN.

To compute with the same mechanism as the ANN, neural states must be governed by stable dynamics consistently enough for current states to reliably influence future states, which requires that nearby states do not diffuse or mix too quickly1. We found that RSC firing rates were predictable across trials such that neighboring trials in activity space remained neighbors (Fig. 4c), which further confirms stable recurrent dynamics, that these states can be used as computational substrate, and indicates a topological organization of abstract task variables19. This indicates that stably maintained hypothesis-encoding differences in firing over LM1 could interact with ambiguous visual landmark inputs to push neural activity from distinct starting points in neural state space to points that correspond to correct landmark interpretations, as in the ANN.

The ANN achieved high correct rates, but mice make mistakes. If the dynamical systems interpretation holds, such mistakes would be explainable by LM1a or b states that are not in the right location, and lead to the wrong LM2 interpretation. Indeed, we observed that neural trajectories from LM1a that were close in activity space to LM1b were dragged along LM1b trajectories and vice-versa (they had similar movement directions; Extended Data Fig. 9g,h), suggesting that behavioral landmark identification outcomes might be affected by how hypotheses were encoded in RSC during LM1. We tested this hypothesis and found that RSC activity in LM1 (last 5 s preceding the transition to LM2) was predictive of the animal's behavioral choice of the correct versus incorrect port (Fig. 4d). Notably, this behaviorally predictive hypothesis encoding was absent during training in sessions with low task performance (Extended Data Fig. 4), indicating that the dynamical structures and hypothesis states observed in RSC were task-specific and acquired during learning.

Our unrestrained nonstereotyped behavior is not amenable to direct comparison of activity trajectories between ANNs and the brain as others have done in highly stereotyped trials of macaque behavior1. Instead, we found that the dynamics of firing rates in mouse RSC are consistent with, and sufficient for, implementing hypothesis-based disambiguation of identical landmarks using a similar computational mechanism as observed in the ANN.

We report that RSC represents internal spatial hypotheses, sensory inputs and their interpretation and fulfills the requirements for computing and using hypotheses to disambiguate landmark identity using stable recurrent dynamics. Specifically, we found that low-dimensional recurrent dynamics were sufficient to perform spatial reasoning (that is to form, maintain and use hypotheses to disambiguate landmarks over time) in an ANN (Fig. 2 and also see Extended Data Fig. 10 for non-negative ANNs and when no map input was given). We then found that RSC fulfills the requirements for such dynamics, that is, encoding of the required variables (Figs. 1 and 4) with stable low-dimensional (Fig. 3) and smooth dynamics that predicted behavioral outcomes (Fig. 4). Due to the higher trial-to-trial variability and lower number of recorded cells, we do not draw direct connections between specific latent states of the ANN and neural data, as was done in previous studies in primates2,3,20 or simpler mouse tasks19,21.

We observed that local dynamics in RSC can disambiguate sensory inputs based on internally generated and maintained hypotheses without relying on external context inputs at the time of disambiguation (Fig. 4), indicating that RSC can derive hypotheses over time and combine these hypotheses with accumulating evidence from the integration of self-motion (for example, paths after the first landmark encounter) and sensory stimuli to solve a spatiotemporally extended spatial reasoning task. These results do not argue for RSC as an exclusive locus of such computations. There is evidence for parallel computations, likely at different levels of abstraction, across subcortical22 and cortical regions such as PFC3,23,24, PPC25, LIP26 and visual27,28 areas. Further, hippocampal circuits contribute to spatial computations beyond representing space by learning environmental topology29 and constraining spatial coding using attractor dynamics19,30,31 shaped by previous experience32. Finally, the landmark disambiguation that we observed probably interacts with lower sensory areas33, reward value9,34 and action selection computations21,35.

The emergence of conjunctive encoding, explicit hypothesis codes and similar roles for dynamics across RSC and the ANN suggests that spatial computations and, by extension, cognitive processing in neocortex may be constrained by simple cost functions36, similar to sensory37 or motor38 computations. The ANN does not employ sampling-based representations, which have been proposed as possible mechanisms for probabilistic computation39,40, showing that explicit representation of hypotheses and uncertainty as separate regions in rate space could serve as alternative or supplementary mechanism to sampling.

A key open question is how learning a specific environment, task or behavioral context occurs. We observed that hypothesis coding emerges with task learning (Extended Data Fig. 4). Possible, and not mutually exclusive, mechanisms include: (1) changes of the stable recurrent dynamics in RSC, as is suggested in hippocampal CA1 (ref. 29); (2) modification of dynamics by context-specific tonic inputs3,20; or (3) changes in how hypotheses and sensory information are encoded and read out while maintaining attractor dynamics that generalize across environments or tasks, as indicated by the maintenance of recurrent structure across tasks in our data (Extended Data Fig. 8) and as has been shown in entorhinal30 and motor cortex38 and ANNs41,42, possibly helped by the high-dimensional mixed nature of RSC representations43,44. Further, how such processes are driven by factors such as reward expectation34 is an active area of research.

Our findings show that recurrent dynamics in neocortex can simultaneously represent and compute with task and environment-specific multimodal hypotheses in a way that gives appropriate meaning to ambiguous data, possibly serving as a general mechanism for cognitive processes.

Lightweight drive implants with 16 movable tetrodes were built as described previously12. The tetrodes were arranged in an elongated array of approximately 1,250 × 750 µm, with an average distance between electrodes of 250 µm. Tetrodes were constructed from 12.7-µm nichrome wire (Sandvik–Kanthal, QH PAC polyimide coated) with an automated tetrode twisting machine45 and gold-electroplated to an impedance of approximately 300 kΩ.

Mice (male, C57BL/6 RRID: IMSR_JAX:000664) were aged 8–15 weeks at the time of surgery. Animals were housed in pairs or triples when possible and maintained on a 12-h cycle, at 65–70 °F with ~60% humidity. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines and with the approval of the Committee on Animal Care at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). All surgeries were performed under aseptic conditions under stereotaxic guidance. Mice were anesthetized with isofluorane (2% induction, 0.75–1.25% maintenance in 1 l min−1 oxygen) and secured in a stereotaxic apparatus. A heating pad was used to maintain body temperature; additional heating was provided until fully recovered. The scalp was shaved, wiped with hair-removal cream and cleaned with iodine solution and alcohol. After intraperitoneal (IP) injection of dexamethasone (4 mg kg−1), carprofen (5 mg kg−1), subcutaneous injection of slow-release buprenorphine (0.5 mg kg−1) and local application of lidocaine, the skull was exposed. The skull was cleaned with ethanol, and a thin base of adhesive cement (C&B Metabond and Ivoclar Vivadent Tetric EvoFlow) was applied. A stainless steel screw was implanted superficially anterior of bregma to serve as electrical ground.

A 3-mm craniotomy was drilled over central midline cortex, a durotomy was performed on one side of the central sinus and tetrode drives12 were implanted above RSC, at around anterior–posterior (AP) −1.25 to −2.5 mm and medio–lateral (ML) 0.5 mm, with the long axis of the tetrode array oriented AP and the tetrode array tilted inwards at an angle of ~15–20° and fixed with dental cement. The ground connection on the drive was connected to the ground screw, and the skin around the drive implant was brought over the base layer of adhesive as much as possible to minimize the resulting open wound, sutured and secured with surgical adhesive.

At the time of implant surgery, only two of the tetrodes were extended from the drive to serve as guides during the procedure. All other tetrodes were lowered into superficial layers of cortex within 3 days postsurgery. Mice were given 1 week to recover before the start of recordings.

After implant surgery, individual tetrodes were lowered over the course of several days until a depth corresponding to layer 5 was reached and spiking activity was evident. Data were acquired with an Open Ephys46 ONIX47 prototype system at 30 kHz using the Bonsai software48 (v.2.2; https://bonsai-rx.org/). The tether connecting the mouse headstage to the acquisition system was routed through a commutator above the arena and was counterbalanced using a segment of flexible rubber tread. Tetrodes were occasionally lowered by small increments of ~50 µm to restore good recording conditions or to ensure sampling of new cells across sessions.

Voltage data from the 16 tetrodes, sampled at 30 kHz were bandpass filtered at 300–6,000 Hz, and a median of the voltage across all channels that were well connected to tetrode contacts was subtracted from each channel to reduce common-mode noise such as licking artifacts.

Spike sorting was then performed per tetrode using the Mountainsort software49 (https://github.com/flatironinstitute/mountainsort_examples), and neurons were included for further analysis if they had a noise overlap score <0.05, an isolation score >0.75 (provided by Mountainsort49), a clear refractory period (to ensure spikes originated from single neurons), a spike waveform with one peak and a clear asymmetry (to exclude recordings from passing axon segments) and a smooth voltage waveform and ISI (inter spike interval) histogram (to exclude occasional spike candidates driven by electrical noise). Units were not excluded based on firing rates, tuning or any higher order firing properties. The number of simultaneously recorded cells per mouse for the main analyses was as follows. Blackdot, 52,53,54,49; Gothmog, 55,59,52,51,51,85; Nodot, 65,86,72,69; Unnamed1, 67,64; Total, 984. For the entire dataset analyzed in the analysis over learning (Extended Data Fig. 4), a larger number of cells, and of simultaneously recorded cells, were collected, and sessions with <50 cells were included.

To verify the localization of the recording sites (Extended Data Fig. 3), electrolytic lesions were created by passing currents of 20 µA through a subset of tetrodes (roughly four tetrodes per animal) for 30 s each under isoflurane anesthesia, and animals were perfused and brain processed 1 h later. Brains were mounted with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and imaged.

Behavior was carried out in a circular arena of 50-cm diameter. The floor of the arena was formed by a clear acrylic sheet, under which a diffusion screen and a flat-screen TV was positioned on which visual stimuli were displayed. The circular arena wall was formed by 32 flat black acrylic segments, every other one of which contained an opening for a recessed reward ports, 16 in total. Each reward port contained an optical beam break (880-nm infrared (IR), invisible to mouse) that detected if a mouse was holding its nose in the port, a computer-controlled syringe pump for water reward delivery and a dedicated beeper as a secondary reward indicator. The behavior arena was housed in a soundproof and light-insulated box with no indicators that could allow the mice to establish their heading. Video was acquired by a central overhead camera at 30 Hz using a low level of infrared light at 850 nm and the mouse position was tracked using the oat software50 (https://github.com/jonnew/Oat). A custom behavioral control state machine written in Python was triggered every time a new camera frame was acquired, and the position of the animal, time passed and port visits were used to transition the logic of the state machine (Extended Data Fig. 1). For analysis purposes, all behavioral data was resampled to 100 Hz and synchronized to the electrophysiological data.

For pharmacological inactivation of RSC (Extended Data Fig. 1i–l), four mice were trained on a simplified parametric task that permitted us to causally test the role of RSC in individual recording and inactivation sessions. The task required integration of an allocentric position hypothesis with visual landmarks (Extended Data Fig. 1i,j). After mice learned the task—quantified as reaching a hit rate of above 30% in the simple conditions (high eccentricity; Extended Data Fig. 1j)—they were given access to unrestricted water and implanted following the procedure described for the main experiment but, instead of a chronic drive implant, a removable cap was implanted and two burr holes were prepared above RSC and covered with dental cement (Extended Data Fig. 1k). After recovery from surgery, mice were put back on water restriction over the course of 1 week and reintroduced to the task. Before each experiment, mice were anesthetized briefly with isoflurane, the cap was opened temporarily and the exposed skull was wiped with lidocaine and an injection of either 50 nl of 1 μg ml−1 muscimol solution in cortex buffer per side, or the same volume of cortex solution was performed through the existing burr holes. Mice were left to recover from anesthesia for 15 min and tested on the task. Performance was assessed as the hit rate on the first port visit per trial, and confidence level were computed using the Clopper–Pearson method for binomial confidence intervals (CIs) at the 95% level.

After mice had undergone surgery, they were given at least 1 week to recover before water scheduling began. Initially, mice received 3 ml of water per day in the form of 3 g of HydroGel (ClearH2O), which was reduced gradually to 1.0–1.5 g per day. During this period, mice were handled by experimenters and habituated to the arena. Throughout the entire experiment mice were given water rewards for completion of the task and were given additional water to maintain their total water intake at 1.25–1.5 ml.

After initial acclimation to the recording arena over 2 days, mice were trained on the task. Throughout the task we used white circular cues on the floor (referred to as landmarks) of ~30-mm diameter on a black background. These landmarks were the only source of light in the experiment. Mice were run every day or every other day, for a single session of 30 min to 3 h per day. Training progressed in several phases:

Initially, mice were trained that circular visual cues on the floor of the arena indicated reward locations. One of the 16 ports was selected randomly as reward port and a cue was shown in front of this port. Visiting an incorrect port resulted in a time out (~1 s initially, increased later), during which the entire arena floor was switched to gray leading to a widespread visual stimulus. Visiting the correct port resulted in an audible beep from the beeper located in the port and around 0.005 ml of water were delivered by the syringe pump. After a reward, a new reward port was chosen randomly, and the landmark was rotated together with the port, effectively performing a rotation of the entire task, and the next trial began. This meant that mice learned to not rely on any cues other than the visual landmark to locate the correct port. Mice usually completed this phase in by day 4.

We then introduced a new task phase, referred to in the text as ‘dot-hunting' task: after each reward, the landmark disappeared and instead a blinking dot was shown in a random location in the arena. If the mouse walked over that dot, it disappeared and either a new dot in a new random location appeared, repeating the process, or the next trial was initiated. The number of required dots–chases was sampled uniformly from a range and was increased to six to eight by the time recordings began, and the last dot was always positioned at the arena center. This task phase served to obfuscate the rotation of the task. Data acquired during this task phase were used during spike sorting but were not part of the main dataset in which we analyzed hypothesis representation. We analyze this task phase separately in Fig. 3c and Extended Data Figs. 3h,i, 4 and 8. Mice learned this task phase, with six to eight dots, by day 7 on average.

Throughout phases 1 and 2, we progressively introduced a requirement for the mice to hold their snouts in the reward port for increasing durations to trigger a reward or time out. For each port visit, the required duration was drawn randomly from a uniform distribution, so on any given trial the mice did not know when exactly to expect to know the outcome of the port visit. Initially, this hold time was 500 ms, and the time range was slowly increased throughout training, depending on animal performance. By the time recordings began, a range of around 4–6 s was used. Mice were able to tolerate this holding time by day 20 on average.

Next, we introduced an identical second landmark at a nonrewarded port. Initially, the two landmarks were set two ports apart (for example, ports 1 and 3), and this distance was progressively increased to four or five ports. As before, the rewarded port and landmarks were rotated randomly after each trial, but their relative positions remained stable. Visiting the reward port at the incorrect, ‘a' landmark (and holding there for the required duration) was handled identically to visits to any other nonreward port and triggered the same time out. As a result, mice learned to visit the ‘b' port. Mice learned to make an initial distinction between the ports approximately by day 14–16. In one mouse, we maintained this training phase until overall task performance was significant over entire sessions (Extended Data Fig. 1f), but we noticed that the mouse had trouble consistently relearning the next task phase. We therefore transitioned subsequent mice to the next phases before a stable behavior was established.

After the mice started learning to visit the port at the ‘b' landmark, we introduced a view distance limitation that made landmarks invisible from far away: the mouse's position was tracked at 30 Hz and, for each landmark, its brightness was modulated in real time as a function of the mouse's distance from it. The visibility was 0 for distances above a threshold, 1 for distances below a second threshold and transitioned linearly between the two values. For clarity, we draw only the first threshold where landmarks initially become visible in the illustrations. The second threshold was typically set to about 50% of the first, leading to a gradual brightening, but in the otherwise totally dark arena, almost any values >1 are clearly visible. Initially, thresholds were set so that both landmarks were visible from the arena center (~20 cm); they were then reduced progressively to values where, at any one time, only one of the landmarks was visible to the mouse (~10 cm). At this stage, mice that encounter a landmark after a new trial starts have no way of knowing whether this is the rewarded or nonrewarded landmark, unless they infer landmark identity via path integration (See Fig. 2e right or Extended Data Fig. 2e). Recordings began when mice were able to complete 100 trials per hour at a hit/miss rate >1. Mice reached this criterion level on average by total day 30–40 of training.

Statistical tests were carried out in Matlab (Mathworks, v.2019) using built-in functions. Unless stated otherwise, CIs were computed at a 95% level using bootstrap, and P values were computed using a Mann–Whitney U test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. In figures, significance values are indicated as nonsignificant (NS) (P > 0.05), *(P ≤ 0.05), **(P ≤ 0.01) or ***(P ≤ 0.001). No statistical method was used to predetermine sample sizes.

Recording sessions were included once mice performed the task well enough to achieve a session average hit/miss ratio >1, indicating that mice could infer the correct port between the ‘a' and ‘b' landmarks (a correct rate of >1/16 would indicate that they can associate landmarks with rewarded ports, but not that they can infer landmark identity). Because landmarks are visible sequentially only after full training, a ratio >1 shows that mice employed a memory based strategy where they used a previous hypothesis derived from seeing or not seeing the first landmark, together with path integration, to infer the identity of the second landmark they encounter. Only sessions with at least 50 recorded single neurons, and with at least 50 min of task performance were included. This yielded 16 sessions from four mice. For some analyses, particularly for analyses where trajectories of the mice were matched across trial types to control for potential motor and sensory confounds, additional selection criteria were applied yielding a lower number of sessions that could be used, this is stated for the respective analyses. For plots of the learning rates, we included trials where mice encountered their first landmark after 20 s or faster to exclude periods where mice were not engaged.

For analysis, each trial was split into epochs: the time between the onset of a trial (right after the mouse completes the preceding reinitialization procedure, and finds itself at the center of the arena, unsure of its orientation relative to the currently invisible landmarks) and the onset of the reward (the first time the mouse could know whether it reached the correct port, other than by process of elimination after visiting all other ports) was split up based on the amount of information the mouse could have accumulated: the initial state when mice had not seen any landmark was labeled ‘LM0,' time after the first landmark encounter was labelled ‘LM1,' and after the second encounter as ‘LM2'. The timepoints when landmarks became visible and the mouse transitioned from LM0 to LM1 or from LM1 to LM2, referred to as ‘landmark encounters' were defined as the timepoint when landmark visibility exceeded 50%.

For analyses of the correlation of neural state and eventual behavioral outcomes, each second landmark encounter was further categorized as whether it occurred at the ‘a' or ‘b' landmark. For behavioral analyses in Fig. 4d, trials were further categorized by whether they led to a correct port visit or to a incorrect visit and a time out.

Changes in spatial tuning in individual RSC neurons as mice encounter successive landmarks (Fig. 1f) was quantified by the Euclidian distance of their spatial tuning profiles (in an 8 × 8 map, resulting in a 64-element vector, for each comparison nonvisited ties were omitted). As an internal control, distance between tuning profiles within condition and across condition were compared using nonoverlapping 1-min segments. The control levels are different between the cases because the amount of data per session, reliability of firing, and so on, is not constant, and each control is valid only for its test data. For each comparison (LM1 versus LM2 and LM0 versus LM1), the split spatial tuning maps were compared either within the conditions, for example, within LM1 and within LM2, and compared with distances between LM1 and LM2 maps.

All decoding analyses were performed on the entire neural population with no preselection. To decode the mouse position from RSC firing rates, neural firing rates were first low-pass filtered at 1 Hz with a single-pole Butterworth filter. The resulting firing rate time series were used to predict the mouse position as 100 categorical variables forming a 10 × 10 bin grid (bin width = 50 mm). The network was made up of a single long short-term memory (LSTM) layer with 20 units, and a fully connected layer into a softmax output into the 100 possible output categories. For analyses of intermediate information content of the decoder, the network input into the final softmax layer was analyzed.

Decoding was reinitialized for each trial. For each decoded trial, all other trials served as training set. For analysis of how the neural coding of position was dependent on the landmark state of the mouse (Extended Data Fig. 2a), the same analysis was repeated with training and testing data further divided by landmark state. For analysis of the decoding performance, the output likelihood from the decoder was evaluated at the mouse's true position for all positions that were shared across conditions for this session. Statistical analysis was then performed on a per session average likelihood (not weighted by number of trials per session).

For the analysis of landmark state (Fig. 1e), trials with at least 0.5 s of data from all three states were used (16 sessions, 486 total trials) and individual trials were held out from training for decoding. Firing rates were low-pass filtered with a causal single-pole Butterworth filter at 0.05 Hz, and landmark state (0, 1 or 2) was decoded independently for each timepoint using a categorical linear decoder (dummy variable coding, (Nneurons + 1) × 3 parameters), or a neural network with no recurrence, using a single 20-unit layer receiving instantaneous firing rates, into a six unit layer and into three softmax outputs. Training data were balanced across conditions. For related analyses of hypothesis state decoding, see also Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 9j, where we decode form position-matched timepoints to account for location, motor and visual confounds, and Extended Data Fig. 7 where we match for position.

To show that mice can gain information by not encountering a landmark (as is shown, for example, by the ANN example in Fig. 2), we analyzed cases where the mouse first encounters a landmark, and then, in the LM1 state, encounters the position where another landmark could be, but fails to see one. We note that this analysis has unavoidable confounds, as in one condition the mouse gets salient visual input, in the other it does not. We consequently ignored these cases in the main analysis, and instead concentrated on cases where visual input was matched, but previous hypotheses differ (Fig. 4). We analyze these nonencounters by decoding the associated state change with the same method as in ‘Neural decoding of landmark state,' but with nonbalanced conditions, due to the lower trial count, and analysis of the prediction around the 0-s point.

PCA was performed by first computing the covariance matrices of the low-pass filtered (as before) firing rates, and plotting their eigenvalue spectra, normalized by sum (Extended Data Fig. 8c). Each scaled eigenvalue corresponds to a proportion of explained variance. Spectra are plotted together with a control spectrum computed from covariances of randomly shuffled data. For a description of the method used to compute the correlation dimension of RSC rates (Extended Data Fig. 8d), see the heading ‘Correlation dimension' in the section about ANN methods below.

For quantification of the independence of individual RSC neurons from the surrounding RSC population (Extended Data Fig. 8f,g), the firing rates of each neuron were predicted from those of all other neurons using linear regression. Rates were first filtered at 0.01–0.5 Hz with a third-order Butterworth filter, and subsampled to 3.3 Hz. Each neuron's rate was predicted with L1 regularized linear regression51 (\({\rm{lasso}},\lambda \approx 0.0001\)) from the rates of all other neurons and preceding firing rates using eight lags (~0.2.5 s). Goodness of fit was quantified as the proportion of variance explained, \({R}^{2}=1-{\sum }_{i}{({Y}_{i}-{Y}_{i}^{{\rm{pred}}})}^{2}/{\sum }_{i}{\left({Y}_{i}-\bar{Y}\right)}^{2}\). Predictions were computed both within condition (LM1, LM2 and dot-hunting phase), as well as across conditions, where the model was fit using coefficients determined from the other conditions.

Entropies of empirical firing rate distributions were computed in bits according to their Shannon entropy, \(H\left(X\right)=-{\sum }_{i=1}^{n}P\left({x}_{i}\right){\log }_{2}P({x}_{i})\), relative to a uniform histogram of the same size, \(\hat{H}\left(X\right)=-\left(H\left(X\right)-H\left({\rm{uniform}}\right)\right)\). In cases where zeros appeared, a small offset term <<1 was added and all histograms were normalized to a sum of 1. For example, \(\hat{H}\left(\left[1,0\right]\right)=\hat{H}\left(\left[1,1,0,0\right]\right)=1\,{\rm{bit}}\), and \(\hat{H}\left(\left[1,1,1,1.3\right]\right)\cong 0.01\,{\rm{bit}}\). For the analysis in Fig. 1g, a 8 × 8 grid was used for spatial coding, and three bins for the state coding. Although the 8 × 8 grid is coarse enough to allow accurate capture of the spatial firing rate profile even for low-rate cells, the resulting estimates could be minimally affected by firing rate differences between neurons.

For analysis of whether partial hypothesis representation in the LM1 state corresponds to trial-by-trial changes in firing rates, evident in bimodal firing rate histograms, histograms of hidden unit firing rates of the ANN, conditioned on binned 1D position are displayed (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Data are from Experiment configuration 2 (‘Overview over experiment configurations used with ANNs'). Tuning curves were calculated using 20 bins of location/displacements and normalized individually for each neuron. The first timestep in each trial and timesteps with nonzero landmark input were excluded from the analysis. For histograms, each condition was binned in 100 column bins and neuron rates in ten row bins. Histograms were normalized to equal sum per column. For analysis of RSC firing rates (Extended Data Fig. 7b–d), we did not observe bimodal rate distributions and instead quantified the dispersion of the rate distributions according to their entropy: firing rates were low-pass filtered at 0.5 Hz to bring them into the timescale of navigation behavior, and firing rate histograms were computed with eight bins spanning from each neurons lowest to highest firing rate per neuron, for each spatial bin in a 4 × 4 grid. Because the computation of histogram entropy is biased by the number of samples, for each spatial bin, the same number of timepoints were used for the LM1 and LM2 conditions. The dispersion of the firing rate distribution was then computed as average entropies per cell across all space bin, and compared across the two conditions.

Firing rate profiles were analyzed in two reference frames, that is, global angle of the mouse in the arena, and relative angle to the last visible landmark. Only timepoints from the foraging state where the distance of mouse from the center of the arena exceeded 70% of the arena diameter were included. Timepoints from the LM1 and LM2 conditions were subsampled to yield matched number of timepoints. Firing rates were analyzed in a −π to π range in six bins by computing their entropy as described before.

Recordings were split into LM[0,1,2] states as before, firing rates were low-pass filtered at 1 Hz, and the Pearson correlation coefficient between each pair of neurons was computed. For display purposes, the neurons were reordered by first computing the matrix for the LM1 state, applying hierarchical clustering52, and the resulting reordering was applied to both LM1 and LM2 conditions. This reordering has no impact on any further analyses. For summary statistics, we computed the correlation of correlations for each session. We observed no systematic change in the results as a function of the low-pass cutoff frequency, see Extended Data Fig. 8e for a comparison of a 1-Hz versus a 5-Hz cutoff.

Neural firing rates were bandpass filtered as before, and an initial smoothing and dimensionality reduction step was performed by training a small LSTM with a single layer of 30 units to decode the mouse position. The hidden unit activations were then embedded in 3D space with the isomap algorithm53, using the Toolbox for Dimensionality Reduction by Laurens van der Maaten54.

For quantification of how fast the neural state evolves, the firing rates of the entire population were computed by low-pass filtering the spike trains at 1 Hz (third-order Butterworth filter), and the speed of the five largest principal components of the resulting vector in Hz s−1 were related to the running speed of the mouse (m s−1, also low-pass filtered at 1 Hz) or the change in landmark brightness (percent per second) (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Data were binned in 30 bins from 0 to 0.5 m s−1 and ten bins from 0.5 to 2 m s−1 for running speed and ten bins from −50 to 50% and ten bins for ±50–200%. CIs were computed by treating median data from each session as independent samples.

To study the encoding of context with minimal sensory and motor confounds (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 9), we split the appearances of the second landmark into two groups depending on whether the second landmark is ‘a' or ‘b,' as described in the main text. We then selected subsets of trials manually where egocentric paths just before the appearance of the second landmark are matched across the two groups. Figure 4a shows an example of such matched approach paths/trials. Sessions in which at least 16 trials could be matched were used for these analyses, yielding a total of 133 trials from six sessions (per session, 16, 23, 24, 24, 25 and 21). For each session, all of these trials were aligned to the time when the second landmark became visible, yielding a set of time ranges where the animals experienced similar visual inputs, performed similar locomotion behavior but potentially encoded different previous experience leading them to subsequently disambiguate the perceptually identical second landmark as ‘a' or ‘b.'

To test whether there was consistent encoding of this context in RSC, we then compared the distances across these groups in 3D neural activity space (‘Low-dimensional embedding of neural activity') to distances within the groups (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 9). This test was performed at the point where the second landmark became visible to assess encoding of previous context, as well as 200 ms afterwards to assess how the identity of the (now visible) landmark affects encoding in RSC.

To assess whether neural trajectories were determined by population dynamics that were stable across trials and could therefore serve as substrate for the computation performed by the mice, we tested whether neural trajectories behaved consistent with a laminar flow regime where neighboring particles (in our case, neural firing rate vectors) remain neighbors for a significant amount of time, or whether they decorrelate quickly (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 9e,f). To assess temporal dynamics of the neural spiking without imposing any smoothing, we investigated raw spike counts in 750-ms windows for this analysis. For each session, an initial set of pairwise high-dimensional distances in spike counts between the trials with egocentrically similar paths (‘Analysis of context-encoding in RSC across similar motor and sensory states') was computed from the last 750 ms preceding the appearance of the second landmark. These distances were then correlated with those in a second sliding window; Extended Data Fig. 9f). An offset of 0 s was defined as the point where both windows stopped overlapping. The correlation coefficient R was then computed for increasing window offset up to 2 s. Summary statistics were computed across sessions by first shifting each session individually by its 95% level for R (from a shuffled control which removed the relationship between cells) which results in the summary plot showing a highest value for R of ~0.8 even for offsets where the windows fully overlap and the uncorrected R value is 1. Because of this offset, the null level for each trial is now at R = 0. We then computed the CIs for the group by bootstrap relative to this level.

To illustrate the joint encoding of position and task states (as sketched conceptually in Fig. 4f) using neural data, we decoded the hypothesis state, as well as x/y position from firing rates (Fig. 4e). Individual trials were held out as test set, an ANN was trained on the remaining trials and the resulting predictions in the test trial were plotted with hypothesis state in z and x/y in x/y dimensions. True LM0, 1a and 1b states were indicated with same colors as throughout the figure. Rates were low-pass-filtered with a causal third-order Butterworth filter at 0.5 Hz to bring rates into the behavioral timescale. For position decoding, the network architecture was filtered rates > 20-unit LSTM layer > 15-unit LSTM > 6-unit LSTM > 2 element regression output (mouse x/y position). For hypothesis states, rates > 10-unit LSTM > single regression layer, with LM0 encoded at 0, and LM1a and b as −1 and +1, respectively. This analysis was not used to make statistical statements. Instead, we tested x/y encoding in Fig. 1, and hypothesis encoding in Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 9 with statistical methods.

To further test whether neural trajectories were determined by population dynamics that were stable across trials, and were independent of the interpretation of the second (locally ambiguous) landmark, we tested whether neural activity evolved in similar directions across trials if it started close together in 3D neural activity space (‘Low-dimensional embedding of neural activity') (Extended Data Fig. 9g,h). We therefore looked at neural trajectories within the motor and sensory-matched LM2 approaches where the neural state at the point where the second landmark became visible started neurally close to other trials from the opposing class. For example, for an LM2a trial, we examined whether this trial might follow other close-by LM2b trials. We computed neural proximity in the 3D neural embedding (see above) and defined close-by trials as ones that were within 1 a.u. in Euclidean distance in the isomap embedding around the time when the second landmark became visible, yielding a total of 42 out of 79 trials with close neighbors from opposing classes from the five sessions (one session was excluded because the neural activity in the relevant time ranges was collapsed onto a point in the LSTM embedding). As a control, we also selected corresponding neurally furthest points. Similarity of neural evolution was then quantified as the angular difference between the trials in (3D) LSTM space over time, to assess coevolution independently of the initial selection by distance. Significance was computed by bootstrap across trials versus random alignments corresponding to a 90-degree difference.

For the behavior prediction analysis, sessions with at least five correct and incorrect port visits after the second landmark visit were used (N = 11) and an equal number of hit and miss trials (outcome of next port visit is a time out or a correct) were selected, leading to a chance prediction level of 0.5. The spike rates from the 5 s preceding the second landmark becoming visible, binned into 1-s bins, were used to predict the behavioral outcome with a binary classification decision tree with a minimum leaf size of six, previously determined using cross-validation. Predictions for each trial were fit using all other trials.

We trained a decoder to predict either the number of encountered dots in the main task, or in the dot-hunting task. These tasks were interleaved, and the same neurons were used (Extended Data Fig. 4). Train and test sets were split by trial, and decoding was performed with a regression tree on low-pass-filtered firing rates as before, performance was quantified as mean error on the number of landmarks. Only the first two landmarks were predicted in the dot-hunting task to allow use of the same classifier across both. Decoding performance was compared between the within-class (for example, decode main task encounters with decoder trained on other trials in the main task) and cross-class (for example, decode dot-hunting from decoder trained on the main task, and so on).

To test whether the encoding of hypothesis states in RSC is specific to task performance, we analyzed a larger number of sessions from the entire period during which two landmarks with local visibility were used (92 recording sessions in total) (Extended Data Fig. 4). We analyzed the effect of task performance on the behavior prediction analysis (as described above; Extended Data Fig. 4). We also analyzed the more general decoding of landmark encounter count (same method as in ‘Specificity of landmark encounter coding to the foraging task'; Fig. 1) in all of the 92 sessions with two landmarks, and correlated decoding performance with task performance on a per session level. As an additional control, we performed the same analysis on the number of dots encountered in the interleaved dot-hunting task. For all of these analyses, we used an analogous method as for the nonbehavior-correlated analyses.

We chose a simple recurrent neural network as one of the simplest architectures that can learn to maintain state over time. Unless stated in the text, the default architecture consisted of rate neurons with an input layer into 128 hidden recurrent units (tanh nonlinearity) into 80 output neurons, trained on random velocity trajectories in random environments of up to four landmarks (see ‘Network architecture and training' for details). For the analyses in the main text, landmark inputs were relayed to the ANN as a map that encoded their relative position but not identity (‘external map' ANN, 80 input neurons). The findings were replicated with an ANN that received only binary landmark presence input (‘internal map' ANN, 11 input neurons) and non-negative ANNs (Extended Data Fig. 10), on a subset of environments. The ANN serves to establish whether and how recurrent systems could solve the task, and we make no connections between the circuitry of RSC and the connections in the ANN.

A simulated animal runs with varying velocity in a circular environment starting from a random unknown position and eventually infers its position using noisy velocity information and two, three or four indistinguishable landmarks. A trial consists of a fixed duration of exploration in a fixed environment, starting from an unknown starting location; the environment can change between trials. Environments are generated by randomly drawing a constellation of two to four landmarks, and the network must generalizably localize in any of these environments when supplied with its map. The network must adjust its spatial inference computations on the basis of the configurations of the different environments, without changing its weights; thus, the adjustments must be dynamic. In the internal map scheme (Extended Data Fig. 10a–m), an input cell simply encodes by its activation whether the animal is at any landmark; it does not specify the location of the landmark, the identity of the environment, or the spatial configuration of the various landmarks in the environment. The task in the internal map scheme is substantially harder, since the network must infer the configuration of landmarks in the environment purely from the time sequence of landmark visits, while simultaneously localizing itself within the environment. Information about the maps must be acquired and stored within the network. To make the task tractable, we limit training and testing in the internal map setting to four specific environments.

In the external map task (Figs. 2 and 3 and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 5–7), landmark locations were random and the set of locations (map) were provided to the network, whereas in the internal map task (Extended Data Fig. 10a–m) one of four landmark configurations was used, but the maps were not provided to the network. Landmarks could be observed only for a short distance. A three-layer network with a recurrent hidden layer was trained to infer location. Velocity and landmark encounter information were encoded in the input layer, and all weights of the network were trained. The training target for the output layer was activation of a unit with von Mises tuning and preferred location matching the true location.

Network performance was compared with a number of alternative algorithms: path integration plus correction integrated the noisy velocity information starting from an initial location guess and corrected this estimate by a reset to the coordinates of the nearest landmark when a landmark was encountered. Particle filters approximated sequential Bayesian inference given the available velocity and landmark information, with each particle capturing a location hypothesis whose posterior probability is given by an associated weight. Particle locations are updated using velocity information and particles are reweighted after landmark encounters. The enhanced particle filter also reweights particles when a landmark is expected but not encountered, thus can infer location not only from the presence but also from the absence of landmarks. The output and hidden representations of the trained network were evaluated in a variety of conditions involving both random and fixed landmark locations and trajectories with random and fixed velocities.

The task is defined by a simulated animal moving along a circular track of radius 0.5 m for 10 s. The animal starts at a random, unknown position along the circle at rest and starts running along a trajectory at nonconstant velocity. A trajectory is sampled every dt = 0.1 s in the following way: at each time t, acceleration at is sampled from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with s.d. σa = π/4 m s−2 that is truncated if |at | > π/2 m s−2. Acceleration is integrated to obtain the velocity vt and truncated if |vt | > vmax = π/2 m s−1. The actual location on the track is the integral of this velocity.

In a trial of the external map task, the locations of K = 2, 3 or 4 indistinguishable landmarks were determined sequentially: the first landmark was sampled from a uniform random distribution on the circle, with subsequent landmarks also sampled from a uniform random distribution but subject to the condition that the minimum angular distance from any previously sampled landmark is at least δ = π/9 rad.

The internal map task involved four environments, each with a unique configuration of landmarks: two environments had two landmarks, one had three and the last had four. Landmark locations in the four environments were chosen so that pairwise angular distances were sufficiently unique to allow the inference of environment identity. Landmark coordinates in environment ei were given by: e1 = {0, 2π/3} rad, e2 = {1.9562, 3.7471} rad, e3 = {0.2641, 1.2920, 3.7243} rad and e4 = {3.0511, 3.8347, 5.1625, 5.7165} rad.

After training, the networks were evaluated in different testing configurations that each consisted of a distribution over landmark configurations and trajectories:

Training distribution: this test set was generated exactly as in the training set, as described in ‘Definition of environments and trajectories'.

Fixed landmarks, random trajectories: the landmark configuration was given by two landmarks located at e = {0, 2π/3}, the trajectories were sampled in an identical way as in the training distribution. Note that this landmark configuration corresponds to the first environment in the internal map task.

Fixed landmarks, constant velocity trajectories: the landmark configuration was given by two landmarks located at e = {0, 2π/3} and the trajectories were given by constant velocity trajectories with |vt | = vmax/2. The initial position and the direction of the trajectory was random.

Two variable landmarks, constant velocity trajectory: the landmark configuration was given by two landmarks located at e = {0, 2π/3 + απ/3}, where α ϵ [0, 1]. The trajectories were given by constant velocity trajectories with |vt | = vmax/2 and the initial position and the direction of the trajectory was random.

Two environments, random trajectories: the landmark configuration was given by either e1 or e2 of the internal map task, trajectories are random.

The animal is considered to have encountered a landmark if it approached within dmin = vmax × dt/2 = π/40 m−2 = π/20 rad. This threshold is large enough to prevent an animal from ‘missing' a landmark even if it is running at maximum velocity. This ‘visibility radius' is smaller than the one we used for the mouse behavior experiments (Fig. 1). In the ANN experiments, landmark encounters were therefore roughly coincident with the agent's position coinciding with the landmark, whereas in the mouse data, landmark encounters occur a significant distance away from the landmark, when it becomes visible (for example, Fig. 4a). In the same way as in the mouse behavior analysis, hovering around the same landmark or approaching the same landmark consecutively would trigger a landmark encounter only at the first approach; a new encounter was triggered only if the animal approached an landmark different from the previous one, equivalent to the definition used in the analysis of mouse behavior. Also, only trials in which the animal encountered at least two different landmarks were included.

The largest sources of uncertainty in the tasks were the unknown starting position and the indistinguishability of the landmarks. In addition, we assumed that the velocity information and the landmark location memory (in the external map scenario) were corrupted by noise. At each timestep of size dt = 0.1, the velocity input to the network corresponded to the true displacement vdt corrupted by zero-mean Gaussian noise of standard deviation σv = vmaxdt/10. In the external map task, the landmark map provided to the network and particle filter was corrupted by zero-mean Gaussian noise with standard deviation σl = π/50 rad, without changing the relative landmark positions: The map was coherently slightly rotated at a landmark encounter, and the rotation was sampled independently at each landmark encounter.

This analysis was performed by evaluating the network of the external map task on the experiment configuration 1 of the internal map task (Extended Data Fig. 2c). First, location tuning curves were determined after the second landmark encounter using 5,000 trials from distribution 1 and using 50 location bins. Tuning curves were calculated separately for each of the four environment of the internal map task. Preferred location was determined to be the location corresponding to the tuning curve maximum. The density of preferred locations smaller than distance dmin away from a landmark was then compared with the density of preferred locations further away from landmarks.

The network consisted of three layers of rate neurons with input-to-hidden, hidden-to-hidden and hidden-to-output weights. All weights were trained.

The input layer consisted of 80 neurons in the external map case and 11 neurons in the internal map case. Ten neurons coded for velocity corrupted by noise (noise as described above). The velocity neurons had a minimum firing rate between 0 and 0.2 and a maximum firing rate between 0.8 and 1 in arbitrary units, and within this output range coded linearly for the whole range of velocity between −vmax and vmax. Negative and positive velocity here corresponds to CW and CCW travel, respectively.

The remaining neurons (70 in the external map case and 1 in the internal map case) coded for landmark input and were activated only at the timestep of, and up to, three timesteps after a landmark encounter. In the external map case, the landmark input simultaneously encoded the locations of all landmarks in the environment, thus supplying a map of the environment, but contained no information about which LM was currently encountered. The LM neurons had von Mises tuning with preferred locations xj = (j − 1) × 2π/70 rad, j = 1…70, that tiled the circle equally. Given n landmarks at locations li, i = 1…n, the firing rate of the j-th landmark input neuron was given by

where \(\widetilde{{l}_{i}}\sim N\left({l}_{i},{\sigma }_{l}^{2}\right)\) is the noise-corrupted landmark coordinate (‘Sensory noise'). This mixture of von Mises activation hills produces the pattern depicted as the ‘map' input in Extended Data Fig. 5a.

In the internal map case (Extended Data Fig. 10a–m), the landmark input neuron consisted of a single binary neuron that responded for four timesteps with activation 1 in arbitrary units whenever a landmark was encountered. This input encoded neither environment identity nor landmark location.

The hidden layer consisted of 128 recurrently connected neurons. The activation ht of hidden layer neurons at timestep t was determined by ht = tanh(Wxxt + Whht − 1 + b), where xt are the activations of input neurons at timestep t, Wx are the input-to-hidden weights, Wh are the hidden-to-hidden weights and b are the biases of hidden neurons. The nonlinearity should be considered as an effective nonlinearity at long times; since the timestep dt = 0.1 s was large compared with a typical membrane time constant (τ ≈ 0.02 s), we did not include an explicit leak term.

In the non-negative network (Extended Data Fig. 10n–t), the recurrent activation was determined by ht = tanh([Wxxt + Whht−1 + b]+), where [u]+ denotes rectification.

The output layer consisted of a population of 70 neurons with activity ot given by ot = tanh(Woht + bo), where Wo are the output weights and bo the biases of the output neurons.

The training targets of the output layer were place cells with von Mises tuning of width σo = π/6 rad to the true location yt,

where zα, α = 1…70 are the equally spaced preferred locations of each training target.

The network was trained by stochastic gradient descent using the Adam algorithm55, to minimize the average square error between output ot and training targets \({\tilde{{o}}_{t}}\), with the average taken over neurons, time within each trial and trials. The gradients were clipped to 100. The training set consisted of 106 independently generated trials. During training, performance was monitored on a validation set of 1,000 independent trials and network parameters with the smallest validation error were selected. All results were cross-validated on a separate set of test trials to ensure that the network generalized across new random trajectories and/or landmark configurations.

Given the activity of the output layer at time t, we define the network location estimate for that time to equal the preferred location (the preferred location was set over training) of the most active output neuron:

In Fig. 2b, we compared the performance of the network in the external map task with a number of alternative algorithms. To ensure a fair comparison, we make sure that each alternative algorithm has access to exactly the same information as the network: the landmark identities are indistinguishable and both velocity and landmark location information are corrupted by the same small amount of sensory noise. Error statistics were computed from 5,000 trials.

This algorithm implements path integration and landmark correction using a single location estimate, similar to what is implemented in hand-designed continuous attractor networks that implement resets at boundaries or other landmarks15,16,56,57. The algorithm starts with an initial location estimate at y = 0 (despite the true initial location being random and unknown), and integrates the noise-corrupted velocity signal to obtain location. At each landmark encounter, the algorithm corrects its location estimate to equal the coordinates of the landmark nearest to its current estimate.

Particle filters implement approximate sequential Bayesian inference using a sampling-based representation of the posterior distribution. Here, the posterior distribution over location at each timepoint is represented using a cloud of weighted particles, each of which encodes through its weights a belief, or estimated probability, of being at a certain location. In the beginning of the trial, Np = 1,000 particles are sampled from a uniform distribution along the circle and weighted equally. In the prediction step, particles are propagated independently using a random walk whose mean is the noise-corrupted velocity update and whose s.d. is the velocity noise σv. In the absence of a landmark encounter, particle weights remain unchanged and the particle cloud diffuses. If a landmark is encountered, the importance weights wt,β of particles β = 1…Np are multiplied by

where yt,β are the current estimates of the particles, and the weights are subsequently normalized such that \({\sum }_{\beta }{w}_{t,\beta }^{2}=1\). If the effective number of particles becomes too small, that is, \({N}_{\text{eff}}=1/{\sum }_{\beta }{w}_{t,\beta }^{2} < {N}_{p}/5\), the particles are resampled using low variance sampling58 and the weights equalized. This resampling step both allows for better coverage of probabilities and permits the particle cloud to sharpen again. The particle filter estimate at a given timepoint is given by the weighted circular mean \({\hat{y}}_{t}={{\arg }}({\sum }_{\beta }{w}_{t,\beta }\exp (i{y}_{t,\beta }))\) of the particle locations. In addition, we also calculate the circular variance as \(\mathrm{var}\left({y}_{t}\right)=1-\left|{\sum }_{\beta }{w}_{t,\beta }\exp \left(i{y}_{t,\beta }\right)\right|\).

This particle filter has identical initialization, prediction step and weight update at landmark encounters as the basic particle filter and proceeds in exactly the same way until the first landmark encounter. Subsequently, the enhanced particle filter can also use the absence of expected landmark encounters to narrow down its location posterior, similar to the network's ability shown in Extended Data Fig. 5. This is implemented in the following way: if a particle comes within the observation threshold δ of a possible landmark location but no landmark encounter occurs, the particle is deleted by setting its weight to zero; afterwards the particle weights are renormalized. A complication to this implementation is that a subsequent landmark encounter only occurs if the current landmark is different than the previous one (‘landmark encounters'); to prevent the deletion of particles that correctly report a landmark at the current position but do not receive a landmark encounter signal because it is the same landmark as previously encountered, particles are deleted only if they come within the observation threshold δ to a possible landmark that is different than the last landmark and do not encounter it. In case all particles have been deleted, particles are resampled from a uniform distribution and their weights are equalized. As for the basic particle filter, particles are resampled whenever the effective number of particles becomes too small \({N}_{\text{eff}}=1/{\sum }_{\beta }{w}_{t,\beta }^{2} < {N}_{p}/5\). The particle filter estimate \({\hat{y}}_{t}={{\arg }}({\sum }_{\beta }{w}_{t,\beta }\exp (i{y}_{t,\beta }))\) and the circular variance \(\mathrm{var}\left({y}_{t}\right)=1-\left|{\sum }_{\beta }{w}_{t,\beta }\exp \left(i{y}_{t,\beta }\right)\right|\) are also calculated in an identical way.

The timing and accuracy of location disambiguation in Extended Data Fig. 5 was calculated in the following way: we first constructed the trajectory of the ‘alternative location hypothesis,' corresponding to the location estimates of a model animal that made the wrong location disambiguation at the first landmark encounter, but otherwise updated its location by the correct velocity. This trajectory is shifted relative to the true trajectory by a constant distance equal to the distance between the two landmarks. At each point in time, we then identified the two neurons in the output population whose preferred locations were closest to that of the true and alternative trajectory, respectively; the activation of these neurons roughly corresponded to the height of the activation bump corresponding to the true and alternative location hypothesis as seen in Extended Data Fig. 5c,d,h. The disambiguation time was defined as the earliest time after which either the true or alternative location bump height fell below a threshold of 0.1 and stayed beyond that threshold until the end of the trial. To determine the accuracy of location disambiguation the network estimate at the last landmark interaction was analyzed. If this network estimate was closer to the true than to the wrong landmark location the trial was categorized as a correct trial, otherwise it was categorized as an incorrect trial.

We performed PCA on the hidden neuron states from training trials to obtain the top three principal directions. We then projected network states obtained from the distribution of testing trials 2 or 3 (Supplementary Information) onto these principal directions. The resulting reduced-dimension versions of the hidden neuron states from testing trials are shown in Fig. 2 and Extended Data Figs. 5 and 10.

To calculate the correlation dimension for the ANN and RSC activity, we first performed linear dimensionality reduction (PCA) on hidden layer activations from the training trials, retaining 20 principal components. For RSC data, rates were first low-pass filtered at 0.5 Hz. In the 20-dimensional space, we randomly picked 1,000 base points (500 for RSC). From each of these base points, we estimated how the number of neighbors in a ball of radius R scales with R. The minimum ball radius was determined such that the logarithm of the number of neighbors averaged over base points was near 1. The maximum radius was set to ten times the minimum radius, and intermediate values for the radius were spaced equally on a log scale. The slope of the linear part of the relationship between the logarithm of number of neighbors versus ball radius determined the fractal dimension

(a) Schematic of task structure and timing. (b) Example trial schematic showing all possible task states (see Methods for more details). Landmarks were formed by white dots displayed on a screen which served as the floor of the arena. They were only made visible when mice crossed a distance threshold. Only one landmark was visible at a time in the final training stage. Nose-pokes were only registered after mice held their nose in the port for a randomly chosen delay period that was randomized for each visit and not known to the mouse. Incorrect port visits resulted in timeouts that were associated with a bright background across the entire arena. After each complete trial, which results in the reward state, mice are required to complete a separate task in which they need to ‘hunt' for a series of 4 to 8 randomly placed blinking dots on the arena floor. Each dot disappears as soon as the mouse reaches it, resulting either in a new random annulus, or initialization of the next trial. The next trial begins with a new random rotation of the landmarks and rewarded port. (c) Training phases (see Methods). Mice are trained with a single landmark first, then 2 landmarks at unlimited view distance, and finally a limited view distance. (d) Top: Experimental setup for electrophysiology and real-time mouse position tracking. The arena was placed on top of a commercial flat-screen TV that was used to display visual landmarks. A motorized commutator47 was used to reduce tether-induced torque on the mouse, and a real-time optical tracking system was used to regulate the visibility of the landmarks and to identify when the mouse reached any of the blinking dots in the dot-hunting task. Bottom: view of the arena from the top, showing a subset of the reward ports as well as the tracking camera and the motorized commutator. (e) Example excerpt of behavioral data, with state transitions. Landmark visits (black arrowheads) are defined as the point when new landmarks become visible. (f) Top: Training curves for all 4 mice. The three major training phases are indicated with shading (corresponding to panel c). Red: Proportion of time that a landmark is visible (remains 1.0 (100%) until view distance is introduced). Blue: Maximum reward port hold time for each session, the actual hold times are drawn from a uniform distribution. Black: proportion of hits / false positives (corresponds to rewards / timeouts, or proportion correct), for the 1st port visit in each trial. Values over 1/16 indicate that mice can distinguish the correct port amongst all ports. Values over 1 indicate that mice could reliably visit the correct port among the two ports indicated by locally ambiguous landmarks without excluding any other ports by trial and error (see main text and methods). Trials with 1st landmark visit after <20 sec are included in analysis. Grey: Proportion of trials in which mice see both landmarks, and then turn around to go back to the 1st landmark. If this proportion was 0, it would indicate that mice always visit the 2nd port after seeing it, which would on average lead to chance-level behavioral performance. For each individual session, significance of correct choice for the 1st port visit among the two indicated ports was tested with a binomial fit at the 95% level (two-sided, Clopper-Pearson exact method) and is indicated with a star. If the mouse also visited a large proportion of unmarked ports, this fraction can be significant despite the overall correct rate among all 16 ports being small. Bottom: latency to reward after encountering the 2nd landmark in seconds (blue), proportion of visits to ‘a' and ‘b' as fraction of all port visits (orange) and proportion correct choice between ‘a' or ‘b' with binomial 95% CI (binomial as described before, green). See y-axis labels for unit definitions. (g) All paths taken by the mouse in one example session, split by LM0,1,2 state (green, glue, grey). (h) 6 example trials from the same session plotted from the start of the trial to the reward delivery, same color scheme as in g. 2 of the trials include time-outs (red). (i) Retrosplenial cortex is required for integrating egocentric sensory information and hypotheses about the animal's allocentric location, but not for visually guided navigation. To causally test the role of RSC in relating spatial hypotheses to sensory data, we used a parametric allocentric/egocentric task using the same apparatus as in the main experiment and pharmacologically inactivated RSC. Schematic of task structure: Water restricted mice had to visit the port closest to a single visual landmark for a water reward. Visits to any other port resulted in a time-out, but allowed the mice to self-correct. As in the main experiment, the landmark and rewarded port were rotated randomly after each trial, forcing mice to use only the visual landmark. (j) To make the task reliant on allocentric hypotheses, we randomly varied the eccentricity of the landmark (center of the landmark to center of the arena, as fraction of the arena radius) at the beginning of each trial. Trials with low eccentricity (left) required the mouse to find the arena center (though path integration, requiring maintenance of a self-position hypothesis or memory in absence of persistence visual cues indicating the center of the arena) and then extrapolate a straight path through the landmark to the correct rewarded port. Alternatively, mice might triangulate which port is the closest to the landmark from the periphery. These strategies all require integration of self-location hypotheses with visual landmark information. Trials with high eccentricity (right) required merely walking to the port closest to the landmark. This design allowed us to test the role of RSC in the integration of location hypotheses with egocentric visual landmark information while simultaneously determining whether simpler visually-guided navigation was also affected. (k) RSC was either 1) transiently inactivated with Muscimol, 2) sham injected with cortex buffer, or 3) not injected (see methods). Each mouse was tested in both groups, with balanced ordering. (l) Task performance (mean and 95% confidence intervals for hit rate on 1st port visits per trial, via binomial bootstrap). Mice always performed above full chance level (1/16th, assuming they cannot make use of the landmark). Performance was selectively reduced by RSC inactivation for low eccentricity conditions where integration of location hypotheses and visual landmarks was required. Performance in the visually guided condition was only minimally affected.

(a) Location decoders (neural network, cross-validated per trial) do not generalize across landmark states, and LM1 carries less spatial information than LM2. Performance is measured by prediction likelihood in a 10×10 grid, means and shaded 95% CIs across sessions (N = 16 sessions). See Fig. 1f for test via spatial RF differences. (b) Left: Example ANN neuron tuning curves (from LM2) split by travel direction, speed, or location uncertainty (corresponding to LM0,1,2 states, derived from particle filter), showing conjunctive coding. Right: Three RSC example cells showing conjunctive coding of location vs. speed, and direction (Fig. 1d shows task phase vs. location). (c) Left: ANN neurons and, Right: RSC cells (N = 984 neurons) weakly preferentially fire at landmark locations. Top: distribution of locations where RSC cells fire most. Bottom: total average rates, split by LM1 and LM2. (d) Distribution of firing rates by angular position in the arena, same data as panel c. Blue: quantile of firing rates across population. Red: 95% CI of the mean across the population via bootstrap. Despite a small preference for the landmark locations, this effect is small compared to the overall variability on firing rates, and there is no systematic preference for cells to fire in proximity of one vs. the other landmark, even in the LM2 condition. (e) Information gain, which we study by analyzing landmark encounters, as transitions between LM0,1,2 states throughout the manuscript, can also occur when mice fail to encounter a landmark where one would be expected given some hypothesis (see Fig. 2e for an ANN example). These cases can also be decoded from neural activity, but cannot be directly compared to landmark encounters, as they don't offer the matched sensory input (that is no visual input vs. appearance of salient landmark) that we employ in Fig. 4 (mouse encounters 2nd landmark, but it is either ‘a' or ‘b'). These ‘virtual' landmark encounters were decoded with a cross-validated NN on a trial level and compared to real landmark encounters. The same decoder was then cross tested on the reverse condition (grey plot) to show that the neural code for encounters and non-encounters is different, as is expected from the different sensory inputs. Analysis as in Extended Data Fig. 9a, but plots are aligned to the value at the 0-second point, see Methods for details.

(c) Verification of drive implant locations in RSC via histology in all 4 mice. White arrowheads indicate electrolytic lesion sites. (d) Histograms of mean firing rates of all 984 neurons across LM0 (green), LM1 (blue), and LM2 (black) conditions. Neurons are treated as independent samples. Overall rates did not shift significantly across these states. (e) Relative per-neuron changes in firing rates across conditions. Despite the lack of a population-wide shift in average rates, the firing rates of individual cells varied significantly across conditions with heterogeneous patterns of rates. Each grouping shows rates per cell, relative to the rate in LM0 (left) LM1 (middle), and LM2 (right) as individual rates (grey lines and histograms). Bar graphs show the 50% and 95% quantiles. (f) Spatial firing profiles of 42 example neurons split by hypothesis state. Number insets denote Max. firing rate in Hz per condition. For clarity, missing data is that was not due to exclusion via landmark visibility in LM1 is plotted as the darkest color in each plot. (g) Spatial firing rate profiles for all neurons from one example session (52 total), from the main task phase. Profiles were computed in 25×25 bins, and individually normalized to their 99th percentile. (h) same as panel g, but from the separate trial initialization task (‘dot-hunting') in which mice had to hunt for a series of blinking dots that appeared in random positions. (i) 36 example neurons from multiple sessions and animals, chosen to represent the broad range of tuning profiles. For each neuron, the main task tuning and the ‘dot-hunting' are plotted together on the same brightness scale, normalized to their total maximal rate. In the dot-hunting task there is no conserved radial tuning due to the absence of consistent landmarks, however some cells retain angular spatial tuning due to olfactory cues in the arena. Tuning to eccentricity (distance to arena wall or center) is maintained across task phases in many neurons. Small numbers indicate maximum firing rates in Hz for each plot (color scale is same across the pairs).

(a) Foraging and dot-hunting tasks are interleaved, allowing comparisons of how the same neural population represents hypotheses. (b) We predict the number of encountered landmarks either within condition (for example foraging from foraging, each time using one trial as test, fitting to all others), or across. Only the first 2 landmarks were predicted to allow use of the same classifier across both despite the higher number of landmarks in the dot-hunting task. Train and test sets were split by trial. Decoding was done with a regression tree on low-pass filtered firing rates. Performance was quantified as mean error on the N of landmarks. (c) Example dot-hunting trial, the performance from using the foraging predictor is lower. (d) Summary stats from all sessions, means and bootstrapped CIs. The prediction is significantly better when using training data from the same category than when using the neural code from the other; for example dot-hunting to predict the foraging (P= ~0 / ~ 0 within vs. across categories for predicting dot-hunting and foraging landmark state), showing that hypothesis coding is task-specific. (e) To test whether hypothesis encoding is a specific function of task learning or a general feature of RSC, we examined whether coding persisted in case when mice performed the task but were not yet performing well. We first examined the ability to predict correct vs. incorrect port choice (same as in Fig. 4) as a function of per-session task performance. We analyzed data from sessions from the entire training period where the 2 landmarks were used, with at least 5 correct and 5 incorrect choices (N = 42 sessions), due to the closely spaced recordings, neurons might be re-recorded across sessions. On average we analyzed ~15-30 port visits per session (number of trials was unaffected by behavioral performance: CI of slope = [-7.7, 2.7], p = 0.33). Predictions were made as before with a test/train split on balanced hit/miss data with a regression tree. Prediction performance was at chance level ( ~ 47%, P = 0.81 vs. chance) for low performance sessions (total correct choice ratio of 0.8 or lower), and the same as in our initial analysis (Fig. 4) for sessions with high mouse performance ( ~ 66%, P = 0.00096 vs. chance). Overall, prediction performance was significantly correlated with task performance (P = 0.0014 vs. constant model). Individual mice are indicated with colored markers. (f) We also analyzed the more general decoding of landmark encounter count (same as Fig. 1) in all of the 92 sessions with 2 landmarks, and also found a significant correlation (p = 0.0045 vs. constant model), showing that hypothesis encoding throughout the task is driven by task learning. (g) As a control experiment, we tested whether decoding the number of landmarks encountered in the interleaved dot-hunting task might also be affected by task performance, if for instance the neural encoding and performance was a function of general spatial learning, habituation to the arena, motivation, etc., and we found this correlation to be flat (P = .6, CI for slope = [-0.17, 0.29]). We conclude that the encoding of hypothesis state is task-specific and a function of the mouse performing the task.

(a) Structure of the recurrent network. Input neurons encoded noisy velocity input with linear tuning curves (similar to speed cells in the entorhinal cortex60), and landmark information. In the standard setup (referred to as “external map”), the landmark input signaled the global configuration of landmarks (map). If there are K landmarks (all assumed to be perceptually indistinguishable), then whenever the animal encounters a landmark, the input provides a simultaneous encoding of all K landmark locations using spatially tuned input cells. Thus, the input encodes the map of the environment but does not disambiguate locations within it. This input can be thought of as originating from a distinct brain area that identifies the current environment and provides the network with its map. (b) Trajectories varied randomly and continuously in speed and direction. There were 2-4 landmarks at random locations. (c) Activity of output neurons ordered by preferred location as a function of time in an easy trial with two nearby landmarks and a constant velocity trajectory. Black arrows: landmark encounters. Thick black dashed line: time of disambiguation of location estimate in output layer. Thin red dashed line: true location. The network's decision on when to collapse its estimate is flexible, and dynamically adapts the decision time to task difficulty: When the task is harder because of the configuration of landmarks (the task becomes harder as the two landmarks approach a 180 degree separation because of velocity noise and the resulting imprecision in estimating distances; the task is impossible at 180 degree because of symmetry), the network keeps alive multiple hypotheses about its states across more landmark encounters until it is able to reach an accurate decision. Panels c,d,f,g show example trials from experiment configuration 4 (See Methods) with different values of landmark separation parametrized by α. (d) Same as c, but in a difficult trial with two landmarks almost opposite of each other. (e) Top: The ANN took longer to disambiguate its location in harder task configurations: average time until disambiguation as a function of landmark separation (Standard error bars are narrower than line width). Middle: Distribution of the number of landmark encounters until the network disambiguates location, as a function of landmark separation. Bottom: Fraction of trials in which the network location estimate is closer to the correct than the alternative landmark location at the last landmark encounter, as a function of landmark separation. Data from 10000 trials in experiment configuration 4, 1000 for each of the 10 equally spaced values of α. The performance of the ANN (Fig. 2 main text) can be compared to the much poorer performance achieved by a strategy of path integration to update a single location estimate with landmark-based resets (to the coordinates of the landmark that is nearest the current path-integrated estimate), Fig. 2b (black versus gray). The latter strategy is equivalent to existing continuous attractor integration models13,14 combined with a landmark- or border based resetting mechanism16,56,57,61, which to our knowledge is as far as models of brain localization circuits have gone in combining internal velocity-based estimates with external spatial cues. The present network goes beyond a simple resetting strategy, matching the performance of a sequential probabilistic estimator – the particle filter (PF) – which updates samples from a multi-peaked probability distribution over possible locations over time and is asymptotically Bayes-optimal (M = 1000 particles versus N = 128 neurons in network; Fig. 2b, lavender (PF) and green (enhanced PF)). Notably, the network matches PF performance without using stochastic or sampling-based representations, which have been proposed as possible neural mechanisms for probabilistic computation39,62. (f) Similar to c, but in a trial where the network disambiguates its location before the second landmark encounter. Yellow arrows mark times of landmark interactions if the alternative location hypothesis had been correct. Disambiguation occurs shortly after the absence of a landmark encounter at the first yellow arrow. (g) Similar to f, but in a trial where disambiguation occurs at the first landmark location, since no landmark has been encountered at the time denoted by the first gray arrow. (h) In the regular task where landmark identity must be inferred by the ANN, discrete hypothesis states (denoted LM0,1,2 throughout) emerge during the LM1 state. (j) If the ANN is instead given the landmark identity via separate input channels, it immediately identifies the correct location after the 1st landmark encounter and learns to acts as a simple path integration attractor without hypothesis states. Plots show ANN output as in c,d,g,f. (i,k) To quantify the separation of hypothesis states in the ANNs hidden states even in cases where such separation might not be evident in a PCA projection, we linearly projected hidden state activations onto the axis that separates the hypothesis states. The regular ANN shows a clear LM1 vs LM2 separation, but the ANN trained with landmark identity does not distinguish between these. (l) Population statistics for ANN with external map input. Scatter plot of enhanced particle filter (ePF) circular variance vs. estimate decoded from hidden layer of the network. 4000 trials from experiment configuration 1 were used to train a linear decoder on the posterior circular variance of the ePF from the activity of the hidden units and performance was evaluated on 1000 test trials. (m) Scatter plot of widths and heights of ANN tuning curves after the 2nd landmark encounter. Insets: example tuning curves corresponding to red dots. Unlike hand-designed continuous attractor networks, where neurons typically display homogeneous tuning across cells13,63,64, our model reproduces the heterogeneity observed in hippocampus and associated cortical areas. Tuning curves are from LM2 using 1000 trials from experiment configuration 2 using 20 location bins. Tuning height specifies the difference between the tuning curve maximum and minimum, and tuning width denotes the fraction of the tuning curve above the mean of maximum and minimum. (n) The distribution of recurrent weights shows that groups of neurons with strong or weak location tuning or selectivity have similar patterns and strengths of connectivity within and between groups: distribution of absolute connection strength between and across location-sensitive “place cells” (PCs) and location-insensitive “unselective cells” (UCs) in the ANN. The black line denotes the mean; s.e.m. is smaller than the linewidth. The result is consistent with data suggesting that place cells and non-place cells do not form distinct sub-networks, but are part of a system that collectively encodes more than just place information65. Location tuning curves were determined after the second landmark encounter using 5000 trials from distribution 1 and using 20 location bins. The resulting tuning curves were shifted to have minimum value 0 and normalized to sum to one. The location entropy of each neuron was defined to be the entropy of the normalized location tuning curve. Neurons were split in two equal sets according to their location entropy, where neurons with low entropy were defined as “place cells” (PCs) and neurons with high entropy were defined as “non-place cells” (UCs). Between and across PCs and UCs absolute connection strength was calculated as the absolute value of the recurrent weight between non-identical pairs. (o) Pairwise correlation structure30 is maintained across LM[1,2] states and environments. Corresponds to Fig. 3a. Top: Correlations in spatial tuning between pairs of cells in one environment after the 1st landmark encounter / LM1 (left), after the 2nd encounter / LM2, and in a separate environment in LM2 (right). The neurons are ordered according to their preferred locations in environment 1. Bottom: Example tuning curve pairs (normalized amplitude) corresponding to the indicated locations i-iv. Data from experiment configuration 1. (p) State-space activity of ANN is approximately 3-dimensional. Even when summed across all environments and random trajectories, the states still occupy a very low-dimensional subspace of the full state space, quantified by the correlation dimension as d ≈ 3 (left, see Methods). This measure typically overestimates manifold dimension66, and serves as an upper bound on the true manifold dimension. As a control, the method yields a much larger dimension (d = 14) on the same network architecture with large random recurrent weights (right); thus, the low-dimensional dynamics are an emergent property of the network when it is trained on the navigation task. Data from 5000 trial, recurrent weights were sampled i.i.d. from a uniform distribution Wh,ij ~ U([ − 1, 1]), then fixed across trials. The initial hidden state across trials was sampled from ht=0,i ~ U([ − 1, 1]). Data from 5000 trials from experiment configuration 1. (q) In the LM2 state, position on the rate-space attractor corresponds to location in the maze. State-space trajectories after second landmark encounter for random trajectories. Color corresponds to true location (plot shows 100 trials). (r) ANN with external map input implements a circular attractor structure: Hidden layer activity arranged by preferred location in an example trial shows a bump of activity that moves coherently. Black arrows: first two landmark encounters. Preferred location was determined after the second landmark encounter using 5000 trials from experiment configuration 1. (s) Left: Recurrent weight matrix arranged by preferred location of neurons (determined after the second landmark encounter using 5000 trials from experiment configuration 1) indicates no apparent ring structure, despite apparent bump of activity that moves with velocity inputs (panel a). Right: However, recurrent coupling of modes defined by output weights (defined by \({W}_{{out}}{W}_{{rec}}{W}_{{out}}^{T}\), where \({W}_{{rec}}\) are the recurrent weights and \({W}_{{out}}\) are the output weights) has a clear band structure. Connections between appropriate neural mixtures in the hidden layer – defined by the output projection of the neurons – therefore exhibit a circulant structure, but the actual recurrent weights do not, even after sorting neurons according to their preferred locations. The ANN thus implements a generalization of hand-wired attractor networks, in which the integration of velocity inputs by the recurrent weights occurs in a basis shuffled by an arbitrary linear transformation. Given these results, one cannot expect a connectomic reconstruction of a recurrent circuit to display an ordered matrix structure even when the dynamics are low-dimensional, without considering the output projection. Because trials in the mouse experiments typically ended almost immediately when the mouse had seen both landmarks (See Extended Data Fig. 1f for a quantification), we did not quantify the topology of the neural dynamics in RSC. (t) Low-dimensional state-space dynamics in the ANN with external map input suggests novel form of probabilistic encoding. Visualization of the full state-space dynamics of the hidden layer population, projected onto the three largest principal components, for constant-velocity trajectories. ANN hidden layer activity was low-dimensional: Fig. 3a shows data on low-dimensional dynamics, evident in maintained pairwise correlations, and Fig. 3d and panel p show correlation dimension. Trajectories are shown from the beginning of the trials; arrows indicate landmark encounter locations, black squares: first landmark encounter; black circles: second landmark encounter; line colors denote trajectory stage: LM0 (green), LM1 (blue), andLM2 (grey). Data in a-c is from 1000 trials from experiment configuration 3 (see Methods); sensory noise was set to zero. Trajectory starting points were selected to be a fixed distance before the first landmark. The intermediate ring (LM1) corresponds to times at which the output neurons represent multiple hypotheses, whereas the final location-coding ring (LM2), well-separated from the multiple hypothesis coding ring, corresponds to the period during which the output estimate has collapsed to a single hypothesis. In other words, the network internally encodes single-location hypothesis states separably from multi-location hypothesis states, as we find in RSC (Fig. 1), and transitions smoothly between them, a novel form of encoding of probability distributions that appears distinct from previously suggested forms of probabilistic representation39,62. (u) ANN trial trajectory examples, (corresponding to Fig. 2e). Divergence of trajectories for two paths that are idiothetically identical until after the second landmark encounter. ‘a' and ‘b' denote identities of locally ambiguous identical landmarks. Disambiguation occurs at the second landmark encounter, or by encountering locations where a landmark would be expected in the opposite identity assignments. See insets for geometry of trajectories and landmark locations. LM2 state has been simplified in these plots. (v) All four trajectories from panel b plotted simultaneously, and with full corresponding LM2 state. (w) The low-dimensional state-space manifold is stable, attracting perturbed states back to it, which suggests that the network dynamics follow a low-dimensional continuous attractor and the network's computations are robust to most types of noise. Relaxations in state space after perturbations before the first (left), between first and second (middle), and after the second (right) landmark encounter. For the base trial, a trial with two landmarks and random trajectory was chosen. The first and second landmark encounter in this base trial is at time t = 2 s and t = 4.6 s respectively. At time t = 1 s (left), t = 4 s (middle), and t = 7 s (right) a multiplicative perturbation of size 50% was introduced at the hidden layer. See Extended Data Fig. 10l for same result on internal map ANNs.

(a) Top: Tuning curves (mean rate) for displacement from last encountered landmark for LM1 and LM2 states in ANN. Bottom: Same data, but distribution of firing rates. The network discovers that displacement from the last landmark encounter in the LM1 period is a key latent variable, and its encoding is an emergent property. Intriguingly, a similar displacement-to-location coding switch has been observed in mouse CA167, suggesting that the empirically observed switch may be related to the brain performing spatial reasoning to disambiguate between multiple location hypotheses. (b) Same as panel a but for global location, ANN neurons became more tuned to global location rather than landmark-relative information after encountering the 2nd landmark. (c) Decoding of location, displacement, and separation between landmarks from the ANN in a 2-landmark environment by a linear decoder that remains fixed across trials and environments. Top: Squared population decoding error of location (green) and displacement (blue), as a function of the number of encountered landmarks. As suggested by the well-tuned activity of ANN neurons, location can be linearly decoded in the LM2 state. Displacement can be best decoded in the LM1 state. Bottom: Square decoding error of distance between landmarks, as a function of the number of encountered landmarks. The representation is particularly accurate around the time just before and after the first landmark encounter, when location disambiguation takes place. Top: Performance was evaluated on 1000 trials from experiment configuration 2. For location, the decoder corresponded to the network location estimate. For displacement, the linear decoder was trained on 4000 separate trials. Bottom: experiment configuration 1 with 4000 trials to train the linear decoder and 1000 trials to evaluate it. Thus, the network's encoding of these three critical variables is dynamic and tied to the different computational imperatives at each stage: displacement and landmark separation are not explicit inputs but the network estimates these and represents them in a decodable way at LM1, the critical time when this information is essential to the computation. After LM2, the network decodability of landmark separation drops, as it is no longer essential. (d) Neurons in RSC also became less well tuned to relative displacements from landmarks in LM2 relative to LM1: histogram across all RSC neurons of entropy of tuning curve for angular displacement from last seen landmark in RSC. Black: for LM2 state, Blue: for LM1 state. Red: histogram of pairwise differences. For this analysis, angular firing rate distributions were analyzed relative to either the global reference frame or the last seen landmark. (e) Same as d, but for global location. (f) The absolute change in landmark-relative displacement coding (d) is larger than that of the allocentric location tuning (e), suggesting that the latter is less affected by task state.

(a) Bottom: Mean spatial activity profile of 2 example ANN neurons for LM1 and LM2. Average tuning is higher for the LM2 state. Top: same data as histograms, showing that the less well-tuned LM1 state corresponds to a bimodal rate distribution (rates are high in some trials, low in others) that transitions to a unimodal distribution once the 2nd landmark has been identified in LM2. Data are from experiment configuration 2 (See Methods, section ‘Overview over experiment configurations used with ANNs'). Tuning curves were calculated using 20 bins of location/displacements and normalized individually for each neuron. The first time step in each trial and time steps with non-zero landmark input were excluded from the analysis. For histograms, each condition was binned in 100 column bins and neuron rates in 10 row bins. Histograms were normalized to equal sum per column. (b) Similarly, RSC rates are more dispersed per location in LM1. Schematic of analysis: firing rates were low pass filtered at 0.5 Hz, and for each location, the distribution of rates was computed in 8 bins, between the lowest and highest rate of that cell. (c) Example analysis for one cell. Top: Rate distribution resolved by 2D-location (4×4 bins) for example RSC neuron. Bottom: the resulting 16 histograms for LM1 and LM2 each, red dotted example histograms correspond to indicated example location (red dotted circles). (d) Summary statistics showing a more dispersed rate distribution per location in LM1. In sum, this analysis shows that in addition to the explicit encoding of uncertainty by a stable rate code (conjunctive with position and other variables), as shown in Fig. 1d,e,f and Extended Data Fig. 2a, where one would not expect a higher degree of trial-to-trial variability with higher uncertainty, there is still a degree of increased variability in states where the mouse might ‘take a guess' that would differ between trials. This parallels a similar behavior in the ANN (panel a).

(a) Low-dimensional population structure can be probed by pairwise neural relationships30: correlations or offsets in spatial tuning between cell pairs should be preserved across environments if the dynamics across environments is low-dimensional. Example spike rates (6 sec window, low-passed at 1 Hz using a single-pole Butterworth filter) for 3 RSC neuron pairs from one example session. R values for each pair were computed across the LM1 and LM2 condition, as well as in the task-initialization phase where mice had to hunt blinking dots (Extended Data Figs. 1, 4). The latter provides a control condition where no landmark-based navigation was required and mice instead had to walk to randomly appearing targets. (b) Top: pairwise correlation matrices for LM1,2 and dot-hunting conditions. Example pairs are highlighted (i,ii,iii). Bottom: spatial firing rate profiles for example pairs. Same analysis as in Fig. 3a. (c) RSC activity is globally low-dimensional. Proportion of variance of low-pass filtered (0.5 Hz) firing rates explained by first 45 principal components from the LM1 states. Proportion of variance explained (black, 16 sessions) drops to below that of shuffled spike trains (red) after the 6-10th principal component. The inset shows the analysis split by condition (same as in panels a and b), and 95% Cis for the spectra across sessions. The right panel shows zoomed in region of the same plot. We found no relationship between individual PCA components and task variables. (d) Correlation dimension in RSC is also low (same analysis as for the ANN in Extended Data Fig. 5p). This measure typically overestimates manifold dimension66, and thus serves as an upper bound on the true manifold dimension. (e) Grey/black: Summary statistics (median and quartiles) for correlation of correlations (panel b shows one example session, black dots indicate individual sessions, N = 16). Median of R value of R values for LM1 vs. LM2 = 0.74 (corresponding R in ANN = 0.73), for LM1 vs. dot-hunting = 0.51. Green: same analysis but spike rates were computed with a 5 Hz low-pass instead of the 1 Hz used throughout, no systematic changes were observed as function of low-pass settings. (f) Rates of individual RSC neurons can be predicted from other neurons with linear regression. In the LM2 to LM2 condition (black), the linear fit is computed for one held-out neuron's rate from other concurrent rates, and the same regression weights are then used to predict rates during LM1 (green) and dot-hunting (red) time periods. True rates of predicted neurons are plotted as solid black lines. (g) Summary statistics for the linear regression. Histograms show the proportion of explained variance for all 984 neurons, split by condition. In the LM2 to LM2 condition, the fit is computed from other concurrent rates (40.5% variance explained, median across neurons). In the two other conditions, the regression weights are fit in LM2 and held fixed. The sequential, non-interleaved nature of this train/test split across task phases means that any consistent firing rate drifts across the conditions will lead to poor predictions, and consequently, a small number of neurons exhibit negative R2 values indicating a fit that can, for some cells, be worse than an average rate model (11.3% for LM1, 19.3% median across neurons for dot-hunting, small grey bars). However, 24.3% of variance (median across neurons) can be explained despite significant changes in spatial receptive fields (predict LM1 with LM2 weights) and even for a different task, with 16.2% when predicting dot-hunting activity from LM2 weights (red and green histogram and bars showing 95% CI of median). (h) Pairwise correlations between RSC neurons in another example session, same analysis as in panel b, and associated scatterplots. (i) Low-dimensional activity quantified via participation ratio (PR)68. This analysis does not account for noisy eigenvalue estimates from spiketrains, and consequently the shuffled spike trains where there are no prominent modes that correspond to stable sensory, motor, or latent states, yield values of PR = ~ 45.

(a) Top left: the speed at which the neural activity evolves (avg. speed of largest 5 principal components, filtered at 1 Hz, CIs via bootstrap) correlates with running speed. Top right: When landmarks appear/disappear, they perturb neural activity (effect of mouse speed is regressed out). Bottom: Analysis of the time course of the prediction of LM0,1,2 state from RSC firing rates around the time when the landmarks appeared. Plots show 95% CIs for the mean of the state prediction, aligned to the mean, corresponding to a de-biased state estimation probability over time. Decoding was performed using the same method as in Fig. 1. (b) For some analyses of the low-dimensional dynamics in RSC (Fig. 4, this figure panel h), rate fluctuations related to non-spatial covariates such as speed, heading, etc. were removed: a single-layer LSTM with 20 hidden units was trained to predict the mouse position in a 10×10 grid from the RSC rates. The network learned 20 spatially relevant mixtures of input firing rates, with appropriate temporal smoothing to represent the mouse location. These activations were then embedded into 3-D space via isomap53. (c) To find trials across which mouse trajectories as they approached the 2nd landmark were similar, mouse trajectories were clustered (see Methods) leading to a subset of trials with similar locomotion and visual inputs. (d) The activity of RSC, in the low-dimensional representation, and in raw spike counts was then analyzed further. The example plot shows low-dimensional neural trajectories from LM0,1,2 states during matched mouse trajectories. (e) Alternative hypotheses for smoothness / predictability of neural dynamics across trials (corresponding to Fig. 4c). Dynamics across trials could behave like a laminar flow, so that trials with similar neural state remain so (top), or they could shuffle, leading to a loss of the pairwise distance relationships across trials (bottom). (f) We measured this maintenance vs. loss of correlation in a sliding 750 ms window beginning at the 2nd landmark onset, versus a window just before. CIs were computed across sessions (See Methods). (g) Hypotheses for whether stable neural dynamics (Fig. 3b,c, Extended Data Fig. 8) can determine how RSC activity encodes disambiguated landmark identity (‘a' or ‘b'). Top: trials in which the correct identity is ‘a' but that are neurally close to other trials where the answer is ‘b' might get dragged along in the wrong direction at least transiently. This would indicate relevance of recurrent dynamics on this computation. Bottom: alternatively, neural activity could be determined by the correct answer, even in trials that (in neural rate space) are close to trials from the opposing class. (h) We tested this by finding the closest trial from the opposing class (for example the closest LM1a for a LM1b trial) in the 3-D embedded (via Isomap) RSC rate space. To evaluate co-evolution regardless of this selection confound, we then analyzed the direction of flow of the neural state over time (red). As a control, we also analyzed neurally far trials (grey). The flow direction of the neural activity was significantly aligned for ~100 ms. Median and CI via bootstrap. (i) Left: Schematic for the analysis of representation of LM1a vs. LM1b states. Trial-to-trial distances were compared within group vs. across group. Right: Both before and after the 2nd landmark becomes visible, the classes are distinct in neural state space. (Same data as in Fig. 4b, 5 sessions, 101 matched trials). (j) Whether a trial comes from LM1a or b can also be decoded from low-pass filtered (2 Hz) firing rates before the 2nd landmark onset (via regression tree, cross-validated across trials, balanced N across conditions, 5 sessions).

(a) ANN with binary landmark presence input. Here, the ANN must simultaneously infer the landmark locations and the location of the animal, in contrast to the previous “external map” configuration. These determinations are inter-related, thus the much higher difficulty of the task. Structure of the recurrent network. Input neurons encoded noisy velocity (10 neurons) and landmark information (1 neuron). In the internal map setup, the input signaled whether a landmark was present at the current position or not. (b) State space trajectories in the internal map network after the second landmark encounter in two different environments. The dark green / dark blue parts of the trajectories correspond to the sections before the third landmark encounter. Left: Predominantly counterclockwise trajectories, right: Predominantly clockwise trajectories. Landmarks and trajectories were sampled with the same parameters as experiment configuration 1, but the duration of test trials was extended from 10 s (100 timesteps) to 50 s (500 timesteps). Only trials with low error after the second landmark encounter are shown, defined as maximum network localization error smaller than 0.5 rad, measured in a time window between 5 timesteps after the second landmark encounter until the end of the trial. Only the state-space trajectory after the second landmark encounter is displayed. (c) State space dimension is approximately 3, same analysis as in Extended Data Fig. 5p. (d) Example tuning curves, same analysis as in Extended Data Fig. 5m. (e) Linear decoding of position, displacement from last landmark and landmark separation from ANN activity, same analysis as in Extended Data Fig. 6c. A multinomial regression decoder was trained on 4000 trials from experiment configuration 1 (the training distribution of the internal map task) to predict from hidden layer activities which of the four possible environments was present. Performance was evaluated on separate 1000 test trials sampled from the training distribution. (f) Example neurons showing transition from egocentric landmark-relative displacement coding to allocentric location encoding, same analysis as in Extended Data Fig. 6a,b. (g) Example neurons showing conjunctive encoding, same analysis as in Extended Data Fig. 2b. Location tuning curves were determined after the second landmark encounter using 1000 trials from experiment configuration 2 using 20 location bins. Velocity and uncertainty from the posterior circular variance of the enhanced particle filter were binned in three equal bins. (h) Distribution of absolute connection strength between and across location-sensitive “place cells” (PCs) and location-insensitive “unselective cells” (UCs), same analysis as in Extended Data Fig. 5n. (i) Hidden unit activations, corresponding to Fig. 2d. (j) Trajectories from example trials, as in Fig. 2e. (k) Same trajectories as in i&j but with full LM2 state. (l) ANN is robust to perturbations, same as in Extended Data Fig. 5w. (m) ANN maintains pairwise correlation structure across states and environments, same as in Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 5o. (n) ANN with non-negative rates recapitulates the main findings from the conventional ANNs. Training an ANN in the external map condition but with non-negative activity replicated all key results from the other NN types: we observed similar results with respect to location and displacement tuning (r), the transition in linear decodability of displacement to location from the population and dynamically varying decodability of landmark separations within trials (p), the presence of heterogeneous and conjunctive tuning (s), lack of modularity in connectivity between cells with high and low amounts of spatial selectivity (t), and the preservation of cell-to-cell correlations across time within trials and across environments (q). The nonlinearity does affect the distribution of recurrent weights: The distribution of non-diagonal elements in the non-negative network is sparse (excess kurtosis k = 7.8), while it is close to Gaussian for the external and internal map networks with tanh-nonlinearity (k = 0.6 and k = 0.9 respectively; panel u); however, the distributions of eigenvalues of the recurrent weights have similar characteristics for all trained networks (panel v). Structure of the recurrent network: Input neurons encoded noisy velocity (10 neurons) and received external map input (70 neuron), same as the regular external map ANN. Recurrent layer rates were constrained to be non-negative. (o) Example tuning curves, same analysis as before. (p)Linear decoding of position, displacement from last landmark and landmark separation from ANN activity, same analysis as before. (q) ANN maintains pairwise correlation structure across states and environments, same as before. (r) Example neurons showing transition from egocentric landmark-relative displacement coding to allocentric location encoding, same analysis as before. (s) Example neurons showing conjunctive encoding, same analysis before. (t) Distribution of absolute connection strength between and across location-sensitive “place cells” (PCs) and location-insensitive “unselective cells” (UCs), same analysis as before. (u) Distribution of non-diagonal recurrent weights for randomly initialized (untrained), external map, internal map, and non-negative network. The k-value measured denotes excess kurtosis, a measure of deviation from Gaussianity (k = 0 for Gaussian distributions). The presence of a nonlinearity constraint on the ANN affects the distribution of recurrent weights: The distribution of non-diagonal elements in the non-negative network is sparse (excess kurtosis k = 7.8), while it is close to Gaussian for the external and internal map networks with tanh-nonlinearity (k = 0.6 and k = 0.9 respectively). (v) Scatterplot of real and imaginary part of complex eigenvalues of recurrent weight matrix for randomly initialized (untrained), external map, internal map, and non-negative network. The distributions of eigenvalues of the recurrent weights have similar characteristics for all trained networks.

Metrics details

Biomolecular condensates in cells compartmentalize vital processes by enriching molecules through molecular recognition. However, it remains elusive how transport occurs in biomolecular condensates and how it relates to their dynamic and/or viscoelastic state. We show that the transport of molecules in DNA model condensates does not follow classical Fickian diffusion, which has a blurry front with a square root of time dependence. By contrast, we identify a new type of transport with an ultrasharp front that propagates linearly with time. Our data reveal that this ultrasharp ballistic diffusion front originates from molecular recognition and an arrested-to-dynamic transition in the condensate properties. This diffusion mechanism is the result of intertwining chemical kinetics and condensate dynamics on transport in biomolecular condensates. We believe that our understanding will help to better explain and tune the dynamics and properties in synthetic condensate systems and for biological functions.

Biomolecular condensates formed by the liquid–liquid phase separation of nucleic acids1,2 and proteins3,4 in cells serve as signalling and reaction hubs5,6, and gate accessibility, for instance, to the nucleus7. The transfer of concepts from polymer science has greatly advanced the understanding of condensate formation, stabilization and their physicochemical properties8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16.

Despite this progress, a mechanistic understanding of how macromolecules are transported into and within condensates remains limited. Biomolecular condensates possess complex viscoelastic properties and are typically classified as liquid like or solid like17,18,19. However, the functional relevance of the solid-like state beyond regulating the mechanical properties and arresting dynamics is poorly understood5,20. In a wider content, in the crowded and heterogeneous environment of cells and condensates with complex viscoelastic properties21,22,23,24, transport may deviate from classical diffusion and be influenced by complex relaxation dynamics25 or specific interactions26,27, leading to an anomalous diffusion behaviour7,28. To dissect these intricacies, minimalistic synthetic model systems offer powerful platforms to study the behaviour in well-controlled settings29,30.

In this study, we report on the observation of a new diffusion behaviour during the uptake of macromolecules into biomolecular condensates driven by molecular recognition. Our findings reveal this unprecedented diffusion mechanism on the addition of a short oligonucleotide, termed ‘invader', to DNA condensates composed of long single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The invader selectively binds to complementary domains in the DNA condensate. During its uptake, a sharp diffusion front is formed with an accumulation of a high concentration of the invader at this front, which propagates with a linear time dependence. This contradicts the commonly observed fuzzy concentration gradients and nonlinear propagation kinetics described by Fickian diffusion, which widely applies to many diffusion processes in solutions. We quantify, model and extrapolate the multiscale non-equilibrium nature of this new diffusion mode and distinguish it from the current understanding of diffusion and transport in condensates. We discuss the generalization of the findings based on the physicochemical interplay between condensate dynamics, molecular recognition and chemical kinetics.

We prepared DNA condensates by the temperature-induced coacervation of two long ssDNA copolymers, p(A20-m)n and p(T20-k)n in a TE buffer at 50 mM of MgCl2 (n, repeating units; Extended Data Fig. 1)31,32,33. A20 and T20 are homorepeats of adenine- and thymine-containing nucleotides, respectively, whereas m and k are DNA barcode sequences that can bind complementary oligonucleotides (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Briefly, on heating a p(A20-m)n/p(T20-k)n mixture, p(A20-m)n undergoes selective temperature-induced liquid–liquid phase separation and forms spherical condensates above its cloud point temperature (~42 °C)31, whereas p(T20-k)n remains in solution. During cooling, p(T20-k)n localizes at the periphery of p(A20-m)n condensates by A20/T20 hybridization and forms a thin and permeable shell (Extended Data Fig. 1c)32,33. This process results in micrometre-sized core–shell condensates with addressable barcodes in the core (m) and shell (k). The shells are typically labelled at the k barcodes with fluorescent ssDNA (k*-dye) for visualization (Extended Data Fig. 1d)31,32. The m barcodes in the core provide recognition sites for the diffusing molecules (invaders, m*) and mimic molecular recognition in biological systems.

Surprisingly, the uptake of invaders (m*-Atto488), which specifically bind to the m barcodes inside the condensate, results in a sharp, high-intensity diffusion front (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Video 1). The front propagates linearly with time, that is, ΔX (front displacement) ∝ t (time) (Fig. 1c,d). This represents a ballistic behaviour (constant velocity) of the macroscopic diffusion front. Considerable swelling occurs in the invaded region to a final swelling ratio of about fourfold in volume (Fig. 1b,e). The high-intensity front arises from the spatial accumulation of the invaders and is stable in shape during propagation (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 2). This propagating steady state indicates the balanced kinetic processes of invader binding and condensate swelling at the front interface. This behaviour is fundamentally different from classical Fickian diffusion, which exhibits unavoidable concentration gradients and a power-law relationship of the front propagation with time, that is, ΔX ∝ t1/2 (Fig. 1a).

The sharp diffusion front is a non-equilibrium steady-state interface, where DNA chain extension occurs because m barcodes of the p(A20-m)n ssDNA are converted to m/m* double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) segments. Molecular dynamics simulations using oxDNA yield a 64% increase in the radius of gyration from p(A20-m)n to p(A20-m/m*)n (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Methods 1)34,35,36. An acceleration of the front propagation is visible in the final invasion stage, probably caused by the interference of individual diffusion fronts and the smaller surface area once the fronts start to share the same non-invaded centre. The process loosely resembles ‘case II diffusion'37,38 that describes the diffusion of solvents with sharp fronts into specific thermoplastics. However, despite a phenomenological similarity, case II diffusion in thermoplastics cannot account for a high-intensity front; critically, the origin and underlying physical principles are profoundly different. Condensates, unlike thermoplastics, are solvent-rich entities, and we elucidate that molecular recognition plays a key role—a specific property inherent to biomacromolecules and responsible for condensate formation in cells. We term this new molecular-recognition-enabled frontal diffusion mechanism with a high-intensity invader front as ‘ballistic wave diffusion', which satisfies the condition of ΔX ∝ t.

To gain mechanistic insights, we synthesized fluorescent p(A20-mdye)n to study the dynamic properties of p(A20-mdye)n chains in the condensate before and after invasion. During invasion with m*-Atto488, the dilution of the p(A20-mAtto594)n condensate in the outer region is now evident (Fig. 2a,b, magenta channel). The approximate fourfold swelling causes a fourfold drop in the intensity of the core material p(A20-mAtto594)n. The invader front localizes precisely at the boundary from the compact non-invaded to the swollen invaded condensate (Fig. 2c). We correlate the relative changes in the dynamic properties of the DNA condensates before and after invasion using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM)39, which provide complementary insights into the mesoscale diffusion behaviour and nanoscale chain flexibility. FRAP shows drastic differences in recovery kinetics before and after invasion. Before invasion, the condensates are in an arrested state in which the bleached region does not recover even after 6,000 s (Fig. 2d–f). By contrast, after invasion, the condensates become dynamic with fluorescence recovery (Fig. 2e,f). Quantification using the reciprocal of the half-recovery time (1/t1/2) reveals differences of at least two orders of magnitude (Fig. 2g). FLIM and lifetime analyses show a significant increase from a lifetime of about 2.9 ns in the arrested/non-invaded region to about 3.4 ns in the dynamic/invaded region. The phasor plot shows two different distributions (Fig. 2h–j)40,41.

Since our condensates are based on semidilute and entangled ssDNA polymer solutions that are viscoelastic, we used force spectroscopy via colloidal probe atomic force microscopy (AFM)42 to study differences in mechanical properties for the condensates before and after invasion (Fig. 2k,l and Supplementary Fig. 1). The force response during indentation increases more drastically for condensates before invasion, whereas after invasion, the condensates are significantly softer. This is a direct comparative measure for the elastic response. Additionally, a larger hysteresis is visible between the compression and retraction curves for condensates after invasion (Fig. 2m and Supplementary Fig. 1). Since hysteresis is a measure of energy dissipation, this indicates increasingly liquid-like properties for condensates after invasion. By contrast, the near-superimposing compression/retraction curves of the condensate before invasion are closer to an elastic material with little energy dissipation. These insights provide direct evidence for distinct mechanical properties of the two types of condensate, as regulated by ballistic wave diffusion.

On the basis of these data, the following picture emerges. The initial DNA condensates are in an arrested state, similar to some aged condensates in biology literature5,17,19,20,43. This arrested state is due to the efficient arrest of p(A20-m)n with divalent Mg2+ ions44. During invasion, m/m* hybridization occurs by molecular recognition, and invasion is restricted to the frontier zone. The high intensity of the front is due to the initial high concentration of m barcodes in the compact condensate. The m/m* binding causes swelling, dilution of p(A20-m/m*)n, and simultaneous liquefaction in this volume. The relaxation from the compact high-concentration front to the swollen and dynamic final state is a time-dependent process due to the polymeric nature of the condensate. The swelling is induced by chain stiffening and expansion due to partial dsDNA formation in partly hybridized p(A20-m/m*)n, a solubilizing effect of m* binding, and a minor increase in osmotic pressure. Simulations in Extended Data Fig. 3 confirm the expansion, and further control experiments support this physical picture. (1) A non-binding ssDNA diffuses about two orders of magnitude faster in dynamic/invaded condensates than in arrested/non-invaded condensates (Extended Data Fig. 4). The diffusion of small ssDNA is strongly suppressed in the arrested/non-invaded condensates. The measured diffusion coefficients are in line with those found in other condensates45,46. (2) Invasion with a non-charged peptide nucleic acid (PNA) strand (m*PNA-Atto488) results in substantially less swelling, and the condensates remain in an arrested state after invasion (Extended Data Fig. 5a–e). (3) Hybridization of p(A20-m)n with DNA m* increases the solubility of p(A20-m)n, whereas PNA-m* has an intermediate effect (Extended Data Fig. 5f–h). Points (2) and (3) confirm that the negative charges of the DNA invader contribute to the swelling and regulation of the arrested-to-dynamic transition of the invaded condensates.

To rationalize and predict the behaviour of ballistic wave diffusion, we built a model using reaction–diffusion equations (Extended Data Fig. 6a and Supplementary Methods 2). The model includes different diffusivities of the invader (m*) in the arrested/non-invaded (D0) and dynamic/invaded part (D1), the binding reaction of m/m* (kbind) and the subsequent swelling (kswell). The swelling is associated with a swelling factor (fswell). Since we know that volumetric swelling is about fourfold and the m barcode concentration ([m]) inside the condensates is about 1 mM (Supplementary Fig. 2), we can assign realistic starting points to these simulations (Supplementary Table 1).

Let us hypothesize a ballistic wave diffusion process. When m* diffuses into the condensate, it binds to an unoccupied m and forms a compact p(A20-m/m*)n that is part of the arrested interior (m/m* = Marrested). After binding, solubilization of the local segment occurs, leading to swelling and a transition from Marrested to Mswollen. Binding can be considered diffusion-controlled and unbinding can be neglected because of the high binding strength of m/m* (melting temperature, Tm ≈ 71.5 °C; Supplementary Methods 3). Once swelling has occurred, that is, [Mswollen] exceeds a threshold, D0 for m* in this volume element increases to D1 (D1 ≫ D0). Therefore, subsequent m* can diffuse rapidly through the swollen region, but is drastically slowed down at the transition to the arrested region (Fig. 3a).

This model can successfully reproduce ballistic wave diffusion with ballistic propagation kinetics (ΔX ∝ t) and a sharp and stably propagating diffusion front of high intensity with a locally high m/m* concentration (Fig. 3b). It can also extrapolate behaviour. For instance, when the swelling process is accelerated (kswell increases) but the difference between two diffusion coefficients is maintained, the high-intensity front (that is, the wave) disappears, but the front remains sharp and still propagates linearly with time (Fig. 3c). We term such a state as ‘ballistic front diffusion'. When the diffusion coefficient for m* is assumed to be the same inside the arrested/non-invaded and dynamic/invaded parts of the condensate, the transport follows Fickian diffusion with a blurry front and a front displacement proportional to t1/2 (Fig. 3d). A full phase diagram with varied D0 and D1 shows that the appearance of the ballistic front and wave diffusion originates from the difference between D0 and D1 (Extended Data Fig. 6b and Supplementary Discussion 1). Additional orienting simulations in two and three dimensions are in line with the one-dimensional simulations and show a slight acceleration at late stages, as observed in experiments (Fig. 1c,d, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Methods 4).

Simulations suggest that the sharpness and height of the front (Ip/I0) should decrease with enhanced swelling kinetics (Fig. 4a,b). At the molecular level, swelling kinetics depend on the length of the p(A20-m)n chains because swelling occurs through relaxation, reptation and disentanglement of the polymer chains47. Indeed, we find a less-pronounced high-intensity wave for shorter p(A20-m)n (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 7).

Moreover, the simulations predict a transition from ballistic wave diffusion to ballistic front diffusion and even to classical Fickian diffusion for condensates with increasing swelling kinetics and when the differences in D1 and D0 of m* are reduced (Fig. 3b–d). This can be experimentally achieved by decreasing the ionic strength. Lower [Mg2+] increases the net charge density of the phosphodiester backbone of p(A20-m)n (refs. 48,49). In addition to increasing the persistence length of p(A20-m)n, the chain-bridging effect of Mg2+ is also reduced44. This is reflected in a Mg2+-dependent swelling of DNA condensates (Fig. 4e). A gradual decrease in [Mg2+] from 50 mM to 15 mM leads to a change in the invasion process from ballistic wave diffusion to ballistic front diffusion and finally to Fickian diffusion (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Video 3). FRAP experiments on non-invaded and invaded DNA condensates allow the quantification of internal dynamics (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 8). For [Mg2+] ≥ 20 mM, the condensates are arrested before invasion and show a dynamic character only after invasion. At this point, the swelling due to lower [Mg2+] before invasion does not yet overcompensate for the interaction between the p(A20-m)n chains. Further decrease in [Mg2+] yields a discontinuous and drastic property change. At the transition point to Fickian behaviour ([Mg2+] = 17.5 mM), the DNA condensates already exhibit a comparatively dynamic interior that still increases by one order of magnitude after invasion. Lower [Mg2+] (15 mM) then shows similar dynamics before and after invasion. This clearly underscores two points. First, the observation of sharp diffusion fronts requires a distinct transition from an arrested to a dynamic condensate during invasion. Second, the transition between the two regimes (and thus the appearance of a high-intensity wave) depends on preinvasion swelling, because this eliminates the need for a swelling process after the invader binds to its barcode.

Broadband coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (BCARS) provides additional information on the chain conformation of p(A20-m)n. Lower [Mg2+] leads to a marked decrease in Raman intensity for specific peaks in the range of 1,300–1,600 cm–1 (Fig. 4g), characteristic of nucleobases50. This phenomenon, called Raman hypochromism, suggests that the p(A20-m)n chains in the condensates adopt a more compact coil conformation with less base stacking due to geometric confinement at high [Mg2+]. By contrast, lower [Mg2+] leads to a more extended, relaxed conformation due to an increase in the effective charges along the backbone, resulting in the swelling of the condensates and a gain in free volume and dynamics, which facilitates the base stacking interactions known for adenine in ssDNA51,52,53. Using a fluorescent reporter for Mg2+, we find a slightly higher Mg2+ concentration inside the condensates than the solution before invasion, whereas such differences vanish after the invasion process. This arises from the lower negative charge density inside the condensates after invader-induced swelling (Supplementary Fig. 4).

Finally, we ask how well the model can capture and predict the tunability of the frontal velocity and the width of the high-intensity diffusion front. Our approach targets establishing generic scaling laws rather than a perfect fit that would require accurate assumptions for unknown kinetic parameters. Simulations predict a power-law dependence of the front velocity (vsim) on the concentration of the invader (vsim ∝ [m*]0.5; Fig. 4j and Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). This dependence is reflected in experiments (Fig. 4i,j). A similar good agreement is found for the dependence of the front velocity (v) with front width (W), which follows a linear correlation (v ∝ W; Fig. 4h,k,l and Extended Data Fig. 6e). The agreement between the model and experiment provides a clear physical picture of the dynamization and relaxation processes at the diffusion front. Higher [m*] can penetrate deeper into the arrested region at the steady-state diffusion front, resulting in a wider front interface and transition region. Accordingly, more compact p(A20-m)n chains bind m* in a given volume and time element, leading to faster relaxation in a larger volume element and, consequently, to a faster transition from compact p(A20-m)n to swollen p(A20-m/m*)n.

We have identified a new diffusion mechanism—ballistic wave diffusion—in soft matter in general and in biomolecular condensates in particular. Unlike Fickian diffusion, ballistic wave diffusion is characterized by an ultrasharp diffusion front that propagates with ballistic properties, that is, linearly with time. The invading molecules accumulate in a non-equilibrium high-intensity front, representing a transition interface that relaxes with time. Molecular recognition and a transition from arrested to dynamic and swollen condensates during the invasion of a binding macromolecule are critical elements for ballistic wave diffusion. This diffusion mechanism could not have been previously identified in classical polymer coacervates, because the molecular recognition event between the invader and its ‘receptor' plays a key role in the non-equilibrium process. To verify the general relevance of ballistic wave diffusion, we also investigate the invasion of m* into a membraneless sticker–spacer DNA condensate formed by p(A20-m-XL)n, as internally stabilized by palindromic XL domains. Indeed, ballistic wave diffusion also manifests there (Extended Data Fig. 9). This is an important generalization as such membraneless sticker–spacer condensates are generic models for membraneless organelles formed by RNA or proteins in biology15,54,55. In future, it will be relevant to understand how domain variations, such as extending or reducing the adenine repeats, and modulating thermodynamic binding interactions, by introducing mismatches in the invader sequence or changing its length, influence the diffusion behaviour.

Although we show ballistic wave diffusion in purely synthetic DNA model condensates, molecular recognition (for example, based on protein/RNA binding or coiled-coil interactions) and different dynamic states are ubiquitous in biological coacervates2,15,17,20,24,28. Interestingly, sharp diffusion fronts can be found in biology literature, for example, for condensates based on coiled-coil interactions28, but without noticing its importance or physical origin. In particular, our study explains these observations with non-Fickian diffusion concepts, bridging the gap between polymer physics and cellular processes. Although the implications of this observation for biological function and its generalization remain to be elucidated, the importance of ballistic wave diffusion lies in its ability to generate sharper signal fronts with clearer spatial concentration thresholds compared with traditional Fickian diffusion. Moreover, the ballistic wave diffusion mechanism highlights how invading molecules can—in real time—modify the dynamic properties in condensates. This has important implications for the spatial and temporal sequestration of molecules within cellular condensates and for controlling transport processes at membranes, such as the nuclear pore complex7. Besides, it suggests an additional role of condensate dynamics with respect to signal selection and rejection, and for how biology might adaptively regulate these processes through environmental triggers that alter the condensate dynamics. As a proof of concept, we encapsulate a ribonuclease56 inside our condensates and find that the arrested condensates before invasion reject the substrate from diffusing into the condensate, and the reaction only occurs at the condensate surface. By contrast, dynamic condensates after invasion enable reactions in the entire interior (Extended Data Fig. 10). This demonstrates a functional gating effect related to the condensate dynamics as regulated by ballistic wave diffusion.

Our study suggests that ballistic wave diffusion can be a potentially important pathway for cells to regulate the dynamics of condensates and prevent them from aging and aggregation, which guarantees their normal functions during cellular processes. This could potentially guide therapeutic solutions for neurodegenerative diseases, which typically involve the liquid–solid transition of relevant biomolecular condensates formed by various proteins and nucleic acids, such as hnRNPA1, TDP-43 and FUS19,57,58,59. One may speculate that because fibre formation was observed to occur at the surface of such condensates60, their frontal suppression could provide an effective therapeutic intervention. We anticipate that our study provides a new perspective to comprehend the intricate interplay of dynamics and chemical kinetics in biomolecular condensates and their relation to cellular function.

The syntheses of the circular DNA template and its corresponding ssDNA polymer are adapted from our previous report with slight modifications (Extended Data Fig. 1)31,33. The linear ssDNA template and the corresponding ligation strand were first mixed at a concentration of 1 μM in 100 μl of TE buffer containing 100 mM of NaCl. The solution was heated to 85 °C for 5 min before cooling to 25 °C at a cooling rate of 0.01 °C s–1 for complete hybridization. Afterwards, 20 μl of 10× ligase buffer (500 mM of Tris-HCl, 100 mM of MgCl2, 50 mM of dithiothreitol and 10 mM of ATP (Lucigen)), 70 μl of nuclease-free water and 10 μl of T4 DNA ligase (2 U μl–1 (Lucigen)) were introduced into the reaction mixture and gently mixed before leaving at room temperature for a 3-h reaction. The reaction mixture was then heated to 70 °C for 20 min to deactivate the enzyme. Then, 10 μl of exonuclease I (40 U μl–1 (Lucigen)) and 10 μl of exonuclease III (200 U μl–1 (Lucigen)) were added into the reaction mixture for further overnight reaction at 37 °C to fully remove the ligation strands and any non-circularized templates in solution. Afterwards, the reaction mixture was heated to 80 °C for 40 min to deactivate the enzymes. To obtain the final circular ssDNA templates, the reaction mixture was washed by adding 400 μl of TE buffer and filtrated using Amicon ultracentrifugal filters with a 10-kDa cut-off (Merck Millipore) three times. The concentrations of the collected circular ssDNA templates were measured by the DS-11 spectrophotometer (DeNovix), and the templates were stored in a TE buffer at –20 °C.

For the synthesis of the long ssDNA polymers, we used rolling circle amplification. Here 5 μl of a circular template (1 μM in a TE buffer) and 1 μl of an exonuclease-resistant primer (10 μM in TE buffer) were mixed with 76 μl of nuclease-free water, 10 μl of commercial 10× polymerase buffer (500 mM of Tris-HCl, 100 mM of (NH4)2SO4, 40 mM of dithiothreitol and 100 mM of MgCl2 (Lucigen)), 2 μl of Φ29 DNA polymerase (10 U μl–1 (Lucigen)), 20 μl of inorganic pyrophosphatase (0.1 U μl–1 (New England BioLabs)) and 5 μl of adjusted deoxyribose nucleoside 5′-triphosphate mix (100 mM, the mix contains pure dATP, dTTP, dCTP and dGTP solutions mixed in corresponding proportions of the exact composition of the desired ssDNA polymer repeating units (Jena Bioscience)). Note that for the synthesis of ssDNA polymers with in-chain fluorophores of Atto488 and Atto594, that is, p(A20-mAtto488)n, p(T20-kAtto488)n and p(A20-mAtto594)n, we replaced 2 mol% of the dTTP in the mix with either aminoallyl-dUTP-XX-ATTO-488 or aminoallyl-dUTP-XX-ATTO-594 for random insertion of the dye along the ssDNA chains during rolling circle amplification. The reaction mixture was kept at 30 °C for 50 h before thermal cleavage at 95 °C for 15 min to shorten the ultrahigh-molecular-weight ssDNA31. The final products were purified by rinsing with 400 µl of TE buffer and filtration in Amicon Ultracentrifugal filters (30-kDa cut-off; Merck Millipore) three times. The concentrations of the collected final ssDNA polymers were measured using the DS-11 spectrophotometer (DeNovix), and the DNA polymers (cleaved at 95 °C for 15 min) were stored in a TE buffer at –20 °C.

The preparation of the DNA condensates is adapted from our previous reports with modifications for the formation of larger DNA condensates (Extended Data Fig. 1)31,33. For core–shell condensates, p(A20-m)n (0.5556 g l–1) and p(T20-k)n (0.0694 g l–1) were mixed in a TE buffer without any salt at a final volume of 9 μl. The solution mixture was then heated at 95 °C for 15 min (in addition to the first thermal cleavage during the ssDNA synthesis mentioned above) for thermal cleavage to further reduce the chain length of the ssDNA polymers. Afterwards, 1 μl of TE buffer containing 500 mM of MgCl2 was introduced into the reaction mixture. The solution containing finally 0.5 g l–1 of p(A20-m)n and 0.0625 g l–1 of p(T20-k)n with 50 mM of MgCl2 were heated to 95 °C for 20 min and subsequently cooled down to room temperature at 3 °C s–1 (ref. 31). Finally, a 10-μl solution containing the core–shell DNA condensates was diluted five times by adding 40 μl of TE buffer containing various amounts of MgCl2 to adjust [Mg2+] from 15 mM to 50 mM. The obtained 50-μl DNA condensates solution (as diluted five times) has 0.1 g l–1 of p(A20-m)n and 0.0125 g l–1 of p(T20-k)n, corresponding to ~8 μM of m barcode and ~1 μM of k barcode, respectively, in the total solution. The solution was then stored in a fridge at 4 °C for 1 week for equilibration. Before usage, the condensate solutions were always slightly vortexed for redispersion. For the membraneless condensate formed by p(A20-m-XL)n, the same method was used, except p(T20-k)n was not added in the solution. All the heating ramps were performed in polymerase chain reaction tubes with negligible evaporation. All imaging was done by CLSM at room temperature after preparation.

The chain lengths of p(A20-m)n and p(T20-k)n for the DNA condensates were quantified by gel electrophoresis using 2 wt% agarose gel under 5 V cm–1 for 150 min in a TAE buffer containing 40 mM of Tris-HCl, 20 mM of acetic acid and 1 mM of EDTA (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Post-staining by SYBR Gold was applied. Quantification of chain length distribution and average chain lengths of p(A20-m)n and p(T20-k)n uses a previously reported method61,62.

Here 19 μl solution containing k*-Atto647 (0–0.5 μM), m*-Atto488 (1–5 μM) and the desired concentration of MgCl2 in a TE buffer was prepared and homogeneously mixed before the final addition of 1 μl of DNA condensate stock solution (diluted five times). The DNA condensates were, thus, diluted 100 times, equalling a content of 0.4 µM of m barcode in the solution. Then, 20 μl of the mixture was added into a 384-well plate with another 10–20 μl of hexadecane on top to prevent evaporation. Typically, DNA condensates with diameters of around 15 ± 2 μm were chosen for the observation and recording of the invasion process. The invasion process was followed by taking time-series CLSM images with identical settings. The displacement of the front was calculated in reference to the centre of the condensate. Due to the change in the centre plane of the DNA condensates along the z direction during invasion-induced swelling, the z-focused cross-sectional plane in the CLSM was always slightly adjusted before each image acquisition to record the diffusion in the same two-dimensional plane.

To determine the dynamic properties of the DNA condensates before and after invasion, we used the region of interest (ROI) bleaching method (Figs. 2d–g and 4f and Extended Data Fig. 8). DNA condensates composed of p(A20-mAtto594)n were first imaged with a low laser intensity five times (2 s per frame) as the prebleaching images, before bleaching three times in a small circular ROI with a diameter of 2 μm by 100% laser intensity in the 561-nm channel. Then, 150 frames of the post-bleaching images were recorded at a rate of 2 s per frame over 300 s. The intensities within the circular ROI (IROI) and intensities in a circular region of the same size away from the bleached region within the condensates (Iref) in the pre- and post-bleaching images were measured with ImageJ (v2.9.0; 64-bit) for performing double normalization in the bleached regions as

to quantify the recovery kinetics over time. Note that I(t0) represents the intensity measured in the first image before bleaching. The half-recovery times (t1/2) from individual experiments were extracted from their corresponding recovery kinetics.

Note that the FRAP protocol is different for the 6,000-s FRAP experiment for the confirmation of arrested state of non-invaded DNA condensates at 20-mM MgCl2 (Fig. 2f). For this experiment, the post-bleaching images were manually recorded every several minutes over 6,000 s. Before each image acquisition, the focal plane was tuned to the bleached plane of the condensates to make sure the same ROI was monitored, avoiding interference caused by the movement of DNA condensate over the long experimental time. Due to the absence of recovery in this FRAP experiment over 6,000 s, we take 6,000 s as t1/2 for all the arrested DNA condensates.

To determine lifetime changes in the in-chain fluorophores along the p(A20-m)n chain during ballistic wave diffusion, we used DNA condensates with p(A20-mAtto488)n chains. We used non-fluorescent m* as the invader to avoid unnecessary interference between dyes. The reaction mixture contained diluted DNA condensates (0.8 μM of m barcode) and 3 μM of m* in a TE buffer with 50 mM of MgCl2.

FLIM images were recorded (Fig. 2h–j) based on FALCON-modified time-correlated single-photon-counting method with a Leica Stellaris 8 FLIM module. The phasor plots were generated by transforming the lifetime determined at each pixel of the FLIM image into a two-dimensional map according to the following equations41:

where gi,j(ω) and si,j(ω) are the x and y coordinates of the phasor plot, respectively; n and ω are the harmonic frequency and angular frequency of excitation, respectively; and T is the repeat frequency of acquisition. Major distributions of phasors were identified by cursors in the phasor plot, and the corresponding lifetimes were assigned into the greyscale images in red and blue colours.

The diffusion coefficients of invader (m*) within the invaded and non-invaded condensates cannot be directly determined due to the specific binding interactions between m*/m. Thus, we used a non-binding dummy strand of 20 nt labelled by Cy5 (Cy5-20nt-dummy). To measure the diffusion coefficients of Cy5-20nt-dummy in DNA condensates before invasion, we prepared a solution containing 100-times-diluted p(A20-m)n DNA condensates and 10 μM of Cy5-20nt-dummy in a TE buffer with 50 mM of MgCl2. For the diffusion coefficients of Cy5-20nt-dummy in DNA condensates after invasion, we prepared a solution containing 100-times-diluted p(A20-m/m*)n condensates, (complete m* invasion was reached before the FRAP experiments; shell labelled with k*-Atto488) and 10 μM of Cy5-20nt-dummy in a TE buffer with 50 mM of MgCl2.

We used the point-bleaching method (Extended Data Fig. 4). Several prebleaching images were first recorded, before bleaching by a 638-nm laser with 100% intensity at a single pixel for 3 s. Then, the post-bleaching images were recorded with the maximum frame rates over 1 min. Cross-sectional line profiles crossing the bleached centre in the post-bleaching images were taken over time, giving Gaussian distributions of the fluorescence intensity. Fitting the line profiles with a Gaussian function yielded a squared standard deviation (s.d.) of Gaussian distribution σ2, which changed over time. The diffusion coefficients (D) were then extracted by plotting σ2 over time with the slope being 2D (ref. 63).

The diffusion of PNA invaders (m*PNA-Atto488) was investigated by diluting 1 μl of the stock solution of non-fluorescent DNA condensates (diluted five times, in 50 mM of MgCl2) in 20 μl of solution containing 5 μM of m*PNA-Atto488 invader for 50 mM of MgCl2 in a TE buffer. The diffusion process was recorded with CLSM (Extended Data Fig. 5b). The DNA condensates were finally diluted 100 times (corresponding to 0.4 μM of m barcode), so that the ratio of Atto488-m*PNA/m was 12.5/1. FRAP experiments were performed on p(A20-mAtto594)n chains of the fully invaded DNA condensates by a PNA invader with the ROI bleaching methods described above (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e).

Here 0.5 g l–1 of p(A20-m)n was prepared in 10 μl of TE buffer and heated at 95 °C for 15 min. The cleaved p(A20-m)n was either mixed with a stoichiometric amount of m*Atto488 (PNA or DNA invader) or dissolved alone at a concentration of 0.04 g l–1 (3.2 μM) in a TE buffer with 50 mM of MgCl2. Temperature-dependent ultraviolet–visible spectra were measured from 20 °C to 80 °C (1 °C min–1) and the onset of absorbance increase at 350 nm was used to determine the cloud point temperature.

Since the temperature-induced coacervation of p(A20-m)n is a molecular-weight-dependent phenomenon, it is not possible to cleave the p(A20-m)n before condensate formation as this could lead to a preferred incorporation of long p(A20-m)n, which is unwanted. Therefore, we developed a multistep protocol to cleave the p(A20-m)n chains after DNA condensate formation (Extended Data Fig. 7). The process uses enzymatic cleavage with a restriction enzyme (MluCI) that recognizes restriction sites generated by hybridization between p(A20-m)n and a specifically designed cleaving strand (c*). c* contains a 10-nt sequence that can hybridize to p(A20-m)n, generating restriction sites for the MluCI enzyme, and another 5-nt spacer sequence attached with fluorophores (FITC) at the 5′ end as the reporter for hybridization and subsequent melting events once cleaved. Briefly, c* hybridizes to A20-m, the MluCI cleaves A20-m/c* at its restriction site and then the shorter c* fragments melt away due to their low Tm values.

For this process, the condensates first need to be made dynamic at low [Mg2+] (for the enzyme processing as well as for homogeneous mixing with c* within the condensates) and later made in the arrested state again at high [Mg2+]. To perform the enzymatic cleavage of p(A20-m)n chains within DNA condensates, we first diluted 10 μl of stock solution of non-fluorescent DNA condensates (diluted five times, in 15 mM of MgCl2) into 20 μl of solution containing either 0.1 μM or 0.2 μM of c* (2.5 mol% or 5 mol% relative to 4 μM of A20-m repeat concentration in the total solution, respectively) at 15 mM of MgCl2 in a TE buffer. After 3 h of incubation at room temperature with gentle shaking (300 rpm) for the complete binding of c* into the DNA condensates, 2 μl of the reaction mixture was then diluted into 10 μl of solution containing 0.5 U μl–1 of MluCI restriction enzyme at 15 mM of MgCl2 in a TE buffer for subsequent restriction overnight at room temperature. The final enzyme (U) to p(A20-m)n (μg) ratio was 50 U μg–1. MluCI recognizes a part of the hybridization domain between c* and p(A20-m)n and cleaves the p(A20-m/c*)n chain at this position. After cleavage, both fragments (c*′ and c*″) of the restricted c* only have five base pairs with p(A20-m)n and, thus, dissociate due to their low Tm values. This was confirmed by the disappearance of the fluorescence of c*(-FITC) in the condensates (Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). The amount of cleaved sites, and hence the statistical shortening of p(A20-m)n, depends on the amount of c* added. Afterwards, the [Mg2+] of the 10 μl of the reaction mixture was further adjusted by adding 0.8 μl of TE buffer containing 500 mM of MgCl2 to get a final [Mg2+] of 50 mM. The total 10.8-μl mixture was then stored for at least 1 week for equilibration.

To test the front shape of ballistic wave diffusion, the enzymatically cleaved DNA condensates, in equilibrium with [Mg2+], were further diluted into a solution containing 1 μM of m*-Atto488, 0.25 μM of k*-Atto647 in a TE buffer with a total solution volume of 20 μl at 50-mM MgCl2 in a 384-well plate with 10–20 μl of hexadecane covering it to prevent evaporation. The DNA condensates were, thus, diluted 100 times with m barcode concentration at 0.4 μM in the total solution. The invasion process was then recorded by CLSM (Fig. 4c).

A direct quantification of the p(A20-m)n chain length in cleaved DNA condensates by gel electrophoresis is not possible due to the existence of p(T20-k)n in the system, which can associate with p(A20-m)n and interfere with the mobility of p(A20-m)n chains in gel electrophoresis. Thus, we prepared 20-μl reference solutions containing 0.05 g l–1 of p(A20-m)n (heated previously at 95 °C totally for 30 min, same as the p(A20-m)n used for preparing the DNA condensates) with 2.5 mol% and 5 mol% of c* in a TE buffer at 15 mM of MgCl2 incubated at room temperature for 3 h. Subsequently, 5 μl of 10 U μl–1 of MluCI was added to reach the same enzyme (U) to p(A20-m)n (μg) ratio (50 U μg–1) for overnight cleavage at room temperature. These samples, thus, had the same c* to A20-m ratio and the same enzyme to p(A20-m)n ratio as in the condensates. The samples were then characterized by gel electrophoresis (2 wt% of agarose gel, 5 V cm–1, 150 min in a TAE buffer containing 40 mM of Tris-HCl, 20 mM of acetic acid and 1 mM of EDTA, post-staining by SYBR Gold) to quantify the cleaved chain length compared with the chain length of the non-cleaved p(A20-m)n chains (Extended Data Fig. 7d–f). The chain length distribution and average chain length of cleaved and non-cleaved p(A20-m)n were calculated from the gel electrophoresis result using a previously reported method61,62.

DNA condensates composed of p(A20-mAtto594)n and p(T20-kAtto488)n were prepared at 50 mM of MgCl2. Then, 1 μl of stock solution of DNA condensates (diluted five times, in 50 mM of MgCl2) were diluted to lower MgCl2 concentrations, ranging from 15 mM to 50 mM in a TE buffer with a total volume of 20 μl, yielding an m barcode concentration of 0.4 μM in the solution. The sizes of several condensates were recorded every 24 h for a total time of 120 h. The size of each condensate was then normalized to its initial size to determine the final swelling ratio in equilibrium after 120 h (Fig. 4e).

DNA condensates composed of p(A20-mAtto594)n and p(T20-k)n prepared at 50 mM of MgCl2 were diluted by five times to individual MgCl2 concentrations (15–50 mM). Diluted DNA condensates were then stored as stock at 4 °C for at least 1 week to reach equilibrium. For experiments with [MgCl2] ≥ 20 mM, 19 μl of the solution containing m*-Atto488 (1 μM) in the given MgCl2 concentration in a TE buffer was prepared, followed by the addition of 1 μl of DNA condensate stock solution (diluted five times). The 20-μl solution was then added into a 384-well plate with another 10–20 μl of hexadecane added on top of the solution to prevent evaporation during experiments. The final DNA condensates were, thus, diluted 100 times with an m barcode concentration of 0.4 μM in the total solution. The diffusion of m*-Atto488 into the DNA condensates was then recorded by CLSM (Fig. 4d). For experiments with MgCl2 below 20 mM, 1 μl of DNA condensate stock solution was first diluted to 19 μl of TE buffer containing the given MgCl2 concentration and transferred into a 384-well plate. Then, a small amount of concentrated m*-Atto488 was added into the same well, so that the overall m*-Atto488 concentration reached 1 μM in the mixture. Then, 10–20 μl of hexadecane was added on top to prevent evaporation. DNA condensates, which were far away from the concentrated m*-Atto488 spot, were chosen for the observation of the rapid diffusion process. This method is necessary to allow enough time for setting up imaging for the rapid diffusion process at low MgCl2. Direct dilution of DNA condensates into the mixture of invaders resulted in excessively fast completion of the invasion process before transferring and observing under CLSM.

Raman fingerprint measurements were conducted using a custom-built BCARS microscope, extensively described elsewhere64. Briefly, pump–probe and Stokes pulses were generated in a dual-output subnanosecond laser source (CARS-SM-30, Leukos), spatially and temporally overlapped at the sample plane of an inverted microscope (ECLIPSE Ti-U, Nikon). These pulses were then tightly focused onto a sample using a 0.85-numerical-aperture air objective (LCPlan N, Olympus). The samples were prepared by adding 1 µl of condensate solution (diluted five times, at individual MgCl2 concentrations) into 19 µl of TE buffer with the same concentration of MgCl2. The 20-µl samples were placed within a sealed channel created by attaching double-sided tape strips between a glass coverslip and a glass slide and positioned with the coverslip facing the objective. The BCARS signal was filtered from the excitation pulses and focused onto the slit of a spectrograph (Shamrock 303i, Andor), which disperses the spectral components on a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Newport DU920P-BR-DD, Andor). A piezo stage (Nano-PDQ 375 HS, Mad City Labs) was used to raster scan the samples. Data acquisition was controlled using LabView 2015 (National Instruments) software, and its processing was carried out using IgorPro (WaveMetrics). The Raman-like spectra were obtained through a modified Kramers–Kronig transform65, and background phase removal was performed using a Savitzky–Golay filter with a third-order polynomial along a B-spline baseline.

DNA condensates containing 80% m barcode and 20% q barcode (obtained by using a mixture of p(A20-m)n and p(A20-q)n during condensate formation) were used for DNAzyme56 encapsulation by q/q* hybridization. Here 5 μl of DNA condensates (1.6 μM of q barcode and 6.4 μM of m barcode) were mixed with 1 μl of q*-DNAzyme (8 μM) and 2 μl of m* (50 μM) into a total of 12 μl of TE buffer containing 50 mM of MgCl2 for 1 h for complete DNAzyme encapsulation and invasion-induced arrested-to-dynamic transition of DNA condensates. For arrested DNA condensates loaded with DNAzyme, the same solution was prepared, except m* was not added. A substrate solution was prepared by mixing 2 μl of p-A1000 (2 μM, synthesized by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase31), 2 μl of p*-substrate (400 nM) and 1 μl of RNase inhibitor (40 U μl–1 (Thermo Scientific)) into a total of 8 μl of TE buffer containing 50 mM of MgCl2 for 1 h for complete hybridization between p-A1000 and p*-substrate. Then, the substrate solution was introduced into the solution containing arrested or dynamic DNAzyme-loaded DNA condensates. The reaction was monitored under CLSM (Extended Data Fig. 10).

To perform force spectroscopy on condensates, we added condensates (before or after invasion, in a TE buffer containing 50 mM of MgCl2) into an AFM liquid cell on a glass slide on top of the stage of the inverted microscope. The AFM colloid probe (borosilicate glass bead diameter = 18.2 ± 1 μm; spring constant = 0.6 N m–1) was then approached to the top of a condensate under the microscope. The force spectroscopy measurement was then conducted in the contact mode. For each condensate type, we measured over five force spectroscopy curves in a compression–retraction cycle, and the hysteresis is quantified by integrating the area within the compression–retraction curves.

All data points featuring statistical analysis are presented as mean ± s.d. or mean ± standard error. The sample size (n) for each statistical analysis is reported in the relevant figure legend. FRAP, FLIM and AFM measurements were performed on several condensates from two independent samples. Diffusion mechanisms tuned by chain length and salinity were measured on several condensates from two independent samples. BCARS measurements were performed on several condensates from three independent samples. Titration and swelling experiments were carried out on several condensates from a series of samples at each condition. Diffusion kinetics were measured from four independent samples at each condition. P values are calculated by one-way analysis of variance test. Statistical analysis was carried out using Origin 2023 (v10.0.0.154) and Microsoft Excel (Version 2307).

a, Schematic representation for the enzymatic synthesis of circular template by T4 Ligase and subsequent removal of non-circular strands by Exonuclease I and Exonuclease III. The circular template is then used for the enzymatic synthesis of DNA polymers (p(A20-m)n and p(T20-k)n) by rolling circle amplification (RCA) using Φ29 DNA polymerase and a primer. b, Background-subtracted gel electrophoresis image of p(A20-m)n and p(T20-k)n after thermal cleavage at 95 °C for 30 min in total. Quantification of chain length of p(A20-m)n and p(T20-k)n is shown in the right plot. The molecular weight is reported as nucleotide number (nt), corresponding to double of the calibrated base pair number (bp). Average repeats of p(A20-m)74 can be calculated. p(T20-k)n has a tailing to higher molecular weights (n > 90). This material is used for preparing the DNA condensates. c, Scheme for the preparation of DNA condensates by a heating ramp applied to a solution of 0.5 g/L of p(A20-m)n, and 0.0625 g/L p(T20-k)n incubated in TE buffer containing 50 mM MgCl2 at 95 °C for 20 min, followed by cooling to room temperature. The heating and cooling rate are both 3 °C/s. The formed condensates are composed of a p(A20-m)n core and a p(T20-k)n shell, that can be individually addressed by the complementary strands (m* and k*) conjugated with fluorophores. Details can be found in our preceding publications31,33. d, Representative CLSM image showing the resulting DNA condensates with the bottom images showing the respectively addressed p(A20-m)n core by m*-Atto488 (left, green channel) and p(T20-k)n shell by k*-Atto647 (right, blue channel). Note the thin blue shell. Gel source data is provided. The scale bars are all 10 μm.

The condensates were invaded by 1 μM non-fluorescent m* to become dynamic and mixed with 10 μM Cy5-20nt-dummy (magenta channel). The shell of the condensates was labeled with a small amount of k*-Atto488 (0.5 μM, green channel) for identification, as inside the white dashed circle. 3 s bleaching was applied in the centre pixel (indicated by the white cross in prebleach image) in the condensate before taking post-bleaching images. c, Representative cross-sectional line profiles along the white dashed lines in post-bleaching images in b for a dynamic/invaded condensate over time, giving Gaussian distribution of the fluorescence intensity, which represents Brownian motion of the bleached Cy5-20nt-dummy strands. The line profiles can be fitted with Gaussian fit to obtain their squared standard deviation (σ2) at different time points. σ2 changes over time during fluorescence recovery. The diffusion coefficients (D) of Cy5-20nt-dummy strands can be extracted by plotting σ2 over time with the slope being 2D63. The same method was also applied on the arrested/non-invaded DNA condensates. d, Representative σ2 for Cy5-20nt-dummy in arrested/non-invaded and dynamic/invaded condensates, respectively. e, Comparison of diffusion coefficients of dummy strands in non-invaded and invaded DNA condensates (mean ± s.d., N = 6 condensates measured).

The onset of the increase in absorbance indicates the Tcp. h, Comparison of Tcp for p(A20-m)n with and without hybridized PNA or DNA m* invaders (mean, N = 2 condensates measured). Scale bars for all are 10 μm. Summary: These experiments demonstrate the importance of introducing repulsive charges for regulating the dynamic properties of the invaded condensate. The invasion by a DNA invader brings more charges into the condensate, which generates stronger repulsive electrostatic force within and between DNA chains. Thus, it leads to higher swelling of the invaded condensate and a transition from arrested to dynamic interior. PNA is a poor solubilizer. The absence of a high intensity front in b is due to the persistence of the arrested nature of invaded condensates and a lack of swelling in the process.

Rationale: Shortening of the p(A20-m)n strands cannot be done before condensate preparation because excessively shortened strands might not integrate into the condensates due to the molecular weight dependence of the LCST behavior31. Hence, we applied restriction inside the condensate. a, Scheme for the design of the enzymatic restriction by MluCI on p(A20-m)n chains with help of a cleaving strand (c*) inside the condensates. c* hybridizes to p(A20-m)n and generates a recognition site for the restriction enzyme MluCI. The ratio of [c*]/[A20-m] codes the extent of cleavage. c* contains a spacer (A5) with a fluorophore (FITC) at the 5' end. Before cleavage, c* has 10 base pairs with p(A20-m)n (Tm ≈ 40.2 – 44.4 °C, Supplementary Method 3) and will thus bind tightly at experimental temperature (room temperature). After cleavage, both subparts (c*' and c*”) of the c* only have 5 base pairs with p(A20-m)n (Tm ≈ 0 °C and 3.4 – 11.6 °C, respectively, Supplementary Method 3) and will thus melt off. The fluorophore at the 5' end of the cleaving strand serves as a reporter for monitoring the restriction as fluorescence vanishes from the condensates into the surrounding. The finally cleaved DNA condensates will not contain any cleaved subparts of c* due to their low Tms, but only contain shorter p(A20-m)n chains. b, Representative CLSM images showing the enzymatic restriction of DNA condensates loaded with sub-stoichiometric amount c* (10 mol%). c, Restriction kinetics (light green) indicated by decrease of normalized fluorescence intensity within DNA condensate. Conditions: 0.04 μM c* = 10 mol% of [A20-m], 0.5 U/μL MluCI enzyme, 15 mM MgCl2, room temperature (mean ± s.d., N = 2 kinetic experiments). d, Gel electrophoresis of non-cleaved (with 0 mol% c*) and cleaved p(A20-m)n (with 2.5 and 5 mol% c*).

Metrics details

Diagnosing and treating skin diseases require advanced visual skills across domains and the ability to synthesize information from multiple imaging modalities. While current deep learning models excel at specific tasks such as skin cancer diagnosis from dermoscopic images, they struggle to meet the complex, multimodal requirements of clinical practice. Here we introduce PanDerm, a multimodal dermatology foundation model pretrained through self-supervised learning on over 2 million real-world skin disease images from 11 clinical institutions across 4 imaging modalities. We evaluated PanDerm on 28 diverse benchmarks, including skin cancer screening, risk stratification, differential diagnosis of common and rare skin conditions, lesion segmentation, longitudinal monitoring, and metastasis prediction and prognosis. PanDerm achieved state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated tasks, often outperforming existing models when using only 10% of labeled data. We conducted three reader studies to assess PanDerm's potential clinical utility. PanDerm outperformed clinicians by 10.2% in early-stage melanoma detection through longitudinal analysis, improved clinicians' skin cancer diagnostic accuracy by 11% on dermoscopy images and enhanced nondermatologist healthcare providers' differential diagnosis by 16.5% across 128 skin conditions on clinical photographs. These results show PanDerm's potential to improve patient care across diverse clinical scenarios and serve as a model for developing multimodal foundation models in other medical specialties, potentially accelerating the integration of artificial intelligence support in healthcare.

There is a pressing need to fully harness the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnosing and managing skin diseases. Although deep learning has shown remarkable performance, often matching or surpassing dermatologists, current AI models for dermatology remain limited to isolated tasks, such as diagnosing skin cancer from dermoscopic images1. These models struggle to integrate various data types and imaging modalities, reducing their utility in different real-world clinical settings. Dermatology, like internal medicine, is inherently complex, encompassing a broad spectrum of conditions from common dermatoses to life-threatening malignancies, necessitating a comprehensive, patient-centered approach that integrates various clinical workflows.

In clinical practice, diagnosing and treating skin conditions involves a range of tasks, including total-body skin cancer detection and risk assessment2,3,4,5, differential diagnosis of hundreds of dermatological conditions such as inflammatory dermatoses and pigmentary disorders6, multimodal image analysis7,8, pathology interpretation9,10, monitoring lesion changes11,12 and predicting outcomes13,14. The absence of integrated AI solutions capable of supporting these various workflows currently hampers the practical impact of AI in dermatology. Recent advances in foundation models have emerged as a promising direction to address this challenge15,16.

Foundation models are large-scale neural networks pretrained on vast, diverse data using self-supervised learning techniques, often leveraging weakly labeled or unlabeled data17,18,19. Built on rich knowledge representations, these models have shown impressive performance across medical fields such as ophthalmology20, radiology21 and pathology22,23,24,25. Through comprehensive pretraining on large and diverse data, these models develop versatile representations that can effectively adapt to various clinical scenarios, outperforming previous deep learning models in downstream tasks. Their strong feature representations also enable data-efficient applications26,27, requiring fewer labeled samples, which is particularly crucial for medical domains in which expert-annotated data are often limited.

However, developing effective foundation models for dermatology presents unique challenges. The performance of foundation models is inherently linked to the scale of their parameters and training data28,29,30. In general computer vision, foundation models are pretrained on massive datasets such as ImageNet31 or JFT-300M (ref. 32) and most existing dermatology AI models still rely on these models for downstream adaptation. Some efforts have focused on self-supervised learning specifically for dermatology using public datasets33,34 or web-sourced skin images35. However, these approaches are often limited by dataset size, diversity or the lack of real patient data. Moreover, while recent advances in medical foundation models have shown promise in various specialties, they cannot fully address dermatology's unique needs. Specialty-specific foundation models20,21,23 typically focus on single imaging modalities, while general biomedical models, despite their broad scope, struggle with domain-specific data scarcity and integrating heterogeneous modalities for comprehensive clinical analysis.

Here we introduce PanDerm, a general-purpose, multimodal dermatology foundation model. Uniquely designed to integrate multiple imaging modalities, PanDerm is pretrained on over 2 million images sourced from 11 institutions across multiple countries, covering 4 imaging modalities spanning diverse dermatological conditions (Fig. 1a–c). In the pretraining stage, PanDerm uses the masked latent modeling and contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP)36 feature alignment for self-supervised learning (Fig. 1e and Methods), showing superior data scalability and training efficiency compared with existing self-supervised algorithms (Fig. 1f). The model achieves unified representation learning across total-body photography (TBP) and clinical, dermoscopic and dermatopathology images, enabling comprehensive patient analysis throughout diverse clinical workflows (Fig. 1d).

a–c, Pretraining dataset: 2.1 million dermatological images from 11 clinical sources across 4 modalities, shown by modality (a), source (b) and institution (c). d, PanDerm interprets multiple imaging modalities for various dermatology tasks, evaluated in real-world melanoma screening and three reader studies. Image types include dermatopathology (microscopic biopsy specimens), clinical (wide-field lesion and surrounding skin), dermoscopic (close-up dermoscope images) and TBP tiles (lesion crops). e, Architecture: ViT-large encoder, regressor and CLIP-based teacher model, with representation reconstruction and CLIP latent alignment objectives. f, Performance versus pretraining data size and epochs (average AUROC on 8 benchmarks) compared with alternative strategies. g, PanDerm outperforms existing models on 28 evaluation datasets across 4 modalities. All icons in d are from Flaticon.com, except for the risk stratification, lesion change detection and survival analysis icons, which are from Microsoft PowerPoint.

We systematically evaluate PanDerm across 28 benchmarks (Fig. 1g), covering a diverse array of clinical tasks, including screening, risk stratification, phenotype assessment, nevus counting, longitudinal monitoring, lesion change detection, diagnosis of both common and rare skin conditions and skin lesion segmentation, as well as recurrence prediction and prognosis. PanDerm achieves state-of-the-art performance on all tasks, often using only 5–10% of the labeled training data typically required. Through three reader studies, we show that this unified multimodal approach outperforms clinicians in early-stage melanoma detection, enhances clinicians' diagnostic accuracy in skin cancer diagnosis and supports nonspecialist healthcare providers in the differential diagnosis of diverse skin conditions. These findings highlight the potential of specialty-specific foundation models to advance medical practice by integrating diverse modalities, with broader implications for AI development across healthcare specialties.

To evaluate PanDerm's effectiveness, we conducted systematic analyses examining how model performance scales with training data and computational resources (datasets described in Supplementary Table 1). First, compared with existing dermatology-specific models, PanDerm showed strong scalability as training data increased from 0.8 to 1.8 million skin images (Fig. 1f, left). Notably, it achieved superior performance to SwAVDerm35, a leading dermatology self-supervised learning model, using 33% less training data. When compared with other self-supervised training techniques, PanDerm showed remarkable computational efficiency, requiring only 200 training epochs to achieve the best performance, compared with 500–800 epochs needed by leading methods such as MILAN37, DINOv2 (ref. 38) and MAE19 (Fig. 1f, right). Furthermore, PanDerm also surpassed vision-language models such as CLIP36, MONET39 and biomedical-specific CLIP (BiomedCLIP)40 in benchmark evaluations (Supplementary Table 1), while showing emergent capabilities in dermatology similar to those of DINOv2 in natural images, with linear probing performance comparable to full-parameter fine-tuning (Supplementary Table 2). When evaluated against generalist biomedical foundation models, PanDerm showed substantial advantages across different dermatological tasks. Compared with a representative model in this category, BiomedGPT41, PanDerm showed 20.9% better area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) in melanoma detection, 34.7% higher weighted F1 score in differentiating between skin conditions and 19.6% improved weighted F1 in analyzing microscopic skin tissue images (Extended Data Table 1). Even using computationally efficient methods, PanDerm maintained its advantages, outperforming both linear-probe and fine-tune versions of BiomedGPT by 14.3% and 5.1%, respectively, in linear probing (Supplementary Table 3). On the basis of these promising results, we expanded our evaluation to compare PanDerm with three representative AI models: SL-Imagenet31 and DINOv2 (ref. 38) (both widely used foundation models pretrained on natural images with a ViT-Large42 backbone), and SwAVDerm35 (a self-supervised model pretrained on a large skin image dataset from search engines).

We systematically evaluated PanDerm diagnostic performance across 10 public datasets from 4 imaging modalities and 7 international sites (Fig. 2a). These datasets covered multi-class classification of pigmented neoplastic lesions and binary melanoma diagnosis tasks. PanDerm consistently outperformed all other models, achieving significant improvements on 9 of 10 datasets, with average gains of 5.1%, 8.0%, 4.2% and 0.9% on dermoscopic, clinical, TBP and pathology datasets, respectively (Fig. 2a). On representative dermoscopy and clinical benchmarks such as HAM10000 (ref. 34) and PAD-UFES-20 (ref. 43), PanDerm surpassed the next-best models by 4.7% (P < 0.001) and 9.0% (P < 0.001), respectively (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 4 and Extended Data Fig. 1).

The error bars in a, c and d show 95% CIs; bar centers in a, c and d represent mean values; dots in b represent mean values. Estimates were computed using nonparametric bootstrapping with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. P values were calculated using a two-sided t-test.

PanDerm showed strong performance even with limited training data, achieving comparable results to other models while using only 10–30% of the labeled images (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Tables 5–10). Additional results for other tasks are presented in Extended Data Fig. 2. To test PanDerm's generalization applicability, we evaluated its performance on melanoma diagnosis using images from seven external medical centers, representing patient populations different from the training data. PanDerm showed significant superiority over all pretrained models, achieving higher AUROC scores across all external datasets (Fig. 2c). Notably, it maintained high performance even on clinical photographs that were not used during training, with AUROC gains of 4.0%, 2.6% and 2.1% on the three external clinical datasets (all P < 0.001).

Beyond skin cancer diagnosis, we evaluated PanDerm's ability to diagnose a broader range of skin conditions commonly seen in clinical practice. We tested on three complementary datasets: the public DermNet dataset44 covering 23 common conditions, along with two internal datasets (MMT-09 with 9 conditions and MMT-74 with 74 conditions) comprising 38,476 clinical images across 9 broad and 74 fine-grained skin conditions. These datasets comprehensively cover inflammatory diseases, infections, various types of skin tumors and other frequently encountered skin problems. As shown in Fig. 2d, PanDerm achieved weighted F1 improvements of 3.2%, 7.1% and 8.2% on MMT-09, DermNet and MMT-74, respectively, compared with the next-best models (all P < 0.001). PanDerm's advantage grew larger as the number of conditions increased, showing its strong capability to handle complex, multi-disease scenarios. PanDerm also outperformed all other pretrained models on all metrics across the three datasets (all P < 0.001; Supplementary Table 11). In the DermNet dataset, PanDerm exceeded the next-best model's area under the precision–recall curve (AUPR) by 14.7%. Further details on the experimental setup, datasets and metrics are provided in Methods.

Monitoring suspicious melanocytic lesions over a 3-month period is a widely accepted procedure for early melanoma detection, as changes often prompt excision to rule out melanoma, while stability can be reassuring12. We evaluated PanDerm's ability to detect subtle changes in lesions over time by analyzing pairs of sequential dermoscopic images. To ensure accurate comparison despite variations in imaging conditions, we developed a comprehensive image-processing system that standardizes image quality and alignment (Extended Data Fig. 3). This processing system, combined with PanDerm's advanced lesion change detection capabilities45, significantly improved change detection accuracy from 0.596 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.567–0.624) to 0.706 (95% CI 0.686–0.725) in sequential digital dermoscopic imaging data (SDDI1) (Fig. 3a,c) (P < 0.001) and from 0.683 (95% CI 0.517–0.894) to 0.767 (95% CI 0.649–0.886) in SDDI2 (Fig. 3b,c, left) (P < 0.001). Using the optimized pipeline for all models, PanDerm achieved AUROC improvements of 4.3% in SDDI1 (P < 0.001) and 3.7% in SDDI2 over the next-best model (Fig. 3c, middle). For lesions later diagnosed as malignant, PanDerm achieved an AUROC of 0.840 (95% CI 0.769–0.911), surpassing the next-best model by 15.0% (P < 0.01) (Fig. 3c, right). Further details on the lesion change detection method and dataset details are provided in Methods and Supplementary Tables 12–14.

We explored PanDerm's potential to predict melanoma progression from dermoscopic images, an emerging approach that could provide valuable prognostic information at the time of diagnosis13,14,46 (Fig. 3e). We evaluated this capability using 680 dermoscopic images from 370 patients with invasive primary melanoma across multiple international centers (Fig. 3f). PanDerm showed exceptional accuracy in distinguishing melanomas likely to metastasize, achieving an AUROC of 0.964 (95% CI 0.937–0.991), surpassing the next-best model by 2.0% (P = 0.073) (Fig. 3d). It also showed strong capability in differentiating between local and distant metastases, outperforming existing methods by 2.8% (P < 0.05) in the weighted F1 score (Supplementary Table 15).

To validate PanDerm's clinical utility for patient risk stratification, we conducted survival analyses using Kaplan–Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression. Patients classified as high risk by PanDerm showed significantly shorter recurrence-free intervals (RFIs) compared with those in the low-risk group (hazard ratio (HR) 5.63; 95% CI 2.87–11.02, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3g). When compared alongside standard clinical risk factors—including sex, age, Breslow thickness, ulceration, dermal mitosis, location and melanoma subtype—PanDerm's predictions emerged as the strongest indicator of recurrence risk in multivariate Cox regression (Fig. 3h). It maintained high predictive accuracy over extended follow-up periods, with time-dependent areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.950 (95% CI 0.910–0.991), 0.931 (95% CI 0.887–0.976) and 0.909 (95% CI 0.880–0.937) at 3 years, 5 years and 7 years, exceeding multi-clinical variables by 6.8%, 2.9% and 5.0%, respectively (Fig. 3i). Combining PanDerm's predictions with clinical factors further improved long-term prognostic accuracy in AUCs at 5 years and 7 years. PanDerm also consistently outperformed other AI approaches (Fig. 3j), showing improvements of 2.3%, 3.0% and 2.5% at 3 years, 5 years and 7 years, respectively. Further details are provided in Methods and Supplementary Tables 16 and 17.

We next evaluated PanDerm's capability in analyzing whole-body imaging (TBP)2,3,47 (Fig. 4a). Unlike close-up imaging of individual lesions, TBP enables comprehensive patient-level analysis, particularly for critical melanoma risk factors such as photodamage and nevus count4,5,48. In a cohort of 480 patients with 196,933 lesions from Australia, PanDerm achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.896 (95% CI 0.879–0.913) for photodamage assessment and an AUROC of 0.983 (95% CI 0.979–0.987) for nevus counting, surpassing all other models (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively; Fig. 4b,c,g). Even with limited training data (10% of the full dataset), PanDerm maintained superior performance (Extended Data Fig. 2). In lesion-specific risk stratification, PanDerm also ranked first with an AUROC of 0.705 (95% CI 0.698–0.712) and balanced accuracy (BACC) of 0.657 (95% CI 0.6513–0.663), with all results statistically significant (P < 0.001; Fig. 4d,h).

In a clinical validation study, PanDerm effectively identified malignant lesions among a large number of benign ones (216 malignant versus 197,716 benign lesions) from the high-risk melanoma of patients (HOP) study49 and mind your model (MYM) study50 cohort (Fig. 4e). Using TBP images alone, PanDerm achieved a sensitivity of 0.893, outperforming the next-best model by 4.2% (Fig. 4j, left). When clinical measurements were available for all models, PanDerm maintained its advantage with a 3.5% higher sensitivity (Fig. 4j, right), reaching a sensitivity of 0.893. Significantly, it detected malignant lesions in 79 out of 80 patients while reducing unnecessary examinations by 60.8% compared with melanographers (3,498 versus 8,913 lesions recommended for detailed examination) (Fig. 4j,k and Supplementary Table 18).

We observed that PanDerm's analysis approach aligned well with established clinical practice, particularly the ‘ugly duckling' (UD) concept51 of identifying atypical lesions through comparison with a patient's other lesions. This was shown through UMAP visualization (Fig. 4f), where PanDerm's feature effectively separated suspicious lesions. The clustering patterns in PanDerm's risk assessment (Fig. 4l) showed correspondence closely with human screening patterns (Fig. 4i), illustrating its exceptional performance in malignant lesion screening. Additional details are provided in Methods, Supplementary Tables 18–21 and Extended Data Fig. 4.

We evaluated PanDerm's performance on skin lesion segmentation using the ISIC2018 (ref. 52) and HAM10000 (ref. 34) datasets. Compared with existing methods including SL-Imagenet, autoSMIM33 and BATFormer33, PanDerm achieved significantly higher performance, surpassing the next best by 3.1% and 1.9% in the Jaccard index on both datasets (P < 0.001; Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). PanDerm's performance was particularly noteworthy in label-limited scenarios, matching the next-best model while using only 5% of the training data (104 and 350 images for ISIC2018 and HAM10000, respectively; Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). When compared with MedSAM53, a medical image segmentation foundation model, PanDerm showed slightly better accuracy (0.5% improvement, P = 0.025 and 0.112; Supplementary Table 22). This is particularly impressive as PanDerm achieves this performance without specialized training for image segmentation. In addition, PanDerm offers practical advantages in clinical settings, processing images about four to five times faster than MedSAM while using less computational resources (Supplementary Table 23). Visual examples and detailed performance metrics are provided in Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Tables 22–25.

To assess PanDerm's clinical applicability, we conducted three reader studies evaluating its capabilities across different aspects and modalities of dermatological diagnosis, as follows.

To examine PanDerm's capability in early melanoma detection, we compared it with 12 human reviewers (7 experienced dermatologists and 5 dermatologist trainees) using sequential dermoscopic images from Alfred Hospital54, featuring multiple follow-up images of the same lesions over time. The study evaluated two key aspects: overall diagnostic accuracy and early melanoma detection capability. In terms of overall accuracy, PanDerm outperformed the average human reviewer by 10.2% and surpassed the best-performing human by 3.6%. For early detection, we assessed the time point of the first suspicious changes detected in sequential images relative to clinical diagnosis and biopsy confirmation. PanDerm showed superior ability in this challenging task, correctly identifying 77.5% (69 out of 89) of melanoma lesions at the first imaging time point, compared with only 32.6% (29 correct diagnoses) for human reviewers (Extended Data Fig. 7). Individual dots in the histograms represent the earliest correct diagnosis time points for both PanDerm and human reviewers, visualizing the comparative early detection performance.

We evaluated PanDerm's impact on clinicians' diagnostic accuracy across seven pigmented lesion classes using dermoscopic images (Fig. 5a). The study included 41 clinicians with varying levels of competency who evaluated cases both with and without PanDerm's multi-probability prediction support. PanDerm's assistance significantly increased overall diagnostic accuracy from 0.69 (95% CI 0.65–0.73) to 0.80 (95% CI 0.76–0.84, P < 0.001; Fig. 5b). Notably, clinicians with lower competency levels showed the greatest improvement, with accuracy gains of 17% (P = 0.0082) for those with low competency and 12% (P < 0.001) for those with medium competency, while highly competent clinicians showed a 6% improvement (P = 0.039; Fig. 5c and Supplementary Table 26). Class-specific analysis revealed significant accuracy improvements in 4 of 7 lesion classes (P < 0.05; Fig. 5d and Supplementary Table 27). For melanoma diagnosis specifically, PanDerm enhanced clinician accuracy from 0.69 (95% CI 0.64–0.74) to 0.83 (95% CI 0.79–0.87, P < 0.001). In addition, PanDerm alone achieved diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of clinicians with PanDerm assistance (0.81 versus 0.80; P = 0.779).

a, Reader study overview: 41 users answered 3,320 questions on the ISIC2018 Task 3 test set (n = 1,511 images, 7 classes). b, Diagnostic accuracy comparison: without versus with PanDerm support (P < 0.001; two-sided paired t-test; n = 41 readers). c, Accuracy comparison without versus with PanDerm by experience level based on experience per experience: low (n = 11), medium (n = 21) and high (n = 9). d, Accuracy comparison without versus with PanDerm by diagnostic class based on readings per class: MEL (n = 332), BCC (n = 166), AKIEC (n = 166), BKL (n = 166), NV (n = 498), DF (n = 166) and VASC (n = 166). The error bars represent 95% CIs; bar centers represent means.

We conducted a comprehensive reader study evaluating PanDerm's diagnostic capabilities across 128 skin conditions using clinical photos. The study included 37 readers from 5 countries (Fig. 6b) and comprised 2 groups (Fig. 6a): the dermatology group (n = 20; 11 dermatology trainees and 9 specialists) and the generalist group (n = 17; 7 pre-vocational trainees, 8 GPs, 1 nurse and 1 clinical trial assistant). This grouping represents the distinction in specialty training backgrounds between dermatology-trained practitioners and those with general medical training. Each reader assessed up to 50 cases from a 200-case pool, providing their top 3 diagnoses both with and without PanDerm's assistance. Four experienced dermatologists developed a standardized ontology for condition categorization (Extended Data Fig. 8). Performance was assessed primarily using 2 metrics: a 4-point diagnostic assessment scale for top 1 diagnosis (4, exact ontology match, to 1, significant mismatch) and top 3 diagnostic accuracy, with 3 independent dermatologists scoring and resolving discrepancies through panel review. PanDerm's assistance significantly improved the average top 1 diagnostic scores of all readers from 2.83 to 3.08 (P < 0.001; Fig. 6c) and top 3 diagnostic accuracy from 54% to 63.4% (P < 0.001; Fig. 6d), while increasing readers' diagnostic confidence (2.17 to 2.42, P < 0.001; Fig. 6e). The impact was particularly pronounced in the generalist group, showing higher diagnosis modification rates (28.6% versus 12.9% in the dermatology group; Fig. 6f) and greater improvements in both top 1 diagnostic scores (generalist group, +0.45; dermatology group, +0.25; Fig. 6g) and top 3 accuracy (generalist group, +16.5%; dermatology group, +10.3%; Fig. 6h). Analysis by condition classes showed consistent improvements across inflammatory, neoplastic and other categories (P < 0.05; Fig. 6i,j), with inflammatory conditions showing the largest gains (+0.36 in top 1 diagnostic scores, +14.2% in top 3 accuracy). Furthermore, when used independently, PanDerm achieved higher diagnostic accuracy than both unassisted readers (top 1 scores: 3.6 versus 2.83; P < 0.001) and human–AI collaboration (top 1 scores: 3.6 versus 3.08; P < 0.001). Further details on the setup, methodology, reader statistics and datasets of all three reader studies are provided in Methods, Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Tables 26–29.

Despite significant advances in AI technology, its application in clinical medicine remains fragmented and underutilized. Current AI systems are often restricted to isolated tasks and are unable to address the diverse demands of medical decision-making. This limits the potential of AI in supporting clinicians in disease diagnosis and management. Dermatology, with its complex requirements, including holistic patient assessment, lesion-specific analysis and potential use of various imaging modalities, serves as an ideal use case for showing AI's capabilities across multiple interconnected clinical tasks. Success in this domain could pave the way for broader adoption of AI models across healthcare.

In this study, we introduce PanDerm, a versatile dermatology foundation model trained through self-supervised learning on over two million multimodal dermatological images. Central to PanDerm's development was the curation of a large and diverse image dataset sourced primarily from in-house collections and carefully selected public repositories. This approach contrasts with previous efforts, such as SwAVDerm35, which relied on web-sourced skin data, inadvertently incorporating images from commonly used benchmarks such as ISIC55 and DermNet44, increasing the risk of data leakage and compromising evaluation validity. Our strategy minimizes this risk, ensuring that benchmark evaluations accurately reflect real-world model performance.

To evaluate PanDerm's clinical utility, we conducted validations across 28 benchmark datasets, spanning comprehensive skin cancer assessment and a diverse set of primary care dermatological conditions. For skin cancer-related assessment, PanDerm outperformed existing models in specialized tasks across various modalities, including risk stratification of lesions, phenotype assessment, detection of lesion changes and malignancy, multi-class cancer diagnosis, lesion segmentation, and metastasis prediction and prognosis. In particular, PanDerm achieved the most results using only 10% of the task-specific training data typically required by existing models, helping alleviate the scarcity of specialist-labeled data in medical AI. In primary care dermatology settings, PanDerm also outperformed comparative models in diagnosing a diverse set of conditions such as inflammatory diseases, infectious conditions and frequently encountered dermatoses. These capabilities stem from its rich knowledge representation, developed through pretraining on varied dermatological image modalities and conditions, leading to consistent and significant performance improvements across tasks and modalities.

Three reader studies further supported these benchmark findings, suggesting PanDerm's potential to assist clinical practice across different healthcare settings and specialty training backgrounds. In skin cancer diagnosis, PanDerm showed capabilities to improve diagnostic accuracy across clinicians of varying competence levels and identify concerning lesions before clinician detection—potentially facilitating earlier intervention. In general dermatology, PanDerm improved readers' differential diagnosis across various skin conditions (for example, inflammatory dermatoses, cutaneous neoplasms and pigmentary disorders), with more substantial benefits observed among generalists (for example, primary care providers) evaluating inflammatory conditions—a considerable portion of everyday dermatological consultations. Given limited specialist access in primary care settings where most skin conditions are initially evaluated56,57, these findings indicate PanDerm's potential to address dermatological expertise gaps across healthcare settings through both its technical capabilities and clinical applications. Importantly, across both human–AI collaboration studies, PanDerm alone performed equivalently to clinicians with PanDerm assistance in skin cancer diagnosis and even outperformed human–AI collaboration in differential diagnosis, similar to observations in a previous study58 showing ‘no significant difference between large language model (LLM)-augmented physicians and LLM alone'. This phenomenon probably stems from clinicians' selective incorporation of AI recommendations rather than blind adherence, representing a balanced clinical implementation in which practitioners maintain their diagnostic autonomy while still benefiting from AI support.

The scaling behavior observed in PanDerm's performance aligns with recent foundation model trends20,22,23,59, although achieving this in dermatology required addressing unique challenges in medical data acquisition and integration. Our analysis revealed two key technical insights: first, using CLIP36 as a teacher model achieved superior training data efficiency (Fig. 1f), outperforming the most representative method, DINOv2 (ref. 38)—particularly valuable given healthcare's dataset limitations compared with the typical requirement of DINOv2 of 142 million images. Second, the masked feature reconstruction approach proved more effective at capturing subtle diagnostic features than methods such as MAE19. These advantages enabled PanDerm to improve upon both traditional models42,60 and recent generalist medical models such as BiomedGPT41. While generalist models advance broader biomedical AI, our results suggest that specialty-specific foundation models designed with clinical workflows in mind may offer more practical solutions for specialties in which multiple imaging modalities are crucial.

Despite promising results, we acknowledge several limitations in our evaluation scope and methodology. While our validation covered approximately 200 skin conditions across major categories (for example, inflammatory diseases, infections, neoplasms, benign growths, pigmented lesions and vascular anomalies), this represents only a fraction of known dermatological conditions (over 1,000 diagnoses) and is smaller than some previous studies (for example, ref. 6 with 445 conditions), with limited coverage of rare genetic disorders, complex systemic diseases and clinical variants. Regarding model robustness and fairness, while our benchmark evaluations (Supplementary Tables 30 and 31) show consistent performance across different settings (anatomical locations, age groups, genders and skin tones), several constraints exist: the evaluation mainly reflects overall accuracy rather than disease-specific analysis, has varying disease coverage across anatomical locations and focuses primarily on single imaging modalities. A more comprehensive evaluation framework61 integrating these aspects will be necessary for further assessing PanDerm's robustness. Furthermore, recent studies62,63,64 have highlighted important challenges in dermatological AI systems, particularly in human–AI interactions. Although our evaluations show stable cross-skin-tone performance without explicitly balanced training data (as shown to be necessary in a previous study63), comprehensive bias assessment requires metrics beyond overall accuracy. Another study64 further revealed that equitable stand-alone performance may not translate to unbiased human–AI collaboration, which is crucial for clinical deployment. To address these limitations, future work should develop standardized protocols for cross-demographic evaluations using more comprehensive fairness metrics and investigate biases in human–AI collaborative settings. International collaborations such as ISIC55 will be crucial for creating representative datasets and establishing robust fairness standards.

In conclusion, PanDerm shows the potential of multimodal specialty-specific foundation models in addressing the diverse clinical needs across specialized and routine clinical practice in dermatology. Through comprehensive pretraining on diverse dermatological images and validation across multiple clinical scenarios, the model showed robust performance across different use cases. Our development approach, combining systematic data curation, advanced self-supervised learning and rigorous clinical validation, provides a framework for developing medical AI systems that can adapt to varying levels of clinical expertise and healthcare settings. These findings suggest promising directions for developing foundation models in other medical specialties in which the integration of diverse imaging modalities and complex clinical workflows is crucial for patient care.

We curated an extensive pretraining dataset comprising 2,149,706 unlabeled multimodal skin images to develop PanDerm. This diverse dataset encompasses 4 imaging modalities and 11 data sources: 757,890 (35.3%) TBP tiles, 537,047 (25.4%) dermatopathology tiles, 460,328 (21.4%) clinical images and 384,441 (17.9%) dermoscopic images. This multimodality approach provides a comprehensive representation of skin lesions, enabling the model to learn robust features across different visual representations.

The MYM cohort50 is an in-house dataset studying the natural history of melanocytic nevi from 193 Australian participants recruited from the electoral roll. Three-dimensional (3D) TBP was conducted using VECTRA WB360 (Canfield Scientific), capturing 92 cross-polarized two-dimensional (2D) images with standardized lighting to create a 3D avatar. The average lesion tiles per subject was approximately 500. The final dataset comprises 405,856 automatically detected lesion image tiles ≥2 mm in diameter. Demographic information is available in Supplementary Table 32.

The HOP study49 is an in-house sequential dataset of high-risk melanoma individuals with 314 participants. Three-dimensional TBP imaging used the VECTRA WB360 system following the same protocol as MYM. Demographic and clinical data were collected through standardized questionnaires. More details about demographic information are available in Supplementary Table 33.

These datasets also contain 38,110 dermoscopic images from suspicious lesions, providing complementary visualization of surface and subsurface structures potentially indicative of various skin conditions, particularly melanoma.

The MMT dataset is an in-house collection amassed from over 150 clinics across Australia and New Zealand over a 15-year period. This extensive dataset primarily consists of paired polarized dermoscopic and clinical images. From this comprehensive collection, we curated a subset containing 316,399 dermoscopic images and 310,951 clinical images, providing a rich source of pretraining data for training purposes.

This dataset comprises 54 patients from Queensland, Princess Alexandra Hospital (PAH) (48.1%) and New South Wales Melanoma Institute Australia (NSW MIA) (51.9%), with 57.4% males, aged 19–75 years (mean 53.4). Most patients (81.5%) were classified as ‘very high' risk for melanoma, while others were ‘high' risk (14.8%) or ‘low or average' risk (1.9%). Lesions were predominantly nevi (68.5%, including common, dermal and congenital, and dysplastic, variants), melanomas (24.1%, mostly in situ) and other lesions (7.4%). While 66.7% had single lesions examined, others had 2–5 lesions per patient. Notable diagnostic variability between pathologists was observed. More details are available in Supplementary Table 34.

NSSI is an in-house sequential collection of 29,832 dermoscopic images from 1,254 individuals in Brisbane, Australia (2009–2014). Images were collected using a digital dermatoscope attached to a Fotofinder ATBM imaging system (768 × 576 pixels at 96 dpi). The study included up to 7 time points per participant at 6-month intervals over 3 years. Individual lesions maintained consistent identification numbers across visits. See Supplementary Table 35.

The Educational source 1 (Edu1) and Educational source 2 (Edu2) datasets comprise 81,947 and 67,430 clinical images, respectively, from in-house educational resources. They cover inflammatory and autoimmune disorders (psoriasis, atopic dermatitis), infections (herpes simplex, molluscum contagiosum, tinea corporis), pigmentary disorders (melasma, vitiligo), nail conditions (psoriatic nail disease, onychomycosis), vascular lesions (port-wine stains, pyogenic granulomas), and both benign and malignant tumors (melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma), including rare conditions and genetic disorders.

PanDerm is a self-supervised learning model designed for the dermatology field, built upon the success of existing self-supervised learning techniques in the natural image domain67. At its core, the architecture comprises a ViT-Large visual encoder42, a mask regressor and a CLIP-Large36 teacher model. The ViT-Large encoder, with its 24 transformer blocks and 1,024 dimensional embeddings, processes 224 × 224-pixel images, while the CLIP-Large teacher model handles slightly smaller 196 × 196-pixel inputs. The training process incorporates two primary objectives: masked latent alignment and visible latent alignment loss. Initially, the input image undergoes masking, with the mask ratio proportional to the encoder's complexity (50% for ViT-Large). The encoder then processes visible patches to produce latent representations, while the regressor predicts the latent representations of masked patches using these visible latent and mask tokens. The model focuses on the encoder–regressor structure without a separate decoder component. The regressor assumes the responsibility of predicting the latent representations of masked patches, allowing for more efficient processing and learning. For target supervision, the unmasked image is fed through the CLIP model, generating supervision divided according to visible and masked patch locations. The visible latent alignment loss is directly applied to the latent representations of visible patches computed by the encoder. Concurrently, the masked latent alignment loss acts on the latent representations of masked patches predicted by the regressor. Both of these loss functions use CLIP latent representations as their supervision signals. The regressor in PanDerm operates similarly to a cross-attention mechanism. It uses learnable mask tokens as queries, while the keys and values are derived from the concatenation of visible patch representations and the output of previous layers. This design allows the regressor to effectively infer the content of masked regions based on the context provided by visible areas. Optimization primarily focuses on aligning the visible and masked patch predictions with their corresponding CLIP latent supervisions. This approach enables PanDerm to extract rich, semantically meaningful representations from dermatological images without relying on explicit labels.

For pretraining, we continued to train the model (initially trained on ImageNet-1K) on our dataset of over two million unlabeled multimodal skin images, representing diverse dermatological conditions. We set the batch size on each graphics processing unit (GPU) to 480, with an effective batch size of 1,920. Following masked image modeling practices68, we used a 50% mask ratio. To train our model, we used AdamW as the optimizer with an initial learning rate of 1.5 × 10−3. We apply simple data augmentation such as random resized cropping and horizontal flipping during pretraining. We trained our model for 500 epochs with a warmup of 20 epochs. The pretraining phase used 4 80-GB NVIDIA H100 GPUs and took approximately 5 days and 7 h. We chose the last epoch checkpoint as our final model weights. Please refer to Supplementary Table 36 for more detailed pretraining hyperparameter configurations.

We tested different teacher models, including CLIP-base, CLIP-large, BiomedCLIP40 and MONET39 (dermatology-specific CLIP). CLIP-large outperformed biomedical-specific and dermatology-specific CLIP models, probably owing to the limited data scale of skin images in medical-domain CLIP models. Our model with CLIP-large teachers significantly improved performance and outperformed CLIP-large itself. See Supplementary Table 1 for detailed results.

We explored whether PanDerm's features are ready for downstream tasks without fine-tuning, similar to DINOv2 (ref. 38) in the natural image domain. Our model using simple linear probing performed comparably with expensive full-parameter fine-tuning, suggesting that PanDerm's features are already well suited for diverse downstream multimodal skin-related tasks without requiring further training. Detailed results are in Supplementary Table 2.

For self-supervised learning methods comparison, we evaluated DINOv2 (ref. 38), MAE19 and MILAN37, all using the same ViT-Large backbone. We used the recommended hyperparameter configurations for these models and continued pretraining from their natural image training weights on our pretraining dataset. Subsequently, we fine-tuned these models using identical hyperparameter setups to ensure a fair comparison.

In adapting PanDerm to downstream tasks, only the encoder model is used. For most tasks, PanDerm's feature quality suffices to achieve competitive performance using simple linear probing. This involves applying a linear classifier (that is, logistic regression) to the top of extracted features from the PanDerm encoder to evaluate its performance on downstream tasks. For more challenging tasks requiring higher performance, we opted to fine-tune the PanDerm encoder. The fine-tuning tasks include the three reader studies, short-term change detection, skin lesion segmentation, skin cancer detection in ISIC2024 and TBP-based risk stratification. For all other tasks, we used linear probing. For linear probing, following practices recommended by the self-supervised learning community, we fix the ℓ2 regularization coefficient λ to MC/100, where M is the embedding dimension and C is the number of classes, and use the L-BFGS solver with a maximum of 1,000 iterations. For fine-tuning, we adhere to the BEiT V2 setting68, using cross-entropy loss with a learning rate of 5 × 10−4. We train models for 50 epochs with a warmup of 10 epochs. The model showing the best performance on the validation set is selected as the final model. For detailed hyperparameter configurations, please refer to Supplementary Table 37. In the following sections, we describe tasks with more specific methodological details.

Our proposed sequential data-preprocessing method consists of dark corner removal, skin inpainting, hair removal, image registration and lesion segmentation. For the first two steps, we follow the approach outlined in a previous study69. Given an image with or without dark corner artifacts, we convert it to grayscale and extract the contour using the OpenCV70 binary threshold function (threshold = 100) with the findContours function (RETR_TREE mode and CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE method). We identify the largest contour by calculating the area of all existing contours, capture a circular area using the minEnclosingCircle function, scale to 80% of the original radius and inpaint using the Telea algorithm (radius = 10). For hair removal, we convert to grayscale, apply a black hat morphological operation with a 17 × 17 structuring element, the threshold to create a binary mask, and inpaint. For image registration, we implement the AKAZE71 feature-based approach: detecting key points (descriptor size = 0, threshold = 9 × 10−5, octaves = 4), matching using the Brute Force matcher with Hamming distance, refining with RANSAC to estimate a EuclideanTransform model and warping using skimage.transform.warp with reflection padding and linear interpolation.

Similar to a previous study45, we use a simple Siamese network architecture for change detection, in which two identical visual encoders with shared weights from our foundation model process a pair of sequential lesion images captured over a short time frame. Each encoder extracts features from its respective image. These learned features are then concatenated and passed through two fully connected layers, followed by a softmax layer for final classification. For training this Siamese network in our binary change detection task, we use a contrastive loss function. This loss is particularly well suited for Siamese networks as it helps the model learn to distinguish between pairs of images that have changed and those that have not. The contrastive loss encourages the network to minimize the distance between feature representations of image pairs with no significant changes while maximizing the distance for pairs that show meaningful changes. This approach allows the network to learn a similarity metric between image pairs, rather than simply classifying individual images.

We use a linear probing classifier on our foundation model to predict melanoma metastasis using dermoscopic images from the private ComBineMel dataset. Our evaluation encompasses two scenarios: binary metastasis prediction and multi-class metastasis prediction. In the binary classification, we aim to differentiate between the presence of any metastasis (including local, satellite and in-transit metastases, lymph node recurrence, and distant metastasis) and its absence. The multi-class prediction presents a more complex challenge, categorizing cases into three groups: control (no metastasis); local, satellite and in-transit metastases; and distant metastasis. To enhance the robustness and mitigate potential data selection bias, we perform five iterations of dataset splitting into training and testing sets, stratified by melanoma stage. The model is trained using these fivefold data. We linear probed PanDerm with the setting mentioned above. We then generated out-of-fold predictions for all lesions and compare these with the ground truth for performance evaluation.

Subsequently, we conduct a multivariate Cox regression analysis, incorporating the metastasis prediction score and clinical variables (age, sex, Breslow thickness, ulceration, dermal mitosis, melanoma subtype and lesion location) to predict the RFI. This analysis focuses on earlier stages of melanoma (stages I–II). We visualize the relative contribution of individual variables to prognosis prediction using a forest plot. To analyze the correlation between variables and RFI, we use the Kaplan–Meier method. Patients are stratified into low-risk and high-risk groups based on their binary metastasis prediction scores (median value). The log-rank test is used to assess the classifier's ability to predict survival. To evaluate the predictive accuracy at various time points, we generate time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves and calculate AUCs at 3 years, 5 years and 7 years.

The melanoma screening algorithm is designed to identify high-risk lesions among whole-body images, aiding clinicians in efficiently detecting potential malignancies. Lesions flagged as high risk undergo further triage and dermoscopic examination. The screening model integrates three modules: a risk prediction head, a UD detection head and a machine learning module, using both TBP image data (image tiles) and metadata for comprehensive predictions. We first fine-tune our foundation model, equipped with the risk prediction head, using TBP image tiles to classify lesions as high risk or low risk. All lesion images are resized to 224 × 224 pixels and subjected to data augmentation, including color and geometric transformations. The risk prediction head, comprising a single linear layer, identifies lesions as high risk if subjected to dermoscopy examination and low risk otherwise. The UD detection head leverages the ‘UD sign', an effective diagnostic strategy that compares all lesions from the same patient to identify outliers. This approach capitalizes on lesion contextual information. We use the fine-tuned foundation model to extract deep learning features, which are then processed by the UD detection head. This module calculates the distance between each lesion's features and the average features of all lesions from the same patient, using the interquartile range method to select outlier lesions. The machine learning module, an extra tree classifier, is trained using TBP metadata, which include 32 measurements for each lesion from the 3D TPB machine. This module directly predicts malignancy based on pathology labels. The final screening result combines predictions from all three modules. A lesion is flagged as suggestive of malignancy if any module yields a positive prediction. We evaluate the screening performance at both the lesion and patient levels to ensure comprehensive accuracy assessment.

Weakly supervised slide classification tasks are approached using the established two-stage multiple instance learning framework: (1) extracting instance-level features from tissue regions within the whole slide image (WSI) and (2) developing an order-invariant aggregation method to consolidate patch-level data into slide-level representation. For preprocessing, we use the CLAM toolbox72 for tissue segmentation, partitioning regions into 256 × 256 nonoverlapping sections at ×20 magnification, then resizing to 224 × 224 and normalizing using ImageNet parameters. To evaluate pretrained encoders, we implement the attention-based multiple instance learning algorithm73 with consistent configurations. Our implementation features a two-tier gated ABMIL structure with an initial FC layer mapping to 512-dimensional space, followed by intermediate layers with 384 hidden units. We incorporate dropout regularization (rates 0.10 and 0.25), use the AdamW optimizer74 with a cosine learning rate schedule (initial rate 1 × 10−4, weight decay 1 × 10−5), and use cross-entropy loss. Training runs for 20 epochs with early stopping based on validation loss. We ensure robust evaluation through fivefold cross-validation, stratifying by both case and label attributes.

For skin lesion segmentation, we use a conventional segmentation paradigm, using a network encoder connected to a segmentation decoder and head. Our proposed PanDerm serves as the encoder in this setup. We benchmark PanDerm against three established models: ViT-Large42, autoSMIM33 and BATFormer75. Both ViT and PanDerm use an UperNet decoder, following the official ViT implementation. For autoSMIM and BATFormer, we adhere to their official repository settings. ViT-Large and autoSMIM encoders are initialized with ImageNet pretrained weights. To ensure a fair comparison, all images are resized to 224 × 224. We apply online data augmentation, including color jittering, random rotation and random flipping, to mitigate overfitting. The training uses an AdamW optimizer with an initial learning rate of 5 × 10−4 and a weight decay of 0.01, with the learning rate decaying according to a cosine schedule. The models are trained for 100 epochs, and we save the model that achieves the best evaluation metrics on the validation set.

We fine-tuned our foundation model on the private SDDI–Alfred dataset54 using a tenfold cross-validation approach. We used cross-entropy loss with a learning rate of 5 × 10−4. We train models for 50 epochs with a warmup of 10 epochs. The model showing the best AUROC on the validation set is selected as the final model. We then used an out-of-fold prediction approach to generate melanoma predictions for all sequential images. For each image sequence, we recorded the time point at which the model first made a correct diagnosis of melanoma; otherwise, the model was considered to have failed in detecting the melanoma. While biopsy serves as our reference standard, we aimed to explore the algorithm's potential to detect early signs of melanoma progression. Our study focused on identifying suspicious changes in sequential images before clinical diagnosis, with the goal of enabling earlier intervention when melanomas are most treatable. For the human evaluation, 12 clinicians—seven dermatologists with over 5 years of experience and five dermatology residents with less than 5 years of experience—were invited to assess the serial dermoscopic data. The images were presented to the reviewers using Qualtrics (Provo), with the reviewers blinded to the true diagnoses. For each case, information such as the patient's age, sex, lesion location and date of imaging was provided. Initially, only the first dermoscopic image in the sequence was shown, and reviewers were asked to classify the lesion as either benign or malignant. As they progressed through the sequence, side-by-side image comparisons were made available to assess changes over time. Once a diagnosis was submitted, it could not be revised. To mitigate bias, we included ten single time-point melanoma images, preventing reviewers from assuming that the first image in a series was benign. We then compared the diagnostic performance of the clinicians with our model, focusing on the time point at which a malignant diagnosis was first made by either the clinicians or the algorithm.

The reader study was conducted using DermaChallenge, a web-based platform developed and hosted by the Medical University of Vienna for online education on dermatoscopy, as described in previous studies76,77. To ensure proper authentication and data management, readers were required to register with a unique username, valid email address and password. Active users on the platform, who previously actively agreed to be contacted, were recruited via a single email. Before commencing the study phase, all users had to finish three introduction levels to be familiarized with the platforms' user interface and image types. The number of correct answers in the first iteration of these levels, normalized against the mean score of the entire DermaChallenge platform user base, served as a score of experience. Users were grouped into ‘low' (n = 11), ‘medium' (n = 21) and ‘high' (n = 9) experience based on quantiles with cuts at 0.25 and 0.75 probability (R stats::quantile() function). Within the study level, users were shown batches of 10 images, randomly selected from a pool of 1,511 images, that is, the ISIC 2018 Task 3 test set, with a predefined diagnosis distribution (actinic keratosis and intraepidermal carcinoma (AKIEC): 1, basal cell cacinoma (BCC): 1, benign keratinocytic lesion (BKL): 1, dermatofibroma (DF): 1, vascular lesion (VASC): 1, melanoma (MEL): 2, melanocytic nevus (NV): 3). For each image, a user had to choose one diagnosis out of seven options, and subsequently again after assistance from our foundation model, presented as multi-class probabilities visualized as bars and numbers for each class. Readers had the flexibility to complete multiple survey rounds with different image batches at their discretion; incompletely answered batches were omitted. The study was conducted online from 20 August to 12 September 2024, during which we collected data from 41 raters. Our foundation model for decision support used a weighted random sampler strategy, following the approach from76 but excluding test-time augmentation. The model showed robust performance, achieving an 80.4% mean (macro-averaged) recall, with notably high recall rates for critical skin lesions: 87.2% for melanoma and 86.0% for BCC.

The reader study was conducted using a web-based platform developed for online dermatological assessment. A total of 37 healthcare professionals participated in the study, categorized into two groups based on specialization: a dermatology group (n = 20) comprising 9 dermatology specialists and 11 specialty trainees, and a generalist group (n = 17) including 7 GPs, 7 general medicine practitioners and 3 other healthcare professionals (nursing, clinical trial assistants) who manage skin conditions within their broader practice scope. This grouping strategy reflects the real-world clinical setting in which nondermatologist healthcare professionals routinely perform initial skin assessments. The diverse range of 128 skin conditions enabled the evaluation of diagnostic performance between dermatologically trained professionals and those with general medical training. Readers were presented with clinical images and asked to provide their assessment through a structured questionnaire. Each participant rated image quality on a 5-point scale (from ‘not at all' to ‘completely' assessable), provided a primary diagnosis through free-text entry and optionally listed two differential diagnoses ranked by likelihood. Diagnostic confidence was recorded on a 4-point scale (1, not at all confident; 2, somewhat confident; 3, confident; 4, highly confident). Following their initial assessment, readers were shown PanDerm's top 3 predicted diagnoses and given the opportunity to maintain or modify their original diagnosis and differential diagnoses, followed by a reassessment of their confidence using the same 4-point scale. The study collected 1,342 responses between 1 July and 2 October 2025. Before the evaluation, four experienced dermatologists collaboratively developed a standard ontology to systematically categorize the 128 skin conditions and facilitate expert evaluation (Extended Data Fig. 8). The evaluation process involved multiple expert assessors who independently scored diagnostic accuracy using a 4-point scale: 4, direct match with the predefined term in the ontology; 3, match within the same diagnostic category in the ontology; 2, inconsequential misdiagnosis; and 1, significant mismatch, potentially dangerous misdiagnosis. To ensure robust assessment, each case was evaluated by three assessors, with cases showing significant scoring discordance (differences between 3/4 and 1/2) reviewed in consensus meetings to establish final scores. For the top 3 accuracy evaluation, both human readers and AI assistance were evaluated based on whether the correct diagnosis appeared within their top 3 diagnostic choices.

For multi-class tasks, we primarily use a weighted F1 score, which averages class-specific F1 scores (harmonic means of precision and recall) weighted by class size. It addresses class imbalance in multi-class scenarios. For binary classification, we primarily use AUROC, measuring the model's ability to distinguish between classes across all classification thresholds. An AUROC of 1.0 indicates perfect classification, while 0.5 suggests random guessing. This metric is particularly useful for imbalanced datasets and when we need to evaluate trade-offs between true-positive and false-positive rates. For the three reader studies, we report accuracy (top 1 or top 3). In skin lesion segmentation, we use the Dice similarity coefficient and Jaccard index to assess segmentation quality. For TBP-based melanoma screening, we primarily report the sensitivity (recall) in malignant lesions, focusing on the model's ability to correctly identify malignant cases.

For skin tumor patch classification, melanoma slide classification, reader studies, metastasis prediction and skin lesion segmentation, we conduct k-fold cross-validation owing to either a relatively small sample size or following conventional practice. We compute the mean and standard deviation of performance across the folds, then calculate the standard error by dividing the standard deviation by the square root of the number of folds. The 95% CI is derived using 1.96 times the standard error. To assess statistical significance, we conduct two-sided t-tests comparing PanDerm's performance against the baseline model for each task. For the remaining datasets, we use nonparametric bootstrapping with 1,000 replicates to estimate 95% CIs for each model's performance. To compare models, we implement pairwise permutation tests, conducting 1,000 permutations per pair and recalculating performance metrics after each permutation. We derive two-sided P values to evaluate the null hypothesis that paired observations stem from identical distributions. In addition, we perform t-tests to assess the statistical significance of inter-model performance variations. Our null hypothesis posits no discernible difference between PanDerm's performance and that of its competitors. P < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.

The HAM10000 (ref. 34) dataset contains 10,015 dermoscopic images across 7 classes: actinic keratoses, basal cell carcinoma, benign keratosis, dermatofibroma, melanocytic nevi, melanoma and vascular lesions. It is stratified into 60% training, 20% validation and 20% test sets. For human–AI collaboration, we used the official dataset. All other experiments used the clean version from a previous study78, which prevents data leakage by ensuring that lesions from the same patient are not split across sets.

The BCN20000 (ref. 79) dataset comprises 12,413 dermoscopic images in 9 categories: nevus, melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, seborrheic keratosis, actinic keratosis, solar lentigo, squamous cell carcinoma, dermatofibroma and vascular lesions, including lesions in hard-to-diagnose locations. It is similarly stratified (60–20–20 split). We used the clean version of BCN20000, which, like the HAM10000, addresses data leakage issues.

The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)55 dataset is curated from the MSKCC data from the ISIC archive55, containing 8,984 dermoscopic images with melanoma and other classes.

The HIBA55 dataset is curated from the HIBA data from the ISIC archive55, containing 1,635 dermoscopic images with melanoma and other classes.

The PAD-UFES-20 (ref. 43) dataset from Brazil contains 2,298 close-up clinical images with 6 classes, including actinic keratosis, basal cell carcinoma of the skin, malignant melanoma, melanocytic nevus of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma and seborrheic keratosis.

We grouped the classes of the diverse dermatology images (DDI) dataset63 into melanoma and others. The dataset contains 647 clinical images from the United States.

Derm_D is a subset of Derm7pt (ref. 80), containing 839 dermoscopic images, and Derm_C contains 839 clinical images with melanoma and other classes.

ISIC2024 (ref. 47) is a multicenter dataset with skin lesion crops from TBP. We chose holdout data with 49,025 crop images with three institutions (FNQH Cairns, Alfred Hospital, Melanoma Institute Australia) as the evaluation dataset.

PH2 (ref. 81) is a clinical image dataset from Portugal with 200 images and 3 classes. We reorganize it to a binary melanoma detection task.

The Med-Node82 dataset contains 170 clinical images. We reorganize it to a binary melanoma detection task.

DermNet44 contains 19,559 clinical images; this dataset consists of images of 23 types of skin diseases and captures common clinical presentations including inflammatory conditions (eczema, psoriasis), infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) and neoplastic diseases.

The Fitzpatrick17K (ref. 62) dataset comprises 16,577 clinical images annotated with both dermatological diagnoses and Fitzpatrick skin types (I–VI). It encompasses 114 distinct conditions (minimum of 53 images per condition) spanning major dermatological categories: inflammatory dermatoses (psoriasis, lichen planus, various eczematous conditions), cutaneous malignancies (melanoma, morpheiform and solid-cystic variants of BCC, SCC), papulosquamous disorders (pityriasis rosea, pityriasis rubra pilaris), autoimmune conditions (lupus erythematosus, bullous diseases), benign neoplasms (seborrheic keratosis, dermatofibroma) and various other clinically significant entities (acanthosis nigricans, granuloma annulare, necrobiosis lipoidica).

The dataset is an in-house clinical dataset with 9 skin condition classes, including benign keratinocytic, malignant keratinocytic, melanocytic, inflammatory conditions and benign tumors, vascular lesion, basal cell carcinoma, malignant keratinocytic, melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma. We chose 38,476 images as our evaluation dataset.

The MMT-74 dataset (Supplementary Table 38) is a comprehensive in-house clinical collection comprising 38,476 dermatological images across 74 detailed skin condition classes, building upon and refining the broader 9-class structure of MMT-09. This structured dataset encompasses diverse dermatological conditions, including detailed classifications of basal cell carcinoma variants (nodular, pigmented, superficial and recurrent), melanocytic lesions with specific pattern recognition (such as acral patterns and various nevus types), inflammatory disorders (dermatitis, psoriasis), benign proliferations (including seborrheic keratosis variants) and vascular lesions (angiomas, telangiectasias). The dataset was specifically designed to evaluate deep learning models' performance across a diverse and clinically relevant range of skin conditions, with categories spanning inflammatory, infective, benign proliferations, melanocytic and eczema classifications.

This dataset encompasses 5,619 clinical images covering 128 dermatological conditions spanning the complete spectrum of clinical practice. The dataset provides substantial coverage of inflammatory dermatoses, ranging from common presentations (such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis) to less common entities (such as leukocytoclastic vasculitis). It includes diverse infectious diseases of bacterial, viral and fungal etiologies, as well as a comprehensive range of proliferative lesions from benign nevi to malignant melanomas. The collection also extends to appendageal disorders, physical-trauma-related changes, nail disorders and hair-loss conditions. This extensive compilation represents both frequently encountered conditions in everyday practice and challenging rare cases, providing a robust resource for clinical diagnostic support. This dataset contains 5,619 clinical images encompassing diverse dermatological conditions commonly encountered in clinical practice. The dataset provides substantial coverage of inflammatory conditions from common presentations (psoriasis, atopic dermatitis) to less common entities (leukocytoclastic vasculitis); various infectious diseases spanning bacterial, viral and fungal etiologies; and a range of proliferative lesions from benign nevi to malignant melanomas as well as appendageal disorders and physical-trauma-related changes. We used 10% of the data stratified by disease labels for benchmark evaluation. In addition, we selected 200 images stratified by disease classes for our reader study.

The skin tumor patch classification task66 consists of tissue patches of 378 histopathology WSIs from the archive of the Institute of Pathology, Heidelberg University, the MVZ for Histology, Cytology and Molecular Diagnostics Trier and the Institute for Dermatopathology Hannover for classification of 16 categories including 4 tumor types and 12 normal tissue structures. We obtained a total of 129,364 image patches of 100 × 100 μm (395 × 395) size. The dataset was stratified by label, with 55% allocated for training, 15% for validation and 30% for testing.

The melanoma slide classification task83 from the National Cancer Institute's Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium Cutaneous Melanoma (CPTAC-CM) cohort consists of histopathology WSIs for cancer detection. After selecting labeled WSIs, we obtained 302 slides (71 normal, 231 tumor). For training and evaluation, we used a fivefold cross-validation strategy with label-stratified splits to maintain class balance.

The dataset (Supplementary Table 39) consists of 179 serial dermoscopic imaging sequences from 122 patients, totaling 730 dermoscopic images. The patients were recruited from a private specialist dermatology clinic, with follow-up periods ranging from January 2007 to December 2019. The study population showed distinct characteristics between melanoma and benign groups: patients with melanoma had a mean age of 56.6 years (s.d. = 11.8) compared with 49.6 years (s.d. = 11.4) in the benign group, with slightly different gender distributions (53.9% male in melanoma versus 40.0% male in benign cases). Both melanoma and benign lesions that underwent short- or long-term SDDI at least once before biopsy were included. The dataset is well balanced, with 90 benign lesions and 89 malignant lesions. Of the 89 melanomas, 34 (38.2%) were invasive, with a mean Breslow thickness of 0.5 mm, while 55 (61.8%) were in situ. The melanoma subtypes included invasive superficial spreading melanoma (SSM) (36.0%), in situ SSM (31.4%), unspecified in situ (18.0%), lentigo maligna (12.3%) and invasive lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM) (2.2%). The benign lesions were predominantly dysplastic nevi (40.0%), followed by compound nevi (27.8%), junctional nevi (18.9%) and intradermal nevi (8.9%). Anatomically, lesions were most commonly located on the lower limb (29.2% melanoma, 26.7% benign) and back (23.5% melanoma, 25.6% benign). All lesions were monitored via digital dermoscopy, excised owing to clinical concerns and confirmed by pathological examination. The number of images per sequence varied from 1 to 12, with an average of approximately 4 images per sequence.

The SDDI1 (ref. 55) dataset is sourced from the ‘Repeated Dermoscopic Images of Melanocytic Lesions' by University Hospital Basel, available in the ISIC archive. It comprises 116 sequential lesions, each with a sequence length of 5, from 66 patients. The dataset is categorized into two classes for lesion change detection.

SDDI2 is an in-house dataset from the Medical University of Vienna. It contains 229 sequential dermoscopic images with a sequence length of 2. The dataset includes both binary change labels and more fine-grained malignant change labels. This dataset is also used for short-term lesion-change detection.

The ComBineMel dataset encompasses 680 dermoscopic images of invasive melanoma from 370 patients recruited across 10 hospital sites in multiple countries, including Australia and 5 European nations. For large melanomas, multiple images were captured to ensure comprehensive coverage of the entire lesion area. The study population is included in Supplementary Table 40. Regarding disease staging, the majority of cases were classified as stage I (70.5%), followed by stage III (16.5%), stage II (12.2%) and stage IV (0.8%). In terms of T classification, T1a was the most common (59.2%), followed by T2a (18.6%) and T4b (13.2%). Sentinel lymph node biopsy was not performed in most cases (71.6%), with 10.8% positive and 17.6% negative results among those tested. For nodal status, N1 disease was the most common (10.8%), followed by N2 (3.8%) and N3 (1.8%). Regarding metastasis status, 248 (67.0%) of cases showed no metastasis, while 66 (17.8%) presented with metastasis at the time of diagnosis. In addition, 56 (15.1%) of cases developed metastasis during the follow-up period.

The skin lesion segmentation task is evaluated using two publicly available datasets. The ISIC2018 dataset52 comprises 3,694 dermoscopic images with 2,594 images for training, 100 for validation and 1,000 for testing. We follow this official dataset split for our experiments. The HAM10000 dataset34 includes 10,015 dermoscopic images, each with corresponding binary segmentation labels. A randomized selection approach is adopted, with 64% of the images used for training, 16% for validation and the remaining 20% for testing.

This dataset comprises 3D TBP images captured using the VECTRA WB360 system (Canfield Scientific). The system uses 92 cameras to simultaneously capture cross-polarized 2D images with standardized lighting within seconds, which are then merged to create a high-fidelity 3D avatar of each patient's entire skin surface. From these 3D avatars, individual lesion tiles were exported for further analysis. Unlike stand-alone clinical photographs, TBP represents a higher-order imaging modality in which 2D tiles are systematically derived from 3D reconstructions, maintaining spatial relationships. The standardized acquisition with calibrated lighting enables the capture of the entire body surface with overlapping views, providing consistent anatomical landmarks and contextual information for comprehensive assessment, including skin phenotype patterns, lesion measurements and ‘UD' sign application. The images undergo calibration and stitching, resulting in standardized 2D tiles with consistent quality across all body regions.

This in-house dataset84 contains image tiles (693 × 693 pixels) created from 92 raw 2D photos, each representing approximately 10 cm2 of cutaneous surface. Tiles with <33% skin surface were excluded using pixel color analysis. Manual review removed out-of-focus images, tiles with multiple body sites or identifying features. The final dataset comprises 5,022 image tiles from MYM50 and HOP49 studies, labeled as low, moderate or severe photodamage risk labeled primarily by dermatology students.

This dataset, derived from the in-house MYM50 study, contains 28,227 lesion tiles annotated as nevus or nonnevus. Three expert physicians independently labeled lesions on-screen, with consensus determined by ≥2 clinicians' agreement. A senior dermatologist manually identified nevi in-clinic using a dermatoscope, serving as the gold standard for the test set. To ensure consistency, lesions under underwear, on the scalp or on foot soles were excluded, and only lesions ≥2 mm were considered. A minimum 1-month interval was maintained between on-screen and in-clinic labeling sessions.

This dataset comprises 2,038 TBP scans from 480 patients, collected from the MYM and HOP studies. The raw TBP scans include nevi images and a variety of nonrelevant images such as normal skin, scars and freckles. To focus only on nevi, we applied filtering parameters based on built-in Vectra data settings: majorAxisMM ≥ 2, deltaLBnorm ≥ 4.5, out_of_bounds_fraction ≤ 0.25, dnn_lesion_confidence ≥ 50 and nevi_confidence > 80. This process resulted in 196,933 lesion image tiles. We stratified the data by the patient for training, validation and testing: 360 patients for training (146,752 images), 40 patients for validation (19,483 images) and 80 patients for testing (30,698 images, including 28 malignant lesions). Of the total dataset, 216 images represent malignant lesions, with 40 confirmed melanoma cases.

Alongside the image tiles, Vectra provides a range of measurements for each lesion, mainly including size, color and shape. Our TBP screening model incorporates 32 such measurements: ‘A', ‘Aext', ‘B', ‘Bext', ‘C', ‘Cext', ‘H', ‘Hext', ‘L', ‘Lext', ‘areaMM2', ‘area_perim_ratio', ‘color_std_mean', ‘deltaA', ‘deltaB', ‘deltaL', ‘deltaLB', ‘deltaLBnorm', ‘dnn_lesion_confidence', ‘eccentricity', ‘location_simple', ‘majorAxisMM', ‘minorAxisMM', ‘nevi_confidence', ‘norm_border', ‘norm_color', ‘perimeterMM', ‘radial_color_std_max', ‘stdL', ‘stdLExt', ‘symm_2axis' and ‘symm_2axis_angle'.

Scripts for data collection and processing were written in Python (version 3.9.19) using the libraries Pandas (version 2.2.2), Numpy (version 1.26.4) and Pillow (version 10.3.0). For self-supervised pretraining, we used 4 × 80 GB NVIDIA H100 GPUs configured for multi-GPU single-node training using DistributedDataParallel (DDP) as implemented by Python (v.3.9.13), PyTorch (v.2.2.1, CUDA 11.8) and Torchvision (v.0.17.1). The CAE-v2 code is used as the codebase to develop our foundation model, which can be found in its official repository (https://github.com/Atten4Vis/CAE). For downstream task evaluation, all experiments were conducted on 4 × 49 GB NVIDIA 6000 Ada GPUs. We used Python (v.3.9.19), PyTorch (v.2.2.2, CUDA 11.8) and Torchvision (v.0.17.2) for fine-tuning tasks, and Python (v.3.10.14), PyTorch (v.2.2.2, CUDA 11.8) and Torchvision (v.0.17.2) for linear probing tasks. We used Scikit-learn (v1.2.1) for logistic regression in the linear probing setting. Implementation of other comparative pretrained models was modified based on the official configuration in their respective repositories: MAE (https://github.com/facebookresearch/mae), SL_ImageNet (https://huggingface.co/timm/vit_large_patch16_224.orig_in21k), DINOv2 (https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2), SwAVDerm (https://github.com/shenyue-98/SwAVDerm), autoSMIM (https://github.com/Wzhjerry/autoSMIM), BATFormer (https://github.com/xianlin7/BATFormer), MedSAM (https://github.com/bowang-lab/MedSAM), ResNet50 (https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.resnet50.html), MILAN (https://github.com/zejiangh/MILAN), CLIP (https://github.com/openai/CLIP), BiomedCLIP (https://huggingface.co/microsoft/BiomedCLIP-PubMedBERT_256-vit_base_patch16_224) and MONET (https://github.com/suinleelab/MONET/tree/main).

Access to in-house datasets is restricted due to patient privacy considerations. These include MMT for dermoscopic and clinical image pretraining and downstream multi-skin condition classification, NSSI for sequential dermoscopic image pretraining, ACEMID_path for dermatopathology pretraining, Edu1 and Edu2 for clinical image pretraining, SDDI2 for lesion change detection, SDDI_Alfred for reader study 1 (early melanoma detection) and the TBP data from MYM and HOP studies for all TBP-based pretraining and evaluation. Researchers interested in accessing these datasets should direct their requests to the corresponding author. All requests will receive a response within 2 weeks of submission. Requests will be evaluated according to institutional and departmental policies to ensure compliance with intellectual property rights and patient privacy obligations. The availability of these data may be subject to additional restrictions or requirements.

We have made the encoder code and weights available for downstream task applications. They are available via GitHub at https://github.com/SiyuanYan1/PanDerm. We have documented all experiments in detail in Methods to enable independent replication. To facilitate the broader use of our model, we have provided tutorial Jupyter notebooks and downstream evaluation code suitable for a wide scientific audience. These resources have been made available to ensure transparency and to promote further research in this field.

The relationship between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump may have publicly erupted this week, but the billionaire's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is currently on a recruiting spree, WIRED has learned.

DOGE appears to be reaching out specifically to technologists who have previously worked for the government, even some of those who left as part of the administration's campaign to drastically shrink the federal workforce, according to two sources who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity to protect their privacy. One candidate was told that even though they recently left the government under the Deferred Resignation Program (DRP), they might still be eligible for a position at DOGE.

DOGE is looking to hire tech workers in development, operations, software, and product for two-year terms, a different recruit tells WIRED.

Potential recruits are being told, according to sources, that the pay range remains on the higher end of the government pay scale, between $120,000 and $195,000 per year. Applicants are, like WIRED previously reported, still being put through a multi-step process that includes a screening call, a take-home technical assessment, and two follow-up interviews.

DOGE applicants are required to complete a take-home project where they create a tool to analyze federal regulations in the Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR). For the permanent USDS applicants, they're asked to submit their code to a private file-sharing platform called Kiteworks. Applicants are asked to publicly upload their code to GitHub.

An email to candidates viewed by WIRED notes that successful applicants may end up working on projects like “leveraging AI to improve medical services for veterans,” “streamlining federal aid applications from Americans who experience natural disasters,” and “improving the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).” (WIRED previously spoke to a DOGE applicant who reported similar information.)

The executive order Trump signed that created DOGE placed the group inside what was formerly called the US Digital Service, a small Obama-era organization of tech talent where workers serve two to three year terms in government before heading back to the private sector. The executive order renamed USDS the US DOGE Service and established a “temporary DOGE organization” as well. Both bodies are currently hiring, sources tell WIRED.

The US DOGE Service and DOGE “are basically the same thing now,” one source tells WIRED.

Since Trump came into office and the otherwise small team of technologists at USDS became the staging ground for the Musk-led digital coup, the USDS has lost the vast majority of its staff, and has struggled to bring in new talent, WIRED previously reported.

Meanwhile, many members of the original DOGE strikeforce, which included young, inexperienced engineers who accessed some of the most sensitive data at government agencies, are now being converted into full-time government employees within federal agencies. Last week, Luke Farritor and Edward Coristine, who has gone by “Big Balls” online and previously worked for a telecommunications firm known for hiring former blackhat hackers were brought on full-time at the General Services Administration (GSA).

Sources also tell WIRED that Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla engineer and one of the lead DOGE affiliates who spearheaded the group's operations at the GSA, is considering revamping the Presidential Innovation Fellows program, which brings technologists into government and places them within different agencies to improve government services. The program has been unable to bring in new talent this year because of the government-wide hiring freeze. Shedd is the director of GSA's Technology and Transformation Services (TTS), a subagency that provides technical expertise to agencies across government.

“Thomas Shedd and his bosses created a problem by collapsing and getting rid of all of their tech talent, and now they have these projects they want to prosecute to implement new capabilities and that requires tech talent,” says one GSA tech worker.

At some point in this goop-y era, mushrooms went from pizza topping and psychedelic trips to wellness panacea. You've seen the adaptogenic lattes and the “high-quality” mushroom-extracted tinctures endorsed by influencers who smile like they've never experienced a bad hair day. Now, inevitably, functional fungi have been gummified, promising to boost your immune system, clear brain fog, and sharpen your cognitive function.

The appeal of functional mushroom gummies is obvious. They taste more like candy and your childhood than a dietary supplement. But while shrooms have legitimate benefits, mushroom supplements don't come without asterisks. I talked to the experts, reviewed the labels, and taste-tested my weight in fruity fungus chewables to find the ones that are more than just expensive candy. We liked Om's rigorous sourcing for the Master Blend Mushroom Gummies ($30) and thought Plant People's WonderDay Gummies ($33) tasted the best, but read on for more of the best mushroom gummies, according to science and a very overstimulated digestive system.

For more wellness recommendations, check out our guides to the Best Mushroom Coffee, Best Natural Sleep Aids, and Best Air Purifiers.

If you're looking to explore the world of functional fungi, Om sets the standard with its careful sourcing and rigorous transparency. Unlike many mushroom supplements that focus on extracts or isolated compounds, Om's Master Blend utilizes the entire mushroom: mycelium, primordia, and fruiting body. This means you're consuming the full range of bioactive compounds, including beta-glucans, polyphenols, and prebiotic fibers.

Each gummy is powered by a blend of 10 functional species (lion's mane, cordyceps, reishi, etc.) grown indoors at the company's cGMP-certified, BRCGS AA-rated facility in San Diego. The mushrooms are cultivated using solid-state fermentation, a process in which the mycelium feeds on gluten-free organic oats and transforms them into bioavailable nutrients.

Every step of the process is traceable. Every ingredient is verified. Every batch is tested. The gummies are certified organic, non-GMO, gluten-free, and kosher, making them suitable for nearly any diet or lifestyle.

Plant People's WonderDay Mushroom Gummies are sugar-free but taste like candy. Made with a blend of eight functional mushrooms, including royal sun, lion's mane, turkey tail, and others, they somehow avoid an earthy flavor. Actually, they're raspberry-flavored. They're vegan, non-GMO, and allergen-free. The mushrooms are grown in the United States, primarily in the Rocky Mountains, using regenerative practices. Plant People is a B Corp and Climate Neutral Certified company.

According to Plant People, the effects (stress relief, better mood, consistent energy levels) build over the first month of consumption. I tried them for five days, which isn't enough time to say if they “worked,” but it was enough to make me crave more.

Bonus: Across the board, Plant People's functional mushroom gummies are easy to take, with no bitter aftertaste. Other options include WonderSleep (elderberry-flavored), WonderCalm (peach-flavored), WonderBurn (mango), and WonderBeauty, a watermelon gummy featuring tremella mushroom, biotin, keratin, and marine collagen for skin, hair, and nail support. Plant People offers trial packs, allowing you to sample without committing to a full bag.

Slumber

Slumber

Slumber's Rest & Renew Mushroom Sleep Gummies are made with reishi fruiting bodies, chamomile, passionflower, magnesium citrate, and a hint of melatonin. I tried them for a week, but they didn't significantly improve my sleep, which has been consistently disrupted since the invention of TikTok. However, I can see these being helpful for someone who doesn't struggle to sleep but simply desires a more restful slumber.

The aftertaste is unpleasant. Slumber gummy products often have this issue, leading me to believe that it's not the mushrooms causing it but rather the overall formulation. I have to chase it down with water, and I don't think I'm being dramatic.

Sunday Scaries

Sunday Scaries

Sunday Scaries Functional Mushroom Gummies + Nootropics deliver a noticeable jolt. Thirty minutes after consumption, I felt that unmistakable caffeine buzz. Flavor-wise, the orange is OK. I don't hate it, but I don't love it.

Every batch comes with third-party certifications verifying purity, potency, and safety. The ingredients are sourced from KND Labs in Denver, an FDA-registered, cGMP-certified facility.

Alice Mushrooms

Alice Mushrooms

Mushroom chocolate aims to aid in nighttime relaxation while also regulating sleep cycles long-term. Alice Chocolates uses reishi, a substance that comes from fruiting mushrooms, along with chamomile, L-theanine, magnesium, and zinc. The idea is that the reishi will help regulate and promote healthy sleep patterns over time, while the added supplements will aid in helping sleepiness with more immediacy. The chocolates are vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, and kosher, and also come in Brainstorm, to aid in energy and focus, and Happy Ending, for arousal and pleasure. The chocolate was tasty—it wasn't overly sweet and had a nice bitterness like a robust dark chocolate should. The first few nights of testing, I woke up around 4 am, but after I upped the dose to two chocolate squares, I felt more relaxed before bed, fell asleep in a little over an hour, and stayed asleep all night. —Molly Higgins

8/10

In a sea of nearly identical fitness trackers, Whoop stands apart. Since it started in 2012, the company has understood that the hardware was secondary to software. For a pricey monthly membership, you get access to a (theoretically) never-ending series of new features in the Whoop app, and the company throws in the small, screenless sensor for free.

This was once a pretty good bargain, but for the past several years, Whoop hasn't done much. In 2023, the company released its OpenAI-powered personalized fitness service, Whoop Coach. As with most other AI-enabled fitness services, you had to think really hard about how to frame your questions to get useful advice. I didn't find it particularly helpful.

This year, the company finally released an updated Whoop that comes with a bevy of new features that make it a much more versatile tracker for people who don't post their gains every day. Most notably, it has a proprietary algorithm for blood pressure tracking. I've been testing the new Whoop MG for a few weeks now, and it reminded me why people like this tracker so much.

If you're not familiar with a Whoop tracker, it's a small wearable with photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors to measure heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV); accelerometers to measure movement, strain, and activity; and skin temperature sensors to capture variations during sleep or recovery. The new Whoop units are smaller and purportedly more power-efficient than the last one, although I'm not getting anywhere near the claimed 14-plus days of battery life. In 21 days, I've had to charge it twice.

Whoop MG

Rating: 8/10

It doesn't have onboard GPS. It's not super-annoying, given that, you know, it doesn't even have a screen, so I'm not exactly using the Whoop to clock my pace on a run. But you do have to use GPS on your phone to unlock certain features within the Whoop app, like a more accurate VO2 max. (Just toggle “Track Route” in the app when starting to log a run.) You can also insert the Whoop into Whoop Body garments.

Whoop sent the new MG training bra ($59) and training shorts ($54), which captured my data while I was running and rowing, but if you're a returning Whoop customer, you do need the new Whoop Body clothes because the MG is smaller than the last iteration, the Whoop 4.0.

It's also important to note that Whoop changed its membership structure. You used to pay a blanket $30 per month membership fee for everything Whoop had to offer, but now features are paywalled behind a tiered subscription plan. Whoop One ($199/year) gets you the regular Whoop 5.0, which is the upgrade from the Whoop 4.0, Whoop Coach, and sleep, strain, and recovery tracking. Whoop Peak ($239/year) gets you the Whoop 5.0 with the new Healthspan and Pace of Aging features, and Whoop Life ($359/year) gets you the new Whoop MG, which unlocks the new cardiac features like ECGs, heart screeners, blood pressure monitoring, and AFib detection.

Paywalling features sucks. But I must point out that at $359 per year, the highest tier costs exactly what Whoop subscribers were paying before the change, which was $30/month. That's not exactly cheap, especially compared to an Oura subscription at $6 per month, but Oura doesn't include a ring in the subscription, either.

The most significant difference between Whoop and almost every fitness tracker is a proprietary algorithm called Strain. It's a measure of the stress on your body, on a scale from 1 to 21 based on the Borg rating of perceived exertion. Strain takes into account your previous day's recovery, so the Strain score you earn day to day, even from the same activities, will be different. It's also not linear, so getting your Strain score from 16 to 17 is much harder than getting your score from 4 to 5.

Most fitness trackers are meant to encourage you to, you know, get moving and gamify any movement at all. In contrast, Whoop gives you zero brownie points for getting up and moving every hour. One Friday, I walked my kids to and from school, walked to lunch, walked my dog, biked to my kids' school, set up yard games, walked around playing yard games, then biked home. It was a 17,000-step day. Guess how much Strain I accumulated? Not nearly enough, says Whoop. A mere 10.1 Strain score. It was not optimal and did not put me on the path to future gains. Not even rock climbing for 1.5 hours in the gym gave me a noticeable Strain increase.

It can be frustrating, especially if you're someone who is used to thinking of themselves as pretty active. Thankfully, Whoop has introduced many more features that make the Whoop more useful for regular fit people and not people trying to win the Masters age group in a road race. The most significant new features are Healthspan, Pace of Aging, and a slew of cardiac features only available with the Whoop MG and the Whoop Life membership. It's the first tracker that made the distinction that while I'm currently younger than my chronological age, my Pace of Aging is sadly accelerated due to my poor sleep habits and intermittent strength training.

The cardiac features are anchored by the blood pressure measurement. A few important factors to note: The blood pressure measurements are done via a proprietary algorithm that uses your heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood flow patterns to estimate your systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The Whoop does not take blood pressure measurements from the wrist. The feature is still in beta, is not yet FDA-cleared, and requires calibration with a separate blood pressure monitor.

I used a Withings BPM Vision to calibrate the Whoop, and my manual measurements did not find anomalies. Right now, I think blood pressure monitoring on the Whoop is useful as a canary in a coal mine. If you have hypertension and were hoping that a Whoop meant you didn't have to take your blood pressure daily, you will need a separate blood pressure cuff.

I compared the stats measured on the Whoop to my Oura ring and found that the sleep stats were astoundingly similar—the amount of sleep measured, for example, differed by only a minute or two. The Whoop now counts steps, which it did not do before, but the steps are hilariously inaccurate when compared to the Garmin Forerunner 970, either swinging wildly too many or too few. GPS tracking helps the Garmin to be more accurate, and Whoop is continuously updating the algorithm, but I would take step tracking with a grain of salt for now.

Whoop Coach has seen significant improvements since I last tried it several years ago. Instead of just sitting there, a blank space waiting to be filled with your personal health neuroses, it now gives you a Daily Outlook with the weather, a few select health insights, and some suggested activities for the day. It also offers some personalized prompts. For me, these weren't always helpful—yes, I'm trying to improve my sleep consistency by going to bed at the same time, but it doesn't always work out that way. But at least now, Whoop Coach offers a starting point.

Finally, the Whoop has a haptic alarm that you're supposed to turn off by tapping the top of the device. This did not work for me—I tapped and tapped, to no avail. I turned this off and used my phone's alarm, like usual.

If you're considering the Whoop, you should ball out and get the Whoop MG with the Whoop Life membership. Even years after it debuted, it's still a niche tracker, but still unique. You never have to take it off or look at a screen or worry about notifications. You can layer it with bracelets or stick it in your bra or underwear. The Whoop Life membership has health insights that no other tracker has right now, particularly when it comes to cardiac health, and Whoop Life costs the same as a regular Whoop membership has for years.

I like being able to check, you know, what time it is with a Garmin or how fast I'm running with a tracker that has a screen, but if I were a lifter, I could see the appeal. Now, off to try and find an activity that will give me a decent amount of Strain.

The extremely public and increasingly unhinged breakup of Elon Musk and president Donald Trump has caused chaos in DC, forced Silicon Valley executives to pick a side, and wiped more than $150 billion off Tesla's market cap.

But in the conspiracy theory-addicted corners of the internet, the feud between Musk and Trump is nothing more than a fake, planned distraction. After Musk posted on X about Trump's alleged relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the multimillionaire charged with sex trafficking of minors—“@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files,” Musk wrote.“That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!”—conspiracy theorists were convinced this was all a plan to trick Democrats into calling for the Epstein files to be published.

Rather than admit that two of their favorite people have fallen out and are making increasingly dire threats against each other, QAnon folks prefer to believe that this is all part of a scheme cooked up by the pair in recent months.

“Smooth-brained folks who haven't been paying attention and don't understand that kayfabe is in play, actually believe Trump and Musk are fighting,” AwakenedOutlaw, an anonymous X account that promotes far-right talking points with over 300,000 followers, wrote on Thursday evening. Kayfabe is a decades-old term used in the world of pro wrestling to describe how wrestlers maintain the illusion that fights are real and that their hatred of their opponents extends outside the ring.

For the influencers and grifters dedicated to the QAnon conspiracy world, kayfabe has become a crucial tool to maintain a veil of credibility when reality seems to jar with conspiracy theories. By claiming that events which don't fit their predictions are fake influencers in the community can ensure their followers stay dedicated to the movement.

And on Thursday evening, within minutes of the Trump-Musk feud kicking off, influencers very quickly began calling it all fake or part of a game of “5D chess.”

“It's a wonderful game of 5D chess! Get the popcorn out, and watch the left go wild,” wrote one member of the Telegram channel run by prominent election denier David Clements.

Liz Crokin, a Pizzagate conspiracy theorist who met Trump in Mar-a-Lago in 2022, pushed the conspiracy theory even further. In a post on X that has been viewed 440,000 times, she claims that “it would not surprise me if the Deep State created fake evidence falsely implicating Trump. If this is the case, their scheme will fail and backfire. So grab your popcorn and watch the media and Democrats falsely report Trump is a pedophile and a sex trafficker—this boomerang will be epic! 5D chess at its finest, baby—checkmate!”

While Musk is mentioned in a couple of Q drops—the anonymous posts on fringe message boards followers believe were written by government insiders—he was not a major figure within the movement until last year. Thanks to his role in Trump's reelection and his decision to allow all QAnon accounts back onto X, Musk is highly lauded within the community. The centibillionaire even posted a video with QAnon references to his 200 million X followers on the eve of the 2024 election.

A prominent QAnon promoter who goes by MJ Truth suggested that this spat was dreamt up prior to Trump's inauguration when Musk was spending significant time at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

“Elon Musk basically lived at Mar-A-Lago for a few months,” he wrote on his Telegram channel. “Lots of time to plan things out. As much as they are trying to sell this argument to everyone that this is real, it isn't. Only anons understand why…It's KAYFAB [sic] on a MAGAnamonous level.”

When Politico reported late Thursday about a potential detente between Musk and Trump, MJ Truth wrote on Telegram: “Told ya, Kayfabe.”

A similar situation occurred in 2018 when former attorney general Jeff Session was attacked and then fired by Trump during his first term. Because someone who claimed they were “Q” and created the QAnon movement had previously written “TRUST SESSIONS,” influencers quickly said Trump's attacks were fake and just part of his ongoing battle to expose the deep state.

Outside of QAnon, conspiracy theorists were struggling to come to terms with MAGA's biggest figures having such a public falling out. “This World stands on the brink of Total Destruction,” Alex Jones, the conspiracist who called the Sandy Hook school shootings a hoax and was sued for defamation and found liable by default, wrote on X, adding that he would need to investigate the allegations about Trump and the Epstein files further before picking a side.

Meanwhile, Jack Posobiec, a prominent Pizzagate promoter who recently traveled to Ukraine as a member of the press with a Trump cabinet member, put the whole thing down to men being men.

“Some of y'all can't handle 2 high agency males going at it and it really shows,” Posobiec wrote on X. “This is direct communication (phallocentric) vs indirect communication (gynocentric).”

In some comments, people didn't seem to really understand what this all meant.

“What is this being used as a distraction from??” one user wrote on Telegram, while another suggested: “Elon most likely wrote it anyway.” A third added: “I wonder if that leads more into the auto pen and Biden doubles?”

Finally, someone else just said what everyone else was clearly thinking: “I'm so confused.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Silicon Valley Is Starting to Pick Sides in Musk and Trump's Breakup","https://www.wired.com/story/musk-trump-feud-venture-capitalists-pick-sides/","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 00:54:03 GMT","

Silicon Valley investors and tech executives who loudly supported both US president Donald Trump and Elon Musk may now be forced to pick sides as the president of the United States and the world's richest man go through an extremely messy public breakup.

Their high-profile bromance imploded this week when Musk began using his social media platform X to denounce Trump's signature policy initiative, known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which experts say would cut taxes, reduce health care benefits for poor people, and dramatically increase funding for immigration enforcement, while also adding trillions of dollars to the federal deficit.

Musk has called the bill “a disgusting abomination” and claimed Congress is “making America bankrupt.” Trump responded on Thursday by suggesting he might cancel contracts Musk's companies have with the federal government. During a press conference the same day, Trump floated the idea that Musk was angry about the bill because it also eliminates subsidies for electric vehicles that benefit Tesla.

Trump gave Musk—a private citizen—unprecedented access to the White House and federal government by appointing him to run the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Their alliance was emblematic of a new era in Washington, where top Silicon Valley figures used their massive online platforms to support a candidate they believed would be good for business.

The feud is putting pressure on some of Musk's closest associates from the tech industry, including Trump's AI and crypto czar David Sacks, Marc Andreessen, and other investors, to choose whether to align themselves with the Tesla CEO or continue supporting the president. So far, some people appear to be trying to walk a fine line between backing Musk while not outwardly criticizing the White House.

“Elon leaves it all on the field, and he puts what he believes in ahead of himself,” Shaun Maguire, a partner at Sequoia Capital who says he donated $300,000 to Trump last year, tweeted on Thursday. “How can you not be inspired by that? (Even if you disagree with him).”

Brad Gerstner, the founder of Altimeter Capital, took a different tack when asked by a Bloomberg reporter at a tech conference on Wednesday night about Musk's criticism of Trump's bill. “I'm a big fan of Elon,” Gerstner said, “and I also believe, and have fought for 30 years, over the fact that we need some sort of balanced budget amendment in the country.” He added that it was “unconscionable that we live a higher standard of living today by borrowing on a credit card that's going to come due” and is hoping the country finds its way to a “four- or five-year plan laid out by this administration.”

In one of a series of rapid-fire posts on social media criticizing Trump and his administration on Thursday, Musk asked his more than 220 million followers whether it was time to “create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle.” In a reply, venture capitalist and Y Combinator president Garry Tan wrote that “kitchen table abundance” rather than “a bunch of grifting BS and virtue signaling and culture wars” should be prioritized. Aaron Levie, CEO of the cloud storage company Box, also voiced his support for Musk's idea.

Some of Trump's high-profile backers from Silicon Valley stayed mostly quiet during the Trump-Musk flare-up on Thursday or tried to turn attention to other topics, including Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya, two tech industry veterans who are also hosts of the enormously popular All In podcast, which has featured friendly interviews with Trump and some of his cabinet appointees in recent months.

As of Thursday afternoon, Palihapitya was posting on X about crypto, while Sacks shared a recent New York Times op-ed about AI policy. But their fellow podcast hosts, David Friedberg and Jason Calacanis, posted what appeared to be cryptic references to the drama.

“​China just won,” Friedberg wrote on social media. “There are no true friends in politics—only mutual interests,” Calacanis said in a separate message. He followed up with a meme portraying Musk as rapper Kendrick Lamar, who was recently involved in a tense feud with fellow musician Drake.

“Can't wait to see the All In podcast guys political beliefs disappear overnight,” Dar Sleeper, a former Tesla product manager, quipped on X.

Adam Kovacevich, a former Google executive and the current CEO of the tech industry trade group Chamber of Progress, says he thinks the current Musk-Trump riff doesn't get at the heart of what most tech business leaders are really concerned about with the current administration.

“I don't want to overstate the rupture, but the vast majority of people in the tech industry aren't aligned with anybody right now,” Kovacevich says. “Some might appreciate what Trump has done, calling off SEC lawsuits against crypto and calling off the Biden order on AI, but at the same time there's still a lot of angst about tariffs. That's the single biggest issue for tech right now.”

A former Democratic operative who now works at a tech investment firm says that, while the Trump-Musk fight will indeed force some people to choose a side, it won't be a straightforward decision for many of them. “This isn't 2012—there are all these different strands making up the Trump alliance now,” says the operative, who asked to remain anonymous because they weren't authorized by their employer to speak to the media.

“The basic issue is that Elon was the gateway for people going from the traditionally Democratic tech industry towards Trump and the Republican party. And now the question is, will Elon be the gateway for the tech industry to come back to the left?” the source says.

Two sources who spoke to WIRED say that some investors and technologists might not be quick to embrace Musk because they are disappointed by how he handled DOGE. “A lot of people put tremendous faith in the idea that DOGE could shake up the government,” the former Democratic operative says, but the reality is that Washington is a different world from tech. “It's the least worst outcome for many, not the best outcome for a few.”

As the sun began to set outside the White House on Thursday, Trump and Musk were still trading barbs—and there's little sign their battle will end anytime soon. In fact, this may be only the beginning. As right-leaning tech investor Mike Solana put it on X: “And so, as foretold, the great tech right/populist right-wing schism of 2025 begins.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Apple's WWDC 2025: How to Watch and What to Expect","https://www.wired.com/story/apple-wwdc-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect/","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference is typically a highly-polished showcase of the company's software updates and new features, and Apple is expected to follow the well-trodden formula this year. While past events have sometimes included hardware announcements, like the Vision Pro and Apple Silicon, WWDC 2025 might be a software-only show this time. (Looking for that new iPhone? You won't see one on Monday; Apple's iPhone launch events are typically held in September.)

The biggest announcements at WWDC 2025 are potentially a new naming convention and refreshed look for iOS, according to preshow reporting from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Other highlights may include a new app for gamers and the company opening up its foundational AI models to third-party developers.

Apple's keynote for WWDC 2025 is going to be livestreamed on Monday, June 9, starting at 10 am Pacific, 1 pm Eastern, and 6 pm British Summer Time. It's available to watch directly on Apple's website or through the company's YouTube channel. Are you curious how WIRED editors and reporters are reacting to the announcements from Apple? Open up another tab, and follow along with our live blog coverage during the event.

Just after the keynote, WIRED subscribers will be able to dig deeper with me and Michael Calore, WIRED's director of consumer tech and culture, in a follow-up livestream where we'll answer your most burning questions about Apple and the future of its software.

New iOS Naming Convention: Significant changes to Apple's operating system will likely be the biggest news to come from this developer conference. Rather than transitioning from iOS 18 to iOS 19, the company is expected to leap forward to iOS 26. This new naming convention would continue to follow the upcoming year (27, 28, 29) for future iterations of the operating system.

Everything Will Look Different: Also, Apple's software is anticipated to undergo a major aesthetic shift, with the visual changes staying consistent across the interfaces of Apple's many devices. The look might be loosely based on the Vision Pro's operating system, though it's unclear exactly how a design tailored for mixed reality could translate to other products such as smartphones and watches.

Another Gaming App: Apple may give social gaming another whirl. The company could spin down its current Game Center, launched in 2010, and try again with a new, preinstalled gaming app on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV devices. (While I do have Apple Arcade, I'm basically using it right now as a monthly subscription to mobile Balatro.)

Foundational Models Open Up: Third-party software experts may soon get access to a development kit that enables the creation of AI features within iPhone apps. This would be done using Apple's large language models. When Apple Intelligence features initially launched, the notification summaries were criticized by users, as well as publications like the BBC, when erroneous summaries appeared on iPhone lock screens.

New iPhones, or Really Any Hardware: The company's refreshed smartphones and other gadgets will likely be announced at an event later this year. Nothing on new Apple devices has leaked before this conference, so hardware surprises are not very probable.

Next-Gen Siri: Any day-of surprises are likely to be software-related. Still, a fabulous, new Siri is unlikely to be one of them. A generative AI redo of Apple's voice assistant could be underway at the company, but it would need more development and testing before release.

A Bunch of AI Features for Consumers: The AI announcements will likely be related mostly to developer-focused tools. Other than a rumored AI-powered tracker designed to help extend an iPhone's battery life, WWDC 2025 is not expected to be as focused on in-house AI tools for consumers as it was last year.

Of all the words in the dictionary, Sarah Franklin says “balance” is perhaps her favorite — especially when it comes to companies embracing AI.

Franklin leads the Jack Altman-founded employee performance software company Lattice, which is now worth $3 billion. Both onstage at SXSW London and in conversation with TechCrunch, she spoke a lot about balance — the opportunities in finding it, and the risks of not having it during this AI revolution. 

“We put people first,” Franklin told TechCrunch, referring to Lattice, which has started to adopt more AI and automation features. 

Although some companies are touting AI as a way to replace massive numbers of workers, some tech leaders are speaking more openly about the importance of striking a balance at their companies: retaining human employees while augmenting them with AI assistants and “agents.” At SXSW London, Franklin said that looking to fully replace human workers might seem like a good idea in the short term for cost-saving reasons, but such a move might not actually be attractive to customers.

“It's important to ask yourself, ‘Are you building for the success of the AI first [or are] you building for the success of the people and your customers first?” she said, adding that trust is the most important currency any founder or startup company has, and that building trust with consumers is paramount. “It's good to have efficiency, but you don't want to trade out trust.” 

Franklin also stressed the importance of transparency, accountability, and responsibility when it comes to AI. Leaders need to be transparent with employees about what the AI is doing, the AI must be narrowly applied to a particular goal so people understand how it works, and humans must ultimately be held accountable for what the AI impacts. 

“Otherwise, we are then in service of the AI versus the AI being in service of us,” Franklin continued. 

In an interview with TechCrunch after her SXSW appearance, Franklin said Lattice has built an AI HR agent that gives proactive insights and assists employees in one-on-one meetings. The company also has a platform where Lattice clients can create their own custom agents for their businesses. 

Franklin was adamant that humans must have oversight of any AI technology implemented by a company. “It's a way to just have the regular checks and balances that we're used to in our workforce,” she told TechCrunch.

She thinks the victors in this AI moment in history will be the ones who learn how to put people first. According to Franklin, it's one of the most important guardrails that a company can have on AI. 

“We all have a responsibility to make sure that we're doing this for the people of society,” Franklin said. “Human connection cannot be replaced, and the winners are going to be the companies that understand that.”

AMD is continuing its acquisition spree.

Semiconductor giant AMD acqui-hired the team behind Untether AI, a startup that develops AI inference chips, as originally reported by CRN. Untether claims that their chips are faster and more energy-efficient than their rivals. The terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

Toronto-based Untether was founded in 2018 and has raised more than $150 million in venture capital from firms including Intel Capital, Radical Ventures, and Tracker Capital Management, among others.

Untether released an AI chip in October meant to power physical AI applications in machines, including cars and agricultural devices.

Earlier this week, AMD announced it had acquired AI software optimization platform Brium.

TechCrunch has reached out to AMD for more information.

Representatives Yvette Clarke (D-NY) and Beth Van Duyne (R-TX) launched the bipartisan Congressional Creators Caucus on Thursday, which aims to support the creator economy.

Though it once seemed like a pipe dream to make a living on the internet, this industry has become a reality — Oxford Economics estimates that YouTube's ecosystem alone powered over 390,000 full-time equivalent jobs in 2022, while Goldman Sachs estimates that the creator economy could be worth half a trillion dollars by 2027.

But the U.S. government doesn't have much regulatory oversight or understanding of the creator economy as it stands, leaving creator businesses in a bind.

“As digital content creators' online presence continues to reach billions globally, Congress must work to ensure resources and protections are in place to support their success in this new era of start-ups,” Representative Clarke said in a statement.

Matthew Patrick (MatPat) and Stephanie Patrick, who founded the popular digital production studio Theorist Media, spoke at a press event for the launch of the caucus. The husband and wife duo have spent over a year lobbying on Capitol Hill to advocate for creators' needs.

“We're trying to educate lawmakers about what the creator economy is, and that it's an actual job and that we are actually small businesses, and as a result, there are certain tax codes and things that apply to small businesses,” Matthew Patrick (the creator known as MatPat) told TechCrunch last year. “Even when you talk to accountants, they're like, well, are you though? Because there's not a clear indicator on tax forms — like, what is a creator business?”

The Patricks have also pushed to point out that the creator economy isn't an industry confined to the coasts, in entertainment industry hotspots like New York City and Los Angeles — rather, it's an industry that needs support across the nation. Theorist Media and MrBeast, the most popular YouTubers in the world, are both based in North Carolina. Meanwhile, John and Hank Green have used their success on YouTube to launch businesses like the educational media company Complexly, which has headquarters in Indiana and Montana.

Patreon and YouTube, two of the most vital companies that help creator businesses operate, have affirmed their support for the new caucus.

As a Patreon blog post explains, creators often build businesses without the same protections that more traditional businesses have, like insurance, disaster relief, and access to loans. Even startups like Karat Financial have sprung up to fill in some of these gaps, providing business credit cards and banking to creators who are often denied these services because legacy financial institutions don't understand their businesses.

“Too often, creators are overlooked in economic policy discussions—despite being small business owners, employers, and cultural tastemakers in every congressional district,” explained Courtney Duffy, Patreon's Head of External Affairs and Strategic Engagement, in a statement. “The bipartisan Congressional Creators Caucus is a crucial step toward recognizing their impact and ensuring they have a seat at the table in shaping the policies that affect their livelihoods.”

A U.S. court denied Apple a stay on a ruling that requires the company to stop charging developers for payments made outside the App Store through links in apps.

This means in the U.S., Apple will no longer be able to charge developers a fee when customers click on a link within their app that takes them outside the App Store for payment, resulting in a potential loss of revenue to the company.

“Apple ‘bears the burden of showing that the circumstances justify an exercise of [our] discretion,'” the court said in a filing. “After reviewing the relevant factors, we are not persuaded that a stay is appropriate,” it added.

Epic Games' head Tim Sweeney applauded the court's ruling and said, “The long national nightmare of Apple tax is ended,” in a post on X.

Apple's stay is denied by the 9th Circuit Court. The long national nightmare of the Apple tax is ended.May next week's WWDC be the Apple-led celebration of freedom that developers and users have long deserved. pic.twitter.com/f0A3IAVKNC

Apple called the denial of stay disappointing in a statement.

“We are disappointed with the decision not to stay the district court's order, and we'll continue to argue our case during the appeals process. As we've said before, we strongly disagree with the district court's opinion. Our goal is to ensure the App Store remains an incredible opportunity for developers and a safe and trusted experience for our users,” an Apple spokesperson said.

In April, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled in favor of Epic Games, saying that Apple was in “willful violation” of a 2021 injunction that barred the company from forcing anticompetitive pricing. This essentially means that Apple must change the App Store rules and allow developers to freely link to their website for purchasing digital goods.

In response, Apple filed an emergency motion last month seeking a stay on the court's ruling. The company also filed an appeal against the ruling around the same time.Last year, Apple began allowing other apps to link out and use non-Apple payment mechanisms, but it still took a 27% fee and added what critics called “scare screens.” With the new ruling, both practices will be eliminated.

Large companies are already making changes to their apps, with Spotify and Amazon publishing new updates that let users pay for their subscriptions and purchases outside the App Store. 

With the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) slotted for next week, this is a big blow to Apple. Earlier this week, the company published a report saying that it generated $1.3 trillion in billings and sales in 2024. It added 90% of those sales didn't generate commission revenue for Apple.

The story has been updated with Apple's comment.

Fitness equipment maker Peloton‘s CEO Peter Stern has said the company is exploring ways to expand its customer base by making its products available for use in gyms and launching a peer-to-peer marketplace for used equipment.

Speaking at Bloomberg Tech Summit on Thursday, Stern said Peloton plans to distribute its machines to commercial gyms via its subsidiary Precor, a gym equipment supplier, and is working to add Peloton workouts to compatible Precor equipment.

The company this week also set out to grab a share of the market for used Peloton equipment, launching a peer-to-peer marketplace called Repowered. “Historically, [secondhand sales have] taken place, for example, on Facebook marketplace, and that's absolutely fine for people who want to do that, but it means that you need to transact with a stranger on both ends, and potentially have that stranger come into your home. What we're trying to do is streamline that and deliver a more premium experience for those secondhand customers,” he said.

Stern said the company aims to use AI to improve personalization for its members. “I want to find ways to scale coaching by creating individualized programs for each of our members so that they can get the right class from the right instructor that's personalized for them,” he said.

That said, there's another less known feature that bundles help out with when used with `git clone --bundle-uri` The client can specify a location to a bundle, or the server can send the client the bundle location in the clone results and the client can fetch the bundle, unpack it, and then update the delta via the git server, so it's a lot lighter weight on the server for cloning large repos, and a ton faster for the client for initial clones.

Realtalk: They should rewrite this post's headline to be in a positive tense instead of leading with a negative word. I'm glad I read the post, because it is a cool and good fix, but I saw “Decreasing […] repo backup” and my first thought was that it was an announcement of some service downgrade like some sort of cost-cutting measure.

Noting that, was Bell Labs really much more successful than a more typical research institution like MIT or NASA?


reply



It is debatable whether NASA has made any great leaps of discovery or engineering over the last 3 decades or so. The Apollo missions were spectacularly successful (even accounting for setbacks) and we have a great deal of insight as to why they worked so well.I have my own thoughts about why it doesn't work today (in the West, at least) but I'll keep them to myself because they are not organized and are likely to start a political debate or three in any case.

In the UK at least, researchers have many options for research fellowships of 3-5 years, paid, many with total academic freedom to do whatever you likeMy partner just got accepted to one after spending 3 months applying to 5 fellowships — an 8% ratio of application:research time.In an Oxford or Cambridge college, you're working, eating and (for younger fellows) living in college with many other smart people.

Perhaps in theory. But surely you're not going to get the next fellowship (or other academic role) unless you have shown some demonstrable output at the end of this one? That's still at least some level of pressure to try something safer but incremental rather than risky but potentially groundbreaking.

The most successful folks tend to mix talent and hard work with a bit of luck in terms of early gold striking to gain a quick boost of credibility that helps them draw other people into their fold (eg, grad students in a big lab) who can handle a lot of the metric maxxing to free up some (still not enough) time for more ambitious thinking.

The UK seems considerably better (much less bureaucracy and fewer hours of teaching) but still, you probably need to do reports and stuff on top of the grant applications.

The corporate tax rate was much higher during the 1950s and 1960s [0], which would seem to encourage companies to invest in research to grow their business instead of giving the government the money.I don't have a strong opinion on this, but it seems like it could be a factor.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_tax_in_the_United_St...

Here, there are no product managers, barely any formal management, and a remarkably flat structure. Most of the day-to-day work revolves around filing patents, writing papers, speaking at conferences, and building rapid prototypes that push the boundaries of what's technically possible, often years ahead of commercialization. In some ways, it feels like stepping into a time capsule of what R&D used to be: curiosity-driven, deeply technical, and untethered from the usual metrics, as opposed to today's modern R&D miasma aimed only at sand-bagging products/results to nab VC funding and then cash out.But the catch: our funding rises and falls with the cable industry. When times are good, we explore bleeding-edge ideas in areas like low-latency transport, advanced Wi-Fi features like Wi-Fi sensing, quantum-key distribution over fiber, and next-gen access networks. When times are tight (like now), there's a sharper focus on short-term, directly applicable work — sometimes even jumping in to help operators troubleshoot real-world deployment issues. It creates this strange duality where one week you're working on a speculative 10-year-out idea, and the next you're neck-deep in production firmware because a partner needs help _today_.It's a fascinating place to work, but it does raise an interesting question: can long-term innovation really thrive when it's so tightly coupled to a volatile and risk-averse industry? Bell Labs had Ma Bell's monopoly cash to float moonshots. We've got a much leaner model, and the priorities shift accordingly. Sure, we've got Comcast in our pockets, but our R&D charter states that no one member can dominate our funding or priorities: we're split among hundreds of members and vendors, and they all seem coupled to one another economically, so if the industry takes a dip, so do we. I'd be curious how others in applied R&D spaces manage that tension between visionary research and near-term deliverables.

I think we massively underestimate just how much one simple fact, the absurd explosion of housing costs, have contributed to this. Take that away and just about everyone would have this kind of freedom. Look at just the gaming industry for example. Practically any great game from the past decade you can name was made in Europe or Japan; places that have kept these costs low relative to the rest of the West. When you don't have everyone terrified about how they're going to make rent next month, it frees up literally everything else. You can take these random walks and experiment when the cost of your existence doesn't necessitate bringing in huge amounts of income.

Lately I have been using atuin for this.  I have some gripes about interface defaults, and how the interactive search for history wipes out most of what was on my terminal view and causes a big ""wtf was I doing again?"" moment when it changes the terminal so much, but the tradeoff of shared history is very very much worth it for me.


reply



I use bash within tmux heavily, and got irked that a command I run in one shell session is not immediately available as a history item in other concurrent shell sessions. So I wrote a history plugin based on bash-preexec to track everything to two files: a per-directory history file, and a global history file.I have a bash function which does history selection for me, by popping an fzf selector to look at the directory-specific history file. A keybinding within fzf allows me to switch to looking at the global history file instead.Boring commands such as “cd”, “pushd”, and a few others don't get logged. The log entries are in json format and include basic metadata; directory, timestamp, and pid.Within the fzf history picker, another keybinding allows me to edit whichever file I'm actively using. So if I fumble a few times to construct a command, then when I get it right I just pop into the selector, edit the relevant file, and remove the lines I don't want to misfire on again.I'm sure this is basically what atuin does; now that I'm at the spot where directories are the unit of history relevant history, maybe I should give that tool another look.One really interesting upside of all of this is that I now tend to make “activity-specific” directories in my repos. For example, I have a “.deploy” directory at the git root of most of my projects. There are no files within that directory; but my tool creates ~/.bash.d/history/home/belden/github/company/project/.deploy.json which contains the history of ~/github/company/project/.deploy/Empty directories are invisible to git, but for me the directory “has” content: the log of how I need to deploy this service or that service.It's a weird way to use my shell, and just sprung out of the initial grief: I shouldn't have to exit a shell session to have its history become available.

Your hardware might be fast enough that it's negligible, but several years ago (maybe 2018-19ish?) I noticed my shell startup was getting sluggish and traced a large fraction of it back to the time bash took to load many lines into history.I still like keeping it all, so I wrote something to dump it into a database as I go but then truncate working histories to something shorter (500, I think).

You can optionally sync your history to a server in encrypted form to keep a shared history across hosts. The server is extremely easy to self host.As discussed in TFA, it's easy to filter or scrub junk like `cd ~/Desktop` so it doesn't pollute your history. You can also fuzzy search and toggle between commands run in your current session, commands run on your current host, commands run in your CWD, and commands run on all hosts.It's my single favorite piece of dev tooling, and has made my job + life far smoother and easier. Highly recommend.https://atuin.sh/

> Why save vim /etc/rc.conf when sudo vim /etc/rc.conf is what I meant 100% of the time?Good point, but AFAIK all shells search history by recency by default. Whether I search with Fish's up-arrow, or with Atuin's ^r, the first result will be the match I executed most recently. In this case, that means I'd have to type `sudo vim /etc/rc.conf` correctly one time and then that's the first version of the command I'll see next time I look for it. And if it's something I do often enough for it to matter, but still manage to screw it up frequently, I'll turn it into an alias or function.This is the kind of busywork that feels like an ADHD tarpit to me. No. I absolutely do not need to optimize my shell history, lest I end up with a beautiful, tiny history file that's free from the detritus that would have come from me spending that time actually doing my job.

reply



Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying there are no differences between ethnicities, just that those differences are based on ancestry not race. People of a specific ""race"" don't share the same ancestry all the time, some times they have more in common with a different ""race"" than their own. Race as we know it today is a means of classifying humans that came about at a time when colonial expansion was booming. Classifying people based on their outward appearance was all too convenient. It's like someone learning how to code who found out there are thousands of programming languages and categorized them using terms like ""curly brace language"",""lots of parenthesis language"",""indentation oriented language"". It's lazy and childish. But once you learn more about the languages you should abandon the old ways of classifying things.


reply



That's it. It's a classification system, a taxonomy, a social construction, a coarse categorization (all these things). But it's a bad one that only loosely correlates with a small handful of phenotypes. There isn't zero correlation which is why I disagree, as a matter of precision, with people who say race doesn't exist. The quality of a given taxonomy exists on a spectrum and race is a pretty damn bad one when you consider how inaccurately it separates the phenotypes it claims to care about, and how many genotypes/phenotypes (the vast majority) it fails to separate at all beyond a coin flip.

For example, a study indicating that ""black people in the US are X% more likely to have {some condition}"" is useful, even if ""black person in the US"" doesn't tell much about an individual's ancestry. That's because health conditions are heavily influenced by environmental factors, and someone's race impacts the environmental factors they're exposed to.This does get complicated, and requires digging deep into the data. Top-level statistics don't indicate root cause, which still needs to be researched. But top-level statistics can indicate that there's a problem that needs to be worked on, which is why medical studies tracking race are still useful.

""Traditional races"" as you call them have changed over time and space, and we are only in this predicament because we lump different ethnicities together today. 150 years ago people could tell the difference between someone of West African or East African descent. And Southern Italians, Irish vs Western Europeans vs Germans... etc.It's harder now because a) there has been a lot more mixing since then; and b) socioculturally we consolidated many of those ethnicities

Non-Africans split from Africa relatively late in human genetic history.   So A and B's divergence point(s) can readily be quite a bit earlier than C's.   So, as you pointed out, C is likely more closely related one of A or B.   Let's say B.The big difference between B & C is that B is much more likely to incorporate genes from other early branches than C is.   Therefore B is likely further away genetically from A than C is.

This might sound like nitpicking, but most black people in the US have significant European ancestry and the admixture can vary wildly even for people with similar skin tones. Our naive view of ""race"" is not always backed by genetic reality.

It's pretty low quality information.   If you're taking a genetic test you want something that returns susceptibility to sickle cell amenia, cystic fibrosis, tay-sachs, et cetera.    Race is a very low quality signal that is used when you lack something better, like a genetic test.

All of a sudden, people have the ability to determine if distant ancestors came from a different continent. Even if it's just 1 or 2% or even a trace amount, they're checking off boxes identifying themselves as multiracial.For the 2020 census, it resulted in a 276% increase in the number of people self-identifying with more than one racial group. This is far more than could be explained by immigration or children born to parents from different backgrounds since 2010.This NPR article (https://www.npr.org/2021/08/28/1030139666/2020-census-result...) explains the dynamic:Its findings suggest adults 50 and up are most likely to self-identify as multiracial on surveys after receiving a report about the potential roots of their family tree based on a DNA analysis of their saliva. The study of more than 100,000 adults registered as potential bone marrow donors in the U.S. also found that DNA test takers were especially likely to identify with three or more racial groups. ...""Native American was the one identity people really wanted to have and really wanted to prove,"" Roth says, adding that she has also found that some people stopped claiming Native American identity after the results of a test did not show any genetic ancestry.You can imagine the problem when self-reported racial identities could really cloud the waters for determining a suitable bone marrow donor or other health application.

This is not necessarily wrong though. In many cases I've seen where children of grandparents from a particular region showing up on those products as having low percentage heritage from those areas.If your grandmother was born in China and is - for all intents and purposes - clearly Chinese, yet you show up with 3% Chinese DNA on these products, does that mean you can't identify as having Chinese in your family background? Who determines where this line is drawn?

Race was a crude approximation and better techniques are available today. There is a push to use a wider variety of reference genomes which makes sense especially now that that computers are more powerful. There seems to be an assumption by others here that going from an unsophisticated crude approximation to a sophisticated one will somehow validate their other assumption that 'race is only skin deep'. I am not as optimistic.

That said, there is probably a good argument for breaking out at least South Asian from Asian as a distinct top-level racial category, in the same way that MENA recently was. (But note that all of the top-level categories also have more detailed breakdowns available, and recent revisions have also moved to require the more detailed options to collected in a wider range of circumstances.)> The only reason Hispanic is one is because the conquistadors were really, really persistent, murderous, and shameless eh?Mostly, the opposite: that the successors to the conquistadors were less genocidal and more assimilationist than their British and British-descended North American counterparts.

The only reason these groups are included this way is because of lobbying power (for and against) and $$ and privileges related to being in or out of various categories.From an ontological perspective, your argument is BS looking at the actual distributions and ground truth of these groups.

There are hispanic creoles, native american creoles, german creoles, italian creoles, so forth and so on. Because to be a Louisiana creole isn't to rely on any racial marker at all. It just signifies that your ancestors lived here at a particular time.So if someone says that they're Cajun, not creole, they're lying to you. ALL cajuns, without exception, are creole.And most people who claim to be Cajun are either not Cajun at all or they've mistaken their surname for being Cajun.  Like a guy who told me I was wrong about a food item and he knew better because he's a Cajun, being a Champagne from Golden Meadow.Only problem is that Champagne isn't a cajun surname. The Champagne family came over directly from France.You might have seen Isaac Toups on TV hawking a cookbook. The Toups surname is actually German (originally spelled Dubs but the French authorities did their thing), and they landed in the US in 1718-19 in Biloxi, MS.And so on, and so on...I think that some ""cajuns"" would be more willing to call themselves creole if they knew that in addition to the native americans, the other group that saved their asses when they came to the territory were the German creoles. Those people had it far, far harsher than the Acadian disapora ever did. When they got to the territory, they were not allowed to use beasts of burden for a full decade. This means that when they were dropped off and told to go farm rice (which none of them had ever done before), they had to till their fields and deliver their product to New Orleans from the River Parishes, up to 60 miles away without horses. By the time the Cajuns got here, there were plenty of horses for working the land and other livestock that you were legally allowed to eat.Anyway, that's just one little speck of a much larger ethnic pie.

I assume this refers to figure 7 of the study [1].

It's almost like our perceived identity is just a user interface, and the genetic code is the raw assembly language underneath. It makes me wonder, how much of our cultural narrative is shaped by these historical ""coding errors"" or, perhaps, deliberate obfuscations? And what happens when more and more people start running these genetic ""debuggers"" on their own personal history? Are we headed for a significant ""reboot"" of how we understand race and identity in society? Just food for thought.

I don't think the problem is the science, it's the non-scientific conclusions.

This is also nazi garbage. IQ isn't a real thing.

I made pretty crystal clear it doesn't mean anything beyond that.

I am only bothered by instances of racism where you violate the individual liberties of others.  ex Nazis I don't really care the Germans hated Jews, I do care they put them in camps and executed them.  Pre-emptively slapping them would violate their individual liberties, walking across the street infringes on no one, and indeed if I tried to control the right to people to freely travel based on thought-police it would be far more dystopic than any potential racism.

Startup Xona Space Systems hopes to provide an unspoofable alternative to increasingly threatened GPS.

Later this month, an inconspicuous 150-kilogram satellite is set to launch into space aboard the SpaceX Transporter 14 mission. Once in orbit, it will test super-accurate next-generation satnav technology designed to make up for the shortcomings of the US Global Positioning System (GPS). 

The satellite is the first of a planned constellation called Pulsar, which is being developed by California-based Xona Space Systems. The company ultimately plans to have a constellation of 258 satellites in low Earth orbit. Although these satellites will operate much like those used to create GPS, they will orbit about 12,000 miles closer to Earth's surface, beaming down a much stronger signal that's more accurate—and harder to jam. 

“Just because of this shorter distance, we will put down signals that will be approximately a hundred times stronger than the GPS signal,” says Tyler Reid, chief technology officer and cofounder of Xona. “That means the reach of jammers will be much smaller against our system, but we will also be able to reach deeper into indoor locations, penetrating through multiple walls.”

The first GPS system went live in 1993. In the decades since, it has become one of the foundational technologies that the world depends on. The precise positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) signals beamed by its  satellites underpin much more than Google Maps in your phone. They guide drill heads at offshore oil rigs, time-stamp financial transactions, and help sync power grids all over the world.

But despite the system's indispensable nature, the GPS signal is easily suppressed or disrupted by everything from space weather to 5G cell towers to phone-size jammers worth a few tens of dollars. The problem has been whispered about among experts for years, but it has really come to the fore in the last three years, since Russia invaded Ukraine. The boom in drone warfare that came to characterize that war also triggered a race to develop technology for thwarting drone attacks by jamming the GPS signals they need to navigate—or spoofing the signal, creating convincing but fake positioning data. 

The crucial problem is one of distance: The GPS constellation, which consists of 24 satellites plus a handful of spares, orbits 12,550 miles (20,200 kilometers) above Earth, in a region known as medium Earth orbit. By the time their signals get all the way down to ground-based receivers, they are so faint that they can easily be overridden by jammers.

Other existing Global Navigation Satellite System constellations, such as Europe's Galileo, Russia's GLONASS, and China's Beidou, have similar architectures and experience the same problems.

But when Reid and cofounder Brian Manning founded Xona Space Systems in 2019, they didn't think about jamming and spoofing. Their goal was to make autonomous driving ready for prime time. 

Dozens of robocars from Uber and Waymo were already cruising American freeways at that time, equipped with expensive suites of sensors like high-resolution cameras and lidar. The engineers figured a more precise satellite navigation system could reduce the need for those sensors, making it possible to create a safe autonomous vehicle affordable enough to go mainstream. One day, cars might even be able to share their positioning data with one another, Reid says. But they knew that GPS was nowhere near accurate enough to keep self-driving cars within the lane lines and away from other objects on the road. That is especially true in densely built-up urban environments that provide many chances for signals to bounce off walls, creating errors.

“GPS has the superpower of being a ubiquitous system that works the same anywhere in the world,” Reid says. “But it's a system that was designed primarily to support military missions, virtually to enable them to drop five bombs in the same bowl. But this meter-level accuracy is not enough to guide machines where they need to go and share that physical space with humans safely.”

A sophisticated new electronic warfare system is being used at the world's busiest port. But is it sand thieves or the Chinese state behind it?

Reid and Manning began to think about how to build a space-based PNT system that would do what GPS does but better, with accuracy of three inches (10 centimeters) or less and ironclad reliability in all sorts of challenging conditions.

The easiest way to do that is to bring the satellites closer to Earth so that data reaches receivers in real time without inaccuracy-causing delays. The stronger signal of satellites in low Earth orbit is more resistant to disruptions of all sorts. 

When GPS was conceived, none of that was possible. Constellations in low Earth orbit—altitudes up to 1,200 miles (2,000 km)—require hundreds of satellites to provide constant coverage over the entire globe. For a long time, space technology was too bulky and expensive to make such large constellations viable. Over the past decade, however, smaller electronics and lower launch costs have changed the equation.

“In 2019, when we started, the ecosystem of low Earth orbit was really exploding,” Reid says. “We could see things like Starlink, OneWeb, and other constellations take off.”

In the few years since Xona launched, concerns about GPS's vulnerability have begun to grow amid rising geopolitical tensions. As a result, finding a reliable replacement has become a matter of strategic importance. 

In Ukraine especially, GPS jamming and spoofing have become so common that prized US precision munitions such as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System became effectively blind. Makers of first-person-view drones, which came to symbolize the war, had to refocus on AI-driven autonomous navigation to keep those drones in the game. 

Since Russia's invasion, Serhii “Flash” Beskrestnov has become an influential, if sometimes controversial, force—sharing expert advice and intel on the ever-evolving technology that's taken over the skies. His work may determine the future of Ukraine, and wars far beyond it.

The problem quickly spilled beyond Ukraine. Countries bordering Russia, such as Finland and Estonia, complained that the increasing prevalence of GPS jamming and spoofing was affecting commercial flights and ships in the region.

But Clémence Poirier, a space security researcher at ETH Zurich, says that the problem of GPS disruption isn't limited to the vicinity of war zones.

“Basic jammers are very cheap and super easily accessible to everyone online,” Poirier says. “Even with the simplest ones, which can be the size of your phone, you can disrupt GPS signals in [an] area of a hundred or more meters.”

In 2013, a truck driver using such a device to conceal his location from his boss accidently disrupted GPS signals around the Newark airport in New Jersey. In 2022, the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport reported a 24-hour GPS outage, which prompted a temporary closure of one of its runways. The source of the interference was never identified. That same year, Denver International Airport experienced a 33-hour GPS disruption. 

“Xona is a promising solution to enhance the resilience of GPS-dependent critical infrastructures and mitigate the threat of GPS jamming and spoofing,” Poirier says. But, she adds, there is no “magic wand,” and a “variety of different approaches will be needed” to solve the problem.

The European Space Agency's ACES mission could ultimately pave the way for a global network of atomic clocks that make these measurements far more accurate.

And indeed, Xona is not the only company hoping to provide a backup for the indispensable yet increasingly vulnerable GPS. Companies such as Anello Photonics, based in Santa Clara, California, and Sydney-based Advanced Navigation are testing terrestrial solutions: inertial navigation devices that are small and affordable enough for use beyond high-end military tech. These systems rely on gyroscopes and accelerometers to deduce a vehicle's position from its own motions. 

When integrated into PNT receivers, these technologies can help detect GPS spoofing and take over for the duration of the interference. Inertial navigation has been around for decades, but recent advances in photonic technologies and microelectromechanical systems have brought it into the mainstream.

The French aerospace and defense conglomerate Safran is developing a system that distributes PNT data via  optical-fiber networks, which form the backbone of the global internet infrastructure. But the allure of space remains strong: The ability to reach any place at any time is what turned GPS from an obscure military system into a piece of taken-for-granted infrastructure that most people today can hardly live without.

And Xona could have some space-based competition. Virginia-based TrustPoint is currently raising funds to build its own low-Earth-orbit PNT constellation, and some have proposed that signals from SpaceX's Starlink could be repurposed to provide PNT services as well.

Xona hopes to secure its spot in the market by designing its signal to be compatible with that of GPS, allowing manufacturers of GPS receivers to easily slot the new constellation into existing tech. 

Although it will take at least until 2030 for the entire constellation to be up and running, Reid says Xona's system will provide a valuable addition to the existing GPS infrastructure as soon as 16 of its satellites are in orbit. 

The upcoming launch comes three years after a demonstration mission known as Huginn tested the basics of the technology. The new satellite, called Pulsar-0, will be used to see how well the system can resist jamming or spoofing.

Xona plans to launch an additional four spacecraft next year and hopes to have most of the constellation deployed by 2030. 

 

A nuclear explosion might eventually be Earth's only way to protect itself from a dangerous asteroid. But preparing for that without launching nukes into space means getting creative.

The European Space Agency's ACES mission could ultimately pave the way for a global network of atomic clocks that make these measurements far more accurate.

The Biomass mission will use a long-forbidden part of the radio spectrum to see how much carbon forests capture.

As more drones begin flying, a traffic management system developed at NASA aims to keep the airspace safe.

President Donald Trump and billionaire oligarch Elon Musk are fighting. Like, fighting fighting. And social media is enjoying the drama in the only way it knows how: By sharing memes.

In case you were somehow in a remote cave without internet access recently, here's the recap before we get to the chuckles: Musk had a going-away ceremony at the White House last Friday and earlier this week started to get more bold criticizing the budget bill passed by Republicans in the U.S. House. It was weird, but not as weird as it was about to get in just a few short days.

Trump addressed the criticism when he was asked about Musk's plea to “KILL THE BILL,” during a press conference Thursday morning. But Trump seemed to escalate things into more personal territory after Musk had been pretty good at just criticizing the Republican bill without calling the president names. Trump mocked Musk's mysterious black eye and said he was “very disappointed” in the billionaire, suggesting that perhaps he now had “Trump Derangement Syndrome.”

That set off Musk, who went nuclear on X, saying that Trump was named in the Jeffrey Epstein files and that's why they haven't been released by the U.S. Department of Justice. Musk also shared a post about how Trump should be impeached and JD Vance should become president. Trump shot back on Truth Social that maybe he should kill all the subsidies for Musk's companies and cancel his lucrative government contracts. Musk responded by saying that SpaceX would “begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately,” before later backing off that threat.

It was quite a thing to watch play out on each man's respective social media network and it's not even over yet. Musk owns X, of course, and Trump owns Truth Social, making their dispute odd in a very 21st-century way. Others participated in the debate as well, with Steve Bannon calling for Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act in order to seize SpaceX and deport Musk from the country. Musk wrote that Bannon was a “retard.”

The memes started flowing immediately and they're still going. There are jokes about Musk being deported, riffs about the billionaire trying to overthrow the federal government, and jokes about JD Vance being caught in the middle of it all. There are also plenty of zingers about Jeffrey Epstein.

Below, we've compiled some of our favorite memes we've seen circulating. But given the size of the internet, we surely missed some things. If we missed your favorite we're sure you'll let us know in the comments.

Nintendo originally billed Virtual Game Cards as the Switch and Switch 2's new means of managing the games, making the process of loading digital titles as simple as slotting in your physical Game Cards from one console to the next. In practice, Virtual Game Cards are one of the more restrictive examples of DRM we've experienced. Not only does it mandate you have a single copy of a game at any time, but you can also only have one instance of local save data on one system. Virtual Game Cards will also restrict you from playing Switch 2 games if you don't have your original Switch nearby.

Those with an original Switch have the option to do a system transfer to the Switch 2 on startup. The process also turns all your digital games into Virtual Game Cards. If you want to play your old games on the original Switch, you have to “eject” the card from the Switch 2 and “load” it on the original Switch. Your save data kept on Nintendo's cloud servers should remain tied to your Nintendo Account, but getting those titles from one system to the other requires both consoles to be in the room at the same time, at least for the first time you set things up.

When we happy few on the Gizmodo consumer tech team received our Switch 2 unit, we weren't considering just how messy this process could get if you didn't think to bring your original Switch. For review, Nintendo granted us codes for Mario Kart World, Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, and a subscription to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. We loaded two of our own profiles onto the Switch but tied those games and services to one account. After spending close to four hours setting up the Switch 2—downloading the big initial system update file and then downloading Mario Kart World off Nintendo's slammed servers—we loaded up the game only to be met with a pop-up window telling us we would need to transfer game cards onto the Switch 2 from the account owner's original Switch.

So we waited 4 hours for the Switch 2 to download Mario Kart World and now it's telling us that I need to have my original Switch on hand in order to play it. Anyone know if unlinking my Nintendo account through the web will mess up my OG Switch? pic.twitter.com/s9DbdLh5tf

— Ray Wong (@raywongy) June 5, 2025



After getting to this screen, the only two options we were left with were bringing the Switch 2 near the original Switch or remotely transferring the data from Nintendo's 8-year-old handheld through a browser. This option is meant for people with missing or damaged Switch units, but it's the only way to move forward if you don't have immediate access to your older handheld. Doing so may not brick the original Switch, but it would mean your system would be factory reset and you'd need to reinstate the user account on that device.

Virtual Game Cards have been available to the original Switch family for close to a month, and Nintendo fans already had their share of complaints, but the Switch 2 is throwing these DRM issues into stark relief. When transferring save data from the original Switch to the Switch 2, Nintendo deletes the data on the older console. Unless your files are backed up in cloud saves, you cannot simply jump from one system to another without downloading the save data first. This data transfer can go awry if you don't carefully read any on-screen prompts, as Gizmodo's Senior Editor of Consumer Tech, Raymond Wong, experienced when moving his Mario Kart 8: Deluxe game save to the new handheld. He said he accidentally overrode the transferred game save with a new, no-progress one that was saved in the cloud. It seems the console took the new cloud save as the one dedicated to the Switch 2, effectively deleting hundreds of hours of effort and vehicle unlocks from either system. As Wong voiced on X: why is a game save deleted from a Switch instead of simply copied over to another Switch?

The game save is really gone… I'm heartbroken. Just heartbroken 8 years of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe progress gone in seconds because Nintendo thinks it's smart to delete the game save off the original Switch when transferring it to the Switch 2. WHY is game save deleted and not just… https://t.co/2zxHKTRyGc

— Ray Wong (@raywongy) June 6, 2025



Virtual Game Cards don't just hang up the process of playing games on a Switch 2. It means playing games across any of your Switch systems becomes a time-consuming, restrictive hassle. For example, Wong transferred several game saves for newly minted Virtual Game Cards from his Switch to his Switch 2, but in order to play those digital games on his Switch with his progress, he'd need to transfer the game save back from his Switch 2. This can be both annoying and confusing.

Ok this is obnoxious. Apparently I can't play SMM2 like I always have because my Switch Lite is in the other room and powered down. Virtual game cards = 👎 pic.twitter.com/CfSRBZHvi4

— Mario Mike (@mariomykol) June 3, 2025



The reason Nintendo invented Virtual Game Cards was to make sure nobody had more than one copy of a game tied to any one system. Rather than keeping all your games accessible from any compatible device, like on Steam, Nintendo's digital cards are a kind of digital rights management software that restricts you from sharing your old console with a friend so he can play your library.

If you want to share games with your friends' systems, you can go through the process of temporarily transferring a game you own to their account, so long as they're in your “Family Group.” You have to do this over local wireless, and the game loan times out after two weeks. It's as if Blockbuster came back and started offering game rentals again, except you're doing it through your cousin's Switch 2. Nintendo's obsession with mandating every Switch owner only have a single copy of a game has only entrenched the decline of ownership in gaming. Your save data isn't yours. Your games aren't yours.

          Maybe ordering stuff online isn't the best way to buy after all.
        


          Even if GameStop stapled your Switch 2, remain calm and avoid paying $700 for a new console.
        


          Beyond patches to upgrade frame rates and resolution, you'll be able to use your OG Switch to play games alongside the Switch 2.

If you've recently searched for the Samsung Galaxy S25+ 512GB on Amazon, you might have come across something peculiar: the price is not visible. Rather it states “price hidden” until you put it in your cart. This is because of a very special trade agreement with Samsung: The manufacturer is wanting to keep price drops like this a secret – especially as it was released just a few months ago.

On Amazon, the Galaxy S25+ 512GB is on sale at its lowest point to date for a limited time only: The 512GB model can be purchased for $869 which is 22% off the original list price of $1119. It's obviously also a lot cheaper than if you get it from the official Samsung's store. Make sure you grab yours before it runs out of stock!

See at Amazon

Launched at the start of 2025, the Galaxy S25+ is a more powerful phone than the regular S25 with extra features to match. Both phones have the same basics: unlocked Android, smart AI cameras, and Samsung's latest ProScaler display. But the S25+ adds more upgrades, which makes the higher price so much worthwhile. On top of that, with the current discount, le S25+ is more affordable than the standard S25.

If you're looking for differences, the Galaxy S25 has a smaller 6.2-inch FHD+ display and starts with 128GB or 256GB of storage while the S25+ offers a larger 6.7-inch QHD+ screen and storage options of 256GB or 512GB (which is the one on sale right now). The S25+ also benefits from a higher pixel density, which makes images and text appear sharper.

Beyond display and storage, the Galaxy S25+ stands out with a bigger battery (4,900mAh compared to the S25's 4,000mAh) for longer battery life for heavy users. The S25+ also supports ultra-wideband connectivity which is not available on the standard Galaxy S25 and enables features like precise device tracking and secure digital car keys.

The best part of this Amazon deal is that the Galaxy S25+ 512GB now costs less than many standard S25 models, thanks to Amazon's limited-time sale. It's hard to find a better price for a top phone with all the newest features. The S25+ is unlocked, so you can use it with any carrier, and it comes with a one-year warranty for extra peace of mind.

Just keep in mind that you will need to add it to your cart to see the real price: Samsung is not allowing Amazon to disclose the full discount of the price in public.

For students and those who live on a small budget, shelling out $1,000 (or even $2,000) for a MacBook is an out-of-reach dream. Fortunately, this year's market offers a great alternative without having you compromise on performance or features: The Lenovo IdeaPad 15.6″ Touchscreen FHD Laptop, which was released this year, is currently on Amazon for a price so cheap it's not thought to be true.

For a record 70% discount, the 15.6-inch portable computer (16GB RAM, 512GB storage) is on sale for $549, down from its regular price of $1,849. This isn't a sale, it's a clearance and Amazon seems to be clearing out its stock with a deal that makes this Windows 11 Pro S laptop one of the best deals going.

See at Amazon







The Lenovo IdeaPad in question is a touchscreen 15.6-inch machine, so it's perfect for work and play. Its Full HD (1920×1080) IPS display offers an anti-glare, clear view at 300 nits brightness which makes it easy to see comfortably in a bright room or outdoors. The inclusion of a responsive touchscreen is the icing on the cake and makes easy navigation and instant availability of apps and features possible.

The RX 9060 XT is now available to buy. Here's where you can pick one up if you want one in your gaming rig. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AMD's RX 9060 XT launches today, starting at $299 for the 8GB model and $349 for the 16GB version. AMD has positioned the RX 9060 XT to fend off the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti (especially the 8GB variant) at both MSRP levels. The new GPU will vie for a spot in our list of best graphics cards once our RX 9060 XT review is out.

The RX 9060 XT is AMD's latest RX 9000-series GPU, boasting the same RDNA 4 architecture as the RX 9070 series. The GPU is quite literally an RX 9070 XT cut in half, sporting 32 CUs, 2,048 shader cores, and a 128-bit memory interface. AMD is hitting the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti's weak points by offering its 16GB variant at a lower price than the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB and re-introducing a full x16 PCIe configuration to the RX 9060 XT, giving it a performance edge (particularly the 8GB model) against its Blackwell competitors in older systems where PCIe 4.0 and 5.0 support may not be available.

However, just like the RTX 5060 and the 8GB version of the RTX 5060 Ti, AMD has received heavy criticism for offering an 8GB version of the RX 9060 XT. Before launch, Frank Azor famously stated on X that ""The Majority of gamers are still playing at 1080p and have no use for more than 8GB of memory,"" even though some AAA games are already consuming more than 8GB of video memory at 1080p with ultra graphics settings. Worse, AMD neglected to give any reviewers the 8GB model of the RX 9060 XT for testing, forcing them only to test the 16GB model.

Third-party reviewer testing shows the RX 9060 XT 16GB performing 10-20% better than the RTX 5060 on average, depending on the resolution. Naturally, you'll need to do in-depth research on the types of games and resolution that you prefer before pulling the trigger.

If you do opt for the 9060 XT, we've put a list of all partner cards below that you'll be able to buy from US-based retailers:

AMD is looking for people to help it change the AI game.

AMD has announced that it has just acquired Toronto-based AI chip company Untether AI. This isn't the usual corporate acquisition, though, where the bigger firm completely buys the smaller one. Instead, AMD only hired the entire engineering team of Untether, leaving everything else behind. Because of this, its speedAI AI inference processor and imAIgine SDK will no longer be supplied and supported, according to Untether AI's announcement.

“AMD has entered into a strategic agreement to acquire a talented team of AI hardware and software engineers from Untether AI,” AMD said in a statement to CRN. “The transaction brings a world-class team of engineers to AMD, focusing on advancing the company's AI compiler and kernel development capabilities as well as enhancing our digital and SoC design, design verification, and product integration capabilities. We are excited to welcome the team's unique expertise to AMD.”

Untether AI specializes in building AI chips specifically designed for AI inference. While GPUs like Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra or AMD's Instinct MI350 excel at training AI models, speedAI performs better in inferencing and is far more energy efficient than these power-hungry GPUs. They achieve that by placing the processors right next to the memory, reducing latency and power consumption.

It's unclear how many clients Untether AI has and how they will be affected by this change, especially as AMD did not purchase Untether AI's assets. This meant that companies that bought the latter's products were left holding the bag.

At the same time, this massive hiring is a sign that AMD is expanding its capabilities to challenge Nvidia in other AI-related fields, not just the raw computing horsepower of AI GPUs. Just one day before this announcement, Team Red also announced its acquisition of Brium, a startup that focuses on AI inference optimization.

These deals point to the company focusing on the next major step in AI development — inferencing. Justin Kinsey, President of semiconductor recruiting firm SBT Industries, said in a LinkedIn post, “AMD's acquisition of Untether's engineering group is proof that the GPU vendors know model training is over, and that a decline in GPU revenue is around the corner.” Although this is a bold prediction, Kinsey says that this has been an emerging pattern in the past six months.

As the AI power bill keeps increasing every year, companies will likely soon look for alternatives that are far more efficient. The current AI GPUs that require hundreds of watts are highly suitable for training, but they consume too much power for AI inference. If AMD can deliver a specialized chip just for this application, it could potentially challenge Nvidia's dominance, especially as the AI industry continues to mature.

So, AMD does not ramp its RDNA 4 GPUs? 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Update 6/6/2025 9:00 am ET: Jon Peddie has kindly provided us with comments regarding AMD's GPU business underperformance in Q1 2025. He believes that the sources of AMD's decline in GPU shipments lie in the company's failure to accurately predict demand for its GPU products six to nine months in advance, as well as the necessity to balance its TSMC allocations between Zen CPUs and Radeon GPUs. Read the exact comments below.

AMD's desktop GPU market share, based on sales into the market, has dropped to a historic low in the latest report from Jon Peddie Research, despite the company's launch of new products during the quarter. Discrete GPU shipments for desktop PCs increased significantly both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in Q1 2025 and totaled 9.2 million units. However, as both AMD and Nvidia rolled out their new-generation graphics cards in the first quarter, Nvidia managed to sell millions of its new GeForce RTX 50-series GPUs and capture its highest market share, while AMD struggled to sell even 750,000 add-in-boards, which is why its share dropped to a historical low.



Nvidia now commands around 92% of the desktop discrete GPU market, while AMD's share declined to approximately 8%, the company's lowest share ever.

The industry shipped 9.2 million standalone graphics processing units for desktop PCs during the first quarter, up 8.5% compared to the prior quarter and by 5.3% on an annual basis. In terms of market share dynamics, Nvidia was the only major vendor to expand its position, gaining 8.5%. AMD's share declined by 7.3%, while Intel's share saw a smaller contraction of 1.2%. 



AMD's GPU shipments totaled approximately 740,000 to 750,000 units, the company's worst results in three years. To make matters worse, for the first time in decades (if not ever), the quarterly sales of AMD GPUs declined despite the launch of new halo products. Jon Peddie, the head of Jon Peddie Research, believes the poor performance was a result of an AMD demand misprediction in Q1.

Nvidia sold around 8.46 million standalone graphics processors for desktops, the company's best result in three years, especially keeping in mind that the company sold quite expensive products ($379 - $1999) during the first quarter and these products happen to be some of the best graphics cards around. 



""AMD and Nvidia have to walk a tight rope wire when it comes to placing orders at fabs like TMSC — and you never get it right all the time,"" said Jon Peddie, president of Jon Peddie Research, in a conversation with Tom's Hardware. ""Forecasting demand six to nine months in advance, when the economic and political environment is so unstable adds an additional layer of complexity. Then you have yield issues on top of it all, and of course you have to get the specs right. Nonetheless, AMD has been doing this for decades and knows all those tradeoffs, plus in their case they have the added burden of balancing resources of demand for Zen CPUs against GPUs.""

The numbers from Jon Peddie Research appear to contradict comments made by Lisa Su, Chief Executive of AMD, who stated during the quarter that the launch of the company's Radeon RX 9070-series products was AMD's most successful product launch in terms of first-week sales. Yet, this is not exactly the case. Jon Peddie Research monitors how many GPU chips each company sells-in to its partners per quarter, not the number of cards sold through retailers. By contrast, Lisa Su mentioned sold through results of the Radeon RX 9070-series, referring to the final stage where the retailer sells the product to the end user.

Images of AMD's early Navi 48 graphics processors — the GPUs that power the Radeon RX 9070-series boards — indicate that their assembly took place in late October 2024, which means that production of the actual silicon started approximately 90 days prior, in late July 2024. This suggests that AMD had been building up inventory for several months ahead of the official launch on March 6, 2025. 

While the total number of GPUs and add-in boards accumulated before the release remains unclear, Jon Peddie Research reported back in March that AMD delivered around 1.43 million discrete desktop GPUs to partners in the fourth quarter of 2024. The lion's share of these processors were likely AMD's Navi 48, so it is reasonable to conclude that AMD entered the first quarter of 2025 with a substantial stockpile of Navi 48 chips. Although precise figures are not available, it is likely that AMD's partners shipped well over a million Radeon RX 9070-series graphics cards during the quarter. However, this was a result of accumulating GPUs over a period of about six months.

By contrast, the company AMD supplied its partners with only around 740,000 to 750,000 GPUs (probably mostly Navi 48 and Navi 44, although we are speculating) in the first quarter, which explains why the company could not meet demand for its Radeon RX 9070 and 9060-series products in the second quarter. The reasons why AMD did not ramp up shipments/production of its Radeon RX 9000-series RDNA 4-based GPUs in late Q4 2024 – early Q1 2025 are unclear. However, JPR's numbers indicate that the company had reduced sales (and possibly production) of GPUs from Q4 to Q1, which is an unprecedented event. This likely means that shortages of AMD's latest Radeon products — the Radeon RX 9060 and 9070 series — will persist at least through the second quarter.

""We were surprised to see AMD's shipments drop so drastically in Q1,"" said Peddie. ""At the same time Nvidia was ramping Blackwell filling any vacuum AMD may have left. Both companies' products have been criticized at the low end, which is traditionally a volume market. But in the past few quarters, the high end has taken off and that is where Nvidia had an open playing field, and so far, still does. So, it is a combination of economic and political instability, and consumer demand shifting to the high end that has caught AMD in a crossfire so to speak.""

While shipments of graphics cards were up in the first quarter, sales of desktop processors dropped. JPR reports that the desktop CPU market contracted sharply as volumes dropped by 14.5% year-over-year and 20.6% sequentially.

""The PC market is caught in the crosswinds, some might say crossfire, of Trump's trade wars, with on-again and off-again, special cutout, and changing import/export rules,"" said Dr. Jon Peddie, president of Jon Peddie Research. ""As part of the turmoil, some PC suppliers have pulled back or held orders, while a few have increased orders, hoping to lock in prices. Pre-ordering to lock in prices is a temporary fix, which will cause a depression in future quarters' sales, as discussed here. We think overall PC sales and, subsequently, client PC GPU sales will be down for the year.”

Resin printing just got even better.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A team of scientists and developers from both the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has put together an impressive resin 3D printer that is able to create more than one material from the same resin. Even more exciting is that one of those materials is dissolvable, making it an ideal option for printing supports in place.

In the world of 3D printing, there are two types of printers leading the way: fused deposition modeling (FDM) and resin printers. FDM printers are the ones you see squeezing filament out of an extruder onto a print bed. Resin printers rely on precise light exposure to build layers in a vat of liquid resin. It's through this technology that the team was able to hone in on specific wavelengths to generate the differing materials.

According to the team, the resin is comprised mostly of acrylate monomers and epoxy, which is crucial. The printer is designed to use two different types of light beams when printing. One is ultraviolet, while the other is just visible light. Focusing these lights in tandem allows the printer to develop multiple materials from a single resin.

When the UV light is focused into the resin, solid permanent structures are formed. This is used for the main object you're printing. When visible light hits the same resin, a solid material is formed that will dissolve in 15 minutes when placed in a lye solution. This is what makes the material ideal for printing supports.

To demonstrate the system in action, the team has created a handful of objects that would be impossible to print otherwise. For example, they managed to print a ball suspended in a cage that moves about freely once the support material is dissolved. They also created a chain of interlocked rings and a checkerboard pattern.

If you're new to 3D printing or are looking to upgrade your current printer, check out our list of best 3D printers to see which ones we personally recommend. This also gives you an idea of what's leading the market. Unfortunately, you won't find any resin printers capable of creating two materials from a single resin but in the meantime, we can at least appreciate the work this team has done so far to innovate how we handle resin printing.

Theories range from poor quality seals to staff needing to check if the Mario Kart World code was still inside.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Several Nintendo fans who just received their Switch 2 and Mario Kart World bundle claim to have received boxes that had broken seals on them. According to multiple Reddit posts, the issue is widespread with several British retailers affected, including Currys, Argos, John Lewis, and Smyths — even those who reportedly purchased directly from Nintendo received boxes with broken seals.

One Redditor claimed Argos staff told him that the issue was caused by Nintendo using “seals with insufficient strength,” leading to them breaking while in transit or storage. On the other hand, others claim that the seal was cut cleanly, as if with a knife or scissors, meaning it was unlikely to have happened accidentally.

Someone who picked up their pre-order from Currys had the same issue. When they asked the staff about it, they were told that the boxes had to be opened to check if the Mario Kart World code was inside the box. Some customers reported that their code was missing, so someone in the supply chain, at least in the UK, took it upon themselves to check for them. One even said seeing getting an “opened and examined” sticker on their retail box, possibly indicating that their newly-purchased handheld console had been tampered with.

One commenter also claimed that they bought theirs in Italy, and they have the same issue. They said that they bought it from Unieuro, and the staff claimed that the whole stock arrived in their store in that condition.

There's no official statement from Nintendo or other retailers about this yet, but it seems that the affected units all had the Mario Kart World bundle. EE and Currys were not immediately available for comment. Argos declined to comment on the story.

Nevertheless, even though the units had broken seals, it looks like nothing inside the affected boxes is missing. This will give affected buyers some relief, especially as a few were already worried that they're getting a tampered unit or receiving rocks instead of the handheld.

This isn't the first brouhaha Nintendo is facing with the launch of its most-awaited console. GameStop customers in the U.S. were flabbergasted to find that the staples used to stick their receipts on the box had punctured through the thin protective cardboard layer and damaged the screen of their console. While a few were frustrated at the retailer for doing so, many more were disappointed at Nintendo because its packaging wasn't as protective of the precious contents as it should be.

A recent BBC report suggests that cerumen, commonly known as earwax, may harbor biomarkers to aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of conditions such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and metabolic disorders.

The primary function of cerumen is to keep the external auditory canal clean and lubricated, preventing invasion by bacteria, fungi, and insects. Beyond this, cerumen may reflect systemic metabolism by concentrating a broader array of compounds than blood, urine, sweat, and tears. Its relative stability allows the accumulated cerumen to provide long-term snapshots of metabolic changes. 

Researchers have defined genetically determined wet and dry cerumen phenotypes. In the US, Caucasian, African American, and German women with wet cerumen faced roughly four times the risk of dying from breast cancer compared with Japanese and Taiwanese women with dry cerumen. The study found that Japanese women with breast cancer were more likely to carry the wet-cerumen allele than were healthy controls. However, large-scale studies in Germany, Australia, and Italy failed to confirm these associations. 

A recent analysis reported that patients with Ménière's disease had lower levels of three fatty acids in the cerumen compared with healthy controls — the first biomarker identified for that disorder. 

In a 2019 study led by Nelson Roberto Antoniosi Filho, PhD (Federal University of Goiás Goiânia in Brazil), researchers analyzed cerumen samples from 52 patients with lymphoma, carcinoma, or leukemia and 50 healthy volunteers, using a method that identifies volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The researchers identified 27 VOCs that served as diagnostic fingerprints for cancer, predicting the cancer status with 100% accuracy. The assay could not distinguish among cancer types, indicating that these VOCs represent a general response to malignant cells. 

Another investigation by the same group showed that cerumen analysis can detect metabolic disturbances in premalignant stages when cells exhibit dysplastic changes that may lead to cancer but remain nonmalignant, potentially enabling much earlier intervention. The team is also investigating whether metabolic alterations caused by neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, can be detected in the cerumen. 

Antoniosi Filho and colleagues proposed that cancer, as a mitochondrial metabolic disorder, releases VOCs that accumulate in cerumen, allowing differentiation between healthy and cancerous individuals via an assay they call the cerumenogram. The aim was to develop a cerumenogram as a diagnostic tool to accurately predict certain cancers from a small cerumen sample. 

Hospital Amaral Carvalho in Jaú, São Paulo — a national reference center for oncology and bone marrow transplantation — has recently implemented cerumenograms for cancer diagnosis and monitoring. 

An April 2025 paper in Scientific Reports by Antoniosi Filho concluded that the cerumenogram could: 

1. Identify oncologic risk by detecting premalignant cells before cancer onset, introducing a novel screening modality 

2. Show that mitochondrial impairment in premalignant cells — such as hypermetabolic inflammation and dysplasia — produces the same VOC biomarkers as malignant cells, distinct from those in benign lesions, opening new paths for risk management and early intervention 

3. Correlate cerumenogram findings with established imaging techniques such as 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-D-glucose PET/CT (18F-FDG PET/CT) and gallium-68 PSMA PET/CT, demonstrating alignment with clinical results while offering a noninvasive, lower-cost alternative 

4. Monitor treatment response and cancer remission, supporting assessment of therapeutic efficacy and cellular return to normal 

5. Confirm metabolic indicators of malignancy to guide clinical decisions alongside imaging and biopsy 

6. Drive the development of targeted therapies aimed at metabolites overproduced in malignant conditions. 

In conclusion, the cerumenogram may serve as a valuable assay for evaluating precancerous indicators, cancer progression, and remission, with the potential to reduce mortality, alleviate patient suffering, and lower disease-related costs. 

Congratulations to Nelson Roberto Antoniosi Filho, PhD, and his team.

Music's influence on the brain is documented in conditions ranging from dementia to epilepsy. Both music participation and appreciation are tied to improvements in executive function and memory so how close are we to harnessing music as a targeted therapeutic tool?

One researcher at the forefront of this work is Edward Large, PhD, a professor at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut, and director of its Music Dynamics Laboratory. He told Medscape Medical News that he is optimistic about research suggesting that music can help, “not just with depression and anxiety but with more profound neurological and psychological disorders.”

However, he added that music's benefits aren't yet fully understood. Robert Zatorre, PhD, founding co-director of the International Laboratory for Brain, Music, and Sound Research in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, cautions against overstating its therapeutic power.

“Music is not a magic pill; it's not a panacea; it doesn't cure everything,” said Zatorre who is also a professor at the Montreal Neurological Institute at McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Instead, it's important to define under what circumstances music could be beneficial and in what ways. “And that's where the research is right now” he said.

One challenge is music's deeply personal nature — what resonates with one person may leave another unmoved. Variables such as culture, age, personal history, social context, and even the nature of the neurological condition can influence how someone will respond to music-based interventions, said Zatorre.

Large, a former president of the Society for Music Perception and Cognition and a musician himself, believes that one of the most important messages from research is the effect that music has on the rhythm of the brain.

Brain rhythms or waves, also known as neural oscillations, are patterns of brain activity associated with various cognitive processes and behaviors. In healthy brains, slow theta waves (4-8 Hz) and fast gamma waves (30-100 Hz) work together (coupling) to encode and retrieve new memories. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by disruptions in gamma waves and atypical cross-frequency coupling.

“Music is really the most powerful stimulus we have for synchronizing brain rhythms,” said Large.

His group is testing whether stimulating synchrony in the gamma frequency can help treat AD. “That's the frequency at which neurons in the hippocampus synchronize when they're retrieving a memory”, he said. Noninvasive, gamma-frequency, auditory-visual stimulation has been shown to improve AD-related biomarkers and memory in animal models.

Large is CEO of Oscillo Biosciences which is developing music based interventions for humans.

He explained how such interventions might work: The individual listens to self-selected music and watches a rhythmic light stimulus that is synchronized to the music as their brain waves are monitored via electroencephalography. The light show works in concert with the music to stimulate theta and gamma neural rhythms and phase-amplitude coupling (See photo).

It takes both the music and the synchronized light to have a similar effect to that seen for transcranial alternating-current stimulation, he said.

In addition to its potential memory boosting, music can help improve motor control.

A music app was shown to improve gait and mood in patients with PD.

Daniel J. Levitin, PhD, a neuroscientist and professor emeritus of psychology at McGill University noted in a recent interview with CBC Radio, that music's steady beat can act as “an external timekeeper” for patients with PD, helping them to walk better because of the auditory stimulation. For multiple sclerosis (MS), Levitin said that music can activate non-demyelinated circuits in order to help with motor control.

He echoed Zatorre's view that while the idea of a music prescription is appealing, what works best for a patient seems to be highly individualized.

“It's not like there is a single healing song or a list of healing songs,” he said in the interview. Instead, brain scans show that different types of songs can produce “almost identical” brain activity in the limbic system, which is closely involved in experiencing pleasure, Levitin added.

The pleasure that music brings may be the source of its positive effects.

“I'm convinced that a lot of the benefits of these musical interventions act via the reward system,” said Zatorre who has conducted several related studies and authored a chapter on “Musical Enjoyment and the Reward Circuits of the Brain” for a book on Music and Mind edited by opera singer Renée Fleming.

By engaging the reward system “it has knock-on effects on a lot of behaviors and cognitions, including social cognition and memory and language,” he said.

Zatorre theorized that music heard by a patient with a memory disorder will activate the reward pathway and simultaneously enhance the retrieval of certain memories. “That's something that has been observed anecdotally in many patients with neurodegenerative disorders,” he said.

There is evidence that the connectivity of the auditory and reward systems is preserved in people with mild cognitive impairment and early AD opening up a potential pathway for early treatment. “I'm not sure we're there yet. But it's something that people are excited about,” said Zatorre.

Familiar music tends to elicit a greater neural response, especially in older people, because once we reach a certain age, we know what we like and sticking to that brings enjoyment, which is linked to dopamine, explained Zatorre.

The reward system is highly reactive in younger people. “We not only fall in love with people [more easily] at that age, we fall in love with all sorts of things and places and movies and music. And that tends to stay with us,” Zatorre said.

Large is currently conducting a functional MRI study in patients with AD that compares music that is self-selected and “meaningful” to the participants with music that is merely familiar.

The meaningful music activates important parts of the brain such as the auditory cortex, hippocampus, and reward centers more than the familiar music, he reported. “So if you're trying to have an impact on your brain, I think you should listen to the music that you love.”

A number of recent studies have suggested that physically participating in music may be even better for the brain than passively listening (Figure).

In a large nested study published last year, playing a musical instrument was linked to better executive function in older adults, with stronger links for woodwind instruments.

Keyboard playing was associated with better working memory compared to not playing any instrument. This study did not show any significant associations between listening to music and cognitive performance but singing was associated with better executive function.

Group singing may be particularly beneficial. A Finnish study tied singing in a choir to enhanced brain-structure connectivity across the lifespan of participants with no neurologic diagnoses at baseline.

Another recent study in 50 patients with chronic aphasia after stroke found that those assigned to participate in weekly sessions of group singing had improved communication and responsive speech production 5 months later compared to those who received standard of care.

“It has to do with the vocal motor control, the ability to control your larynx and your breathing and your articulators, as well as the vocalization that singing requires as opposed to speaking,” said Zatorre, who was not involved with the research.

He added that the social aspect of the intervention is also important, especially the “singing together with other people who are suffering the same difficulties as you.”

But what about people with congenital amusia ie, the tone deaf? Zatorre noted that about 50% of people who are tone deaf have perfect rhythm. “They may not have the pitch correct, but they still are on time. So they can clap, or tap, or march, or dance, along to the beat,” he said.

While many may think they are tone deaf, it's estimated that only 1.5%of the general population have true congenital amusia and even fewer also have no rhythm. “They may not enjoy the music itself but could enjoy the more social aspects of it. It's enjoying bonding with others, even if you're singing off-key,” said Zatorre.

He pointed out that patients with aphasia usually don't sing very well, “but that's not the point.” Instead, the goal is improved outcome, he added. As the saying goes “sing like there's nobody listening.” 

Could music be used as a preventive intervention to stave off, say, dementia in younger at-risk individuals? 

“I think the answer is [that] we don't really know,” Large said. Although there are still questions about whether amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques are a cause or a symptom of AD, it's been shown that there is a desynchrony of rhythms in the gamma frequency band before a buildup of Aβ plaques occurs, he explained.

“I think that offers some hope that these rhythm-based therapies might have a preventive impact,” said Large.

Zatorre acknowledged that research on music as a preventive intervention is “quite scarce,” but noted that adding music can still improve quality of life.

“Music is an important art form that almost all people are sensitive to. If you're having a better quality of life, that will enhance everything. Even if it doesn't prevent the formation of plaques in your brain, you will still have a happier existence. And then if you do develop any type of degenerative disorder, you'll have more tools in your toolbox to help you cope,” he said.

However, Zatorre noted that the same could be said for cooking or exercise or anything else that gives pleasure to an individual.

“I worry that music may have been a bit oversold to people, especially from those who are promoting a website or some type of self-help product. So I think caution is in order,” he said.

Zatorre has reported no relevant financial relationships. Large reported being the CEO of Oscillo Biosciences and having an ownership interest as a founder.

D-serine as an adjunctive treatment did not outperform placebo overall in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), a new trial showed. However, depressive symptoms and anhedonia were significantly alleviated among patients with severe MDD, particularly among those on higher doses of standard medications.

""DS [D-serine] may offer therapeutic benefits for patients with severe MDD, particularly when used alongside greater doses of TAU [treatment as usual] medication. These findings support the potential of DS as a synergistic adjunctive strategy to enhance the therapeutic effect of pharmacological interventions, especially in severe cases,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Lukas Sempach, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland. It was published online on May 26 in the Journal of Affective Disorders.

The small sample size limited the study's generalisability and reduced its power to detect small to moderate treatment effects, particularly in patients with severe depression. Additionally, the relatively low dose of D-serine used, along with its metabolism, may have limited its engagement with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors.

This study was supported by the Gertrud Thalmann Foundation of the University Psychiatric Clinics Basel and the Stiftung zur Förderung der gastroenterologischen und allgemeinen klinischen Forschung sowie der medizinischen Bildauswertung. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

PHOENIX — Frexalimab, a second-generation anti-CD40 ligand monoclonal antibody provides extended tight control of multiple sclerosis (MS) whether measured by relapse or brain imaging at 2-year follow-up, results of an open-label extension (OLE) of a phase 2 trial showed.

“At week 96, there was almost complete suppression of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions with very similar pattern seen with new or enhancing T2 lesions,” said study investigator Stephen Krieger, MD, professor of neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City.

Two phase 3 international studies with this drug are already enrolling.

“Part of the interest in frexalimab and anti-CD40 therapies is the idea that one can modulate both B- and T-cell activity without cell depletion,” explained Krieger, who presented the long-term open-label data on May 29 at the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC) 2025 Annual Meeting.

The latest data suggest frexalimab is fulfilling its promise. Over follow-up to date, there has been nearly complete suppression of gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions on MRI among those taking the dose now being tested in the phase 3 trials. At 2 years, with an annualized relapse rate of 0.08%, 92% of patients were relapse-free.

The randomized portion of this phase 2 trial attracted attention when it was published a year ago in The New England Journal of Medicine, but the 2-year results showed that the efficacy and safety observed at 12 weeks persist.

In the controlled trial, 129 patients with relapsing MS were randomized to 300-mg, 400-mg, 600-mg, or 1200-mg frexalimab or matching placebos. Suppression of Gd+ lesions was the primary endpoint.

At 12 weeks, the adjusted mean of new Gd+ lesions was 1.4 in the combined placebo groups but 0.3 in the 300-mg frexalimab group and 0.2 in the 1200-mg group.

Of those who participated in the randomized portion of the phase 2 trial, 97% continued into the long-term OLE. The OLE consisted of two arms: 1200-mg frexalimab administered intravenously every 4 weeks or 300-mg frexalimab administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks.

At the end of 2 years, when 82% of those enrolled in the OLE were still on medication, the adjusted mean for new T1-weighted Gd+ lesions ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 across study arms whether on continuous frexalimab or switched from placebo to frexalimab. 

For those who were initiated on the 1200-mg dose in the controlled portion of the trial and remained on this dose for the OLE, the mean was 0.1.

For the secondary endpoint of new or enlarging T2 lesions, the suppression at 2 years was almost the same. Again, the adjusted mean for new lesions across all arms ranged from 0.1 to 0.3. For those receiving the 1200-mg dose, the mean was 0.2.

Mean T2 lesion volume increased in the placebo arm but not in the treatment arms during the randomized phase. After entering the OLE, T2 lesion volume fell in placebo patients now on active therapy.

In the 1200-mg arm, the fall in lesion volume during the randomized phase continued into the first 24 weeks of the OLE. After 24 weeks, the lesion volume remained suppressed with no return toward baseline. Those initiated on placebo never caught up after switching to frexalimab.

On the 1200-mg dose of frexalimab, only 8% had any relapse recorded over the extended follow-up. In half, there was a single relapse. Only 2% had three or more relapses.

While the Expanded Disability Status Scale score declined slightly among placebo patients once started on active therapy, there was no change from baseline through 96 weeks in patients started on any active therapy.

As postulated by earlier preclinical and clinical studies, frexalimab had no effect on lymphocyte counts over time. Over the 96-week follow-up, levels of immunoglobulins remained unchanged, according to Krieger who showed graphs with straight lines for these values over the course of the OLE.

Due to the potential of suppressing activation of both T and B cells over time, anti-CD40 therapies have long been considered a promising mechanism for control of MS. However, clinical development of first-generation drugs was abandoned because of an association with thromboembolism.

“Frexalimab has been engineered to avoid these events through a change in the Fc receptors with reduces downstream inflammatory events,” said Krieger.

The long-term data support this premise. Over 2 years, there was one pulmonary embolism, but this exception was observed in a patient with a viral illness and a genetic predisposition for an inflammatory response, according to Krieger.

When surveying other adverse events, “nothing jumps out” in the OLE relative to the randomized phase. One potential exception is a rise in liver function tests observed in two (4%) patients on the 1200-mg dose. Only one of these patients discontinued therapy, and the levels returned to normal over time in both.

The effects of the anti-CD40 mechanism on both the adaptive and innate immune systems suggest frexalimab might offer efficacy for both progressive and relapsing MS. In the ongoing phase 3 program, one of the trials (FREXALT) is enrolling patients with relapsing MS. The other (FREVIVA) is enrolling patients with progressive disease.

Commenting on the results, Amit Bar-Or, MD, Chief of the Multiple Sclerosis Division, the Department of Neurology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, described frexalimab as “a very interesting drug.”

He agreed that the CD40 ligand is a promising target in MS but cautioned that these phase 2 data cannot answer the most interesting questions.

This includes the more robust evidence of safety and efficacy from phase 3 trials, but it remains unclear whether the benefits extend beyond controlling relapsing disease. 

“I think there is particular interest in whether it will also show extended benefit in progressive MS, and this will be a major focus of interest from the next set of studies,” Bar-Or said.

Krieger reported having financial ties with various organizations, including TG Therapeutics and Sanofi, which provided funding for the phase 2 frexalimab trial and open-label extension. Bar-Or reported having financial relationships with 20 pharmaceutical or device companies, including Sanofi, although he was not a co-author of the research Krieger presented.

Medscape turns 30 in 2025. To mark this milestone, the Medscape 2050 project looks at what the field of medicine may look like 25 years from now. But the future is also shaped by the past. Below we look at the previous 30 years through the lens of Medscape News' coverage of the headlines and events that helped define medicine since 1995.

Remember what the early days of the internet were like? That's Medscape, launched out of a tiny office in Manhattan on May 22, 1995, by a scrappy group of people who had a great idea for a website to serve a physician readership. Here's what those early days were like.

John G. Bartlett, MD, offers a thorough breakdown of HAART's evolution, with notable mention of a certain director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Anthony Fauci. Ten years after this breakthrough, Medscape continued in-depth coverage, including this long Q&A with Richard Elion, MD.

The first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction became a cultural phenomenon and, from a news perspective, the gift that kept on giving, leading to ongoing coverage not just in the ensuing years but for decades — including evidence 26 years later that the little blue pill may help prevent Alzheimer's.

The arrival of the new class of painkillers was less newsworthy than what followed later, with Vioxx linked to heart risks and pulled from the market. The fallout brought harsh questions about its initial FDA approval.

The global epidemic led to the first modern pandemic response, and just like the pandemic that would follow 17 years later, it spurred ongoing Medscape coverage that may seem quaint in retrospect.

Our 10th anniversary brought a comprehensive reckoning of some of the major medical advances from 1995 to 2004, including analysis of impactful stories across all specialties.

A new day for reconstructive surgery when surgeons grafted the donor nose, lips, and chin to the face of a 38-year-old French woman whose lips and nose were ripped off in a dog attack. The breakthrough procedure led to a sharp debate about whether the surgery should have happened at all.

Six years after SARS, H1N1 gave us the first official flu pandemic in decades, prompting massive vaccine production, as well as inevitable comparisons to the 1918 pandemic, with the two strains, separated by 91 years, sharing similar features.

President Obama's signature legislation was a seismic health policy shift increasing insurance access. The law has been scrutinized (and challenged) ever since. Meanwhile, more than 24 million people signed up for ACA Marketplace Coverage for 2025, a new record.

Celebrities can single-handedly transform public discourse on health issues, and Jolie did just that with hereditary cancer risk. As a result of the “Angelina Jolie Effect,” BRCA testing doubled.

While the outbreak highlighted weaknesses in global public health infrastructure, Medscape highlighted what US clinicians needed to know — as well as what they didn't know. In September, the WHO convened a 2-day meeting in Geneva to discuss therapies derived from survivors' blood.

Addiction treatment, regulation, and pharmaceutical accountability all became part of public medical discourse as part of the outcry to declare a state of emergency on opioids. President Trump eventually declared the crisis a national public health emergency. In 2019, opioid-related deaths reached almost 72,000, a new high. Death rates continued to rise well into 2020.

A global spike in cases, especially in the US and Europe, foreshadowed measles news in 2025, but physicians were just as concerned then about the measles and vaccine hesitancy.

Perhaps the biggest medical news event in Medscape's history, and as you can see, this selection of six headlines offers a telling timeline of just what was going on — what we knew and a whole lot we didn't….

Medicare payments to physicians for common gastrointestinal procedures have declined in recent years, while reimbursement to ambulatory surgical centers and hospital outpatient departments has increased or held steady, according to a new analysis.

These trends may exacerbate concerns that current federal payment policies are favoring consolidation in healthcare, while putting more financial pressure on clinicians in small and individual practices.

In a recent American Journal of Gastroenterology paper, Dipen Patel, MD, of Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Chicago, and coauthors analyzed trends in Medicare reimbursement from 2018 to 2023 for colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) procedures. They compared changes in Medicare's physician compensation to changes in facility reimbursements for the same procedures. The results of their analysis are summarized below.

Physician Fee Schedule (Adjusted for Inflation): 

Ambulatory Surgical Centers (Adjusted for Inflation):

Hospital Outpatient Departments (Adjusted for Inflation):

The researchers examined 31 current procedural terminology codes for colonoscopy and 26 for EGD procedures.

Patel, who graduated from the University of Texas Medical Branch School of Medicine, Galveston, Texas, in 2019, said part of the motivation behind the study was to raise awareness among younger physicians who may not track Medicare policy closely.

“For my generation of physicians who are coming out of training, we don't really know much about these trends,” Patel told Medscape Medical News. “We don't really know what the policies are or how they are playing out.”

Other recent studies have identified similar patterns — where professional fees have declined while facility reimbursement either rose or declined to a lesser degree for common orthopedic procedures such as shoulder surgeries and knee and hip arthroplasty.

Patel and coauthors noted that Medicare has significant influence over US healthcare. It's the largest purchaser of healthcare services, with total annual spending exceeding $1 trillion. Commercial insurers also factor in Medicare's payment rates while setting their own reimbursement for services.

The American Medical Association (AMA) has linked physician fee schedule cuts to a shift away from independent practice ownership. In May, the AMA released results from its biennial Physician Practice Benchmark Survey (administered with WebMD/Medscape). Among the findings:

Members of both parties of Congress have backed proposals to create automatic updates in the base rate for the Medicare physician fee schedule to reflect rising costs. For example, more than 170 members of the House supported a 2023 bipartisan bill that would have created automatic annual updates for the base rate of the physician fee schedule to keep up with inflation.

The bill sought increases that would fully reflect the Medicare Economic Index (MEI), a measure used to estimate changes in costs for clinicians in practice. That bill stalled when the 119th session of Congress began in January.

A Republican-led budget package contains a similar ─ but more limited ─ proposal. It would increase the Medicare physician fee schedule's base rate, but by less than the full expected gain in inflation.

The House-passed version of this bill would create an initial annual bump equal to 75% of the expected MEI change, with subsequent annual increases would be 10% of that index.

The Senate will work this month on the budget package, known as a reconciliation bill, likely making changes to the House-passed measure.

In a May letter to top House officials. AMA described the House's MEI proposal as “a foundational step toward comprehensive Medicare physician payment reform in the 119th Congress,” meaning the current session which ends in January 2027.

Gary Young, PhD, director of the Northeastern University Center for Health Policy and Healthcare Research, told Medscape Medical News that debates about consolidation in healthcare have persisted for decades.

“As far back as the 1970s, some people advocated for uniting hospitals and physician practices, seeing this as a way to reduce fragmentation and create more efficient care,” said Young, who has studied both Medicare's variation in pay for services and the effect on patients of hospital acquisition of practices.

“There are people who say they never really understood why hospitals and physicians were separate to begin with,” Young said. “Others really lament the idea that the independent physician sector may go away. They ask: ‘Do we really want all of our physicians to be under the control of healthcare systems and corporate entities?'” 

Young also noted that in many cases, physicians initiate buyout discussions with healthcare systems due to financial pressures.

“Many physician practices are struggling, and they approach hospitals sort of as a white knight,” he said.

The American Hospital Association (AHA) has made a similar argument, telling lawmakers that its members have offered “a lifeline” to struggling physician practices ─ especially in rural areas.

Last year, the AHA submitted ideas for aiding physicians to the health panel of the Ways and Means Committee. The Ways and Means health committee held a May hearing titled “The Collapse of Private Practice: Examining the Challenges Facing Independent Medicine.”

The AHA recommended:

“While a disproportionate amount of attention has been placed on hospitals' acquisition of physician practices, the reality is that large commercial insurers including CVS Health and UnitedHealth Group have recently spent billions of dollars to acquire physician practices,” AHA said in its statement.

Patel and coauthors have disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

Children with a genetic variant linked to atopic eczema (rs10214237) appeared less likely to develop the condition if they were exposed to dogs in their early years, according to a large European study.

“We know that genetic make-up affects a child's risk of developing eczema and previous studies have shown that owning a pet dog may be protective, but this is the first study to show how this may occur at a molecular level,” study author Sara J. Brown, MD, PhD, of the Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, said in a press release from Wiley, the publisher of Allergy. “More work is needed, but our findings mean we have a chance to intervene in the rise of allergic disease, to protect future generations.”

The study was led by Marie Standl, Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München — German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany, and was published online on June 4 in Allergy.

Genome-wide interaction analysis was not conducted. Replication samples sizes were not powered for some interactions. Detailed data on environmental factors were not available. The inclusion of predominantly White population may limit generalizability of findings. 

The study received funding from the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking, which was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations.

 June 06, 2025  

Hyperinsulinemia appears to have an early association with common causes of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), particularly in women with obesity, a preliminary study in Menopause found. Although preliminary, the study data suggested the opportunity for future research on potential relationships between cardiovascular disease risk factors and gynecologic disease.

“Many studies and organizational bodies have examined and asserted a relationship between polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and elevated insulin levels,” wrote investigators led by Andrea C. Salcedo, DO, MPH, of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Loma Linda University in Loma Linda, California. They noted that AUB is the most common reason for benign gynecologic consultation in the United States.

“After over 15 years of clinical practice, I started realizing there were several patterns in women who presented with irregular or heavy periods. Many were self-referred or sent by their primary care providers to see me to evaluate for female hormone problems,” Salcedo told Medscape Medical News. “The majority were not in perimenopause, but they had similar risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as obesity, hypertension, and migraine headaches.”

Salcedo began to wonder whether healthcare providers are recognizing abnormal periods in reproductive age as a cardiovascular risk and using them to educate women on prevention rather than solely treating them medically or surgically.

“I believe that the theory of the uterus as an ‘end organ' that receives inflammation in the same way as the heart and kidneys do in cardiovascular disease helps explain to the patient the reasons for heavy or irregular periods.” The study findings came as no surprise to her: “They confirmed the patterns I was seeing clinically.”

Hyperinsulinemia is associated with smooth blood vessel inflammation in the peripheral circulation. “What is often under-recognized is that the uterus is made of these same blood vessels.” When the uterus is on the receiving end of inflammation, the blood vessels are damaged and do not function appropriately. The result can be uterine fibroids or heavy periods. The gynecologic expression of this inflammation can vary from person to person, she added.

This exploratory cross-sectional analysis of the association between hyperinsulinemia and biomarkers of metabolic syndrome in reproductive-aged women with AUB was designed to motivate future hypothesis-driven research.

It was conducted from June 2019 to August 2023 at a single institution's outpatient gynecology clinics. A total of 205 premenopausal women aged 18-54 years were enrolled, including 116 with AUB and 89 control individuals with normal menstrual cycles. Approximately 40% in each group were identified as Hispanic.

Participants underwent assessment for fasting insulin and additional markers of metabolic syndrome, including body mass index (BMI), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and waist-to-hip ratio.

Among the findings:

• Hyperinsulinemia, the main effect of interest, was a significant predictor of AUB, affecting 44.0% of the AUB group vs 33.7% of the control group, with an odds ratio of 3.0 (95% CI, 1.372-6.832; P = .0085).

• Hypertension, LDL, HDL, smoking, migraines, and polyps or fibroids were all significantly associated with AUB and identified as confounders. Chronic hypertension was identified in 26% of the AUB group vs 12% of the control group. 

• Interestingly, including BMI in the model diminished the significance of hyperinsulinemia, suggesting overlapping or mediating pathways, the authors said. 

• Among metabolic markers, LDL levels were similar between groups, while HDL levels were lower in women with AUB (54.0 vs 60.0 mg/dL).

• There was a nonsignificant intergroup difference in triglycerides (82.0 vs 73.5 mg/dL) and total cholesterol levels (169.0 vs 172.5 mg/dL).

• Migraines were more prevalent in the AUB group (31.0% vs 11.2%), as were polyps or fibroids (45.7% vs 9.6%).

Commenting on the study but not involved in it, Maureen Whelihan, MD, a gynecologist at the Center for Sexual Health and Education and Elite GYN Care of the Palm Beaches in Greenacres, Florida, called the study an interesting one, “suggesting that before we see the effects of PCOS, a diagnosis of hyperinsulinemia can be made and managed and that hyperinsulinemia has a direct effect on microinflammatory injury to the uterus.”

In her practice, women with insulin resistance and PCOS have major infertility issues. “About 85% are obese and have lipid disorders. While this study indicates we can make a diagnosis earlier by evaluating fasting insulin, the question is, ‘then what?'” she said.

The ultimate remedy is diet and lifestyle modification. “The minute patients understand they must eliminate starch and sugar to lower insulin levels and move their body a little, we lose them,” she said. “They want a quick fix and nothing that requires them to make difficult decisions and drastic modifications. This is the hard part! We can teach them the pathophysiology all day, but they have to commit to a permanent change in the way they approach diet and exercise.”

While the study findings are exploratory and preliminary, Salcedo said, they suggest that abnormal periods may have predictive value. “In many cases, elevated fasting insulin levels, above 10 µU/mL, could be an early sign of cardiovascular and diabetes disease risk.”

In this study, elevated insulin levels were associated with AUB, particularly among those with obesity. “Therefore, when a patient sees her healthcare provider for irregular periods, it could be an excellent opportunity to discuss the known association of menstrual problems with [cardiovascular] risk factors.”

Larger, longitudinal studies are needed, however, to confirm the causal mechanisms, Salcedo said.

This study was supported by Loma Linda University's Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics Research Funds. The authors had no competing interests to disclose. Whelihan disclosed no competing interests relevant to her comments.

Compared with placebo, low-dose methotrexate administered weekly at doses up to 15 mg for 52 weeks did not relieve knee pain or reduce the size of effusion-synovitis in patients with inflammatory knee osteoarthritis (OA).

“Given the lack of efficacy of MTX [methotrexate] across knee OA studies and the known potential adverse events, it is not recommended for the treatment of painful, inflammatory knee OA. We now need to focus our attention on treatments that can both inhibit joint inflammation and stimulate chondrocytes within the cartilage to synthesize replacement matrix. The future of pharmaceuticals for knee OA needs to move past MTX,” Nancy E. Lane, MD, UC Davis Health, Sacramento, California, wrote in an accompanying editorial.

This study was led by Zhaohua Zhu, PhD, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China. It was published online on June 2, 2025, in JAMA Internal Medicine.

A large multicenter prospective cohort study has expanded “the understanding of the range of manifestations of disease in patients with relapsing polychondritis [RP]” — particularly involving the ear, nose, throat, and musculoskeletal systems — as well as a high prevalence of organ damage, near-universal use of glucocorticoids, and frequent use of additional nonbiologic or biologic immunomodulatory therapies.

“Standardized assessment of disease activity is warranted for patients with RP for early detection and timely initiation of treatment. These findings also highlight the absence of a consensus approach to treatment for patients with RP and underscore the need for clinical trials and treatment guidelines in this disease to help reduce the enormous burden of disease for patients,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Roger Yang, MD, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was published online on May 20, 2025, in ACR Open Rheumatology.

This study did not capture data on dose and duration of immunomodulatory medications or clinical features at treatment decisions.

 June 06, 2025  

By the time many children with lingering symptoms of COVID-19 reach Lael Yonker's pediatric pulmonology clinic, they have likely been told those problems are “just a cold.”

“When kids come to me, they're very frustrated. They often will cry just because I'm listening to them and I'm not questioning whether or not they have long COVID,” Yonker, MD, associate professor of pediatrics at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said. “I'm trying to address their symptoms.”

Often, family members bring up the possibility of long COVID, she said. That's because when caregivers relay the symptoms of poor appetite and sleepiness, most pediatricians do not think the chronic condition could be a possible diagnosis, she said.

Until now, only small studies had been published on characterizations of the condition in infants, toddlers, and preschoolers, Yonker said.

But new research published in JAMA Pediatrics found distinct patterns of long COVID symptoms in young children.

Researchers from the NIH-funded RECOVER-Pediatrics Consortium analyzed data from over 1000 children aged 0-5 years, comparing those with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection to uninfected peers.

The study found that 14% of infected infants and toddlers and 15% of infected preschoolers had probable long COVID, similar to rates in teens and school-aged children.

For infants and toddlers, the most strongly associated and prolonged symptoms associated with a history of COVID-19 infection were poor appetite, trouble sleeping, wet and dry cough, and stuffy nose. In preschool-aged children, daytime tiredness, and dry cough were prominent. Teens and school-aged children are more likely to have memory trouble, lightheadedness, and other neurologic issues.

The findings may challenge the assumptions of clinicians that very young children are less affected by long COVID, held in part because this population often cannot describe what they are experiencing.

“There is an underappreciation among parents and pediatricians that long COVID can present in younger children,” said Suchitra Rao, MD, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado in Aurora, who was not involved in the study. “Much of the existing literature has focused on adults, so this is an important study which can shed more light on how younger children present with lingering symptoms.”

Rachel Gross, MD, an associate professor of pediatrics at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and Bellevue Hospital Center in New York City and lead author of the new study, said identifying long COVID in very young children can be challenging.

“They have limited verbal communication, limited social skills, and even a limited understanding of what their symptoms mean to them and how they can express it,” she said.

Because of this, Gross and her colleagues relied on caregiver reports in the study.

The study included 1186 children under the age of 6 years, 670 of whom had tested positive for the virus at some point; 516 children had not been infected. Caregivers of all children completed a detailed survey about their children's symptoms that had lasted for more than 4 weeks since the pandemic began, whether or not the problems were related to COVID-19 infection.

The researchers defined prolonged symptoms as those lasting more than 4 weeks and still present at the time of reporting. On average, infants and toddlers had symptoms that lingered for 10 months and nearly 17 months in preschool-aged children.

Using their findings, the researchers developed an age-specific tool to identify children likely to have long COVID. For infants and toddlers, symptoms like poor appetite and sleep problems were more common. For preschoolers, fatigue and dry cough were key signs. If a child's score crossed a certain threshold, they were classified as “long COVID probable.”

Children with higher scores on the index “often had worse overall health, lower quality of life, and delays in development,” said Tanayott Thaweethai, PhD, associate director of Biostatistics Research and Engagement at Massachusetts General Hospital and an author of the study.

The instrument is currently applicable in research settings, not clinical practice, Thaweethai said.

“It's not meant to be by itself a diagnostic tool,” Thaweethai said. “There very much could be children who are experiencing long COVID who may not present in exactly this way.”

Still, Thaweethai said he hopes pediatricians recognize its potential value.

“These are important signs that warrant further investigation to really determine if these symptoms for that child are attributable to a prior COVID infection,” he said.

Current clinical guidelines for long COVID rely on research in adults. But across pediatric and adult medicine, the condition remains without a clinical biomarker.

“There isn't a blood test right now or any specific test for diagnosing long COVID,” Gross said. “It really is diagnosed based on this history of prolonged symptoms.”

Gross suggested clinicians ask parents to track their children's symptoms — documenting start date, duration, and severity.

While the study did not specifically evaluate the effects of vaccination on the risk for long COVID, Thaweethai said prior studies have suggested vaccines for the disease are protective against prolonged symptoms.

“There are essentially no treatments for long COVID, and vaccination can prevent COVID. Therefore, it's one of our only tools for preventing long COVID,” he said.

“We really need to understand how long children are having these symptoms, how they wax and wane over time, how getting a reinfection with COVID changes the symptoms and the trajectory,” Gross said. “If we're seeing these different symptoms in infants and toddlers and preschool aged children, what happens when those particular children enter school age? What happens to the symptoms that they have at that point? We don't have the answers to those questions yet.”

As clinicians and researchers continue to untangle the complexities of long COVID in children, Yonker urged pediatricians to keep listening.

“Long COVID is a disease that impacts life,” she said. “Some of these kids have their lives impacted — if there's school refusal, if they're having post-exertional malaise and not able to participate in activities in school and learn to their potential.”

Japanese researchers reveal that diets rich in pulses and vegetables may help reduce stress levels—not just through nutrients, but by supporting the growth of specific gut bacteria.

Research: The intake of pulses and vegetables is associated with an increase in the Lachnospira abundance and a decrease in stress: Analysis of the ‘Sukoyaka Health Survey'. Image Credit: Santhosh Varghese / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Clinical Nutrition ESPEN, researchers investigated the relationship between diet quality, stress, and gut microbiota. Humans are exposed to stressors daily, and prolonged exposure can have a negative impact on both the body and mind. Besides, it can result in migraines, neurosis, stomach ulcers, anxiety, and depression. The gut microbiota has been linked to stress, with studies suggesting that stress can alter the composition of the gut microbiota and that the gut microbiota, in turn, can influence stress responses.

Furthermore, epidemiological studies suggest that diet plays a crucial role in stress, with various foods and nutrients affecting stress levels. Nutrient profiling is the science of ranking or classifying foods based on their nutritional value to promote health and prevent disease. Nutrient profile models (NPMs) serve as comprehensive assessment indices that consider multiple nutrients simultaneously, rather than focusing on a single one.

Various NPMs have been developed to evaluate diet quality. One such NPM is the Nutrient-Rich Food Index 9.3 (NRF9.3), which can be applied to individual foods, menus, meals, and entire diets. However, there are limited studies on the relationship between health indicators and NRF9.3. Moreover, prior to this research, no study has investigated the relationship between NRF2.3 and the gut microbiota or stress.

Foods acted as entry points: Natto, tomatoes, and green peppers were positioned as starting nodes in the network model, initiating the diet→microbiome→stress chain.

In the present study, researchers investigated the relationships between diet quality, stress, and gut microbiota. They used data from the Sukoyaka Health Survey of Japanese adults aged 20–80, conducted twice a year (in winter and summer). This study analyzed data from the summers of 2019 and 2020. The Brief Job Stress Questionnaire (BJSQ) assessed mental and physical stress response scores, and the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) assessed food and nutrient intake.

The gut microbiota composition was analyzed using shotgun metagenomics. NRF9.3 was used to determine the diet quality. NRF9.3 scores were computed using FFQ data, with higher scores indicating a diet rich in beneficial nutrients (e.g., minerals, dietary fiber, vitamins) and low in nutrients to be moderately consumed (e.g., saturated fat, sodium, added sugars).

Hierarchical clustering was used to stratify subjects based on their stress levels. The gut microbiota composition and diet quality were compared between the clusters. An exploratory probabilistic network modeling analysis was conducted to investigate the statistical associations and possible mediation pathways between gut microbiota, dietary factors, and stress response scores, while adjusting for age, body mass index, and blood pressure. The authors noted that other potential confounders, such as physical activity, socioeconomic status, and probiotic use, could not be adjusted for in this analysis.

Importantly, the study sample consisted of a majority of female participants, which may affect the generalizability of the results.

Age played a hidden role: Older participants showed stronger links between poor diet scores, altered gut bacteria, and higher blood pressure in the pathway analysis.

The study included 1,058 healthy adults aged 48.9, on average. The majority of participants were female, which may affect the generalizability of the results. Hierarchical clustering analysis identified three (optimal) clusters (1–3). Clusters 2 and 3 had significantly higher and lower stress response scores, respectively, representing high-stress and low-stress groups. Cluster 1 represented the medium-stress group. Further, cluster 2 had substantially lower NRF9.3 scores than other clusters, indicating poor diet quality.

Moreover, cluster 2 had significantly reduced intake of vegetables and pulses compared to other clusters. The researchers further investigated specific food items in the FFQ and estimated individual food intake within nine vegetable- and four pulse-based foods. They found that cluster 2 had significantly lower intake of green peppers, tomatoes, and natto than the other clusters.

Cluster 2 also showed significantly reduced relative abundances of Ruminococcus and Lachnospira compared to Cluster 3, and Collinsella compared to Cluster 1. The researchers found a statistically supported mediation pathway: a relationship between NRF9.3 and Lachnospira, as well as between Lachnospira and stress response scores, but not a direct effect of NRF9.3 on stress scores. There was also a significant relationship between the amounts of green peppers, natto, and tomatoes consumed and NRF9.3.

Notably, while natto is a traditional Japanese food, the authors contextualize their findings by stating that similar bioactive components can be found in globally consumed fermented foods such as tempeh or kimchi.

Stress clusters showed unexpected health patterns: The high-stress group had significantly lower blood pressure than the low-stress cluster—a counterintuitive finding suggesting complex physiological stress adaptations.

Taken together, a higher NRF9.3 score was associated with increased relative abundance of Lachnospira and reduced physical and mental stress response scores. Increased Lachnospira abundance was also associated with lower stress response. The relationship between diet quality and stress appears to be mediated via Lachnospira, rather than being a direct effect of diet on stress. Furthermore, increased consumption of green peppers, natto, and tomatoes was associated with higher NRF9.3 scores and Lachnospira abundance, which, in turn, were associated with reduced stress response scores.

The study's limitations include the self-reported nature of eating habits and dietary intake, possible selection bias related to a health-conscious, predominantly female Japanese sample, poor generalizability to other populations, limited adjustments for confounders, and the use of a subjective assessment of stress (BJSQ) rather than objective biomarkers. The cross-sectional design also prevents any inference of causality between diet, gut microbiota, and stress. Additional longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether specific dietary components affect the stress response by modulating gut microbiota.

The authors note that while natto, tomatoes, and green peppers were identified in this Japanese cohort, similar bioactive components are present in other globally consumed foods, and broader dietary patterns rich in polyphenols, dietary fiber, and fermented foods may also be relevant to stress regulation.

A new study has found that older adults living with obesity can feel judged or dismissed by care providers due to their weight, leading to a reluctance to seek help.

Conducted by researchers from Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) and the University of West London, the qualitative study involved in-depth interviews with 33 older adults and has been published in the journal PLOS One.

The participants shared their experiences and needs related to formal and informal social care, and the report highlighted the hidden care gaps caused by obesity.

As well as not asking for help because of concerns over how others might view them, some participants talked about physical barriers, with standard care equipment and facilities often failing to accommodate individuals with higher body weights, resulting in inadequate support.​

The combination of physical limitations and societal stigma also contributed to feelings of isolation and decreased self-worth among participants.​ Financial hardship was also cited as an unmet need, with one interviewee having lost his full-time job due to pain caused by his obesity.

Participants with higher obesity levels reported unmet needs primarily linked to emotional distress, including stress, frustration, social discrimination, isolation, feeling like a burden, lack of housing adaptations and safety, boredom, inability to continue hobbies, and limited access to support.

The study also sets out a new framework designed to understand unmet care needs of older adults with obesity. By identifying these care gaps, it could help care providers plan better health and social care and find where inexpensive, preventive measures could be most effective.

According to the latest Health Survey for England, published in September, 36% of adults aged 55 to 64, and 35% of adults aged 64 to 74, were living with obesity in 2022.

The study underscores the necessity for a more inclusive approach to social care, one that recognises and addresses the specific barriers faced by older adults with obesity.​

Older adults with obesity face unique challenges in accessing and receiving appropriate social care. Despite growing concerns over obesity's impact on health, its influence on social care needs among this demographic remains underexplored.

The hidden challenges faced by these individuals often go unrecognised, leading to unmet need and increased vulnerability. As the population ages and obesity rates continue to rise, it is imperative that our social care systems adapt to meet these evolving needs.

Our research makes clear the need for increased awareness among healthcare professionals to better support older adults with obesity, with policy reforms, training programmes that address weight bias and the development of care plans that address the specific barriers faced by this group.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study aims to demystify the immune toxicity triggered by osimertinib-ICI co-treatment","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250606/Study-aims-to-demystify-the-immune-toxicity-triggered-by-osimertinib-ICI-co-treatment.aspx","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 13:54:00 GMT","

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for the majority of lung cancer cases and remains a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are common in NSCLC and have made EGFR-targeting drugs like osimertinib a cornerstone of treatment. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have also transformed the treatment landscape by reactivating the immune system to attack tumors. Despite their promise, combining these two therapies has proven problematic. Several clinical trials were halted after reporting high incidences of severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs)—such as interstitial pneumonia and hepatitis—linked to the combination. Due to these risks and the lack of mechanistic clarity, there is an urgent need to investigate the cellular drivers of this toxicity and identify safer strategies.

A research team from Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute & Hospital published their findings (DOI: 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2024.0269) in Cancer Biology & Medicine, aiming to demystify the heightened immune toxicity triggered by osimertinib-ICI co-treatment. Through the development of a specialized mouse model mimicking irAEs seen in patients, the team pinpointed activation of the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling cascade in liver macrophages as the culprit. Their results not only offer a compelling explanation for these adverse reactions but also suggest that this toxicity may be preventable through targeted pharmacological intervention.

To explore the root cause of irAEs, the researchers administered osimertinib and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in mice, which resulted in pronounced lung and liver inflammation, increased EGFR expression on macrophages, and elevated blood levels of IL-6, ALT, and ferritin. Notably, flow cytometry revealed that EGFR expression was exclusive to macrophages, not T or NK cells. RNA sequencing confirmed the upregulation of inflammatory signaling, particularly the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 pathway, which was further validated via Western blot analysis. The turning point came when ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, was introduced into the regimen—leading to a marked decrease in inflammatory cytokines despite ongoing tissue-level inflammation. This finding suggests that systemic cytokine release, rather than local tissue damage, may be a more sensitive indicator of irAEs. The study proposes that osimertinib's inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation in macrophages, when combined with ICI-induced immune activation, triggers this inflammatory cascade. These results not only clarify the pathway responsible for irAEs but also spotlight ruxolitinib as a potentially safe and effective countermeasure.

Our findings provide a crucial mechanistic link between osimertinib-ICI therapy and the dangerous cytokine surges seen in patients. By pinpointing the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 axis in liver macrophages, we not only clarify the pathogenesis of immune-related toxicity, but also suggest that targeted inhibitors like ruxolitinib can be safely integrated into cancer immunotherapy regimens. This represents a significant step toward safer combination treatments.""

Dr. Xiubao Ren, corresponding author of the study

This research delivers a mechanistic blueprint for understanding and managing irAEs in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients receiving combination therapy. By selectively inhibiting the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 pathway, clinicians may be able to protect patients from serious inflammatory reactions while preserving the anti-cancer potency of both osimertinib and ICIs. These results pave the way for future clinical trials to assess IL-6 pathway blockers as adjunct therapies in cancer immunotherapy. If successful, this strategy could significantly improve patient safety and expand the clinical utility of EGFR-TKI and ICI combination regimens.

Research reveals that online nutrition tips for pregnant women are often outdated, unverified, and lacking transparency, potentially putting mothers and their babies at risk.

Study: Quality Assessment of Web-Based Information Related to Diet During Pregnancy in Pregnant Women: Cross-Sectional Descriptive Study. Image credit: Makistock/Shutterstock.com

Online health information is abundantly available and accessible in almost every region and locality. Pregnant women lean on it for information, including on their diet. A recent study in the journal JMIR Formative Research examined the quality of this information, filling a known research gap.

During pregnancy, women are often more mindful of their eating habits because they are concerned about the baby's growth and development. This may cause them to look online for health-related information. However, the top search results are often factually incorrect. Pregnant women may not know how to verify key information for accuracy or assess the strength of evidence, which prevents them from making informed dietary decisions. This could impact the health of both mother and baby and may add to the stress of pregnancy.

In Japan, 83% of people use the internet, primarily smartphones and computers, reflecting the worldwide trend. In Canada, 96% of pregnant women resort to it to get answers to their questions about nutrition during pregnancy.

This could help women inform their eating habits, and it is particularly beneficial for first-time mothers or those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Such individuals are typically less likely to get professional nutritional advice. However, other expectant mothers have experienced confusion and anxiety because of conflicting information or because they found they had eaten something they should not.

Online dietary information should be accurate and relevant to the user's needs. Of 18 Australian websites investigated, none fully conformed to evidence-based guidelines. Interestingly, no studies have addressed this question regarding Japanese websites.

Digital resources and content are used in many ways during pregnancy. The study describes a “conceptual model for engagement” to understand how pregnant women interact online with health information, including cognitive, behavioral, collaborative, emotional, and social engagement.

The current study used Google keywords to collate online information about diet in pregnancy and evaluated the quality of the top 20 contributing websites using the Quality Evaluation Scoring Tool (QUEST).

The mean QUEST score was 11.7 points (ranging from 6 to 15).

Half the websites did not name the author. Except for one, no paper provided scientific references for its information. While 13 sites did not offer study references for the expert opinions or documents they claimed to base their content on, six sites provided no sources. These findings suggest a lack of scientific reliability.

The highest quality score was for conflict of interest. Whilst 60% of sites were unbiased, five recommended specific steps, and three recommended services or educational products with some biases.

Only half of the sites had publication date information, indicating that the content had been written within the past five years. Most of the others did not show the date of writing, suggesting a loss of transparency.

The lowest quality score was for complementarity, where 70% of websites did not have a supportive attitude towards the patient-physician relationship.  

While 95% supported their claims, only one site presented a balanced and cautious tone, acknowledging limitations or discussing contrasting evidence, as required for a high QUEST score. The rest failed to highlight such limitations. In most cases, the website information was noncommittal but failed to reveal the limitations of its claims. Conflicting information was also not shown, making the information low-quality.

Several sites provided nutritional information that significantly diverged from current guidelines. This included non-evidence-backed claims about drinking, weight loss, and miscarriage, suggesting the information was unreliable and/or prejudiced.  

For instance, some websites recommend reducing alcohol consumption during pregnancy, which contradicts international guidelines that advise complete abstinence. Japanese guidelines advise setting weight gain goals based on pre-pregnancy weight, but some websites recommend gaining about 11 kg. This generic approach does not reflect official standards. No evidence supports either of these statements.

Those most affected by outdated or unscientific online information about diet during pregnancy are likely to be less educated pregnant women or those with a lower annual income. The study notes that women with lower health literacy may lack the skills to evaluate the quality of information and are particularly at risk of being misled by inaccurate online advice. These women may not be aware of their health and thus seek information online, only to fall victim to misleading websites.

It is emphasized that, while online resources are convenient, direct counseling from healthcare professionals, such as midwives and dietitians, remains the most reliable source of nutrition guidance during pregnancy.

Online information is often inaccurate and unsupported by evidence. Other problems include the lack of ascribed authorship, potential conflicts of interest, and outdated information.

“Since internet-based information is the most accessible, reliable evidence should be provided to protect everyone from misinformation, including shallow health literacy demographics, and potential physical and psychological harm.” This suggests that health officials and policymakers should establish more rigorous standards for online information sources.

The study also highlights that search engine algorithms may introduce bias, as even searches conducted in incognito mode can be influenced by factors such as IP address, device fingerprinting, and market trends. This means that search engine results may not always reflect the most neutral or reliable sources of information.

The use of QUEST for pregnancy nutrition information could be limited by its ability to identify the user, thus failing to reflect diverse content. The Google algorithm provides the most market-friendly or generally accepted viewpoints. Future studies may obtain more neutral results by using VPNs, adjusting search terms, removing identifying details from the platform, or using multiple search engines.

The study also notes that the QUEST tool, though validated, may not fully capture all aspects of quality or diversity in online health information.

We have all heard of antibodies – proteins produced by our bodies to bind to viruses or bacteria, marking them for elimination by the immune system. But not all of us are familiar with aptamers: short segments of DNA or RNA that are designed to bind, like antibodies, to specific targets. Synthetic and inexpensive to produce, aptamers are attractive alternatives to antibodies for biomedical diagnostics and therapeutics.

When new aptamer binders are needed, for example to detect a new virus, they are developed from libraries of millions of nucleic acid sequences from which the best matches for a given target are selected and amplified. Until now, such libraries contained only monovalent binders: sequences that bind to one site on a target molecule. But this contrasts with the structure of many real-world proteins, including the SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and HIV spike proteins. These structures, which viruses use to infect cells, are comprised of three identical subunits presenting three potential binding sites.

Unfortunately, using monovalent binders for these three-unit (trimeric) complexes is hit-or-miss. In fact, Maartje Bastings, head of the Programmable Biomaterials Lab in EPFL's School of Engineering, compares it to ""throwing a bowl of spaghetti at the wall, as something will certainly stick somewhere.""

You can't control where a monovalent binder interacts with its target: for example, it may bind to the side of a protein, rather than the binding interface, reducing its functionality. In other words, you can't choose the spot on the wall where a certain spaghetti noodle will stick. So, we thought: wouldn't it be better or pre-organize our library for binders that fit a target's exact geometry? And this approach turns out to be magically effective.""

Maartje Bastings, Head of the Programmable Biomaterials Lab in EPFL's School of Engineering

Bastings and her team have recently reported the first technique for producing multimeric aptamers, which target protein complexes with unprecedented precision and functionality. Indeed, the binders developed with the lab's approach, dubbed MEDUSA (Multivalent Evolved DNA-based SUpramolecular Assemblies), yields binding affinities that are between 10 and 1,000 times stronger than those achieved with monovalent binders. In addition to being stronger, they also turned out to be much more selective, which is critical for diagnostics. The research has been published in Nature Nanotechnology.

The key to developing trimeric binders is the scaffold: a molecular structure around which three binding units naturally assemble. In their experiments, the researchers developed their scaffold based on the geometry of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. By adding these tailored scaffolds to their aptamer library, the team was able to bias the sequence space toward trimeric candidates that would bind functionally to the target interface right from the start.

""We have retro-engineered the natural paradigm seen in viruses, in which multivalent molecular complexes co-evolve, and translated it into a new binder discovery method that allows us to select multivalent binders that can block such viruses,"" summarizes PhD student and first author Artem Kononenko.

Once a first batch of binders is identified, candidates with increasing affinity for their target are developed through an iterative process of selection and amplification called 'evolution'.

Although designing new scaffolds can take a matter of hours, the evolution process can take weeks. Looking ahead, the research team aims to shorten this timeframe to better suit the needs of biomedical diagnostics and therapeutics.

Another goal is to develop multimeric binders targeting pathogens with even more complex configurations, like Dengue fever (six binding subunits) or anthrax (seven). ""Ultimately, we want to use this new multivalent sequence space to train generative artificial intelligence models to do this for us,"" Bastings says.

A combination of facial thermal imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) can accurately predict the presence of coronary artery disease, finds research published in the open access journal BMJ Health & Care Informatics.

This non-invasive real-time approach is more effective than conventional methods and could be adopted for clinical practice to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and workflow, pending testing on larger and more ethnically diverse numbers of patients, suggest the researchers.

Current guidelines for the diagnosis of coronary heart disease rely on probability assessment of risk factors which aren't always very accurate or widely applicable, say the researchers. 

And while these can be supplemented with other diagnostics, such as ECG readings, angiograms, and blood tests, these are often time consuming and invasive, they add.

Thermal imaging, which captures temperature distribution and variations on the object's surface by detecting the infrared radiation emitted by that object, is non-invasive. 

And it has emerged as a promising tool for disease assessment as it can identify areas of abnormal blood circulation and inflammation from skin temperature patterns.

The advent of machine learning technology (AI), with its capacity to extract, process, and integrate complex information, might enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of thermal imaging diagnostics.

The researchers therefore set out to look into the feasibility of using thermal imaging plus AI to accurately predict the presence of coronary artery disease without the need for invasive, time consuming techniques in 460 people with suspected heart disease.Their average age was 58; 126 (27.5%) of them were women. 

Thermal images of their faces were captured before confirmatory examinations to develop and validate an AI assisted imaging model for detecting coronary artery disease.

In all, 322 participants (70%) were confirmed to have coronary artery disease. These people tended to be older and they were more likely to be men. They were also more likely to have lifestyle, clinical, and biochemical risk factors, as well as higher use of preventive meds.

The thermal imaging plus AI approach was around 13% better at predicting coronary artery disease than the pre-test risk assessment involving traditional risk factors and clinical signs and symptoms.

Among the three most significant predictive thermal indicators, the most influential was the overall left-right temperature difference of the face, followed by the maximal facial temperature, and average facial temperature.

And, specifically, the average temperature of the left jaw region was the strongest predictive feature, followed by the temperature range of the right eye region and the left-right temperature difference of the left temple regions.

 The approach also effectively identified traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease: high cholesterol; male sex; smoking; excess weight (BMI); fasting blood glucose, as well as indicators of inflammation.

The researchers acknowledge the relatively small sample size of their study and the fact that it was carried out at only one centre. And the study participants had all been referred for confirmatory tests for suspected heart disease.

But they nevertheless write: ""The feasibility of thermal imaging based coronary artery disease prediction suggests potential future applications and research opportunities.""

They add: ""As a biophysiological-based health assessment modality, it provides disease-relevant Information beyond traditional clinical measures that could enhance atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease] and related chronic condition assessment. 

""The non-contact, real-time nature of it allows for instant disease assessment at the point of care, which could streamline clinical workflows and save time for important physician-patient decision-making. In addition, it has the potential to enable mass prescreening.""

And they conclude: ""Our developed thermal imaging prediction models, based on advanced [machine learning] technology, have exhibited promising potential compared with the current conventional clinical tools.

""Further investigations incorporating larger sample sizes and diverse patient populations are needed to validate the external validity and generalisability of the current findings.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Alcohol and cabin pressure may harm heart health during flights","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250606/Alcohol-and-cabin-pressure-may-harm-heart-health-during-flights.aspx","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 13:38:00 GMT","

The combination of alcohol plus cabin pressure at cruising altitude may threaten sleeping plane passengers' heart health, particularly on long haul flights, suggests the first study of its kind, published online in the respiratory journal Thorax.

The duo lowers the amount of oxygen in the blood (SpO2) and raises the heart rate for a protracted period, even in the young and healthy, the findings indicate.

The higher the alcohol consumption, the greater these effects might be, particularly among older passengers and those with pre-existing medical conditions, say the researchers, who suggest that it may now be time to consider restricting on-board access to alcohol on long haul flights.

Atmospheric pressure decreases exponentially with altitude, causing a drop in blood oxygen saturation level to around 90% (73 hPa) in healthy passengers at cruising altitude, explain the researchers.

A further drop in SpO2 below this threshold is defined as hypobaric hypoxia—or low blood oxygen level at higher altitude.

Alcohol relaxes blood vessel walls, increasing the heart rate during sleep, an effect similar to that of hypobaric hypoxia, so the researchers wanted to find out if the combination of alcohol plus cabin pressure at cruising altitude might have an additive effect on sleeping passengers.

They therefore randomly allocated 48 people between the ages of 18 and 40 to two groups stratified by age, gender, and weight (BMI). Half were assigned to a sleep lab under normal ambient air pressure conditions (sea level) and half to an altitude chamber that mimicked cabin pressure at cruising altitude (2438 m above sea level).

Twelve people in each group slept for 4 hours having drunk no alcohol, while 12 slept for 4 hours having drunk alcohol for 1 night, followed by 2 recovery nights, and then a further night in which the process was reversed.

Participants drank the equivalent of 2 cans of beer (5%) or 2 glasses of wine (175 ml, 12%) in pure vodka at 11.15 pm, and their sleep cycle, SpO2, and heart rate were monitored continuously until 4 am. 

The final analysis included the results of 23 people in the sleep lab and 17 in the altitude chamber.

This showed that the combination of alcohol and simulated cabin pressure at cruising altitude prompted a fall in SpO2 to an average of just over 85%  and a compensatory increase in heart rate to an average of nearly 88 beats/minute during sleep. 

This compares with just over 88% SpO2 and just under 73 beats/minute among those sleeping in the altitude chamber who had not drunk alcohol.

Among those in the sleep lab who drank alcohol the equivalent figures were just under 95% SpO2,  and just under 77 bpm heart rate and just under 96% and just under 64 bpm for those who hadn't.

Oxygen levels below the healthy clinical norm (90%) lasted for 201 minutes with the combination of alcohol plus simulated cabin pressure at cruising altitude. This compares with a period lasting 173 minutes without alcohol and 0 minutes with and without alcohol under sleep lab conditions. 

Deepest sleep (N3 stage of the sleep cycle) was reduced to 46.5 minutes under the combined exposure of alcohol and simulated cabin pressure at cruising altitude compared with both sleep lab conditions: after alcohol: 84 minutes; without alcohol 67.5 minutes.

The period of REM sleep was also shorter among those exposed to hypobaric hypoxia and alcohol. Both N3 and REM sleep are important phases of the recuperative stages of sleep.

The researchers acknowledge the small sample size of their study and that the participants were young and healthy so don't reflect the general population.

What's more, participants slept in the supine position, a luxury usually only afforded to those flying first class, so the findings might not equally apply to the bulk of plane passengers who fly economy, they add. 

Nevertheless, they state: ""Together these results indicate that, even in young and healthy individuals, the combination of alcohol intake with sleeping under hypobaric conditions poses a considerable strain on the cardiac system and might lead to exacerbation of symptoms in patients with cardiac or pulmonary diseases.""  

These effects might be even greater in older people, they suggest, adding: ""Cardiovascular symptoms have a prevalence of 7% of inflight medical emergencies, with cardiac arrest causing 58% of aircraft diversions."" 

And they conclude: ""Practitioners, passengers and crew should be informed about the potential risks, and it may be beneficial to consider altering regulations to restrict the access to alcoholic beverages on board aeroplanes.""

With the launch of the NIBN Japan Microbiome Database, scientists gain an unprecedented window into how lifestyle and diet shape our microbiome and influence long-term health.

Research: NIBN Japan Microbiome Database, a database for exploring the correlations between human microbiome and health. ​​​​​​​Image Credit: Shutterstock

In a recent study published in Scientific Reports, researchers introduced the NIBN Japan Microbiome Database (NIBN JMD), an extensive, publicly available database of diverse, healthy human microbiome profiles (comprising more than 2,000 microbiome samples) annotated with up to 1,000 metadata points per sample, as well as longitudinal study outcomes.

The database aims to facilitate and progress future microbiome association studies and medical research by providing researchers with an exhaustive baseline dataset against which gut microbiome impacts and causal associations can be compared, paving the way for microbiome-associated chronic disease and lifestyle interventions. This article describes the NIBN JMD database, its features, and potential applications.

Samples came from nine distinct locations across six Japanese prefectures, including urban centers like Tokyo and Osaka alongside rural areas like Minamiuonuma, enhancing regional diversity.

A growing body of research underscores the importance of the human gut microbiome in shaping host health and disease. Studies have established a strong bidirectional association between gut microbiome features (the composition and relative densities of gut flora) and clinical outcomes, including obesity, infections, inflammation, and even cancers.

While substantial advances in next-generation sequencing technologies (including genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics) have provided scientists with unprecedented amounts of microbiome data, existing datasets suffer from the common demerits of inadequate metadata and contextual annotation. Furthermore, conventional databases provide summary statistics computed by aggregating data from multiple studies, but they fail to account for inter-study methodological differences.

These demerits severely hinder generalizable, large-scale investigations of microbiome-health interactions, thereby preventing the discovery and deployment of interventions against a broad spectrum of diets, lifestyles, and diseases. This necessitates the development of a standardized human microbiome database comprising both diverse sequencing data and thorough metadata annotation, which would facilitate leveraging the gut microbiome's full potential in mitigating human disease and promoting global well-being.

Researchers used a custom pipeline called ""Snaq"" for 16S data analysis, which incorporated specific quality thresholds (bbduk trimming) and SILVA database version 138 for taxonomy.

The National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health, and Nutrition (NIBN, formerly NIBIOHN) is a Japanese collaborative research effort between the National Institute of Biomedical Innovation (NIBIO) and the National Institute of Health and Nutrition (NIHN). Established in 2005, the organization aims to advance biomedical innovation, nutrition, and pharmaceutical output of the Japanese population.

NIBN recognized gaps in current human microbiome databases and addressed this by collating fecal samples and extensive metadata from both its own extensive research network and multiple collaborators to generate one of the largest human microbiome datasets in existence. Named the 'NIBN Japan Microbiome Database (NIBN JMD)', this novel database, which is publicly accessible with some restrictions, aims to unleash the human gut microbiome's true clinical potential through unprecedented metadata annotation and a self-updating design.

The database currently comprises 2,273 microbiome samples from 2,068 subjects, each of which is linked to up to 1,000 metadata points, encompassing participant demographics, diets, lifestyles, physical activity levels, and medical histories. While all samples have basic metadata, the level of detail depends on the specific cohort. The database also includes collaborator-derived longitudinal samples, enabling analyses of temporal microbiome dynamics. Notably, all data processing adhered to standardized protocols to maintain consistency and reliability across a diverse array of samples.

Age data was carefully grouped into ranges for anonymity, ensuring at least five participants per group, categorized separately by gender and cohort.

Researchers utilized a Snakemake pipeline for QIIME2, called 'Snaq', to process 16S rRNA sequencing data, while separate in-house pipelines were employed for shotgun metagenomic data. The latter pipelines include provisions for automation of NCBI-compliant taxonomic assignment (Kraken 2, Bracken, and MetaPhlAn), functional profiling (FMAP), and metadata annotation. The paper notes that while shotgun sequencing has been performed, the full analysis results will be available in a future version of the database.

NIBN JMD was built on a custom implementation of the MANTA platform, providing researchers with a spectrum of in-built multifactorial analysis tools capable of visualizing microbiome-health associations and exploring correlations within the data. Researchers also developed an in-house script to automate the importing and processing of data from new and future samples.

Most importantly, NIBN JMD represents a rich, well-structured dataset that is architecturally focused on user-friendly access and capable of integration with most gold-standard analytical tools. Its public-facing interface supports open science and hopes to revolutionize future collaborative microbiome studies. While basic data is openly available, access to more extensive metadata requires a collaborative agreement and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, ensuring the ethical handling of data.

NIBN JMD represents a significant advancement in microbiome research infrastructure, providing scientists with a richly annotated, publicly accessible resource —one of the largest and most comprehensive of its kind. It complements other global resources with its high consistency and interactive analysis tools. This database has the potential to accelerate discoveries in microbiome science, inform personalized health strategies, and expedite the development of interventions that leverage the microbiome.

It has already been applied in studies that have established associations between gut microbiota and factors such as dietary patterns (including barley and vitamin B1 intake), bowel habits, and metabolic conditions like obesity and type 2 diabetes. While its current restriction to only Japanese participants restricts its global generalizability, it presents the first step towards a healthier tomorrow.

Scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have found that levels of circulating taurine, a conditionally essential amino acid involved in multiple important biological functions, is unlikely to serve as a good biomarker for the aging process. In blood samples from humans, monkeys, and mice, scientists found that circulating taurine levels often increased or remained constant with age. Analysis of longitudinal data showed that within individual differences in taurine levels often exceeded age-related changes. Researchers also found that taurine levels were inconsistently associated with health outcomes across age, species, and cohorts, suggesting that declining taurine is not a universal marker of aging. Instead, its impact may depend on individual physiological contexts shaped by genetic, nutritional, and environmental factors. Results are published in Science.

Taurine recently gained popularity as dietary supplement due to recent research that found supplementation with taurine improved multiple age-related traits and extended lifespan in model organisms (worms and mice). However, there is no solid clinical data that shows its supplementation benefits humans.

A recent research article on taurine led us to evaluate this molecule as a potential biomarker of aging in multiple species.""

Rafael de Cabo, Ph.D., study co-author and chief of the Translational Gerontology Branch at NIH's National Institute on Aging (NIA)

Researchers measured taurine concentration in longitudinally collected blood from participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (aged 26-100), rhesus monkeys (aged 3-32 years) and mice (aged 9-27 months). Taurine concentrations increased with age in all groups, except in male mice in which taurine remained unchanged. Similar age-related changes in taurine concentrations were observed in two cross-sectional studies of geographically distinct human populations, the Balearic Islands Study of Aging (aged 20-85) from the Balearic region of Mallorca, and the Predictive Medicine Research cohort (aged 20-68) from Atlanta, Georgia, as well as in the cross-sectional arm of the Study of Longitudinal Aging in Mice.

""We used longitudinal, cross-species data across the lifespan under normal conditions aimed to clarify how taurine levels change with age as a biomarker for aging, a key advance for aging research"" added Maria Emilia Fernandez, Ph.D., study co-author and postdoctoral fellow of the Translational Gerontology Branch at NIA. 

Researchers also found that the relation between taurine and muscle strength or body weight was inconsistent. For example, analyses of gross motor function highlight the limitations of considering solely circulating taurine changes as indicative of biological aging, as comparatively low motor function performance can be associated either with high or low concentrations of taurine, whereas in other cases, no relation at all is found between these variables.

""Identifying reliable biomarkers to predict the onset and progression of aging and functional decline would be a major breakthrough, enabling more effective, personalized strategies to maintain health and independence into old age"", emphasized Luigi Ferrucci, M.D., Ph.D. study co-author and scientific director at NIA.

This study was funded by the in-house research program at NIH's National Institute on Aging.

Nearly one-third of people who adopted and adhered to a healthy diet did not lose any weight, but still reaped many health benefits, according to a new study led by researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Ben Gurion University, Israel. Independent of weight reduction, study participants showed significant improvements in cardiometabolic markers, including higher HDL cholesterol (the healthy type of cholesterol), lower levels of leptin (the hormone that signals hunger), and less visceral fat (belly fat found deep inside the abdominal cavity, sometimes wrapping around organs).

We have been conditioned to equate weight loss with health, and weight loss-resistant individuals are often labeled as failures. Our findings reframe how we define clinical success. People who do not lose weight can improve their metabolism and reduce their long-term risk for disease. That's a message of hope, not failure.""

Anat Yaskolka Meir, lead author, postdoctoral research fellow, Department of Epidemiology at Harvard Chan School

The study will be published June 5 in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.

The researchers analyzed changes in weight and health among 761 individuals with abdominal obesity in Israel who participated in three landmark workplace-based nutrition clinical trials (DIRECT, CENTRAL, and DIRECT-PLUS) with high adherence rates and comprehensive metabolic profiling. At each trial, participants were randomly assigned to adopt and adhere to healthy diets-including low-fat, low-carbohydrate, Mediterranean, and green-Mediterranean diets-for between 18 and 24 months.

The study found that, across all of the clinical trials and all of the diets, 36% of participants achieved clinically significant weight loss (defined as losing more than 5% of their initial body weight); 36% achieved moderate weight loss (losing up to 5% of their initial body weight); and 28% were resistant to weight loss, losing no weight or gaining some. Weight loss was associated with a variety of health improvements: The researchers calculated that each kilogram lost was associated with a 1.44% increase in HDL cholesterol, a 1.37% decrease in triglycerides, a 2.46% drop in insulin, a 2.79% drop in leptin, and a 0.49-unit reduction in liver fat, along with reductions in blood pressure and liver enzymes.

The study also found, however, that participants who were resistant to weight change-who tended to be older and/or women-showed many of the same improvements. They had more good cholesterol; lower levels of leptin, leading to less hunger; and less harmful visceral fat.

""These are deep metabolic shifts with real cardiometabolic consequences,"" said Yaskolka Meir. ""Our study showed that a healthy diet works, even when weight doesn't shift.""

The researchers also utilized cutting-edge omics tools and discovered 12 specific DNA methylation sites that strongly predict long-term weight loss.

""This novel finding shows that some people may be biologically wired to respond differently to the same diet,"" said corresponding author Iris Shai, principal investigator of the nutrition trials and adjunct professor of nutrition at Harvard Chan School. ""This isn't just about willpower or discipline-it's about biology. And now we're getting close to understanding it.""

The study had some limitations, namely that the majority of participants were men. The researchers noted that future similar studies should focus on women.

Other Harvard Chan co-authors included Lu Qi, Dong Wang, Liming Liang, Frank Hu, and Meir Stampfer.

The study was funded by the German Research Foundation (project 209933838).

Over the weekend, the U.S. women's national team cruised to a 3-0 win over China on goals by Catarina Macario, Sam Coffey and captain Lindsey Heaps. The Americans out-shot their opponent 18-4, including 7-2 in shots on goal.

Highlights included goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce earning her second cap and second clean sheet for the senior squad, Kansas City Current captain Lo'eau LaBonta becoming the oldest player in USWNT history to earn her first cap at age 32, and Naomi Girma playing a full 90 minutes in her first U.S. match this calendar year.

The USWNT returns to the pitch Tuesday night in St. Louis when it faces Jamaica in another friendly to end this camp window. On Monday, manager Emma Hayes said to expect lineup changes.

""At this moment in time I'm interested in developing experiences for the individuals, but within a framework that we want our players to work towards,"" Hayes said. ""Nothing has changed in terms of our objectives. There will be changes tomorrow and I'm taking this camp and next camp to do all of those things.

""The things we need to dial up in this next performance are one, things we'll work on in training and two, we'll work on in the classroom when we go back. And I look forward to seeing how our team achieves that, not just the starting group, but the group that comes in. Because I want to make sure that whether you start, whether you come into the game, it shouldn't alter our level. If anything, we should keep finding other levels in us.""

Subs we could see may include giving first caps to Seattle Reign goalkeeper Claudia Dickey and defender Kerry Abello as Hayes looks to continue widening her talent pool ahead of the 2027 World Cup.

U23s split matches in Germany

The USWNT U23 squad recently played two games in Germany and split the results. Hayes was able to watch both matches and said she was pleased with the progress that age group is making as it pertains to the development of younger players that could positively impact the senior team in the future.

""Two tremendous games,"" Hayes said. ""The exposures we got for our players playing a top German team that also had five overage players, I never once looked at that game and thought anybody was out of place there, which is a starting point.

""This is why Germany and England and Spain, on many levels, have taken leaps in the right direction. Because they've had a U23s program, and programming at U20s and U17s, that has been above the volume we've been doing in the U.S. So addressing that balance is critical for future success and these two games will, I think, be pivotal for the success of these players, whether they'll be eligible for [the 2027 World Cup, the 2028 Olympics and/or the 2031 World Cup].""

USWNT-USMNT joint camp?

While the USWNT prepares for a match in St. Louis, the USMNT is training about 300 miles north in Chicago as it readies itself for pre-Gold Cup friendlies against Turkiye (June 7) and Switzerland (June 10). 

It's not often that the two senior teams train at the same time. So Hayes was asked if she'd ever consider having a joint camp with the men's side and if anything could be gained from doing so. Hayes and USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino are close friends, and Pochettino has said in the past that his team can take inspiration from the USWNT's success as it prepares for the 2026 World Cup.

""To be honest with you, it's not on my radar,"" Hayes said, noting that the USWNT's schedule is mostly planned out between now and the 2027 World Cup and that it can be a tricky matrix to determine who and where and when the team is playing. 

However, with the U.S. Soccer National Training Center in Atlanta expected to open in spring 2026, those opportunities to train at the same time could very well ""arise more organically,"" Hayes said.

""But of course, it has to be in line with where our games are and things like that,"" she added. ""Yes is the bottom line, but not an easy answer to answer based on all [those] factors.""

Sandy Baltimore fires home her second goal during Chelsea's 3-0 victory over Manchester United to win the Women's FA Cup final. (0:45)

United States women's national team forward Mia Fishel is in discussions with multiple NWSL teams about a summer transfer away from Chelsea, a source told ESPN.

Fishel, 24, is in search of a summer move to become the focal point of an NWSL's team's forward line with an eye toward earning more USWNT caps ahead of the 2027 World Cup.

She has three caps for the USWNT and scored her lone senior international goal to date in her second match for the USWNT, in 2023.

Her time with the USWNT has been limited due to a torn ACL sustained while training with the team ahead of the 2024 Concacaf W Gold Cup.

Fishel recently returned to the field for Chelsea and spent the past international break as one of the overage players with the USWNT under-23s for a pair of games against Germany's U-23s.

""Yes, she could come in, sit on the bench for [the senior team], but it's much better for her to go and play in Germany and get the experiences so that these players are tracking to compete in the place that we want them to come 2027,"" USWNT head coach Emma Hayes said last month.

Chelsea already has a crowded roster that includes fellow USWNT forward Catarina Macario and Colombian Mayra Ramírez, who joined Chelsea on a then-record transfer fee in early 2024.

Australian forward Sam Kerr, twice the league's top scorer in recent years, is also due back from a long-term knee injury.

Hayes was the coach at Chelsea when the team acquired Fishel from Liga MX Femenil powerhouse Tigres in 2023 for a $250,000 transfer fee.

Tigres signed Fishel out of college in 2022 and the striker made an immediate impact. She was the league's top scorer in the 2022 Apertura (fall) season with 17 goals as Tigres won the title, and she added another 13 goals in the 2023 Clausura (spring) before her move to Chelsea.

Fishel was initially drafted fifth overall in the 2022 NWSL Draft by the Orlando Pride after leaving UCLA a year early, but she declined to sign with Orlando, choosing instead to go to Tigres in Mexico.

Orlando had just hired former UCLA head coach Amanda Cromwell to be the Pride's head coach, although Cromwell was suspended early in that 2022 NWSL season and eventually terminated for alleged retaliation and violations of the league's workplace discrimination policies.

""When I got drafted, it wasn't necessarily the choice I wanted,"" Fishel told Andscape in 2023. ""If I didn't go to Tigres in Mexico, I have no doubt that I would not be at Chelsea now.

""I strongly believe in that.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Top soccer leagues from around the world have completed their seasons. June is upon us, and the finals in the NBA and NHL are underway.

That means the annual “Summer of Soccer” is almost here, as European clubs arrive on our soil for preseason matches at regular-season prices. It's nearly time for domestic and international tournaments, MLS and NWSL meandering through the dog days, and the U.S. national teams taking stock.

There's enough action to make the head swivel, but give credit to the sport's governing bodies — only soccer can devise a schedule that pits the men's national team's participation in the CONCACAF Gold Cup against the redesigned and not-trying-to-hide-the-greed FIFA Club World Cup.

That's right: Two high-level tournaments will be competing simultaneously as a precursor to the 2026 World Cup hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico — assuming they are still talking to each other.

The Gold Cup, comprising 15 teams from CONCACAF (North and Central America and the Caribbean) and invited guest Saudi Arabia, will run from June 14 to July 6. The 32-team Club World Cup takes place June 14 to July 13. When it was last held in 2023, Manchester City won the seven-team club tourney.

Obviously, now with Lionel Messi playing for Inter Miami and big-time teams such as current UEFA Champions League winner Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Inter Milan, Manchester City and Real Madrid, the focus will be on the Club World Cup as opposed to, say, Trinidad and Tobago playing Haiti.

The Club World Cup has its detractors.

Players outside of MLS are giving up their already short offseason, compared to the scaled-back tournament being held in-season as in the past. Meanwhile, The Athletic this week reported that ticket sales are lagging, and players for the Seattle Sounders of MLS last weekend protested that a bigger share of the winnings should go directly to them and not the clubs.

It could be an ominous sign, but the real drama will be at the Gold Cup — and the possibility of a “Summer of Suck” for the U.S.

Enthusiasm for the boys in red, white and blue hasn't been this low since failing to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. Since then, this so-called “Golden Generation” has teased success — like advancing out of the group stage of the 2022 World Cup — but the aftermath has been one long slide into irrelevance.

It's a sad state when the men are the third-most popular national team in this country, behind the juggernaut U.S. women and Mexico's men's squad.

It was almost 11 months ago that Gregg Berhalter was canned by U.S. Soccer after failing to get out of the group stage of Copa América, but new coach Mauricio Pochettino hasn't found success. A loss to Panama in the semifinal of the CONCACAF Nations League in March was embarrassing.

The problem is, the Gold Cup represents the last competitive matches for the U.S. until the 2026 World Cup begins in 53 weeks.

Yet Pochettino will be shorthanded. Weston McKennie and Tim Weah (Juventus) and Gio Reyna (Borussia Dortmund) will be at the Club World Cup, while Sergiño Dest, Antonee Robinson and Folarin Balogun are among many recovering from injuries.

The biggest star of them all, Christian Pulisic, opted out after playing more than 50 matches in each of the past two seasons. No one can begrudge him for wanting to rest — he's been carrying the program on his back for years — but it's still a bad look. If he doesn't care about the Gold Cup, why should we?

On a positive note, a crop of newcomers may inject the kind of spirit and heart that has been lacking. Brian White and Berhalter's son Sebastian, both of the Vancouver Whitecaps, and Real Salt Lake's Diego Luna are part of a hungry group that at the very least should push the veterans who have forgotten that playing for the U.S. is earned, not given.

One needs only to look at the U.S. women. After the 2023 World Cup debacle, new coach Emma Hayes discarded the old guard and developed a program to her liking. By the 2027 Women's World Cup, the Americans' second unit will likely be as good as all but four or five of the other top teams in the world.

Unfortunately for Pochettino, he doesn't have that much time, and the U.S. soccer community is looking for any flicker of hope heading into next year's World Cup.

Howard “Hopalong” Cassady, the 1955 Heisman Trophy winner for Ohio State, once said, “Potential is somebody who hasn't done anything.”

The U.S. men's national team has a lot of potential. We're still waiting for them to do something with it.

The U.S. men's national team will prepare for the Gold Cup with friendlies Saturday against Turkey and Tuesday against Switzerland.

A U.S. men's national soccer team already missing several notable players for the Concacaf Gold Cup lost another key figure Thursday when Sergiño Dest was ruled out so he can continue his comeback from ACL surgery.

The dynamic right back recovered from the injury this spring and resumed playing for Dutch club PSV Eindhoven. But after several days at U.S. training camp, Dest and the national team staff decided he was not ready for a long-term competition.

“We determined the best decision is for the player to have an individualized training program for the summer so he can focus on being fully recovered and ready to perform next season,” Coach Mauricio Pochettino said in a statement.

Dest is the sixth player from the camp roster to fall out of contention for the Gold Cup — the U.S. team's last tournament before the 2026 World Cup.

Goalkeeper Zack Steffen, who was primed to compete for the starting job, withdrew Wednesday with a knee injury. Previously, goalkeeper Patrick Schulte, forward Folarin Balogun and defenders DeJuan Jones and Sean Zawadzki were scratched.

Even before naming the camp roster May 22, Pochettino left off several players who were injured, requested time away following the European club seasons or are unavailable because of the Club World Cup this summer. That group included Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Gio Reyna and Yunus Musah.

On Thursday, Pochettino finalized his 26-man Gold Cup roster with 14 players who have made four or fewer U.S. appearances, including seven with none.

Four players received their first invitations to U.S. camp: defender Alex Freeman, midfielders Quinn Sullivan and Sebastian Berhalter, and forward Damion Downs.

The roster averages 16 international appearances.

John Tolkin, a former New York Red Bulls standout now with Holstein Kiel in Germany, replaced Dest.

“Of course, our priority is to win the tournament and to show the right mentality and approach,” Pochettino said, “and we are confident these players will take advantage of the opportunity.”

The U.S. team will prepare for the Gold Cup with friendlies Saturday against Turkey in East Hartford, Connecticut, and Tuesday against Switzerland in Nashville.

In the Gold Cup group stage, the Americans will play Trinidad & Tobago on June 15 in San Jose, Saudi Arabia on June 19 in Austin and Haiti on June 22 in Arlington, Texas. Mexico and Canada are the other tournament favorites.

Awful Announcing

One of the biggest stars American soccer has ever produced is joining one of the sport's most prominent media companies.

Former U.S. Men's National Team (USMNT) star Clint Dempsey is set to join Men in Blazers, the company announced on Thursday. The deal is described as a multi-year agreement and will see Dempsey serve as the lead analyst for Men in Blazers' USMNT coverage, according to the Sports Business Journal. Dempsey will also host a brand new show called The Deuce, an homage to his nickname and jersey number.

Per SBJ, “Dempsey will provide analysis and commentary before, during, and after games, including previews for the 2026 men's World Cup.” On Saturday, Dempsey will co-host the Men in Blazers altcast on TNT alongside the company's founder, Roger Bennett, during the USMNT-Türkiye friendly.

Since retiring from playing in 2018, Dempsey has become a prominent television analyst during coverage of USMNT games. He is most notable for serving as an analyst for Fox's World Cup studio coverage in 2022. The American has also made frequent appearances on CBS's various soccer properties, including USMNT matches in the CONCACAF Nations League.

There are few former USMNT players as recognizable as Clint Dempsey, and almost all of them have carved out solid second acts in the media. Landon Donovan currently works as an analyst for Fox Sports, and Tim Howard is a fixture on NBC's Premier League coverage.

...

INGLEWOOD, Calif. — After Thursday's stunning loss to Panama, the U.S. men's national team promised a response. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino assured fuming fans that a sleepy CONCACAF Nations League semifinal “didn't describe, or doesn't describe, how we are.” Players said they'd “look in the mirror” and “raise the bar.” And yet, in Sunday's third-place match against Canada, they did none of that.

They lost 2-1 to their northern neighbors, and deserved every last ounce of the defeat.

They managed one solitary shot on goal over the game's first 84 minutes.

In the face of criticism and doubts, they talked about how, “if we want to be praised, we have to give people something to praise us about,” as midfielder Tyler Adams said Saturday. Instead, they regressed, and further disillusioned their supporters, and inflamed doubts about their readiness for a World Cup on home soil next summer.

All involved promised that, after the 1-0 loss to Panama, Sunday's performance would be better. This Nations League consolation match would “be an important game to see how we react,” Pochettino said Saturday.

“Mentality obviously needs to change,” Adams said hours later.

“We're gonna come out with that fighting spirit,” Tim Weah added.

In the interim, they had one-on-one talks and a “beautiful meeting,” Weah said, in which Pochettino pleaded for “killer mentality” and more. The message, Weah said: “We have to want it. We have to want to be here 100%. We have to fight.”

But on Sunday, they floundered. For most of the first half, they didn't take the risks nor show the “aggression” they said they would. In a stadium that was once again nine-tenths empty at kickoff, they played dull soccer, and conceded a 27th-minute goal before they'd even taken a shot of their own.

Soon thereafter, Diego Luna tried to inject life into the USMNT, and into another snoozefest. Playing in his first competitive match for the national team, he started an attacking move from the right side of midfield, and, with a driving off-ball run, propelled it into the penalty box. It was the exact type of initiative that the U.S. lacked Thursday — and has often lacked under multiple managers.

""The desire and the hunger that he showed is what we want,"" Pochettino said postgame.

At the end of his run, Luna received a pass in stride. He poked a clever square ball to Patrick Agyemang, who equalized with a firm finish.

The two Major League Soccer attackers, two of five changes to the U.S. starting lineup, seemed to lift a lagging team back into the game.

Neither, though, could erase the mediocrity around them. Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, the team's two Italy-based stars, were quiet. Adams and Weah looked nothing like their typically active selves. The USMNT was once against stagnant. Why?

""I think we need to have every single person buy into exactly what we're doing and what we're trying to do,"" Adams said postgame. ""It's just the little things ... duels, tackles, leaving your mark on the field, not being naive in certain moments, being a little bit more clever — all the details of the game that, I feel like, when I watch people play with their clubs, we do. And then when we come here, sometimes I think we forget a little bit what the games are gonna give us.""

Not long after halftime, they receded again. They nearly conceded two penalties. (Canada head coach Jesse Marsch was red carded for protesting one of the no-calls.) Then, in the 59th minute, they conceded again. Jonathan David put Canada up 2-1.

And that's how it ended, just as a friendly between these two teams ended in September, with the U.S. beaten — and with all sorts of questions swirling about the talent, passion, ceiling and capabilities of these U.S. players.

It ended with Pochettino ""disappointed,"" again, and reaching for reasons that the medium-term future, in 2026, could still be bright.

""I want to send the message to the fans: Don't be pessimistic,"" Pochettino said.

But he couldn't offer clear rationale for why they shouldn't be, other than: ""In football, anything can happen.""

And as he rose to depart his postgame press conference, he apologized to everyone present, saying that he felt ""shame"" after the two losses, and promising, again, that ""next time"" would be different.

Later, as Pochettino slumped in his shotgun seat on the team bus, Adams was asked whether he, like fans, is concerned one year out from the World Cup.

""I'm never concerned, man. It's football,"" he said. ""You gotta show up in big moments, when the moments matter. We didn't show up in this window here. We've showed up in the past, in moments when we needed to.""","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Patrick Agyemang was playing Division III college soccer the last time the U.S. men's national team sent anything resembling a first-choice squad to the Concacaf Gold Cup.

It was the summer of 2019, and Agyemang was about to enter his second season at tiny Eastern Connecticut State University, a 30-minute drive from his hometown of East Hartford. His goal of becoming a professional soccer player — let alone a legitimate candidate for the USMNT's 2026 World Cup squad — was a distant dream for the then-19-year-old striker.

""Obviously, I had doubts,"" Agyemang told FOX Sports in a recent phone interview. ""I've always had the utmost confidence in myself. But I wasn't sure. I'm playing D-III, and all I really knew was guys get drafted from Division I. Where I'm from, not many people make it in this game.""

Jump forward five years, and Agyemang is about to come full-circle. On Saturday in East Hartford, he'll likely take the field as the U.S.'s starting striker in the Americans' pre-Gold Cup friendly against Türkiye. With top forwards Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi unavailable because of injury, Agyemang figures to log big minutes in the national team's final tournament before the main event next summer. A strong showing would go a long way toward sticking around for the World Cup.

And there's no reason to think Agyemang won't have one. A towering center forward at 6-foot-4, he has succeeded at every level he's played at so far. His stellar two seasons at ECSU got him a transfer to D-I school Rhode Island. In December 2022, expansion team Charlotte FC picked him 12th overall in the MLS SuperDraft.

This winter, he earned a January camp invitation to the USMNT on the strength of his breakout 2024 MLS season, during which he had 10 goals. He then scored in January exhibitions against Venezuela and Costa Rica, which earned him a roster spot for the Nations League finals in March.

Playing alongside first-teamers like Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, Agyemang had the Americans' only goal in a 2-1 loss to Canada in the third-place game. Over what was a disastrous weekend for Mauricio Pochettino's team, the play of Agyemang and Diego Luna — who helped set up Agyemang's strike — was the lone silver lining.

""I think the confidence in him has grown,"" Luna said this week of his fellow USMNT newcomer.

""Just to feel like you're able to compete and play with these guys and contribute with a goal — it's a good feeling,"" Agyemang said. He's carried that self-belief into this camp.

""You look at a forward and you can tell when they're confident; they start taking their chances a little bit better,"" U.S. defender Walker Zimmerman said following Tuesday's training session in Chicago. ""They're more energized to make those extra runs on both sides of the ball. And that's what he's doing right now.""

Still, Agyemang has plenty of room to improve. Pochettino described him as ""raw"" in January. Privately, the Argentine has encouraged him to be cleaner on the ball, though Poch is clearly happy with his progress. He and assistant  Miguel D'Agostino even went to visit with Agyemang and veteran defender Tim Ream at Charlotte's training facility this spring.

""First touch, the first movement to get the separation between defenders — those are little things I'm definitely trying to learn,"" Agyemang said. ""They want me to believe in myself, because they see potential to keep going.""

After almost a year together in Charlotte, Ream has gotten to know Agyemang well off the field, too.

""He's got a personality,"" Ream said. ""He's not quiet or shy, he has his opinions, but he's also a sponge.

""He's trying to constantly improve and be a better player in the locker room, in video sessions, constantly asking questions,"" continued Ream, a veteran of the English Premier League and the 2022 World Cup, where he played every minute of the Americans' four games. ""That's kind of what propels you and helps you get to that next level.""

Agyemang's performances for both the national team and The Crown are generating interest from European clubs. A move overseas seems inevitable at some point, before or after the World Cup.

But before that comes Saturday. Agyemang's parents and two older brothers have yet to see him play for the U.S. in person. They'll get that opportunity just steps away from where Patrick's unlikely journey began. 

""I've always dreamed of playing in that stadium,"" said Agyemang, who has asked U.S. Soccer for 25 tickets to Saturday's match. ""That it can potentially happen this week is surreal.""

The same can be said about his journey to this point.

""To see where I've come from, even two years ago, to where I am today, that development is crazy,"" Ageymang added. 

""I just want to keep going.""

UNITED STATES MEN'S National Team head coach formally announced his 26-player roster for the 2025 Gold Cup that will open on June 15 in California. The Gold Cup team was almost entirely comprised from the players who were on the recent training camp roster along with the subsequent changes that were listed over the weekend.

But there were two notable exceptions. The first is that Sergino Dest was removed from the roster due to fitness issues that were determined during a physical evaluation. He was replaced by John Tolkin, who arrived in camp on Thursday.

“The technical, medical and high performance staffs have done a series of evaluations this week on all the players in camp, and in the case of Sergiño we determined the best decision is for the player to have an individualized training program for the summer so he can focus on being fully recovered and ready to perform next season,” Pochettino said.

Meanwhile, Pochettino added Walker Zimmerman, Nathan Harriel, and Paxten Aaronson in place of DeJuan Jones, Sean Zawadzki, and Folarin Balogun. Prior to that, Chris Brady replaced Patrick Schulte.

With that, here is the Gold Cup roster along with some thoughts.

 

GOALKEEPERS (4): Chris Brady (Chicago Fire; 0/0), Matt Freese (New York City FC; 0/0), Matt Turner (Crystal Palace/ENG; 51/0)  

DEFENDERS (9): Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew; 3/0), Alex Freeman (Orlando City; 0/0), Nathan Harriel (Philadelphia Union; 0/0), Mark McKenzie (Toulouse/FRA; 19/0), Tim Ream (Charlotte FC; 68/1), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace/ENG; 24/1), Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati; 32/3), John Tolkin (Holstein Kiel/GER; 4/0), Walker Zimmerman (Nashville SC; 43/3) 

MIDFIELDERS (9): Brenden Aaronson (Leeds United/ENG; 47/8); Tyler Adams (Bournemouth/ENG; 44/2), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps/CAN; 0/0), Johnny Cardoso (Real Betis/ESP; 18/0), Luca de la Torre (San Diego FC; 24/1), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake; 4/0), Jack McGlynn (Houston Dynamo; 4/1), Quinn Sullivan (Philadelphia Union; 0/0); Malik Tillman (PSV Eindhoven/NED; 17/0) 

FORWARDS (5): Paxten Aaronson (FC Utrecht/NED; 1/0), Patrick Agyemang (Charlotte FC; 4/3), Damion Downs (FC Köln/GER; 0/0), Brian White (Vancouver Whitecaps/CAN; 4/1), Haji Wright (Coventry City/ENG; 15/4) 

 

 

 

Many familiar faces from recent camps were left off this roster. Some were due to injuries, some were due to the Club World Cup, Christian Pulisic needed a break, and Yunus Musah withdrew due to personal reasons - but many were football decisions.

Some of those include Josh Sargent, Joe Scally, Cameron Carter-Vickers, Tanner Tessmann, Aidan Morris, Auston Trusty, Marlon Fossey, Alex Zendejas, and others.

Meanwhile, Pochettino has given a big opportunity for others to impress at this Gold Cup. If they take advantage, it could give them the inside track for being in the plans in the run-up to the World Cup.

Many of these faces would have been seen as extremely surprising as recently as the start of 2025. But players like Brian White, Sebastian Berhalter, Max Arfsten, Alex Freeman, Nathian Harriel, and Chris Brady have continued to do well and Pochettino wants to give them a chance.

That's completely fair. The U.S. team is coming off a year where it crashed out of the Copa America on home soil during the group stages and followed it up by a fourth place finish out of four teams at the Nations League (also on home soil) the bigger risk is to make few changes. The benefit for having a coach like Pochettino who comes in from the complete outside is that he sees things with fresh eyes.

When watching the Gold Cup, the right approach is to look at team as if there are very few locks. Before Pochettino arrived, most of the call-ups were assumed and this came regardless of club form. Now, it is more open and many of the newcomers over this past year are there not because of reputation but because they are playing well.

We will now see if that hunger carries over into the national team.

 

 

Aside from Chris Richards, who had a very good season for Crystal Palace, the rest of the team's central defenders all have serious questions and there is no clear pecking order.

Tim Ream is 37 and is always battling the age issue. Mark McKenzie had a good season overall in France but stumbled down the stretch. Miles Robinson has been good but unspectacular for FC Cincinnati. Walker Zimmerman now reenters the equation and is among the more consistent players but has only recently returned from a concussion.

Richards is a lock, but it is an open audition for the other four centerbacks.

 

 

No one questions that Antonee Robinson is the team's best left back. But who backs up Robinson has been an open question for years. While Ream can play left back, he seems like an unlikely option there outside of an emergency.

That leaves Max Arfsten and John Tolkin. Arfsten has been on the team all camp while Tolkin only was added when Dest was forced to withdraw. Both players should get opportunities over the coming month but Arfsten has the value having worked with Pochettino in January and March. Another good camp could put him in the drivers' seat to back up Robinson moving forward. It's there for the taking.

As for Tolkin, he showed well in the Bundesliga but after Holstein Kiel's relegation, he has to shift down to the 2.Bundesliga unless he gets sold (which didn't sound likely based on his media call in May). But he is a good player and has played a lot of soccer over the past three and a half years. He's still very much in the race.

Right back becomes even more interesting. Dest hasn't played with the national team since March 2024 due to his ACL surgery and recovery. Joe Scally wasn't called up and DeJuan Jones had to withdraw due to an injury when he was replaced by Nathan Harriel – who hasn't even always been the starter for the Union at right back due to the emergency of Frankie Westfield – who is with the U.S. U-20 team.

That leaves us with Alex Freeman. The Orlando City homegrown has impressed this season to the point where he's one of the top young American players in MLS at age 20. Freeman (who is the son of former NFL great Antonio Freeman) is extremely athletic and fits the profile of a modern fullback. Despite only being in his first season as an Orlando starter, he is now heading into the Gold Cup where he will play a lot of minutes and perhaps even be the team's starter. He on a very accelerated push in his development. It is reminiscent of when DeAndre Yedlin forced his way on the 2014 World Cup team. Like Yedlin, big European suitors could soon follow (but whether he wants to risk losing playing time in a World Cup year is another question).

 

 

The central midfield of this Gold Cup roster has a lot of interesting names including Sebastian Berhalter, Jack McGlynn, and Luca de la Torre. It's important to note that Weston McKennie and Yunus Musah would be here in normal circumstances, so it remains unclear how many spots are up for grabs (although it doesn't seem like Musah is a lock right now given his second half of the season). But these players are all here over players such as Tanner Tessmann, Aidan Morris, and Gianluca Busio. That means there is likely at least one opening if they play well this month.

Berhalter has taken his game to another level in 2025 and that has seen him rewarded with a call-up. Despite being suspended for the final, Berhalter was critical in helping the Caps advance to the CONCACAF Champions Cup final and he is also a big factor in their first place standing. The concern is that he has not been playing at a very high level for a long period of time. He must show that his form the past three months is not a blip.

De la Torre has been out of the team for almost a year after dealing with injuries and a lack of playing time at Celta Vigo. Now on loan with San Diego FC, he is in good form and is playing regularly again. He offers a lot to this team in that he brings experience, quality, and the benefit of not having been part of the team's recent problems.

While Pochettino made several changes to the USMNT midfield from March, McGlynn remains on the team. His January camp along with a decent shift off the bench in the loss to Panama helped his case, but by no means is he a lock. He needs to play well.

 

 

Without Tim Weah, Christian Pulisic, or even Alex Zendejas on this roster, the U.S. team is short on players who attack from wide positions. Players like Diego Luna, Malik Tillman, or either Aaronson brother can play outside as a second position, but that isn't a strength of this team. And all those players could bring a lot to the team if they could also thrive on the wings.

Haji Wright plays on the wing a lot for Coventry, but he frequently tries to cut inside. Wright is just one of the many players who has been around the team for years but who shouldn't be considered a lock anymore. There is pressure on him to produce.

Quinn Sullivan is more comfortable playing outside than most players on this roster. He arrives in camp in the middle of another strong season for Philadelphia and he has an opportunity in the month ahead that could be surprisingly significant in his hopes of being with the team moving forward.

Attacking midfield is very interesting because Gio Reyna is not on the team due to the Club World Cup (although it is not a given he would have made it anyway given his lack of minutes).

Diego Luna is in a great position now given his contributions this year which is reflected by the complements from Pochettino.

Malik Tillman is coming off a great season but is under some pressure given that he has never seen his club form translate over to the national team and that needs to happen soon.

The Aaronson brothers are also key to watch. Brenden was left off the USMNT roster in March and that might have been a blessing in disguise as he was 6000 miles removed from the disaster that unfolded. But it also showed that Pochettino is hesitant with him. He has been a regular for a long time and he had a good season where he played a lot to help Leeds earn promotion. But his grip on a roster spot is tenuous and he has a lot to lose with a bad camp.

Meanwhile Paxten has been involved with the USMNT before, but this is different. Now he is no longer seen as a future prospect, but rather he is a player who is more ready to be able to contribute now. This past season, he was on loan to FC Utrecht and emerged as one of the top young players in the Eredivisie. His parent club, Eintracht Frankfurt, is looking forward to his return as they prepare for the Champions League.

 

 

Ricardo Pepi is injured and Folarin Balogun had to withdraw from this past USMNT camp due to injury. Pepi made a great impression with the team under Pochettino in the fall and likely remains in good standing. Balogun is different because he's not in a great position with his club and might have lost his starting position heading into next year.

Josh Sargent, meanwhile, was left off this roster due to Pochettino's decision. Sargent didn't impress in two camps under Pochettino and hasn't scored for the national team since 2019. Despite being named to the Championship team of the season, he has work to do to get back in the squad. He's in the mix, but on the outside of the bubble.

That leaves us with three center forwards on this roster.

Patrick Agyemang and Brian White have been involved in both camps in 2025. Even if all options are healthy, there are likely open roster spots for Agyemang and White – who are both very different. White is a close-range finisher with impressive size while Agyemang is more mobile. A good month by either or both could make a World Cup spot theirs to lose.

Damion Downs is in a slightly different position than White or Agyemang. He's a forward but this is his first USMNT and his youth national team experience is also limited. He is behind others, but that doesn't mean he can't make up ground. He is coming off a very good season with Cologne where he scored 11 goals across all competitions and helped the team to promotion to the Bundesliga. That gives him a great stage heading into year before the World Cup. But there is also a longer-term play for him. At just 20 years old, this is important for him just to get involved in the program. He will be 24 in 2030 and 28 in 2034. Even if he doesn't make the 2026 World Cup team, he is an important prospect for the future.

 

 

Goalkeeping continues to be a big question mark for the team given that Matt Turner is still the No. 1 and has only rarely played in England over the past two seasons. He remains the USMNT starter because no one else has made a compelling case. But if he continues to be a backup at the club level, Turner is at risk every time he reports to USMNT duty. One bad camp could see him moving to a backup role there as well.

In recent camps, it appeared that Zack Steffen and Patrick Schulte were the ones pushing him. Both of those keepers had to withdraw due to injury. Will Matt Freese and Chris Brady push Turner? Perhaps. But Schulte and Steffen will continue to be in the picture over the next year.

The key takeaway is that if Turner doesn't perform for the team over the next month, the goalkeeping position will become chaotic.","{'href': 'http://www.americansoccernow.com', 'title': 'American Soccer Now'}","soccer"

Jeff Carlisle and Ryan O'Hanlon look ahead to the Gold Cup for the USMNT. (1:49)

The Gold Cup was supposed to be Mauricio Pochettino's last chance to pressure-test his A team. Could his players find a way to control games and start generating a higher quantity and quality of chances at the same time? Who are the first-choice midfielders? Is Timothy Weah really better on the left because of his dominant eye?

These were all questions that we thought might get answered this summer -- until the roster for the tournament came out.

The team's two best players, Christian Pulisic and Antonee Robinson, are taking the summer off, as is Pulisic's AC Milan teammate Yunus Musah. Weah and Juventus teammate Weston McKennie, along with Borussia Dortmund's Giovanni Reyna, are skipping the Gold Cup in favor of FIFA's new competition, the Club World Cup. AS Monaco's Folarin Balogun and PSV Eindhoven's Sergiño Dest just dropped out because of injuries. And three of the starters from the shocking 1-0 loss to Panama in the Nations League, Borussia Monchengladbach's Joe Scally, Lyon's Tanner Tessmann and Norwich City's Josh Sargent, were also left off the roster.

That's somewhere between five and nine possible starters who won't be at the Gold Cup. Any questions about this team's top gear will be left unanswered until the World Cup.

But we will learn something about the USMNT this summer in terms of the kind of depth it has.

To get a sense of where things stand, we're running back the same exercise from last summer, where I ranked the top 15 players at each position in the USMNT player pool. The rankings are a combination of form, potential and Pochettino's revealed preferences from his past couple of rosters. The purpose here isn't to determine who the 14th-best center back is; in fact, the difference between the 14th-best center back and the 30th best is probably way smaller than the gap between No. 14 and No. 1. Instead, the point is to get all of the names out there, to see where the team has stockpiles of talent and where it could really benefit from someone making a leap.

1. Matt Turner, Crystal Palace
2. Patrick Schulte, Columbus Crew
3. Zack Steffen, Colorado Rapids
4. Matthew Freese, New York City FC
5. Chris Brady, Chicago Fire FC
6. Diego Kochen, Barcelona
7. Ethan Horvath, Cardiff City
8. Roman Celentano, FC Cincinnati
9. Jonathan Klinsmann, Cesena
10. Gaga Slonina, Chelsea
11. Brad Stuver, Austin FC
12. Sean Johnson, Toronto FC
13. John Pulskamp, Sporting Kansas City
14. Joe Willis, Nashville SC

Last summer, this is what I wrote:

This used to be a position of strength for the USMNT, and now it's probably the weakest spot in the entire player pool. But I'm not sure that's as bad as it seems.

Obviously, a team at the USMNT's level -- somewhere in the 15th-30th best-in-the-world range -- specifically benefits from having a great goalkeeper. These teams are not going to dominate their way to trophies. If one of these sides is to make a deep run in a major tournament -- like Morocco at the previous World Cup -- they are going to need to win a couple matches in which the opposition creates the majority of the chances. In those matches, you need your keeper to come up big.

I stand by most of this, and maybe even the ""I'm not sure that's as bad as it seems"" part.

Turner played zero Premier League minutes this season for Crystal Palace. He made three FA Cup starts and one Carabao Cup start. And then he played four matches for the USMNT in the Nations League. In other words, he has played 360 minutes for Palace and 360 minutes for the USMNT since August.

That's not a lot, but over that limited stretch of time, Turner was ... actually pretty good? In those eight games, he faced 32 shots on goal. And per Stats Perform's post-shot expected goals model, the average keeper would be expected to concede 10.46. Turner gave up only seven goals.

Listen, would you rather that your starting keeper played more Premier League minutes than the guy writing this article, your mailman, or the person who styles Timothée Chalamet's mustache? Yes, you would. But if your starting keeper is going to play only 800 minutes across an entire season, you'd want those minutes to look like the ones Turner put up.

And none of the MLS options are banging down the door. Schulte continues to be solid, but there's no one putting up the kinds of performances that Turner did when he was in the league. With Barcelona's rumored move for Joan García, Kochen isn't going to be getting any playing time there in the near future. Slonina also has stalled out at Chelsea.

Until he's clearly and actively making the team worse, Turner is going to start.

1. Sergiño Dest, PSV Eindhoven
2. Joe Scally, Borussia Monchengladbach
3. Alex Freeman, Orlando City SC
4. Nathan Harriel, Philadelphia Union
5. Marlon Fossey, Standard Liege
6. Shaq Moore, FC Dallas
7. Bryan Reynolds, Westerlo
8. DeAndre Yedlin, FC Cincinnati
9. Reggie Cannon, Colorado Rapids
10. Griffin Dorsey, Houston Dynamo FC
11. Brooks Lennon, Atlanta United FC
12. Jake Davis, Sporting Kansas City
13. Bode Hidalgo, Real Salt Lake
14. Kyle Duncan, New York Red Bulls
15. Keegan Rosenberry, Colorado Rapids

The depth here is a little better than it looks -- both Musah and Weah can also play the position. But it still feels like ""Dest or Bust.""

Musah got on the ball a ton against Panama, but he looked like a midfielder playing fullback: cutting inside and keeping possession. Scally, too, never adds much to the attack when he's out there.

Dest, though, is a genuine game-breaker at the international level for his position. Almost everyone in the United States' starting lineup plays much better when the team has less of the ball and can create fast transitions. If we remove Gio Reyna from the equation, Dest is really the only player who can consistently create dangerous moments against more conservative defensive structures.

It would be great if someone else emerged in this position who could also be a plus with the ball -- maybe Freeman shows that at the Gold Cup. But Dest is a Champions League-level attacking fullback, and most countries don't have two of those. It's nice that he's back on the roster, but his performance this summer wouldn't have really mattered. Pochettino just needs him to be healthy next year.

Herculez Gomez and Ryan O'Hanlon question whether Tim Ream will play alongside Chris Richards for the USMNT at the World Cup.

1. Chris Richards, Crystal Palace
2. Tim Ream, Charlotte FC
3. Mark McKenzie, Toulouse
4. Miles Robinson, FC Cincinnati
5. Cameron Carter-Vickers, Celtic
6. Auston Trusty, Celtic
7. Walker Zimmerman, Nashville SC
8. George Campbell, CF Montréal
9. Tristan Blackmon, Vancouver Whitecaps
10. Jalen Neal, CF Montréal
11. Noahkai Banks, FC Augsburg
12. Jackson Ragen, Seattle Sounders FC
13. Justen Glad, Real Salt Lake
14. Aaron Long, LAFC
15. Matt Miazga, FC Cincinnati

Who should partner with Richards? And will Richards ever play at a high level for the USMNT? These seem to be the two defining questions at center back.

Ream will be 38 at the next World Cup, and I'm incredibly skeptical that he'll be good enough to be starting for a team that wants to reach the quarterfinals, if not deeper. Ream is one of the best American center backs ever, but nearly every soccer player to ever play the sport at a high level has not been capable of competing at a World Cup at that age.

I sometimes wonder whether national team managers make center-back selections incorrectly. This is the position where two players are most reliant on each other. A manager should want to try to give multiple pairings multiple games of reps with each other. But it's also a position with the highest punishment-to-mistake ratio, so most fledgling partnerships don't get a chance to grow after a player makes an error that immediately leads to a goal.

Ream-Richards is the only CB pairing to log any consistent minutes thus far, but I really think Pochettino would do well to give McKenzie and Robinson multiple looks with Richards. Robinson probably has the higher ceiling, but McKenzie has played much more consistently at a much higher level.

1. Antonee Robinson, Fulham
2. Max Arfsten, Columbus Crew
3. DeJuan Jones, San Jose Earthquakes
4. John Tolkin, Holstein Kiel
5. Kristoffer Lund, Palermo
6. Caleb Wiley, Chelsea
7. George Bello, LASK Linz
8. Ryan Hollingshead, LAFC
9. Kevin O'Toole, New York City FC
10. John Nelson, LA Galaxy
11. Andrew Gutman, Chicago Fire
12. Sam Junqua, Real Salt Lake
13. Marco Farfan, FC Dallas
14. Anthony Markanich, Minnesota United FC
15. Jonathan Gomez, PAOK Salonika

It's the Summer of Arfsten, baby!

At least, he was the only left back on the initial Gold Cup roster -- Tolkin was since added, so presumably he'll be getting a ton of minutes over the next month. We'll see if either of them can prove a reliable backup to Robinson and potentially slide ahead of Joe Scally on the true left-back depth chart.

But ultimately, it's the same story as on the right side. It's Robinson, and no one else is close. Yes, it's a bummer he won't play this summer, but he's arguably the best player in the entire pool, so if his taking off this summer increases the chances that he's fresh come the World Cup, then it's absolutely worth it.

Robinson is one of the four or five most athletic left backs in the world. Per PFF FC data, only two players in the Premier League registered a higher maximum speed than he did this past season: Nottingham Forest's Anthony Elanga and Manchester City's Erling Haaland. And he's one of only two players in the league, along with Crystal Palace's Daniel Muñoz, who covered more than 16 kilometers while sprinting (moving at a speed of 25 kph or more).

Oh, and he also created 10 assists; only three players in the league had more.

Robinson genuinely might have been the best left back in the Premier League last season. Were he, say three years younger, there's a good chance he'd be playing for Liverpool or Manchester City next season.

1. Tyler Adams, AFC Bournemouth
2. Johnny Cardoso, Real Betis
3. Tanner Tessmann, Lyon
4. Sean Zawadzki, Columbus Crew
5. Aidan Morris, Middlesbrough
6. Maxi Dietz, SpVgg Greuther Furth
7. Emeka Eneli, Real Salt Lake
8. Lennard Maloney, Heidenheim
9. James Sands, St. Pauli
10. Santiago Castaneda, Paderborn
11. Keaton Parks, New York City FC
12. Kellyn Acosta, Chicago Fire FC
13. Edwin Cerrillo, LA Galaxy
14. Wil Trapp, Minnesota United FC
15. Daniel Edelman, New York Red Bulls

There's some really nice depth here, at one of the premium positions in world soccer.

Adams was ever-present in a Bournemouth team that really should have finished higher in the Premier League table than it did (ninth). Now, Bournemouth's approach in possession kind of discarded the idea of a midfield altogether; they played long balls from the backline up to the forwards and then asked their midfielders to clean up everything. There was no measured buildup play through the center. But we know who Adams is at this point, and the important thing is that he played -- nearly 2,000 league minutes after making only one start the season before.

Cardoso consolidated himself after a successful half-season with Real Betis the season before. He's a reliable passer who won't take too many risks, can dribble out of pressure, and will win the ball a ton. That sounds like the ideal Diego Simeone midfielder, right? Well, guess who is reportedly Atletico Madrid's top target this summer?

The interesting thing here is that these two don't really make much sense as a pairing -- not against any team the USMNT plays at the Gold Cup. But I do think they'd make a lot of sense as a defensive double pivot against any of the teams the USMNT will be underdogs against at the World Cup. Do you let them play together in games in which that might hurt your chances of winning so that they get some time together before next summer?

Elsewhere, Tessman became a starter at Lyon, Zawadzki was on the initial Gold Cup roster and Morris had a really nice first season with Middlesbrough. In Qatar, the U.S. couldn't play anyone other than Musah, McKennie and Adams, but midfield has since become the team's main position of strength.

1. Weston McKennie, Juventus
2. Yunus Musah, AC Milan
3. Malik Tillman, PSV Eindhoven
4. Jack McGlynn, Houston Dynamo
5. Diego Luna, Real Salt Lake
6. Gio Reyna, Borussia Dortmund
7. Brenden Aaronson, Leeds United
8. Quinn Sullivan, Philadelphia Union
9. Luca de la Torre, San Diego FC
10. Sebastian Berhalter, Vancouver Whitecaps
11. Paxten Aaronson, Eintracht Frankfurt
12. Gianluca Busio, Venezia
13. Brian Gutierrez, Chicago Fire FC
14. Richard Ledezma, PSV Eindhoven
15. Benjamin Cremaschi, Inter Miami CF

Some of these players will be used more often in wing roles, but if U.S. Soccer listed a player as a midfielder on the initial roster, I slotted him into this section. Pulisic, too, could play as a midfielder, behind the striker, at the World Cup. In other words: a lot of options here.

McKennie is one the team's reliable stalwarts. Musah's career feels as if it has stalled at AC Milan, but he's also 22 years old and still starting half of the Serie A matches. He could easily have a bounce-back season before the World Cup. I keep waiting for Tillman to have a breakout performance for the USMNT, and with the B team-ish roster around him, maybe this summer is when he gets his chance.

In MLS, McGlynn, Luna and Sullivan are all both (A) really exciting prospects, and (B) legitimately good players already. I'd expect the former two to play a lot this summer, and it wouldn't surprise me if Sullivan also gets on the field a bunch, thanks to the limited wing options on the roster.

Beyond those guys, it's Reyna and a bunch of players who play a ton in MLS or are starters for European clubs just outside of the top tier. Like I said in the last section, midfield depth is not going to be a problem next summer.

1. Christian Pulisic, AC Milan
2. Timothy Weah, Juventus
3. Alejandro Zendejas, Club America
4. Griffin Yow, Westerlo
5. Matko Miljevic, Huracán
6. Kevin Paredes, VfL Wolfsburg
7. Cade Cowell, Guadalajara
8. Indiana Vassilev, Philadelphia Union
9. Paul Arriola, Seattle Sounders FC
10. Cole Campbell, Borussia Dortmund
11. Alex Muyl, Nashville SC
12. Emmanuel Sabbi, Vancouver Whitecaps
13. Taylor Booth, FC Utrecht
14. Konrad De La Fuente, Lausanne Sports
15. Jared Stroud, D.C. United

The load-bearing, ball-carrying, chance-creating, goal-scoring winger is the most important player in soccer's current era. Think about the four leading Ballon d'Or candidates for this season: Paris Saint-Germain's Ousmane Dembélé -- winger. Barcelona's Raphinha and Lamine Yamal -- wingers. Liverpool's Mohamed Salah -- winger.

PSG won the Champions League in utterly dominant fashion largely because they have four of these players: Dembele, Désiré Doué, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Bradley Barcola. Real Madrid has Vinícius Júnior. Arsenal has Bukayo Saka. Bayern Munich has Michael Olise and Jamal Musiala. Having at least one of these players is table stakes at the highest level of the sport.

(Side note: Four of these players are French. Kylian Mbappé is also French. Good luck next summer, everyone else!)

The good news for the USMNT: The best American player ever plays this position. He's not on the same level as any of the wingers I've named, but Pulisic is good enough to play the role for a team that qualifies for the Champions League more often than not.

Weah isn't this kind of player, but he's a perfectly capable secondary option opposite Pulisic. After that, though? It's not great.

Zendejas and Yow aren't really the third and fourth options. Neither one is on the Gold Cup roster, so I'd expect some of the more attacking-midfielder types listed in the previous section (Tillman, Sullivan, Luna and Brenden Aaronson) to take up most of the wing minutes this summer.

Apart from Sullivan, who has zero USMNT caps, none of the other options comes close to providing the same speedy, physical threat that Pulisic and Weah do. Brenden Aaronson has all the physical tools, too, but almost all his value comes when the team is out of possession.

Though I do think Pulisic sometimes devolves into playing hero-ball with the U.S. -- dropping deep and trying to do everything, rather than staying high and trusting his teammates to get him the ball in more dangerous positions -- he's by far the best attacker on the team. It's probably a good thing that the team will get some competitive reps without him on the field this summer, but if he's not around next summer? There's no way to solve that problem.

Herculez Gomez and Ryan O'Hanlon compare the USMNT's striker options ahead of the World Cup.

1. Folarin Balogun, AS Monaco
2. Ricardo Pepi, PSV Eindhoven
3. Patrick Agyemang, Charlotte FC
4. Haji Wright, Coventry City
5. Brian White, Vancouver Whitecaps
6. Damion Downs, FC Cologne
7. Josh Sargent, Norwich City
8. Brandon Vázquez, Austin FC
9. Jesús Ferreira, Seattle Sounders FC
10. Jordan Morris, Seattle Sounders FC
11. Jordan Pefok, Stade de Reims
12. Daryl Dike, West Bromwich Albion
13. Jeremy Ebobisse, LAFC
14. Samuel Adeniran, LASK Linz
15. Nicholas Gioacchini, Asteras Tripolis

If we look at all the players in Europe's Big Five leagues who have played 90-minute chunks of matches at least 25 times over the past two seasons, Balogun ranks 21st in non-penalty expected goals per 90 minutes.

He's averaging about 0.5 expected goals (xG) per game, and his shot map is close to perfect: almost nothing from outside the box, and so much from inside the goal posts. There are no wasted possessions:

Some players he ranks ahead of in per-90 xG over the past two seasons: Raphinha, Salah, Diogo Jota, Lautaro Martínez, Ollie Watkins and Vinicius Junior.

But what if we expand our search beyond the Big Five leagues -- to all of the leagues for which the website FBref has advanced data? And then what if we drop the minutes threshold down to only 10 90s?

If we do all of that, there's one player at the top to average 0.9 non-penalty expected goals per 90 minutes over the past two seasons. That player is Pepi.

Now, there are all kinds of issues with these numbers. Balogun hasn't been a consistent starter over the past two seasons, and he has been stuck in a finishing slump. Pepi, meanwhile, almost never starts while playing for a team that's significantly deeper than almost all of its opponents and plays in a defensively weak league.

But do you remember the 2022 World Cup? When Gregg Berhalter had to cycle through different center-forward options every game -- and for the only goal scored by a striker to be an accidental deflection off of Wright's heel?

Even if Balogun and Pepi are both imperfect, they're both so much more promising than any of the options the USMNT has had in a long time. Provided they're both healthy next summer -- not a given since both are currently injured -- divvying the center-forward minutes between the two of them should give the team enough firepower in that position.

And beyond those two, the options really aren't all that bad. Agyemang and White have shown some flashes to suggest they can contribute at this level. Wright is a good player in the Championship and totally serviceable as depth. Sargent continues to be the most strangely polarizing USMNT player I can remember for the gap between his exploits in England's second-tier and what he does for the national team. And Downs just had a really nice year for the best team in Germany's second division.

Strangely, I think the team's attacking depth has shifted in an inopportune way. There are now a bunch of decent striker options, while the wing depth has thinned. The problem with that: only one center forward can play at a time.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Liam Delap signed a six-year contract with Chelsea on Wednesday through 2031 as their marquee striker signing of the summer, but fans won't have to wait until next season to see him don a blue shirt.

Delap was left off Lee Carsley's England squad for the upcoming UEFA European U21 Championship since he'll be competing with his new club in the United States for the FIFA Club World Cup. 

22-year-old Delap follows in the footsteps of Romelu Lukaku, Tammy Abraham and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to name a few to wear the number nine shirt. He'll compete with Nicolas Jackson for the starting role as Enzo Maresca looks to solve his striker dilemma. Neither Jackson nor Christopher Nkunku have managed to make the position their own and Marc Guiu is still young. Chelsea haven't had a long term answer at striker since Diego Costa left in 2017. 

Delap scored 12 Premier League goals this season across 37 appearances. Alongside Cole Palmer, Delap has the potential to up his tally and get valuable Champions League experience this season.

The former Manchester City academy product was coached by Maresca in the club's Elite Development Squad. Chelsea activated Delap's £30 million ($40.6 million) release clause with Ipswich Town after the Tractor Boys were relegated to the EFL Championship at the end of the 2024–25 season.

Chelsea are favoured to advance from Group D in the Club World Cup where they'll face ES Tunis, Flamengo and LAFC. Depending on their group finish, they could face either Bayern Munich, Benfica or Boca Juniors in the round of 16.

Real Madrid are reportedly in the final stages of negations with Benfica to bring Álvaro Carreras to the Spanish capital. 

After signing zero players in the winter transfer window, Real Madrid are focused on building their defense this summer. The club already signed Dean Huijsen and Trent Alexander-Arnold, and now are closing in on a major left back reinforcement. 

MARCA report the Spanish giants are “finalizing the details” of Carreras's transfer from Benfica. Despite “arduous” negotiations, Real Madrid are reportedly confident they will have the fullback in a white shirt in time for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

The Spanish outlet revealed Real Madrid agreed to pay Carreras's €50 million ($57 million) release clause in full just to get the deal over the line. The 22-year-old, meanwhile, has “expressed his desire” to join Xabi Alonso's team and is “awaiting the transfer agreement” in Lisbon.

Carreras is coming off an impressive 2024–25 season for Benfica. The Spaniard made 50 appearances across all competitions for the Portuguese side and played a pivotal role in Benfica's second-place league finish, as well as their deep run in the Taça de Portugal.

Real Madrid are in desperate need of a young, talented defender like Carreras with this summer's FIFA Club World Cup just one week away. Ferland Mendy is expected to miss the entire tournament due to injury, leaving Fran García as the only natural left back in Alonso's squad.

Should Carreras indeed complete his move to Real Madrid, he will have almost an immediate opportunity to prove himself to the club's new manager against some of the best competition in world. He, along with Huijsen and Alexander-Arnold, would form an almost completely-revamped backline for Los Blancos after a season marred by defense struggles and injuries.

Manuel Akanji has broken ranks by openly criticising Manchester City's upcoming Club World Cup schedule.

Pep Guardiola's side have been drawn into Group G of the competition - alongside Juventus, Al-Ain and Wydad FC - which is set to kick-off next weekend, just three weeks after the Premier League season concluded.

If City go all the way in the tournament, they could find themselves playing until mid-July, giving players just a month off before the 2025-26 season starts.

For many players, these past couple of weeks have not provided them the opportunity to kick back and relax for the summer, as they have international football duties to attend to.

And Akanji, who is currently in the US on Switzerland duty for their upcoming pair of friendlies, has candidly spoken out against the fixture congestion.

The centre back said: 'I have been a strong critic of this competition for some time now. We players would love to have some holidays, and some time for our bodies to rest.'

Coming off their first trophy-less season under Guardiola since 2017, it is unsurprising that City's players are not keen to get right back onto the field after just a few weeks.

Akanji went on to explain that the rest of the squad are 'not exactly overjoyed' about the upcoming games, which come off the back of a 57-game campaign. 

The 29-year-old added: 'My City teammates are not exactly overjoyed about the tournament either. But it's now right in our faces, and there is nothing we can do about it.

'If we take part, then of course we want to win it. But if we reach the final, then the time period for us to recover ahead of the new season will become even shorter.'

When asked about City's underwhelming 2024-25 campaign, Akanji offered an optimistic verdict and argued it could have been 'far worse' than it turned out to be.

City finished third, earning them a spot in next season's Champions League competition, while they were dispatched in the FA Cup final by Crystal Palace, and knocked out of the EFL Cup and Champions League in the earlier rounds. 

'Set against the expectations we have, this hasn't been a good season,' Akanji continued. 'We finished third in the Premier League, three points behind Arsenal, and qualified for the Champions League.

'But it is still our worst campaign for some time. However, Pep Guardiola still said he was proud of us for never giving up. The season could have finished far worse than it did.'

Teams are expected to take this year's Club World Cup more serious than ever before, considering the mammoth prize pool at stake.

The side that takes the trophy home will receive a windfall of $40m (£30m), while a team winning of their games could see them land up to $125m (£92m).

For reference, the winner of the Champions League earns around £120m, while the Premier League champions typically earn between £38m and £40m for finishing first.

From this year onwards, the Club World Cup will take place once every four years, the next rendition coming in 2029.

City have won the trophy once - back in 2023 - when it was an annual competition.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"

Inter Miami CF get the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup underway when meeting Egyptian powerhouse Al Ahly on Saturday, June 14 at Hard Rock Stadium.

In Group A action, the Herons will also face FC Porto (Portugal) on June 19 at Atlanta United's Mercedes-Benz Stadium before returning to Hard Rock Stadium and encountering Palmeiras (Brazil) on June 23. The top two teams per group reach the knockout phase.

This summer's expanded Club World Cup features 32 teams from six confederations vying for silverware and portions of the unprecedented $1 billion prize pool. The final is set for July 13 at MetLife Stadium.

How they qualified: 2020-21 CAF Champions League winners

Al Ahly are the most successful club team in African history, winning the CAF Champions League 12 times. That includes four titles from 2020-24, as well as a run to the 2025 semifinals.

Naturally, the Cairo-based outfit have dominated their domestic league as well. They're fresh off a third straight Egyptian Premier League title, giving them a record 45 overall.

Spanish manager José Riveiro oversees Al Ahly, who recently signed Egyptian international forward Trézéguet. He'll look to link up with compatriot Emam Ashour in the final third.

While Al Ahly don't have a global star, they're certainly capable of beating Miami and shouldn't be trifled with.

How they qualified: Host country spot

Inter Miami's Club World Cup debut arrives after winning the 2024 Supporters' Shield with a league-record 74 points (2.18 ppg).

This offers a fitting stage for their global-minded, ambitious project that sprinted into action in July 2023 when Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba joined the club. Then last year, Luis Suárez arrived to make it a ""Core Four"" of FC Barcelona legends in South Florida.

The Herons now hope to go on a deep Club World Cup run, boosted by a 2W-0L-1D uptick in their last three league games and Messi producing 7g/4a in seven games across May to be named the MLS Player of the Month.

Can head coach Javier Mascherano's side start strong in Group A? It likely hinges on their balance between defense and Messi's brilliance.","{'href': 'https://www.mlssoccer.com', 'title': 'MLSsoccer.com'}","soccer"

The 2026 World Cup may be a year away, but Panini and FIFA have teamed up this spring for a new, first-of-its-kind sticker album. 

The album marks a significant milestone in soccer collectibles in that it is the first official Club World Cup album produced by Panini. 

Out now, the album features 548 stickers across 72 pages, offering fans a comprehensive collection of the tournament's teams and players. 

This newest Panini album and stickers coincides with the inaugural 32-team format of the FIFA Club World Cup, which kicks off June 13. The tournament will be played in 11 cities in 12 stadiums across the United States.

The Club World Cup is an international men's soccer tournament where the champion clubs from each of the six FIFA confederations (AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, OFC and UEFA) compete to determine the world's best club team. 

Teams featured in the album include Real Madrid, Boca Juniors, Chelsea, PSG, Inter Milan and Manchester City. Some of the best players in the world are also featured, such as Lionel Messi, Harry Kane, Lautaro Martinez, Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe. 

While Panini has also issued a Prizm set (featuring 200 base cards) of the tournament's top players, stickers continue to maintain their allure among collectors. There are many online groups where collectors from around the world can trade. 

Panini sticker albums, especially World Cup ones, have been a stable among soccer collectors since 1970. While cards have become very popular with soccer collectors in the U.S. and abroad, stickers continue to be hot sellers.   

Each pack contains five stickers. The album and packs are available now on Panini America's website.

FIFA's newly expanded Club World Cup kicks off in Miami on June 14, featuring some of soccer's biggest stars like Lionel Messi and greatest teams like Real Madrid. But the launch of the new-look tournament, staged in the United States, also comes with uncertainty over how it will be embraced in an already bloated calendar where soccer is played virtually year-round.

This is world governing body FIFA's big play to get a stronghold in the club game. Until now, club soccer's marquee events have been regional competitions such as the prestigious Champions League, which is organized by European soccer body UEFA.

FIFA hopes the four-yearly event will be to club soccer what the World Cup is to international soccer and establish itself as one of the biggest and wealthiest tournaments in sport.

But that is far from assured amid a backlash from players over fear of burnout and it is still unknown how much appetite there is among fans for another competition. 

Here is what to know about the Club World Cup.

Inter Miami plays Al Ahly at the Hard Rock Stadium in the opening game on June 14. The final is July 13 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

The Club World Cup has been expanded from seven teams to 32 and will emulate the men's and women's World Cups. Eight groups of four teams will play in a round robin mini league, with the top two advancing to a knockout stage, which runs from the round of 16 through to the final.




Staged in the United States, host cities include Atlanta, Cincinnati, Charlotte, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York/New Jersey, Orlando, Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington, D.C.




Some of Europe's biggest teams will take part, including Real Madrid, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Juventus, this year's Champions League winner Paris Saint-Germain and runner-up Inter Milan.

From South America, top Brazilian clubs Fluminense, Flamengo, Palmeiras and Botafogo — all recent winners of Copa Libertadores, South America's top clup competition — will participate, while River Plate and Boca Juniors will represent Argentina.

Inter Miami, Seattle Sounders and LAFC lead the U.S. charge. Mexico is represented by Monterrey and Pachuca, while top teams from Asia, Africa and the Oceana are also taking part.

Notable absentees include European giants Barcelona, Liverpool and Manchester United, who failed to meet FIFA's convoluted qualifying criteria based on winning continental titles like the Champions League over the previous four years and ranking points. Countries are also limited to two entrants unless they have more than two winners of continental titles.

Messi anyone? Arguably the greatest player of all time will get the chance to add to his trophy collection, though Inter Miami is considered a rank outsider to be crowned world champion.

Kylian Mbappé, Vinícius Júnior and Jude Bellingham are in Madrid's star-studded squad, while Manchester City has Erling Haaland and Ballon d'Or winner Rodri. Harry Kane, Lautaro Martínez, Ousmane Dembele and Champions League final player of the match Désiré Doué will also be there.

Cristiano Ronaldo is a question mark. His Saudi team Al Nassr failed to qualify, but he fueled speculation about a possible move to another club in a recent social media post, while FIFA President Gianni Infantino said the Portuguese star could end up playing in the Club World Cup because of a unique transfer window.

There will be Saudi involvement though in the form of Al-Hilal.

With a total prize fund of $1 billion, the winner of the Club World Cup could earn $125 million.

FIFA said in March that it had allocated $525 million in guaranteed fees for teams taking part. That ranges from $38.19 million to the top-ranked European team to $3.58 million for the representative from Oceania, Auckland City.

A further $475 million is earned by results in the 63 games, with $2 million paid for winning group stage games, $7.5 million for playing in the round of 16 and $40 million to the team that wins the final.

The old version of the Club World Cup, which was played yearly, was dominated by European teams in recent times. Only Brazilian team Corinthians broke Europe's winning run in 17 years. 

An expanded tournament will give more South American teams the chance to test themselves against their European counterparts.

Saudi Arabia has made a big push in recent years to become a player in global soccer and has attracted superstars like Ronaldo, Neymar and Karim Benzema to the oil-rich kingdom, as well as winning the right to stage the World Cup in 2034. This will be its first opportunity for it to make a statement in a major global tournament since that drive. 

Inter Miami has already announced itself to the world after luring Messi and Luis Suarez to MLS and can further enhance its reputation. 

For European giants Madrid and Manchester City, the Club World Cup could see them add some shine to what has been a disappointing season for both after relinquishing their titles.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Bayern Munich considering using Leon Goretzka at center-back for Club World Cup","https://www.bavarianfootballworks.com/2025/6/6/24444033/bayern-munich-fifa-club-world-cup-leon-goretzka-josip-stanisic-center-back-vincent-kompany-injuries","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 01:00:00 GMT","

Filed under:

Vincen Kompany is running thin on options in defense, so he's going to have to improvise this summer. 

Right after the international break, Bayern Munich gets set to embark upon their FIFA Club World Cup journey in the United States, with their first match set to take place on June 15th vs. Auckland City in Cincinatti, Ohio at the TQL Stadium. The group stage for the German Rekordmeister ends on the 24th in Charlotte, North Carolina against Benfica and it is expected that the reigning Bundesliga champions will progress to the knockout stages.

But nothing is a given, especially with the amount of injuries Bayern has to the squad.

Bayern head coach Vincent Kompany is really going to be short on central defenders for the tournament. Dayot Upamecano, Kim Min-jae, and Hiroki Ito are all still out injured, and Bayer Leverkusen are still demanding a high fee for Bayern to pay to have Jonathan Tah officially available from the start of the tournament as opposed to from July 1st onward. As things stand, Josip Stanišić is the only fit senior center-back available for Kompany.

Nonetheless, per information from tz's Philipp Kessler and Manuel Bonke (as per @iMiaSanMia), Kompany and his coaching staff is seriously considering the idea of having Leon Goretzka partner Stanišić in the center of defense from the start of the tournament. The Belgian manager really does not have many other options available, and while Goretzka might not be the most popular candidate to line up at the heart of the back line, he has played there before.

While Kompany has not used Goretzka at center back before, Thomas Tuchel did in the first round DFB-Pokal clash last season against SC Preußen Münster — a match where Bayern won 4-0, keeping a clean sheet. Goretzka also featured in the center of defense in the 0-0 draw vs. FC Copenhagen in the Champions League last season when Bayern had already clinched advancement to the knockout stages.

Academy player Tarek Buchmann would not be an option with how little football he has played over the past twelve months due to injury problems and one of the only other options would be trying Adam Aznou, a left-back by trade, at center-back, which is far more of a risk despite the youngster doing well for himself on loan at Real Valladolid.

PORTLAND Ore. (KPTV) - The FIFA World Cup takes place in the U.S. next year, but Portland is helping play a part in the FIFA Club World Cup this summer.

While the closest matches will be played in Seattle, one of the teams will use Portland as a base camp.

Japan's Premiere Team, Urawa Red Diamonds, arrived at PDX on Thursday.

They will use the University of Portland as a base camp for practice and training as they prepare for group stage matches ahead of the international tournament.

“We like to show the Japanese style to the whole world. We also like to show our strong strengths points the performance, the good points of us,” said the team's captain.

Oregon is one of 14 states across the U.S. to serve as a base camp site for the 32 best soccer teams in the world.

The first kick-off is June 14 in Miami.

The first match in Seattle is June 15.

Qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup continues this weekend with a number of UEFA games, including this one on Friday between Norway and Italy.

Norway currently leads Group I, putting it in position to qualify directly to the World Cup, though there's a lot of time still left to go. Italy has yet to play a Group I match.

Norway opened Group I play with a 5-0 win over Moldova, with Julian Ryerson scoring just five minutes into the match. The team never looked back. In its second game, things were closer, but the team still came away with a 4-2 win over Israel.

The Norwegian team has won four matches in a row overall, last losing to Austria in October in Nations League play.

The last time Norway qualified for the World Cup was back in 1998, but the team also has rarely had a player like Erling Haaland, who is the all-time leading goal scorer for the team despite only beginning his national team career in 2019.

Italy didn't begin its campaign until now, as it was in the UEFA Nations League quarterfinals. It lost on penalty kicks to Germany in that round.

The once-great Italian national team has failed to qualify for the past two World Cups. Can the Italians get a big win on Friday to jump-start their journey to the biggest stage in the world?

Follow:


            Uzbekistan qualified for its debut soccer World Cup on Thursday night, becoming the first ever Central Asian country to make it to the sport's global showpiece.
    


            A 0-0 draw against the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi secured the White Wolves a top-two finish in Group A of Asian Qualifiers, and a ticket to the tournament next summer in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
    


            Uzbekistan goalkeeper Utkir Yusupov's six saves, including a last-second stop, guaranteed his team a priceless point, to proceed with one game of qualifying remaining.
    


            Fans celebrated the news across the soccer-obsessed nation, with people taking to the streets to cheer and march, with traditional music and songs.
    


            President Shavkat Mirziyoyev called qualification “a brilliant result, which will be written in golden letters in the annals of our national sport,” in a statement posted online. He added that the players had brought “a holiday gift” on the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha, widely observed in the majority-Muslim nation.
    


            The team's historic achievement is no major surprise to followers of Asian soccer, given the burgeoning talent among its squad. The side's talented 21-year-old center back Abdukodir Khusanov now plays for Manchester City, having signed for the English giants in January for a reported £33.6 million (about $45 million).
    


            Striker Eldor Shomurodov has played in Italy's top league since 2020, while promising forward Abbosbek Fayzullaev, currently at CSKA Moscow, was named Asia's Youth Player of the Year two years ago.
    


            The breakthrough is the fruit of incredible recent performance in all age groups for the nation of 36 million people, which became independent in 1991 after the dissolution of the USSR.
    


            Its trophy cabinet includes the Under-23 Asian Cup in 2018 and the Under-20 Asian Cup in 2023, as well as this year's Under-17 Asian Cup. The team – currently ranked 57th in the world – also qualified for the Olympic Games for the first time in 2024, claiming one of Asia's three berths.
    


            The 2026 World Cup will for the first time expand from 32 teams to 48 teams, giving each continent, including Asia, additional spots, though qualifying automatically – with a game to spare – suggests Uzbekistan would have made it even under the previous format.
    


            While soccer has long been beloved across the Central Asian region, that popularity has never been matched by international success at senior level. With qualification secured, Uzbekistan's fans can celebrate on home turf when they face Qatar in the final match of the round, in the capital Tashkent on Wednesday.
    


            Just hours after Uzbekistan's triumph, Jordan become the next Asian country to make history, securing its first ever trip to the World Cup, defeating Oman 3-0.
    


            Elsewhere in the region, Japan, Australia, Iran, and South Korea – all World Cup regulars – have also booked their places at next year's finals.

Jordanians are celebrating their football team's first qualification for a FIFA World Cup following win in Oman.

Jordan is celebrating the qualification of its football team for a FIFA World Cup for the first time following a decisive 3-0 victory against Oman.

Huge celebrations erupted as fans drove their cars through Jordan's capital Amman late on Thursday and into Friday, honking their horns and chanting victory while others waved the national flag in triumph.

“We are all with you!” and “It's getting closer, heroes” read messages written into the night sky in a spectacular drone light show.

Jordan sealed their place on the penultimate day of Asian qualifying for the 2026 tournament, which will be played in the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Ali Olwin netted a hat-trick as the 2023 Asian Cup runners-up to Qatar etched their name in the history books.

They secured their spot in the World Cup when South Korea defeated Iraq, also on Thursday, 2-0.

The royal court published pictures of King Abdullah II wearing a national team jersey as he watched the game from the embassy in London, where he was on a visit.

I wholeheartedly congratulate the sons and daughters of our dear people on our national football team's qualification for the World Cup finals,” he wrote on social media platform X.

“This historic qualification is well-deserved by our team, which includes stars and cadres of whom we are proud.

“Special thanks go to our loyal fans who have been our support and encouragement.”

Sohad Idrissi, a 48-year-old housewife who watched the game with her siblings, beamed with pride as she told AFP that her side had played “a beautiful game and deserved to qualify for the World Cup”.

“Today the joy is two-fold: there is the joy of Eid al-Adha, and the joy of Nashama qualifying,” she said, using a nickname for the Jordanian team.

Fadi Qalanzi, a 21-year-old university student, called the win “a dream that is finally coming true”.

“Our team put on a beautiful performance, and they truly deserved to qualify,” he added.

Osama al-Shreeda, a 60-year-old retired civil servant, also called it a dream come true.

“I've been following Jordanian football since 1978, and a relative of mine used to play with the national team,” he said.

“It's a great opportunity for our team and its players to be recognised globally,” he added, calling it an achievement not just for Jordan but for the wider Arab region.

“It was about time, this is a joy we'd been waiting for, for a long time,” said 55-year-old teacher Nashat Badr.

For Uzbekistan, a 0-0 draw against the United Arab Emirates was enough to take the second automatic qualification spot in Group A behind Iran.

With Asia now having eight guaranteed qualifiers – after just four for the 2022 edition in Qatar – Uzbekistan was a likely contender to step up.

While most of its team plays in the domestic league, it includes a few Europe-based stars like Roma forward Eldor Shomurodov and Manchester City defender Abdukodir Khusanov.

Jordan's highest-profile player is winger Mousa Tamari at French club Rennes.

Palestine's 2-0 win in Kuwait kept alive their hopes of reaching their first World Cup finals.

The victory, thanks to goals from Tamer Seyam and Wessam Abou Ali, means Palestine in fifth spot in Group B are one point outside the playoff qualification positions with one game to play.

A win in their final match in Amman, Jordan, against Oman, who hold fourth spot and are one point ahead of Palestine, on Tuesday will see them finish above their opponents.

Third and fourth positions in the three groups, in the third round of AFC qualifiers for the World Cup, progress to a fourth qualifying stage of playoffs.

The top two teams from each of the three six-team groups qualify automatically for next summer's tournament, while the teams in fifth and sixth position are eliminated.

Indonesia, meantime, remain on course for a playoff finish, and only a second appearance at a World Cup finals, following their 1-0 win against China to hold fourth spot in Group C.

Travel Ban

The U.S. State Department has sought to justify a travel ban that leaves nationals from over a dozen countries at risk of being blocked from entering the United States for the FIFA World Cup or the Olympic Games, saying that addressing security concerns is “part of what it means to host an event.”

In a press briefing on Thursday afternoon, the State Department principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott was quizzed by journalists following the announcement of full bans for citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Partial restrictions have also been imposed on the entry of nationals from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.

While President Trump's executive order, signed on Wednesday, contains exemptions for nationals who would be entering the country as athletes for major sporting events, as well as support staff and immediate relatives of athletes or teams, there are no such assurances for fans.

Iran has already qualified for the men's World Cup in 2026, which will be co-hosted in the United States, Canada and Mexico, while Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba and Libya are among the teams with varying degrees of probability of qualifying for the tournament.

Haiti's ability to play in this summer's Concacaf Gold Cup appeared to be confirmed on Thursday, having initially been placed into doubt by the executive order. This is because the order made a specified exemption for the World Cup and Olympics, but added other events would be assessed as whether they are deemed sufficiently “major” by the Secretary of State Marco Rubio. On Thursday morning, the State Department did not answer directly when asked whether either the FIFA Club World Cup or the Gold Cup, both of which will be played in the U.S. this summer, are “major sporting events.”

A State Department spokesperson simply told The Athletic: “We are implementing the President's directive to secure U.S. borders and protect American communities and citizens.”

However, despite the executive order saying events would be adjudicated upon by the State Department, a White House spokesperson told The Athletic that both the Gold Cup and Club World Cup are deemed major events. This appears to pave the way for Haiti to compete in the Gold Cup and also enables nationals from the banned countries to compete in their club teams during the Club World Cup.

There was less reassuring news, however, for supporters of these nations.

During a news conference, Pigott said: “I think both people that are coming and Americans would hope that we can have confidence that when people come to the United States, when they come, that they are properly vetted.

“I think this goes to the exact same consideration. I think that this is part of what it means to host an event of this magnitude, to make sure that we have that confidence. Again, we're in constant communication with countries about ways that we can see the vetting process we need to see, to have that collaboration and make sure that we're having those security concerns addressed. This is part of what it means to host an event. I believe people coming from all around the world, Americans going to these events, would want to see actions like this. We take security concerns extremely seriously. We want people to be able to go to the World Cup and do so safely.”

Trump's executive order describes Iran as a “state sponsor of terrorism,” alleging that the state “regularly fails to cooperate with the United States Government in identifying security risks.” Venezuelan nationals are accused of overstaying their visas at a rate of just under 10 per cent when visiting the country on a short-term tourist or business visas, while Trump's order claimed that “hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden Administration.”

Exemptions are made for individuals, such as Iranian dual citizens who are traveling with a passport from a non-banned country. There will also be entry granted to Iranians on immigrant visas owing to ethnic or religious persecution in their home country.

Elsewhere, the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) wrote late on Wednesday to all national governing sporting bodies across the U.S. with regards to what the organization described as “an evolving policy environment.”

The USOPC email, seen by The Athletic, came amid fears among some sports that their support staff or coaches could be impacted by the travel ban and their travel affected.

The email stated: “Importantly, a carveout has been secured for athletes and essential support personnel.”

It described this is as critical protection that will allow Team USA athletes, coaches, and operational staff to continue international travel in support of elite sport competition and qualification.

The Europa League winners have finally put their Australian head coach out of his misery - but who's the best man to replace him?

Ange Postecoglou has officially been relieved of his duties at Tottenham. That's a sentence most Spurs fans had been praying on for months as results and performances took a turn for the worse during a shambolic 2024-25 campaign.

However, victory over Manchester United in the Europa League final added some shades of grey to the situation, with Postecoglou having delivered on his promise to secure some silverware while earning a spot in next season's Champions League to boot. That that achievement came against the backdrop of a 17th-placed Premier League finish, though, has led to his time in north London being ended.

The Australian coach earned plenty of admirers for his attack-minded style of play in his first year at Spurs as he guided the team to a respectable fifth-placed finish in the league, but the drop-off over the past 12 months has, in the eyes of many, been unforgivable, and chairman Daniel Levy had little choice but to make a change.

In the end, Postecoglou's refusal to budge from his principles led to his downfall (along with a series of bizarre exchanges with supporters and the media). The question now is, who is the standout candidate for the job? GOAL ranks the main contenders below...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Alcaraz advances to Roland Garros final after Musetti retires","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alcaraz-musetti-roland-garros-2025-sf","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 15:11:23 GMT","

Carlos Alcaraz moved to within one victory of successfully defending his title at Roland Garros on Friday after Lorenzo Musetti retired in the fourth set of their semi-final clash.

The 22-year-old Spaniard led Musetti 4-6, 7-6(3), 6-0, 2-0 when the Italian ended the match after two hours, 25 minutes. At 0-5 in the third set, Musetti called for the physio to receive treatment on his upper left leg. After that, he continued reaching for his leg and was eventually unable to continue.

 “It's never great getting through or winning a match like this,” said Alcaraz in his on-court interview. “Lorenzo is a great player. He has had an incredible clay season. [He is] one of the few players who achieved at least the semi-finals at all the biggest events on clay. I think just four players had done that before… I always wish him all the best, a quick recovery, and hopefully we are going to enjoy his tennis pretty soon.”

Alcaraz is the fifth-youngest player to reach five Grand Slam finals in the Open Era, and third active male player to achieve that feat after Novak Djokovic (37) and Daniil Medvedev (6).

Competing under a closed roof on Court Philippe-Chatrier, Alcaraz signalled his intent with an aggressive position from the start: He stepped inside the baseline and struck big from both wings. Yet while Musetti produced an impressive response to soak up the power and take the opener, Alcaraz stuck to his game plan and eventually delivered some of his finest shot-making en route to consecutive finals at the clay-court major.

 “The first two sets were really tough,” said Alcaraz. “I had chances to break his serve in the match. I couldn't make the most of them. He was playing great tennis. When I won the second set, there was a little bit of relief, and then in the third set I knew what I had to do at the beginning: Just push him to the limit and try to be aggressive. Not let him dominate the game more and just be myself.

""I was calmer. I could see more clearly and could play great tennis at the beginning of the third set.”

Alcaraz improved to 6-1 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Musetti, including two wins en route to ATP Masters 1000 titles in Monte-Carlo and Rome this year. He now owns a 33-2 record on clay since last May, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Musetti can also reflect on a stellar clay swing this year, highlighted by becoming the fifth player to reach the semi-finals of all clay ATP Masters 1000 events and Roland Garros in the same year after Rafael Nadal, Djokovic, Andy Murray and Alexander Zverev.



Aiming to extend his perfect 4-0 record in Grand Slam finals, Alcaraz awaits the winner of Friday's second semi-final between the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Jannik Sinner and three-time champion Djokovic.

 “For sure, I'm not going to miss it,” said Alcaraz. “This match is one of the best matchups we have in tennis right now. Sinner against Djokovic, it's going to be great tennis. As a huge fan of tennis I'm going to watch it, I'm going to enjoy it. Obviously I'm going to take tactics from that match, but I think we are all going to enjoy that match because they are going to play great tennis.”

Carlos Alcaraz benefited from the abandonment of Lorenzo Musetti (4-6, 7-6 (3), 6-0, 2-0) on Friday afternoon and will face the winner of the match between Italian Jannik Sinner, the top seed, and Serb Novak Djokovic, the No 6 seed, for the title

Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, the second seed, moved into the final of Roland-Garros when Italian Lorenzo Musetti, the No 8 seed, retired at Roland-Garros in Paris on Friday afternoon.

Alcaraz, ranked No 2, led 4-6, 7-6 (3), 6-0, 2-0 when Musetti, ranked No 7, pulled out on Friday at Roland-Garros in Paris.

The 22-year-old Spaniard will play the winner of the match between Italian Jannik Sinner, the top seed, and Serb Novak Djokovic, the No 6 seed, next.

Carlos Alcaraz won against Italian qualifier Giulio Zeppieri (6-3, 6-4, 6-2), Hungarian Fabian Marozsan (6-1, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2), Bosnian Damir Dzumhur (6-1, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4), American Ben Shelton, the No 13 seed (7-6 (8), 6-3, 4-6, 6-4) and American Tommy Paul, the No 12 seed (6-0, 6-1, 6-4) earlier in the tournament.

In the previous rounds of the Roland-Garros 2025, the Italian beat German qualifier Yannick Hanfmann (7-5, 6-2, 6-0), Colombian lucky loser Daniel Elahi Galan (6-4, 6-0, 6-4), Argentinian Mariano Navone (4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2), Dane Holger Rune, the No 10 seed (7-5, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2) and American Frances Tiafoe, the No 15 seed (6-2, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2).

By Ariadna Pinheiro

He's one of the ATP's most fiery competitors, but Andrey Rublev's story goes beyond his thunderous forehand. The Moscow-born talent has carved out a space in tennis with a mix of intensity and raw emotion.

Raised in a family with sports roots, his journey from junior phenom to top-10 mainstay has been anything but predictable. With a coach who knows how to channel his passion, he's crafted a career full of highs—and a few meltdowns.

Off the court, glimpses into his private life reveal someone far more introspective than his on-court fire suggests. From rumored romances to his close bond with his mother, his world is rich with detail that goes well beyond the baseline.

Born on October 20, 1997, in Moscow, Russia, Andrey Rublev is 27 years old as of 2025. Since turning professional in 2014, he has steadily climbed the ATP rankings, reaching a career-high of World No. 5. His journey reflects a blend of youthful vigor and seasoned experience.

Andrey Rublev's physical attributes contribute significantly to his playing style. Standing at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 meters) and weighing approximately 165 pounds (75 kilograms), his height and athletic build provide him with a powerful serve and an aggressive baseline game.

Andrey Rublev has long kept his private life away from the spotlight, but subtle clues have begun to paint a clearer picture. For years, he's been romantically linked to Anastasija Homutova, a former Latvian tennis player.

The two met early in their tennis careers and were often seen supporting each other quietly, without the fanfare that usually follows celebrity relationships. In early 2025, rumors intensified after she changed her Instagram handle to @nastja.rubleva.

She further fueled speculation with a cryptic post referring to herself as “Mrs. Rubleva,” accompanied by photos of the couple together and a caption welcoming a “new chapter”.

Despite the hints, neither Rublev nor Homutova has made a formal announcement. The tennis world remains intrigued, but true to form, he continues to sidestep questions about his personal life.

Andrey Rublev didn't stumble into professional tennis; his path was paved by a family immersed in the world of sports. His mother, Marina Marenko, is a seasoned tennis coach who worked with prominent players at the Spartak Tennis Club in Moscow.

His father, Andrey Rublev Sr., comes from a different athletic background. A former professional boxer, he later transitioned into the restaurant business but passed down a strong competitive spirit to his son. 

The tennis connection doesn't end there. Rublev's half-sister, Anna Arina Marenko, was a promising tennis player herself, reaching a WTA career-high singles ranking of 411. Though she retired early from the sport, she remains closely involved in his journey, albeit from a distance.

Andrey Rublev's raw power on the court is shaped by a thoughtful coaching philosophy rooted in consistency, mental discipline, and strategic evolution. Since 2017, his primary coach has been Fernando Vicente, a former Spanish tennis pro and current ATP Coach of the Year nominee.

In April 2025, he made headlines by adding a new name to his team: Marat Safin. A former World No. 1 and Grand Slam champion, Safin brings a wealth of experience—and charisma—to Rublev's corner.

The announcement caught fans and analysts by surprise, especially since Safin has rarely taken coaching roles since his retirement. Rublev, who has long cited Safin as a childhood idol, expressed excitement at the new partnership.

The duo debuted together at the Monte Carlo Masters, with him stating that Safin's perspective on high-pressure matches could provide the mental edge he's been looking for. Whether the collaboration will translate to trophies remains to be seen, but it has certainly sparked renewed interest in his career arc.

19:02 CET - We are just minutes away from the second French Open semi-final of the day between world No. 1 Jannik Sinner and 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic. Both players are now taking to the court, and it promises to be an absolute thriller!

Follow the match live here.

17:07 CET - Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz is back into the French Open final after Lorenzo Musetti retired from their semi-final, trailing 6-4, 6-7(3), 6-0, 2-0. The Italian appeared to be struggling with a thigh injury towards the end, and is unable to continue. His fine clay-court season comes to a disappointing close.

Meanwhile, Alcaraz now stands on the verge of a fifth Grand Slam title and his second here, but he will certainly have to be better against either Jannik Sinner or Novak Djokovic in the final. The Spaniard was well off his best in the first two sets, playing inpatience tennis and making several errors. However, he has two days to get ready, and you can be sure he will be.

16:58 CET - Carlos Alcaraz has found top gear now, and has soared ahead to take the third set 6-0 against a Lorenzo Musetti who appears to be tiring. The Spaniard is fully in the driving seat now.

16:34 CET - It hasn't been vintage stuff at all from Carlos Alcaraz at Roland Garros, and he is making plenty of errors, but he has still managed to find a way to snatch the second set 7-6(3), and level proceedings against Lorenzo Musetti. When it really mattered, the Spaniard upped his game in the tiebreak, against an opponent who is playing extremely well.

15:29 CET - Well, hello there! Lorenzo Musetti has broken in the final game of the set to take the opener 6-4 against Carlos Alcaraz. A solid set for the Italian to win it, with a solid serve and good play at the net.

14:34 CET - Carlos Alcaraz and Lorenzo Musetti are out on the court warming up, with the start of the first semi-final just minutes away.

Follow the match live here.

12:00 CET - Welcome back to the Tennis Tracker this Friday afternoon, with a pair of seismic semi-final clashes on the cards at the French Open.

Up first at 14:30 CET, defending champion Carlos Alcaraz takes on Lorenzo Musetti, who has enjoyed a stunning clay-court season, reaching at least the semi-finals at every event.

Alcaraz will definitely go into the match as the favourite and has beaten Musetti on the clay of Monte Carlo and Rome in the last few months. He also leads the head-to-head 5-1. However, the Italian is playing the best tennis of his career and will be targeting an upset.

That will be followed by a massive meeting between world number one Jannik Sinner and three-time French Open champion Novak Djokovic.

For the first time in a while, Djokovic goes in as the big underdog. He has done a remarkable job getting to the semi-finals at 38 years old and with not much form this season, but will this be a step too far? However, write off the legendary Serb at your peril, and he will certainly have a plan for Sinner.

Sinner has been utterly relentless this tournament, not yet dropping a set and swatting aside all his opponents with ease. But this will certainly be his biggest test, and if he is slightly off his best, Djokovic will do everything to make him pay.","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","tennis"

Carlos Alcaraz moved to within one victory of successfully defending his title at Roland Garros on Friday after Lorenzo Musetti retired in the fourth set of their semi-final clash.

The 22-year-old Spaniard led Musetti 4-6, 7-6(3), 6-0, 2-0 when the Italian ended the match after two hours, 25 minutes. At 0-5 in the third set, Musetti called for the physio to receive treatment on his upper left leg. After that, he continued reaching for his leg and was eventually unable to continue.

 “It's never great getting through or winning a match like this,” said Alcaraz in his on-court interview. “Lorenzo is a great player. He has had an incredible clay season. [He is] one of the few players who achieved at least the semi-finals at all the biggest events on clay. I think just four players had done that before… I always wish him all the best, a quick recovery, and hopefully we are going to enjoy his tennis pretty soon.”

Alcaraz is the fifth-youngest player to reach five Grand Slam finals in the Open Era, and third active male player to achieve that feat after Novak Djokovic (37) and Daniil Medvedev (6).

Competing under a closed roof on Court Philippe-Chatrier, Alcaraz signalled his intent with an aggressive position from the start: He stepped inside the baseline and struck big from both wings. Yet while Musetti produced an impressive response to soak up the power and take the opener, Alcaraz stuck to his game plan and eventually delivered some of his finest shot-making en route to consecutive finals at the clay-court major.

 “The first two sets were really tough,” said Alcaraz. “I had chances to break his serve in the match. I couldn't make the most of them. He was playing great tennis. When I won the second set, there was a little bit of relief, and then in the third set I knew what I had to do at the beginning: Just push him to the limit and try to be aggressive. Not let him dominate the game more and just be myself.

""I was calmer. I could see more clearly and could play great tennis at the beginning of the third set.”

Alcaraz improved to 6-1 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Musetti, including two wins en route to ATP Masters 1000 titles in Monte-Carlo and Rome this year. He now owns a 33-2 record on clay since last May, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Musetti can also reflect on a stellar clay swing this year, highlighted by becoming the fifth player to reach the semi-finals of all clay ATP Masters 1000 events and Roland Garros in the same year after Rafael Nadal, Djokovic, Andy Murray and Alexander Zverev.



Aiming to extend his perfect 4-0 record in Grand Slam finals, Alcaraz awaits the winner of Friday's second semi-final between the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Jannik Sinner and three-time champion Djokovic.

 “For sure, I'm not going to miss it,” said Alcaraz. “This match is one of the best matchups we have in tennis right now. Sinner against Djokovic, it's going to be great tennis. As a huge fan of tennis I'm going to watch it, I'm going to enjoy it. Obviously I'm going to take tactics from that match, but I think we are all going to enjoy that match because they are going to play great tennis.”

            It's crunch time in Paris as we reach the business end of the French Open.
    


            World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka came through a battle against four-time winner and defending champion Iga Świątek to make the women's final where she will face American star Coco Gauff, who ended Lois Boisson's Cinderella story.
    


            Meanwhile, in the men's draw, Carlos Alcaraz defeated Italian star Lorenzo Musetti to make it to the final, while 24-time grand slam champion Novak Djokovic is set to clash with world No. 1 Jannik Sinner.
    


            We look set for another memorable weekend of action on the iconic red clay of Roland Garros.
    


            Here's everything you need to know about one of the world's oldest tennis tournaments:
    


            Starting out as the “French Clay-Court Championships” in 1891 – allowing only players from France to compete – the French Open was officially created in 1925 when foreign players were first invited.
    


            In 1927, a new arena was purpose built for France's defense of its 1927 Davis Cup title and named after Roland Garros – not a sportsman, but a pioneering French aviator who was killed in World War I.
    


            The French Open is one of tennis' four grand slam tournaments along with Wimbledon, the US Open and the Australian Open – and the only one played on clay.
    


            But are the courts really made of clay? The answer is not much.
    


            Clay makes up just a small part of the tennis court, with 1-2 millimeters of crushed red bricks giving them their famous red hue.
    


            Playing on clay is considerably different to playing on grass or hard courts.
    


            Clay is more physically demanding as it is the slowest of the three surfaces, producing longer rallies, more running and more shots.
    


            Grueling five-set matches on clay can push players close to their physical limits.

Roland Garros: Why is clay the most difficult surface to play on?



            Matches on clay are also sometimes referred to as chess matches, where a well-placed shot can set up a winner two or three shots later.
    


            Clay also has considerably more friction than grass or hard courts, allowing the ball to grip to the dust and bounce much higher, in particular shots with heavy topspin.
    


            Even for a player as accomplished as Novak Djokovic, one of the sport's all-time greats, clay continues to be a tricky surface to master.
    


            “It's a very demanding surface,” Djokovic said after recently winning his first clay court match since completing the “Golden Slam” at the Paris Olympics.
    


            “We all know how tricky it is to play on clay; compared to the other surfaces, you always have to expect an extra one or two shots, balls coming back.”
    


            While Roland Garros is considered the pinnacle of the clay season, there are many other ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) and WTA (Women's Tennis Association) tournaments played on the red dust.
    


            This year, there are 18 tournaments scheduled to be played on clay in the ATP Tour, while the women will play 11 clay court tournaments in 2025.
    


            But hard court is still the most popular surface on both tours in 2025. Hard court is also favored by US players as most of the American tournaments are played on that surface.
    


            While some smaller tournaments pay the male winner more than female players, all four grand slams offer equal prize money. The US Open was the first to award both tournament winners equal money in 1973 – something championed by Billie Jean King.
    


            The Australian Open followed suit 11 years later, offering men and women equal pay but reverted to paying men more in 1996. In 2001, they reversed course again and offered both men's and women's winners $440,000.
    


            Roland Garros implemented equal pay in 2006, and one year later Wimbledon committed to equal pay. Today, the four slams offer equal pay for each round of the draw.
    


            The last time Rafael Nadal – the most accomplished tennis player in history on clay – won the tournament was in 2023.
    


            In November 2024, the “King of Clay” played his final match of professional tennis when Spain lost in the Davis Cup. With 22 grand slams in his pocket – including a record 14 French Opens – we look at the new generation of tennis players who perform well on the red stuff.
    


            Will we ever see someone match Nadal's achievements on clay?
    


            What makes the French Open different to the other grand slams?
    


            With Paris being the fashion capital of the world, players have debuted some eye-catching outfits at Roland Garros.
    


            This year, Olympic gold medalist Zheng Qinwen modeled a unique calf-length pleated skirt – inspired by Suzanne Lenglen's iconic style – though she said she is “too shy” to wear it on the court.

            However, the most famous of all the Roland Garros outfits has to be Serena Williams' superhero-esque ‘catsuit' she wore in 2018 just months after giving birth to her first child.
    


            The glitz and glamor of the tournament also draws celebrities from all walks of life, with singer/producer/composer Pharrell Williams, actor Ben Stiller and three-time Formula One world drivers champion Jackie Stewart among those in attendance last year.
    


            The French Open crowd is also known for being among the most boisterous on the tennis calendar.
    


            The famous chant taken from the pasodoble “En Er Mundo” can be heard across Roland Garros throughout the tournament's two weeks.
    


            Somebody in the crowd will sing “Popopopopopopo pololoooo!” with the rest of the arena responding with an: “Olééé!”
    


            We are guaranteed to see a brand new winner of the women's title – who will see their name etched in history this weekend: Sabalenka or Gauff?
    


            In the men's draw, can Alcaraz become the first man to go back-to-back since his idol Nadal in 2020, will Sinner win his first French Open or will Djokovic further extend his grand slam record?

Last June as a 15-year-old wild card, Hannah Klugman made it to the final round of Wimbledon qualifying on a surface British players traditionally prefer.Nearly twelve months later, Klugman has posted her best junior singles result across the English Channel on red clay. Seeded No. 8 in the Roland Garros girls' event, the now 16-year-old finds herself two wins away from lifting the trophy.“Everyone says the Brits don't like the clay. But I actually really like it!” Klugman told Prakash Amritraj on Tennis Channel.“I think it really suits my game. Me and my coach this year, we said let's do a long bloc on clay. We've done two months and I'm really loving it. I'm not ready to get off yet and go to grass.”

As Klugman navigates the external noise that comes with an upward trajectory in the sport, a compatriot of note is ready to guide her through it all. Earlier this year, world No. 5 Jack Draper had lunch with his fellow Londoner and encouraged Klugman to reach out when she needs a hand.“We go through a lot of mentally tough times. Last year, I kind of struggled a bit. He spoke to me a lot,” Klugman shared. “He had a time when he also struggled.“He really helped me and he's been someone who's always there. He said to me, ‘whenever you need help, I'm here for you.' That was really nice.”

Top 25-ranked juniors Mika Stojsavljevic (No. 6) and Mingge “Mimi” Xu (No. 24) provide plenty of local competition to ensure no one feels alone in the path being taken.“I think it's pretty cool. I love it. I'm still young, I'm enjoying it. It's a long journey, I've realized,” said Klugman, who has also contested a pair of junior Grand Slam doubles finals. “I just take it in my stride and I'm excited. We've got an amazing bunch of juniors right now. We definitely push each other to be better.”A stretch of play on home soil awaits after Paris, with her backyard tournament waiting in the wings. A good time with her friends and another chat with Draper just may be on the calendar of events, too.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Why Lois Boisson's Wimbledon dreams may be dashed","https://www.tennis365.com/tennis-news/lois-boisson-frozen-out-wimbledon-rankings-rise","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 16:53:33 GMT","

Lois Boisson served up one of the stories of the Roland Garros with her remarkable run to the semi-finals in her first Grand Slam final, but it may not be enough to get her into Wimbledon.

Boisson is set to rise almost 300 places up the WTA Rankings after her heroics in Paris and she is set to rise to around No 65 in the updated rankings on Monday.

However, the cut-off point for direct entry into the third Grand Slam title of the year passed a month ago and Boisson was a long way from direct entry into the draw at the All England Club at that point.

Boisson will now hope her heroics at Roland Garros will encourage Wimbledon chiefs to hand her a wildcard into their tournament, but a more likely scenario may see her get a chance to play in qualifying.

That would leave her needing to win three matches to reach the main draw at Wimbledon, but the good news is she will feel the full impact of her Roland Garros run once we get to the American hard court swing on the WTA Tour.

John McEnroe gives Lois Boisson verdict and admits he ‘liked' anger from her French Open rival

She will have a chance to play in some upcoming WTA 1000 events and should gain direct entry to the US Open, which will give Boisson a chance to make further rises up the WTA Rankings.

Despite her defeat against Gauff, Boisson left Roland Garros with her career transformed and she was already looking towards what comes next.

“I'm just going to take the time to digest this and then we'll see afterwards. But, no, it will probably not take very long (to get over it).

“She played really, really good. She was just too good for me today, and that's it.

“I just feel like I was running everywhere on the court today, so it was really tough. She was really solid, and I couldn't play my game today because she was just too good.

“This week was very positive for me. It's just that today it was quite simply too tough for me. I couldn't manage to get my game going, but apart from today's match… the tournament as a whole was very positive.

“Even today, there are a few positives even if there aren't many.

“We know that particular injury is very complicated, but at the beginning, yes, I kind of lost faith because I didn't know what was to come next, and I didn't know that things could go so well,” reflected Boisson.

“I was really worried at one point, but you know, as the rehabilitation progressed, I realised that things are getting better. In the end, what's happening today is great.”

Boisson's boost in confidence on the court will be enhanced by the riches coming her way off it, with the Roland Garros semi-final appearance earning her €690,000.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Judy Murray makes prediction over Andy Murray coaching role ahead of Wimbledon","https://metro.co.uk/2025/06/06/judy-murray-makes-prediction-andy-murray-coaching-role-ahead-wimbledon-23345360/","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 08:38:00 GMT","

Judy Murray doesn't believe her son Andy Murray will take up a new coaching role ahead of Wimbledon after his split with Novak Djokovic.

Djokovic and Murray announced the end of their partnership last month despite the Serbian previously stating that he hoped to continue working with the British legend through the French Open and Wimbledon this year.

Some fans were hoping to see Murray form a dream team with Emma Raducanu but that looks to be unlikely ahead of this year's Championships with Mark Petchey set for a bigger role during the 2025 grass-court swing.

Three-time major winner Murray has previously named Raducanu as a player he'd love to coach one day along with British No.1 Jack Draper, Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz and Greek star Stefanos Tsitsipas.

But his mother Judy doesn't think her son is ‘ready to jump straight back into coaching' and suggested he may take some time away from tennis.

‘Andy had just retired and wasn't looking to go into coaching but he stepped in because Novak asked him,' she told The Herald.

‘When they joined-up, I was certainly interested to see how he got on being on the other side of things and realising how stressful it can be.

Djokovic had been in poor form all season ahead of the French Open, which is currently ongoing, and it seems he made the change to boost his chances of a strong performance at Roland-Garros.

The Murray split appears to have paid off after Djokovic booked his spot in the French Open semi-finals on Wednesday with an impressive win over Alexander Zverev, who was the runner-up in Paris last year.

Read statements from Murray and Djokovic here about their split.

‘I don't think he's ready to jump straight back into coaching, though, because the tennis circuit is relentless.

‘I can see him doing a consultant type role with young players and he's already done a lot of mentoring with the British players on the men's side who are coming through but I can't see him being a full-time tennis coach.

‘There's more to life than jumping straight back into the tennis rat race after nearly 20 years as a player. 

‘I don't think he'll necessarily want to jump back onto that merry-go-round – not when you're someone who's got four kids to taxi around and you want to get your golf handicap to scratch.

‘Whether he does it in the future, I don't know – that's for him to answer and I actually don't think he knows the answer either but my guess is not right now.'

Since his retirement from tennis after the Olympic Games in Paris last year, Murray has spent lots of time on the golf course.

Murray made his Pro-Am debut at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth in September, teaming up with fellow Scot Robert MacIntyre.

‘For someone that's not really played that much, I thought he was good,' MacIntyre said about Murray's golfing skills. ‘I was very impressed with his game.'

Murray regularly posts videos and pictures of himself playing golf across his social media accounts and has become a member at Beaverbrook Golf Club in Surrey.

The former world No.1 tennis star signed his first golf equipment deal earlier this year, becoming a brand ambassador for Callaway.

Murray, who appeared at this year's French Open for Rafael Nadal's farewell ceremony, could now be set for a golfing reunion with his former Spanish rival.

 Catch all the US Open tennis action at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York City. lev radin/Shutterstock 

Visitors to New York City are spoiled for choice when it comes to world-class events: this is a town that knows how to put on a show. One of the city's many major moments each year – the US Open Tennis Championships – takes place in Queens for two weeks on either side of Labor Day. It's a spectacle I've been lucky enough to attend for several years, and I promise that despite the price tag, few marquee experiences are as rewarding.

The US Open is a fortnight of Grand Slam tennis in the city that never sleeps and is one of the most vibrant and visceral sporting events on Earth. Where else can you watch matches into the wee hours of the morning alongside bonafide movie stars and bigwigs, with a boisterous and vocal crowd that hangs on every point? Professional tennis players agree this is the most exciting and electric tournament on the tour. Even if you don't normally watch tennis, attending the US Open is an energizing experience. There's also much to do and see off the courts; the local food offerings alone are worth the trip to Flushing Meadows. 

Here's everything you need to know about New York's Grand Slam tournament.

The tournament takes place from late August to early September, and 2025 is the first year with a Sunday start, on August 24, allowing tennis fans to see first-round action without having to take a day off work. The matches go on for two weeks, day and night, culminating in the finals on September 6 and 7. The day sessions begin at 11am, while the evening sessions kick off at 7pm.

All events take place at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, New York. 

Tickets to the US Open cost a lot of money. And all the sessions sell out almost immediately after going on sale, leaving only marked-up resale tickets on Ticketmaster. I won't say there's no way to get non-resale, face-value tickets – but that has been my experience. Other online ticket vendors, such as SeatGeek and StubHub, also offer resale tickets. It's best to shop around, and definitely make sure any ticket vendor guarantees the veracity and existence of the tickets. 

To give an idea of prices, a first-round grounds pass for the day session (which means you can access outer courts and smaller stadiums on a first-come-first-serve basis) is currently hovering around $350 (originally selling for $175), but prices can, though rarely do, fluctuate.

The deeper you get into the tournament – or if you wish to get assigned seating in one of the three stadiums – the more you'll have to pay. It can get, frankly, ridiculous and infuriating. What's worse is that after you pony up double what tickets originally cost, you'll see an ungodly abundance of empty seats, especially in the early rounds. DO BETTER, US OPEN!

If money is no object, check out On Location, which specializes in hospitality offerings, such as individual courtside seats and access to a luxury box.

Pro tip: There is a way to experience the Open without dropping a dime: Fan Week. The week before the action starts, anyone can visit the grounds at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and get a taste of the action. While there are no matches, you can catch Carlos Alcaraz, Jessica Pegula, Ben Shelton, Iga Świątek and all the big-name star players practicing on all the courts. 

Night sessions are where the fire is, and they get more boisterous as the tournament progresses. I prefer day sessions during the early rounds, and I recommend arriving early because lines can be long. Doors open at 9:30am during the tournament and at 10am during Fan Week.

Few options are more convenient than hotels near Flushing, Queens. Those hotels usually sell out early, but keep an eye out for cancellations. Alternatively, you can stay in Manhattan and commute via subway. Airbnb and short-term rentals have been all but outlawed (unless the host is there), so hotels or crashing with friends or family are your best bet. 

I usually suggest the NH Collection near Grand Central Station to people who come in from out of town. It's a generally affordable, convenient, well-appointed 4-star hotel that isn't on many travelers' radars. Rooms hover around $300–400 per night, for two nights early in the tournament. That may sound pricey, but by Manhattan standards it's a good deal. Our New York City guidebook also recommends the chic Boro Hotel in Long Island City. 

For something more unique, NYC has some charming B&Bs, including the Black-owned Akwaaba Mansion in Brooklyn, that can give you a taste of local life as well as a memorable, personalized stay. 

Could you drive or take an Uber? Yes. But real New Yorkers take the 7 train to Mets-Willets Point (Citi Field is here, too) to get to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows. From Grand Central Station, it takes about 45 minutes and a short walk over a pedestrian bridge will bring you to the entrance. This is NYC at its best.

Bring as little as possible to remain unencumbered and whiz through the security checks. I carry only my phone (it doubles as my wallet), a spare charger, a hat, sunglasses and my fave liquid 50 SPF sunscreen (no spray cans allowed) to prevent my skin from burning. Stuff all of it into your pockets if possible, and if you need to bring a bag (no backpacks), you may have to put up with a longer line for it to go through the security screening – bags need to be small (12” W x 12” H x 16” L).

There are so many wonderful things to eat and drink at the Open, and it's all pretty pricey (nothing about tennis is cheap). They change up the purveyors every year, but they're all local: try a Fuku fried chicken sandwich, a lobster roll from Red Hook Lobster Pound, or cool off with some Van Leeuwen Ice Cream (the affogato cream is my favorite). 

If you're a drinker, you must order a Honey Deuce, the tournament's signature cocktail made with Grey Goose vodka, lemonade, raspberry liqueur and a spear of three tennisy melon balls,  served in a commemorative plastic cup – it's the perfect souvenir. Or you can opt for an Aperol spritz from the eponymous stand near the outer courts.

You can pay to store luggage prior to entering the grounds if you're arriving at the Tennis Center before you can drop your gear. 

Chase cardholders can borrow mobile phone chargers, and American Express cardholders get portable radios that wrap around your ear, so you can hear the televised commentary. 

Expect large crowds on the grounds. It can be difficult to navigate, so get your bearings before you arrive, download the US Open app with the grounds map and decide what matches you want to see and the courts on which they'll be played.

You can only enter certain courts at certain intervals during each match, so don't get frustrated if you're held back from entering. 

Finally (and this is probably not encouraged), after the day session, I stay on the grounds and perch myself outside Arthur Ashe (the center court of the US Open) to watch the first few games of the evening session from the main plaza, Honey Deuce in hand. This is how I watched Serina Williams' final professional match, along with a large crowd of fans, and it is one of my favorite moments of any tournament I've ever attended.

The second grand slam of the year is ongoing at Roland-Garros. The 2025 French Open has reached the men's semifinals. Defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz has made it through to the semis. Defending champ Iga Swiatek was knocked out in her semis match by the top seed of the women's tournament, Aryna Sabalenka — who will face No. 2 Coco Gauff in the women's final this Saturday. In the U.S., coverage of this year's tournament is airing on TNT and truTV, and every match is streaming live on HBO Max.

Are you ready to watch the men's semis at the French Open? Here's how to follow all the action down on the clay courts at Roland-Garros.

Dates: May 25 - June 8

Time: Play starts daily at 5 a.m. ET

Location: Stade Roland-Garros

TV channel: TNT, truTV

Streaming: HBO Max

The 2025 French Open will take place between May 25 and June 8. Singles play begins May 25, with the men's final closing things out on June 8.

Thanks to the time difference between the U.S. and France, the tennis tournament at Roland-Garros will start daily play at 5 a.m. ET/3 a.m. PT.

In a shift from last year, the 2025 Roland-Garros tennis tournament will air across TNT and truTV — with all matches streaming on Max (soon to be officially re-named HBO Max).

Disney

The Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle gets you exactly what it sounds like: access to Disney+, Hulu and Max. If you go ad-free ($29.99/month) you'll save up to 38% off compared to individually paying for all three services — and gain access to all French Open coverage. 

If you don't already have access to these platforms, this is a great option that really covers your bases, streaming-wise. You'll get access to three vast libraries, fully stocked with everything MCU, all those Disney princesses (new and old), Hulu's robust catalog of shows on-demand the day after they air, including the latest episodes of Abbott Elementary, Grey's Anatomy and more, and the most recent seasons of The Last of Us, The Pitt and White Lotus.

 

While Sling doesn't offer a free trial these days, the tournament will last longer than any free trial anyway. With Sling Blue, you can get access to French Open coverage on TNT and truTV. 

Sling also has an option to bundle Max in with your Sling Orange + Blue subscription and save $5 on the overall price, in case you want to watch games via Max and take advantage of all the channels offered in the Sling Orange + Blue combo package. 

If you want to catch every match of the French Open and don't currently subscribe to HBO Max or a live TV streaming service, in Australia a majority of the action is streaming free with ads on 9Now, and in Austria it's all streaming free with ads on ServusTV.

Don't live in either of those places? Don't worry, you can still stream like you do with the help of a VPN. A VPN (virtual private network) helps protect your data, can mask your IP address and is perhaps most popular for being especially useful in the age of streaming. Whether you're looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to next F1 race without a cable package, a VPN can help you out. Looking to try a VPN for the first time? This guide breaks down the best VPN options for every kind of user.

 

ExpressVPN offers “internet without borders,” meaning you can tune into an Austrian or Australian livestream this month as opposed to paying for another streaming subscription. All you'll need to do is sign up for ExpressVPN, change your server location and then find free livestream coverage on 9Now or ServusTV. 

ExpressVPN's added protection, speed and range of location options make it an excellent choice for first-time VPN users looking to stretch their streaming abilities, plus, it's Engadget's top pick for the best streaming VPN. New users can save 61% when they sign up for ExpressVPN's 2-year subscription. Plus, the service offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, in case you're nervous about trying a VPN.

Coco Gauff's first Grand Slam title came at the 2023 U.S. Open by beating Aryna Sabalenka in the final

PARIS — The biggest difference Coco Gauff sees between the player who lost her first Grand Slam final at the 2022 French Open at age 18 , and the one who will play for the trophy again on Saturday at 21, this time against No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, is the way she views the importance of the occasion.

Three years ago at Roland-Garros , Gauff was making her debut on that sort of stage and with that sort of prize at stake. It felt like the outcome meant absolutely everything, a burden that was a lot at the time and made her nervous.

Now, the No. 2-ranked Gauff says, she understands “how miniscule” the result Saturday is in the scheme of things.

“Everybody is dealing with way bigger things in life than losing a final,” the American said after beating 361st-ranked French wild-card entry Loïs Boisson 6-1, 6-2 in the semifinals Thursday.

“I'm sure there are hundreds of players that would kill to win or lose a final, so just knowing that (makes) me realize how lucky and privileged I am to be in this position,” Gauff said. “At first, I thought it would be the end of the world if I lost, and, you know, the sun still rose the next day. ... Regardless of the result, the sun will still rise.”

Here's another key difference: The Gauff of today is a Grand Slam champion. She won the 2023 U.S. Open ; her opponent in that final just so happened to be Sabalenka.

“I just remember kind of feeling,” Gauff said, “like I was holding my breath to the match point.”

Their head-to-head series is tied 5-5 entering the first No. 1 vs. No. 2 matchup in a French Open women's final since Serena Williams beat Maria Sharapova in 2023.

Sabalenka beat Gauff in their most recent meeting, which came at the Madrid Open in May on the type of red clay used at Roland-Garros. So Gauff is well aware of Sabalenka's many talents, which were on full display during a 7-6 (1), 4-6, 6-0 semifinal victory over three-time defending champion Iga Swiatek .

“She can come up with some big shots and big winners pretty much at all areas of the court,” Gauff said about the 27-year-old from Belarus. “She's a fighter, as well. She's going to stay in the match regardless of the scoreline.”

After getting pushed to a third set by Swiatek, who had won 26 matches in a row at the French Open, Sabalenka was pretty much perfect down the stretch.

Even Sabalenka called the lopsided nature of that last set “shocking for me.”

She didn't make a single unforced error; Swiatek had 12.

“The pace was from her (was) super fast,” Swiatek said. “It was just hard to get into any rally.”

Sabalenka took over the top ranking from Swiatek last October and has remained there. Sabalenka is 40-6 this season with three titles and, while her three major championships all came on hard courts — at the 2023 and 2024 Australian Opens and the 2024 U.S. Open — the work she's put in to improve on clay is clearly paying off.

“I can go flat. I can (play) with the spin. I can go back and play in defense,” Sabalenka said. “That's what works the best on the clay court for me.”

The truth is, regardless of the surface, Sabalenka still appears to be most comfortable when she hits the ball as hard as possible.

Her high-risk style offers a contrast to Gauff, who has been making an effort to be more aggressive with her forehand but usually is at her best when she is making opponents hit shot after shot because she can get to everything with her speed, instincts and defense.

“She's going to come out swinging,” Gauff said. “I just have to expect that and do my best to kind of counter that.”

Jim Courier enjoyed a legendary tennis career, reaching world number one and winning multiple Grand Slam titles.

Competing for 12 years between 1988 and 2000, Courier won four Grand Slam titles and held the number one ranking for 58 weeks.

Courier won the Australian Open and French Open twice, but fell short in his sole final appearances at Wimbledon and the US Open.

Retiring in 2000, Courier began working as a commentator shortly after, sharing his opinions on the sport with fans around the world.

He did just that during Novak Djokovic's win over Alexander Zverev on Wednesday night, as the American selected the greatest single game of tennis he'd ever seen.

During his commentary of Djokovic's quarterfinal win at the 2025 French Open, Courier named the greatest game of tennis he'd seen.

“We shouldn't really be surprised that we've seen some of the most breathtaking single points between these two players,” he said.

“The single greatest game that I've ever seen played in tennis was these two guys in the semi-finals of the US Open in 2021.

“[Alexander] Zverev serving to stay in the set at that point, one set apiece. 

“There was an 18-shot rally, 32, a 12-shot rally, a 21-shot rally, a 53-shot rally, and finally [Novak] Djokovic broke serve on a 17-shot rally to take the set.

“He would win it in five sets, but I've never seen a game that competitive before or since. It was astonishing, the physicality, the emotion, it was a privilege to witness it.

“You think about the greatest round of boxing you've ever seen, this was the tennis version.”

On set point at *4-5, 15-40, Zverev and Djokovic battled it out in one of the greatest points of Grand Slam tennis you will ever see.

The pair hit the ball ferociously for over a minute before a thunderous forehand from Zverev won the marathon 53-shot rally.

It was going to be tough to top that, but Zverev and Djokovic certainly came close during their French Open quarterfinal match.

Down break point in the fourth set against Zverev, Djokovic proved why many consider him to be the greatest of all time.

After 38 brutal shots, Djokovic hit a beautiful drop shot which his German rival did well to retrieve.

Zverev's return gave Djokovic a great chance to hit a forehand, an opportunity he grasped as he saved the break point. 

Commentator John McEnroe couldn't quite believe what he'd seen.

“I've got goosebumps just watching these two dig deep right there,” he said.

McEnroe wasn't the only one to be impressed by the point as fans took to X to share their thoughts.

Wow. Just wow. 41 shot rally that had pretty much everything. And on BP!

“Wow. Just wow,” said one fan.

“41-shot rally that had pretty much everything, and on break point.”

“Unreal, mind-boggling, jaw-dropping 41-shot rally to save a break point,” added another.

“Novak Djokovic is 38 years old, playing a 28-year-old. Beyond crazy.”

Djokovic with that 41-shot rally to save break point. He never gives up.

“Djokovic with that 41-shot rally to save a break point. He never gives up,” said another fan.

“That 41-shot rally shows why tennis is pure art. Not just about power, it's footwork, stamina, and pure grit. Djokovic's mental toughness in these marathon points is what separates champions from contenders,” said one fan on X. 

Djokovic went on to win the match in four sets, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4, booking his place in the semi-finals where he'll take on Jannik Sinner.

Sinner and Djokovic will face off for a place in the French Open final on Friday, June 6.

Novak Djokovic and Jannik Sinner have each beat each other four times, including one win each in grand slam semifinals. They'll have a shot of breaking that tie in the French Open semifinal Friday at 1 p.m. ET. 

Sinner vs. Djokovic will air nationally on TNT, and can be streamed live on DirecTV (free trial).

Here's what you need to know:

Here's a recent tennis story from the Associated Press:

PARIS (AP) — A crucial moment arrived more than 2 1/2 hours into Novak Djokovic's 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 French Open quarterfinal victory over Alexander Zverev. It was the fourth set, and Djokovic led, but Zverev was in possession of a break point and a chance to get back into Wednesday's match.

They engaged in a 41-stroke exchange, the longest of a buggy and breezy night, and Djokovic came out on top, smacking a forehand winner. He stayed in place afterward, breathing heavily, with hands on hips, scanning the standing ovation from thousands of Court Philippe-Chatrier spectators. He soon held serve for a 4-2 lead in that set and was back on track.

Djokovic might be 38 now. He might have slogged through a pair of three-match losing skids this season and slid to No. 6 in the rankings. What hasn't changed is Djokovic's determination or his ability to be his best on big stages — and now he's two wins from a record 25th Grand Slam title.

Djokovic proved too much for No. 3 seed Zverev, a man who's a decade younger and was last year's runner-up at Roland-Garros, and set up a semifinal against No. 1 Jannik Sinner.

Djokovic is pleased to show himself, and others, he's still got it

“I still push myself on a daily basis at this age because of these kind of matches and these kind of experiences,” Djokovic said. “It's a proven kind of testament to myself that I can — and to others that I can — still play on the highest level.”

Earlier Wednesday, Sinner continued his overpowering run through the bracket by dismissing Alexander Bublik 6-1, 7-5, 6-0. Sinner not only hasn't dropped a set so far, but he has ceded a total of only 36 games through five matches.

So Friday will bring a tantalizing showdown between someone many consider the top player in tennis history, Djokovic, and someone who is at the top of the men's game at the moment, Sinner. They are tied 4-4 head-to-head; Sinner won the last three matchups.

“He has shown now, in the last period, that he is back,” Sinner said.

Djokovic has 24 major titles, and Sinner has won 3 of the past 5

No one has spent more weeks at No. 1 in the rankings than Djokovic. No one has won more major championships or reached more major semifinals than his total that now stands at 51 after becoming the second-oldest man to get that far in Paris. He also just claimed his 100th career tournament title, a week before the French Open.

“I just hope that I will be able to physically keep up with Sinner in few days' time,” Djokovic said. “It's a big challenge for me.”

Sinner, 23, has won three of the past five Grand Slam titles. That includes last year's U.S. Open and this year's Australian Open.

“He's playing fast. He's playing smart,” Bublik said. “He's in another dimension with all the aspects of the game.”

Also an apt description for Djokovic, who repeatedly used drop shots to great effect against Zverev.

As for Sinner, no one other than Carlos Alcaraz has been able to beat him in his last 48 matches, a stretch that dates to last August. Sinner is 46-2 in that span, with both defeats coming against the French Open's defending champion.

And as it happens, No. 2 Alcaraz is still around. He will meet No. 8 Lorenzo Musetti in Friday's other semifinal.

Djokovic and Zverev were both bothered by bugs during their match

There were some distractions in Djokovic vs. Zverev, including a bunch of tiny flying insects that the players kept trying to swat away and a back-and-forth between the chair umpire and some fans in the fourth set.

Needless to say, Djokovic handled it all much better. He also was superior in pretty much every way with the ball in play.

He was broken in the very first game — and then not again.

He broke Zverev four times — no small feat against a guy broken a total of five times in his five previous matches.

“What do you want me to say? He's won 24 of these things,” Zverev said.

The last time these two played each other was in the Australian Open semifinals in January, and Djokovic had to quit after one set because of an injured hamstring. The last time Djokovic played at the French Open, 12 months ago, he had to withdraw before the quarterfinals because he tore the meniscus in his right knee and needed surgery.

He sure looks in good shape at the moment.

Three years after she appeared in her first Roland Garros final, Coco Gauff is a changed player.

No longer a teenager and now a Grand Slam champion herself, the American superstar approaches her third major final with far more belief and experience.

She set up a blockbuster world No.1 v No.2 final against Aryna Sabalenka after ending the unforgettable run of Frenchwoman Lois Boisson.

Earlier on Thursday, Sabalenka snapped Iga Swiatek's 26-match win streak at the tournament, ending the Pole's shot at an historic fourth consecutive title.

Sabalenka may have done Gauff a favour.

The world No.1 is the game's dominant force and into her seventh final this season already, but it's Swiatek who Gauff has struggled with in Paris.

Swiatek ended her tournament in the 2022 final, 2023 quarterfinals and 2024 semifinals; the last time Gauff lost to anyone else was to eventual champion Barbora Krejcikova in 2021.

“My first final here I was super nervous, and I kind of wrote myself off before the match even happened,” she remembered of the 6-1 6-3 defeat, which left her in tears.

“Obviously here [this year] I have a lot more confidence just from playing a Grand Slam final before and doing well in one.

“I think going into Saturday I'll just give it my best shot and try to be as calm and relaxed as possible.”

Gauff's next major final came just over a year later where she faced Sabalenka, recovering from a set down and riding vociferous crowd support to win her first Grand Slam title.



It capped a magical US summer hardcourt swing, given she also won the Washington DC and Cincinnati titles.

Yet in a revealing interview, she expressed surprise at winning her first major title in New York.

“I never thought US Open would have been where it would happen,” she laughed in a Tennis Channel appearance. “I always thought it would have been Roland Garros, because all my best results have been on clay.”

The facts and figures show exactly that – Roland Garros is by far her best Slam.

Gauff's weekend win over Ekaterina Alexandrova propelled her into a fifth consecutive French quarterfinal, making her the youngest woman to reach five consecutive quarterfinals at the same Slam since Venus Williams at the 2001 US Open.

It also meant more than half of her nine career Slam quarterfinal showings have come at Roland Garros alone.

With her semifinal win over Boisson, she improved her win-loss record at the tournament to 26-5, meaning she's won almost 84 per cent of her matches.

Since her US Open win, Gauff has risen as high as world No.2, successfully navigated technical challenges in her game, and continued to accrue big titles, such as last year's WTA Finals shortly after she captured the 1000-level trophy in Beijing.

The longer she spends on tour, and the more experience she banks, the less of a big deal things seem – making Saturday's final easier to approach.

“I think [it's about] just realising how minuscule it is. Like everybody is dealing with way bigger things in life than losing a final,” she said.

“And also realising that… many players wanted to be in this position. I'm sure there are hundreds of players that would kill to win or lose a final, so just knowing that, making me realise how lucky and privileged I am to be in this position.

“At first I thought it would be the end of the world if I lost, and the sun still rose the next day. So knowing, regardless of the result, the sun will still rise.

“Just realising that how big the moment seems in our lives is not as big in the grand scheme of things.”

Gauff has now reached consecutive claycourt finals in Madrid, Rome and Paris, entering her clash against Sabalenka having won 16 of her past 18 matches on the surface.

One of those two losses came to Sabalenka in the Madrid final, but Gauff will fancy her chances when they meet again on Saturday.

The head-to-head series is tied at 5-5, as well as 1-1 on clay, 1-1 at Grand Slams and 1-1.

History shows she has just as good a chance of winning as her big-hitting rival.

“Obviously she's someone who has great big shots, and she's going to come out aggressive, she's going to come out swinging. I think I just have to expect that and do my best to kind of counter that,” Gauff said.

“I think the past experience that I've played her, we had some up-and-down matches, we had some that I won straight sets and her vice versa.

“Anything can happen on Saturday. But I'm looking forward to it, and glad to be going up against a World No.1, too.”

The American, regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time—with four Olympic gold medals and 23 Grand Slam singles titles—says winning the title in Melbourne while expecting her first daughter was the highlight of her career. 'I don't know how I did that.'

Serena Williams had many outstanding moments during her storied tennis career.

But the American superstar singles out winning a Grand Slam while pregnant as probably her most astonishing achievement.

“I don't know how I did that, honestly,” Williams said on Wednesday (6 June) at the SuperReturn private equity conference in Berlin, Germany.

“I don't know what I was doing then, I was nine weeks pregnant ... I do remember not being able to run for a long time.”

The four-time Olympic gold medallist, now 43, won a record 23 Grand Slam title at the 2017 Australian Open while pregnant with her first of two daughters, Olympia, at the age of 35. Even more remarkable was that she didn't drop a set on her way to winning her seventh title in Melbourne.

She beat her sister Venus in that epic final.

“I didn't tell anyone,” continued Williams, who retired from professional in 2022 after a 27-year career.

“I mean, Venus knew, and I still feel really bad about that, because a deep part of me feels like because we played each other in the final, I'm like, she must have known, and she must have felt some sort of deep heaviness to go even further and go all out. But she was only one of two people that knew.”

“I remember one time playing a long point against one player, and I couldn't breathe. And I'm like, how does she not see that I'm not able to breathe right now, and so I just intentionally lost the next point just to kind of try and get my energy back. But then I was like: Why am I playing this far pregnant? This is nuts.”

Williams was speaking in Berlin to private equity professionals as the owner of Serena Ventures, a venture capital firm she runs.

Emerson Jones hopes to become the first Australian in 27 years to advance to the Roland Garros girls' final with victory in Friday's semifinal.

Paris, France, 6 June 2025 | Jackson Mansell

History is on the line for Emerson Jones on Friday as she aims to become the first player since Maria Emilia Salerni in 2000 to reach a Grand Slam girls' singles final on every surface.

The 16-year-old seeks to pair her Australian Open 2024 and Wimbledon 2024 finals appearances with a place in Saturday's Roland Garros championship match.

First, Jones will have to get through her semifinal against Austrian Lilli Tagger, whom she defeated in the Australian Open girls' semifinal earlier this year.

READ: Jones surges into Australian Open girls' singles semifinal

The junior world No.2 seeks to join Jelena Dokic in the history books. Dokic was the last Australian to advance to a Roland Garros girls' singles final, achieving the feat in 1998.

The top-seeded Australian will enter Friday's match aiming to replicate the dominance displayed in her quarterfinal win over American Julieta Pareja.

Jones created pressure for the No.9 seed in the 7-5 6-4 victory, committing 12 fewer unforced errors and generating 10 more break point opportunities.

Victory on Friday could set up a potential Roland Garros final with doubles partner Hannah Klugman, who battles Bulgarian Rositsa Dencheva in the other semifinal.

Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff are tied at 5-5, and now everything's on the line -- a blockbuster No. 1 vs. No. 2 showdown for the French Open crown, the first of its kind in more than a decade.

It all comes down to this: At the end of a mesmerizing spring swing, it's No. 1 vs. No. 2 for the clay-court Grand Slam title at Roland Garros.

Either top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka or World No. 2 Coco Gauff will capture their first French Open singles title. The winner will break the three-year stranglehold on the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen by Iga Swiatek, who fell to Sabalenka in Thursday's semifinals.

Roland Garros: Draws | Scores

Sabalenka comes in as the season's top player. By ousting Swiatek, she became the first player to post 40 main-draw match-wins at the tour level in 2025. She has already won three titles and reached three other finals this year.

Gauff has been a fixture at every major stop on clay this spring. Before Roland Garros, she reached the final at both WTA 1000 events -- the Mutua Madrid Open and the Internazionali BNL d'Italia.

Here's what you need to know about Saturday's marquee showdown, which will determine who joins Australian Open champion Madison Keys as this year's Grand Slam winners:

The Roland Garros women's singles final will take place on Saturday, June 7 on Court Philippe-Chatrier, currently scheduled for 3 p.m. Paris time (9 a.m. ET).

The doubles final will take place the following day, Sunday, June 8, currently scheduled for 11 a.m. Paris time (5 a.m. ET).

Grand Slam tournaments offer the most ranking points on tour, and by reaching the final, both Sabalenka and Gauff have secured 1,300 points. Those points will count toward both their PIF WTA Rankings and the Race to the WTA Finals Riyadh. The winner will see that total rise to 2,000.

Win or lose, Sabalenka will remain at No. 1 in the rankings and the Race. Gauff is projected to rise from No. 5 to No. 2 in the Race, and she will maintain her No. 2 spot in the rankings.

The prize money pool in Paris is also one of the highest totals on the calendar. The singles runner-up will earn €1,275,000, and the champion will receive €2,550,000.

Sabalenka eased into the semifinals without the loss of a set, including a Top 10 win over Zheng Qinwen in the quarterfinals. Naturally, things got more complex when she faced four-time champion Swiatek in the final four.

Swiatek pushed Sabalenka to three sets for the first time all fortnight, but Sabalenka dominated the third set to post a 7-6(1), 4-6, 6-0 victory and snap Swiatek's 26-match winning streak at the tournament.

Sabalenka is now the first woman to reach the singles final in three consecutive Grand Slam events (2024 US Open, 2025 Australian Open and French Open) since Serena Williams (Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon, all in 2016).

Sabalenka's run to the final:1R: d. Kamilla Rakhimova 6-1, 6-02R: d. Jil Teichmann 6-3, 6-13R: d. Olga Danilovic 6-2, 6-34R: d. [16] Amanda Anisimova 7-5, 6-3QF: d. [8] Zheng Qinwen 7-6(3), 6-3SF: d. [5] Iga Swiatek 7-6(1), 4-6, 6-0

Gauff has also dropped only one set so far, when she ended her fellow American Keys' bid for the Calendar Slam in the quarterfinals.

Gauff then emphatically put an end to the fairytale run by French wild card Lois Boisson, who captured the hearts of her home country ranked No. 361.

Since the Mutua Madrid Open's inception in 2009, Gauff, 21, is the youngest player to reach the finals at WTA 1000 Madrid, WTA 1000 Rome and Roland Garros in a single calendar year.

Gauff's run to the final:1R: d. Olivia Gadecki 6-2, 6-22R: d. [Q] Tereza Valentova 6-2, 6-43R: d. Marie Bouzkova 6-1, 7-6(3)4R: d. [20] Ekaterina Alexandrova 6-0, 7-5QF: d. [7] Madison Keys 6-7(6), 6-4, 6-1SF: d. [WC] Lois Boisson 6-1, 6-2

A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros)

Evenly! Their overall head-to-head is deadlocked at 5-5. They are 1-1 at Grand Slam events, and 1-1 on clay.

At the Grand Slams, Gauff beat Sabalenka from a set down in the 2023 US Open final. Sabalenka got her revenge at the very next Slam, with a straight-sets win in the 2024 Australian Open semifinals.

On clay, Gauff beat Sabalenka in straight sets in the Round of 16 at 2021 Rome. But just last month, Sabalenka leveled all the numbers by beating Gauff in the 2025 Mutua Madrid Open final.

This is the first No. 1 versus No. 2 Roland Garros final since 2013, when No. 1 seed Serena Williams defeated No. 2 Maria Sharapova.

Sabalenka is chasing her fourth Grand Slam singles title -- and her first away from her favored hard courts, where she's won the 2023 and 2024 Australian Opens and the 2024 US Open.

One more win would make Sabalenka the only currently active player to have won singles titles at three of the four Grand Slam events.

Gauff is aiming for her second Grand Slam singles title. She toppled Sabalenka to clinch her first at the 2023 US Open. But this is Gauff's second Roland Garros singles final -- she finished runner-up to Swiatek at Paris in 2022.

A Gauff victory would make her the youngest American to win the Roland Garros singles title since Serena Williams in 2002.

1 - The World No. 1 and 2 will face each other in a Women's Singles Grand Slam final for the 1st time since the Australian Open 2018 (Halep & Wozniacki) and for the first time at Roland Garros since 2013 (S Williams & Sharapova).

Here's some of what Sabalenka and Gauff said to the press after their semifinal wins:

Sabalenka: ""[The semifinal] was a big match, and it felt like a final, but I know that the job is not done yet. And I have to go out there on Saturday, and I have to fight and I have to bring my best tennis, and I have to work for that title, especially if it's going to be Coco. 

""Almost like [my] whole life, I've been told [clay] is not my thing, and then I didn't have any confidence. And in the past I don't know how many years, we've been able to develop my game so much, so I feel really comfortable on this surface and actually enjoy playing on clay. If I'll be able to get this trophy, it's just going to mean the world for us.""

Gauff: ""My first final here I was super nervous, and I kind of wrote myself off before the match even happened. Obviously here, I have a lot more confidence just from playing a Grand Slam final before and doing well in one. I think going into Saturday I'll just give it my best shot and try to be as calm and relaxed as possible. Whatever happens, happens, and knowing that I put the best effort forward.

As the other Grand Slams embrace automation, the French Open remains rooted in a more tactile, time-honored version of the game.

In the third set of her fourth-round match, serving at 4-4, Elena Rybakina faced a break point. When her second serve was called out, Iga Swiatek began the walk to her changeover chair, thinking she'd be serving for the match.

But chair umpire Kader Nouni, unsure of the line judge's call, scrambled down from his seat and scrutinized the mark. He (correctly, as it turned out) determined that the ball had clipped the service line and Rybakina was awarded a first serve -- and rallied from 15-40 down to take the lead Swiatek thought was hers.

“I wasn't overthinking it,” Swiatek said later. “When I came close, yeah, the ball seemed like it touched the line. Elena, I don't think she asked for the umpire's opinion, but he obviously needs to check if he has doubts.

“So for sure I felt like it's over a little bit, but on the other hand, I just refocused immediately. It wasn't such a big deal for me. It was more just a situation, and it passed, and I was ready for another ball anyway.”

Swiatek won 12 of the last 15 points to advance to the quarterfinals at Roland Garros, keeping alive her quest for a fourth consecutive title. But the “situation” focused attention on The French Tennis Federation's resistance to electronic line calling (ELC) and the decision to employ conventional line judges.

The Australian Open turned to ELC in 2021 and the US Open followed a year later. With Wimbledon, the epitome of tennis history, set to pivot to ELC later this month, the French Open is the last Grand Slam holdout. The new technology is now required at all ATP Tour events, including clay, the only surface where the ball always leaves a visible mark.

“For Roland Garros, we want to keep our linesmen as long as the players agree with that,” said FFT President Gilles Moretton.

But how long will that be? The majority of the players, despite occasional, high-profile, in-match objections, seem to side with technology.

“I don't know if it's like Gen Z in me, but I think if we have the technology we should use it,” Coco Gauff said. “Obviously umpires are great. These small details in the match can matter in the grand scheme of things.

“But I respect the tournament's decision, and I respect the fact that they still have line umpires. I'm not going to be out here advocating and pushing for it. But yeah, if I had a preference I would choose to play on the court maybe where the robots are making the decisions.”





 Getty Images
                        

But, of course, there are misgivings, too. Resisting technology -- embracing the status quo -- is a natural impulse. It's what we're used to. It's why people of a certain age prefer newspapers to reading online, or old-fashioned CDs (in extreme cases, even vinyl records) to streaming music.

ELC, in theory, allows for the depth of the layer of clay on the court and the speed and trajectory of the ball on impact. Still, there are questions.

Back in April, World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka fought technology … with technology.

It was 3-3 against Elise Mertens at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, when her volley was called out by ELC, giving the game to Mertens. Sabalenka objected, prompting chair umpire Miriam Bley to inspect the mark. She confirmed the call, but during the changeover, Sabalenka grabbed a phone supplied by her team, walked over to the mark and snapped a photo.

The crowd was divided between whistles and cheers, but Bley hit Sabalenka with a code violation for unsportsmanlike conduct.

Later, after winning nine of the last 10 games, Sabalenka insisted the ball was in.

“We all making mistakes, and it's OK,” Sabalenka explained later. “Right now I prefer the Hawk-Eye system. I trust it more with most of the referees.”





 Getty Images
                        

At the Mutua Madrid Open, Alexander Zverev made headlines by taking a photo of a mark from Alejandro Davidovich Fokina that ELC called in, but he thought was out.

There was another collision between man and machine in the fourth round when Zheng Qinwen, serving at 4-2 in the third set, hit an apparent ace to get to deuce with Liudmila Samsonova. There was no objection from ELC, but chair umpire Pierre Bacchi studied the mark before calling it out. The double fault gave Samsonova the game and, temporarily, the match was back on serve.

Mirra Andreeva was serving for the match in her Round of 16 match against Yuliia Starodubtseva when a massive power outage shook Madrid. The chair umpire agreed to call the lines and Andreeva dug out of a 15-40 hole to win the match.

While Andreeva appreciated the intervention, she prefers electronic line calling.

“It's kind of what the system says, you just go with it, and you cannot really argue with that,” Andreeva said. “It's just easier for me to not to pay attention if the call is right or wrong.”

Madison Keys, the Australian Open champion, has mixed feelings.

“I think it's great in some ways because it takes kind of the arguing out of it,” she said. “I also know that electronic line calling has a margin for error. I think it gets a little bit tricky when you're staring at a mark that's clearly out, but the board is saying that it's touching. 

“I don't know where I stand on it quite yet.”

With only a few matches left at Roland Garros, we might well be seeing the end of an era.

“I don't know,” Sabalenka said. “I had situation with the referee in Stuttgart, and also there was tricky calls with the Hawk-Eye system in Rome. I guess there is some, like, old school why having the referees and calling the referee to check the mark. I think that's something which brings like in old days, which is cool, probably.

“Honestly, I'm really confused with my opinion.”

Carlos Alcaraz is back into the final at Roland Garros after Lorenzo Musetti was forced to retire from their semifinal match in the fourth set due to a leg injury.After dropping his fourth set of the tournament, Alcaraz was leading Musetti 4-6, 7-6(3), 6-0, 2-0 when the Italian ultimately could not continue after two hours, 25 minutes. A short while earlier, trailing 0-5 in the third set, Musetti called for the physio to receive treatment on his upper left leg, having first reached for it after landing awk""It's never great to get through or win the match like this,"" Alcaraz said afterwards. ""Lorenzo is a great player; he has done an incredible clay season, he's one of the few players who achieved at least the semifinals in all the big events on clay. ... That shows what an incredible player he is. I just wish him all the best, soon recovery, and I'm sure we're going to enjoy his tennis again pretty soon.""Musetti is the third man in the Open Era who has retired from a Roland Garros semifinal, following David Nalbandian in 2006 against Roger Federer and Alexander Zverev against Rafael Nadal in 2022.

Before Musetti's injury, Alcaraz said he was able to swing freer after capturing a see-saw second in which the players traded breaks twice. Alcaraz was the one ahead, first at 2-1 and again at 6-5, but found his best level in the tiebreak. He led 6-1 before converting on his fourth set point a while later.""The first two sets were really tough. I had chances to break his serve, to be up in the match, and I couldn't make the most of it,"" Alcaraz said. ""He was playing great tennis. When I won the second set, it was a little bit of relief, and in the third set I knew what I had to do in the beginning: pushing him to the limit, trying to be aggressive and not let him dominate the game, and just be myself.""I was more calm, I could see things more clear, and I could play great tennis at the beginning of the third set.""

Last June as a 15-year-old wild card, Hannah Klugman made it to the final round of Wimbledon qualifying on a surface British players traditionally prefer.Nearly twelve months later, Klugman has posted her best junior singles result across the English Channel on red clay. Seeded No. 8 in the Roland Garros girls' event, the now 16-year-old finds herself two wins away from lifting the trophy.“Everyone says the Brits don't like the clay. But I actually really like it!” Klugman told Prakash Amritraj on Tennis Channel.“I think it really suits my game. Me and my coach this year, we said let's do a long bloc on clay. We've done two months and I'm really loving it. I'm not ready to get off yet and go to grass.”

As Klugman navigates the external noise that comes with an upward trajectory in the sport, a compatriot of note is ready to guide her through it all. Earlier this year, world No. 5 Jack Draper had lunch with his fellow Londoner and encouraged Klugman to reach out when she needs a hand.“We go through a lot of mentally tough times. Last year, I kind of struggled a bit. He spoke to me a lot,” Klugman shared. “He had a time when he also struggled.“He really helped me and he's been someone who's always there. He said to me, ‘whenever you need help, I'm here for you.' That was really nice.”

That was really nice.”

“He really helped me and he's been someone who's always there. He said to me, ‘whenever you need help, I'm here for you.' That was really nice.”

Klugman isn't running away from the spotlight, either. The energetic teen, now in online schooling, keeps “normal” by staying close to her friends. Top 25-ranked juniors Mika Stojsavljevic (No. 6) and Mingge “Mimi” Xu (No. 24) provide plenty of local competition to ensure no one feels alone in the path being taken.“I think it's pretty cool. I love it. I'm still young, I'm enjoying it. It's a long journey, I've realized,” said Klugman, who has also contested a pair of junior Grand Slam doubles finals. “I just take it in my stride and I'm excited. We've got an amazing bunch of juniors right now. We definitely push each other to be better.”A stretch of play on home soil awaits after Paris, with her backyard tournament waiting in the wings. A good time with her friends and another chat with Draper just may be on the calendar of events, too.

Q. I wanted to ask about the escape rooms that you mentioned. Who do you do those with? What were the themes? How did they go? Did you escape?COCO GAUFF: We're 1 for 1. I did one like a week ago. We got out of that one. Then the most recent one we did, we did not get out. We had one more clue left.Yeah, it was not my fault. My dad and I were the best. My mom and I did it with Chris Eubanks, and them two were the worst. I know when I invite my mom, she's not going to be great. She's just there for the vibes.But Chris I expected a little bit better to be, just considering he claims he's good at escape rooms. But, yeah, they're fun. I think I'm pretty good, but the first one I did last week, my team carried. I wasn't that good.Q. What were the themes?COCO GAUFF: The first week we had to find the doctor that was experimenting on humans and prove it. Then the next one, some subway was blowing up, and we had to fix it, and I didn't know how to read a subway map (laughing).That's why. The clue was, like, Read the map, it's going north and switch to change, and I had no idea what that meant because I don't really ride the metro that much, and I never rode it in Paris.

James Vowles and Andy Cowell have given an insight into how much they learned from Toto Wolff about being a team principal, with the pair having both worked extensively alongside the Austrian at Mercedes before taking on their respective roles at Williams and Aston Martin.

Prior to becoming the new team boss at Williams in 2023, Vowles acted as Motorsport Strategy Director at the Silver Arrows and in the years before held key engineering and strategy roles at Mercedes, Brawn GP, Honda and BAR.

Pushed during the Monaco Grand Prix weekend on how much of Wolff's leadership approach informed his own style, Vowles – seated alongside Wolff in the press conference – responded: “Toto just joked, 'all of it', but it's not a joke. It really is that.

“I had the pleasure of being… Toto, probably 10 years ago, 12 years ago or so, he pulled me under his wing and just slowly allowed me to get more and more responsibility within the organisation in a way that exposed me to the difficulties that he's going through daily, but in a safe and positive way.

Vowles has praised Wolff for his ""expertise and guidance""

“So it went similar to drivers – drivers into more technical bits of the business. And there's no doubt about it, I would have sunk without his expertise and guidance by my side, and it's what he does really well, but he's bashful and doesn't talk about it too much.

“But it was a pleasure in that circumstance. There was a time that's not very well known, but we spent a week together in his place in Austria and that was one of the best weeks of my life. So, there are some incredible things that you can do whilst you're under the guidance of Toto.”

Cowell echoed those comments as he looked back on his own time at Mercedes, having acted as Engineering Director for the Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines division from 2008 to 2013 before taking on the position of Managing Director of the renamed Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains.

The Briton left the company in 2020 and made a return to the grid as CEO of Aston Martin in late 2024, while he also became Team Principal ahead of the 2025 campaign.

“I think [in] my time at Mercedes, I learned from Toto,” Cowell explained. “I learned from Niki Lauda. I learned from Ola Källenius, and there are all these characters that you come across when you're in the Mercedes family. And yeah, you try and remember the good bits and push and move forwards.”

Cowell spent several years working alongside Wolff at Mercedes

Wolff also took a moment to look back on the qualities he saw in Cowell and Vowles whilst working with them at Mercedes, with the team boss suggesting that both showed signs of being able to lead a team in the future.

“With Andy, he was one of the strongest managers that I've seen ever in my life with all the other businesses,” Wolff reflected. “He had also the human side and the people management, on the other side, the technical skill.

“We used to laugh when we had an engine issue, that Andy was having his fingers on the pistons and in the cylinder head on the Saturday, after Qualifying. And I always said, ‘Are your nails dirty?' Because that meant he was in control of what was happening on the engine side. So, yeah, definitely.

“And James, you know, James could have been a team principal in Mercedes if it wasn't [for] me. I was in his way. So, he chose another route, and does that very well as you can see.”

	Ahead of Father's Day, Dwayne Johnson reveals how he continues to honor his influential late grandfather through his men's grooming brand, Papatui, and his film roles.


	In a new Instagram post, the Jungle Cruise star and girl dad shared how his Samoan grandfather, High Chief Peter Maivia, “epitomized true masculinity and ‘self care' before self care became a popular term,” he wrote. “[He] was a big influence on me, respected everywhere he went and knew how to take care of himself, and he was also the inspiration behind my character Maui from Moana,” Johnson explains in the video, which also coincides with Papatui's debut in Walmart stores and online. The brand is also available at Target.

	The superstar entrepreneur has previously spoken about how his affordable body care company's name comes from “little tui,” the nickname given to him by his grandfather; and “papa,” which also means “rock” in Samoan and references his favorite role as a father.

A post shared by Dwayne Johnson (@therock)


	The 53-year-old father of three continued, “We all have fathers, grandfathers, father figures in our lives who could use a little self care, which is why this Father's Day, I recommend you get them Papatui men's care essentials from Walmart. Unleash your inner Papatui — I have no idea what that means but it sounds cool!”


	Launched last year, Papatui spans skin care; body washes, soaps and lotions; aluminum-free deodorants and antiperspirants; hair care; tattoo care and more grooming products, all under $13. The formulas are all vegan, cruelty-free and formulated without phthalates, parabens and sulfates, while the brand's hero fragrances were developed by Frank Voelkl, who created Le Labo's best-selling Santal 33. Voelkl is behind signature scents such as Sandalwood Suede, Papatui's warm and woody “proprietary five-star resort and spa” fragrance; Lush Coconut with notes of vanilla that smells like “a luxury island escape”; and Cedar Sport, a fresh cedarwood aroma that “gives a hit of ‘conquer the day' energy in the mornings.” (The brand also offers Vanilla Shea and unscented options.)

The woman going by Jane Doe from the witness stand at the rap mogul's trial detailed a romantic courtship that devolved quickly into drug-fueled sex marathons with other men. 


							By 

	Kevin Dolak



	A woman federal prosecutors are calling a victim of Sean “Diddy” Combs took the stand at his federal trial in lower Manhattan on Thursday, telling the court that during their three year relationship, which lasted up until his September arrest, 90 percent of their time together was during drug-fueled, days-long “freak-offs” where she was coerced into performing sex acts with male sex workers.


	The woman, who is being referred to as Jane Doe during the trial to protect her identity, is the latest woman brought forth by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York to explain how the feds say the once powerful rap and fashion mogul used his companies and loyal staff as a criminal enterprise to coerce and control women, whom he would blackmail and manipulate into performing in “freak-off” sex marathons, which the near-billionaire would often film while masturbating. Combs has pled not guilty to all charges in the feds' five-count indictment, which includes sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution.

	Taking the stand after court had returned from the day's lunch break, Jane Doe revealed early in her testimony that prior to connecting romantically with Combs in 2021, she was involved with a man with whom Combs has history and a tense relationship. She said she met the rap world icon in Miami at a party she attended with a group of girlfriends, one of whom was casually dating Combs at the time, since his 2018 split with R&B singer Cassie Ventura, the federal prosecutors' star witness. Combs has been involved with several women at once, a fact that Doe told the jury was known to her as the relationship's inception.

	Over her first few hours of testimony Thursday afternoon, Doe painted a picture of the couple's meet-cute and easy segue into a more serious relationship, which grew over phone calls, texts and FaceTime video calls. In fact, their relationship saw a boom when Doe's friend, who was dating Combs, got engaged and moved to Europe. Soon, she told the court, Combs swept her off her feet with a trip to Turks and Caicos and the Bahamas over 15 days. The two enjoyed the relaxing island and dinner on their hotel suite's balcony, where they enjoyed viewing sunsets together. She recalled how he even bought her a bracelet that spells out L-O-V-E. Their sex life was the two of them; she was smitten. 


	“I really fell head over heels for Sean,” she said, adding that it was OK for her that he was also seeing other people because she really liked him. “I understood that on his end, it was never a monogamous relationship. 


	One small hiccup on the trip, she recalled, came when Doe was handed an ecstasy pill by Combs and ended up so gobsmacked by the mind-bending drug that she doubled over in the sand and had to be taken into a tepid shower; over the remainder of the 15-day trip, Doe said she took Ecstacy 10 more times in smaller increments that were pieced out by Combs. 


	The questioning prosecuting attorney on Thursday quickly moved on to the moment that the relationship soured for Doe, when she asked her to recall for the court the night of March 21, 2021, when she was asked to participate in her first “freak-off” with Combs, which were also referred to as “hotel nights” at times. After Combs' assistants had set up the hotel suite, Doe said, she would dress in racy lingerie and high-heeled shoes. That was when Combs told her someone was coming: a male escort named Don, whom Combs said he knew. The encounter as described by Doe followed a familiar trajectory, one described by Ventura a few weeks ago when she testified about her “freak-off” experiences: the woman and escort would pour baby oil onto each other's bodies (12 bottles one time, she said); the two begin touching; Doe begins to perform oral sex on Don as Combs watches, masturbating. From the witness stand, Doe said that it was she who “tried to move things along” into the suite's bedroom. Combs protested when Doe asked to use a condom, she explained to the court, but he soon provided one and Don and Doe began to have sex. 

	











	Doe said that her initial experience performing a “freak-off” hotel night with Combs made her “happy” and that “it was taboo.”


	“I just thought that it was a night of fun; I didn't think that we'd be doing it again,” she told the court, at that point holding back tears. “I think that night opened a Pandora's Box in our relationship and I was never able to shut it. It just completely set the tone for our relationship moving forward.”


	When asked to give a percentage figure by federal prosecutors, Doe told the court that after May 2021, 90 percent of the sexual experiences she had with Combs involved other men. The rapper, Doe told the court, suggested they have a hotel night the very next time the two saw each other. 


	“I just wanted to satisfy my partner,” she said of participating in the freak-offs. 


	As their relationship stretched into months, Combs began to give large sums of money to Doe, whose work marketing brands on her social media accounts was dwindling. He handed her $10,000 after their initial trip to Turks and Caicos as she'd missed out on some work while on the trip with him; later, he'd typically give her $5,000 or $6,000 incrementally. As was the case with Ventura, he began to pay for her apartment; Doe said this was a reason she felt compelled to participate in “freak-offs” even when she started to not enjoy them.


	“I felt obligated to perform because my partner was paying my rent,” she explained. 

	











	An attempt she had planned to earn her own money by launching an Only Fans account, where she would appear in lingerie and bikinis, could have helped out with a sense of independence — as she told Combs, a friend had claimed she'd brought in $4 million in a year doing a Just Fans page. But Combs, she testified, was having none of that, telling her, “Let's just give it time.” Prosecutors believe this constitutes coercion to keep Doe financially dependent on him so he could control her and force her into his sexual fantasies. 


	At a point, Doe says, she asked Combs if they could stop doing “freak-offs” altogether. His response, she told the court, was to threaten her livelihood and home. 


	“He would just say things like, ‘If you want to break up, that's fine. You have three months left on the house because I'm not about to be paying rent,'” Jane recalled Combs saying.


	Doe's testimony will continue Friday as the prosecution begins to eye the resting of its case.

""I said I love them dangerous,"" the vocalist croons on the track.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Mariah Carey isn't playing it safe on new single “Type Dangerous,” which ushered in a new musical era for the vocalist Thursday (June 5).


	Featuring the superstar singing over a swaggering, percussion-heavy beat, the track showcases Mimi channeling her sultriest, most confident self. “Looking for the dangerous type,” she croons. “I like them dangerous/ That's my type/ I said I love them dangerous.”


	The track arrives after several days of teasing on Carey's social media accounts, with the icon first getting her Lambs hyped by sharing a video of herself in a luxury car, listening to a mysterious track titled “T:D_MC16.mp3.” In that same clip, the camera panned down to show that the vehicle's license plate displayed the characters, “MC16” — leading fans to conclude that the Songbird Supreme also has a new album on the way. 

	











	“Type Dangerous” serves as Carey's first proper single in years, with the five-time Grammy winner last dropping an album, Caution, in 2018. The project — which marked the 15th album in her discography — reached No. 5 on the Billboard 200. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Carey has since busied herself with her annual “All I Want for Christmas Is You” promotional cycles, as well as celebrating the anniversaries of her most iconic albums. Most recently, she commemorated The Emancipation of Mimi turning 20 years old by dropping an expansive two-disc set compiling numerous remixes, bonus tracks, radio mixes and a cappella cuts. (Billboard also celebrated the milestone by ranking all 18 of the album's original tracks.)

The Academy of Country Music held a round of layoffs on Thursday (June 5), with approximately one-quarter of the staff impacted, Billboard has learned.


	“Coming off a successful 60th ACM Awards week and renewal with Prime Video through 2028, the Academy implemented a strategic staff realignment in an effort to support its future business and growth initiatives, resulting in the elimination of five staff positions across various departments including communications, marketing, events and community relations,” the ACM told Billboard in a statement. “We thank these individuals for their dedication and contributions to the work of the Academy.”

Bingham served as an intern at the ACM before joining the staff full-time in 2021. Cothran joined the ACM in 2024, and previously worked for PR companies including Shore Fire Media and Sweet Talk PR. Prior to joining the ACM, Uhniat served as creative coordinator at Resin8 Music.


	Nearly a month ago, on May 8, the Academy of Country Music celebrated the milestone 60th annual ACM Awards, which aired on Prime Video from the Ford Center at the Star in Frisco, Texas. Ella Langley, Lainey Wilson and Alan Jackson were among the night's biggest winners, with Wilson taking home her second ACM entertainer of the year trophy. Meanwhile, Langley won five trophies and Jackson was feted with the inaugural ACM lifetime achievement award. The 60th anniversary ACM Awards was hosted by Reba McEntire.


	Meanwhile, the ACM also recently announced that the organization and ACM Awards producer Dick Clark Productions (DCP) had cemented a deal with Prime Video for the ACM Awards to continue on Prime Video for the next three years, running through the 63rd annual ACM Awards ceremony in 2028.

After getting serious on Sincere, Khalid is ready to have fun again.


													By
												

	Richard Trapunski



TikTok is a time machine. Hearing his songs on the app, Khalid finds himself in an earlier era.  


	Last February, the Billboard Hot 100-topping R&B and pop artist noticed one of his early hits was resurfacing. “Location” — which peaked at No. 16 in 2017 — was connecting with listeners all over again, who were singing along to the yearning lyrics about love in the digital age with a fresh perspective.  


	“It's a whole new society, a whole new age of young adults who are experiencing this song,” Khalid says. “I lived it, and I performed it, but to see people who are now the age I was then listening to that song, it's surreal, funny and nostalgic. It makes me live vicariously through that experience. I'm like, wow, there's a reason why it resonates with them: because that was real.” 


	When he first wrote the song, Khalid was a teenager himself. A 17-year-old living in El Paso, Texas, he uploaded the track to SoundCloud without ever considering the impact the now-diamond-certified song might one day have on young lovelorn listeners a decade later.  

	











	“Turning 27 this year came with a lot of reflection on life,” he says. “I started to look back at where I was when I was 17. To be able to be in my career for as long as I have, to still have an impact, even to see things going viral on TikTok — I feel like that version of me 10 years ago would be so proud and so happy. And if you had told him all of [what would happen in the next 10 years]?” he says with a chuckle. “He wouldn't have had a clue.” 

	











	Now fully cemented as an in-demand collaborator, global arena artist and reliably charting hit-maker, Khalid is ready to rediscover the innocent version of himself that he was before he found success.  


	He wants to be the most open and honest version of himself — not necessarily the serious and emotional version  Khalid spent years of his life pouring into 2024's Sincere, but one that is able to relax because he has fully embraced his own identity.  


	“Not just my moody side, but the fun side,” he says. “The flirty side.” 


Though Sincere was a deeply personal album, there was one part of himself Khalid hadn't quite revealed yet.  


	In November 2024, Khalid was outed by an ex-boyfriend. Though it's not how he wanted to share that part of his identity with his fans, with a simple rainbow emoji he confirmed that he is gay and “not ashamed of [his] sexuality.'” 


	He was never hiding anything, he says, just protecting that part of his privacy. Stepping back onstage and seeing the reaction from his fans reaffirmed his open and honest approach to music. 


	“I had a moment where I walked out and I looked into the crowd, and I'm singing these songs that — I was obviously gay when I wrote them, but the world may not have known,” he recounts. “Everybody is singing them the same way they were before I was outed! So [that shows me] none of my fans care about my sexual preferences. I think they care about our mutual respect for music.” 


	He realized he didn't have to keep finding ways to protect his privacy. It was a liberating experience, he says, seeing that very little had changed.  


	“Finding that freedom comes from knowing I can just be myself and still be embraced and appreciated,” he says. “That doesn't change because the world finds out I'm gay. Because I don't change because the world finds out I'm gay.” 

	











	Though artists express themselves through their music, the songs live their own lives. Once they're out in the world, fans can project their own feelings and experiences onto them. In some ways, the music belongs to the listener as much as the artist.


	After he came out, a fan pointed out that his 2022 song “Satellite” was already “an LGBTQ anthem.” In addition, “Better” has been used as a first dance at multiple weddings, and the 2017 song “Young Dumb & Broke” has become a staple at graduations. As listeners find meaning in the music, it takes on its own dimensions.  


	“When you're an artist, you carry a responsibility,” Khalid says. “People will live to your music, people will die to your music, people will give birth, people will be reborn. There's so much emotion involved in the exchange of music from artists to listeners.” 


	He uses “Young Dumb & Broke” as an example. The song's universal experience of the feeling of invincibility of life in your teenage years has persisted from one generation to the next, which is something he would not have predicted.  


	“ ‘Young Dumb & Broke' lasting as long as it has now would have never been anything I imagined, because when I made that song, I was so presently focused on being young, dumb and broke,” he says. “When I was singing that song at 19, I probably would have told you that I couldn't wait to stop singing that song. Now, I love it.” 


	Khalid says he wants to inspire young Black men to be comfortable being open about their sexuality, but he doesn't see the music as appealing to any specific kind of listener because of the identity of the person making it.  


	“Music is subjective,” he says. “If you place yourself in an experience, we can relate to people all across the board. It doesn't matter if you're gay, it doesn't matter if you're straight. We all have feelings and we all have emotions.” 

	











Khalid is a major star of the streaming era. He has multiple songs in Spotify's Billions Club (tracks with 1 billion streams), including “Location,” “Young Dumb & Broke” and “Lovely,” his collaboration with Billie Eilish. At his 2019 streaming peak, he spent some time as the most popular artist on the platform. 


	When he first started, though, those platforms were barely on his radar. Instead, he uploaded his first songs to SoundCloud, the streaming site where users once shared their own music and mixtapes — a popular platform for new musicians. There was very little thought to strategy or rollout.  


	“Naturally, that led to other apps like YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music and so on. But that's where it all started,” he recalls. “I remember being on the phone with a friend, like, ‘I'm about to upload my song to the internet.' It felt so carefree back then — just making songs with my friends and throwing them online. Nobody could have imagined what streaming would become today.” 


	Though he couldn't have predicted it, Khalid was uniquely positioned for the streaming era. He's often categorized as an R&B singer, but he has a genre fluidity that has landed him on a diverse number of Billboard charts: Adult Contemporary, Latin, Rock & Alternative, Rap, Dance. He has a song for every playlist.  


	As a child, Khalid's parents were in the Army and he often found himself moving around. He spent six years living in Germany when he was young, then spent some of his formative teen years from eighth grade until just before his senior year in upstate New York, just 20 minutes from the Canadian border.


	“Being a military kid, I was like a sponge, just soaking in all the cultures around me,” he recounts. “When I was in northern New York, I got introduced to American folk music, which became a big part of my foundation as an artist and really shaped my songwriting. Then living in Germany exposed me to pop music from a different perspective. And coming from the South, R&B is definitely at my core. So all these different shades of music come together to make who I am.” 


	He'd moved to El Paso by the time he released his breakout 2017 debut album, American Teen, but it was inspired by his experiences growing up both there and at Fort Drum, just outside of Watertown, N.Y. Like so many other teenagers growing up outside of a major city, he spent a lot of time bored or partying — and dabbling in music.   

	











	“A lot of the stories that ended up inspiring American Teen came from that time in my life,” he recalls. “It was cold and kind of bleak, with not a whole lot to do — but there were definitely a lot of parties. At the time, it was fun and wild. Looking back now as an adult, I'm like, ‘Why did you get yourself into some of those situations?' But honestly, it was the perfect setting for teenage angst — just growing up, facing challenges and mentally taking notes.” 


	His mother was restationed to El Paso before his senior year of high school, and he decided to go with her. Lonely and separated from his friends, he began writing songs and uploading them online. At the time, Right Hand Co.'s Courtney Stewart was managing a number of producers when he was introduced to Khalid through mutual friends on Twitter and heard some of his SoundCloud demos. 


	“He didn't know it at the time, but he was writing a generational album in American Teen,” Stewart says. “As soon as I heard that voice and those lyrics, I was like, ‘This is incredible.' It was something I had never heard before. His tone, the youthfulness of the lyrics and just how it made me feel. So I got on a plane and went and met with him.” (Khalid's management team now includes Stewart, Mame Diagne, Jordan Holly and Relvyn Lopez at Right Hand.) 


	Other artists and producers have heard the same thing in his music. His ability to adapt to different sounds and his breadth of universal experiences has made him an ideal collaborator for everyone from J Balvin to Marshmello to Logic to Halsey.  

	











	Growing up near the Canadian border may also have endeared him to artists from the country. He's collaborated with a number of Canadian artists, including Majid Jordan, Tate McRae, Shawn Mendes, Alessia Cara and Justin Bieber. He's also made a big impact in the country, with 40 songs charting on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100.  


	Khalid says he loves collaborating, which brings the best attributes of two sounds together. Having another voice in the room can also let him get out of his own head, he says, and recognize when a song is a hit.  


	Most importantly, he's sure enough in his own voice that no matter the genre he's working in or the artist he's performing with, he's still recognizably Khalid.  


	“I think not losing sight and just trusting my voice has led me to be in any sound comfortably because I get to pull up as myself,” he says. “When you feel yourself on a track, you can't fake it. It's real.”


Being rather private, Khalid worries he's created an impression of himself as an introverted person. Now, he's ready to bust that myth. 

	











	“I'm actually extremely extroverted,” he says. “I love to socialize, I love to hang out, I love to see new things and meet new people. I mean, my [2019] album was called Free Spirit, but I really do believe I am one. I made that album only to go into hiding afterward. I don't feel like that's very much freedom. But now, I feel like I do have my freedom.” 


	Embracing his full self has brought him back to the carefree headspace of his SoundCloud days — but with the experience and maturity of an established music career.  


	“I started off just having fun and when I gained a career, I started to take myself a little too seriously,” he admits. “I had my fair share of time to be serious. Now I don't have a care in the world. I can just have fun.” 


	In a recently posted TikTok clip, Khalid is vibing to a snippet of an unreleased song on the streets of Manhattan. In a black hoodie and throwback raver pants and holding a black handbag, he dances along to a track that blends his signature mellow, wise-beyond-his-years vocals with a sound that evokes decadent early-2000s pop by Britney Spears or The Pussycat Dolls. Grinning ear to ear, he stops to take a quick photo with a fan. It takes only 15 seconds to see the comfort and excitement of his new chapter. 


	“My new era of music feels like I'm finally ready to be the artist I've always dreamt of being,” he says. “It goes back to the regressions of when I was a child — imagining myself and thinking, ‘I want to be this artist one day.' Now I feel like I have the confidence to finally be that artist.”

The sixth installment of Weezy's decorated series is here. 


													By
												

	Michael Saponara



Lil Wayne has turned the Earth into Planet Weezy once again. Wayne returned to deliver Tha Carter VI on Friday (June 6), which comes seven years after the fifth installment of his critically-acclaimed series.


	Weezy tackles an array of sonics and utilizes various flows across the 19-track effort, which features guest appearances from BigXthaPlug, MGK, Kodak Black, Wyclef Jean, Jelly Roll, Big Sean, Mannie Fresh, 2 Chainz, Bono, Andrea Bocelli and two of Wayne's children. 


	“Real art can't be rushed — and y'all know I ain't never been on nobody's clock but mine. Been silent but not still. To the fans who've been waiting, I love you,” Wayne said in a press release. “This album is for the ones who've been riding with me through all Tha Carters. We takin' it further than ever before with this one. Tunechi back. C6 is here. I'm just bein myself. Sorry for the wait.”


	The New Orleans rap deity will take a bow and a well-deserved victory lap on Friday night when he takes the Madison Square Garden stage for the first time as a solo headliner to debut cuts from his latest effort and reunite with those who have been on this Hall-of-Fame journey with him for nearly three decades. 


	Lil Wayne didn't give much insight into the album beforehand, as fans only got a sliver of “The Days” featuring U2's Bono, which was implemented as part of the NBA Finals coverage ahead of a wild game one between the Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder. 


	This is Wayne's first solo album since 2020's Funeral, which topped the Billboard 200. Weezy has lived on top with Tha Carter series as the last three installments have all gone No. 1.


	The NYC takeover officially kicks off Tha Carter VI Tour before taking a few weeks off and picking up again later in June for a 34-date trek across North America.


	Fans can also purchase various merchandise bundles and vinyl records on his website, while Weezy also notched chic merch collabs with Barriers and BAPE. 


Billboard ran through all 67 minutes of C6 and ranked every track from worst to best below. 


	Free of Wayne bars, “King Carter” cleanses the palette for listeners heading into Tha Carter VI. The intro features a narrator hailing Weezy's greatness like a Roman Empire ruler returning to his throne. “With metaphors sharp as a gleaming blade, he changed the game,” the narrator states while thunderous horns rain down. “Wayne stays timeless, he'll never die.” 


	Out of all the fire production at his disposal, this circus beat should've been passed on. Weezy repeatedly says Donald Trump is the red elephant of the Republican party, but it's unclear if it's a jab at the president he was photographed with and pardoned by in 2021. 


	The bell sounds and Weezy lets the chopper sing like a mini-uzi of punchlines for three minutes straight. This is a track Wayne would've absolutely ripped during the height of his mixtape era circa '07, but instead of blazing 100 mph down the freeway, the New Orleans icon keeps it cruising at 65. 


Tha Carter V saw Wayne team up with his daughter, Reginae, and C6 brings on another family affair with teenage son Kameron Carter helming chorus duties. It's catchy for a teen who raps about “zooming in a Rari through L.A.” Although he's not old enough to drive just yet, he's probably ridden in his fair share of exotic sports cars over the years. 


	Weezy has fancied himself as an alien in the past, and his spaceship takes orbit to a different planet on “Mula Komin In.” A maximalist take on SoundCloud rap, Wayne lets his son, Lil Novi, bask in the spotlight before showing him father knows best. “He take after me, I'm the big apple tree/ And you know the apple don't fall too far from it/ He only fourteen, but that's nothing but numbers,” Wayne raps while saluting his son's aspirations. 


	Nobody — and I mean nobody — saw a Jelly Roll and Big Sean union with Wayne coming. But that's what makes Wayne great — being able to sew unlikely teammates into formation. Jelly handles chorus duties, singing about the haters lying in the weeds. “Can't trust nobody,” Weezy inflects. “Where was everybody at when I was just nobody?” Big Sean closes ruminating about those he lost and the exes left behind, while calling out “new enemies” being “old friends.” It's tough to digest, but “Snakes will” live in the middle of the pack. 


	Wayne attempts to reconnect with his rock roots while his syrupy croon floats over Weezer's “Island in the Sun” beat. Parts of the track seem to work, but others just feel like Wayne's lost on the island he's rapping about. This could be the one that takes off on TikTok, though. 


	Fans got a taste of “The Days” when it was used as part of the NBA Finals promo, and it appears to be Wayne's shot at a commercial-friendly single from C6 with a lift from U2's Bono. Weezy speaks directly to America, but things are brighter. He claims to have been in Manhattan on 9/11's tragedy, whether that be physically or spiritually, who knows? At 42, Wayne doesn't take any day for granted while thinking back to the times he was locked up or lying flat on a hospital bed, not knowing what was ahead. This would've been a smash circa 2010. 


	The first signature lighter intro of the night smokes out the desolate drum kicks. Weezy picks up the pace, sliding into his slurry flow, and it gets cold, so bundle up. The faucet runs as bars pour out of Wayne and the dark days turn to starry nights.  


	Nobody was more hyped to notch a Carter VI feature than Machine Gun Kelly, who formed the unlikely trio alongside Wayne and Kodak Black on “Alone in the Studio With My Gun.” A starry beat that Juice WRLD would've ripped, a sorrowful MGK takes on the chorus while Wayne raps about having more guns on the wall than guitars and more beats in his head than his heart. Kodak squeezes into the mix and leaves listeners with more to be desired. 


	Backed by horns, Weezy leans on New Orleans' jazzy roots for “Flex Up.” He condenses his flow nose-diving into action with plenty of drug references and gaudy name-drops to perk listeners' ears up from Christina Aguilera to Slim Shady. It's a Welcome 2 Collegrove reunion with 2 Chainz joining the sugar rush, and these guys will be able to join forces with ease until their in the retirement home.


	Wayne wasn't shy about his rock star wishes when he made the rock pivot in 2010. Here, Weezy glides over soothing strings while his guitar doubles as a lover who played him and got away. It's an enjoyable listen, but the experimental attempt feels misplaced on the album. “Damn, I'd do the most for you/ I should use that bridge you sold me to get over you,” he softly speaks in a raspy flow about a former flame. A lonely Wayne playing the guitar in front of a campsite bonfire feels like the right setting for a visual. 


	The nostalgia is strong with “Banned From NO” as longtime fans will go back to Weezy blacking out on No Ceilings standout “Banned From TV” while taking a second swipe at the N.O.R.E. classic. Wayne growls about those who crossed in his hometown, and could possibly have undertones tied to his New Orleans Super Bowl snub. 


	Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli roars in the background throughout “Maria” while bringing Tha Carter VI to the opera house. Wayne grabs the baton from Wyclef Jean and locks in with a shout-out to his rap hero Missy Elliott. He focuses on more serious subject matter, touching on seeing his father abuse his mother and the self-inflicted gunshot wound that nearly took his life. Rapping-wise, this is one of Weezy's best performances on the album and a peek behind the tattoos, shades and recluse's curtain. 


	A church choir chants “Welcome to the Carter” and then fades into the background to blend seamlessly with the holy production. Weezy effortlessly bounces off the drums while interpolating Diddy bars from the 1997 classic “Victory.” Wayne lives in his own world so it's possible he's oblivious to the troubling allegations and charges surrounding Combs. 


	A gospel record with shrewd sports-themed name-drops from Metta World Peace to Sean McVay and a tribute to Lakers legend Jerry West gets the stamp of approval. 


	Wayne throws up his B's and slides on “Loki's Theme.” This was a bona fide standout from C6 with vintage Weezy threats repping his set until a stark turn into the rock lane to close it out brings the unmitigated chaos. Regardless, it's one of the memorable tunes on the album. 


	BigXthaPlug continues his winning streak going toe-to-toe with Wayne. He kicks off the groovy “Hip-Hop” with a tight verse where he's feeling like 2Pac. They even duet on the chorus, which comes very unexpected. “B—-s all over me and X like Twitter, n—a,” Wayne raps with another cheeky punchline that Wayne has made a living spewing for nearly three decades. Hopefully there's more X and Weezy collabs down the line.


	A self-expression empowerment anthem, Wayne reunites with Cash Money engine Mannie Fresh, who builds a tarmac for Tunechi to take flight with a soul sample looped around flutes. If there's one thing about Wayne, he's always going to be the fullest version of himself, and not change for anybody. “Do a song about myself featuring myself,” Wayne raps. While AI continues to pop up and cause some to take cover in music, Weezy is confident no robot can replicate his brain. “It could be AI, it still ain't him/ And if it ain't my YM, we ain't them,” he spews. Weezy's right at home on “Bein Myself.” 


	Wayne saves the best for last with “Written History” serving as a powerful outro and final chapter to close the book on C6. Kicked off by a 1974 speech from boxing legend Muhammad Ali before stepping into the ring against Sonny Liston for the second time. 


	Weezy touts his status in the rap game atop the food chain and calls out those who have attempted to mimic his style, but there's only one Tunechi. “Don't eat the fruit without acknowledging the label, n—a,” he raps.

Senior TV Writer


EXCLUSIVE: This news should help soothe General Hospital fans who are still smarting over the reveal that Jonathan Jackson is leaving Port Charles.


	Deadline has learned that Kelly Thiebaud, who played Dr. Britt Westbourne, is returning to the ABC sudser in July.


	“It is good to be home,” says Thiebaud. 


	“I am thrilled to have Kelly back on our show,” adds GH Executive Producer Frank Valentini. “We have some great twists and turns planned for her character.”

	That's the rub, though: it's not clear if she will return as Britt or a different character. The last time fans saw her as Britt, she was attacked by a serial killer and died from his poisonous hook. (Ouch). At the time of her death, Britt was also exhibiting symptoms of Huntington's disease. (Double ouch).

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Thiebaud first joined GH in 2012. She went on recurring status a few years later and has come and gone from the sudser several times. Her last appearance was in 2023, a year after she won her first Daytime Emmy for playing Britt. 


	Away from Port Charles, Thiebaud played Eva Vasquez on ABC's Station 19 for two seasons. 


	On Thursday, it was revealed that Jackson, who plays Lucky Spencer, is leaving the ABC soap. He rejoined the show last summer after a nearly 10-year hiatus.


	“We were so glad Jonathan was able to reprise the role of Lucky, even if was for a limited time,” Valentini said in a statement. “We wish him nothing but the best, and the door is always open for Jonathan to return.”

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Mubi has acquired rights to Hal & Harper, the acclaimed indie TV series from actor-filmmaker Cooper Raiff (Cha Cha Real Smooth), for streaming in the U.S. and France, on the heels of its premiere at this year's Sundance Film Festival. The eight-episode family drama, co-starring Lili Reinhart and Mark Ruffalo, will premiere exclusively on the service this fall.


	Lionsgate financed the series, handled the sale and distributes it worldwide.


	This marks another win for independently produced television at a time when the business model is still being tested. Other recent examples of indie series that have gone on to significant streaming deals include Shane Gillis' hit comedy Tires, which just returned for a second season, as well as Mark Duplass' Penelope, both of which wound up at Netflix.

	











Hal & Harper marks the latest acquisition in a notable expansion into series this year for Mubi, following recent acquisitions of Joe Wright's Mussolini: Son of the Century and Wong Kar Wai's Blossoms Shanghai, across multiple territories. Upcoming, Mubi will also be releasing David Lynch and Mark Frost's Twin Peaks (1990) and Twin Peaks: A Limited Event Series (2017) in the U.S. and other select territories starting June 13, in honor of the franchise's 35th anniversary.  




			Watch on Deadline		







	Recently screening at France's Series Mania, where Reinhart won the award for Best Actress, Hal & Harper will next make its New York premiere at the 2025 Tribeca Festival on June 8.

	











	The show centers on two codependent siblings Hal (Raiff) and Harper (Reinhart), who are facing big life changes. The pair's intimacy is built on a lifetime of inside jokes and shared pains, portrayed via flashbacks where Raiff and Reinhart play the elementary school-aged versions of themselves. As their father, Ruffalo's charm belies a chasm of guilt, which is at the root of all that Hal & Harper is trying to uncover.


	Created and directed by Raiff, the show also stars Betty Gilpin (GLOW), Havana Rose Liu (Bottoms), Addison Timlin (Start Up), and Alyah Chanelle Scott (The Sex Lives of College Girls). Thomas Hartmann served as producer, with Raiff, Clementine Quittner, Reinhart, Daniel Lewis, and Addison Timli exec producing.


	Said Raiff in a statement to Deadline, “MUBI is the perfect home for our very specific family show. They're a singular platform that understands the art they're putting out. I am in awe of what they've done recently, and am excited to be a part of the family.”


	Raiff is represented by UTA, Black Bear, and Fusion Entertainment.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


FRIDAY AM UPDATE, after exclusive: Lionsgate is reporting $3.75M for the previews to Thunder Road's John Wick spinoff Ballerina. That number is from Wednesday and Thursday shows.


	The Rotten Tomatoes audience score stands at 93%, equal to 2023's John Wick: Chapter 4‘s which is best in the Keanu Reeves franchise.


Ballerina‘s audience score also is higher than previous solo femme action movies Furiosa (88%, 2024) and Alita: Battle Angel (91%, 2019).


	Exits on PostTrak were excellent Thursday night with a 79% definite recommend. Again, that's the fans, but it speaks volumes; we've said this before, but with the Comscore/Screen Engine polling service, “definite recommend” carries more weight than the positivity score which is 87%, still very good. This should bode well for Ballerina prancing past $30M. Men showed up to the guns-blazing ballet Thursday night at 61%. Best definite recommend and positive scores came from women over 25, who showed up at 29% and gave it an 83% and 90%, respectively.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







Ballerina takes place during the events of John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum and follows orphaned Eve Macarro (Ana de Armas), who is beginning her training in the assassin traditions of the Ruska Roma. Her father died at the hands of Gabriel Bryne's The Chancellor. She's as mad as hell, and she's not going to take it anymore.


RELATED: Ana De Armas Teases ‘Deeper' With Tom Cruise & Reveals The Lessons ‘Ballerina' Has Taught Her


	Social media org RelishMix says: “Convo on Ballerina is running positive for action fans excited to see one of their favorite franchises expand in glorious fashion. The cast is the cause of a lot of the film's positive sentiments including Ana de Armas, who has gained a lot of good will in other roles, and the promise of a returning Keanu Reeves as John Wick. Some comments are, ‘I love Ana de Armas, and I'm so excited to see her doing this kind of film after No Time to Die. She was the best Bond Girl!' and ‘I didn't actually expect Keanu to show up in the movie, glad he is gonna be in it!' plus, ‘Did I spy Norman Reedus? Between Ian McShane, Keanu, and the legendary Mr. Lance Reddick‘. Many are pleased with the direction of this film and the action spotlighted in the trailer, sharing, ‘I was wondering if they were going to do a spinoff with the dancers! This looks EPIC!!!' and, ‘I really hope that this is the start of a trilogy.'”

	











	RelishMix also notes that Reedus has the most social media followers from the Ballerina cast with his activated 19.2M, and de Armas has 15M fans, while Reeves is still off the grid for his movies.


	And as we told you Thursday night, it was imminent that Disney's Lilo & Stitch would cross $300M at 4,410 theaters, the second movie to do so YTD at the domestic B.O. after Warner Bros/Legendary's A Minecraft Movie. The hybrid/live-action feature take on the 2002 Disney toon made $5M Thursday, -7% from Wednesday, for a second week of $86.1M and a running total of $303.1M. Lilo & Stitch is expected to reign again with a third weekend of $35M.


RELATED: The Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Box Office


	Rest of the top five for the week is as follows:


	2.) Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning (Par) 3,861 theaters, Thu $2.3M (-10% from Wed), Wk $38.9M (-59%), Total $134.2M/Wk 2


	3.) Karate Kid: Legends (Sony) 3,809 theaters, Thu $1.2M (-10%), Wk $26.7M, Wk 1


	4.) Final Destination Bloodlines (NL) 3,134 theaters, Thu $1.M (-11%), Wk $16.1M (-48%), Total $117M, Wk 3


	5.) Bring Her Back (A24) 2,449 theaters, Thu $675K (-12%), Wk $10.4M, Wk 1 


EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us tonight that the John Wick spinoff Ballerina is looking to do around $3.5M-$4M in previews. That's all in, including Wednesday fan screenings that started at 7 p.m. as well as Thursday showtimes that began at 6 p.m.


	The hope is that the $80M-$90M Lionsgate production gets to north of $30M, which, as we told you, is around where recent female solo action movies openings live at the box office, read Furiosa ($26.3M 3-day last year) and 2019's Alita: Battle Angel ($28.5M 3-day in 2019).


	The Len Wiseman-directed spinoff produced by Thunder Road is expected to rank second behind Disney's third weekend of Lilo & Stitch, which is looking to make around $35M; that movie crosses $300M today.


Ballerina was delayed a year to undergo additional photography.  


	Upside on Ballerina is that Thursday night fans are enjoying the Ana de Armas movie with a Keanu Reeves cameo, giving a 94% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes — as of this minute, that's higher than any John Wick RT popcorn score; John Wick: Chapter 4 received a 93% in 2023. Critically, even though Ballerina is 72% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, it's not as high as the John Wick movies, which had film review scores ranging from 86%-94% certified fresh.


Ballerina‘s all-in preview cash is on par with the Thursday preview box office of Furiosa ($3.5M) and higher than the $2.4M Tuesday night preview cash of Alita: Battle Angel. Essentially, the thinking is to comp Ballerina to female solo action movies instead of John Wick movies. Female solo action movies are a completely different subgenre and don't always attract the full-on male audience that typically attends an action movie with a male leading star.


	Still, Ballerina‘s combined preview cash is higher than the Thursday night of 2017's John Wick 2 ($2.2M) but far under both 2019's John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum ($5.9M, ) and 2023's John Wick: Chapter 4 ($8.9M, best preview cash in franchise).


	We'll have more updates as they happen Friday morning. Lionsgate didn't return our request for comment.

					By Pete Hammond 

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	Pair stars like Julianne Moore and Sydney Sweeney, add BAFTA-winning director Michael Pearce and a top screenwriter of, among others, the Emmy-winning Mare of Easttown in Brad Ingelsby and major producers including Ridley Scott and it is not a surprise that they have collectively cooked up one barnburner of a thriller. And the “barnburner” part you can take literally.


	It is called Echo Valley and will begin streaming on Apple TV+ on June 13, but this could do well in theaters (it supposedly will play in a select few). Nevertheless, it is gripping stuff no matter how you find it.

	











	Moore, in fine form, plays Kate, divorced and now estranged from her ex-husband Richard (Kyle MacLachlan, in all too briefly) and grieving the loss of her wife, also has to deal with an on-and-off relationship with volatile daughter Claire (Sydney Sweeney), who is running with the wrong crowd and hopelessly addicted to drugs. Kate has been doing everything she can to help her and get her back on track. But she is broke thanks to Claire's travails, and even resorts to begging her ex for money to fix her Echo Valley Farm roof which is one storm away from caving in.




			Watch on Deadline		







	To make ends meet she boards horses and gives riding lessons, but it is not enough. Claire has a run-in when her bad-news boyfriend Ryan (Edmund Donovan) shows up with his petty criminal drug dealer Jackie Lyman (Domhnall Gleeson), the latter strong-arming her and demanding the return of a case with drugs that she unknowingly tossed over a bridge during a fight with Ryan. He demands $10,000 until Kate discovers the altercation and kicks him out. After hysterically trying to force money from her mother, Claire takes off. Things don't go well from there and when she finally returns, a mess with blood all over her, Kate asks what happened. Turns out another encounter with Ryan and Jackie ended violently and Kate confesses she accidentally killed Ryan. “Did you go to the police?” her mother asks. “No,” she replies.

	











	At this moment what is a mother who has lost everything going to do with the daughter, no matter how difficult, who is all she has left? “Where's the body?” Kate asks. From this point on hang on to your seat because you will be jumping out of it due to the myriad twists and turns this wild ride takes us on.


	Ingelsby is an exceptional storyteller and has provided a real crackerjack of a thriller with this premise that also examines family dynamics and just how much is too much unconditional love of a mother for her child. For a while I was thinking this is all a great advertisement against ever having kids, and it is only because Moore is just so exceptional in this kind of harrowing situation that you believe she would go as far as she does indeed go for the sake of saving Claire from herself. Echo Valley is the perfect match for someone of Moore's prodigious talents, a role requiring physicality, strong emotions and belief this is a woman with more than one trick up her sleeve to survive and keep what is left of her family together. Sweeney goes for it too, a true powder keg going off at any moment, and she makes Claire into one humdinger of a problem. In Sweeney's hands you can see someone believably falling under the spell of such a dead-end lover, but you just want to lock her up and throw away the key. The dynamic, ever-changing and charged between the two, is palpable.


	Into all this comes Jackie Lyman, and I had no idea it was Gleeson who totally transforms into this creepy little small-time monster who terrorizes Claire, and then most memorably Kate (there are shades of Max Cady from Cape Fear here). Gleeson delivers one of the more convincing bad dude turns in recent years, evil personified but a guy who thinks he is much smarter than he really is. You just hate Jackie, but Gleeson you cannot take you eyes off whenever he is on screen. Among the rest of the cast, Fiona Shaw is excellent as the grounding best friend who tries to calm an increasingly troubled Kate. There is also fine work from Albert Jones as a police detective and Donovan as the loser boyfriend.


	Pearce's slick production is aided immeasurably by Benjamin Kracun's first-rate cinematography and the superb atmospheric production design from Keith P. Cunningham.


	Producers are Ridley Scott, Michael Pruss, Kevin J. Walsh and Ingelsby.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Brooke Burke Says She Woke up Crying on What Would Have Been Her Wedding Day","https://entertainmentnow.com/dancing-with-the-stars/brooke-burke-crying-wedding-date-postponed/","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 01:20:31 GMT","

“Dancing With the Stars” alum Brooke Burke is in a long-term relationship with Scott Rigsby, and the couple has been engaged since September 2021. They should have celebrated their wedding day last week, but had to make the tough decision to postpone, and now Burke is opening up about why they did that.

A post shared by Brooke Burke (@brookeburke)

In an interview with Page Six on May 28, which was published on June 4, Burke was asked about her wedding day, and she revealed that it was meant to be that day. She confirmed that “actually no one knew,” that they had confirmed the date, but they were filled with sadness about not having the ceremony. “Today when I woke up, we were both, like, [crying],” she told Page Six. “We have been so busy. We built a home in Arizona. We blended our family. We moved in together [in Malibu]. We had the fires and then the fires again and the floods.”

Burke also discussed how the last few years had been “weird” for her and Rigsby, and that after being engaged for almost four years, she felt it was “almost embarrassing” when people ask about when she will get married. She doesn't want to stay engaged forever. It is not just her fans who are curious about their wedding, but even their children. Burke confirmed that she and Rigsby would like to have their wedding before the end of 2025.

A post shared by Homeworthy (@homeworthy)

The topic of wedding planning has been something Burke has been asked about several times in the last few weeks. In an interview with People on June 3, she commented again on her upcoming nuptials. She also revealed why May 28 was so special to her (so could 2026 be the year she says “I do?”).

“I had a really weird wish — because I'm a little bit weird — to get married on 5/28, which is the frequency of love,” she told People. The publication reports that the “love frequency” is often thought to be 528 Hz. 

Burke again commented on how they had been busy and the date had to be pushed back again. But she teased, “We gotta do it next year.” The actress referred to herself as being “slow” to get married, but when she does, it's going to be a memorable occasion. “It's got to be big,” she told People. “That's why it hasn't happened yet.”

She continued, “We want to do something different and innovative and show people how to make a difference. But it's not just about writing checks, it's about having fun, telling your story, living out loud, participating. Generational philanthropy. Nobody's talking about that.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘Real Housewives' Star Secretly Ends Engagement but They Remain Amicable","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/real-housewives-star-secretly-ends-engagement/","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 00:55:00 GMT","

Yolanda Hadid and ​​Joseph Jingoli started dating in January 2019 and got engaged three years later. Fans may have assumed they were in the middle of wedding planning, but People reports that they broke up in January 2025. The news had not been reported until now. But what went wrong, and why did the pair end their engagement?

A post shared by YOLANDA (@yolanda.hadid)

“They remain friends and have nothing but fond memories of their time together,” the source said on June 5, People reports.

The former couple first met in 2017 after the “Real Housewives” alum moved to Pennsylvania. In 2022, during a trip to Holland, they became engaged. Still, apart from a few glimpses into their relationship on Instagram and a rare interview, Hadid and Jingoli chose to keep their coupling out of the spotlight. This was a different tactic for Hadid, who has previously been married to Mohamed Hadid and David Foster, the latter of whom featured in the reality show “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.”

No further details on why Hadid and Jingoli broke up have been revealed, but we do know that there was a time when they were incredibly in love. 

A post shared by YOLANDA (@yolanda.hadid)

After Hadid's divorce from Foster in 2015, she took time for herself and had no intentions of dating again. That changed when Jingoli entered her life by chance. “I really started focusing,” she told People in January 2018. “I made a love spiral and wrote down exactly everything that was important to me in a man and he magically just rang the doorbell at the farm.”

She also shared how their health struggles bonded them. “When you meet somebody that thought he was going to die, like I felt I was gonna die, you have a whole new appreciation for life and you kind of share that, so that's really already a common bond that we have,” she said. “To live in the moment, enjoy every day, and not wait. Why take it slow? Let's just go for it and have a great time.”

Hadid has been open about her Lyme disease diagnosis in 2012, and the couple even made their public debut when they attended the Global Lyme Alliance's Annual Gala in N.Y.C. in October 2019. 

Hadid has also celebrated their relationship with Instagram posts, including one on January 9, 2019, marking their second anniversary. “All my life I prayed for someone like you!! “ Hadid captioned a photo of them. “Thank you for being such a bright light in my life, the calm in my storm, and for being the most honorable man that I know.”

Kristin Cavallari's podcast “Let's Be Honest” has been a real hit, and fans are excited about her new docuseries, “Honestly Cavallari: The Headline Tour,” which will offer a behind-the-scenes look at what she's been up to. However, to make this podcast a success, the “The Hills” alum has interviewed many celebrities, and she is not afraid to challenge herself and step out of her comfort zone.

“Honestly Cavallari: The Headline Tour” premiered on Wednesday, June 4, and in an interview with E! News on June 3, she discussed one of her most memorable guests, “Too Hot to Handle” and “Dancing With the Stars” alum, Harry Jowsey.

A post shared by Kristin Cavallari (@kristincavallari)

Cavallari was asked by E! News which guest on her podcast made her laugh the most, to which she replied, “Harry made me laugh a lot. He's just so funny and witty and charming. I always have a good time talking to him.” In the same interview, she also admitted that Jowsey is the person who “shared the most TMI confession.”

“Harry really went for it and did not hold back, which I really appreciated,” she told E! News. “He talked about everything … we covered everything.” Some of the things he discussed were things best not repeated, but he also had tender, emotional moments as he reflected on the death of his father.

Cavallari's interaction with Jowsey was memorable for all the right reasons, but there was another guest she had on whose conversation was slightly more uncomfortable. And that guest was Bobby Flay! “It's hard to get me nervous. It's hard to get me embarrassed or blushing,” Cavallari told E! News. “I guess by default Bobby, only because we were just talking about the miscommunication we had where I thought he was asking me on a date.”

A post shared by Kristin Cavallari (@kristincavallari)

Cavallari has discussed Jowsey before on her “Let's Be Honest” podcast. In an April episode, she admitted that he had sent her a photo of his manhood, Page Six reports. She also posted a picture of herself and Jowsey on Instagram on March 9. The image was one of several that she shared, but she mentioned the reality TV star by name in her caption.

“Chicago got wild!!!! Love my OG Laguna crew and my fave @harryjowsey,” Cavallari wrote. Jowsey reacted to the post with a comment, writing, “Thanks for having me.” And fans have shared their thoughts about how Cavallari and Jowsey would make a great couple. “Date already please!” a comment reads. “You guys look so good!” another fan shared.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘RHOC' Fans React to the Season 19 Trailer: ‘Inject This Into My Veins'","https://entertainmentnow.com/real-housewives/rhoc-fans-react-season-19-trailer/","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 01:20:31 GMT","

The season 19 trailer for “The Real Housewives of Orange County” dropped on June 5, and fans can't wait for the premiere to start.

In the preview shared by Bravo, the cast, which consists of Katie Ginella, Shannon Beador, Emily Simpson, Heather Dubrow, Tamra Judge, Gina Kirschenheiter, and Jennifer Pedranti, are seen taking a polygraph test.

Past “RHOC” star Gretchen Rossi is returning as a friend-of.

A post shared by Bravo (@bravotv)

“There's a snake in the group,” Beador is heard saying. “No one likes a liar,” Judge says. Dubrow adds, “She's not telling the truth.”

It's unclear who they're talking about, the trailer also shows some lighthearted moments from the cast's New Orleans and Amsterdam trip.

Fans are also looking forward to Rossi's return after her departure following season 8. She dredges up her years-long feud with Judge, who tells her, “12 years you've been going after me!”

“Tamra and Gretchen's feud back on screen is a dream come true, now that is an insane old school rivalry. Inject this into my veins!” a fan wrote on X.

Drama between Judge and Pedranti is also revisited from season 18, and it looks like the former Cut Fitness owner also gets into it with Beador.

“Shannon saying, ‘Are you kidding me?' is like the familiar sound of home. Can't wait,” an eager viewer posted.

A few “RHOC” season 19 cast members are already fan-faves and one wrote, “Clocking in to defend Jenn & Gretchen all season!! My absolute [favorites] from new school & old school Orange County!!!”

After Rossi's long hiatus from “RHOC,” Beador is happy to have her on board. “I am excited about it, and she's very kind,” she told Us Weekly in March.

“She's been nothing but sweet to me, so I think she's going to be a good addition,” Beador added.

Beador continued, “We're just finished week three — and the drama's already starting.”

Rossi shared with Us Weekly in April 2021 that she hadn't spoken to Judge in years, so their drama has been brewing before their reunion in the upcoming season.

“Thankfully, we don't really live in the same community, so I don't have to run into her or anything like that,” she said.

The mom of one stated, “I really don't hold grudges, whatever, [let] bygones be bygones, I'm in such a better place in my life than I was dealing with all that on ‘Housewives.'”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘The Voice' Winners Say Michael Bublé Has Kept His Promise To Them","https://entertainmentnow.com/the-voice/michael-buble-winners-coaching-after-show/","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 01:20:31 GMT","

When Adam David won season 27 of “The Voice” in May 2025, he knew it would not be the last time he saw his coach, Michael Bublé. 

Although many contestants never see the celebrity coaches they worked with on the show once their season is over, Bublé promised his back-to-back winners — David and season 26's Sofronio Vasquez — he would continue to be their coach and friend long after the show was over. Both singers have said the superstar is keeping his word.

A post shared by Sofronio Vasquez III (@sofroniovasquez)

Since his win in 2024, Vasquez — the first Filipino singer to win the U.S. version of “The Voice” — has documented some of the ways Bublé has continued to be involved in his life and career, from working on new music to helping him get gigs. 

On June 5, he posted a screenshot from a FaceTime chat he'd just had with Bublé and wrote, “Not only is he my coach from The Voice, which historically made us win, but he also became family. He calls and sends some wisdom and great news for people like me who dream bigger than the world. Thank you, @michaelbuble”

The two reunited on May 7, when Vasquez shared two Instagram posts showing them together in Los Angeles and captioned their joyful selfies by writing, “had a very productive lunch with the man himself @michaelbuble. we skipped dessert because we are on diet LOL 😂”

Vasquez told WKTV in Utica that Bublé has been instrumental in his success since the show, sharing that the Grammy winner “managed to pull in people that he worked with before—like writers, musical producers. And some of the songs that he has written have not been recorded, or he's written new songs just for me.”

Bublé has also made it possible for Vasquez to perform for and with major celebrities, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates in March, when he attended prolific producer David Foster's birthday party for his wife, Katharine McPhee.

Meanwhile, Bublé has also said he plans to be part of David's life and career, too. Right after David won season 27, the Grammy winner told People that he was so excited, he probably wouldn't be able to sleep that night. 

He told the outlet, “You know what? This is personal for me because honestly, when the cameras shut off, we're friends. He's such a good dude. I won't sleep.”

“He had all the talent, all of it, all the ambitions, all of the unique ability,” Bublé continued. “And all I ever did was just, I wasn't coach. I was a buddy, man. Not all of our conversations are music, which is amazing.” 

On May 22, David told Good Housekeeping that he'd already had talks with both his coach and Vasquez about possible collaborations. 

“Obviously, I want to continue growing my relationship with Michael,” he told the outlet. “I don't think I can reveal anything truly, but we've had some conversations about things. And actually, I spoke with Sofronio Vasquez, and we've had some conversations, too.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘American Idol' Star Jamal Roberts Says He's ‘So Happy' He Told Truth About His Childhood","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/jamal-roberts-mom-childhood-comments-heal/?adt_ei=[email]","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 00:00:18 GMT","

As “American Idol” winner Jamal Roberts' star continues to rise, from jam-packed shows to a chart-topping single, the soul singer from Meridian, Mississippi, took time on June 4, 2025, to clarify comments he made about his upbringing days earlier on “The Love You Moore Show.”

Roberts, 27, vulnerably shared with host Willie Moore Jr. that when he was two, his parents separated and his dad gained full custody of him and his older brother. Roberts bravely admitted that he felt “abandoned” by his mom, Kim, and that he struggled to understand why she didn't fight to be with him, especially when she later had more children. But he told Moore Jr. that he was “fine” with not knowing why his mom was so absent years ago and confirmed she is back in his life today. 

After the interview, Roberts was dismayed to see many social media comments and posts that he felt “twisted” his remarks. So, he hosted a nearly hour-long Facebook Live session on June 4, hoping to dissuade people from bad-mouthing his mom and questioning his relationship with her. He also shared how much good came out of him sharing his truth.

“Everybody got something to say,” he said with a smile. “I can't entertain everybody. You wake up in the morning and you making long posts about something that don't even concern you? That ought to just speak for itself. It ain't got nothing to do with you.”

A post shared by Jamal Roberts (@officialjamalroberts)

Roberts tagged his mom during his Facebook Live, which he hosted from his Nashville hotel room as he prepared for the 19 Recordings/BMG Takeover with fellow “American Idol” finalists. Over 3,500 people watched his monologue live, and thousands more have viewed it since. 

The reason he shared the story of his upbringing, Roberts said, was to be transparent and to show how his faith has helped him through challenging times. 

“I'm talking about when you have your own story, like when you know the pros, you know the cons, you know in your mind how you felt in that moment,” he said. “My story is not bashing anybody. My story is simply saying that you can come out of anything. God will walk with you. He'll walk beside you. He'll take you through.” 

Roberts also told his Facebook Live viewers that sharing his story was eye-opening for him and others, explaining, “You know what I found out over all the hundreds of thousands of messages I received? I'm not the only one that's been through that or that has a similar story to me.” 

“I'm so happy I spoke,” he continued, “and I'm so happy to see all the other people that was afraid, all the other people that was in that situation … like, they starting to heal. They were like, ‘Okay, so it is okay.' It's okay! We all go through different battles. It's okay! You're not in it alone. My story is still being written.” 

Roberts' mom, who was frequently seen cheering for Roberts in the “American Idol” studio audience, shared her own Facebook post on the morning of June 4, writing, “GOOD MORNING … I'm not embarrassed about anything I went through what may be tea for some, it is a testimony for me if you're gonna talk about what broke me invite me to the table so I can tell you what God did with the pieces. #Godisgood”

During his Facebook Live, Roberts praised his dad, stepmom, and grandparents for filling the “void” of having an absent parent. He also assured his fans that there are no hard feelings with his mom because his childhood shaped him in many positive ways. 

“My mom is not a bad person,” he said. “We all go through different things, but God's always putting somebody in your life that can just fill that void like he filled that void for me.”

“This is why people don't tell their stories,” he continued. “This is why people don't tell their stories right now, because you got people that will twist it and fold it and make it to whatever they want it to be … taking it out of its original context.” 

Noting that “I'm healing from all that,” Roberts said that his experience with letting go of the past and forging a positive relationship with his mom is part of why Tom Odell's song “Heal” resonated so deeply with him during “American Idol.” Roberts said he hopes his version, a single that immediately shot up the Billboard charts, inspires others to do whatever they need to do to heal emotionally, too.

“I'm healing, I have my parents in my life,” he said, later adding, “I love my mom, I love my dad, I love my family, you know, but at a time in my life, I did feel alone.” 

Before signing off, Roberts sweetly told those watching, “I love y'all. I love y'all, for real. If you don't hear it from nobody else, I love you.”

Darren Aronofsky is supporting the documentation of the Israel-Palestine conflict: The auteur produces award-winning feature “Holding Liat,” directed by Brandon Kramer. “Holding Liat” tells the story of Liat Beinin-Atzili, an Israeli-American woman who was taken hostage by Hamas alongside her husband Aviv on October 7, 2023. Liat and Aviv have been held captive in Gaza with 250 other people, 12 of whom, like Liat, are American citizens.

The film details how Liat's parents, sister, and children had to navigate the American political landscape to try to get her released. The official synopsis reads: “Caught between international diplomacy and a rapidly escalating war, their family must face their own uncertainty and conflicting perspectives in the pursuit of Liat and Aviv's release. This agonizing process, and the ultimate fate of their loved ones, challenges how the members of the family understand themselves and their place in the conflict.Through the intimate lens of a family's experience, ‘Holding Liat' poses complex questions of identity across generations, as the family is thrust into the epicenter of a global conflict rapidly unfolding in real-time.”

“Holding Liat” is an independent production of Aronofsky's Protozoa and Meridian Hill Pictures. The film was a Berlinale documentary award winner and will make its North American premiere at Tribeca 2025. Liat and her family will attend Tribeca screenings and answer audiences questions during the festival.

Director Kramer is actually related to Liat, and knew he had to tell her story onscreen. “This film represents the greatest challenge of my career: it's a deeply personal chronicle of my extended family's intimate experiences, set against the larger Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which continues to impact so many people's lives,” Kramer told IndieWire. “Our team carefully considered the film's rollout, which kicked off with sold-out screenings at the Berlinale – where it was recognized with the Documentary Film Award – and subsequent international premieres in Hong Kong, Brazil, Croatia, Poland, and Israel.” Kramer continued, “As American filmmakers, with a film largely shot in the U.S., the North American premiere is a significant opportunity to reach audiences who are yearning for humane and nuanced storytelling, especially around the complex issues explored in the film. After premiering our last film ‘The First Step' at Tribeca in 2021, it's an honor to return this year with ‘Holding Liat.' We are deeply grateful to Tribeca and our subsequent hometown premiere at DC/DOX for bringing this story to American audiences in a moment that feels more urgent than ever.” 

In a director's statement, Kramer cited how the international conflict is still sadly enduring. “More than a year after October 7, lives are still imperiled: with hostages still held, tens of thousands of Palestinians killed, and people across the region suffering,” he said. “Our conversations about all these issues have only become more polarized, even within communities and families. By telling an intimate story of one directly impacted family, and the way they navigated differences amongst each other, we hope to open up new possibilities for understanding this conflict, and contribute to an end to the unrelenting violence in the region. We are keenly aware that this film is just one family's story out of countless others, and that many important stories may tragically never be told. We hope through the family's resilience and openness, alongside other Israeli and Palestinian films that seek to broaden understanding, audiences will find room to ask deeper questions that help mark a path toward healing and reconciliation.” 

“Holding Liat” is produced by Aronofsky, Justin A. Gonçalves, Lance Kramer, Ari Handel, and Yoni Brook. Aronofsky also has his “Underland” nature documentary, directed by Robert Petit, at Tribeca. 

 










“Holding Liat” will have its North American premiere at Tribeca 2025 as a sales title. Check out a sneak peek below.

An awesomely violent and artfully staged piece of animated pulp, “Predator: Killer of Killers” feels like a movie that was dreamed up by a couple of stoned teenage boys in a suburban basement one night during the summer of 1987, but this is the rare case where that feels like a good thing. A very good thing, even. 

Close your eyes and you can practically hear Dan Trachtenberg — whose impressive “Prey” made him the de facto thought leader of the “Predator” franchise — passing a miserable blunt to screenwriter and co-director Micho Robert Rutare as one of them asks “Who would win in a fight: a Predator or a ninja? What about a Predator or a Viking?” These are some of the great questions of our time, and “Killer of Killers” answers them with enough style and savagery to share a sweet little contact high with everyone who streams it.

The project's charm lies in the fact that it doesn't try to do anything else. An anthology-like collection of death matches in which cinema's most toxically militaristic alien species hunts the greatest human warriors across our planet's history, “Killer of Killers” is so mission-driven and self-possessed that it never feels the least bit like an elaborate teaser for Trachtenberg's forthcoming “Badlands” (a theatrical release that will determine the continued viability of the “Predator” franchise), even if it does a phenomenal job of convincing people to give a shit about the “Yautja” again — or for the first time. 

 










All red meat and no gristle, “Killer of Killers” leapfrogs through the centuries — with occasional flash-forwards into sci-fi territory — as if it were using the “Assassin's Creed” games like a treasure map. The action starts on the shores of Valhalla circa 841 A.D., where a vengeance-obsessed valkyrie named Ursa (voiced by Lindsay LaVanchy) leads her son Anders on a raid to kill the barbarian king who ransacked her village when she was a child. “Why do we fight?,” she asks the boy. “Because our enemy still lives,” he replies. 

Locked into the siege like Timothée Chalamet at a Knicks playoff game in Indiana, the invisibility-cloaked Predator who's watching from the sidelines may have traveled hundreds of light years for a front-row seat to the carnage, but that sort of zero-sum ethos surely reminds him of home. The alien's plan is the same across the first three of the movie's four segments: Let the humans slaughter each other, and then ambush the last — and presumably strongest — warrior standing as a test of its own skill as a hunter. One second Ursa is standing triumphant over the corpse of her enemy, and the next her minions are screaming “Grendel!” as the Predator starts ripping their spinal cords out of their backs and/or pulverizing their bodies into red mush. 

 










While those combat tests have a tendency to be wildly unfair (I'm not sure what a Predator would prove to itself by using a space-age shockwave gun to obliterate a guy holding a wooden spear, but maybe a red-blooded American man who shoots forest animals for sport could explain it to me), the Yautja also have a tendency of failing them in spectacular fashion, as it quickly becomes clear that people are still the most dangerous game. Contextualized as a duel between two different breeds of “monster” (one being Ursa's bloodlust, and the other a demon from outer space), the battle that comprises much of the opening chapter is nothing less than nerd-ass shit par excellence. 

As in subsequent episodes, the movie's “violence is unevolved” moral framing doesn't stop Rutare and Trachtenberg from choreographing the Viking vs. E.T. fight with fetishistic grace, particularly because the CG animation — stilted in its faux-rotoscoped movement, but soaked with the detail and lush ferity of a classic graphic novel — allows them to stage action that would be impossible to sell (or afford) in live-action. Moving away from green screen, the Volume, and other sources of sludgy-looking FX also gives the filmmakers license to make fantastic use of their characters' environments. 

 










A good time for its gore alone, the Ursa brawl is made all the more satisfying because of how cleverly she weaponizes Viking ships against against the Predator, in much the same way as the Japan-set episode that comes next takes full advantage of Tokugawa period architecture as a shinobi hops around a 17th century fortress with a Yautja on his tail (no spoilers, but let's just say the Predators are ill-prepared to fight on the Kawara tiles that lined every 17th castle from Edo on out). 

If “The Sword” maxes out all of the cultural tenets you'd expect an American cartoon like this to exploit, Rutare and Trachtenberg solve the triteness of its story — two brothers, raised by their father as bitter rivals, fight to the death in order to prove their supremacy — by embracing its basicness. Almost entirely wordless from start to finish, the segment pares the sibling rivalry down to its purest level so that it can distill what its characters might be capable of achieving together if they ever fought as one… a theme that “Killer of Killers” will return to with a vengeance in its out-of-this-world fourth segment.

But in order to reach those heights, the movie first has to take to the skies, which it does in a 1942-set chapter about a wide-eyed Navy mechanic (voiced by Rick Gonzalez) who steals a rickety old plane and flies into battle against the Nazi fleet after he becomes convinced that something else has been hiding in the clouds and shooting down all his friends. This episode is slow to take off, as it starts by doubling down on the film's recurring fixation with children proving themselves to their parents (a relevant motif in a franchise preoccupied with self-worth, but one that “Killer of Killers” can only glance at between grudge matches), and its chatty protagonist grows tiresome in a hurry. 

 










But once he's airborne, Rutare and Trachtenberg delight in orchestrating some ultra-graphic aerial mayhem, as our hero tries to outfox a heat-seeking alien jet from the cockpit of a busted tin can. Tom Cruise might have a slight edge when it comes to realism, but Rutare and Trachtenberg giddily compensate for that with stratospheric nose-dives and hailstorms full of disembodied limbs. The gore never quite reaches “Ninja Scroll” levels or anything like that, but “Killer of Killers” is able to maintain a rock-hard R without ever lowering itself to the level of empty titillation. 

By that point in the movie, there's little mystery left as to what Rutare and Trachtenberg are building toward for a grand finale: A melee that will somehow blend Ursa's ambivalent revenge with the ninja's regretful lonerism and the flyboy's inextinguishable resourcefulness. This final segment is a bit sillier and more cartoonish than the ones before it, as “Killer of Killers” is suddenly forced to juggle a variety of (very) different personalities on a hostile alien world whose rules and physics are as rooted in fiction as the film's previous settings were rooted in fact, but there's a satisfying concision to how the script pulls all of its various stories together, and — for a project that could have felt like nothing but fan service — I appreciated that Rutare and Trachtenberg save their movie's only explicit allusion to the rest of the “Predator” franchise until the end credits. 

 










Running a very tight 80 minutes or so between titles, “Killer of Killers” doesn't pretend to be a blockbuster-sized entry in a series that has always struggled to find the right scale for itself, but it even more adamantly refuses to be the sort of throwaway junk that we've been conditioned to expect from straight-to-streaming spinoffs, remakes, sequels, and the like. Fantastic as this film would be to see on the big screen, I'd go so far as to say that this is what streaming should be for: Immaculately crafted bonus treats that stand on their own two feet and demand to be watched with both eyes at the same time as they serve to reinforce the primacy of the theatrical releases that prop them up. In a bottomless content abyss where only the strongest material survives, “Killer of Killers” should have no trouble slaying the rest of its competition on your Hulu home page. 

“Predator: Killer of Killers” will be available to stream on Hulu starting Friday, June 6.

Taylor Sheridan is moving towards the southeast and is planning a spinoff of his hit streaming series “Tulsa King.” But instead of Sylvester Stallone, joining the Sheridan universe is Samuel L. Jackson taking the reins as the mob boss in the French Quarter. 

Specific plot details are being kept under wraps for the series currently titled “NOLA King,” but according to Variety, Jackson's character will make a cameo appearance in the upcoming third season of “Tulsa King,” teeing up the new series. Paramount+ had no comment on the subject. 

 










There's no slowing Sheridan down, and Paramount+ clearly feels there's never too much Sheridan that audiences can handle. “Tulsa King” was the #1 new show back in 2023, and the series at the time of its debut was the biggest single day for sign-ups in Paramount+'s history.

But we also had an idea this could be coming at some point. At TCA in 2023, then Paramount+ streaming chief Tanya Giles told us just as Paramount+ went all in on “Yellowstone” spinoffs, “Tulsa King” could easily get the same treatment because that's just how Sheridan rolls. 

 










“The huge success we've had with ‘Tulsa King' and Sylvester Stallone opens up possibilities with Taylor Sheridan, who consistently, his mind works in terms of universes and backstories, so I think there's always a possibility that there's more to that universe and more to that story. More to come there,” Giles said.

“The Sopranos” producer Terence Winter was originally the writer and showrunner for Season 1, and he left the project before returning for Season 2. The new season is currently in production in Atlanta and Oklahoma.

“Tulsa King” stars Stallone as a former New York mob boss whom after 25 years in prison is cast out to Oklahoma by his former family, only to quickly build his own criminal network. 

Jackson starred most recently in the Netflix film “The Piano Lesson,” and he'll next be seen in the Western “The Unholy Trinity” opening next week. He also previously starred on a streaming series with the Marvel show “Secret Invasion” on Disney+.

Rose Byrne knew she was fated to bring the story of Amanda Ogle to the screen. Byrne stars in “Tow,” based on Ogle's story as an unhoused woman fighting to reclaim her car from a predatory towing company after it refuses to return her stolen vehicle.

“Tow” is premiering at Tribeca 2025 on ​Saturday, June 7. Byrne leads the ensemble cast, which also includes Oscar winners Octavia Spencer and Ariana DeBose, plus Demi Lovato, Elsie Fisher, and “The Holdovers” breakout Dominic Sessa. Stephanie Laing directs from a script written by Brant Boivin and Jonathan Keasey.

 










“It was so moving and wildly original and timely,” Bryne told IndieWire about first learning about the film. “It is a timely tale right now to tell. I am so proud we are bringing Amanda's story to audiences. The fall into being unhoused is full of such assumption, prejudice, and ignorance from people. This tells a story of how it can happen to anyone, and hopefully, in a way that is not like homework but entertaining and moving. She is a character with such fight, humor, and spirit, and I feel the audience will root for her to win.”

Director Laing was determined to have Byrne portray Ogle in the feature, especially after watching her performance on Apple TV+ series “Physical” while on set. “She has such depth and handles tricky tones with a delicate touch,” Laing said of the “If I Had Legs I'd Kick You” star. “Rose disappears in this role. She's also the queen of micro-expressions.”

“Tow” was filmed in only 19 days and for “very little money,” as “Friends and Neighbors” director Laing told IndieWire. “It was a true indie filmmaking process,” she said. “It's a great way to stretch yourself creatively, going from TV to indie films.”

The star-studded cast also made filming easy: “Working with Octavia [Spencer] was a dream,” Laing said. “She was our guiding light. I think Ariana's performance brings the levity and she's funny as hell but those dramatic moments really hit hard. Dominic is such a star and his instincts in the way he played Kevin were spot on. He had a different walk and the he held his hands. I was very lucky to have this cast. And let's not forget to talk about how nice it is to see Simon Rex, also playing opposite of what we've seen him do in the last [‘Blink Twice']. Everyone really came to play and crushed it. And Demi Lovato was fearless.” 

As “Tow” gets ready to speed off into the world, Laing hopes that audiences resonate with Ogle's crusade as much as she did. “When I first read the script I knew I had to tell Amanda's story,” Laing said. “She's tenacious and a fighter. I hope audiences walk away feeling hopeful. In many ways this is a film about being stuck in a broken system with very high stakes. Amanda never gave up. I hope that none of us do, when we need to fight for what is right and just in the world. I also hope we can be more kind. Start there, remember kindness.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","The 50 Best Lil Wayne Songs of All Time","https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/best-lil-wayne-songs/","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

The future seldom arrives on time. Proclamations that a certain technology is about to radically alter our everyday lives are almost always proven wrong: There are no flying cars or robot maids; our life expectancies are holding steady if not declining; the iPod did not, after all, destroy the album as a creative format.

But in the 2000s, as hip-hop was being deconstructed and reformed on and by the internet, Lil Wayne—a one-time child star with a chip on his shoulder about established rappers in his native New Orleans, peers from more critically respected cities like Los Angeles and New York, and the ghosts of the genre's greats—mutated into something like a seer.

His work in that decade, especially the first three Carter albums and the mixtapes released between 2005's Tha Carter II and 2008's Tha Carter III, pulled an entire culture into orbit around his tics, his taste in production and vocal processing, even his most technically and formally daring music.

But his career extends back to Cash Money Records' vaunted late-1990s period, when he was the youngest member of the Hot Boys and was allowed to develop a voice of his own over producer Mannie Fresh's reimaginations of New Orleans bounce music. While his output since the eight-month incarceration he served at Rikers Island in 2010 following conviction on a gun charge has been uneven and hampered by red tape and litigation, he continues to be one of the most widely imitated MCs on the planet, despite the near-impossibility of recreating his chameleonic style.

To commemorate the release of Tha Carter VI, we set out to rank the 50 best songs in his catalog, be they from retail albums, online-only mixtapes, or one of his legendary scorched-Earth guest appearances. This was a preposterous undertaking, like trying to rank the various pixels of a magic eye poster. We considered over a thousand songs with only one guiding principle about his slew of freestyles over other rappers' beats: His version had to be better than the original. Not much was disqualified. –Paul A. Thompson

Here are some things the almighty Triggerman beat has soundtracked: a six-minute murder fantasy about Mystikal, a celebration of New Orleans' Magnolia projects, “The Star-Spangled Banner,” Drake's catchiest grievance, a bounce song about walking like a guy named Ronald, a bounce song about treating a dick like a monkey, a bounce song about Walmart—dozens, maybe hundreds of bounce songs—and this Dedication 5 track. On a technical, lyrical level, ""Thinkin' About You"" is a song about missing a woman half-sung in a Biz Markie register. But partway through, Wayne gets distracted and veers into the Rebirth Brass Band's ""Do Whatcha Wanna,” like he's trying to charge up his depleted swagger. Crying over the world's greatest bounce track, finding strength in a second-line standard—it's so on the nose for a New Orleanian it's hard to believe Treme didn't do it first. –Sadie Sartini Garner

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Thinkin' About You”

“A Milli” is an aura exhibition—the most pointed depiction of unadulterated self-belief we may ever hear in popular rap. I was 7 years old in the back of my dad's SUV when I first heard Lil Wayne's career-defining heat-check, unaware that music could even sound like this: The celestial Disney movie sheen at the start, the cyclopean bass, the stammering Caribbean uncle blurting “A Milli” nonstop; thanks to Bangladesh, it felt like the whip had three discs playing at once in the CD player. At the time, it felt like Wayne was this all-knowing giant who just happened to be 5'5”. He lived inside of his tour bus like a monk in a monastery, recording new tracks daily. If “A Milli” sounds like egoistic brain vomit from a dude on cloud nine, it's probably 'cause it was. It's all so raw that Wayne gets away with so much that would've sounded corny coming from anyone that wasn't him. –Olivier Lafontant

Listen: Lil Wayne, “A Milli”

Let's not overlook Sqad Up, the New Orleans collective in which Lil Wayne shined in his pre-Carter days. Working with other young rappers—peers, not big brothers—yielded a looser, more playful Wayne who got to test his dexterity over popular instrumentals of the early aughts. Some of his best material from that period shows up on the group's 2002 SQ4 mixtape, and a prime example is “Best of Me,” which tries out the beat for R&B singer Mýa's Jay-Z-featuring single of the same name. On the track, Wayne takes cues from Jay-Z putting on an elite display of repetition of wordplay. He was still a teenager, but the flashes of his mixtape-era greatness were clear to see. –Lawrence Burney

Listen: Sqad Up, “Best of Me”

As Rick Ross tells it, his quietly excellent collaborative streak with Lil Wayne came about through one DJ Khaled. In the late 2000s, both Ross' crew and Cash Money were in Miami recording at Hit Factory, with Khaled serving as the conduit between them, passing tracks back and forth. It makes sense that a guy who now lives life as a cartoon character linked them up. There's a kind of bro-ey buddy-comedy energy to all of the Ross and Wayne music, whether they're pretending to be supervillains on “John” or drifting around the club on “I'm on One.” The best Wayne-Ross song, however, is “Luxury Tax.” This was off the second Ross album, when his bread and butter was J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League production so luxurious it left you in disbelief. What's even harder to believe is the ridiculous verse Wayne tees it off with. He pulls off a hilarious MLK comparison here, rivaled closely by the one on “Playing With Fire.” –Mano Sundaresan

Listen: Rick Ross, “Luxury Tax” [ft. Lil Wayne, Trick Daddy and Jeezy]

Let's get this out of the way: Yes, Rebirth is a disaster full of pop-rock experiments that are too slow, too serious, and too corny. Yes, whoever introduced Lil Wayne to Warped Tour, Guitar Hero 3, and Patrick Stump's fedora stash deserves a hell of their own making. Nevertheless, “Knockout” goes crazy. The slurred Auto-Tune rhymes and general nonsense are just right for J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League's production, which aims for Blink-182 but lands at Camp Rock. And Wayne and Nicki, doing some sort of sing-rap-scream, buy into the bit so hard that I'm willing to overlook all the weird Barbie and Ken race play they're doing. “Knockout” was a rare moment that made the now-tired “rapper turned rock star” shtick actually kinda cool. –Alphonse Pierre

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Knockout” [ft. Nicki Minaj]

Another casualty of the rampant bootlegging that preceded Tha Carter III's release, “I Know the Future” is among the most virtuosic in a series of showcases for Wayne's abilities as a vocalist. While the parallels drawn (sometimes by the artist himself) between him and 2Pac are usually semiotic, here Wayne channels what is perhaps Pac's signature skill: his capacity to bludgeon his way through a heavy beat while retaining the dynamism and bend in his voice. –Paul A. Thompson

Listen: Lil Wayne, “I Know the Future” [ft. Mack Maine]

I'm sure that there was a specific fear that came with being a rapper from Louisiana during Lil Wayne's Dedication 2/Da Drought 3/No Ceilings mixtape stretch in the late 2000s, a sensation not unlike when the South Central Los Angeles neighborhood in Friday heard Deebo riding around on his stolen bike, tucking chains and hiding all valuables from sight. This type of local friendly fire on “Watch My Shoes”—Wayne opens it by asking fellow New Orleans natives Gudda Gudda and close friend Marley G why anyone would start with him—makes the original performances from Lil Phat, Shell, and Mouse On Tha Track almost feel passé. Wayne's signature rasp bounds with joy as he compares himself to Papa Bear from Goldilocks, likens his enemies to hors d'œuvres, and name checks Betty Boop over the hypnotic, ripe-for-radio beat. –Matthew Ritchie

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Watch My Shoes”

It's hard not to laugh when Lil Wayne opens this by saying rapping is his hobby. That's a lie. It's not even his occupation. It's closer to a physical condition, his every molecule primed to convert thoughts idle and profound into rhymes. “I'm a Beast” finds him in a druggy flow state, his cadences stretching and compressing as he trundles through a chintzy Sarom beat. He calls himself a beast, a dog, an arsonist, and asks for a drink with no ice because he's wearing enough. The song is quintessential Mixtape Weezy: off-keel, loose, relentless. Even when the song stops, you're certain he could keep going forever. –Stephen Kearse

Listen: Lil Wayne, “I'm a Beast”

By 2004, the once-formidable Cash Money army was mostly fallen soldiers: Juvenile, B.G., and Turk had split from Birdman and gone their separate ways, and Mannie Fresh would be next. Tha Carter, the first truly great album from Wayne—who'd been rapping professionally for a decade at 21—would be Fresh's last one as Cash Money's long-suffering in-house producer. He dials back the belligerence on beats like “Bring It Back,” Tha Carter's lead single, which fashions Wayne's stream-of-conscious mindspray into something basically commercial, suitable for elderly people, twerkers, chickens, ducks, whoadies and whoadettes. “Best rapper alive since the best rapper retired!” the intrepid former child star announces toward the end. A couple years later, he'd be right. –Meaghan Garvey

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Bring It Back”

Did Taylor Swift and them gentrify the swag surf? You could say that. At least Lil Wayne embraced F.L.Y.'s divine brass flurry first. No Ceilings, his '09 Grammys victory lap, opens with an unrelenting 4-minute remix of the HBCU classic. Mixtape Wayne does this thing where he adopts the cadence of whatever track he's stealing from just to prove he could do it better. You see the chrome on this Bugatti, right? It costs way more than that Hypnotik y'all are sipping. With each passing flex and shapeshifting flow he strikes a balance between the punchline magician and the human we maybe don't give enough credit to: “Lost some real niggas I knew from a long time ago,” laments Wayne. “But heaven or hell, I'm hoping that they be where I'mma go.” –Olivier Lafontant

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Swag Surf”

Hip-hop's mixtape boom in the 2000s is usually written about in industrial terms: rappers working outside their contracts with labels or around copyright law. But at its best, the format also allowed for MCs to creep toward the edges of their own styles or attempt ones they admire; to rethink form or abandon it entirely; to truly freestyle. On the first Dedication tape, Wayne took the instrumental from 8Ball & MJG's languid “Mr. Big” and snaked through the folds of his brain: he twists the word “professional” into a Gordian knot to fit a rhyme scheme, he pulls up to the valet “in something Americans can't invent,” and he worries a judge's sentence will be “an algebraic expression.” It would be tempting to say you can hear each line take shape in real time, but there's nothing about it that would be legible to us mortals. –Paul A. Thompson

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Weezy F. Baby”

Lil Wayne becomes the spirit of the trap on “Duffle Bag Boy.” His belted hook addresses hustlers, himself, a lady, and challengers expecting him to back down, his delivery dripping with bravado despite the desperation in his words. Whether there's money owed to him or money to be made, he's going to get it, he swears over a church band's worth of instruments. It feels like he's declaring war against being broke. Tity Boi (still a few years away from his 2 Chainz transformation) and Dolla Boy become bit players on their own song, but that's OK. When Wayne is in his bag, all you can do is watch him work. –Stephen Kearse

When the bling era was spoken into being, it was via the voice of an honor student who thought pulling your shirt up behind your head looked cool. Wayne was 16 years old when he did the hook (and, in the video version, a choppy, stutter-stepping verse) in B.G.'s “Bling Bling,” giving the world a word and a lifestyle that, to a certain type of person, would come to signify everything that was wrong with: rap music, Black folks, uncomplicated pleasure and abundance, and probably helicopters, too. Like “woke,” it's a word that was minted as a token of Black pride that circulated widely, turning into a near-slur now used only by people who buy $550 rhinestone clutches from a sitting president. Pretend for a second you don't know any of that, though. Pretend you've never heard the word at all, and you can see it as Wayne's first miracle, turning a bit of absurd nonsense language into platinum and making himself into a star. –Sadie Sartini Garner

Listen: B.G., “Bling Bling (Radio Version)” [ft. Big Tymers and Hot Boys]

Washing '99 Juvenile and B.G. on a track is like winning a home run derby up against prime Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire. Give that honor to a 16-year-old Lil Wayne on “Niggaz in Trouble,” where, over a galactic Mannie Fresh beat with a bassline fatter than a cut of brisket, he's shot out of a cannon with the intensity that would come to define his mixtape era. “You done pissed off my crew/What y'all gonna' do,” he raps, blacked out. “Look, nigga, you better put a zip on yo' trap/Or you will get trapped.” It's the kind of dick-hanging, foot-on-the-gas shit talk you expect from the fearless young bull of the crew. When that fervor was unleashed, even two of the best rappers in the world had to step aside and let him do his thing. –Alphonse Pierre

Listen: B.G., “Niggaz in Trouble” [ft. Lil Wayne and Juvenile]

Maybe because he was still in high school at the time, Wayne tended to be given bit parts in Cash Money's early hits. A theater kid to his core, he took advantage of that limited time in the spotlight to do things nobody else would or could. He's barely on the title track from the second Big Tymers album, a smooth dollar-tossing cut that feels like a Southern counterweight to “Money Ain't a Thang.” Sounding much more comfortable rolling around the song's lush upholstery than Mannie Fresh or Baby, he lets out a little prrrt—a ridiculous and accurate imitation of a chirping late-'90s cell phone. Baby was paying attention. –Sadie Sartini Garner

Listen: Big Tymers, “How U Luv That” [ft. Lil Wayne]

The first decade of Lil Wayne's career was largely defined by his ability to embrace the insurmountable sums of responsibility that were prematurely placed upon him. His superstardom came as a result of having to carry Cash Money after the rest of the Hot Boys bounced. He welcomed his first child into the world at 16. But, before all of that, as chronicled in Tha Block Is Hot's “Up to Me,” an adolescent Dwayne Carter Jr.'s first grown-up test was to reckon with the murder of his stepfather, Reginald “Rabbit” McDonald. With a hardly-deep voice, Wayne addresses Rabbit with a series of life updates: his new status as a father, him earning a hefty amount of his own money as a rapper, and how he's able to take those funds to take care of his grieving mother. On the hook, Turk lends his close buddy some encouragement, suggesting that, even though he's at the driver's seat of his family's destiny, it'll all turn out fine. –Lawrence Burney

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Up to Me”

As the 2000s gave way to the 2010s, Wayne started to become a shell of the consistent rhymer he had been in the Bush era, his flows slackening from verbose bursts to digestible mid-tempos, his taste in beats to remix less audacious and more predictable. So, when I listen to the first Dedication tape, I savor it, knowing I'm hearing a rap legend will himself into being that. Dedication includes the most underrated Wayne remix, “I'm a Ridah,” a 21st century update of 2Pac's “Made Niggaz.” In a hoarse voice, Wayne almost steals Tupac's classic out from under him. Pac was a great rapper; here, Wayne's better. –Jayson Buford

Listen: Lil Wayne, “I'm a Ridah”

If there is an unofficial breakup anthem for those raised on LimeWire and DatPiff, it's Wayne's “I'm Single.” It's one of the standout melodic songs of his Best Rapper Alive era. Hearing him go through the trials and tribulations of a toxic relationship and how to move on from the dealings of an unhappy relationship with his sing-songy Auto-Tune voice, was a twist for the rapper known for the filthiest sex punchlines. Credit to the touch of vulnerability goes to Drake's mushy writing and 40's groggy production that Wayne makes sexier and more emotional. –Nia Coats

Listen: Lil Wayne, “I'm Single”

A few times a year, a screen grab of an ancient article from Vibe Magazine titled “The 77 Best Lil Wayne Songs of 2007” (written by one-time Pitchfork contributor Sean Fennessey) goes viral. People who weren't there find it hard to believe there were 77 Weezy songs in a year worth writing about, while people who lived through it admire the fact it was cut down so precisely. That was arguably Wayne's most prolific, and most impressive year, despite the fact that his only official release was The Leak, an EP of already-available songs that was basically a money grab dropped on Christmas.

In 2007, if Wayne decided to rap on your beat, it was an honor. The only caveat was that it was no longer your song, it was now his. And no song is a better example than “Sky Is the Limit,” an undeniable mixtape anthem which lifted the instrumental from Mike Jones' “Mr. Jones.” Wayne performs this track at most of his concerts—where fans sing along word for word—most forgetting it originally belonged to Mike Jones (WHO?!) They'd have a better chance of remembering Jones' phone number. –Andrew Barber

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Sky Is the Limit”

Jacking the Roots' “Star,” Lil Wayne honors his mother by talking exquisite shit. Where the original is melancholic and smooth, Wayne's spin is mischievous. He condemns pimping and flippantly endorses slavery. He keeps pulling a trigger even after the clip is empty and declares himself Mister Daisy from the backseat of his whip. And he doesn't simply stay strapped: He eats, sleeps, shits, and bathes with his gat. But he doesn't draw attention to this ambient absurdity, locking into a groove with the drums and leisurely unspooling his thoughts. In Wayne's loopy world, the surreal is mundane. Happy Mother's Day. –Stephen Kearse

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Momma Taught Me”

It's entirely possible that 18-year-old Lil Wayne's response to the idea of imposter syndrome setting in following his stunning debut 1999 Tha Block Is Hot would be “What the hell is that?” The greatest evidence of the teenage prodigy's self-efficacy is “Get Off the Corner,” the lead single off his second album, Lights Out. Surrounded by sparse drum patterns, blaring horns, and intermittent police sirens, all woven together by Mannie Fresh, Wayne's nearly five-minute, anxiety-tinged tirade reveals an intense hunger from the Hot Boys' youngest member. He makes each nook and cranny of the block his home, tweaking his voice to creak and croak with almost every punchline about drug dealing and finishing beefs. By the time the gruff repetitions of “you better get off the corner” trail off in the outro, it's clear that “Get Off the Corner” was the final warning shot that Wayne was out to dominate rap's Monopoly board. –Matthew Ritchie

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Get Off the Corner”

Despite being overshadowed by popular tracks like “Prostitute” and “I Feel Like Dying” from the unofficial and often overlooked Da Drought Is Over 2, “Diamonds and Girls” was the song I spent the summer reciting to memory on the streetcar from Uptown to the Riverwalk in New Orleans. Wayne approaches the bouncy Prince sample like a world-famous stand-up comedian testing out new ideas at a low-capacity comedy club, cracking hilarious one-liners (“And here's my most funniest joke–I'm broke”) and dishing out sharp, economical similes like an exercise in creative decluttering. In the second verse, one of the best of the mixtape era, he accelerates his cadence and effortlessly rhymes everything you can imagine with “diarrhea.” It's a quintessential Wayne closer that sticks with you decades after the first listen. –Nigel Washington

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Diamonds and Girls” [ft. Curren$y]

Also known as “B.M. JR II,” this leak, usually dated to the period between Carter II and III, showcases some of Wayne's clearest writing and most advanced technique. He scurries from pocket to pocket in the cascading beat, his always-elastic voice feigning strain to call attention to rhyme schemes as he stretches them to cartoon proportions. The second verse is one of the most breathless and breathtaking runs in his whole catalog. By the time he promises to “appeal when they extradite us,” you can't imagine a court disagreeing. –Paul A. Thompson

Listen: Lil Wayne, “When You See Me”

At the pre-show of the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards, Lil Wayne, filling in for T.I., had to come up with an impromptu guest verse to tack onto Nicole Scherzinger's by-the-books single “Whatever U Like.” With a casual flow that made it unclear whether his verse was already written or freestyled on the spot, he killed it by hitting Nicole with his flirty swag: “Can't pronounce her last name, so it should be mine.” That's Wayne, a natural smooth-talker who knows how to give an edge to R&B tracks. One of his best moments in the genre was on the remix to Bobby Valentino's “Tell Me.” The need to keep things radio friendly is what really expands his imagination, and, over a mad violin beat by “Thong Song” creators Tim & Bob, he goes in for two intimate yet restrained verses where he's eyeing a baddie from across the bar. It's like one of those old Hays Code rom-coms that tiptoed around sex, all innuendo and all the better for it. –Alphonse Pierre

Listen: Bobby Valentino, “Tell Me (Remix)” [ft. Lil Wayne]

Wayne already wrote the “Hustler Musik” blurb when he compared himself to Scarface with a cigar dangling off his lip. The song sounds exactly like that, pure motivation and calm ruthlessness in three verses. Super-charged with T-Mix and Batman the Producer's live organ, brass, bass and drums, “Hustler Musik” is like if the top floor of a hotel were a rap song, Wayne channeling shiny suit-era Biggie and Jay as bars tumble out in a relaxed, methodical flow. There's no hook in his catalog as effortlessly cool as the head-to-the-sky mantra here. And Wayne has this way of transforming the typical rapper documentation of the ‘fit into a scientifically precise poetry: see how he flits from describing the Nina in his palm (“now I'm masturbating”) to drawing out the assonance of “Bathing Ape, Yves St. Evisu what I stay in.” –Mano Sundaresan

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Hustler Musik”

When they got together, Lil Wayne and Mannie Fresh were like teenagers in a 1980s sex comedy. Nothing else was on their minds but getting ass. But compared to earlier joints from the pair, like “Break Me Off” and “Drop It Like It's Hot,” Tha Carter's “Hoes” is less concerned with handjobs or whatever but the characteristics of the girls they're bringing back to the bachelor pad. Wayne's list includes: WNBA players with straight backs, short-haired girls who look like “The old Halle Berry/Or the broke Toni Braxton,” and the freaks around the way. Mannie, a true vet of the player game, gets more specific: Shelly who liked to bump Pac and eat fast food, Shawna the pothead, and Patrice who went to jail for trying to stab her niece for also fuckin' with Mannie. It's about as mature as their horndogging gets. –Alphonse Pierre

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Hoes” [ft. Mannie Fresh]

At first, “Shine” was just an album cut tacked on Lil Wayne's sophomore LP, Lights Out. But as 2025 streaming numbers reflect, it almost instantly became that record's most popular track. “Get Off the Corner” was a great choice for the first single, but “Shine” was what the people really wanted. You heard it at parties and DJs played it in the clubs; by the summer of 2001, Cash Money was all but forced to release it as a single. Mannie Fresh's space bloops paired with the Hot Boys' colorful bars were just too infectious to be ignored.

But by the time “Shine” got the single treatment, cracks were beginning to form in the CMR foundation. Juvenile and B.G. had gone AWOL, leaving the label to drop a video for the “Shine (Remix),” featuring a non-Hot Boy lineup. Sure, Mack 10 and Mikkey Halsted did their thing, but there was nothing like that Hot Boys chemistry—even if this was the beginning of the end for the group. –Andrew Barber

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Shine” [ft. Hot Boys and Mannie Fresh]

While New Orleans rappers competed for a piece of the scene after the Hot Boys breakup, Lil Wayne was aiming for something bigger: NYC. On “Oops,” off the first Sqad Up tape, Wayne effortlessly repurposes Tweet's sultry “Oops (Oh My)” with chillingly descriptive punchlines like, “In ya tummy where the Semi would go/And I pull the trigga right after I whisper ‘gimmie ya coke.'” And in the last minute, Wayne calls out New York DJs like Kay Slay and Funk Flex to recognize the South and its new leader. “Oops” is an early peek at Wayne's blueprint for future mixtapes, bending popular beats to his will and crowning himself king whenever he feels like it. –Nigel Washington

Listen: Sqad Up, “Oops” [ft. Lil Wayne]

With a verse sandwiched between fellow Hot Boys B.G. and Juvenile, a then-15 year old Lil Wayne made it clear on “Ride or Die” that he is not a normal rapper. His voice here is meeker than the cigarette-stained one we've all come to know, but the way he uses his thick New Orleans accent to rhyme nearly every syllable is an indicator of the alchemy that was to come. I'm not sure who else could rhyme “windows closed” with “stay on the floor” while articulating a quest for revenge that involves a puddle of blood too deep to swim through. –Millan Verma

Listen: B.G., “Ride or Die” [ft. Lil Wayne and Juvenile]

Tha Carter was preceded in early 2004 by The Prefix, a mixtape where Wayne—who has “Lucky Me” tattooed on his neck and lyrics from that song on his leg—tries his hand at an array of beats from Jay-Z songs. While it would take until 2007's “Dough Is What I Got” for hip-hop to really process that Wayne had replaced Jay atop the food chain, in '04, Wayne was already improving the blueprint. “Snitch” is Wayne's sinister variation on Jay's circa-Black Album, Young Chris whisper-flow mode: dipping in and out of conspiratorial asides, taking glee in the fusion of pop production and swaggering gun talk. The third verse in particular is a master class, the final 12 bars hammering the same rhyming syllables before it ends in a vicious anti-climax: “Shhhhhhhh.” — Paul A. Thompson

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Snitch”

Lil Wayne's greatest Auto-Tune stuff uses the tool for passion and super leaned-out flexing. With “Get Bizzy,” Wayne punchlines that seem pretty standard on the page (“Mama said knock ya out, money made me block ya' out”) become all-timers through his muddy and distorted delivery. He does this on the beat for V.I.C.'s “Get Silly,” a snap-rap club classic that he warps into a foggy smokers' joint off a Screw tape, with how thick the vocal effects are and how he sounds like he's trailing off after every bar. Wayne made the Auto-Tune pop, not the other way around. –Alphonse Pierre

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Get Bizzy” [ft. Gudda Gudda]

Zone out long enough to “Dough Is What I Got” and you'll forget that Jay-Z even recorded that flabby Kingdom Come single on this beat as part of his return from retirement. When you get a beat from Just Blaze at his peak powers, turning up the dials on everything and letting the drums rip, you gotta come with that same energy, and Lil Wayne lands on a labyrinthine scheme in the first verse, taunting his competition just a little when he says he's LeBron to Jay's MJ. It was a beat jack so crushing that it allegedly made Jay-Z take a long walk, then stare at himself in the mirror and ask, “Are you sure you still got this?” –Mano Sundaresan

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Dough Is What I Got”

Despite having been a rapper for nine years, and despite having been a successful one for over two, when Lil Wayne's debut album, Tha Block Is Hot, came out in 1999, he was still just a kid. “Fuck tha World” is a harsh reminder of that. Freshly 17, the pride of Hollygrove runs through a laundry list of grievances that were gnawing at his mind, trading his typically boastful bars for tenderness and vulnerability. His step-father, Rabbit, who acted as his father figure, had recently been shot and killed; Wayne's first child had been born a year before; and he was responsible for keeping his mother's lights on. This song isn't the result of teenage angst—it's the sound of someone carrying far too much on his shoulders. –Millan Verma

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Fuck tha World”

In the early 2000s, Lil Wayne, as Cash Money's last Hot Boy, was tasked with having to graduate from the party-starting golden boy to a young man asked to keep a flailing empire alive. On “I Miss My Dawgs,” from 2004's Tha Carter, Wayne masterfully expresses the weight of that responsibility and dedicates his verses to the three Cash Money escapees (B.G., Juvenile, and Turk). He heightens the poignancy, at the end of his verses to B.G. and Juvenile, when he grunts, “I miss you and I know you missing me.” In essence, the song is a eulogy for one of rap's greatest runs, from the mouth of someone who helped facilitate it, painfully accepting he'll never get it back. –Lawrence Burney

Listen: Lil Wayne, “I Miss My Dawgs”

Surprised there isn't more Dedication 2 on here? The voting committee observed that while it's still one of Wayne's best, and was a key part of the run that elevated him to the Best Rapper Alive convos, it functions better as a straight-through listen than a collection of songs that can be singled out from the tracklist. There are a couple exceptions, though. “Cannon” is undeniable. The beat, peppered with producer Don Cannon's DJ tags, hits like a ton of bricks. And Wayne makes slight work of it. Beyond the knotty wordplay, it's all about the linguistic acrobatics he pulls off here: how he punctures the beat with those sticky, staccato phrasings of “sick” and “spit” and “vomit,” and his pronunciation of “MY-yo-nnaise” to make the rhyme work. –Mano Sundaresan

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Cannon”

There's a violent undercurrent in Lil Wayne's life, even if you would be hard-pressed to consider him outright menacing. The gun he got caught with by the hip-hop police on a tour bus in New York led him to have to serve eight months out of a 365 day sentence; at 12, he shot himself in the chest after his mom said he couldn't rap for Cash Money Records, an incident he would later classify as a suicide attempt. It would behoove you to listen to “Lights Off,” the best song on Wayne's debut, Tha Block Is Hot. Even at the young age of 17, he's rapping about being a gun-toting freak, a boy looking at Tony Montana's final scene in Scarface for the first time. Is Wayne a shooter? Probably not. But he is a boy attempting to be a man, in the shadows of a Southern masculinity that's been indoctrinated into him since he was a kid. Guns haven't always been useful for Wayne but it's a protector, a shield for him as a boy forced to raise himself up by his comically large bootstraps. –Jayson Buford

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Lights Off”

The provenance is not really the point. Technically the seventh and final Sqad Up mixtape, the 35-minute exorcism more commonly known as “10,000 Bars” was allegedly a purging of the notebooks Wayne was determined to leave behind forever as he pivoted to composing songs in his head. Whether or not that's literally true, he raps—viciously, nimbly, with an endlessly regenerative energy—over 26 different beats, and in nearly twice as many flows, he flits between close studies of his influences' styles and whole-cloth creation. Though he pitched it as the end of one era, it was really the Big Bang for another, the beginning of the mercenary, chaos-agent streak that would make him that rarest of things: an artist on the cutting edge of his genre who also dominates the pop chart. –Paul A. Thompson

Listen: Lil Wayne, “10,000 Bars”

What better way for Lil Wayne to submit another entry into a strangely personal, “Hot N Cold” type relationship with Jay-Z than hopping on the beat of Hov's collaboration with then-girlfriend Beyoncé “Upgrade U?” The palace intrigue of rap's upper echelon aside, the jubilant production that usually was reserved for Beyoncé's vocal runs is ripe for Wayne's freewheeling style. His buoyant, staccato raps bounce around in the beat's negative space like supercharged electrons as he rattles off references to Anita Baker, Angelina Jolie, and Apollo Creed, crafting a bizarro world version of jaunting, truncated bar construction employed on the original version. And if the odd subliminal aimed at Jay-Z slips out at the end, it's almost to be expected considering his chuckling intro: “I love this shit/So let me talk my shit, ‘nah mean?” –Matthew Ritchie

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Upgrade”

By 2006, Wayne was no longer playing second fiddle to Juvenile or BG; he was a full blown star, inching closer to true A-list status. Birdman's profile as an executive also continued to grow—especially as he had survived the loss of his biggest artists and key producer and, through Wayne, found a new lease on mogulhood.

Instead of rushing to release the long-awaited Tha Carter III, Wayne got with his non-biological dad to release Like Father, Like Son—a bit of a hidden gem in the Cash Money catalog. “Stuntin Like My Daddy” was the monumental lead single, and it accomplished everything it set out to do: let Wayne make a lyrical hit record without Baby getting in the way. And while Wayne does most of the heavy lifting here, as on the album writ large, Birdman does add the perfect complement. “Stuntin' Like My Daddy,” brought out the best out of both Baby and Weezy, without trying too hard – and likely sold a whole lot of Yamaha V-Stars in the process. –Andrew Barber

Listen: Birdman & Lil Wayne, “Stuntin Like My Daddy”

Imagine for a moment if Tha Carter III began with “I'm Me” instead of “3 Peat,” as was intended before the former leaked. It would've made it feel biblical, Wayne kicking off the record that put him on the top of the world with a song that unabashedly celebrates rap music as a form (and compares the album you're about to hear to the New Testament). On one level, “I'm Me” is a State of the Rap Union, opening with the smugly sighed, “Un-fucking-believable! Lil Wayne's the president.” But it's really just Wayne telling us he loves this shit in as many creative ways as possible. He's married to the “crazy bitch” like Keven Federline. He wants to rap until he's literally shitting himself. Then there's the chorus, so simple yet defiant: “I'm ME.” I don't know how this can't get you fired up. –Mano Sundaresan

Listen: Lil Wayne, “I'm Me”

You can't forget that Lil Wayne was a child star. It's fashionable to focus on his explosive, relentless run in the mid-2000s, but doing so to the exclusion of his early work is to miss the point entirely. 1997's “Block Burner,” from the Hot Boys' debut album, is startlingly great, an example of Juvenile's influence on young Wayne's career. However, where Juve was a gruff, bluesy soldier, Wayne was more melodic, more nimble, loquacious even at this early age. Here he sounds as clean as Rakim and raps in legato a fusillade of bars that sound as cool as a cigarette after sex. Just 17 at the time Get It How U Live! was released, Wayne is the greatest child star of the past 30 years of music; the only reason why we don't think of him as a child star is because Black boys aren't allowed to be considered kids in the eyes of white America. –Jayson Buford

Listen: Hot Boys, “Block Burner”

Before Lil Wayne's galactic ascension in 2004, there was the growing fear that the New Orleans rapper's star was dwindling amid a Cash Money Records that had been all but deserted. Another prodigal son burned out far too early by circumstances unforeseen, as the subsequent follow-ups to his blistering debut Tha Block Is Hot failed to live up his own standard commercially (and qualitatively). Enter “Go DJ,” the purest encapsulation of the formula that would propel Wayne into a new stratosphere over one of Mannie Fresh's best beats: a banging hook that echoes off the walls of clubs and basketball gyms (upcycled from a 1997 U.N.L.V. track), audacious declarative statements (Oh, to be the “hottest nigga under the sun”), and a barrage of bars that leave you with a stank face. The mutated synths and alien beeps place Wayne in a spaceship flying high over rap's earthbound underlings, where he'd remain for the rest of the decade. –Matthew Ritchie

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Go DJ”

After years of honing his craft with beat-jacking mixtapes, a new chapter of Lil Wayne opened in the mid-2000s. He was more poised, more sure of his own power, and began radiating an aura that was irresistible to a generation of fans whose childhoods were spent watching him evolve into this new form. Few songs from his catalog reflect that effortless coolness like “Mo Fire,” from 2005's Tha Carter II. The track creeps along, moving at the speed of someone who's enjoying a euphoric weed high, and, with the help of an uncredited Caribbean vocalist, he fully leans into the Bad Man aesthetic. If there's a song that perfectly reflects Tha Carter II's artwork—Wayne in black and white, shirtless, dreads hanging while he leans back onto a Rolls-Royce Phantom—it's this one. –Lawrence Burney

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Mo Fire”

Wayne is from Hollygrove, and while his dominance in the 2000s was taken as both a cause and symptom of rap's power balance shifting south, there were times when it was undeniable: He wished he was from Harlem. On Dipset-extended universe cut “Beat Without Bass,” Wayne is now inheriting two beefs that Cam'ron was pan frying: Nas and Jay-Z. The result? Wayne stakes his claim for rap superiority, making these old rappers look in the mirror with anxiety, maybe even shame. The Timbs and the Myspace profiles and the ringtones and the Canal St. tapes blurred together in a perfect little bit of alchemy. –Jayson Buford

Listen: Freekey Zekey, “Beat Without Bass” [ft. Lil Wayne and Jha Jha]

Like most people from Louisiana who no longer live there, Weezy is always looking for an opportunity to tell people how much he loves it. So it feels right that the sweetest song he's ever recorded isn't about a lover or weed or even Baby. “Born in New Orleans, raised in New Orleans, I will forever remain faithful, New Orleans,"" he raps over a “Chopsticks” two-finger piano chord sampled from the New Birth's “You Don't Have to be Alone.” Also pulled from that pretty obscure record: a chirpy “la la la” melody that, pitched up and skipping over the drum beat, makes Wayne's memories of biking through Hollygrove hiding crack in his mouth (“I hope it don't dissolve”) feel as nostalgic as his memories of getting a scooter for Christmas and rocking a Saints Starter jacket. –Sadie Sartini Garner

Listen: Lil Wayne, “La La La”

After Hurricane Katrina tore through New Orleans, Wayne moved to Miami. Rapping from afar, his peak period is littered with references to his hometown that are at turns pained and defiant; one thinks of him insisting, on Da Drought 3, that “They tried to make a brand-new map without us… And no matter how you change it, it'll still be ours.” His flip of Ludacris and Field Mob's “Georgia” is the searing, soulful explication of his rage at the administration that flooded the city. There's the droning, atonal hook (“We from a town where/Everybody drowned”), the indignance over structural problems that had only worsened since 1965's Hurricane Betsy, the simple relaying of stories from those who lived through the levees and “heard explosions.” There's also what is the most memorable, most chillingly plainspoken passage of this period in Wayne's work: “The white people smiling like everything cool/But I know people that died in that pool/I know people who died in them schools.” –Paul A. Thompson

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Georgia… Bush”

As Lights Out gave way to 500 Degreez, Lil Wayne was no longer the cute child rapper; he was growing up and struggling to find his footing in a fast-changing business. He was still around, but would be overshadowed whenever Juvenile decided to show his face—and he couldn't go hit-for-hit with the Big Tymers. But in 2004, something changed, and Wayne transformed into the goblin we know now. Once he proclaimed he was the “best rapper alive, since the best rapper retired” people started paying attention, whether they believed him or not.

Tha Carter revealed a new artist—one who could make hits and compete lyrically with not just his labelmates, but hip-hop's elite, like his idol Jay-Z. C1 has been largely eclipsed in the public imagination by its Carter successors, but remains the most upbeat and bouncy of the series. “Who Wanna” is its mission statement, with Wayne sending shots at all detractors, doubters, and non-believers. “Who Wanna” is perhaps the best example of a C1 song that hits Wayne's sweet spot: perfectly meshing his past sound (futuristic New Orleans bounce) with the lyrical chops and catchy hooks that would define the next six years of his career. –Andrew Barber

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Who Wanna”

Lil Wayne is standing on a nondescript street corner somewhere in New Orleans. Business is slow, and he's desperate to find his next hustle. Up walks Baby, a big-time pimp and dealer from around the way, and they meet eyes. “I been peepin' ya' lil' ass, I see you grindin' and shit,” raps an impressed Baby, like he's searching for new recruits for his street mentorship program. An overly eager and headstrong Wayne, clearly schooled on the hip-hop storytelling cuts of the '80s and '90s, gasses him up right back: “I been peepin' you, too, nigga I see you shinin' and shit/And you don't even know how long I been tryna' find me a brick/To make it flip and take the chips and go buy me a whip.” I could quote the whole damn song. “Lil' One” is that good, as the eventual Like Father, Like Son collaborators size each other up and go line-for-line. The story ends with Birdman putting Wayne onto game in the car, and you can imagine his lavish rise and tragic, hubristic fall without them even saying it. It could be a conversation straight outta The Wire. –Alphonse Pierre

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Lil' One” [ft. Big Tymers]

Even back then, it was clear that Da Drought 3 was the future: 100-plus minutes of rap at its most free-wheeling and postmodern, on which Wayne chews up the industry and spits it out, dissatisfied. If you believe that words are the most powerful things in the universe, then the 24-year-old is at the height of his over a beat jacked from Young Dro's “Shoulder Lean.” Here he pantomimes chaos with the utmost control and lets loose a handful of all-time great one-liners: a morbid Ritchie Valens nod, a half-hearted anti-drug PSA, a line that zaps my synapses some 18 years later (“I gets hotter by the tock/Before I sizzle to death, I just tell the clock, ‘Gimme a sec!'”). Having downloaded the tape on my slow-ass Ethernet hook-up, I remember feeling alive with possibility, like if you strung together certain words in just such a way, you could restructure the universe. –Meaghan Garvey

Listen: Lil Wayne, “Live From 504”

It's widely accepted that Lil Wayne had one of rap's greatest runs, that he got to say the culture's heaviest phrase and have it feel right: I am the best rapper alive. Usually, that's considered to be the time period between Dedication 2 and Dedication 3 when he perfected his superstar persona and managed to flood the e-streets and radio airwaves at the same time. But there is part of me that actually believes Wayne was at his creative peak on 2004's Tha Carter, where the Cash Money little brother with a chip on his shoulder collides with the looser, throne-craving supernova, ready to burst.

Tha Carter was Wayne's last full ride with Mannie Fresh, even though neither of them really knew it at the time. The album marked the culmination of a truly great partnership, with Wayne no longer following Mannie's lead, but the producer meeting the rapper where he was at. “On My Own” is the best example of their connection, with Mannie's shimmering bounce crackling like battered chicken in hot oil and Wayne showing his relentless desire for the crown. In an unpredictably groovy rap-sing, Wayne reflects on his past, throws the Hot Boys under the bus (“Out of all the Hot Boys, she say I'm the coolest”), and tells the hip-hop world to get with it or get left behind: “So roll the carpet out/'Cause you fuckin' with a nigga from the royal South/See, you're either in or you're out.” It's the hungriest rapping from the poster boy of hungry rapping. It's also perfectly fitting for Wayne that his highest high comes not on a radio hit, a high-profile beat-jack, or even on the culturally defining Tha Carter III, but just locked in with Mannie Fresh on Tha Carter, Track 8. –Alphonse Pierre

In 1984, members of Crass—the revolutionary anarcho-punk band and art collective from England—self-published the leaflet You're Already Dead to hand out at their shows. In it, they touted the merits of creating pure art instead of “consumerist products,” putting in the hard work of direct action, and fighting for a world where punk isn't derivative, escapist, or boring. “It is our job to reclaim beauty and intelligence, dignity and truth,” the band wrote. “NOW IS THE TIME TO CONSTRUCT OUR OWN REALITY.” That year, Crass were touring behind their album Yes Sir, I Will, from which they stitched one lyric onto a huge black-and-white banner. While the band thrashed around onstage, the words burned into the eyes of the audience: “There is no authority but yourself.”

Turnstile, by comparison, are a largely apolitical band. Whereas Crass spat lengthy tirades about Margaret Thatcher and fought for a feminist future, Turnstile singer Brendan Yates writes vignettes about overcoming dejection and turns nonconfrontational refrains like “I need a little T.L.C.” into hooks. But both bands share a DIY ethos: the belief that communal self-determination is the root of broader change. To watch Turnstile's evolution over the past 15 years has been to watch them embrace what it means to be yourself. Nonstop Feeling angled it as an enticing alternative in the youth scene, while Time & Space found catharsis in introspective self-growth. Then came 2021's Glow On, which uncorked how liberating it feels to enter adulthood with self-assurance and understanding, its stadium-worthy riffs courting the masses alongside go-go beats and fluttering synths.

Four years later, Yates realizes maintaining that mentality is just as difficult as reaching it in the first place. “Running from yourself now/Can't hear what you're told,” he admits at the opening of Never Enough, Turnstile's new album. The 35-year-old singer is downtrodden, to put it lightly, and nursing a broken heart. Though Yates holds narrative at a distance, opting to focus on emotion, time is constantly slipping through the hourglass: “24 hours ain't the day it used to be,” “Time is happening devastatingly,” “Days into years holding out.” Yates delivers the anxious words with the gusto of someone granted several extra decades to live. That's generally how it goes with age: As time speeds up, so does our determination to spend it more authentically.

Turnstile experiment more freely than ever on Never Enough. They incorporate Glow On's pop sheen to revitalize a period of '80s nostalgia when punk bands softened into radio rock. “Light Design” merges now-classic Turnstile rhythms with the Police's pedalboards and cool-toned synths. “I Care” goes even further; drummer Daniel Fang finds levity in bulbous drumrolls and gated reverb like Stewart Copeland, and when Yates pushes into a higher register, he passes for an Americanized Sting. Franz Lyons' spry bassline and Pat McCrory's echoing guitar in “Seein' Stars” could retroactively slot into Zenyatta Mondatta. Most impressive is how comfortable Turnstile sound in this attire.

With much of Never Enough recorded at Los Angeles' famed villa-turned-studio the Mansion, it's tempting to drag a finger down the alumni list for a mix-and-match comparison: Blood Sugar Sex Magik with a bit of This Is Happening? In reality, Never Enough isn't a Mansion album in sound; it does, however, display the oft-touted clarifying capabilities of that studio in its lyrics. “When I get to dreaming, then I know/Everything I feel is surreal,” Yates sings in a trance. With no deadline or ticking financial clock, Turnstile relished “living in [their own] music” for months. That's what fame and success get you: time to explore and poke and prod, even if external expectations and critiques amplify in tandem.

So why does Never Enough feel like Turnstile are still holding back? “Slowdive” and “Sole” land like satisfying but familiar Glow On B-sides thanks to recognizable vocal melodies and chord progressions. That first-listen déjà vu could be avoided if Turnstile continued what they half-attempt elsewhere, like segueing from heavy rock riffs into a cinematic overlay of drone, flittering piano, and cello warped to emulate seagulls on “Never Enough.” Or shaking up the rigid guitar in “Dreaming” with trumpet and saxophone, which inject a playfulness akin to the horns in the Cure's “Close to Me” or Elvis Costello's “Let Them All Talk.” That fruitful reunion between Turnstile and saxophonist Leland Whitty of BadBadNotGood, who hardstyled their way to a joint Grammy nomination, is a no-brainer. Slick production and experimentation aren't diminishing Turnstile's sound; they're enhancing it.

Maybe the thinness of Never Enough is simple math. Although Turnstile are a five-piece, with guitarist Meg Mills joining after the 2022 departure of Brady Ebert, they wrote and recorded Never Enough as a quartet. That leaves McCrory as the lone guitarist on the album, and his parts shiver with no second guitarist to bounce off of. Even Lyons gets buried in the mix—a shame, since he's been honing his bass skills in lessons with Fugazi's Joe Lally. (There's plenty of surprising guests, too—Hayley Williams, A. G. Cook, Faye Webster—but they're near-impossible to discern.) Then again, it could just reflect Turnstile's feelings of isolation. “My head is overjoyed/And this is where I wanna be/But I can't feel a fucking thing,” Yates cries on “Sunshower.” Even if you invite friends to install their art behind your Tiny Desk Concert or distribute handmade zines when you open Blink-182's arena tour, the loneliness of fame still finds you.

On Never Enough, Crass' call to reclaim “beauty” and “truth” takes shape in Turnstile's mindful integration of electronic music to their punk roots. “Look Out for Me” shakes off the '80s radio rock for full-volume, mosh-worthy riffs; trades those for deep minimalist synth like solemn church organ; and proceeds to build into a Jamie xx–style slice of UK club. It's transcendent. “Dull” stutters, warps, and smashes fists into fretboards, pulling back like a bowstring before it succumbs to dial-tone clipping. Even “Time Is Happening,” an out-and-out pop-punk hit, pairs its sugar-high bliss with an ambient comedown. The album's two hardcore tracks, “Sunshower” and “Birds,” take different approaches. The former, a circle pit ripper, begins searing hot and ends with a soothing new-age meditation guided by Shabaka's flute, like a cold plunge after the sauna. On “Birds,” Fang's percussive tricks mount anticipation before Yates takes off screaming: “I found a song playing just for me/And now I'm free/No one left to be.”

Being yourself isn't always easy, even in a genre that preaches nonconformity. At least Turnstile make it look effortless. Yates long ago stopped abiding by outdated signifiers of masculinity; the sober frontman enjoys Shirley Temples at the pub, dances onstage more with his hips than his arms, and tenderly credits his older sister with getting him into music. “I want to thank you for letting me be myself,” he declared on Glow On, and meant it.

In Yates' eyes, hardcore is not defined by how it sounds, but by the community it builds. It's why Turnstile threw a free charity concert outdoors in Baltimore before Never Enough dropped, and why those new songs spawned endless stage divers despite, or because of, mellow synth passages. To be comfortable in your body and mind, especially in the presence of others, is a right that feels like a privilege. What greater sensation than being guided towards that acceptance through music? “Never enough” isn't a mantra for self-abasement or a premeditated retort to critics; it's permission to be imperfect while growing. LP4 was never going to be what everyone else wanted it to be. For Turnstile, that couldn't be more of a relief.

The first NBA YoungBoy tour in five years is three months away and it's already a circus. For one thing, Donald Trump got involved: In an effort to get dummies to forget everything else going on, he pardoned the influential Baton Rouge rapper, whose weapon charges had limited his travel. For another, EBK Jaaybo, one of the major openers on the lineup, was arrested on gun and drug charges in Arkansas and his name was scrubbed from ticket sites. The rumor mills are now debating whether he will appear or not. Jaaybo, like YoungBoy five years ago, is a rap phenom in his early 20s who has spent too much of his life institutionalized. He makes plain-spoken, brutal Stockton drill—a grief-stricken Northern California rap scene of the 2020s, where the bleakness of the music reflects the conditions of a small city screwed over by local politicians. Besides Kendrick Lamar, he is arguably the hottest rapper in California right now, with popularity that's as much about the vivid music as the fetish for gangsta rap authenticity.

Jaaybo's new mixtape, Don't Trust Me, comes on the heels of a singles run—“F*ck Everybody (Free Maxx),” “The Biggest G,” “Homebody,” none of which are on the tape—as obsessed with revenge as a Charles Bronson flick. Don't Trust Me blows up the hushed menace of the late Young Slo-Be into blunt diss records full of spooky Skrilla-core choirs, hyphy drums, and bloodshed, all turned up to the speaker-crunching max. It's visceral and bone-chilling music that makes Stockton sound like a gladiator match. “I fucked it up in the north, them niggas brunts, I could name a few victims/I told the bitch that trollin' gang would catch up to him, he ain't listen,” he raps on the miliant intro “Suicidal.” On the EBK posse cut “Top Rank Gz,” he says, “Embarrassed that his homie died a bitch so he didn't post him,” with a mean flow that recalls DB tha General's 2010s take on Bay Area mobb music.

There's hardly a lyric that isn't about death. That may seem like the norm for drill, but the way Jaaybo drags out the final syllable of nearly every line forces you to sit with the stomach-turning realities of the genre's stories: Kids getting caught in the crossfire on “It'll Happen to You,” an enemy pimping minors on “Exposing Me,” the casual homophobia of “Stand Over Music.” It's not so noticeable when you listen to it one song at a time, like many will, but when you run through 21 straight tracks of neighborhood war and destruction, it feels almost as voyeuristic as watching fanmade street politics documentaries on YouTube. In fact, Jaaybo's songs include so many name drops and searchable references that it appears as if the music is drafting off the popularity of beef content. It's missing imagination; it's missing style. He doesn't have Drakeo the Ruler's inventive flows or YoungBoy's hardened melodies, the stylistic elements that make those rappers' best tapes feel like they're not just about death, but the feeling of being surrounded by death.

Jaaybo's closest parallel is probably King Von, the Chicago drill star who grew immensely popular off his beef-centric storytelling, and who died in 2020 in a shooting outside a nightclub. The way Von's alleged street life was ingrained in his scenic writing—there's a YouTube documentary the length of The Godfather Part II on the subject with over 16 million views—was unnerving. The two rappers' catalogs present a similar contradiction: The directness that can be interpreted as street-life porn is also what makes the music so evocative. You feel the life-or-death intensity when you listen to one of Jaaybo's battle cries, especially when the beats are as cranked up as the laser beam parade on “Run That Bag to Me” or the dystopian clipping drums of “Tribe K.”

To Jaaybo's credit, there's an undercurrent of paranoia, desperation, and self-reflection that pushes the tape beyond violence and into a moral conflict of survival. He mentions getting through that inner struggle by numbing the pain with pills on “Run That Bag to Me” and holding on to tears since his teenage years on “Get Back Gang.” Even on the confessional “Triple Cross,” he admits, “Throwbacks of me and bro I can't believe my nigga gone/Did so many skits I ain't surprised she did a nigga wrong/'Cause you gon' reap what you sow/Karma knockin' at my door,” with a naked honesty that is moving.

But Don't Trust Me is often as striking as it is uncomfortable. That paradox is amplified by the millions of streams the tape is going to pile up in a hip-hop ecosystem whose loudest and most powerful voices are self-serving grifters like DJ Akademiks and Joe Budden. EBK Jaaybo isn't just another drill flavor of the month; he is one of the most popular street rappers of the moment, a performer who may end up as a marquee name on a tour so big that the president heard about it. He gets bigger every time he goes to jail, every time the beef escalates. It's about way more than just the songs, which increasingly is the reality of rap right now. It's the rawest of the raw music going into a culture that doesn't have the checks and balances to handle it anymore.

Daron Malakian has strong opinions about what's missing in heavy music today: danger and risk. “I think you have a generation of fans who are very easily offended,” he tells Rolling Stone. “Offensiveness and shock should not be taken away from rock music in general.”


	Those qualities are inherent in “Killing Spree,” the bloodthirsty first single off Addicted to the Violence, the new album from Daron Malakian and Scars on Broadway, due out July 18. “Insanity/Controlling me,” he sings in the song's chorus, “Society/The kids are on a killing spree.” Built on manic, strobing guitars and undulating waves of distortion, the music feels both cutting and brutalizing. “It's gonna feel like a Jesus comin' back,” he sings, stretching the last word heavenward with giddy, helium-like aplomb. “It's gonna feel like the devil's on the attack.”


	“I think the song ‘Killing Spree' is a subject that I don't think a lot of people want to touch,” Malakian, 49, says via email. “I don't care, I'll touch it because it exists. It's not to be shocking or offensive, but it exists, and that's what I'll write about if I want to. I'm not going to edit myself if someone is going to be offended. I think that's missing in heavy metal music.”

	











	He's reluctant to explain the song — “Your kids are on a killing spree, so your kids have something to do with it,” he says vaguely — partially because he doesn't see anything controversial about the subject matter of killing sprees. “We live in a world, and things happen in this world, and killing sprees are one of those things that I've seen happen kind of often in the last 15 years or so — but I actually wrote the song way before that,” he says. Moreover, he looks at the song as commentary more than a transgressive statement. “It's not for or against anything,” he says. “It just is.”

	











	These days, Malakian says he just writes songs for the sake of it. As guitarist-singer for System of a Down, he's been keeping busy touring with them. Since that band has reached a creative stalemate, at least when it comes to making a new album (they did record a couple of songs a few years ago), he has been slowly working on a follow-up to the last Scars on Broadway album, Dictator, which came out in 2018. That album contained songs he had once hoped to record with System of a Down; Addicted to the Violence, he says, is more general.

	“At this point in my life, I don't write any songs for System or for Scars,” he says. “I just write songs. I think if System was making an album, some of those songs would probably end up on a System album, but System does not make albums these days, so they go to Scars.”


	Malakian had recorded Dictator as a distraction from “some personal things going on with my family and my life,” so he recorded a bunch of songs in the space of two weeks, doing everything himself, from the vocals and guitars to the drums. Addicted to the Violence has been a more considered affair that found him collaborating on songwriting with his friend, multi-instrumentalist Orbel Babayan, drummer Roman Lomtadze, and saxophonist Matthew “Narducci” Silberman.


	“This album probably took me longer than any album I've ever made to decide it was done,” Malakian says. “On this one, I did more home demos, recorded some stuff at home, picked the songs in my rolodex of songs that were like, ‘Let's record this one, see how it goes.'”

	Scars on Broadway first recorded the songs at Malakian's home, but it didn't sound right, so they went to a studio, recutting everything but the vocals. He estimates it took close to two years to get everything the way he wanted it. “I was in no rush,” he says. “I'm never in any rush. I'm sure people who like what I do realize I don't put out an album every year. … That's just my process.”


	So will people be able to hear these songs in a concert setting? “I have plans to play live, but I don't have any tours scheduled or anything like that,” he says. “But I definitely have plans to play live.”

	In 1932, veterans pitched tents along the Anacostia River. In sweltering summer heat, tens of thousands of World War I veterans and their families formed a protest encampment in Washington, D.C. They called themselves the Bonus Army, and they came with one message: America must honor its promises to those who served.


	That chapter in history is often forgotten, but it's being written again — this time not with tents, but with job cuts, broken benefits, and a full-frontal assault on the very federal agencies meant to serve and who employ those who've borne the battle.


	On June 6 — D-Day — thousands will rally across the country to protest these cuts. With the largest rally taking place at the steps of the Capitol. 


	Veterans make up nearly 30 percent of the federal workforce. They serve in every agency, from Homeland Security to HUD. And now, many are facing the same fate: a pink slip, a hostile workplace, and a lie from Donald Trump and Elon Musk about how they need to find work elsewhere. Not a voice from the Republican Party is protesting this disgusting and false narrative. 

	











	Trump's so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), formerly led by billionaire Musk, with enforcers like Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins, will gut over 15 percent of the VA's workforce — some 83,000 people, many of them disabled veterans. Those to be fired will include mental health counselors, suicide prevention specialists, LGBTQ+ outreach coordinators, and public health professionals. These are not bureaucrats on Fox News complaining about their 12-hour work days like Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino. They are hardworking professionals who go to bat every day to ensure our veterans live to see another day. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Veterans know the layoffs aren't about saving money. They're about weakening the institution and ultimately privatizing and gutting VA disability funding, as spelled out in Project 2025. Internal documents show plans to merge offices dedicated to homelessness, suicide prevention, women's health, and toxic exposure into “generalized” departments — removing hard-earned expertise and scrapping programs that have saved lives.

	And for the veterans who will still work in these buildings? They're being squeezed. Literally. With tens of thousands of remote federal workers being forced back into buildings without enough workstations, some VA hospital employees are working out of closets. The goal from the Trump administration is to make work so untenable at the VA, that people quit. Again, radio silence from GOP leaders on this. 


	Veterans know that Trump is gutting research grants for colleges who serve veterans and do research that saves and improves their lives. Columbia University's Resilience Center for Veterans & Families, which offers trauma-informed care and clinician training, is on the chopping block. Harvard's VA-affiliated research programs on cancer, suicide prevention, and toxic exposure were abruptly defunded by Trump. No explanation. No plan to replace it. 


	Black, Latino, gay, women, and other veterans are being purged from Department of Defense websites and programs. 


	Trump just reinstated his ban on transgender service members, with backing from his Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Rep. Barry Moore (R-Ala.), who introduced a bill to codify it permanently. This is not about “readiness.” It's about hate.


	Trans Americans have served honorably in every branch. They fly missions. They lead teams. But under Trump's second administration, they are no longer good enough.

	Thousands now face medical screenings and purges, even as our military faces a historic recruiting crisis. This purge will drive talented linguists, medics, mechanics, and pilots out of the ranks — making our military weaker, not stronger.


	Trump's executive order “Remaking the Federal Workforce” has already cost thousands of federal employees their jobs and will disenfranchise and bankrupt many more. Veterans know all of this, and now they are standing up. 


	We are standing up because we see the writing on the wall. Trump wants to privatize the VA, handing over veterans' care to the same corporations that put profits over people. The goal? Sabotage the VA so it can be sold off to the highest bidder — Trump donors and corporate allies eager to profit from veterans' pain.

	











	Veterans are more than a political talking point. We are not pawns in a culture war. We are patriots — Black, white, Latino, Asian, Native, gay, straight, trans, and everything in between. Our strength is in our diversity. Our sacrifice is our credential. Our unity will be on full display on Friday. 


	Trump's betrayal of the veterans community is unforgivable. But it is not unanswerable.

Livvy Dunne knows that she's not what people typically think of when they imagine a world-famous athlete. 


	The 22-year-old gymnast, whose legal name is Olivia Paige Dunne, grew a social media platform 8 million followers deep on TikTok — posting videos of her life, routine, and experiences as a gymnast at Louisiana State University. (In 2023, Dunne was featured on Rolling Stone's Creator List). The athlete, who was recently a cover star for the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, was part of the LSU gymnastic team that took home the 2024 Collegiate National Championship — the first in the school's history. But her presence on the national stage continues to grow, even as she announced her retirement from the sport in April 2025. Now no longer on the uneven bars, Dunne tells Rolling Stone that she's excited to see how she can spend her time post-college still advocating for women in sports. 


	“I'll always advocate for women's sports — they're so important,' she says. “I have a fund at LSU called the Livvy Fund, and it's to help provide NIL [name, image, likeness] deals for female student athletes. I'd like to expand that to other schools and keep helping women and educating them because it is harder for women to get NIL deals and to know what to do. Because there's not a lot of knowledge or opportunity in that area. That's so important to me.”

	In May, Dunne opened Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit Runway Show during Miami, Florida's Swim Week alongside athletes like Jordan Chiles and Ilona Maher. It was Dunne's first runway show, and even though she was nervous, she decided to fully lean into the performance — dropping down into a split at the end of the runway. 

	











	“I was so nervous that during rehearsal I walked down the wrong side of the runway,” Dunne says, laughing. “But whenever I get nervous, I just take a deep breath and smile, because that makes me feel my best. I actually had my Invisalign aligners in and then I went on the runway, had all the confidence in the world and dropped into a split. Because why not? Gymnastics will never leave me. I'll always be a gymnast at heart.”

	One of the things that Dunne feels even more passionate about is using her platform to call out bad behavior and harassment that female athletes often experience once they reach a certain level of fame. While fans were celebrating Dunne on the cover of Sports Illustrated, she posted that she was getting harassed by groups of middle aged men who would figure out her flight information and stalk her while she was in airports, following and yelling at her for an autograph. The experience has been echoed by other female sports stars, including Gabby Thomas, an Olympic gold-medalist for track and field. 


	“There's a line and it was being crossed. I mean, I love signing autographs for people. I never have a problem. But it's when somebody knows where you're going to be before you,” she says. “Sometimes they'll buy tickets to get through security to wait. It's a little uncomfortable for a female traveling alone, and a little creepy. So I think me speaking out about it and bringing it to light again was important because it was a bit out of hand.”

	And now that she's hung up her leotard, what's next? Dunne will continue to be an influencer, picking up deals with companies like Invisalign, while also helping fellow female athletes trying to grow in their sport and also take control of their own social media presences. 


	“My favorite thing about social media is the friendships that I've made,” she tells Rolling Stone. “Meeting other people that have the same passion as you and a similar drive is so fun. And the way that you can connect with people in different parts of the country, that's so special. It's changed my life.”

Donald Trump and Elon Musk's bromance appears to be over after the president and the world's richest man went after each other with a vengeance on Thursday. Trump implied Musk's opposition to his legislative agenda is the result of Trump Derangement Syndrome, called the Tesla billionaire “CRAZY,” and threatened to cancel Musk's federal contracts. Musk called Trump “sad,” alleged the president is on the Epstein list, and even suggested he should be impeached.


	It's one of the wildest political breakups in recent memory, and, yes, the media, the internet, and everyone in and around Washington, D.C., is losing their mind over the spat, popcorn in hand.


	Trump has seemed relatively nonplussed about the ordeal (“I don't mind Elon turning against me,” he wrote on Truth Social), while Musk has been all over the place. The SpaceX chief wrote that the company will “begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately, but then backtracked after a random X account suggested he “cool off” and “step back.” Bill Ackman, one of the right-leaning tech moguls caught in the middle of the feud, wrote that Trump and Musk should “make peace for the benefit of our great country,” to which Musk replied, “You're not wrong.” Musk has since called Steve Bannon a “retard” several times as the staunch Trump ally calls for the administration to seize SpaceX and investigate Musk's immigration status.

	The White House is trying to broker a truce between the two men, according to Politico, but Maggie Haberman of The New York Times has reported that the administration is prepared to force allies of both men to choose sides in the spat. Trump told CNN on Friday morning that he's “not even thinking” about Musk, that the “poor guy” has “a problem,” and that he “won't be speaking to him for a while.” White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles told NBC News on Friday that there “are no plans for a call today,” with a senior White House official adding that Trump is “not interested” in talking to Musk.

	The feud was a bomb in the middle of the right-wing ecosystem, with some commentators taking sides and others straining themselves to rationalize the falling out between two figures they have spent the past months lionizing.


	“Some of y'all cant handle 2 high agency males going at it and it really shows,” conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec wrote on X. “This is direct communication (phallocentric) vs indirect communication (gynocentric). I understand you aren't used to it.” Robby Starbuck, another MAGA commentator, wrote that it “doesn't have to be over” for Trump and Musk, and that “dominant men often develop deep friction when they disagree.” He then compared them to Thomas Jefferson and John Adams and said he hopes Trump and Musk reconcile “for the betterment of humanity.” So did Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. “President Trump built this movement over 10 years. His supporters are NOT going anywhere,” he wrote. “I hope Elon and Trump reconcile and do so privately. It would be good for the country and the world if they do.”


	Ashley St. Clair, the MAGA influencer and allegedly jilted mother of one of Musk's children, knows a split when she sees one, though. “hey @realDonaldTrump lmk if u need any breakup advice,” she wrote.


	The post that struck the deepest nerve among the right may have been Musk's claim that Trump is mentioned in government files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Several MAGA commentators dismissed the allegation, noting that if this were true the Biden administration would have made sure everyone knew it. Sean Hannity spent a few minutes on the air working through his emotions on the feud, including by claiming that Trump was “one of the first people to realize just how horrible Epstein really was” before suggesting Bill Clinton may be on the list.

	InfoWars founder Alex Jones was not convinced, calling for Trump to respond to the allegation immediately. “What a POS Alex Jones turned out to be — what a fucking fraud,” wrote MAGA influencer @catturd2. “I used to respect Alex Jones but now he's just a piece of shit fraud. What a fucking sellout.”


	“I am not on team Trump or team Elon. I am on team humanity, which equals team truth,” Jones, who was found liable for nearly $1 billion in damages for lying about the Sandy Hook massacre, wrote later.


	Pro-Trump voices like @catturd2 and pro-Musk commentators like Ian Miles Cheong — who wrote that Trump “wishes he was Elon” — have been sparring nonstop on X since the feud exploded Thursday afternoon, but there are also plenty of real-world implications for the apparent breakup, which Laura Ingraham of Fox News reported was “irreparable.”

	The Senate is set to take up the “big, beautiful” tax bill that set off the feud, and many Republican lawmakers have nodded to Musk's arguments about the trillion it is expected to add to the deficit. There's also the very real possibility that Trump could punish Musk, either by revoking his federal contracts or reviving federal probes into his companies. As one senior Trump appointee told Rolling Stone on Thursday: “THIS ADMINISTRATION COULD ALWAYS START THE INVESTIGATIONS AGAIN.”


	It's unclear for now how Trump will respond, but he certainly has the power to make things difficult for his former billionaire BFF, and — as he always does — to further inflame the already red-hot media firestorm he and Musk set off on Thursday.

	There's something special about a game of Mario Kart. Even with 30-plus years of iteration, the basic conceit hasn't changed much, and doesn't need to. Whether it's piled up on the bedroom floor in front of an old tube TV or, now, live chatting via an in-game Zoom, the joy of go-cart racing with friends remains timeless.


	But when it comes to Nintendo, there's a distinct knack for changing things just enough to twist well-worn territory into new. And while their newest console, Switch 2, isn't exactly their most ambitious, its flagship title certainly is. With Mario Kart World (out now), Nintendo aims to deliver on ideas the developers have been holding onto for a while, creating a game that's bigger and more chaotic than ever before, without skimping on the little details that give the brand its spirit.


	And while it'd be easy for more cynical folks to write it off as a tweaked take on more of the same, or a side quest rather than a much-needed killer app for a new console launch, Mario Kart World personifies everything that's great about Nintendo. It's a game of tight systems, belied depth, and endless whimsy that's going to have some staying power. It might even be the best one yet.

	











	From the start, the most obvious addition to the old Mario Kart formula comes from the game's name: its large-scale interconnected world. Historically, Mario Kart sees players select a handful of courses to run through in a cup prix, and that remains true in the new one for most modes, but now each level has been overlayed on top of a fully explorable world map. In Free Roam, which is instantly accessible from the main menu (although corralled off from the main menu as though it's a separate, more esoteric experience), players can take control of any of the game's few dozen racers and begin tearing up the terrain.

	











	It feels strange at first; going off course feels antithetical to the strict route Mario Kart normally requires. After cutting the wheel and taking to the backroads and hillsides, players will find that there's plenty to discover. Each of the game's different courses are fully available to drive through at pace to peep for collectibles (there's hundreds) and alternate paths to remember later in races. There's also P-switches to hit (again, hundreds) that kick off short, timed missions like collecting coins and dodging enemies that help hone skills and further familiarize people with the world.

	The world itself is lively, if not exactly dense. NPC passenger cars zoom around without causing a threat and there's no repercussions for running into other vehicles or even other people (Grand Theft Auto, this ain't). Seasoned players of open world games might find the free roam zone lacking, but the scattered missions string together nicely, one often flowing into the next as players are left with one or more switches just on the horizon after completing a trial. It's easy to get sucked into a string of missions organically, before getting distracted by a new costume icon, Peach medal, or secret lever to chase.


	The interconnected regions adhere to Nintendo's design philosophy that dates to Super Mario Bros. 3 and, especially, Super Mario World for the SNES, where every area has its own stock geography (snowy zones, desert areas, volcanoes, etc.), and each house about four racetracks that stick to the theme. In Grand Prix, selecting a four-race cup essentially designates a region to race through, all with an environmental throughline. Even when you're not going off alone on the open road, the world feels woven into just about every aspect of the game.

	Outside of Free Roam, Mario Kart World offers up all the well-known modes that are staples of the franchise. Grand Prix is a series of four races that can be played at one of three difficulties (with increasing speed), although the individual cups having themes means that they feel more cohesive than before. Choosing the Flower Cup, for instance, will weave together a route that begins in the desert (Desert Hills) and leads into an equally sandy Shy Guy Bazaar, then to the monster-truck-rally-esque Wario Stadium before finishing in the sky bound Airship Fortress.

	











	It's not a hard and fast rule — some tracks still pop in with a surprising change of scenery — but the curation feels good; it's less of a random assortment of races and more of an A to D journey each time.


	The journey element plays especially well in Knockout Tour, the game's take on battle royale racing. In this mode, 24 players must race through a chosen rally of four to six levels that are fully interconnected. Whereas Grand Prix stops down to show the results in between bouts, Knockout Tour is one extended cross-country death race where competitors keep driving in between tracks with just a little breather before the action picks back up.


	For players who love the stress of a nail-biting Mario Kart experience, Knockout Tour is the pinnacle of the concept. As a battle royale, each race requires players to place in a high position, with anyone below the cut off losing entirely and knocked out of the match. While Mario Kart has always shined when friends are throttling each other for first, the heightened stakes of knowing one wrong move can end the run completely makes the experience much sweatier. Winning the cup after defying death over the course of a full 20-minute sessions evokes the thrills of games like Fortnite at their peak, amplified by the lack of breaks. If you're the friend who tends to scream their way through an evening with Mario Kart, this mode will run your throat raw.


	Other than dedicated group races, there are solo Time Trials and VS Race, with the latter available in both single-player and multiplayer. In VS, custom rules can be implemented like specific item types, and a route of courses can be chosen at will. There's also Battle modes like Coin Runners and Balloon Battle, which tend to be the favorite for people who can never seem to get a leg up on actual races. With 24-players (up from 12), the battle courses are expanded in size but always end up being frenetic.


	While there's plenty to do, perhaps the best aspect of Mario Kart World is all the little details to see. With 50 characters (up from the last game's 42), including the obvious choices like Mario, Luigi, and Peach, the game's roster now includes tons of ridiculous inclusions from the lore of Mario games — including some deep cuts. Players can now choose former NPCs like Mario 64's penguin and Sidestepper (who's just a tiny crab), all of whom are brimming with personality.

	











	In 2025, lively character animations shouldn't be that impressive, but from the driver select screen to mid-race gameplay, each of the racers exude an infectious charisma. Flipping through before a race, it's easy to get caught up watching the towering Wiggler do a Carlton-like dance or Monty Mole rhythmically slapping his belly as it jiggles. Little details like this make Mario Kart World feel modern in a subtle way even when the graphics aren't exactly cutting edge. Nintendo is wise enough to know that showcasing the power on its new console doesn't just boil down to lifelike facsimiles or breaching the uncanny valley; it's best suited to making everything even more fantastical.


	The level of detail plays heavily into how Mario Kart World actually works, too. With increased horsepower comes more complex physics and capabilities in-game. While older games in the series relied heavily on memorizing courses and perpetually driving with precision around every bend, there's now a lot more ways to play catch up and get ahead.


	Like in Mario Kart 8, executing a taunt (with the drift button) at the apex of a ramp will let players get a little speed boost. But now, with the inclusion of the Charge Jump (using the same button on straightaways), it's possible to jump onto rails and powerlines to grind or along walls for a sideways ride. Grinding on railroad tracks offers a speed boost and can be reupped by performing the taunt. But little opportunities arise everywhere; heavy waves in water can propel racers just enough to warrant a boost push and can strung together by smart player to blast through areas that otherwise might've slowed them down.

	Tracks have been sized up to accommodate more racers, but it also leads to open areas where there's so much going on, you might not even know what's happening in the periphery. Small pockets of micro-incursions can break out in open fields of dust storms where a few players are battling it out while you're on your merry way grinding on the far edge of the lane. It all adds to the feeling that every race has more emergent elements, even when so many of the obstacles are scripted. How 24 people react in real time is what keeps every competition interesting.


	It would've been easy for Nintendo to make a Mario Kart 9 that stuck to its more linear roots, but by leaning into what works best and turning up of the knob on the things people love most — the accessibility, charm, and chaos — Mario Kart World ends up being a peak for a classic franchise. This is a game that will be dominating time on rec room TV or backseat car rides for years to come.

Donald Trump's top campaign firm has quietly handled the administration's television advertisements thanking the president for closing the border and locking up criminals, according to a Rolling Stone review.


	Strategic Media Services Inc. does not appear in any publicly available records regarding the Department of Homeland Security's controversial $200 million ad campaign. However, the ad buying firm — which was the single-biggest vendor for Trump's 2024 campaign — is the only company that's been associated with DHS' ads in filings with the Federal Communications Commission since the department announced the ads in February.  


	A DHS spokesperson denies knowing anything about Strategic Media Services, and says the firm isn't one of the department's vendors. “DHS doesn't have control of subcontractors and cannot tell a vendor who or who not to hire,” they add. Strategic Media Services did not respond to outreach from Rolling Stone.


	The Trump administration has faced scrutiny over its profligate, political-style ad campaign, in which Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem repeatedly thanks the president while attempting to scare immigrants into leaving the United States or never coming here at all. The ad campaign is one of many ways that Trump and his administration are marshaling vast public resources to make the president feel good about himself.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In one set of ads, Noem thanks Trump for “securing our border and putting America first,” while telling undocumented immigrants: “We will find you and deport you.” In another, she credits “President Trump's leadership” for her Department of Homeland Security having caught several people accused of heinous crimes.

	











	A Trump White House official says that “it is normal for an agency head to thank their principal — in this instance the president of the United States — for their policies and leadership.”


	While Trump has purged the federal workforce and slashed government programs in the name of eliminating waste and abuse, his administration determined there to be such “an unusual and compelling urgency” for this $200 million ad campaign that officials selected two Republican firms to work on the ads without a competitive bidding process.

	One of the firms, called People Who Think, has ties to former top Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski, a longtime Noem confidant who is reportedly acting as her “gatekeeper” at DHS. (They have both denied reports that they had an affair.) The second vendor, Safe America Media, is a newly created shell company operating at the home of GOP consultant Mike McElwain. 


Rolling Stone attempted to call McElwain for this story, but the man who picked up immediately hung up the phone and did not respond to texts. People Who Think did not respond to a request for comment. 


	Officials specifically exempted the DHS ads from review by Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency. The DHS briefly attempted to fund these ads with money from its Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, an oversight office the administration has tried to gut, but backtracked after Rolling Stone reported on the maneuver. 


	The involvement of Strategic Media Services, the Trump campaign's ad buyer, has not been disclosed in government procurement files or spending data.


	Trump's campaign committee disclosed paying $270 million to Strategic Media Services during the 2024 election — or more than half of what the campaign raised, according to federal election records. Most of the spending went toward ad placements.

	Dozens of FCC records show the firm buying TV time for DHS ads in recent months. The firm's buys can be traced to a 30-second version of the ad in which Noem starts: “Thank you, President Donald J. Trump, for securing our border and putting America first.” 


	Strategic Media Services also apparently placed an ad in which Noem says: “An accused rapist, murderer and child pornographer. All illegal aliens caught because of President Trump's leadership.” Noem pledges in that ad that “if you're here illegally, you will be fined nearly $1,000 a day, imprisoned, and deported,” as video plays showing her touring CECOT — the notorious mega-prison in El Salvador where Trump shipped hundreds of immigrants without due process, in open defiance of a judge's order. 

	











	After encouraging immigrants to self-deport, Noem concludes: “Under President Trump, America will be protected.”


	So far, DHS has disclosed spending roughly $77 million on the ads, federal records show. 


	Tony Carrk, executive director at the watchdog Accountable.US, tells Rolling Stone, “President Trump and his allies in Congress say they have no choice but to rip away health care and basic food aid from millions of working people and seniors. Yet there's somehow plenty of money for more Trump tax breaks for his billionaire donors and for an overtly political taxpayer-funded vanity project to repair Kristi Noem's image after her many scandals. That's the Trump administration in a nutshell: There's always enough taxpayer money to promote their brands or enrich themselves and wealthy insiders — but no money left to help everyday Americans get ahead.”

	In a budget hearing in May, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) pressed Noem on the way her department is using the public's money, including her spending “$200 million for an ad campaign fawning over President Trump's supposed accomplishments.”


	“You're just spending recklessly and it would seem wastefully, without authorization,” Blumenthal said. “That's against the law.”

Dylan Thuras: It was 1988, and all year, Jim Weiner had been having a terrible time sleeping. He was having nightmares, but these were not normal nightmares, because Jim said he felt like he was awake, almost like it was some kind of sleep paralysis.

He'd wake up to the overwhelming sense that there was someone in the room with him. He'd hear a flurry of voices, but he couldn't understand them. He couldn't move anything but his eyes. And often, his twin brother Jack was there, along with two college friends, Chuck and Charlie.

Jim would be lying on this table in a bright white room. At first, Jim thought he knew what was causing this strange, awful sensation. Years earlier, he'd been in a bad accident. He'd injured his spine and his brainstem. He told his psychiatrist, it seems like things were under control.

They were going to get better. But then Jim got on the phone with his brother Jack, and they made a very unnerving discovery.

This was happening to Jack too. The bright white room, the table, Charlie and Chuck, the paralysis. Jack said he was seeing the same things. And as they dug deeper, the brothers would trace this strange sensation to an incident that happened more than a decade earlier, in the north woods of Maine, in the Allagash Wilderness Waterway.

I'm Dylan Thuras, and this is Atlas Obscura. And today, we are talking UFOs. We are talking alien abductions. And we're doing it National Parks style.

This is an edited transcript of the Atlas Obscura Podcast: a celebration of the world's strange, incredible, and wondrous places. Find the show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major podcast apps.

Dylan: National Parks are pretty much universally beloved. You have to be, like, a pretty unpleasant person to really dislike National Parks. But there's also this other side to these enormous wild places. People die or disappear in National Parks actually pretty frequently. I don't say this to discourage anyone from visiting the parks. Millions and millions of people go there. They are wonderful. They are safe. They are amazing. But they are big and they are wild. And there's a hidden side to everything, including these places that we revere. So I am here today with two people who know more about the dark and sinister side of National Parks than I would guess almost anyone else. Danielle LaRock and Cassie Yahnian are hosts of the podcast National Park After Dark, a podcast for the morbid outdoor enthusiast, which is not a thing that I knew I was until I heard your work. So, Danielle, Cassie, thanks for coming on the show.

Danielle LaRock: Thank you so much for the lovely introduction.

Cassie Yahnian: Yes. We're excited to be here.

Dylan: It's great. Meeting of the morbid outdoor enthusiasts. Yeah, so where are you two right now in the world? You look like you are in nice places.

Danielle: I'm in Maine.

Dylan: Oh, great.

Cassie: Yeah, and I'm in Vermont.

Dylan: Oh, nice. Yeah, this is great. I went to college in Bennington.

Cassie: Oh, very cool. Bennington's a very cool area.

Dylan: Yeah. It's also actually a place where there's like all these weird, mysterious disappearances. The like, little Bennington Triangle. It's like a whole—we could do a whole other thing.

Danielle: There's some vibes happening.

Dylan: There's some vibes. There are some vibes in that Bennington Triangle. And we're going to get back to Jack and Jim's story in just a second. But to further set the mood, why don't you give me a quick lightning round of a few of your favorite morbid stories that have taken place in national parks. Danielle, go.

Danielle: Okay. Everglades National Park. In the 1800s, bird populations were being decimated for fashion and one of the first men who tried to save them was killed for it.

Cassie: Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park. A backcountry ranger went missing while out on patrol and then the largest search operation ever recorded in those parks uncovered a complicated marriage, a mistress, and reasons he may have wanted to disappear.

Danielle: Joshua Tree National Park. Graham Parsons' friends wanted him to go out like he lived: as a rock star. After his untimely end, they stole his body from a plane, loaded it into a friend's hearse, drove it into Joshua Tree, and attempted a makeshift cremation.

Dylan: It makes me think the cremation went poorly.

Cassie: It did.

Dylan: That's a lot of, like, death, murder, mayhem in national parks. It just makes me feel like people, I don't know, maybe there's just something about national parks where people feel like they can get away with things. So, okay, let's talk about one of these cases. Let's get back to our brothers, Jim and Jack. And this story takes place in the Allagash Wilderness, which is technically not a national park, but an enormous state park in Maine. More than a decade before the brothers are having these strange visions, back in 1976, Jack and Jim are in their 20s. And what's going on with them? What sort of precipitates all of this stuff that happens later?

Danielle: Yeah, so you set the scene so brilliantly, so let's pick up from there. In August of 1976, the twins, Jim and Jack, along with Charlie Foltz and Chuck Rak, were in the midst of a two-week camping trip and fishing trip along the Allagash Waterway. The area, like you said, is part of the National Wild and Scenic River System. For anyone who has not been to Maine or Northern Maine, it's absolutely beautiful. It's super remote, and this area in particular is about 93 miles long worth of ribbons of lakes and streams, and it's just so beautiful. And the four of them had prepared for this trip for nearly a year beforehand, prepping, researching, getting ready to go. So at this point in time, they're dropped off in the wilderness by a bush plane, and they began their journey.

Dylan: And you said they got dropped off by a plane. So, I mean, they're, like, totally alone out there. It's, like, not the place you would bump into a random stranger. They seem quite far out in the wilderness.

Danielle: You can't just drive or walk up to a place like this. You need to intentionally seek it out. There's a few other campers around, moreso people that are doing a similar thing, right? So, canoers and paddlers—actually, this day, they run into another group of campers on a lake that they are also planning to camp on. And they had lost—one of the teenagers in their group had gotten separated and hadn't come back to their campsite yet. So, they actually offered to search for him. And this is when kind of the prelude happens to the encounter. And they're picking up binoculars, they're scanning this lake for the teenager. That's when the entire group all initially spot something strange that they, at first, just kind of write off as, ah, that's a weird, strange light in the sky.

Dylan: What do they see?

Danielle: So, when they're scanning the tree line, they're looking through binoculars. All of these people see this bright light, and it was in the eastern part of the sky, and it was moving slightly. And at first, they collectively thought they were maybe looking at Mars because it had this reddish tint to it. But suddenly, they all kind of look at each other like, this is weird. Because not only did everyone notice it, it was astoundingly bright. It seemed to be hovering about 200 feet from the top of the tree line. And then it all of a sudden, as they describe it, inverted on itself. So, it closed in kind of like an eyelid shutting, and then it blinked out from sight.

Dylan: That's not—that's slightly unnerving. Did they ever find the people they were looking for?

Danielle: Yes. The kid came back, and it was fine. And then they all went their separate ways and never saw each other again.

Dylan: Right. So, this sort of strange thing happens as they're looking for this lost camper, and they find the camper. Seems like that was not the end of things. What do they do after they have that first experience?

Cassie: So, later that evening, after settling into camp and making a large fire on the lake shore, the men decided that they wanted to go back onto the lake and do a night paddle. And that night was pretty eerie and quiet. They actually kind of noticed how dark it was and how quiet things were. And while Chuck was paddling, he suddenly felt like something was off, and he really felt like he could feel someone watching him. So, he threw his gaze over his shoulder, and he saw this ball of light rising from the trees about 200 yards away. Jim, Jack, and Charlie, they all turned around at this point to look, and a large round bright light was rising more above this tree line. It ascended roughly 300 feet, and then it hovered. It fluctuated between red, green, and yellow, and it wasn't solid, but rather had an almost liquid appearance to it.

Dylan: I would be pretty highly alarmed here if this is what was going on.

Danielle: So, after they all noticed this light rising up, they noticed a couple of things. First of all, it's way closer than whatever they saw hours prior. It is illuminating the entire forest, and it's dead silent. Chuck decides to lean down, grab his flashlight, points it at this source of light, and clicks the flashlight on and off in the universal, at least earthly, signal for SOS. And suddenly, this light source emits a light source of its own, kind of like a searchlight, and starts scanning the water, and it's moving in their direction. So, now, collectively, all the men are having this oh crap moment.

Dylan: Yeah, at this point.

Danielle: And start paddling like crazy back to their camp. So, they get back to the shoreline, but interestingly, there's a chunk of time that they can't recall, at least at first. So, they all remember seeing this light and turning to paddle back to shore, and then the next thing they remember is skidding up onto the shoreline to their campsite, where just 20 minutes prior, they had set a huge fire. And their fire is now smoldering, just smoldering coals. So, they clocked that as strange, and they kind of talked amongst each other for a brief minute about, huh, that was kind of weird, right? And then they all remember feeling like they were in this daze, and kind of equated it to after you come out of anesthesia, you're awake and you're conscious, but you're loopy and kind of scatterbrained. And they just went to sleep. The next day, they get up, they ran into a ranger, actually, and inquired if, you know, did you see anything like that? What was that?

Dylan: Yeah, what could that have been?

Danielle: Yeah. And he actually said, well, you know, there's a new hardware store out in Millinocket that had those, you know, those big Hollywood floodlights. And, you know, that is dozens of miles away. It does not match the description of what they encountered. So, they kind of said, oh, okay. Like, sure, that sounds like it. Thanks.

Dylan: Yeah, the local hardware store opening, you know, yeah, right.

Danielle: That must be it, right. But, yeah, so anyways, after that, they kind of dropped it, surprisingly. They continued their trip. They went on with their entire lives. They went back to school. They graduated. They had families. And like you said at the beginning, you know, decades go by. We're now in 1988 where this is starting to surface again.

Dylan: Okay, so we are back to where we started. Jim is having these crazy night visions. He talks to his brother, Jack. They realize that they're maybe experiencing the same thing. How does this all sort of start to connect for them? How do they start to realize that maybe there's something more to this past experience than what they initially thought?

Cassie: Well, then they ended up contacting Chuck and Charlie to speak about that night again, to be like, hey, are you experiencing any of this? Like, we're both having these weird dreams. Are you? And then it turned out that all of them were experiencing the same thing, and it was kind of that moment where they're like, wait, we forgot about this. We kind of pushed it to the side, but maybe there's something more here that we didn't realize.

Dylan: Yeah.

Danielle: And surprisingly, you know, you mentioned that Jim's physicians initially said, hey, we're going to recommend you for further help. And of all people, they recommend him to a ufologist. And that ufologist is the one that recommended they start doing some regression hypnotherapy. All four of the men agreed to do that. And separately, they start to uncover eerily similar experiences of lost memories from that evening.

Dylan: To quickly recap, Jim, Jack, Chuck, Charlie, they go on this trip in the 70s, they've got this crazy experience with these floating lights, they kind of lose time, which is like classic UFO stuff, you know, you're like, I was only gone for five minutes, what do you mean? And then a decade later, they end up talking to this alien researcher, they do this hypnotic regression therapy. And over the course of that two years, they all end up with this sort of picture, or they converge on this understanding, of what happened. So what do they end up saying happened during that key, like missing period?

Danielle: Yeah. So long story short: They all—after two years—they come to realize that under hypnosis, they were finding out the same things. Essentially, they all recalled being aboard a spacecraft, where they were all subjected to different medical examinations by some of these humanoid entities. They all described them as having large heads, dark eyes, slender bodies, they don't speak with words, but rather telepathically send messages to them. And that was what was coming up also in their dreams and starting to kind of surface that way.

Dylan: Right. Yeah, what you're describing sounds a lot like the visions that Jim described having 10 years later.

Danielle: Yeah. Now they're all under the impression of, wow, we were gone for hours. We thought it was minutes. And we were abducted by aliens and experimented on and placed back into our canoe and sent on our way.

Dylan: And they like, they ended up, you know, sort of becoming a little bit famous, right?

Danielle: Yeah. And to be clear, you know, there, at first they were very scared. They were—this was traumatic memories for them. This was not something they looked back on fondly. After this collective understanding of this is a shared experience, or at least that's what they were under the impression of, they come to this sort of solace that, you know, this happened and let's own it and let's start talking about it. And that's what they did. And for years, they went on different speaking circuits. They talk a lot at different UFO conferences.

Dylan: Yeah, right. They became known as the Allagash Four, this kind of like, you know, group of abductees who could just talk about this experience and kind of shared it. But then later, later, I think it's Charlie, was it Chuck or Charlie? Who came forward?

Danielle: Chuck. Chuck was the one.

Dylan: Okay. Yeah. Chuck came forward and said, basically, yeah, some of this is bullshit, or like, we made some of this up. Like, did he actually say it was a hoax or was he sort of just like walking back some of it?

Danielle: He walked back some of it. So, his stance was that the incident with the other campers and seeing that strange light was true.

Dylan: Yeah.

Danielle: And also their experience on the lake, just the four of them, was true. Where he started to go off on his own was saying that the abduction part was fabricated. But the other guys point to, yeah, well, the only reason he's saying that now after years of us going on Joan Rivers and doing different television programs and all of this and wanting to write books, and the only reason he's saying that is because we had a big falling out in our friendship.

Dylan: I mean, I have to ask the question, what do you two think? You guys spend a lot of time out, way out in the wilderness, you know, under the night sky. I mean, are you believers?

Cassie: It would be very unbelievable for me to think that we are the only planet with life on it. You know? I think that it is way more unrealistic to think that we are the only people or life forms that exist in the entire universe.

Dylan: What about you, Danielle?

Danielle: I co-sign all of that.

Dylan: Have you two ever seen anything truly weird and unexplainable on any of your adventures?

Danielle: I saw Starlink and thought it was UFOs.

Dylan: I know so many people who were convinced they were seeing an alien invasion, but were just 100 percent seeing Starlink. Like, what is that? That's funny. Yes. It's super interesting. I don't know what I think. Maybe I'm more of a skeptic than you two. I have some mixed feelings. It's clear that, like, for some of these kind of abductee cases, like, something is going on. People are having very intense and genuinely traumatic experiences. They are experiencing something real for them. And I can't help but note that when all this is happening, like the late 80s and the early 90s, this is an absolute alien craze, right? The X-Files has just started. All of this stuff is happening on TV about, like, Area 51. There's, like, nothing hotter than kind of, like, weird aliens. I think it's possible, you know, they're doing this hypnotic regression therapy. And one of the big critiques of this is that it can, like, implant memories. And the person who did this to them also, like, wrote a book about it, and I think probably did pretty well on that book. I honestly don't know. It seems likely that they saw something very strange, to which I have no explanation of.

Danielle: So now that we're all kind of coming around to the government being like, yeah, aliens are real, you know, that's not new.

Dylan: Or at least we don't know what any of this stuff is. Like, we can't tell you or we don't know.

Danielle: Right. We can't confirm nor deny. But you know, now, as time goes on, we're starting to accept that aliens might be real. Whether or not they're the gray aliens that we think of when we imagine an alien, or if they're something completely different, we're coming around to the thought that we aren't alone in the universe.

Dylan: Interesting. Yeah, I think one of the things I like about this story is just that, especially when you're out there in the wilderness at night on your own, whatever—sometimes I do these bike rides, these, like, late night bike rides that go, it's like a full moon ride, and we all go look at the full moon, it's really nice—and I'm riding through a really familiar trail, but I'm riding at night, my little flashlight is shining. And the whole thing just starts to take on this other terrifying kind of aspect. And I can't really explain it. It's not rational. But I just, I do think that sometimes we just have experiences that we cannot explain. And there's something about being in the woods at night that just evokes those kinds of experiences. And I almost don't feel like I need an explanation to understand that feeling of: something is happening that I can't quite explain. How has covering all this affected your relationship with national parks and wilderness areas? Does it ever freak you out? Do you, you know, at night, camping out somewhere far away, are you, like, flashing back to these stories? Or are you kind of like, this is what we live for?

Cassie: Sometimes. I mean, yeah, for sure. There are, I think, on the brighter side, sometimes these stories, I like to feel like I am more prepared and more knowledgeable. But on the other side, when I have extensively researched a grizzly bear mauling, I cannot help but worry when I'm sleeping outdoors in grizzly territory.

Dylan: Also, a grizzly is not—that's a reasonable thing to be afraid of in a national park. That's quite a practical, real thing to be like, yeah, don't attract the grizzly to the tent. Danielle, how about you?

Danielle: I definitely am way more aware of my surroundings, but I'm trying to adopt her mantra of whatever's happening outside of the tent is none of my business.

Dylan: Yeah, good. Whatever that weird sound was, don't worry about it.

Danielle: Right.

Dylan: That was Danielle LaRock and Cassie Yahnian. They are the hosts of a really delightful, sometimes terrifying podcast called National Park After Dark. It's basically kind of true crime survival adventure in national parks. And you can find it wherever you get your podcast. It is really delightful. Give it a listen.

This is the moment ghost hunters visiting caves in the Peak District captured ‘crying child ghosts' and ‘screams for help' on camera.

Ghost hunter Tony Ferguson, accompanied by fellow paranormal-enthusiasts Jon Brown and his friend, Simon, captured the chilling footage during a visit to the haunted Hidden Druids Caves. Stunned by what they filmed, the trio caught ghosts warning them to ‘get out.'

“We arrived at 9pm and by the time we had started we were already hearing things,"" said Tony. ""At first, we heard a pair of boots clunking behind us, before children's laughter and a woman telling us to get out.”

Tony captured the chilling moment the ghosts tried to communicate with his friend, John, during his lone vigil at the caves in Birchover, Matlock. According to Tony, ‘voices' can be heard again, telling John to ‘f*** off'.

Tony said: “It was too strange to be a coincidence. We were filming until about half 10 at night, and the cliffs are impossible to get to without climbing rocks. Why would a lone woman or man be there?”

Tony, 40, explained that he always had an affinity for the paranormal. He said: “It started when I was a small boy at my Grandad's house - I would always see a male figure in a suit. Being young my parents thought I didn't like visiting, but as I got older, they started talking about the house and how it was haunted. After that, I was hooked.”

Tony officially started Ghosthunting in 2016, supported by friends like John (Exploring the Afterlife) and Simon (GS Searching for Ghosts). Tony said: “I am quite sceptical but quite shocked by what I experienced. After I got home, I googled the history of the caves as I do not like to be influenced and sure enough - the place was known for ritualistic sacrifice.""

Tony concluded that the video was one of his most compelling yet. He said: “All three of us were silent on the way home. In cases like these I know your mind can play tricks on you, but there was something incredibly heavy about that spot.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Jared Padalecki's Favorite Supernatural Episode of All Time Includes 1 of the Best Real-Life Jokes","https://www.cbr.com/jared-padalecki-favorite-supernatural-episode/","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 06:25:00 GMT","

In Supernatural's fifteen seasons on the air, the horror fantasy delved into obscure monster lore, urban legends, religions, and more. Sam and Dean Winchester traversed the country several times, hunting for everything that went bump in the night. Through the drama, the scares, and the sibling angst, Supernatural never shied away from poking fun at itself.

The series perfected the meta episode, with its crowning achievement being ""The French Mistake."" In addition to being the most meta episode of the series, it's also one of the funniest and Jared Padalecki's favorite. The iconic episode features a hilarious real-life joke in the form of tweets by Misha Collins.

""The French Mistake"" opens with Balthazar showing up to give Sam and Dean a key before sending them to an alternate reality. Sam and Dean crash through the window in Bobby's house and end up on a film set, where they're the two lead actors on a TV show called Supernatural. The meta episode playfully takes shots at the cast and crew alike, featuring characters based on director Robert Singer, creator Eric Kripke, and showrunner at the time, Sera Gamble.

""The French Mistake""

February 25, 2011

9.6/10

Sam and Dean are thrust into the lives of their alter egos, Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, who apparently don't get along. As the boys delve deeper into the lives of their respective actors, they learn that Jared has an alpaca and a giant portrait of himself riding a horse, and that Jensen has an aquarium in his trailer and used to be in a soap opera. Then they discover J-Squared's wallets. Sam and Dean run up the actor's credit cards, buying the ingredients they needed for a spell.

Supernatural was never meant to go beyond five seasons, and fans still question whether the show should have ended earlier than season 15.  

The episode was hilarious, drawing comparisons to the gritty and dangerous world from which the brothers came with the frivolous and oftentimes absurd alternate reality. Whether it's watching Sam and Dean try to act, or seeing the crew discuss Sam and Dean attempting to kill an extra, to Eric Kripke walking straight into gunfire, and getting shot multiple times before going down, ""The French Mistake"" is easily one of the best and funniest episodes of Supernatural. It's no wonder it's not just Jared Padalecki's favorite episode, but also Misha Collins and Eric Kripke's.

Part of the masterpiece that is ""The French Mistake"" is the fictionalized Misha Collins. He's a bit of a dope and a bit of a jerk. Sam and Dean first run into their co-star Misha, mistaking him for Cas. They ask about the key from Balthazar and ""Castiel"" responds accordingly, but when Sam and Dean ask about the ""TV crap,"" Misha breaks character. Sam and Dean angrily take the key back and storm off, taking digs at the names Misha and Jensen. As they walk away, Misha calls after them, thinking it is all a joke. He then tweets about the encounter, and Misha Collins amped up the meta-ness of the episode by actually tweeting Fake-Misha's post the night the episode aired.

Like the Winchesters, Castiel has also died a few times in Supernatural, only to be brought back every time for some higher purpose. 

When Sam and Dean have a rough go at acting, Misha starts to get frustrated with how many takes they need to film the scene. Collins revealed at a convention that wanted to ""douche the character up as much as possible."" He pushes one crew member away and ignores another. During a break in filming, Misha sends another fantastic tweet that Misha Collins posted a few hours after the first. Fake-Misha had one other tweet to send that read, ""Ever get that feeling... Someone's in the backseat? Frowny face."" Unfortunately, the angel that followed Sam and Dean was, in fact, in the backseat.

Virgil popped up and held a knife to Misha's throat before he could press send. After that, Virgil kills Misha to make a transdimensional call to Raphael. This final tweet never got posted in real life either, but he did keep the meta, reality-hopping story going with a final tweet.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Devika and Danny Review: A relatable supernatural drama","https://telugucinema.com/news/devika-and-danny-review-a-relatable-supernatural-drama","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 09:37:45 GMT","

Chaganti Sudhakar, a young producer well-known in the film industry for his association with several notable films, is now venturing into web series production under his Joy Films banner. His maiden web series, “Devika and Danny,” starring Ritu Varma in the lead role, has premiered on JioCinema. Let's analyse.

Story:

Devika (Ritu), a soft-spoken music teacher living in a village, out of family pressure, agrees to marry. Her would-be partner Jaggi (Subbaraju) is insecure and controlling. Her life takes a new turn when she meets Danny (Surya Vashistta) at the school where she teaches. Their bond grows slowly, bringing joy to what would otherwise be a routine life. But Danny is not an ordinary man and has a dark past. How far will Devika go to help him fulfil an unfinished promise?

Plus Points:

What makes ‘Devika and Danny' work is its easy, relatable storytelling that's also progressive. The supernatural element is used smartly in the story; it's not meant to scare, but to transform the protagonist. The tone is light, the romance is subtle, and the emotional beats are handled with sensitivity. The show is ideally catered to viewers who want something wholesome but not heavy.

Ritu Varma is as graceful as ever, though stereotyped in similar roles. She brings both vulnerability and quiet determination to Devika's character arc. Surya Vashistta, as Danny, fits the part of the friendly ghost, though he could portray his emotions better. The on-screen relationship between Devika and Danny is built with warmth, which is refreshing.

The other actors make their presence felt too. Shiva Kandukuri's easy-going persona as Subbu adds lightness and charm. Kovai Sarala, usually known for loud comic roles, surprises with a grounded, sincere performance. Mounika Reddy, in a small role, makes a strong impression, while Goparaju Ramana and Subbaraju bring familiarity to the village setting.

The show's strength lies in its ability to blend multiple genres like romance, drama, fantasy, and even light comedy, without becoming confusing. The narrative is kept simple and engaging, making it ideal for audiences who prefer character-focused, easygoing stories over complex dramas.

Visually, the show is pleasant. The cinematography by Venkat C Dilip brings authenticity to the village setting with the use of bright colours. Jay Krish's music is easy on the ears and complements the changing contours of the story. The production design and Joy Films' production values are largely impressive. The episodes are short, making it easy to binge. The editing is sharp and sustains the momentum of the show without unnecessary detours.

Minus Points:

While the series has heart, it sometimes plays too safe. The emotional conflicts, especially around Danny's backstory, look slightly superficial. The flashback feels slightly underdeveloped, the promise he makes and the woman involved could have been given more weight, for a better impact.Some characters feel underwritten. As a character, Jaggi has no substance.. Annie, Devika's colleague, has potential but doesn't get the space the part deserves. The local thug subplot lacks any newness. These parts come in the way of the otherwise crisp storytelling.

The show's structure, while neat, often feels more like a film stretched across episodes. Devika's transformation happens smoothly, almost too easily at times. There aren't enough obstacles for a viewer to believe her transformation. The conflicts appear trivial, too and don't leave a lasting impact.

Verdict:

“Devika and Danny” is a largely light, heartwarming series. With its supernatural elements, an emotional flashback, and a relatable protagonist, it's a satisfying, one-time watch. While the writing and characters could've had more depth, it still manages to impress. If you enjoy simple, comforting stories with a mix of romance and a touch of fantasy, this show is worth checking out.

Rating: 3/5

Dylan Thuras: It was 1988, and all year, Jim Weiner had been having a terrible time sleeping. He was having nightmares, but these were not normal nightmares, because Jim said he felt like he was awake, almost like it was some kind of sleep paralysis.

He'd wake up to the overwhelming sense that there was someone in the room with him. He'd hear a flurry of voices, but he couldn't understand them. He couldn't move anything but his eyes. And often, his twin brother Jack was there, along with two college friends, Chuck and Charlie.

Jim would be lying on this table in a bright white room. At first, Jim thought he knew what was causing this strange, awful sensation. Years earlier, he'd been in a bad accident. He'd injured his spine and his brainstem. He told his psychiatrist, it seems like things were under control.

They were going to get better. But then Jim got on the phone with his brother Jack, and they made a very unnerving discovery.

This was happening to Jack too. The bright white room, the table, Charlie and Chuck, the paralysis. Jack said he was seeing the same things. And as they dug deeper, the brothers would trace this strange sensation to an incident that happened more than a decade earlier, in the north woods of Maine, in the Allagash Wilderness Waterway.

I'm Dylan Thuras, and this is Atlas Obscura. And today, we are talking UFOs. We are talking alien abductions. And we're doing it National Parks style.

This is an edited transcript of the Atlas Obscura Podcast: a celebration of the world's strange, incredible, and wondrous places. Find the show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major podcast apps.

Dylan: National Parks are pretty much universally beloved. You have to be, like, a pretty unpleasant person to really dislike National Parks. But there's also this other side to these enormous wild places. People die or disappear in National Parks actually pretty frequently. I don't say this to discourage anyone from visiting the parks. Millions and millions of people go there. They are wonderful. They are safe. They are amazing. But they are big and they are wild. And there's a hidden side to everything, including these places that we revere. So I am here today with two people who know more about the dark and sinister side of National Parks than I would guess almost anyone else. Danielle LaRock and Cassie Yahnian are hosts of the podcast National Park After Dark, a podcast for the morbid outdoor enthusiast, which is not a thing that I knew I was until I heard your work. So, Danielle, Cassie, thanks for coming on the show.

Danielle LaRock: Thank you so much for the lovely introduction.

Cassie Yahnian: Yes. We're excited to be here.

Dylan: It's great. Meeting of the morbid outdoor enthusiasts. Yeah, so where are you two right now in the world? You look like you are in nice places.

Danielle: I'm in Maine.

Dylan: Oh, great.

Cassie: Yeah, and I'm in Vermont.

Dylan: Oh, nice. Yeah, this is great. I went to college in Bennington.

Cassie: Oh, very cool. Bennington's a very cool area.

Dylan: Yeah. It's also actually a place where there's like all these weird, mysterious disappearances. The like, little Bennington Triangle. It's like a whole—we could do a whole other thing.

Danielle: There's some vibes happening.

Dylan: There's some vibes. There are some vibes in that Bennington Triangle. And we're going to get back to Jack and Jim's story in just a second. But to further set the mood, why don't you give me a quick lightning round of a few of your favorite morbid stories that have taken place in national parks. Danielle, go.

Danielle: Okay. Everglades National Park. In the 1800s, bird populations were being decimated for fashion and one of the first men who tried to save them was killed for it.

Cassie: Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park. A backcountry ranger went missing while out on patrol and then the largest search operation ever recorded in those parks uncovered a complicated marriage, a mistress, and reasons he may have wanted to disappear.

Danielle: Joshua Tree National Park. Graham Parsons' friends wanted him to go out like he lived: as a rock star. After his untimely end, they stole his body from a plane, loaded it into a friend's hearse, drove it into Joshua Tree, and attempted a makeshift cremation.

Dylan: It makes me think the cremation went poorly.

Cassie: It did.

Dylan: That's a lot of, like, death, murder, mayhem in national parks. It just makes me feel like people, I don't know, maybe there's just something about national parks where people feel like they can get away with things. So, okay, let's talk about one of these cases. Let's get back to our brothers, Jim and Jack. And this story takes place in the Allagash Wilderness, which is technically not a national park, but an enormous state park in Maine. More than a decade before the brothers are having these strange visions, back in 1976, Jack and Jim are in their 20s. And what's going on with them? What sort of precipitates all of this stuff that happens later?

Danielle: Yeah, so you set the scene so brilliantly, so let's pick up from there. In August of 1976, the twins, Jim and Jack, along with Charlie Foltz and Chuck Rak, were in the midst of a two-week camping trip and fishing trip along the Allagash Waterway. The area, like you said, is part of the National Wild and Scenic River System. For anyone who has not been to Maine or Northern Maine, it's absolutely beautiful. It's super remote, and this area in particular is about 93 miles long worth of ribbons of lakes and streams, and it's just so beautiful. And the four of them had prepared for this trip for nearly a year beforehand, prepping, researching, getting ready to go. So at this point in time, they're dropped off in the wilderness by a bush plane, and they began their journey.

Dylan: And you said they got dropped off by a plane. So, I mean, they're, like, totally alone out there. It's, like, not the place you would bump into a random stranger. They seem quite far out in the wilderness.

Danielle: You can't just drive or walk up to a place like this. You need to intentionally seek it out. There's a few other campers around, moreso people that are doing a similar thing, right? So, canoers and paddlers—actually, this day, they run into another group of campers on a lake that they are also planning to camp on. And they had lost—one of the teenagers in their group had gotten separated and hadn't come back to their campsite yet. So, they actually offered to search for him. And this is when kind of the prelude happens to the encounter. And they're picking up binoculars, they're scanning this lake for the teenager. That's when the entire group all initially spot something strange that they, at first, just kind of write off as, ah, that's a weird, strange light in the sky.

Dylan: What do they see?

Danielle: So, when they're scanning the tree line, they're looking through binoculars. All of these people see this bright light, and it was in the eastern part of the sky, and it was moving slightly. And at first, they collectively thought they were maybe looking at Mars because it had this reddish tint to it. But suddenly, they all kind of look at each other like, this is weird. Because not only did everyone notice it, it was astoundingly bright. It seemed to be hovering about 200 feet from the top of the tree line. And then it all of a sudden, as they describe it, inverted on itself. So, it closed in kind of like an eyelid shutting, and then it blinked out from sight.

Dylan: That's not—that's slightly unnerving. Did they ever find the people they were looking for?

Danielle: Yes. The kid came back, and it was fine. And then they all went their separate ways and never saw each other again.

Dylan: Right. So, this sort of strange thing happens as they're looking for this lost camper, and they find the camper. Seems like that was not the end of things. What do they do after they have that first experience?

Cassie: So, later that evening, after settling into camp and making a large fire on the lake shore, the men decided that they wanted to go back onto the lake and do a night paddle. And that night was pretty eerie and quiet. They actually kind of noticed how dark it was and how quiet things were. And while Chuck was paddling, he suddenly felt like something was off, and he really felt like he could feel someone watching him. So, he threw his gaze over his shoulder, and he saw this ball of light rising from the trees about 200 yards away. Jim, Jack, and Charlie, they all turned around at this point to look, and a large round bright light was rising more above this tree line. It ascended roughly 300 feet, and then it hovered. It fluctuated between red, green, and yellow, and it wasn't solid, but rather had an almost liquid appearance to it.

Dylan: I would be pretty highly alarmed here if this is what was going on.

Danielle: So, after they all noticed this light rising up, they noticed a couple of things. First of all, it's way closer than whatever they saw hours prior. It is illuminating the entire forest, and it's dead silent. Chuck decides to lean down, grab his flashlight, points it at this source of light, and clicks the flashlight on and off in the universal, at least earthly, signal for SOS. And suddenly, this light source emits a light source of its own, kind of like a searchlight, and starts scanning the water, and it's moving in their direction. So, now, collectively, all the men are having this oh crap moment.

Dylan: Yeah, at this point.

Danielle: And start paddling like crazy back to their camp. So, they get back to the shoreline, but interestingly, there's a chunk of time that they can't recall, at least at first. So, they all remember seeing this light and turning to paddle back to shore, and then the next thing they remember is skidding up onto the shoreline to their campsite, where just 20 minutes prior, they had set a huge fire. And their fire is now smoldering, just smoldering coals. So, they clocked that as strange, and they kind of talked amongst each other for a brief minute about, huh, that was kind of weird, right? And then they all remember feeling like they were in this daze, and kind of equated it to after you come out of anesthesia, you're awake and you're conscious, but you're loopy and kind of scatterbrained. And they just went to sleep. The next day, they get up, they ran into a ranger, actually, and inquired if, you know, did you see anything like that? What was that?

Dylan: Yeah, what could that have been?

Danielle: Yeah. And he actually said, well, you know, there's a new hardware store out in Millinocket that had those, you know, those big Hollywood floodlights. And, you know, that is dozens of miles away. It does not match the description of what they encountered. So, they kind of said, oh, okay. Like, sure, that sounds like it. Thanks.

Dylan: Yeah, the local hardware store opening, you know, yeah, right.

Danielle: That must be it, right. But, yeah, so anyways, after that, they kind of dropped it, surprisingly. They continued their trip. They went on with their entire lives. They went back to school. They graduated. They had families. And like you said at the beginning, you know, decades go by. We're now in 1988 where this is starting to surface again.

Dylan: Okay, so we are back to where we started. Jim is having these crazy night visions. He talks to his brother, Jack. They realize that they're maybe experiencing the same thing. How does this all sort of start to connect for them? How do they start to realize that maybe there's something more to this past experience than what they initially thought?

Cassie: Well, then they ended up contacting Chuck and Charlie to speak about that night again, to be like, hey, are you experiencing any of this? Like, we're both having these weird dreams. Are you? And then it turned out that all of them were experiencing the same thing, and it was kind of that moment where they're like, wait, we forgot about this. We kind of pushed it to the side, but maybe there's something more here that we didn't realize.

Dylan: Yeah.

Danielle: And surprisingly, you know, you mentioned that Jim's physicians initially said, hey, we're going to recommend you for further help. And of all people, they recommend him to a ufologist. And that ufologist is the one that recommended they start doing some regression hypnotherapy. All four of the men agreed to do that. And separately, they start to uncover eerily similar experiences of lost memories from that evening.

Dylan: To quickly recap, Jim, Jack, Chuck, Charlie, they go on this trip in the 70s, they've got this crazy experience with these floating lights, they kind of lose time, which is like classic UFO stuff, you know, you're like, I was only gone for five minutes, what do you mean? And then a decade later, they end up talking to this alien researcher, they do this hypnotic regression therapy. And over the course of that two years, they all end up with this sort of picture, or they converge on this understanding, of what happened. So what do they end up saying happened during that key, like missing period?

Danielle: Yeah. So long story short: They all—after two years—they come to realize that under hypnosis, they were finding out the same things. Essentially, they all recalled being aboard a spacecraft, where they were all subjected to different medical examinations by some of these humanoid entities. They all described them as having large heads, dark eyes, slender bodies, they don't speak with words, but rather telepathically send messages to them. And that was what was coming up also in their dreams and starting to kind of surface that way.

Dylan: Right. Yeah, what you're describing sounds a lot like the visions that Jim described having 10 years later.

Danielle: Yeah. Now they're all under the impression of, wow, we were gone for hours. We thought it was minutes. And we were abducted by aliens and experimented on and placed back into our canoe and sent on our way.

Dylan: And they like, they ended up, you know, sort of becoming a little bit famous, right?

Danielle: Yeah. And to be clear, you know, there, at first they were very scared. They were—this was traumatic memories for them. This was not something they looked back on fondly. After this collective understanding of this is a shared experience, or at least that's what they were under the impression of, they come to this sort of solace that, you know, this happened and let's own it and let's start talking about it. And that's what they did. And for years, they went on different speaking circuits. They talk a lot at different UFO conferences.

Dylan: Yeah, right. They became known as the Allagash Four, this kind of like, you know, group of abductees who could just talk about this experience and kind of shared it. But then later, later, I think it's Charlie, was it Chuck or Charlie? Who came forward?

Danielle: Chuck. Chuck was the one.

Dylan: Okay. Yeah. Chuck came forward and said, basically, yeah, some of this is bullshit, or like, we made some of this up. Like, did he actually say it was a hoax or was he sort of just like walking back some of it?

Danielle: He walked back some of it. So, his stance was that the incident with the other campers and seeing that strange light was true.

Dylan: Yeah.

Danielle: And also their experience on the lake, just the four of them, was true. Where he started to go off on his own was saying that the abduction part was fabricated. But the other guys point to, yeah, well, the only reason he's saying that now after years of us going on Joan Rivers and doing different television programs and all of this and wanting to write books, and the only reason he's saying that is because we had a big falling out in our friendship.

Dylan: I mean, I have to ask the question, what do you two think? You guys spend a lot of time out, way out in the wilderness, you know, under the night sky. I mean, are you believers?

Cassie: It would be very unbelievable for me to think that we are the only planet with life on it. You know? I think that it is way more unrealistic to think that we are the only people or life forms that exist in the entire universe.

Dylan: What about you, Danielle?

Danielle: I co-sign all of that.

Dylan: Have you two ever seen anything truly weird and unexplainable on any of your adventures?

Danielle: I saw Starlink and thought it was UFOs.

Dylan: I know so many people who were convinced they were seeing an alien invasion, but were just 100 percent seeing Starlink. Like, what is that? That's funny. Yes. It's super interesting. I don't know what I think. Maybe I'm more of a skeptic than you two. I have some mixed feelings. It's clear that, like, for some of these kind of abductee cases, like, something is going on. People are having very intense and genuinely traumatic experiences. They are experiencing something real for them. And I can't help but note that when all this is happening, like the late 80s and the early 90s, this is an absolute alien craze, right? The X-Files has just started. All of this stuff is happening on TV about, like, Area 51. There's, like, nothing hotter than kind of, like, weird aliens. I think it's possible, you know, they're doing this hypnotic regression therapy. And one of the big critiques of this is that it can, like, implant memories. And the person who did this to them also, like, wrote a book about it, and I think probably did pretty well on that book. I honestly don't know. It seems likely that they saw something very strange, to which I have no explanation of.

Danielle: So now that we're all kind of coming around to the government being like, yeah, aliens are real, you know, that's not new.

Dylan: Or at least we don't know what any of this stuff is. Like, we can't tell you or we don't know.

Danielle: Right. We can't confirm nor deny. But you know, now, as time goes on, we're starting to accept that aliens might be real. Whether or not they're the gray aliens that we think of when we imagine an alien, or if they're something completely different, we're coming around to the thought that we aren't alone in the universe.

Dylan: Interesting. Yeah, I think one of the things I like about this story is just that, especially when you're out there in the wilderness at night on your own, whatever—sometimes I do these bike rides, these, like, late night bike rides that go, it's like a full moon ride, and we all go look at the full moon, it's really nice—and I'm riding through a really familiar trail, but I'm riding at night, my little flashlight is shining. And the whole thing just starts to take on this other terrifying kind of aspect. And I can't really explain it. It's not rational. But I just, I do think that sometimes we just have experiences that we cannot explain. And there's something about being in the woods at night that just evokes those kinds of experiences. And I almost don't feel like I need an explanation to understand that feeling of: something is happening that I can't quite explain. How has covering all this affected your relationship with national parks and wilderness areas? Does it ever freak you out? Do you, you know, at night, camping out somewhere far away, are you, like, flashing back to these stories? Or are you kind of like, this is what we live for?

Cassie: Sometimes. I mean, yeah, for sure. There are, I think, on the brighter side, sometimes these stories, I like to feel like I am more prepared and more knowledgeable. But on the other side, when I have extensively researched a grizzly bear mauling, I cannot help but worry when I'm sleeping outdoors in grizzly territory.

Dylan: Also, a grizzly is not—that's a reasonable thing to be afraid of in a national park. That's quite a practical, real thing to be like, yeah, don't attract the grizzly to the tent. Danielle, how about you?

Danielle: I definitely am way more aware of my surroundings, but I'm trying to adopt her mantra of whatever's happening outside of the tent is none of my business.

Dylan: Yeah, good. Whatever that weird sound was, don't worry about it.

Danielle: Right.

Dylan: That was Danielle LaRock and Cassie Yahnian. They are the hosts of a really delightful, sometimes terrifying podcast called National Park After Dark. It's basically kind of true crime survival adventure in national parks. And you can find it wherever you get your podcast. It is really delightful. Give it a listen.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Psychic","Psychic 'predicted' Donald Trump and Elon Musk's epic duel","https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/psychic-predicted-donald-trump-elon-35347402","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 11:14:00 GMT","

A psychic spookily 'predicted' the dramatic bromance breakup of Donald Trump and Elon Musk - and what could happen next for the big manbabies.

In a showdown that felt like something from South Park, the ego-bromaniacs publicly imploded their 'special' relationship in real time on X and Truth Social - allowing the world to watch on.

Musk lit the flame of the unpredictable US president by slamming Trump's ""big beautiful bill"", and ordered (we repeat) for the genuinely titled ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" to be scrapped.

This did not go down well with Trump, which caused the orange politician to retaliate by threatening to bin off Musk's lucrative government contracts.

Tesla and SpaceX boss Musk then entered a rant about Trump, including claiming that Trump features in the unreleased Jeffrey Epstein files. There is no suggestion that Donald Trump knew of any crimes or participated in any criminal behaviour.

As the world munches on theoretical popcorn, refreshing their screens to see the latest digs, one woman knew that the fiery exchanges were going to happen - and when.

Celebrity psychic and astrologer Inbaal Honigman spoke to us at the beginning of March, just over a month after Trump's controversial inauguration where he awarded Musk - who is not an elected official - government contracts and appointed him head of Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Using her special 'all-knowing' powers and deep reading of the Horoscope, she predicted 'two-faced' Gemini Trump would clash with 'oversensitive' Cancerian Musk around this time period.

She spectacularly prophesied: ""As one of them is much more loyal than the other, they will clash between May 24 and June 26.

""Between May and June, Gemini and Cancer have an epiphany.

""Each of their star signs will be called to act on impulse, but their impulses are wildly different so their friendship will struggle. Mercury, which is the planet of communication, will be in the sign of Gemini between 26 May 2025 and 8 June.

""Not only will this whole deal with Mercury cause a clash between those business besties, but this rift is likely to be very public, because Mercury isn't a subtle planet...""

Now, months on from her impressive prophecy, Inbaal exclusively caught up with the Daily Star to share how she knew and what she thinks will happen next with the 'erratic' ex-best friends.

Inbaal managed to 'predict' the dramatic feud thanks to her deep understanding of the Horoscope, with Musk and Trump's sign giving away their intentions of the friendship.

On behalf of Spin Genie, she told us: ""Geminis like Trump are social and outgoing, they love feeling popular. Those born under the sign of the Twins have a great need for reassurance by others because they like to feel included and heard.

""Cancerians like Musk are sensitive and vulnerable, so they also need constant reassurance, for different reasons. Those born under the sign of the Crab can be moody, and they need emotional validation.

""Therefore, the clash between Trump and Musk is not really about policy, or about personal disagreements, but rather it is a popularity contest, with each of them wanting to be liked more than the other.""

Inbaal now believes, because of Trump's 'two-faced' star sign, that all traces of Musk will be wiped from the White House and it will be as if he was ""never"" there.

As Gemini Trump 'loves' feeling popular, the public disobedience and challenging from Musk will push the president to cut all ties and could even disband DOGE all together.

Despite Musk stepping down from the job cutting taskforce that he formulated and ran, Inbaal reckons the connection to the rocket-obsessive will be enough for Trump to do away with it all.

She explained: ""Within the space of a few days in June 2025, the dynamic between the two will change, and it will be as if Musk was never in the White House in the first place. Even the DOGE office could be dissolved.

""Both Trump and Musk can see right now, that all eyes are on Trump.

""Both Mercury, planet of communication and Jupiter, planet of wealth are in Trump's sign, Gemini. This means that the President is pleased to be in the headlines, no matter the reason, and the Tesla CEO is upset about losing his popularity.""

However, things are set to change again by Sunday 8 June. This is because the ruling planet of communication, Mercury, will move from Gemini into Cancer. And on Monday, planet of 'luck' Jupiter will also transfer into Musk's star sign.

Although Musk's popularity has plummeted, along with Tesla shares, Inbaal reckons that his star sign month will put him back in favour.

The psychic explained: ""On June 8, Mercury moves from Gemini into Cancer. On June 9, Jupiter also moves from Gemini into Cancer.

""Musk will then decide to step away from the feud with a few barbed parting shots, as he turns his attention to his businesses. We will witness a few final ill-advised tweets before he leaves his political aspirations behind.

""Jupiter, planet of wealth and luck, leaves Trump's sign, where it's been for a year, and switches into Musk's sign, where it will stay for a year.

""Good luck will follow Elon as he throws himself into his work.""

So, what about Trump? Well, Inbaal says that the president is a typical Gemini - and they do not like being alone.

Before Musk, Trump was buddy-buddy with Steve Bannon, who spectacularly came out in the president's defence on Thursday evening by urging him to deport the Tesla owner.

Inbaal reckons he'll be bringing out Melania more-so until he can find another 'bro-panion'. That means we can expect more photo-ops of the couple, and perhaps more conspiracies about 'doubles' of the First Lady...

The astrologer concluded: ""And as for Trump, true to his Gemini nature that hates being alone, he'll form a new double act.

""Instead of the Trump-Musk love fest, he will do anything in his power to bring Melania by his side and point a spotlight on his beautiful wife.

""From June 6, Venus planet of love goes ‘home' into Melania's star sign, Taurus. Taurus is governed by Venus, and it is a home loving combination.

""After July 5, Venus planet of love goes into Trump's star sign, Gemini.

""There will be a lot more photo ops of Mr and Mrs Trump, his 20-year romance to replace the businessmen bromance.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=psyops","Conspiracy World Thinks the Musk-Trump Breakup Is a ‘Psyop'","https://www.wired.com/story/conspiracy-world-qanon-musk-trump-breakup-fake-psyop/","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 14:22:54 GMT","

The extremely public and increasingly unhinged breakup of Elon Musk and President Donald Trump has caused chaos in DC, forced Silicon Valley executives to pick sides, and wiped more than $150 billion off Tesla's market cap.

But in the conspiracy-theory-addicted corners of the internet, the feud between Musk and Trump is nothing more than a fake, planned distraction. After Musk posted on X about Trump's alleged relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the multimillionaire charged with sex trafficking of minors—“@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files,” Musk wrote. “That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!”—conspiracy theorists were convinced this was all a plan to trick Democrats into calling for the Epstein files to be published.

Rather than admit that two of their favorite people have fallen out and are making increasingly dire threats against each other, QAnon folks prefer to believe that this is all part of a scheme cooked up by the pair in recent months.

“Smooth-brained folks who haven't been paying attention and don't understand that kayfabe is in play, actually believe Trump and Musk are fighting,” AwakenedOutlaw, an anonymous X account that promotes far-right talking points with over 300,000 followers, wrote on Thursday evening. Kayfabe is a decades-old term used in the world of pro wrestling to describe how wrestlers maintain the illusion that fights are real and that their hatred of their opponents extends outside the ring.

For the influencers and grifters dedicated to the QAnon conspiracy world, kayfabe has become a crucial tool to maintain a veil of credibility when reality seems to jar with conspiracy theories. By claiming that events that don't fit their predictions are fake, influencers in the community can ensure that their followers stay dedicated to the movement.

And on Thursday evening, within minutes of the Trump-Musk feud kicking off, influencers very quickly began calling it all fake or part of a game of “5D chess.”

“It's a wonderful game of 5D chess! Get the popcorn out, and watch the left go wild,” wrote one member of the Telegram channel run by prominent election denier David Clements.

Liz Crokin, a Pizzagate conspiracy theorist who met Trump in Mar-a-Lago in 2022, pushed the conspiracy theory even further. In a post on X that has been viewed 440,000 times, she claims that “it would not surprise me if the Deep State created fake evidence falsely implicating Trump. If this is the case, their scheme will fail and backfire. So grab your popcorn and watch the media and Democrats falsely report Trump is a pedophile and a sex trafficker—this boomerang will be epic! 5D chess at its finest, baby—checkmate!”

While Musk is mentioned in a couple of Q drops—the anonymous posts on fringe message boards that followers believe were written by government insiders—he was not a major figure within the movement until last year. Thanks to his role in Trump's reelection and his decision to allow all QAnon accounts back onto X, Musk is highly lauded within the community. The centibillionaire even posted a video with QAnon references to his 200 million X followers on the eve of the 2024 election.

A prominent QAnon promoter who goes by MJ Truth suggested that this spat was dreamt up prior to Trump's inauguration, when Musk was spending significant time at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

“Elon Musk basically lived at Mar-A-Lago for a few months,” he wrote on his Telegram channel. “Lots of time to plan things out. As much as they are trying to sell this argument to everyone that this is real, it isn't. Only anons understand why … It's KAYFAB [sic] on a MAGAnamonous level.”

When Politico reported late Thursday about a potential detente between Musk and Trump, MJ Truth wrote on Telegram: “Told ya, Kayfabe.”

A similar situation occurred in 2018 when former attorney general Jeff Session was attacked and then fired by Trump during his first term. Because someone who claimed they were “Q” and created the QAnon movement had previously writte, “TRUST SESSIONS,” influencers quickly said Trump's attacks were fake and just part of his ongoing battle to expose the deep state.

Outside of QAnon, conspiracy theorists were struggling to come to terms with MAGA's biggest figures having such a public falling out. “This World stands on the brink of Total Destruction,” Alex Jones, the conspiracist who called the Sandy Hook school shootings a hoax and was sued for defamation and found liable by default, wrote on X, adding that he would need to investigate the allegations about Trump and the Epstein files further before picking a side.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","Conspiracy World Thinks the Musk-Trump Breakup Is a ‘Psyop'","https://www.wired.com/story/conspiracy-world-qanon-musk-trump-breakup-fake-psyop/","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 14:22:54 GMT","

The extremely public and increasingly unhinged breakup of Elon Musk and president Donald Trump has caused chaos in DC, forced Silicon Valley executives to pick a side, and wiped more than $150 billion off Tesla's market cap.

But in the conspiracy theory-addicted corners of the internet, the feud between Musk and Trump is nothing more than a fake, planned distraction. After Musk posted on X about Trump's alleged relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the multimillionaire charged with sex trafficking of minors—“@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files,” Musk wrote.“That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!”—conspiracy theorists were convinced this was all a plan to trick Democrats into calling for the Epstein files to be published.

Rather than admit that two of their favorite people have fallen out and are making increasingly dire threats against each other, QAnon folks prefer to believe that this is all part of a scheme cooked up by the pair in recent months.

“Smooth-brained folks who haven't been paying attention and don't understand that kayfabe is in play, actually believe Trump and Musk are fighting,” AwakenedOutlaw, an anonymous X account that promotes far-right talking points with over 300,000 followers, wrote on Thursday evening. Kayfabe is a decades-old term used in the world of pro wrestling to describe how wrestlers maintain the illusion that fights are real and that their hatred of their opponents extends outside the ring.

For the influencers and grifters dedicated to the QAnon conspiracy world, kayfabe has become a crucial tool to maintain a veil of credibility when reality seems to jar with conspiracy theories. By claiming that events which don't fit their predictions are fake influencers in the community can ensure their followers stay dedicated to the movement.

And on Thursday evening, within minutes of the Trump-Musk feud kicking off, influencers very quickly began calling it all fake or part of a game of “5D chess.”

“It's a wonderful game of 5D chess! Get the popcorn out, and watch the left go wild,” wrote one member of the Telegram channel run by prominent election denier David Clements.

Liz Crokin, a Pizzagate conspiracy theorist who met Trump in Mar-a-Lago in 2022, pushed the conspiracy theory even further. In a post on X that has been viewed 440,000 times, she claims that “it would not surprise me if the Deep State created fake evidence falsely implicating Trump. If this is the case, their scheme will fail and backfire. So grab your popcorn and watch the media and Democrats falsely report Trump is a pedophile and a sex trafficker—this boomerang will be epic! 5D chess at its finest, baby  —checkmate!”

While Musk is mentioned in a couple of Q drops—the anonymous posts on fringe message boards followers believe were written by government insiders—he was not a major figure within the movement until last year. Thanks to his role in Trump's reelection and his decision to allow all QAnon accounts back onto X, Musk is highly lauded within the community. The centibillionaire even posted a video with QAnon references to his 200 million X followers on the eve of the 2024 election.

A prominent QAnon promoter who goes by MJ Truth suggested that this spat was dreamt up prior to Trump's inauguration when Musk was spending significant time at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

“Elon Musk basically lived at Mar-A-Lago for a few months,” he wrote on his Telegram channel. “Lots of time to plan things out. As much as they are trying to sell this argument to everyone that this is real, it isn't. Only anons understand why…It's KAYFAB [sic] on a MAGAnamonous level.”

When Politico reported late Thursday about a potential detente between Musk and Trump, MJ Truth wrote on Telegram: “Told ya, Kayfabe.”

A similar situation occurred in 2018 when former attorney general Jeff Session was attacked and then fired by Trump during his first term. Because someone who claimed they were “Q” and created the QAnon movement had previously written “TRUST SESSIONS,” influencers quickly said Trump's attacks were fake and just part of his ongoing battle to expose the deep state.

Outside of QAnon, conspiracy theorists were struggling to come to terms with MAGA's biggest figures having such a public falling out. “This World stands on the brink of Total Destruction,” Alex Jones, the conspiracist who called the Sandy Hook school shootings a hoax and was sued for defamation and found liable by default, wrote on X, adding that he would need to investigate the allegations about Trump and the Epstein files further before picking a side.

Meanwhile, Jack Posobiec, a prominent Pizzagate promoter who recently traveled to Ukraine as a member of the press with a Trump cabinet member, put the whole thing down to men being men.

Thursday marked another heavy passage of time for the family of Rachel Hansen, the 19-year-old whose life was violently taken three years ago in her Gilbert apartment. Despite the ongoing efforts by authorities, the quest to find her killer continues amidst renewed yet cautious optimism from Rachel's parents. “We never imagined to be here, three years later,” Todd and Kim Hansen said in a statement obtained by FOX 10 Phoenix, expressing the prolonged agony of not having closure.

Initial reports were scant on leads. A heavily redacted 300-page report released by Gilbert Police mentioned a person of interest, but the investigation came to a halt as it was listed as suspended due to the lack of leads. Yet, the tide seems to have shifted somewhat. The Hansens have revealed that recent discussions with detectives have unearthed “some good leads and good information,” as they strive for answers and justice for their daughter. These updates, while not publicly detailed, could signify movement in an otherwise stagnant case, reported FOX 10.

The trove of papers from pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing was discovered in a loft.

A trove of Alan Turing's papers, including his own personal copy of his PhD dissertation, is going up for auction June 17 after narrowly avoiding destruction.

The papers were ""offprints,"" or copies of papers distributed in small batches within academia. They include not only Turing's signed dissertation, but also 1937's ""On Computable Numbers,"" considered the first computer programming manual, and 1952's ""The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis,"" Turing's last major published work.

Turing was an English mathematician, codebreaker and one of the first computer scientists. The newly discovered papers were given by his mother, Ethel Turing, to her son's friend, fellow mathematician Norman Routledge, according to Rare Book Auctions, the company handling the sale.

After Norman's death in 2013, one of his daughters stuck the papers in her own loft. When she moved into a care home almost a decade later, one of her daughters found the papers and considered shredding them. But she asked around the family and decided to get them appraised instead, taking them along to specialists Rare Books Auctions in a carrier bag.

""Nothing could've prepared me for what I was about to find in that carrier bag,"" Rare Books Auction director Jim Spencer said in a statement.

The auction house is offering the papers for individual sale. They are expected to fetch a price of 40,000 to 60,000 British pounds ($54,220 to $81,324) for the copy of ""On Computable Numbers,"" which introduced the idea of a ""universal computing machine,"" and a similar price for the signed dissertation.

“We even have Turing's first published paper from 1935 – Equivalence of Left and Right Almost Periodicity – which is simply a single sheet of paper,"" Spencer said.

Ethel Turing made her gift to Routledge in May 1956, nearly two years after Turing died at age 41 on June 7, 1954. After a brilliant career at Princeton University, where he earned his doctorate, and Bletchley Park, the U.K.'s code-breaking agency, Turing worked at the U.K.'s National Physical Laboratory and the University of Manchester, where he designed some of the first forerunners of today's computers.

But in 1952, while reporting a burglary, he acknowledged a sexual relationship with another man to police and was persecuted under an 1885 law that criminalized homosexual acts as ""gross indecency."" To avoid prison, he was forced to submit to chemical castration — doses of estrogen that had a feminizing effect. He was also denied entry into the United States.

Turing was found dead in his home of cyanide poisoning, which may have been a result of suicide or an accident resulting from a chemistry experiment he was running at the time. His case inspired a 2009 apology from the British government and a 2017 law, known as the ""Alan Turing Law,"" that retroactively pardons people convicted under historical legislation in England and Wales for homosexual acts.

A war of words between SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump could lead to significant fallout for U.S.-led space exploration.

An explosive, and very public, feud between President Donald Trump and SpaceX founder Elon Musk on Thursday (June 5) has raised doubts over the future of America's space industry.

The war of words could place $22 billion of SpaceX's government contracts with multiple U.S. space programs at risk, according to one estimate, although the real figure — which remains classified — could be significantly higher.

Following threats from the president on his social media platform Truth Social that the U.S. could cancel the government contracts and subsidies awarded to Musk's companies, the CEO of SpaceX retorted that his space company would ""begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.""

Hours later, Musk responded to a follower telling him to ""cool off"" by saying ""Good advice. Ok, we won't decommission Dragon.""

Good advice. Ok, we won't decommission Dragon.June 6, 2025

The disagreement began on Tuesday (June 3) when Musk criticized the administration's proposed tax and spending bill on his social media platform X.

""This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it,"" Musk wrote on X.

This then escalated into a full-blown social media feud on Thursday, with Musk claiming that Trump's name appears in unreleased files relating to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The White House condemned these allegations. ""This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,"" representatives wrote on X.

Trump then claimed Musk ""just went CRAZY,"" posting: ""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!""

SpaceX's Dragon capsule is a reusable spacecraft capable of carrying up to seven passengers and cargo to and from Earth orbit, according to SpaceX. NASA currently relies on the capsule to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS), so canceling these government contracts effectively eliminates America's ability to launch astronauts to space from American soil, Live Science's sister website, Space.com, reported.

NASA also heavily relies on SpaceX for other space programs, having selected the Starship Human Landing System (HLS), a lunar lander variant of the company's next-generation Starship spacecraft, to carry American astronauts to the moon for the first time in more than 50 years aboard the 2027 Artemis 3 mission.

NASA is investing $4 billion into Starship's development, and canceling its contract could seriously handicap NASA and the future of U.S.-led space exploration.

While other competitors exist, such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin and Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, they lag far behind SpaceX.

—Facing steep funding cuts, scientists propose using black holes as particle colliders instead of building new ones on Earth

—Trump's 2026 budget would slash NASA funding by 24% and its workforce by nearly one third

—NASA plans to build a giant radio telescope on the 'dark side' of the moon. Here's why.

The Starliner capsule is not yet certified to fly operational astronaut missions and was responsible for ""stranding"" two astronauts on the ISS for nine months last year. The astronauts returned to Earth on March 18 aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule, and neither Boeing nor NASA have offered any significant updates into fixes that will make Starliner flightworthy.

SpaceX's lead on its competitors is reflected in the size of its government subsidies. In April, the U.S. Space Force, the military branch of U.S. space exploration, awarded the company nearly $6 billion in launch contracts, while the United Launch Alliance received $5.4 billion and Blue Origin $2.4 billion.

In response to the feud between Musk and Trump, NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens declined to comment on SpaceX, but she did tell Reuters that ""we will continue to work with our industry partners to ensure the president's objectives in space are met.""

NASA's deputy administrator Lori Garver told Reuters that, as well as not being in national interests, canceling SpaceX's contacts would probably not be legal. However, she also added that ""a rogue CEO threatening to decommission spacecraft, putting astronauts' lives at risk, is untenable.""

GOP Tax Bill:

Congressional Republicans are siding with Donald Trump in the messy divorce between the president and Elon Musk, an optimistic sign for eventual passage of a tax cut bill at the root of the two billionaires' public feud.

Lawmakers are largely taking their cues from Trump and sticking by the $3 trillion bill at the center of the White House's economic agenda. Musk, the biggest political donor of the 2024 cycle, has threatened to help primary anyone who votes for the legislation, but lawmakers are betting that staying in the president's good graces is the safer path to political survival.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

In this article

Tesla stock climbed about 5% Friday after threats and insults between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump fueled a $152 billion rout for the company's market cap a day earlier.

""I think the real story here is the investor base of Tesla literally doesn't care about anything,"" Josh Brown,  CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management and CNBC PRO contributor, told CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" Friday. ""This is still a nothing matters stock.""

Analysts cited a Politico report that Trump had scheduled a call Friday with Musk to broker a truce. However, a senior White House official told NBC News Friday that Trump is ""not interested"" in a call with Musk.

""Musk needs Trump and Trump needs Musk for many reasons and these two becoming friends again will be a huge relief for Tesla shares,"" wrote Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives in a note Friday morning. ""We will be monitoring the situation closely today but we believe Tesla shares are way oversold on this news.""

Musk spent several days attacking the president's signature tax and spending bill, calling it a ""disgusting abomination,"" after the Tesla chief's tenure as head of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency came to an end last week.

The war of words between Musk and Trump erupted Thursday as Trump addressed Musk's criticism directly.

""I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot,"" Trump said, adding that Musk was upset about the exclusion of EV credits in the budget bill.

Musk reacted in real-time to the president's jabs, and the tone escalated.

""Without me, Trump would have lost the election,"" Musk posted on X. ""Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate.""

Musk later indicated that Trump should be impeached and claimed the president ""is in the Epstein files,"" referring to records pertaining to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Trump has denied any involvement in Epstein's criminal behavior, and Musk provided no evidence to back up the claim.

Trump took to his own social media platform, Truth Social, to respond.

""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,"" Trump wrote. ""I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!""

Tesla shares slide throughout the public clash, closing down 14% and putting the company's market cap below the $1 trillion benchmark.

Follow:


            A young Tibetan controversially appointed by China's atheist Communist Party as the second-highest spiritual leader in Tibetan Buddhism has pledged to make the religion more Chinese.
    


            Gyaltsen Norbu was installed by Beijing as the 11th Panchen Lama in 1995 in defiance of the religion's highest authority the Dalai Lama, whose pick for the role — a six-year-old boy — has since vanished from public view. China has yet to reveal any information on the whereabouts of the missing boy.
    


            The Beijing-appointed Panchen Lama is dismissed as an imposter by many Tibetans at home and in exile, but he is often quoted in China's state-run media toeing the Communist Party's line and praising its policies in Tibet.
    


            In a rare meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing on Friday, Gyaltsen Norbu vowed to make his own contributions to promoting ethnic unity and systematically advancing “the sinicization of religion,” state news agency Xinhua reported.
    


            The remarks refer to a sweeping campaign unleashed by Xi with an aim to purge religious faiths of foreign influence and align them more closely with traditional Chinese culture – and the authoritarian rule of the officially atheist Communist Party.
    


            Gyaltsen Norbu also vowed to keep Xi's teachings firmly in mind, resolutely support the party's leadership and firmly safeguard national unity and ethnic solidarity, according to Xinhua.
    


            He was told by Xi to carry forward the “patriotic and religious traditions” of Tibetan Buddhism and contribute to fostering “a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation,” Xinhua reported.
    


            The meeting comes on the 30th year of the disappearance of the Dalai Lama appointed Panchen Lama.
    


            Following the 1989 death of the 10th Panchen Lama, the second most important figure in Tibetan Buddhism, the Dalai Lama named Tibetan child Gedhun Choekyi Nyima as his colleague's reincarnation.
    


            But three days after he was chosen, according to the US government, Gedhun and his family were disappeared by the Communist Party, which then appointed an alternative Panchen Lama. Gedhun hasn't been seen in public since.



            In a statement marking that anniversary, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio denounced Chinese authorities for “abducting” him and his family. He called on Beijing to immediately release Gedhun Choekyi Nyima and “stop persecuting Tibetans for their religious beliefs.”
    


            In 2020, the Chinese government publicly acknowledged the fate of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima for the first time, describing him as “a college graduate with a job,” and that neither he nor his family wished to be disturbed in their “current normal lives.”
    


            Meanwhile, Gyaltsen Norbu has occupied an increasingly high-profile role since becoming an adult, joining a top Chinese political body, often appearing at important events in Beijing and meeting large crowds in the Tibetan regions of China.

            The contested appointment of the Panchen Lama is widely seen by experts and the Tibetan exile community as Beijing's attempt to pave the way for the passing – and reincarnation – of the Dalai Lama, who has lived in exile since fleeing to India following a failed Tibetan uprising against Communist Party rule in 1959.
    


            For decades, the Dalai Lama has been a persistent thorn in Beijing's side as he commanded the loyalty of many Tibetan people from exile and kept their struggle for greater autonomy alive on the world stage. Chinese officials have condemned the Nobel Peace Prize laureate as a “separatist” and a “wolf in monk's robes.”
    


            The Dalai Lama has said he will release details about his succession around his 90th birthday in July. In his latest book, “Voice for the Voiceless,” the Dalai Lama said his successor will be born in the “free world,” which he described as outside China.
    


            Beijing has insisted it will choose his successor – as well as the reincarnation of all Tibetan Buddhist lamas, but the Dalai Lama and his supporters have said that any successor named by China would not be respected.

Ukrainian forces struck multiple Russian airfields and military facilities overnight on June 6, hours before Russia launched one of its heaviest aerial assaults of the war, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported.

Ukrainian strikes reportedly targeted Engels and Dyagilevo airfields — two key hubs for Russia's long-range bomber fleet, as well as logistics sites in Russia's Kursk Oblast.

Hours after the strikes, Russia attacked Ukraine with 452 drones and 45 missiles, killing at least five people and injuring 73 in one of the largest attacks of the full-scale war.

Engels-2 air base, located in Saratov Oblast, nearly 600 kilometers (370 miles) from Ukraine's front lines, hosts Russia's Tu-95, Tu-22M3, and Tu-160 bombers — aircraft regularly used in missile attacks on Ukrainian cities. 

Ukraine's General Staff said a strike ignited large fires at the facility, hitting at least three fuel tanks. Footage and local reports confirmed a significant blaze and numerous explosions in the area.

Saratov Governor Roman Busargin acknowledged a fire at an unspecified ""industrial enterprise"" and damage from drones to a residential building. No casualties were reported.

The Dyagilevo airfield in Ryazan Oblast, home to air refueling tankers and bomber escort fighters, was also targeted. The General Staff reported fire damage in the area, with Russian air defense activity and explosions recorded. Results of the strike are still being assessed.

Ukraine also claims to have struck a logistics center tied to the 30th Motorized Rifle Regiment of Russia's 72nd Division near Kulbaki in Kursk Oblast.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed that 174 Ukrainian drones were intercepted overnight across 12 regions of Russia and occupied Crimea. 

""Strikes on military infrastructure will continue until the Russian Federation's armed aggression against Ukraine is completely stopped,"" Ukraine's General Staff said.

The latest wave of Ukrainian strikes underscores Kyiv's evolving long-range strike capability, as well as its efforts to preemptively degrade Russian assets used in air assaults. 

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on June 1 launched Operation Spiderweb, a daring mass drone attack that damaged 41 Russian heavy bombers at four key airfields throughout the country. 

The operation reportedly targeted A-50, Tu-95, and Tu-22 M3 planes parked at the Belaya, Diaghilev, Olenya, and Ivanovo air bases, causing approximately $7 billion in damage.

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke with Prime Minister Mark Carney on Friday.Stringer/Reuters

Prime Minister Mark Carney is defending his decision to invite India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the G7 summit in Alberta this month despite an ongoing investigation into the South Asian country's involvement in the 2023 slaying of Canadian Hardeep Singh Nijjar.

Mr. Carney's predecessor Justin Trudeau publicly accused India of a role in the gangland-style murder of Mr. Nijjar, a prominent advocate for a separate state for Sikhs in the Indian state of Punjab. India has denied the allegation.

The Prime Minister declined to answer a question Friday on whether he believed Mr. Modi was involved in the death of Mr. Nijjar, who was shot dead outside a Sikh gurdwara in Surrey, B.C. “There is a legal process that is literally under way and quite advanced in Canada, and it's never appropriate to make comments with respect to those legal processes,” he said.

He offered a rationale for inviting Mr. Modi even though last year the RCMP said publicly it has strong evidence that the “highest levels” of the Indian government were involved in orchestrating a campaign of violence and intimidation on Canadian soil. 

Explainer: The G7 summit is being held just outside Calgary. Here's who will be there and what these meetings achieve

Mr. Carney said it makes sense that India as the most populous country in the world, with the fifth largest economy, should be present at this year's G7 where leaders will hold discussions on energy security, critical minerals and infrastructure projects in the developing world.

“My role as chair of the G7 it is important to invite the most important countries to attend to talk about important issues such as energy, artificial intelligence, critical minerals, and India is really at the very center of global supply chains,” Mr. Carney said.

There's been no public indication that India has agreed to co-operate in Canada's investigation of the Nijjar slaying. However, the Prime Minister said Friday both countries have resolved to “continued law enforcement dialogue.” Mr. Carney did not say if that included the Nijjar killing.

Mr. Modi indicated in a post on X Friday that he would be attending the G7 in Kananaskis June 15-17.

Canada-India relations suffered a major rupture in September, 2023, when Mr. Trudeau told Parliament that Canada's national security apparatus has reason to believe “agents of the Indian government” killed Mr. Nijjar.

Twenty months after this diplomatic breach, Canada's and India's ambassador-level posts in each other's country are still vacant.

Mr. Modi said in his post that he congratulated Mr. Carney on his election win.

“As vibrant democracies bound by deep people-to-people ties, India and Canada will work together with renewed vigour, guided by mutual respect and shared interests,” he wrote. “Look forward to our meeting at the Summit.”

The Canada-based World Sikh Organization (WSO) condemned Mr. Carney's decision to invite Mr. Modi to the G7 despite India's alleged role in the death of Mr. Nijjar. 

“For Sikhs in Canada, this is a betrayal, not just of our community, but of core Canadian values,” WSO President Danish Singh said in a statement. “Prime Minister Carney's decision to invite Narendra Modi, while India continues to deny any role in the assassination of Bhai Hardeep Singh Nijjar and refuses to cooperate with Canadian authorities, is both shameful and dangerous.”

“We would never welcome leaders from Russia, China, or Iran under such circumstances. Yet India has done far more on Canadian soil in terms of foreign interference and transnational repression, including orchestrating murders, and is being rewarded with a red carpet welcome.”

Canada-India relations will be repaired ‘one step at a time': Anita Anand

Last week, Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand said Canada looks forward to rebuilding ties with India as part of an effort to diversify trade away from the United States – even as the RCMP investigation into Mr. Nijjar's murder continues.

The Carney government, which also talked of repairing ties with China Thursday, is strengthening overseas relations as ties with the United States erode under U.S. President Donald Trump.

Ms. Anand last week said the renewal of ties with India will take place “one step at a time.” 

“As I mentioned, the rule of law will never be compromised, and there is an ongoing investigation regarding the case that you mentioned,” she said in an interview, referring to Mr. Nijjar's murder. “At the same time, we are looking forward to continuing to build this partnership, and we're looking forward to that as a government – it's not just me.”

“It's part of the process of diversifying our relationships and building relationships around the world.”

Mr. Carney won April's federal election after campaigning on a plan to reduce the country's dependency on the United States, which he painted as increasingly unreliable.

Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada, welcomed Mr. Modi's inclusion at the G7 leaders' summit.

He said there is a clear opportunity ahead for Canada and India to reset their relationship and determine next steps in the coming months. 

“On the global front, it's important that democracies work in concert at a challenging and uncertain time like this,” Mr. Hyder said.

US President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, who just months ago celebrated the Republican candidate's election victory together, have exchanged insults, accusations and threats.

Their relationship has followed a familiar trajectory: over the years, many of Trump's associates have gone from working closely with him to a public falling out.

This is how the tech entrepreneur threw his wealth and clout behind Trump's re-election campaign, took a proverbial chainsaw to perceived excesses in government spending, and later turned against the president and his signature spending bill.

Musk first unequivocally endorsed Trump for a second term in July 2024, after a shooter almost killed the GOP contender during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. In the months leading up to the election, he spent an estimated $200 million securing the candidate's victory through a political action committee he created for the purpose. But their relationship stretches back years.

During Trump's first term in office, which began in January 2017, Musk sat on a White House business advisory group, but quit later that year after the administration decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.

In 2022, Musk said it was time for Trump “to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset” and blamed the Democrats for targeting him, arguing they had pushed him to seek office in order to insulate himself from legal problems. The remark reflected the tech entrepreneur's broader dissatisfaction with what he called “the party of division & hate.”

That same year, Musk purchased Twitter, a social media platform that at the time was the de facto public square for US national politics, whose management he accused of stifling conservative voices.

The new owner reinstated Trump's account, which had been suspended in January 2021 for allegedly posing a risk of incitement of violence in the wake of the Capitol Hill riot, and otherwise changed moderation rules. Critics claim Musk saturated the platform with “misinformation” and hate speech.

Musk also blasted then-President Joe Biden's immigration policy, which he said amounted to keeping the southern border “open” and decried failing to repatriate illegals as a ploy to increase the Democratic Party electoral base. Trump made the promise of mass deportation of such immigrants a key part of his campaign.

In January 2025, Musk was appointed to lead the newly-created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the Trump administration, with a mandate to review federal spending and cut exuberant or suspicious projects.

Critics called Musk's approach reckless and damaging, while Trump declared DOGE a “very big success” and an example of his administration's no-nonsense treatment of red tape.

In February, Musk gladly brandished a chainsaw at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), which had been given to him by Argentina's President Javier Milei, a similarly-minded politician, as a symbol of the efforts.

Musk got embroiled in several controversies while working for the government. Claims that he threw a Nazi salute during an inauguration event were largely written off by the president's supporters as partisan attacks. Musk's criticisms of senior officials in countries which were traditional US allies, including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Germany's now-former Chancellor Olaf Scholz, were downplayed by officials.

Behind closed doors, however, he reportedly clashed with senior cabinet members. In March, the New York Times claimed that the DOGE chief had criticized US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy for not firing enough staff members in their departments. Trump dismissed the report as “fake news.”

Nevertheless, signs of the growing rift mounted. Days before his seemingly amicable departure from DOGE, Musk told CBS News he was “disappointed” with the “big, beautiful bill” – the centerpiece of Trump's second term agenda currently pending approval by the Senate. This week, Musk derided the spending proposal as a “massive, outrageous, pork-filled … disgusting abomination.”

The Trump-Musk “bromance” seemingly imploded over several hours on Thursday, after the president accused the Tesla CEO of going after the legislation out of personal spite. “He only developed the problem when he found out we're gonna have to cut the EV mandate,” Trump told journalists in the Oval Office.

The billionaire pushed back on X, accusing Trump of lying about the bill and lacking gratitude for his backing on the campaign trail, which Musk asserted secured the victory. Trump doubled down on his Truth Social platform, declaring that Musk “just went CRAZY” and threatening to withdraw government contracts from his businesses.

In response, Musk accused Trump in an X post on Thursday of covering up his alleged complicity in the sex offences of late financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, suggesting the president could be impeached for it. He also threatened to jeopardize NASA's manned space program by decommissioning the Dracon family of spacecraft operated by his company SpaceX. Musk has since indicated that he would be taking a couple of days to cool off, while White House insiders reportedly suggested a possible truce was being arranged.

Some Democratic officials have suggested that Musk could switch sides, while others expressed a sense of satisfaction at his downfall. Congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez claimed “these two huge egos were not longed for being together in this world as friends,” and the breakup was long overdue.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk spent some $300 million on Donald Trump's campaign, gaining unprecedented access to the Republican president's administration. What does their public row mean for Musk's empire?

Once a vocal critic of Donald Trump during his 2016 United States election campaign, Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, pivoted from his Democratic Party roots to embrace Trump's policies during the Republican's second term.

Frustrated by Obama-era regulations stifling his ventures, Musk embraced Trump's agenda of tax cuts and deregulation.

Their bond grew from mutual respect to a robust political alliance, which saw Musk last year back Trump's reelection campaign to the tune of nearly $300 billion (€263 billion).

When Trump returned to the White House in January, the world's richest man took on an advisory role in the administration, leading the controversial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Tasked with slashing public spending, Musk's role stirred controversy, impacting Tesla's stock price and auto sales. After months of pressure from investors, Musk agreed last month to scale back his work in Trump's government.

On Thursday, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the ""The Dogefather,"" Musk was given an initially cordial farewell by the president in the Oval Office.

But Trump could not contain his frustration at Musk's earlier criticism of his administration's sweeping tax and spending bill, which the Tesla founder called fiscally reckless and a ""disgusting abomination.""

After Musk then accused the US president of alleged ties to child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the news conference ended with Trump threatening to revoke Musk's government contracts, which could cost his business empire billions of dollars.

Over the next few hours, the row spilled over to social media, where both men repeated their White House remarks, prompting the SpaceX owner to announce an immediate decommissioning of its Dragon spacecraft, before appearing to back down.

Tesla stock lost about $150 billion in market value on Thursday — the largest single-day decline in its history. The stock closed down over 14%.

However, news outlet Politico reported Friday that the two men were scheduled to speak later in the day in the hope of defusing the situation, which caused a sharp reversal in the stock's fortunes. Tesla stock was up 5% in pre-market trade.

However, a White House official said later Friday that Trump had no plans for any call, adding that he may get rid of his Tesla bought in March in a show of support against Musk in the face of anti-Tesla protests.

Tesla shares have been on a wild rollercoaster ride this year after a strong performance around the US election. Having peaked at $428 in January, shares in the electric vehiclemaker plummeted by almost half in March as investors reacted negatively to Musk's involvement in the Trump administration.

Tesla stock then rallied when Trump paused his unprecedented tariffs on the rest of the world and after US regulators eased rules on self-driving vehicles.



The public spat, as well as Trump's budget plans, have left the fortunes of Musk's companies hanging in the balance.

Tesla, Musk's most profitable firm, could be severely impacted by Trump's plans to cut a subsidy on new electric vehicles that is worth up to $7,500 for buyers.

Despite Musk's aggressive criticism and lobbying by Tesla, Trump plans to eliminate the credit by the end of the year, seven years before it was due to expire.

News agency Bloomberg cited JP Morgan analysts as saying that the cut would reduce Tesla's full-year profit by $1.2 billion. Cuts to state-level credits could further impact the EV maker's bottom line this financial year.

It could, however, encourage EV buyers to bring forward their plans and spur demand for Tesla's vehicles in the short term.

Tesla is already being impacted by Trump's tariffs as the firm relies on Chinese parts for its Cybercab robotaxi and Semi electric truck.

However, it is unclear whether Trump can unilaterally make good on his threat to tear up federal contracts with Musk's firms like SpaceX.

Since 2000, SpaceX has received more than $22 billion in contracts from the US Defense Department and space agency NASA.

If Trump were to terminate the contracts, it would have a huge financial impact on SpaceX and disrupt the US government's space ambitions.

SpaceX's Crew Dragon is currently the only US spacecraft certified to carry crew to the International Space Station (ISS).

Any ending of Pentagon contracts involving Musk's Starlink satellite internet service would also be a lose-lose for both Musk and the government.

Starlink provides broadband services to rural areas. Terminals are also deployed on US military bases, ships, aircraft, and armored vehicles. The satellite internet service is often used for disaster response.

How do you keep calm in times of crisis? What do people need to be happy? Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius is often quoted online for answers. This once-powerful man would have preferred to be a philosopher.

""Look within. Within is the fountain of good, and it will ever bubble up, if thou wilt ever dig.""

Wise statements like this can be found in the ""Meditations"" of Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (121-180 C.E.). He had never intended these reflections for publication, having written them purely for himself, but they have become some of the most widely read writings after the Bible and the Quran. A bestseller, so to speak, which has been translated into numerous languages worldwide.

Known today as a philosopher-king, Marcus Aurelius ruled at a time marked by crises and catastrophes. He ascended to the throne in 161 C.E., just a few years before the Marcomannic Wars (166-180 C.E.) — the Marcomanni were Germanic tribes — which would shake the Roman Empire to its foundations. In addition, there were economic problems, social tensions and the spread of the Antonine Plague, a form of smallpox, throughout the Roman emperor's territory.

Equanimity — that was one of the basic principles of Marcus Aurelius, who was a great fan of the Stoics, an ancient school of philosophy founded by the Greek Zeno of Citium in 300 B.C.E.

Marcus Aurelius wanted to be a good ruler, but what is good governance?

That question, which remains relevant to this day, was of great concern to him, as reflected in his ""Meditations.""

But his contemporaries would never have read his writings, according to archaeologist Marcus Reuter, director of the Rheinisches Landesmuseum in Trier. ""The Romans also never saw him as a philosopher-king. His writings were never made public during his lifetime. He wrote for himself, in the quiet of his room in the evening.""

Aurelius only acquired the image of the philosopher-king after the publication of his ""Meditations"" in the 15th or 16th century.

Reuter and historian Viola Skiba, director of the Stadtmuseum Simeonstift in Trier, have co-curated a joint exhibition, in each of their institutions, on Marcus Aurelius, set to run from June 15 to November 23, 2025. Skiba says the themes of the exhibition are more current than they had anticipated. Particularly in these crisis-ridden and polarized times, the question of what good leadership looks like has taken on a new urgency. At the same time, the question is as old as human history itself, and was clearly a focus in the ancient world.

What, according to Marcus Aurelius, distinguishes good governance? ""Basically, it is guided by the cardinal virtues of antiquity,"" says Skiba. Those desirable virtues include wisdom, justice, prudence and moderation. A key concept is the ""orientation towards the common good,"" acting in a way that truly benefits the community as a whole. ""This is, so to speak, also what separates a good ruler from a bad one according to [the Greek philospher] Aristotle."" 

Reuter adds that Marcus Aurelius would most likely have considered Donald Trump ""not a good leader, and certainly not a role model.""

But of course, Marcus Aurelius was a product of his time, who grew up within the social structures of antiquity. ""There was slavery, and not even Marcus Aurelius wanted to abolish it,"" according to Reuter. The emperor also did not question ""that there were people with and without Roman civil rights, or that women did not have the same rights as men.""

From today's perspective, it may also seem odd to consider as virtuous an emperor who waged brutal wars. ""According to ancient standards, the emperor was expected to ensure the security of the empire and protect its inhabitants — even by very brutal means if necessary,"" says Reuter.

""He was extensively involved in court cases. He endeavored to pass just judgments, and always put the interests of the state first,"" adds Reuter.

The construction of the Porta Nigra in Trier — today the city's famous landmark — can also be traced back to Marcus Aurelius. It was part of the city wall that Aurelius had built to protect its citizens.

 

Aphorisms like the above can seem like mockery coming from a wealthy emperor, but they were meant sincerely. Indeed, Marcus Aurelius cultivated a rather modest lifestyle and even had imperial household items — his private assets — auctioned off when the state was in financial crisis. ""As far as I know, no Roman emperor before or after him did that,"" says Reuter.

He also apparently spent a lot of time pondering the meaning of life, which is presumably the reason so many young people nowadays are interested in him and his writings. In Reuter's estimation, ""his 'Meditations' are a little treasure trove containing something to address nearly every situation in life.""

The archaeologist points out that Marcus Aurelius' writings don't lend themselves to being read from front to back, but are well-suited to dipping into to find inspiration. They are, after all, the private musings of someone who spent time thinking about what was truly important in life. So it's small wonder that quotes by the Roman emperor can be found all over social media.

The exhibition in Trier builds on this contemporary interest in Marcus Aurelius and the topics that occupied him. It's designed to inspire visitors from all over the world to reflect on themselves, society, and what a long-ago Roman emperor still has to say to us today. Or, as Viola Skiba puts it, ""Every society is based on individuals, and if each and every individual asks themselves these philosophical and political questions, then it also works as a whole.""

Donald Trump is planning to sell the White House Tesla amid a bitter row with Elon Musk.

Mr Trump purchased a red Model S Tesla in March when Mr Musk brought a range of his fleet to the White House for the president to peruse.

The purchase was a show of support for Mr Musk's business at a time when his shares were tumbling, with Mr Trump declaring the car a “great product” and “as good as it gets”.

However, a senior administration official told NewsNation that Mr Trump now plans to sell or give away the car, which is currently parked at the White House and used by staff.

Mr Musk spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the president's re-election campaign before assuming a senior role in his government but the two men have bitterly fallen-out, primarily because of disagreements over Mr Trump's tax-and-spend bill.

On Thursday, Mr Trump suggested the Tesla billionaire had developed “Trump derangement syndrome” while Mr Musk suggested he should be impeached and will cause the US to go into recession.

The president continued the war of words on Friday when he claimed Mr Musk had “lost his mind”, despite officials claiming he was “over” their public spat.

Thanks for following our live coverage. This blog is now closed.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, the firebrand Republican congresswoman, has hit out at Elon Musk for “lashing out on the internet”.

The intervention is significant from the Georgia representative, who as chair of the House of Representatives' Doge subcommittee would in theory be one of Mr Musk's closest allies in Congress.

Referring to Mr Musk spending close to $300 million on Mr Trump's re-election campaign, she said: “Every single one of those votes, no matter how much money they have, matter... whether it was $1 or 100 donated, or hundreds of millions of dollars donated, I think they're all the same.

“And I think each voice really matters. 

“And I don't think lashing out on the internet is the way to handle any kind of disagreement, especially when you have each other's cell phones.”

Donald Trump has said Elon Musk has “lost his mind” in an escalation of his public war of words with the tech billionaire.

Asked about reports of a scheduled call with Mr Musk later today, Mr Trump told ABC News: “You mean the man who has lost his mind?”

The US president added that he was “not particularly” interested in speaking with Mr Musk, with whom he has clashed over his tax and spend bill.

The comments came after White House sources told The Telegraph that Mr Trump was “over it” and wanted to move on from the public spat, which ended with Mr Musk calling for the president's impeachment.

A Trump official said: “I don't think the president is interested in speaking to Elon right now. But he's also over it and wants to stay focused on passing the bill.

“That was his mindset when he left last night, and that's his mindset moving forward.”

Other than Mr Trump's comments earlier today - calling Mr Musk “crazy” - there is no sign of the feud continuing on social media...at least for now. 

The US president's last post on his Truth Social was about the economy. 

“GREAT JOB NUMBERS, STOCK MARKET UP BIG! AT THE SAME TIME, BILLIONS POURING IN FROM TARIFFS!!!” he posted. 

Mr Musk, meanwhile, congratulated Tesla's Berlin team after it produced its eight millionth vehicle in the German capital. 

Congratulations Tesla Giga Berlin team!! https://t.co/IpekyFE39y

If you're just catching up on the latest between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, here's where things stand...

Americans should continue to put their trust in Donald Trump, who “continues to beat expectations”, the White House has said.

Karoline Leavitt, Mr Trump's press secretary, posted figures on X showing that the US economy added 139,000 jobs in May, which was more than expected.

“President Trump's American First Economic Agenda has created a BOOMING economy - jobs are up, unemployment is down, wages are increasing, and inflation is dead.

“More than 139,000 good jobs were added to the private sector in May, all accounted for by American-born workers. Americans should continue to Trust in President Trump, who continues to beat expectations.”

The row between the President and Elon Musk could also hit the tech billionaire's Starlink internet service.

An offshoot of Mr Musk's SpaceX company,  Starlink, uses satellites to deliver broadband services to areas which would otherwise be off-grid.

The contracts with the Federal government are worth millions of dollars to Mr Musk.

They include a $70 million deal to provide satellite communications to 54  stations used by the  Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard.

Starlink is also used by the Federal Communications Commission to provide rural broadband to 642,000 homes.The company is currently negotiating new contracts with the US Geological Survey, the Army, and the Navy.

Not long ago, Elon Musk was a darling of American progressives.

A visionary bringing electric cars to the people, and voting Democrat for more than two decades.

He then became their self-appointed nemesis, clearing the US government of a “viper's nest of radical-Left Marxists who hate America”.

So, how did Musk make the political voyage from Left to Right in record time?

Mike Johnson, speaker of the US House of Representatives, expressed confusion over Elon Musk's criticism of the GOP tax and spending bill and Donald Trump.

Mr Johnson has reportedly been contacting Mr Musk through calls and messages to persuade him to reconsider his stance.

Speaking to reporters, Mr Johnson said he wasn't sure “what has motivated this disturbance to begin, but obviously it's not helpful”.

He added that he would prefer “that policy disputes are not personal”.

“I've tried very hard to speak with Elon over and over, you know, and talk with him about what I believe are misconceptions he has about this bill and what it is,” Mr Johnson said.

An online poll has shown that Americans are largely siding with President Trump over Elon Musk, although the vast majority preferred to stay out of the dispute.

When asked by YouGov who they supported - Mr Trump, Mr Musk, or neither - 28 per cent chose Mr Trump, 8 per cent backed Mr Musk, and 52 per cent sided with neither.

Amongst Republicans, support for Mr Trump was overwhelming at 71 per cent, compared to just 6 per cent for Mr Musk, with 12 per cent choosing neither. 

Democrats mostly favoured neither, but amongst those who picked a side, 11 per cent supported Mr Musk versus 4 per cent for Mr Trump.

Senior Russian officials have made digs at both Donald Trump and Elon Musk, joking about hosting peace talks, while another said Mr Musk should bring his businesses to Russia.

“Elon, don't be upset!” nationalist senator Dmitry Rogozin, who once ran Russia's space programme, wrote on Mr Musk's X social media site. 

“If you encounter insurmountable problems in the US, come to us. Here you will find reliable comrades and complete freedom of technical creativity.”

Dmitry Medvedev, a senior security official and former Russian president, posted: “We are ready to facilitate the conclusion of a peace deal between D and E for a reasonable fee and to accept Starlink shares as payment. Don't fight, guys!”

Margarita Simonyan, one of Russia's most powerful state media executives, mocked it as an example of “modern US political culture”. 

“Sort of like the English Industrial Revolution. Only in reverse,” she added. 

Donald Trump has said that Elon Musk has “a problem” in his latest comments on the feud between them.

“I'm not even thinking about Elon... He's got a problem,” he reportedly told ABC News. “The poor guy's got a problem.”

Mr Trump added: “I won't be speaking to him for a while, I guess, but I wish him well.”

Vice President JD Vance said Donald Trump's dismissal of his former ally Elon Musk from the MAGA circle was neither rash nor ill-planned.

“There are many lies the corporate media tells about President Trump. One of the most glaring is that he's impulsive or short-tempered,” Mr Vance wrote on X

“Anyone who has seen him operate under pressure knows that's ridiculous,” he said. “It's (maybe) the single biggest disconnect between fake media perception and reality.”

Late on Thursday, Mr Vance made his loyalty to Mr Trump clear, saying he was “proud to stand beside him”.

Donald Trump is reportedly considering selling or giving away the red Tesla car he purchased earlier this year, according to a senior White House official.

Mr Trump bought the car during a White House photo-op intended to promote Elon Musk's business.

As of Thursday evening, the vehicle remained parked outside the West Wing.

A planned meeting between US and Chinese officials on trade is expected to take place within seven days, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Friday, a day after President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping spoke.

Readers of The Telegraph have had their say on the public spat between Elon Musk and Donald Trump. You can add your own thoughts at the bottom of this page. 

Yesterday evening, there were signs that Elon Musk and Donald Trump could reconcile after their argument played out across social media.  

Mr Trump projected an air of nonchalance as he spoke about the spat in a phone call last night. “Oh it's okay,” Mr Trump told Politico when asked about the argument. “It's going very well, never done better.”

Mr Musk also appeared agreeable to a truce last night when hedge fund manager Bill Ackman moved to ease tension.“I support @realDonaldTrump and @elonmusk and they should make peace for the benefit of our great country,” Mr Ackman wrote on X.“You're not wrong,” Mr Musk responded. 

Those hopes were dashed when White House sources denied any possibility of a phone call between the pair today. 

The Trump-Musk alliance was always on shaky ground - and now, with a spectacular bang, it has crashed.

But from Mr Trump's relentless need to dominate the spotlight to his history of turning on allies, many say this explosive split was almost inevitable.

Here, The Telegraph's Michael Lind breaks down why their public fallout came as no surprise.

 A bust in honour of Elon Musk was vandalised in Brownsville, Texas, as the feud escalates. 

Quotes from sources close to the White House reveal a tense and uneasy view of the fallout between Donald Trump and Elon Musk.

One insider described Mr Trump as concerned about Mr Musk's mental state, telling POLITICO: “The president is worried Elon is not well… and is just kind of freaking out.”

But even taking this into consideration, the source said Mr Trump's combative nature remains: “He'll punch at whoever punches him if he thinks he needs it.”

Another senior official hinted that the administration is unsurprised that their relationship has suddenly soured.

“Everyone knew this was gonna end badly. We're dealing with someone who is unstable… we saw it coming,” they said.

While the comments offer insight into the workings of their relationship, perhaps more importantly, they could present Mr Musk with an opportunity to back-pedal by attributing his actions to going through a “difficult time”.

The breakdown of Donald Trump's relationship with Elon Musk yesterday resulted in a combined loss of about $21 billion for both men.

Both Mr Trump and Mr Musk oversee vast business empires, and each had a key public company affected by the fallout. 

As their social media feud escalated into personal attacks, investors reacted sharply.

Tesla shares plunged 14.3 per cent, wiping nearly $20 billion off Mr Musk's net worth.

Meanwhile, Trump Media & Technology Group's stock fell 8 per cent, costing Mr Trump around $202 million.

The most significant blow to Mr Trump came from the roughly 10 per cent drop in his Official Trump meme coin, which could have cost him nearly $900 million.

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, has called Elon Musk's behaviour “an unfortunate episode”, adding the Tesla boss is “unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted”.

In a post on X, Ms Leavitt wrote that Donald Trump's “number one focus” is ensuring that the legislation passes smoothly. 

“This is a transformative piece of legislation that delivers on the Make America Great Agenda by delivering the largest tax cuts and border security investments in HISTORY,” she added.

Sweeping cuts introduced by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) will have a lasting impact on foreign aid, global health, and development programmes.

The end of dozens of USAID projects has limited the resources it will spend on disaster relief, food security, and refugee support, worsening crises in vulnerable regions.

Cuts to funding for initiatives like the Global Fund or pandemic preparedness set back efforts to combat infectious diseases, including malaria, tuberculosis, and Covid-19.

The US is also said to be proposing cuts to its flagship anti-HIV programme by almost 40 per cent next year.

The long-running programme is estimated to have saved more than 20 million lives in the past two decades, and is often cited as one of the world's most successful public health schemes.

Experts worry reduced US aid could open the door for rival powers - including China and Russia - to increase their influence through their own investments and aid, reshaping global alliances.

Elon Musk's legal 130-day term as a ‘special government employee' is set to expire today after a controversial stint that will have a lasting impact both in the US and across the world.

Mr Musk's stated goal as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was to slash spending across the board, saving American taxpayers money by ending “waste, fraud, and abuse”.

He claimed he could cut $1 trillion from the federal budget before September 30, but the reported toll is far off that figure.

As of May 26, DOGE's online “wall of receipts” claims estimated savings of $175 billion since the start of Mr Trump's term, averaging $1,086.96 saved per taxpayer.

But analysis by the New York Times has spotted gaping holes in those claims.

This includes counting government contracts not yet awarded, contracts that ended years ago, triple-counting the same savings, and confusing “million” with “billion”.

DOGE has since corrected some of those errors, but many remain, leaving Mr Musk's governmental legacy in murky waters.

Republicans with close ties to Donald Trump might not be as willing to forget Elon Musk's series of sensationalist social media posts against the US president. 

Leading figures have pitched in their thoughts in the hours since the spat began.

“The president treated him almost like a son,” Steve Bannon, a long-time antagonist of Mr Musk, told Playbook yesterday. 

“He invited his family to Christmas dinner. He let him sleep over. He let him walk in and out of meetings. The president went to the max informality to welcome this guy.”

Bannon added: “You're going to tell me we should allow some fucking punk to sit there and say he should be impeached and JD (Vance) should step in? F--- you, dude. We're going to go to f------ war, and I'm going to rip your f------ face off.”

In one of his controversial posts on X, Elon Musk hit out at Donald Trump's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.

Ever since Epstein's crimes first came to light, the internet has been filled with conspiracy theories about Mr Trump's relationship with the convicted paedophile.

Mr Trump and Epstein's friendship stretched back decades: In 1997, the US smiled as he posed for a photograph with his old friend in Palm Beach.

At the time, the pair, who moved in the same wealthy social circles and bonded over their love of beautiful women, had been friends for years.

But when did their friendship begin and what are the finer details?

Read the full story here.

The Kremlin has said it would not get involved in Donald Trump's row with Elon Musk, but was confident that Mr Trump would deal with the situation.

The quarrel between the two was an internal US matter, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said this morning. 

Elon Musk's high-profile support of Donald Trump during his election campaign undoubtedly gave him a boost. 

Early on, Mr Musk offered his support for Mr Trump's policies on business deregulation, space exploration, and economic growth.

He generated high-profile endorsements, leveraging his influence in tech and media circles.

Public comments and interviews saw Mr Musk praise aspects of Mr Trump's agenda, lending credibility to the campaign among voters interested in innovation, space, and technology.

The once-strong alliance between President Trump and Mr Musk is unravelling, with insiders suggesting a breakup is imminent.

Mr Musk's explosive rift with the White House stems from longstanding tensions about his libertarian policies and his unpredictable behaviour, according to sources close to the president.

Interviews with a string of insiders reveal months of concern at Mr Musk's grandstanding behaviour and philosophical differences with people at the heart of the Trump administration.

Our Chief US Correspondent, Rob Crilley, has the full story here.

Mr Trump's new bill marks a major legislative move by the US president. Named the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act”, it encompasses significant tax reforms, spending cuts, and defence allocations.

The bill is the root of the tensions between Mr Musk and Mr Trump, with the Tesla boss claiming it will undo all of the cost-cutting he has initiated during his tenure at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Key provisions include:

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said today that he had “absolutely no doubt” that Mr Trump would keep the United States within the Nato military alliance.

“I have absolutely no doubt that the American government is sticking with Nato,” Mr Merz said in a speech at an entrepreneurs' event just hours after returning from his inaugural trip to Washington.

Tesla shares have risen after news that White House aides had scheduled a call with CEO Elon Musk in an effort to ease tensions.

The stock climbed about 5 per cent in Frankfurt, rebounding after a sharp 14.3 per cent drop in New York on Thursday that wiped out roughly $150 billion in market value.

“It's unlikely that Trump will end subsidies and contracts with Tesla. Those are obviously threats that are unlikely to come into fruition,” Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, told Reuters.

“I don't expect this to blow out into anything more serious than a war of words for a couple of days.”

Welcome to today's live coverage of the spat between Elon Musk and Donald Trump.

For those of you who are just joining us, the argument began yesterday when Mr Musk publicly criticised the US president's new spending bill.

The Tesla boss labelled the legislation a “disgusting abomination” before accusing Mr Trump of being named in documents relating to the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

Mr Musk added that Mr Trump would have lost the election without him and called for him to be impeached.

Mr Trump responded that his former ally was lashing out at his legislation because he did not “get his own way”.

Donald Trump said Elon Musk has “lost his mind” as he attempted to draw a line under a bitter White House feud.

On Friday, the president said he was “not particularly” interested in speaking with Mr Musk after they clashed publicly over his tax and spending bill. 

White House sources told The Telegraph that the president was “over it” and wanted to move on from the public spat, raising hopes of a truce.

Mr Musk had called for Mr Trump to be impeached and linked the president to the late paedophile, Jeffrey Epstein, at the height of a toxic row that played out on the two men's social media platforms.

Mr Musk appeared to climb down late on Thursday night amid reports of a White House call to smooth relations.

Asked if he would get on the phone with Mr Musk, Mr Trump told ABC News: “You mean the man who has lost his mind?”

Mr Trump and Mr Musk have resisted any further public attacks.

A Trump official told The Telegraph: “I don't think the president is interested in speaking to Elon right now. But he's also over it and wants to stay focused on passing the bill.

“That was his mindset when he left last night, and that's his mindset moving forward.”

Insiders told The Telegraph that JD Vance could be positioned as the man to mediate in the feud and act as a bridge between the pair.

Mr Trump is now planning to give away or sell the red Tesla Model S, which he purchased from Mr Musk in March.

It is currently parked at the White House and used by staffers to move around the capital.

Shares of Mr Musk's electric car company tanked by more than 14 per cent on Thursday as investors dumped holdings as the row intensified.

But as tensions cooled on Friday, shares rose 5 per cent in early trading on Wall Street, pushing the company's market value back above $1 trillion.

Since stepping down as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency last week, Mr Musk has trashed Mr Trump's so-called “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill, describing it as a “disgusting abomination” which will increase the national debt.

The bill will end tax breaks for electric vehicles worth billions to his company.

One insider described Mr Trump as concerned about Mr Musk's mental state, telling Politico: “The president is worried Elon is not well… and is just kind of freaking out.”

Another senior official hinted that the administration is unsurprised that their relationship has suddenly soured.

“Everyone knew this was gonna end badly. We're dealing with someone who is unstable… we saw it coming,” they said.

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, called Mr Musk's behaviour “an unfortunate episode”, adding the Tesla boss is “unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted”.

Migrants and ICE agents are being forced to live in shipping containers on a US military base in hazardous conditions.

The Trump administration could have sent eight migrants with deportation orders and the immigration agents who were escorting them to a facility in the U.S. after a federal judge recently barred officials from deporting them to war-torn South Sudan, where they could face persecution or torture.

Instead the administration sent them to U.S. Naval Base Camp Lemonnier in the East African country of Djibouti, where a court filing on Thursday said they face illness, the threat of rocket fire from nearby Yemen, temperatures that soar past 100°F daily, and rancid smoke from nearby burn pits where human waste and trash are incinerated.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, blamed U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy for “stranding” the 13 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and eight detainees at the naval base, where they have been housed since late May in a metal shipping container converted into a conference room with just six bunk beds.

The administration has frequently attacked judges for issuing rulings that have interfered with President Donald Trump's ability to carry out his anti-immigration agenda.

But Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, pointed to court transcripts that showed the Trump administration had requested the migrants and agents be sent to Camp Lemonnier.

“No one asked them to do and no court order forces them to do it,” said Reichlin-Melnick Thursday.

In a court transcript, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign told Murphy that “bringing them back would be a much broader remedy than necessary” and suggested the detainees could have a “reasonable fear interview where they are” in Djibouti to determine if they had a credible fear of persecution or torture if they were deported. Murphy had instructed officials to arrange reasonable fear interviews when he ruled in May that they could not be sent to South Sudan.

This is a LIE. It was ICE which made the decision to hold the men at that base. No one asked them to do and no court order forces them to do it.In fact, it was ICE who ASKED THE JUDGE for permission to hold the men in Djibouti! Here's the transcript from the court hearing. https://t.co/J8FOAAB7ib pic.twitter.com/op1qimESi7

“The judge did NOT require that anyone be ‘stranded' anywhere,” said Reichlin-Melnick. “In fact, it was the Trump administration that asked the judge for permission to hold the men in Djibouti! ICE could literally bring the men to any other U.S. base (or back to the U.S.) at any time!”

Murphy's ruling in May interrupted a deportation flight carrying the migrants — who have been convicted of crimes and are from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan, and Vietnam — to South Sudan.

The judge said the flight violated his previous order from April 18, which prohibited the administration from sending immigrants to third countries without providing them a chance to request humanitarian protections. That ruling was underpinned by the Convention Against Torture, which bars governments from deporting people to countries where they could be face torture.

“The judge gave the government a choice as to how to remedy the government's violation of the court's order — either return them and comply with the order in the United States or comply with the order overseas,” Trina Realmuto, a lawyer for the immigrants, told The Intercept. “The government opted to comply overseas after telling the court that they had the ability to do so. This is a situation the government both created and can remedy if it so chooses.”

The court filing on Thursday by Mellissa Harper of the Office of Refugee Resettlement described how within 72 hours of arriving at the makeshift detention facility in Djibouti, the agents and migrants began to suffer from symptoms for bacterial respiratory infections, including “coughing, difficulty breathing, fever, and achy joints.”

The filing explained that they are unable to get tested to determine what the illness is, and there is only a small supply of inhalers, Tylenol, eye drops, and nasal spray to treat the symptoms.

Based on what was described, Politico's Kyle Cheney asked: “Why is the Trump administration forcing them to stay there?”

“ICE's claims of difficulties here are ENTIRELY self-inflicted,” said Reichlin-Melnick. “THEY asked the judge for permission to hold the men in Djibouti. The plaintiffs wanted the men brought back here. I have sympathy for the low-level officers stuck there, but it's ALL their bosses' fault.”

The administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay Murphy's order requiring screenings for the migrants, claiming that ruling violated officials' authority to deport immigrants to third countries if their home countries won't take them back.

But in the case of at least one of the migrants, Jesus Munoz Gutierrez, the government of his home country of Mexico was not informed that he had been sent to Djibouti.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested last month that Gutierrez could be repatriated if U.S. followed protocols to send him back to Mexico.

Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director for Detention Watch Network, told Newsweek that the administration's insistence on detaining the migrants in a shipping container at Camp Lemonniere is “the latest move in Trump's shocking expansion of third country deportations.”

“By expelling people out of sight and out of mind to remote prisons and war-torn, unstable countries,” said Ghandehari, “the Trump regime is attempting to normalize the offshoring of immigration detention and third country deportations as a new and expanded model of incarceration and deportation.”

Ghandehari added that “the use of shipping containers to detain people is heinous and enraging — and coupled with the extreme heat, disease, and threats of rocket attacks in Djibouti, can be deadly.”

            The National Hurricane Center is “fully staffed” and any suggestion that the Trump administration fired meteorologists at the National Weather Service is “fake news,” “preposterous and silly,” Commerce Sec. Howard Lutnick testified to Congress this week.
    


            But the administration did fire meteorologists, and the nation's top hurricane forecasting office is not fully staffed as the season is underway.
    


            The NHC, like many other parts of the NWS, has a staffing shortfall currently, with five vacancies at the center in Miami, including at least four meteorologists.
    


            None of the NHC positions can be filled due to the federal hiring freeze, though the NWS was able to get an exemption for 126 mission-critical vacancies at other forecast offices around the country.
    


            The critical staffing issues — which have meant some forecast offices are no longer monitoring the weather 24/7 or launching twice-daily weather balloons — have raised concerns that forecast accuracy will suffer during this hurricane season.
    


            “We are fully, fully staffed. There are no openings on the National Hurricane Center, zero. It is fully staffed,” Lutnick said before a Senate appropriations subcommittee during hearings on the Commerce Department budget on Wednesday.
    


            Lutnick claimed again on Thursday the NHC is “fully staffed,” and falsely stated local weather service forecast offices are fully staffed in an appearance before the House Appropriations Committee.
    


            “It is fake news and inappropriate to suggest a single meteorologist or hydrologist was fired,” Lutnick said. “That is preposterous and silly.”
    


            The Trump administration cut about 100 jobs at the NWS, including meteorologists and hydrologists, according to a fact sheet from Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell's office.
    


            The NWS lost even more meteorologists, including many with decades of experience, from early retirement and other incentives the Trump administration offered in order to reduce the size of the federal workforce.
    


            In total, the agency has lost about 560 employees during the course of the administration, bringing total staffing levels below 4,000, according to the NWS Employees Organization. This is about 18% below “necessary staffing levels” and 33% below “normal” staffing levels.
    


            Many local NWS offices are so short on meteorologists in the wake of Trump administration firings, buyouts and early retirement incentives that the agency has authorized internal transfers to fill critical gaps, in addition to the 126 new hires.
    


            The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reiterated Lutnick's claims in a Thursday statement: “The National Hurricane Center is fully staffed to meet the rigorous demands of the hurricane season,” spokesperson Kim Doster said. “Future positions that may be advertised at the NHC will provide additional support and a deeper bench for our ongoing around-the-clock operations.”
    


            A Commerce Department spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.
    


            The hurricane center's staff website shows all but one of its vacancies, which include at least one hurricane specialist, one hurricane forecaster and two meteorologist/programmers. One staff member who took an early retirement offer is still listed on the roster, according to an NWS employee familiar with the matter.

            Lululemon's stock is on pace for one of its biggest routs in history after the athleisure maker warned that tariffs will dent its profit.
    


            The company cut its full-year guidance citing a “dynamic macroenvironment” that includes a decline in visits to its US stores, the impact of tariffs and and rising competition from other brands, such as Vuori and Alo.
    


            Lululemon (LULU) shares plunged more than 17% Friday, on pace for the stock's worst day in more than five years and its fourth-worst day ever.
    


            “The current tariff paradigm has brought uncertainty into the retail environment,” said CEO Calvin McDonald on a call with analysts Thursday, adding that Lululemon is “definitely not happy where the growth is in the US.”
    


            Following the likes of Nike, Roger Federer-backed On and other similiar brands, Lululemon will also implement “strategic price increases” on a “small portion” of its lineup that includes pricey yoga pants, shoes and shorts, Chief Financial Officer Meghan Frank revealed on the call, but said the price hikes “will be modest in nature.”
    


            The uncertainty around tariffs and consumer spending in the US forced Lululemon to cut its full-year earnings to be between $14.58 to $14.78 per share – a decrease from its previously forecasted $14.95 to $15.15.
    


            Despite that, McDonald said Lululemon is “better positioned than most” to endure and navigate the financial environment because it has $1.3 billion in cash and no debt, “which provides us significant financial flexibility,” he said.
    


            Lululemon is the latest company to reduce its guidance because of the at-least 30% tariffs on imports from China and 10% tariffs from other countries implemented by President Donald Trump.
    


Gap recently said it would could cost the company $100 million to $150 million this year. Sister brand Old Navy also recently launched a new, budget-friendly activewear line this month, that could further pressure Lululemon and attract budget-conscious customers.
    


            Lululemon stock is down about 11% for the year.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) said Thursday that the Democratic Party has trouble making the case that President Donald Trump is corrupt because of the past abuses within its ranks.

“When we talk about Trump's corruption, we're not terribly credible because the American public looks at Democrats and assumes that we're just as corrupt,” Murphy said at a Center for American Progress event in Washington D.C. “And we obviously have had some pretty high-profile problems in our party in the last decade.”

While declining to name specific examples, Murphy said Democrats' 2024 messaging of saving democracy “fell flat” because voters thought “this version of democracy seems rigged” or “only works for the powerful.”

Murphy's comments came at a liberal event in Washington D.C., moderated by Neera Tanden, who is under congressional investigation into whether White House aides covered up former President Joe Biden's health decline. Neither Tanden nor Murphy addressed the controversy, which escalated this week when Trump ordered an investigation into Biden's White House and the House Oversight Committee subpoenaing Biden's doctor.

Murphy, who has become a prominent messenger for the Democratic Party and recently launched a PAC to take on Trump, said that while he had “few quibbles” with Kamala Harris's 2024 campaign, Democrats need to work harder to appeal to young people and men.

“I think young people do fundamentally believe that the Democratic Party is just as corrupt as the Republican Party is, and so while they're noticing Trump's corruption, they don't see it as a reason to come out on the streets, because the alternative doesn't look much better,” Murphy said, citing Trump accepting a luxury jet from Qatar as one example. 

Murphy told the audience that Democrats have a habit of normalizing corrupt government acts by not bringing enough attention to them. He called for “bold” government reforms to restore credibility and to rally around a mission of “unrigging the economy.”

“We probably do need a constitutional amendment to allow us to properly regulate campaign finance,” Murphy said. “And we're not for that because it's hard? Well, that's not a good reason to not be for that.”

Murphy was asked by a college student in the audience about the shift in young men away from liberalism. He criticized the Left for their treatment of male mental health in what he deems as a post-feminism “loss of meaning and purpose.” Democrats have responded that men should “get over it,” and “that's not satisfactory,” Murphy said.

“There is a difference between male identity and female identity and there are still some really important things about masculinity, whether it be physicality or risk-taking, that are still core parts of your identity that you do not have to lose even in a moment when you are competing, rightfully, with women in the workplace,” Murphy said. 

Murphy, who is considered a possible 2028 presidential contender, said Democrats also need to be authentic.

WHITE HOUSE AIDE ACCUSED OF VIOLATING HATCH ACT WITH SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS

“Authenticity of voice is really important for young people. We've got to start talking in an unfiltered way more often,” said Murphy, noting he runs his own social media accounts.

Murphy warned about the “death of democracy” several times and said that it does not happen in one week, but over time, comparing the Trump administration to regimes in Hungary and Turkey.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Nobody wins in the Trump-Musk breakup.

The sun rises every morning. Spring turns to summer. Water is wet. Donald Trump and Elon Musk's relationship has ended with a post about Jeffrey Epstein.

This was inevitable. When Elon Musk attached himself to Trump during Trump's presidential transition last fall, there was great speculation that these two massive egos would, eventually, clash and that their strategic partnership would flame out spectacularly. Many onlookers assumed that Trump would be the one to tire of Musk and that the centibillionaire would fly too close to the sun, becoming too visible in the administration or simply too annoying. During his short time in government, Musk did manage to anger some of Trump's staff and advisers, tank his public reputation with many American voters, and jeopardize the financial health of his electric-vehicle company, Tesla. Still, through all of that, Trump remained remarkably on message and supportive.

Instead it was Musk who fired the first shots, specifically criticisms of the Republicans' budget-reconciliation package (a.k.a. the One Big Beautiful Bill Act). On Tuesday, Musk called the bill a “disgusting abomination,” threatened to politically retaliate against its supporters, and argued it would increase the debt. This led to Trump calling out Musk in an Oval Office meeting today with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, and suggesting that the DOGE figurehead had “Trump derangement syndrome.” The episode that followed has been playing out in reality-TV fashion, with X and Truth Social acting as confessional booths. On X, Musk argued that, “without me, Trump would have lost the election” and accused Trump of “such ingratitude.” On Truth Social, Trump posted that “Elon was ‘wearing thin'” and that, when the president asked Musk to leave, “he just went CRAZY!”

It keeps going. At one point in the afternoon, as if sensing the feud had reached a critical mass of attention, Musk leveled a serious allegation against Trump, posting: “@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!”

Musk had, it seems, kicked off an attentional spectacle without precedent. You have the world's richest man, who is terminally online and whose brain has been addled by social media and, reportedly, other substances. He is one of the most prolific and erratic high-profile posters, so much so that he purchased his favorite social network to mold it in his image. He is squaring off against Trump, arguably the most consequential, off-the-cuff poster of all time and, one must note, the current president of the United States. If it weren't for the other, both men would be peerless in their ability to troll, outrage, and command news cycles via their fragile, mercurial egos.

The point being: If this public fight between Musk and Trump continues, we will witness a Super Bowl of schadenfreude unfold. It's guaranteed to entertain and leave those of us who spectate feeling gross. It is, in other words, the logical endpoint of internet beefs.

This spectacle is tempting to view as a cage match: Two men enter, one man leaves. (Musk, at least, is familiar.)  But that mentality supposes a winner and a loser, and it's worth asking what winning even looks like here. Surely, nobody will come out of this unscathed. Musk's “Epstein files” comment, beyond being an allegation about Trump's relationship with the convicted sex offender and child trafficker, also is a suggestion that Musk might have other dirt on the Trump administration. And the likely loss of Musk's donor money deprives Trump of political leverage. Similarly, Trump has suggested he might strip Musk's companies of their federal funding and subsidies. Tesla's stock has fallen sharply today since Musk began rage-posting against Trump, which suggests there will be real consequences. (Meanwhile, people, including Steve Bannon, are already musing that Musk could get himself deported.)

Consider, though, that in the realm of social media, Musk and Trump both know exactly what they are doing. Musk and Trump are innately attuned to attention and how to attract and wield it. It stands to reason that their interpretation of their past decade online is that public feuding has, essentially, no downside for them. Instead, their perma-arguing, norm-stomping, and general shamelessness have allowed them to become the main characters of a media and political ecosystem that demands constant fodder. Harnessing attention in this way has proved remarkably lucrative. Many credit Trump's initial victory in 2016 to his ability to program the news cycle 140 characters at a time. Meanwhile, some analysts have suggested that Musk's companies are, in their own right, memestocks whose fortunes have risen on the centibillionaire's ability to stay in the spotlight incessantly.

Trump's and Musk's constant provocations and attention seeking have downstream effects, too. Their feuding creates content for others to draft off. The press can cover it, influencers can react to it, politicians can fundraise off it, and all manner of online hustlers can find a way to get in. You can already see the attentional cottage industry hard at work in the Musk-Trump fight as lesser attention merchants try to involve themselves. The podcaster Lex Fridman offered to broker peace on his show while the rapper Kanye West, now known as Ye, stepped in to comment on the chaos. The onetime presidential candidate and third-party champion Andrew Yang seized on Musk's comments to drum up enthusiasm for his pet project. Even the replies became valuable real estate—the long strings of responses to Musk's posts about Trump are littered with advertisements automatically inserted by X. (I saw one for a Trump T-shirt company.) In this way, a Trump-Musk beef is an attentional Big Bang.

In 2020, the blogger Venkatesh Rao wrote a seminal post titled “The Internet of Beefs,” arguing that the structure of social media and our culture-warring has brought about “a stable, endemic, background societal condition of continuous conflict.” In it, he describes the Internet of Beefs as having “a feudal structure,” with charismatic leaders (knights), and anonymous legions of normies (mooks) who have devoted themselves to fight on behalf of these leaders. Rao identifies Trump as an ur-example of a knight, who is able to profit off all of the discord he's helped sow. “For the mook, the conflict is a means to an end, however incoherent,” Rao writes. “For the knight, the conflict is the end. Growing it, and keeping it going, is something like an entrepreneurial cultural capital business model.”

I reread Rao's post as the internet worked itself into a lather over today's fight. Many of the dynamics Rao explained were on display: sycophants lining up to defend Musk or Trump in the hope of getting noticed, various posters (myself included) excitedly or dutifully chronicling the fallout. There is seemingly opportunity everywhere, created by this attentional spectacle. The content is at once depressing and tremendous. At a glance, it looks like everyone's winning.

Of course, nobody is. Rao's most salient point in his essay is that this state of forever beef is a consequence of a societal rot. It's a stalling tactic of sorts, one that prevents us from deciding who we are, both individually and collectively. If that sounds overwrought, it's worth remembering the genesis of Musk and Trump's feud: a funding bill in Congress that would result in roughly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and food stamps, while offering a similar value in tax cuts to high earners. Millions of people could lose their current coverage through the Affordable Care Act if the bill passes. These details are vaporized by the size and scale of this particular beef.

The Trump-Musk feud is not so much a distraction as it is evidence of a societal tendency toward abstraction, even obfuscation. A cage match is easier to watch than a discussion about who deserves benefits and resources. It is certainly more cathartic than an ideological stalemate about the world we want to build. Maybe Trump or Musk will find a way to win or lose their spat. The rest of us, though, will probably not be so lucky, destined instead to spectate fight after fight.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

If America wants a space program, it needs SpaceX.

by  Joshua Keating

Breaking up is hard to do — especially when one party is a billionaire with near-unassailable dominance of the nation's ability to launch things into space, and the other is a president who has staked a significant portion of his legacy on wildly ambitious space-based projects. 

As President Donald Trump and his erstwhile financial backer and former DOGE boss Elon Musk traded blows on social media Thursday, the president at one point posted, “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!” 

This prompted Musk to announce that he was decommissioning SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft, used to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, though he later backed down from the threat.

Trump may soon find, however, that canceling Musk's contracts is a lot harder than selling his Tesla, particularly if he wants to pursue goals like his much-vaunted Golden Dome missile defense project. 

During President Joe Biden's administration, concerns were indeed raised about Musk's lucrative government contracts as well as his access to classified defense information, given his partisan political activities (unusual for a major defense contractor), communications with foreign leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, and ties to the Chinese government. 

But as Vox reported last year, unwinding the government's relationship with Musk's companies is a near impossibility right now, particularly when it comes to SpaceX. The company is simply better at launching massive numbers of objects into space than any of its competitors, and it's not close: SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket was responsible for 84 percent of all satellite launches last year, and the constellation of more than 7,000 Starlink communications satellites accounts for around 65 percent of all operational satellites in orbit. 

The reusable Falcon 9 has become the space launch workhorse of choice for a US military and intelligence community that is ever more dependent on satellites for communications and surveillance.

“If one side or the other severed that relationship, which I don't think is practical, you would very quickly see a backlog of military satellites waiting for launch,” said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow and space defense expert at the American Enterprise Institute. Ambitious plans like the National Reconnaissance Office's ongoing project to launch a constellation of intelligence and surveillance satellites for military use would come to a “screeching halt,” said Harrison.

The US military is also increasingly reliant on SpaceX for mobile internet connectivity via a specialized military-only version of Starlink known as Starshield.

For NASA, the situation is, if anything, even more dire, as shown last March when two US astronauts returned, months late, from the International Space Station on a SpaceX Dragon capsule when problems were detected on the Boeing craft that brought them into orbit on its first ever flight. 

Losing SpaceX “would basically just end the US participation in the space station,” said David Burbach, an associate professor and space policy expert at the Naval War College. 

NASA's space shuttle program shut down in 2011. Boeing's Starliner is probably years from being a viable alternative, and going back to relying on Russian rockets — as the US did for nearly a decade between the end of the Space Shuttle and the advent of Dragon — would probably be a tough sell these days.

Burbach, speaking in his personal capacity, not as a representative of the US military or war college, said such a break “would be the kind of thing that could trigger something truly drastic” such as the White House using the Defense Production Act to take control of the program. It's not surprising Musk quickly backed down from the threat. 

NASA's ongoing Artemis program, which aims to eventually return humans to the Moon and establish a permanent lunar space station, is also heavily dependent on SpaceX's Starship launch vehicle, as are longer term plans for a mission to Mars. These are (or at least were) priorities for the White House: The moon and Mars missions are the only parts of NASA's budget that were increased in the president's recent budget request and the president mentioned planting “the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars” in his inaugural address. 

Mars is, to put it mildly, something of a fixation for Musk, and it's hard to imagine an ongoing US program to get there without his involvement. 

A true Trump-Musk rift would also have implications for “Golden Dome,” the ambitious plan to “protect the homeland” from ballistic missiles, drones, hypersonic cruise missiles, and other aerial threats. 

Plans for Golden Dome are still a little vague and no contracts for its construction have been awarded yet, but SpaceX is reportedly a frontrunner to build a constellation of hundreds of new satellites to detect missile launches and determine if they are headed toward the United States, and possibly even intercept them from space. 

According to Reuters, SpaceX is bidding for portions of the project in partnership with Anduril and Palantir, two other defense tech companies also led by staunch Trump backers. SpaceX's vision for the satellite network reportedly envisions it as a “subscription service,” in which the government would pay for access, rather than owning the system outright, a model that would presumably give Musk much more leverage over how Golden Dome is developed and deployed. 

Critics of the program charge that it is little more than a giveaway to Musk and his allies and Democratic members of Congress have raised concerns about his involvement. 

Advocates for the program, including the Heritage Foundation, which called for investments in ballistic and hypersonic missile defense in its Project 2025 document, have cited SpaceX's success with Starlink and Starshield as proof-of-concept for their argument that deploying a layer of hundreds or thousands of satellites for missile defense is more practical today than it was in the days of President Ronald Reagan's “Star Wars” project.

Even if Golden Dome could be effective, which many doubt, Trump's stated goal of having it operational with “a success rate close to 100 percent” in “less than three years” for around $175 billion (the Congressional Budget Office projects half a trillion dollars) is eyebrow-raising. The Pentagon had already backed away from the three-year timeline even before the president began feuding with the only person in the world who's built anything close to this. 

“Even for SpaceX, it would be challenging,” said Burbach. “I don't think any other company has the capability. They're really out in the lead on assembly line satellite capability.”

Some experts think Golden Dome could be reconfigured with a greater role for land-based radar and interceptors, but this would almost certainly put it short of Trump's expansive vision. As nuclear expert Ankit Panda succinctly put it on Thursday, “Golden Dome is cooked.”

If anyone had a good day on Thursday, it was Musk's fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos. In January, Bezos's space company Blue Origin carried out its first successful launch of New Glenn, a reusable rocket meant to compete with SpaceX's game-changing Falcon for contracts including military launches. The company has also begun launching satellites for its Kuiper communications network, a potential competitor to Starlink. 

Both projects have suffered from long delays and have a long way to go to catch up with Musk's space behemoth, but it's still presumably good news for the company that their main competitor is no longer literally sleeping feet from the White House.

Finding ways to at least encourage competition with Musk, if not cut him loose entirely, would likely have been a priority for a Kamala Harris administration, and may now be one for Trump as well. In response to Vox's questions to the White House about the future of SpaceX's contracts, spokesperson Karoline Leavitt responded in an emailed statement, “President Trump is focused on making our country great again and passing the One Big Beautiful Bill.” SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment. 

Though the two may no longer be speaking, Trump is likely to find it harder than he thinks to get out of the Elon Musk business entirely.

Amazon's retail business is locking down its hiring budget.

According to an internal email, this major part of the company will keep a ""flat headcount opex,"" or operating expenses, this year compared to 2024. Headcount operating expense refers to employee salaries plus their stock-based compensation, the email noted.

The update was shared earlier this year by a finance leader in Amazon's retail unit. This executive explained that any increase in the hiring budget will be ""scrutinized"" and require ""strong supporting reasons."" Business Insider obtained copy of the email.

The retail business is also shifting from managing ""opex targets versus headcount targets,"" according to the email. That likely means managers now have a strict predefined budget allocated to their teams, instead of specific headcount targets when hiring.

These changes only apply to corporate employees in Amazon's retail business. They do not apply to staff working in Amazon warehouses and in the company's cloud division, Amazon Web Services.

The retail organization includes everything from Amazon's online marketplace to its logistics arm and Fresh grocery business.

In an email to BI, Amazon spokesperson Zoe Hoffman said this is the ""responsible way"" to grow a company of its size, and stressed that not growing the hiring budget in a given year is not the same as not hiring. Amazon continues to hire across the company, she added.

""Each of Amazon's many businesses has its own approach to hiring based on its individual needs,"" Hoffman added in a statement. ""However, across the company, we've historically considered both the number of people we need to hire and the associated costs — that is, Operating Expenses or OpEx — of those hiring decisions.""

The move underscores CEO Andy Jassy's relentless push for increased efficiency and higher profit margins.

Since taking over in 2021, he's slashed jobs, revamped pay, trimmed management layers, and even reconsidered Amazon's product listing approach, all in the name of saving money and driving efficiency. Amazon reported record profit of $59 billion in 2024, nearly double its 2023 result.

Holding the hiring budget steady could encourage Amazon retail managers to get smarter and more flexible with compensation expenses. HR professionals say budget-based planning offers tighter financial control than headcount targets. That can be useful in uncertain business environments.

The email said Amazon retail CEO Doug Herrington inspected operating expenses ""very closely throughout the last two years."" The retail organization also recently launched new financial reporting and analysis tools for tracking headcount and operating expenses. Some of the new features include the ability to plan headcount mix by job level, technical skills, and tenure, according to the email.

Amazon has been on a yearslong cost-cutting spree. After booming during the pandemic, the online retail and cloud giant's growth slowed, triggering cutbacks in warehouse growth and the closure of some experimental ventures.

Headcount has also leveled off. The company doubled its workforce to 1.6 million from 2019 to 2021, but that number dipped to 1.55 million last year. Amazon has cut at least 27,000 employees since late 2022.

Managing headcount instead of a hiring budget lets managers bring on high-cost talent without worrying much about salary, David Kryscynski, a human resources professor at Rutgers, told BI. But with a fixed labor budget, he said, managers are more likely to stay within financial limits, either by hiring less or opting for lower-cost candidates.

This model also gives managers more staffing flexibility, said Shaun Pichler, a management professor at California State University, Fullerton. Without headcount targets, they can bring on cheaper contractors or temporary workers. And they're not pressured to spend the full budget, often resulting in leaner teams.

""Tech firms have more widely adopted OpEx targets post-pandemic for largely the same reasons — high labor costs, reduced revenues, and to give managers more flexibility,"" Pichler said.

Amazon's retail arm remains laser-focused on cutting costs. At an internal all-hands meeting earlier this year, retail chief Doug Herrington told employees that belt-tightening would likely extend into 2025, even as the company pours money into major investments elsewhere, BI previously reported.

""We have to keep reducing costs so that we can afford the big investments in big new businesses,"" Herrington said.

Elon Musk's feud with President Donald Trump has officially reached orbit.

Musk said in a post on X Thursday that SpaceX ""will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately"" in light of Trump's statement that floated canceling the billionaire's government contracts and subsidies.

The SpaceX CEO included a screenshot of Trump's earlier Truth Social post, which said terminating Musk's government contracts would be the ""easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars.""

Musk walked that decision back around five hours later.

""This is a shame this back and forth. You are both better than this. Cool off and take a step back for a couple days,"" X user Fab25june wrote on the platform.

""Good advice. Ok, we won't decommission Dragon,"" Musk said.

SpaceX's Dragon spaceships are used to transport NASA astronauts and supplies to and from the International Space Station.

In a statement to Business Insider, Bethany Stevens, NASA press secretary, said: ""NASA will continue to execute upon the President's vision for the future of space. We will continue to work with our industry partners to ensure the President's objectives in space are met.""

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The comments came as the feud between the former allies exploded on Thursday, with Trump and Musk publicly trading insults on their respective social media platforms, Truth Social and X.

Musk's government contracts are worth billions, with SpaceX working closely with NASA. SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft, designed to be reusable, can carry up to seven passengers to and from orbit and is the first private spacecraft to transport humans to and from the ISS, the company says.

Since 2020, NASA has relied on SpaceX's Dragon to transport astronauts to and from orbit. The agency, which retired its space shuttle program in 2011, depended on Russian Soyuz spacecraft for crewed missions prior to partnering with SpaceX.

In 2024, NASA announced SpaceX was awarded a $843 million contract to help decommission the ISS by the early 2030s. The plan involved using a larger, super-powered Dragon spaceship to push the ISS out of orbit, eventually landing in a remote part of the ocean. NASA planned to transition to using privately-owned space stations in the future.

Steve Bannon, who served as the White House chief strategist in Trump's first term, said in an interview Thursday that Trump should act immediately in response to Musk's announcement about decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft.

""President Trump tonight should sign an executive order calling for the Defense Production Act,"" Bannon said, referring to a federal law that grants the president authority to influence or control domestic industry in the name of national defense,""and seize SpaceX tonight before midnight.""

US Cost-of-Living Crisis:

Higher-end pies are still selling, but for lower-income consumers even frozen pizza is becoming a luxury.

With tariffs swinging markets from highs to lows in the span of hours, it helps to look at other indicators to gauge the state of our economy: home sales, the average weekly hours for manufacturing employees, how many dolls a little girl is allowed to get for Christmas. Me? I'm watching pizza sales.

For the longest time, pizza has been the go-to dinner order for anyone looking to feed a family fast and on the cheap. What's often touted as America's favorite food took on another attribute during the pandemic: safe. Domino's Pizza Inc., the largest of the delivery chains, and its smaller rival Papa John's International Inc. each registered double-digit year-over-year same-store sales increases in the US and North America, respectively, in 2020, helped by Covid-19 lockdowns. Pizza Hut finally saw that kind of lift in the first quarter of 2021, by which time inflation had started to bubble up, enhancing the value proposition.

Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange and custodian founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has confidentially filed for an IPO in the U.S., according to a press release on Friday. 

The number of shares and the pricing terms have not yet been decided upon, and the company said a listing ""is expected to occur after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market and other conditions.""

By filing confidentially, Gemini can test investor appetite and prepare for a public debut without immediate scrutiny of its financials. The announcement comes after the SEC wrapped up its investigation into Gemini in February without recommending enforcement action, and follows a $5 million settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in January.

Gemini is the latest crypto firm to pursue a public listing as President Donald Trump's administration pushes more favorable regulations for the industry, which heavily funded his campaign. 

Stablecoin issuer Circle held a blockbuster debut this week, with its stock soaring in its first two days on the market. Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital moved its listing from Toronto to the Nasdaq last month. 

Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange and custodian, was founded by the Winklevoss twins in 2014. In March, the company named former Affirm executive Dan Chen as its CFO in preparation for a public offering. 

""I'm looking forward to helping Gemini scale by driving financial strategy as the company enters its next phase of growth,"" Chen wrote in a post on LinkedIn at the time.

In this article

China has granted temporary export licenses to rare-earth suppliers of the top three U.S. automakers, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, as supply chain disruptions begin to surface from Beijing's export curbs on those materials.

At least some of the licenses are valid for six months, the two sources said, declining to be named because the information is not public. It was not immediately clear what quantity or items are covered by the approval or whether the move signals China is preparing to ease the rare-earths licensing process, which industry groups say is cumbersome and has created a supply bottleneck.

China's decision in April to restrict exports of a wide range of rare earths and related magnets has tripped up the supply chains central to automakers, aerospace manufacturers, semiconductor companies and military contractors around the world.

China's dominance of the critical mineral industry, key to the green energy transition, is increasingly viewed as a key point of leverage for Beijing in its trade war with U.S. President Donald Trump. China produces around 90% of the world's rare earths, and auto industry representatives have warned of increasing threats to production due to their dependency on it for those parts.

Suppliers of three big U.S. automakers, General Motors, Ford and Jeep-maker Stellantis got clearance for some rare earth export licenses on Monday, one of the two sources said.

GM and Ford each declined to comment. Stellantis said it is working with suppliers ""to ensure an efficient licensing process"" and that so far the company has been able to ""address immediate production concerns without major disruptions.""

China's Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.

China's critical-mineral export controls have become a focus on Trump's criticism of Beijing, which he says has violated the truce reached last month to roll back tariffs and trade restrictions.

On Thursday, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping had a lengthy phone call to iron out trade differences. Trump said in social-media post that ""there should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products."" Both sides said teams will meet again soon.

U.S. auto companies are already feeling the impact of the restrictions. Ford shut down production of its Explorer SUV at its Chicago plant for a week in May because of a rare-earth shortage, the company said.

The approval for the auto suppliers follows a green light granted to a U.S. electronics firm's suppliers last week and another one issued earlier this week to suppliers of a U.S. non-auto company, the first person said, declining to name the companies.

""We have to give the Chinese the benefit of the doubt that they're working through this. It's up to them to show that they are not weaponizing it,"" said the person.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that China has introduced a tracking system for its rare earth magnet sector in a move to improve its control over the sector and crackdown on smuggling.

Greg Kidd to Acquire Controlling Interest in Know Labs and Introduce Bitcoin Treasury Strategy

SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Know Labs, Inc. (NYSE American: KNW (“Know Labs” or the “Company”), a technology innovator specializing in non-invasive health monitoring solutions, today announced that it has entered into an agreement with Goldeneye 1995 LLC (“Buyer”), an affiliate of fintech investor, entrepreneur, and former Ripple Chief Risk Officer, Greg Kidd, to acquire a controlling interest in the Company. Upon the closing of the transaction, Mr. Kidd will become Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company.


Under the terms of the agreement, the Buyer will acquire that number of shares of the Company's common stock obtained by dividing (i) the sum of 1,000 Bitcoin and a cash sum to retire existing debt, redeem outstanding preferred equity and provide additional working capital, by (ii) the per share purchase price of $0.335. The Bitcoin will be employed by the Company's treasury strategy, providing investors with significant economic exposure to this highly attractive digital asset.




“I'm thrilled to deploy a Bitcoin treasury strategy with the support of a forward-looking organization like Know Labs at a time when market and regulatory conditions are particularly favorable,” said Mr. Kidd. “We believe this approach will generate sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value.” Mr. Kidd and his team bring deep expertise in digital assets and, with this deal, will transition their existing Bitcoin yield generation strategy to the public markets.




When the Bitcoin holdings become the principal component of the Company's balance sheet, management will use the multiple of net asset value (“mNAV”) metric to measure the premium (or discount) investors ascribe to the Company's market valuation relative to its Bitcoin holdings. Given a market capitalization of $128 million, the implied entry mNAV multiple is equivalent to 1.22x and the Bitcoin holdings represent 82% of the market capitalization (assuming a price of $105,000 per Bitcoin) at closing.




Founder Ron Erickson will serve as President of a new division that will retain a team of scientists to continue the Company's proprietary diagnostic research. Upon the closing of the transaction, Mr. Erickson will become Vice Chairman of the Board. “Partnering with Greg Kidd marks a pivotal next chapter for Know Labs,” said Mr. Erickson. “We look forward to continuing our research in non-invasive medical technology. Greg's visionary leadership positions Know Labs for a bold future.”




The transaction, which was unanimously approved by the Know Labs Board of Directors, is expected to close in the third quarter of 2025, following the receipt of shareholder approval and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Why more and more companies are buying bitcoin","https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-strategy-mstr-btc-price-metaplanet-demand-treasuries-2025-6","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 09:30:00 GMT","

The bitcoin boom is drawing the attention of more companies, who are following Strategy's lead and piling up the token in their corporate treasuries.

A growing list of firms have turned themselves into bitcoin holding companies recently, incorporating the top crypto in their balance sheets along with more traditional assets like cash and bonds.

To date, 80 companies have embraced the ""bitcoin standard,"" and they own about 3.4% of the total bitcoin supply, according to a report from Bernstein Research.

Many are trying to replicate the success of Strategy, which pioneered the bitcoin treasury strategy and has amassed a trove of around 554,000 bitcoins. The company's stock has outperformed the Magnificent Seven, S&P 500, and its underlying bitcoin holdings in the last 12 months.

Following suit, last month, GameStop added $500 million of bitcoin to its balance sheet in its first-ever crypto purchase, and Trump Media & Technology Group announced plans to raise $2.5 billion for a bitcoin treasury.

In April, the SPAC Cantor Equity Partners merged crypto firm Twenty One Capital with the goal of becoming a pure-play bitcoin holding company and saw its shares spike nearly 500% in the first week of trading.

Bernstein predicts that company demand could drive $330 billion of inflows into bitcoin by 2029, with up to $124 billion of that from Strategy alone. That influx of corporate money would be bullish for bitcoin's price.

However, buying bitcoin isn't a one-size-fits-all maneuver, and Strategy's success may be hard to replicate, Bernstein said.

Bernstein estimates that around 2,000 global companies with market caps under $100 billion could be prime candidates for bitcoin adoption. These firms share characteristics like low growth (defined as sub-5% yearly revenue growth rate), low leverage, and high cash piles of $100 million or more.

Bitcoin could be a lifeline for these types of companies. Firms with poor growth prospects might decide that their cash is better spent on investing in bitcoin than letting it sit on their balance sheet earning minimal returns.

A prime example is Japanese hotel-management company turned bitcoin treasury, MetaPlanet. After years of weak profitability and stock-price stagnation, MetaPlanet began purchasing bitcoin in 2024 via cash raised from bond and equity sales. The move paid off, and the stock is up over 500% in the last year.

Some larger companies, such as Tesla, have also purchased bitcoin in the past. However, other mega-cap companies have rejected proposals to buy bitcoin. Meta is the latest example, with over 99% of shareholders voting against a bitcoin treasury plan earlier this week. Proposals have also failed at Amazon and Microsoft.

Not all businesses will find the same success as Strategy. The business software company has been piling up bitcoin for five years, enticing investors with equity, convertible debt, and preferred stock offerings to fund even more purchases.

The stock provides investors with price appreciation, convertible debt offers more capped upside, and preferred stock provides dividend payouts. The company also has the benefit of experience after weathering multiple bitcoin price crashes.

MetaPlanet and other treasury companies have issued convertible debt and equity, but Bernstein points out these companies don't have the same scale and ability to raise funds as Strategy.

However, as bitcoin popularity skyrockets, it's clear that lack of experience won't stop these companies from taking a page from the Strategy playbook.

Why Circle's ‘Super Positive' IPO Could be Bullish for Ethereum: Analysts

Circle's $1.1 billion IPO on Thursday reflected Wall Street's growing interest in stablecoins, but it may also strengthen institutions' conviction toward Ethereum, analysts told Decrypt.

Although Circle issues its USDC stablecoin across more than 40 different networks, more than half of the stablecoin's circulating supply exists on Ethereum, totaling $36.7 billion, according to crypto data provider DefiLlama.

According to Bitwise Senior Investment Strategist Juan Leon, USDC's concentration on Ethereum is primarily based around the network's prominence in decentralized finance, or DeFi. As a result, he told Decrypt that Ethereum should benefit more than other networks if USDC's footprint grows, as Circle rides a new wave of momentum.

“Overall, it's a super positive development for Ethereum and Coinbase,” he said, referring to the San Francisco-based exchange that has a revenue-sharing agreement for USDC with Circle.

“As USDC usage proliferates, that will continue to translate into more liquidity for DeFi and excitement for developers to build on Ethereum,” he added.

On Thursday, Circle shares soared 165% to $83.22 from an IPO price of $31, according to Yahoo Finance. On Friday, the company's stock price continued climbing, hitting $114.50, as of noon Eastern Time, a 38% jump from Friday's closing price. 

Circle derives income from assets backing USDC like U.S. Treasuries. Ethereum was recently trading hands around $2,500, a 3% dip over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

When it comes to Ethereum's competitors, $8 billion worth of USDC has been issued on Solana, representing around 13% of stablecoin's circulating supply. Other Layer-1 networks, including Avalanche, Sui, and Aptos, each hold less than 2% of USDC's circulating supply.

In addition to Ethereum's mainnet, Circle has issued around $10 billion worth of USDC across Ethereum scaling solutions like Polygon and layer-2 networks like Arbitrum and Base, as well as Hyperliquid, the Arbitrum-based network underpinning the decentralized exchange.

Circle's IPO is likely to generate interest in the company's business model, and as investors start evaluating how stablecoins work, Ethereum name is likely to come up as technology powering emergent tech, Gerry O'Shea, head of global market insights at asset manager Hashdex told Decrypt.

“I think this could potentially help generate more attention around Ethereum and other smart contract platforms as investors look to understand the infrastructure that powers stablecoins,” he said. “IPOs bring a lot of attention.”

Spot Ethereum ETFs, which debuted in the U.S. last year, have emerged as a gauge for institutional interest in the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. 

Although the products have generated net inflows over the past eight trading days, Thursday's inflows were relatively subdued at $11 million, compared to a recent peak of $110 million on Tuesday, according to crypto data provider CoinGlass.

Ethereum has officially broken below its 200 EMA on the daily chart, a level it has defended since February 2025. This technical breach is a notable shift in ETH's market structure and could be the start of a deeper correction many investors are not prepared for.

After weeks of consolidating within a narrow ascending channel, ETH has finally slipped out, falling sharply below the key 200 EMA (black line). This line often acts as a long-term trend indicator, and breaking beneath it signals that Ethereum may be entering a more prolonged corrective phase.

Adding to the pressure is the sharp increase in sell-side volume, which confirms the strength of the current breakdown. From a price-action standpoint, ETH's recent attempt to test the $2,800 resistance has failed, and the rejection from that level now appears to have triggered a significant wave of selling.

Cardano Founder Breaks Silence on Ethereum, Solana and Polkadot Rivalry

ByGodfrey Benjamin





Currently, Ethereum sits at around $2,473, moving between major support and looming downside risk. The next potential support lies around the 100 EMA (orange line), which has curled upward and is approaching ETH's current price. This level may offer a temporary lifeline and prevent the descent from gaining momentum, at least in the short term.

However, investors should not ignore the bearish undertone. The RSI is drifting toward 50, a neutral zone that could quickly flip into oversold territory if bearish momentum accelerates. Furthermore, Ethereum's inability to maintain the higher low pattern suggests that bulls are losing control of the trend.

Ethereum's slip below the 200 EMA is a major red flag in the current market cycle. If the 50 EMA fails to act as a bounce point, ETH may find itself revisiting the $2,300-$2,200 range in the near future. Caution is warranted, as this could be more than just a dip.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Analyst Michaël van de Poppe Says Bitcoin Is About To Go Higher, Updates Outlook on Sui and One Low-Cap Altcoin","https://dailyhodl.com/2025/06/06/analyst-michael-van-de-poppe-says-bitcoin-is-about-to-go-higher-updates-outlook-on-sui-and-one-low-cap-altcoin/","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 18:05:45 GMT","

A widely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin (BTC) is gearing up for a massive breakout after correcting to the $100,000 level.

In a new strategy session, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 790,900 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is now likely on the verge of breaking through the resistance level at $105,800.

“Bitcoin is about to break back higher, as we've taken all the liquidity and it's quickly being absorbed. These levels should usually be the end of the correction.”

He also says that Bitcoin is exhibiting market strength after retesting the $100,739 level.

“To be honest, after the recent correction on Bitcoin, this is what you'd want to see. A strong bounce back upwards, ETH also climbing back. Good times are ahead.”

Bitcoin is trading for $105,023 at time of writing.

Next up, the analyst says he remains bullish on layer-1 blockchain Sui (SUI), despite the recent major security breach of the Cetus Protocol, a decentralized exchange (DEX) operating on the Sui network.

The analyst says one reason to be bullish on SUI is that the network's total value locked (TVL) is recovering after its decline triggered by the Cetus hack. The TVL is the amount of capital deposited within a protocol's smart contracts and is often used to gauge the health of a crypto ecosystem.

“SUI has continued to show strength. Despite the recent exploit on Cetus, the TVL on SUI is still $1.8 billion and constantly growing. It has run back with 20% since the recent drop. Such a strong signal and such a strong ecosystem.”

SUI is trading for $3.18 at time of writing, up 1.4% in the last 24 hours.

Lastly, the analyst says that the cross-chain messaging protocol Wormhole (W) is showing bullish divergence on the weekly chart.

A bullish divergence, which suggests price will start to increase, occurs when the price of assets records lower lows while indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator indicator, are witnessing higher lows.

“W remains to be one of my portfolio altcoins. They are bringing Dogecoin to Solana as well, as they bridge the memecoin towards the other chain. Secondly, they are the exclusive partner of BlackRock's BUIDL and more partners. Massive bullish divergence.”

Wormhole is trading for $0.07355 at time of writing, down 2.8% in the last 24 hours.

 In May 2025, FIFA announced the launch of a dedicated layer-1 blockchain utilizing Avalanche's Subnet technology. This transition marks a departure from its previous use of the Algorand blockchain, which had powered FIFA's initial ventures into Web3, including the FIFA  Collect NFT marketplace launched ahead of the 2023 Club World Cup in Saudi Arabia. The new blockchain is designed to serve as the new infrastructure for FIFA's blockchain-based products, such as digital collectibles and games, offering enhanced performance, scalability and user experience.Did you know? FIFA, the global governing body of football, was founded on May 21, 1904, in Paris by seven European nations. Today, it boasts 211 member associations — more than the United Nations — and is headquartered in Zürich, Switzerland.

Apple, Airbnb, Google and Elon Musk's X are holding early discussions with crypto companies about integrating stablecoins into their payment systems, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke with Fortune.



The tech giants see stablecoins as a way to cut transaction costs and streamline international payments. Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, offering a bridge between crypto infrastructure and traditional finance. In 2024, they facilitated more than $27.6 trillion in transactions — more than Visa and Mastercard combined — according to a report from the World Economic Forum.



Stablecoins have been a fast-growing area of interest for traditional finance and that appears to be exploding even further following stablecoin issuer Circle's (CRCL) gangbuster IPO on Thursday, Shares more than doubled from an already-raised offering price and they're higher by another 40% today.



According to Fortune, Apple has reportedly been in talks with crypto companies since January to explore incorporating stablecoins into Apple Pay and its wider payments infrastructure. Meanwhile, X is in discussions with Stripe to potentially enable stablecoin-based transactions.



Airbnb is exploring stablecoins as a way to reduce the cut it pays to card networks like Visa and Mastercard. One crypto executive told Fortune the home-rental giant has been in talks with Worldpay since the beginning of 2025.



Political shifts, primarily U.S. President Donald Trump's return to office — has made adopting crypto less risky in the U.S. corporate landscape.



Some analysts predict the stablecoin market could hit $2 trillion by 2028. One key tailwind: the expected passage of the GENIUS Act, a bill that would establish regulatory clarity for stablecoin issuers and potentially encourage more mainstream adoption in the United States.

 Bitcoin is now front and center at political conferences and corporate boardrooms. In this episode of Byte-Sized Insight, we're at Bitcoin 2025 exploring whether it has been captured, or simply arrived. 

Sixteen years after its launch, Bitcoin is no longer just a cypherpunk experiment or an anti-establishment asset. In 2025, it's increasingly rubbing shoulders with politicians, institutions, and Wall Street titans. 

That shift was on full display at the recent Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, where Cointelegraph was on the ground to capture the mood.

In this week's episode of Byte-Sized Insight, Cointelegraph's Gareth Jenkinson explores whether politics and institutions have captured Bitcoin (BTC) or whether it has simply become too important to ignore.

Once a Bitcoin-only gathering for hardcore believers, the conference now features prominent political figures such as US Vice President JD Vance, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., and a host of institutional investors. Their presence signals a seismic shift: Bitcoin is now firmly in the sights of the political and financial elite.

One of the most striking trends to emerge is the rise of Bitcoin treasury companies. Inspired by MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor, firms like Metaplanet, Twenty One and Nakamoto are now putting Bitcoin on their balance sheets and offering public investors a proxy to BTC exposure through equity markets.

Gareth sat down with Dylan LeClair, director of Bitcoin strategy at Metaplanet, which recently became Japan's most-traded stock by volume and value. Said LeClair:

Also featured in the episode is Jack Mallers, the outspoken CEO of Strike and founder of Twenty One, a new Bitcoin treasury company backed by Tether, Softbank, and Cantor Fitzgerald. 

Mallers welcomed the growing political and institutional attention but emphasized that Bitcoin's use cases are evolving naturally, from payments to long-term value storage.

To gain historical perspective, Gareth also spoke with Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream and creator of Hashcash, the proof-of-work system referenced in the Bitcoin white paper. 

Back offered a long view on how Bitcoin's technical and social evolution reflects its increasing global relevance. He offered the idea that institutional adoption is just another use case.

Tree Planting Efforts Could Actually Worsen Climate Change

With wildfires turning forests into “massive carbon emitters,” planting trees in some places could inadvertently increase carbon emissions, a new report says

CLIMATEWIRE | Carbon markets that fund forest preservation and tree-planting might actually be worsening climate change by increasing risks for wildfires that emit massive levels of greenhouse gases, a new United Nations-affiliated report says.

Forests have been seen as one of the most effective places to counter climate change by absorbing carbon emissions. But that's changed, says a May paper from the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health (UNU-INWEH), an academic arm of the international U.N.

In the past decade, wildfires of record-breaking size have erupted in places such as Canada, Australia, Siberia and the Amazon rainforest. This week, forest wildfires forced evacuations of thousands of Canadians in Manitoba and Alberta provinces.

“Forests and peatlands have increasingly transitioned into massive carbon emitters in many parts of the world due to increasing wildfires,” the report says. Climate policies and carbon-mitigation activities ”fail to account for these substantial emissions.”

The report highlights weaknesses in a central global strategy for addressing climate change — planting and protecting trees — which has attracted billions of dollars from polluters that fund the projects to offset their own carbon emissions. A large share of the money is paid through the voluntary carbon market, a largely unregulated system that has come under increasing scrutiny over its integrity.

Recent major wildfires have been particularly harmful. The 2023 forest wildfires in Canada emitted more greenhouse gases than the total industrial emissions of any country in the world except for China and India, Ju Hyoung Lee, a research fellow at UNU and lead author of the report, said in an interview from Seoul, South Korea.

In California, wildfires in 2024 destroyed parts of forests that were supposed to be storing carbon through an offset program under the state's cap-and-trade carbon market.

Without systematic monitoring of forest conditions, the paper says, the voluntary carbon market and other policies that promote forests “may unintentionally exacerbate wildfire hazards.”

Planting new trees to absorb carbon could have the opposite effect, the report says, as more heat and increased carbon dioxide emissions from climate change accelerate forest growth while also depleting soil moisture.

“Planting more and more trees in such an environment with the purpose of carbon mitigation will likely increase carbon emissions due to future fires,” the report warns.

When the businesses certifying forest projects in the voluntary carbon market consider wildfire risk, they normally look at historical incidents of fires, Lee said. But, she added, “Forests are changing, and our forests [won't] be like what it was like for the last 20 years.""

Historical data often leaves out the past five years, which includes some of the worst fires on record, Lee said.

As a result, fire risk is typically underestimated by nonprofits such as Verra, which sets standards for and certifies climate projects to be listed on the voluntary market, Lee said. Representatives for Verra did not respond to a request for comment.

Concerns about forests and their changing dynamics have existed for more than a decade, Kaveh Madani, director of the UNU-INWEH, said in an interview from Toronto.

The report hopes to get the message out, Madani said, that existing forest programs and certification standards were developed using science that's now outdated — and the projects ”can increase the risk of increased emissions, in some cases.”

Madani emphasized that not all forest programs in the voluntary carbon market and elsewhere create a wildfire threat.

The paper advocates reforming the voluntary carbon market and similar systems to better account for forest conditions and to prevent unintended consequences, including more wildfires.

Rainfall, soil health, and expected future droughts and heat waves should be considered before approving forest projects “as a carbon emissions reduction solution,” the paper says.

Satellite observations could identify areas where forests are growing and fuels are accumulating, leading them to be excluded from carbon markets “due to the potential high emissions in case of future fires,” the paper says.

The risk of wildfire and other environmental conditions that could damage forests “must be included in our planning for the future and the schemes that we have in place,” Madani said.

At Secret Math Meeting, Researchers Struggle to Outsmart AI

The world's leading mathematicians were stunned by how adept artificial intelligence is at doing their jobs

By Lyndie Chiou edited by Clara Moskowitz

On a weekend in mid-May, a clandestine mathematical conclave convened. Thirty of the world's most renowned mathematicians traveled to Berkeley, Calif., with some coming from as far away as the U.K. The group's members faced off in a showdown with a “reasoning” chatbot that was tasked with solving problems they had devised to test its mathematical mettle. After throwing professor-level questions at the bot for two days, the researchers were stunned to discover it was capable of answering some of the world's hardest solvable problems. “I have colleagues who literally said these models are approaching mathematical genius,” says Ken Ono, a mathematician at the University of Virginia and a leader and judge at the meeting.

The chatbot in question is powered by o4-mini, a so-called reasoning large language model (LLM). It was trained by OpenAI to be capable of making highly intricate deductions. Google's equivalent, Gemini 2.5 Flash, has similar abilities. Like the LLMs that powered earlier versions of ChatGPT, o4-mini learns to predict the next word in a sequence. Compared with those earlier LLMs, however, o4-mini and its equivalents are lighter-weight, more nimble models that train on specialized datasets with stronger reinforcement from humans. The approach leads to a chatbot capable of diving much deeper into complex problems in math than traditional LLMs.

To track the progress of o4-mini, OpenAI previously tasked Epoch AI, a nonprofit that benchmarks LLMs, to come up with 300 math questions whose solutions had not yet been published. Even traditional LLMs can correctly answer many complicated math questions. Yet when Epoch AI asked several such models these questions, which were dissimilar to those they had been trained on, the most successful were able to solve less than 2 percent, showing these LLMs lacked the ability to reason. But o4-mini would prove to be very different.

Epoch AI hired Elliot Glazer, who had recently finished his math Ph.D., to join the new collaboration for the benchmark, dubbed FrontierMath, in September 2024. The project collected novel questions over varying tiers of difficulty, with the first three tiers covering undergraduate-, graduate- and research-level challenges. By February 2025, Glazer found that o4-mini could solve around 20 percent of the questions. He then moved on to a fourth tier: 100 questions that would be challenging even for an academic mathematician. Only a small group of people in the world would be capable of developing such questions, let alone answering them. The mathematicians who participated had to sign a nondisclosure agreement requiring them to communicate solely via the messaging app Signal. Other forms of contact, such as traditional e-mail, could potentially be scanned by an LLM and inadvertently train it, thereby contaminating the dataset.

The group made slow, steady progress in finding questions. But Glazer wanted to speed things up, so Epoch AI hosted the in-person meeting on Saturday, May 17, and Sunday, May 18. There, the participants would finalize the final batch of challenge questions. Ono split the 30 attendees into groups of six. For two days, the academics competed against themselves to devise problems that they could solve but would trip up the AI reasoning bot. Each problem the o4-mini couldn't solve would garner the mathematician who came up with it a $7,500 reward.

By the end of that Saturday night, Ono was frustrated with the bot, whose unexpected mathematical prowess was foiling the group's progress. “I came up with a problem which experts in my field would recognize as an open question in number theory—a good Ph.D.-level problem,” he says. He asked o4-mini to solve the question. Over the next 10 minutes, Ono watched in stunned silence as the bot unfurled a solution in real time, showing its reasoning process along the way. The bot spent the first two minutes finding and mastering the related literature in the field. Then it wrote on the screen that it wanted to try solving a simpler “toy” version of the question first in order to learn. A few minutes later, it wrote that it was finally prepared to solve the more difficult problem. Five minutes after that, o4-mini presented a correct but sassy solution. “It was starting to get really cheeky,” says Ono, who is also a freelance mathematical consultant for Epoch AI. “And at the end, it says, ‘No citation necessary because the mystery number was computed by me!'”

Defeated, Ono jumped onto Signal early that Sunday morning and alerted the rest of the participants. “I was not prepared to be contending with an LLM like this,” he says, “I've never seen that kind of reasoning before in models. That's what a scientist does. That's frightening.”

Although the group did eventually succeed in finding 10 questions that stymied the bot, the researchers were astonished by how far AI had progressed in the span of one year. Ono likened it to working with a “strong collaborator.” Yang Hui He, a mathematician at the London Institute for Mathematical Sciences and an early pioneer of using AI in math, says, “This is what a very, very good graduate student would be doing—in fact, more.”

The bot was also much faster than a professional mathematician, taking mere minutes to do what it would take such a human expert weeks or months to complete.

While sparring with o4-mini was thrilling, its progress was also alarming. Ono and He express concern that the o4-mini's results might be trusted too much. “There's proof by induction, proof by contradiction, and then proof by intimidation,” He says. “If you say something with enough authority, people just get scared. I think o4-mini has mastered proof by intimidation; it says everything with so much confidence.”

By the end of the meeting, the group started to consider what the future might look like for mathematicians. Discussions turned to the inevitable “tier five”—questions that even the best mathematicians couldn't solve. If AI reaches that level, the role of mathematicians would undergo a sharp change. For instance, mathematicians may shift to simply posing questions and interacting with reasoning-bots to help them discover new mathematical truths, much the same as a professor does with graduate students. As such, Ono predicts that nurturing creativity in higher education will be a key in keeping mathematics going for future generations.

“I've been telling my colleagues that it's a grave mistake to say that generalized artificial intelligence will never come, [that] it's just a computer,” Ono says. “I don't want to add to the hysteria, but in many ways these large language models are already outperforming most of our best graduate students in the world.”

Can Trump's NASA Afford to Send Humans to Mars?

The White House's budget plan for NASA would be woefully inadequate for achieving near-term human voyages to Mars, experts say

By Alexandra Witze & Nature magazine 

If humans set foot on Mars (as shown in this artist's rendering), they will contend with a harsh environment.

JPL/NASA

US President Donald Trump last week laid out one of the biggest challenges ever for NASA — to land the first humans on Mars.

But his detailed budget request for the fiscal year 2026 also proposed cancelling dozens of the space agency's missions, including projects to study Earth, Mars and Venus. And the next day, on 31 May, Trump withdrew his nomination for NASA chief, the businessman and commercial astronaut Jared Isaacman.

All of this has left the space agency in turmoil, and the scientists who normally participate in NASA's missions split over whether they support the push for the red planet.

NASA has wanted to put people on Mars for decades, but both technological and budget limitations mean that probably will not happen until the 2040s under current plans. Trump wants to accelerate that timeline. On 30 May, the White House proposed to spend some US$1 billion in 2026 on Mars plans, including research into new spacesuits and an astronaut landing system. “These investments will provide the technologies necessary for future Mars exploration and eventual crewed missions to Mars,” the NASA budget plan said.

If the space agency really does want to focus on sending humans to Mars, space-policy specialists say, it will need to massively ramp up its spending. A human mission to Mars is likely to cost hundreds of billions of dollars spread over a number of years; the agency currently spends $25 billion a year on all of its programmes, and Trump has proposed cutting that to under $19 billion. “Right now, with the budgets that are proposed, we can't afford to send people to Mars,” says John Grunsfeld, an astrophysicist and former NASA astronaut who led the agency's science programmes from 2012 to 2016.

Trump's latest rhetoric on Mars echoes decisions he made during his first term as president, when, in 2017, he announced that NASA would send astronauts back to the Moon. In 2022, the agency tested a mega-rocket that is intended to achieve that objective, but that mission, Artemis I, was uncrewed. Many technical challenges remain before people can be put on the lunar surface — a goal currently slated for 2027.

One challenge is achieving success with the giant Starship vehicle, built by the aerospace company SpaceX in Hawthorne, California. Once NASA's mega-rocket has propelled astronauts into lunar orbit, they will rendezvous with Starship, which will fly them to the Moon's surface. But Starship has yet to orbit Earth successfully, much less demonstrate the frequent launches and in-space refuellings needed for the Moon landing; its most recent test flight ended in an explosion on 27 May.

Days after that blow-up, Elon Musk, the billionaire chief executive of SpaceX who has advised Trump, said he still hoped to launch the first Starship to Mars next year. Some scientists have been put off the idea of landing humans on Mars by Musk's involvement. The technology entrepreneur has long talked of colonizing the red planet, but with little consideration of societal ethics or international norms. In recent months, he led the Trump administration's efforts to downsize the US government and slash its science funding, even as SpaceX is likely to compete for billions of dollars' worth of government contracts on the quest for Mars.

Others are more excited about the prospect of landing people on the red planet. NASA has overseen missions to Mars many times, sending a series of robotic spacecraft, including the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers. Some researchers say that astronauts could explore more quickly and gain better insight into whether Mars has ever hosted extraterrestrial life. “If we definitively want to answer the question of whether Mars had life or has life today, I think we have to send humans,” says Tanya Harrison, a planetary scientist with the Outer Space Institute who is based in Ottawa, Canada.

But even those in favour caution that a journey to Mars would not only be costly — taking funding away from numerous other research programmes — but would also pose many physical risks. On the way to Mars, astronauts would face extreme isolation and higher doses of deadly space radiation over longer periods than they have ever been exposed to on the Moon or on space stations. If they were to land successfully on Mars, they would have to get out of their capsule without collapsing after the zero-gravity voyage; begin working in a frigid environment where the soil is full of toxic chemicals and there is almost no air to breathe; and deal with abrasive dust storms.

There are solutions, such as living inside an underground lava tube that was created by volcanic activity, which could offer protection against radiation and dust storms. But visiting Mars will be like visiting Antarctica — another hostile, perilous environment — with vastly greater risks, scientists say. “I want to disabuse people of the assumptions that they have that humans are going to be fine,” Erik Antonsen, a researcher in space physiology at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said at conference on human space exploration on 28 May.

Trump's proposal is likely to have support from some politicians in the US Congress. They might vote to appropriate at least a proportion of the vast sums required to go to Mars because they are keen to achieve exploration milestones before China's burgeoning space agency does. China has announced plans to put astronauts on the Moon by 2030, and on Mars after that.

So some scientists are determined to make the best of it. “Given that there is active planning going on for developing the architecture for human missions through NASA, we feel it's important that science has a seat at the table,” says Bruce Jakosky, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder. He and others led a study in 2023 that identified key scientific goals, including studying astrobiology, that astronauts might accomplish on the red planet.

In the near term, Jakosky says, NASA should prioritize a robotic mission to bring back dozens of rock, dirt and air samples gathered on Mars by the $2.7-billion Perseverance rover. Doing so would demonstrate that the agency is capable of sending spacecraft to and from Mars, he says, and would allow scientists to analyse the rocks for signs of life and for clues to how toxic the Martian surface could be. However, the agency has struggled with how to pay for such a mission, and Trump has proposed cancelling it.

In Grunsfeld's view, NASA should focus on building a streamlined architecture to get humans to Mars as simply as possible. That could mean, for example, testing new spacesuit designs at the International Space Station and dropping plans for astronauts to build extensive Moon bases. “We need to use the technology we have to the maximum extent,” he says.

Whatever NASA, Congress and Trump decide, the current political uncertainty is a huge challenge, Harrison says. She worries that last week's proposals might not lead to sustained momentum: “Is this blustering for right now, and will Mars be forgotten a year from now?”

Nuclear engines are the future of spaceflight, but exactly which kind is still up for debate.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Humanity owes a debt of gratitude to the chemical rockets that have launched satellites, astronauts, and entire space stations into space. But if we have any hope of reliably settling on other planets, those engines will likely need to be swapped out with nuclear ones. 

The U.S. is very aware of the nuclear future of spaceflight—or at least it used to be. NASA and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) were launching a nuclear thermal rocket (NTR) powered by solid uranium by 2027 called the Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations, or DRACO, but that program has now been canceled under the Trump Administration. 

While NTR's future is uncertain, that spacecraft's design isn't the only horse in the spaceflight race. For one, there's an entire other category of nuclear propulsion known as NEP, which converts nuclear heat into electricity to power ion thrusters. But even within the NTR family, there isn't absolute certainty about what these rockets might look like in the near future. 

While DRACO was the standard-bearer for this technology, a new paper published in the journal Acta Astronautica details the potential engineering challenges facing a rival NTR concept known as a centrifugal nuclear thermal rocket, or CNTR. True to its name, this engine uses a centrifuge to keep uranium molten (i.e. liquid), and then bubbles through hydrogen to eventually produce thrust. 

One of its key advantages over other NTR designs is its efficiency. According to Universe Today, DRACO's design used a solid high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) to generate lots of heat that turns hydrogen from a liquid to gas (and thus propulsion), providing a specific impulse of roughly 900 seconds. Without getting too much into it (after all, it is rocket science), specific impulse describes how efficiently an engine converts fuel to thrust. 

CNTR, on the other hand, can pull off a specific impulse of 1,500 seconds—a dramatic improvement. 

“The bubble-through reactor design features a reactor fuel which is rotated at high speed so as to maintain a layer of liquid fuel around the hydrogen-permeable inner cylindrical surface,” the authors wrote. “As the hydrogen propellant is bubbled through this liquid fuel, it is heated to the temperature of the liquid fuel, exiting the engine through the nozzle to produce a thrust.”

Of course, there's a reason that the DRACO program didn't originally adopt this carnival ride approach to its own nuclear propulsion engine—it's easier said than done. In the paper, scientists from the University of Alabama in Huntsville and Ohio State University talk through just a few of the engineering challenges that lie ahead. One problem is that certain unwanted elements (like xenon and samarium) would need to be continuously removed from the system, and the researchers note that modeling the interaction of the bubbled hydrogen is immensely difficult. 

But as Universe Today also notes, the big problem is guaranteeing that only hydrogen escapes the propulsion nozzle, and not uranium fuel. If uranium does escape, the nuclear reaction slows down, and so does the engine's efficiency. 

Although scientists have worked on designs for CNTR engines for years, these centrifugal machines still remain in the modeling phase, and are likely years away from prototyping. By then, nuclear propulsion engines will likely be whizzing around the Solar System. But just as the V-2 rocket was far from the apex of chemical propulsion, the first NTR-enabled spacecraft will be far from the last word in the next chapter of human spaceflight.

A wave of mpox cases in West Africa has been concentrated in densely populated Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital city. Credit: Patrick Meinhardt/AFP via Getty

A surge of mpox infections in the small African nation of Sierra Leone has pummelled the country's health-care system, raising the possibility that the virus will spread to neighbouring countries and spark a larger outbreak throughout the densely populated region of West Africa.

Sierra Leone has confirmed 15 deaths and more than 3,000 mpox infections — more than half of all new infections for Africa — over the past month. According to an analysis of 76 viral genomes posted on the discussion forum Virological.org on 28 May, the outbreak began in November. The work also suggests that there have been at least four times more infections than officials have reported, says Edyth Parker, a genomic epidemiologist at the Institute of Genomics and Global Health in Ede, Nigeria, who is a co-author.

“The situation is so dire — the number of cases keeps increasing rapidly,” says Jia Kangbai, an infectious-diseases epidemiologist at Njala University in Freetown, Sierra Leone. “Things are getting very challenging now.”

The virus that causes mpox can lead to painful, fluid-filled lesions on the skin, and produce fever and, in severe cases, death. The virus, which is thought to persist in some wild rodent species, is endemic in several African countries, including Sierra Leone, and occasionally spills into people.

Health officials have been on high alert for surges of the virus that causes mpox ever since it spread to regions that it had never reached before, causing a global outbreak of the disease in 2022. That outbreak, which continues today at a slower pace, has infected more than 100,000 people, mainly men who have sex with men.

The virus that causes mpox (pink) is shown infecting a cell (green) in this colourized electron microscope image.

But the boom in infections in Sierra Leone has virologists worried once again: the country has reported a near-exponential growth in mpox cases that seem to be spreading from person to person, mainly among young people, both men and women. Epidemiological data suggest that sexual contact is a driver of the outbreak, because several sex workers have been infected and many people have reported genital lesions, according to a 27 May study posted on the preprint server medRxiv ahead of peer review1.

The surge in cases, which has been concentrated in Sierra Leone's capital city of Freetown, is fuelled by the same strain, clade IIb, that caused the global outbreak, according to the Virological.org analysis. This shows that when mpox is “put into a densely populated area where you have these dense sexual networks, it can take off very easily”, says Jason Kindrachuk, a virologist at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, who co-authored the medRxiv preprint.

The number of reported infections is likely to continue increasing sharply, because Sierra Leone's health-care system lacks the capacity to curb the outbreak, Kangbai says. He adds that the country is entering its rainy season, meaning that more people will congregate indoors, creating more opportunities for the virus to spread.

This outbreak comes as several African countries continue to battle their own mpox outbreaks, putting pressure on resources across the continent. A concerning strain of the virus, called clade Ib, has gained the ability to spread through sexual contact, causing a boom in infections across Central Africa, especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), since 2024.

Metrics details

Quality control (QC) is a crucial step to ensure the reliability of data obtained from RNA sequencing experiments, including spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT). Existing QC approaches for SRT that have been adopted from single-cell or single-nucleus RNA sequencing methods are confounded by spatial biology and are inappropriate for SRT data. In addition, no methods currently exist for identifying histological tissue artifacts that are unique to SRT. Here, we introduce SpotSweeper, a spatially aware QC method that leverages local neighborhoods to correct for spatial confounding in order to identify both local outliers and regional artifacts in SRT. Using SpotSweeper on publicly available data, we identify a consistent set of Visium barcoded spots as systematically low quality and demonstrate that SpotSweeper accurately identifies two distinct types of regional artifacts. SpotSweeper represents a substantial advancement in spatially resolved transcriptomics QC for SRT, providing a robust, generalizable framework to ensure data reliability across diverse experimental conditions and technologies.

Elon Musk's business empire, including SpaceX, Starlink, and Tesla collectively stands to lose at least $48 billion in sales over roughly the next decade if President Donald Trump acts on his veiled threat to cancel the companies' contracts with the US government, according to a WIRED review of publicly available data. Amid growing criticism from Musk on Thursday about the federal budget, Trump said that “the easiest way to save money” would be “to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.”

The federal government typically retains sweeping authority to terminate contracts “for convenience,” a catchall term that can include budget constraints or shifting priorities. But in practice, severing ties with Musk's companies would be far from simple, carrying serious consequences for the US across areas like defense, space, and transportation.

Musk and Trump have been publicly sparring over a spending bill moving through Congress and supported by the president. The legislation, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, advances Trump priorities such as cutting taxes and bolstering funding for border security, but it would also add $3 trillion to the national debt, according to an official estimate.

Musk has warned that the government's ballooning debt will push the country into “de facto bankruptcy.” In total, the government's outstanding contracts with SpaceX and Tesla amount to about 2 percent of the projected deficit from the new spending bill.

Many observers predicted that Musk's financial support for Trump's reelection campaign and his role as an advisor to the White House would be a boon for ventures such as SpaceX, which has long done work for the US government. But now, the deteriorating relationship has become a significant business liability.

Opportunities may disappear for Space's Starlink internet service to do work overseas, Tesla to provide armored vehicles to the State Department, and Musk-founded Boring Company to potentially help drill an Amtrak train tunnel. Tesla shares fell over 14 percent on Thursday, wiping out $152 billion from the company's market cap, though the stock has since partially recovered.

If Trump seeks further retribution for Musk's attacks, federal government investigations and potential litigation into his companies could cost the billionaire at least $2.37 billion in purported penalties, congressional estimates from January show.

Musk and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.

Most of Musk's work for the government is through his private space technology company SpaceX, which launches rockets and also sells satellite-based internet. Beside NASA, the US military heavily depends on SpaceX to help launch satellites into orbit for secure communications, spying on enemies, and GPS functioning.

In the coming years, SpaceX is slated to directly collect about $34 billion from NASA and the US military for rocket-related projects. The estimate includes the maximum amount of unpaid but contracted funds, according to summaries the US government posts online.

The data show the US is also on the hook for about $14 billion for SpaceX's Starlink internet service at numerous offices, such as a Department of Interior facility in Nevada.

The data could be outdated or include errors, but many of the listed figures line up with press releases from agencies such as the US Space Force. Some of the funding is subject to Congressional approval, and a portion could end up going to SpaceX's rivals.

But SpaceX's competitors have faced numerous technical setbacks, and Musk's company remains the dominant market leader. The billionaire said this week that SpaceX would earn about $15.5 billion in revenue this year, nearly double estimates from two years ago. SpaceX has accounted for 134 of the 166 orbital launches in the US so far this year, according to tracking by Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian.

WIRED didn't review detailed contracts or search for deals the government may have struck with Musk's companies through intermediaries. For instance, some government agencies may be buying ads on Musk's X social media platform through advertising agencies.

The government's vehicle fleet includes Tesla electric vehicles, according to documents online, and the General Services Administration recently paid the company for maintenance.

But the GSA's annual Federal Fleet Report doesn't break down the number of vehicles by manufacturer or offer details on future spending. The report lists 7,706 battery electric vehicles in the government fleet. Earlier this year, the Trump administration paused orders of new zero-emissions vehicles, dealing a blow to companies such as Tesla.

Musk's companies have benefitted from government support for years. In February, an analysis by the Washington Post found Musk businesses had received at least $38 billion since 2003 in government contracts, loans, subsidies and tax credits across the US, including at the state and local levels. A New York Times analysis from October identified at least $15.4 billion in federal government contracts over the past decade for Tesla and SpaceX.

But Musk himself has tried to take a chainsaw to federal spending through his work leading the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency which claims to have saved $180 billion since January, including by canceling contracts, though that figure remains highly disputed.

Some of DOGE's efforts were temporarily blocked by the federal courts and also drew protests from federal labor unions, public activists, Congress, states, and even Trump's own aides and cabinet secretaries. Last month, Musk said he was stepping away from DOGE work to focus on his companies.

Trump's cost-cutting initiatives haven't stopped, though. Hiring freezes remain in effect, and the importance of stretching each dollar further is being emphasized more than ever at many federal agencies, according to representatives at two companies with major government contracts. They declined to be named out of fear of retribution from Trump.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Barry Diller Invented Prestige TV. Then He Conquered the Internet","https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-barry-diller-interview-fox/","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

Of all the egomaniacal lions who ruled Hollywood during the 20th century gatekeeper era, very few made a brilliant pivot to the internet. The exception is Barry Diller. After leading programming at ABC, running Paramount, and supercharging Fox by launching its broadcast network in the late 1980s, Diller no longer wanted to work for anyone else. Either you are or you aren't, he said of independence. As a free agent he quickly grasped the power of interactivity and built an empire that includes Expedia Group, almost the entire online dating sector (Tinder, Match, OkCupid), and an online media lineup that includes People, which wrote a hit piece on him early in his career titled “Failing Upwards.”

In his absorbing memoir, Who Knew, the third act of Diller's career gets short shrift, as the road to becoming an internet billionaire is dispatched in a few dozen pages. The bulk of the book weaves his life as a not-quite-out gay man (who nonetheless passionately loves his iconic wife Diane von Furstenberg) with a deliciously dishy account of his Hollywood days. So as a WIRED kind of reader, I start our interview by calling him out on the tea shortage regarding his life in tech.

“What do you mean?” growls Diller, a notorious suffer-no-fools guy, who two weeks after publication is undoubtedly getting tired of book promotion. When I tell him I just wanted to hear wonderful details from his tech days, like the ones he shared about his earlier acts, his demeanor changes, and he cheerfully agrees with me. “I did whiz by it,” he says of his internet triumphs, citing time constraints. (Note: the book was 15 years in the making.) “It is something I should have done and I didn't do.”

This is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter.

SIGN UP for Plaintext to read the whole thing, and tap Steven's unique insights and unmatched contacts for the long view on tech.

I try to make up for the omission in our conversation. To get things started, I remind him of a 1993 Ken Auletta New Yorker profile titled, “Barry Diller's Search for the Future.” It describes Diller's quest for a post-Hollywood third act using the metaphor of his newly found obsession with an Apple PowerBook. A decade into the PC revolution, the idea of a media mogul actually using a computer was a novelty, and Auletta acted as if Diller had invented public key cryptography.

But the PowerBook was critical, says Diller. During his first job, as a 20-year-old working the mail room at William Morris, he buried himself in the archives and tried to read every single file and contract to understand the nuances of the business. In every subsequent job, he set out to absorb voluminous information before making critical decisions. It was his superpower. With the Apple laptop now he could have all this data at his fingertips. “I could do everything myself,” he says. “Tech has basically rescued me from my own obsolescence.” In the early '90s—the perfect time to learn about the digital world, just before the boom—he went on a high-tech listening tour that included visits to Microsoft and the MIT Media Lab. “My eyes were saucers,” he says. “I ate every inch up.”

He also met Steve Jobs on his tour, who showed him the first few reels of a movie he was working on called Toy Story. “I've never had an aptitude for animation—I don't like it,” Diller says. “Of course he was right and I was wrong. He pounded me to join the Pixar board, and I just didn't want to do it. Steve doesn't like to be turned down.” Diller describes his relationship with Jobs thereafter as tension-packed. He marveled at Jobs' business savvy but despised his scorched-earth tactics. “The idea of having a 30 percent tax on going through the Apple store was, and is, an absolute outrage. It was pure Steve. But it's breaking apart now,” he adds, referring to recent antitrust litigation that he's clearly following.

When the internet took off, Diller went on a buying binge. Some prizes are mostly forgotten—CitySearch?—but others were inspired. He convinced Microsoft's Steve Ballmer to sell him Expedia, and it became the centerpiece of a travel group that now includes Hotels.com, Orbitz, and Vrbo. The total valuation of his companies is now over $100 billion. He credits most of it to “luck, circumstance, and timing.”

The book provides evidence that there's more to Diller's success than happenstance. Even before becoming his own boss, Diller operated like a founder. He joined ABC in his mid-twenties as a woefully inexperienced nobody, and bucked decades of tradition by arguing that the network should show films in prime time—and the ratings blockbuster Movie of the Week was born. Then he pushed ABC to make its own movies, and even created the mini-series, notably Roots. He invented prestige TV! When I tell Diller that this feat seemed to presage Netflix's entry into original content, he agrees, and adds a bit of commentary to Hollywood's current struggle with tech giants. “The incumbents stood by while Netflix took their business away from them,” he says. Meanwhile, he says, Apple and Amazon started their streaming services with different business incentives—the former to keep people in its ecosystem, the latter to keep customers signed up to Prime. “It's hard to compete against that,” he says “It's not that these old media companies aren't going to survive. It's just they're never going to be the dominant player anymore. That's just gone.”

He writes that while the people he knows in the “algorithmic” movie business are even richer than the ones he hung out with earlier in his career, “I don't know anyone who is having any fun.” In our conversation, he extols the satisfying process of creating a narrative film and bringing it to market. In comparison, the best tech has to offer is something like Tinder. When he first saw its nascent form—it basically adopted the “hot or not” format to a dating app—he saw great possibilities, and snapped up the team. Then came months of technical development. “The result was something thrilling, but it pales in comparison to the creation of content,” he says.

Diller, of course, is on top of the AI revolution. “It's going to change so many things,” he says, comparing it to the shift from analog to digital. “Do you know Sam Altman?” I ask. I should have known better. The man who just wrote a book dropping the name of every Hollywood royal of the past 40 years says, “Sam is one of my closest friends, and has been since before he became Sam Altman.” Until recently, Altman sat on the Expedia board and helped the company integrate AI into the app.

I mention that if ChatGPT had existed when Diller first worked in the William Morris mailroom, he wouldn't have had to painstakingly read every file. He could have simply uploaded the trove into a large language model and asked it questions. Anyone who did that would have Diller's superpower! “I think you're right,” he says. “That's why I think the future is unpredictable.” Unless, as Alan Kay once said, you invent it.

X, formerly Twitter, announced on Friday that it has partnered with Polymarket, naming it the platform's official prediction market partner. Launched in 2020, Polymarket allows users to bet on the outcomes of real-world events using cryptocurrency.

Although the companies didn't announce specifics about the partnership, they shared that they will be launching “an integrated product to deliver data-driven insights and recommendations.” Polymarket predictions will be combined with X data to deliver live insights, with real-time annotations of market moves from Grok and relevant X posts, Polymarket explained in a press release.

The product will be the first in “a suite of integrations and unique experiences” that will emerge from the partnership, the company said. 

“Combining Polymarket's accurate, unbiased, and real-time prediction market probabilities with Grok's analysis and X's real time insights will enable us to provide contextualized, data-driven insights to millions of Polymarket users around the world instantaneously,” said Shayne Coplan, founder and CEO of Polymarket, in the press release. “We look forward to enhancing X and Polymarket users' ability to make instant sense of breaking news and make informed decisions about the future as we continue to scale our platform.”

In 2024, over $8 billion in predictions were made on Polymarket across politics, current events, pop culture, and more. 

The news comes nearly a year after Polymarket partnered with AI-powered search engine Perplexity to display news summaries of events. This happened around the same time that Polymarket partnered with Substack to allow writers to embed prediction data from its platform into their posts.

As Apple prepares to unveil iOS 19 at WWDC 2025 on Monday, several rumors have surfaced, including a potential new name for the operating system, an entirely new design inspired by the Vision Pro, and more.  

Here's a roundup of the most notable features rumored to be coming to iOS 19. 

Sources told Bloomberg that Apple plans to rename its operating systems to reflect the release year rather than using version numbers. This means that iOS 19 will be renamed iOS 26, similar to how car model years are designated. This name change will also apply to other software updates, such as iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26.

Anticipated to be the most significant design change since iOS 7, the operating system may feature a complete visual overhaul, one that's reportedly inspired by Apple's Vision Pro headset, according to Bloomberg. This could include translucent panels for navigation and circular app icons. The visionOS-inspired design will be made across Apple's entire ecosystem (including CarPlay) with the goal of creating a more cohesive experience.

Additionally, there are three apps expected to undergo the most changes — the Phone app, Camera, and Safari. For instance, the Phone app is rumored to introduce a new option that allows users to merge their favorite contacts, recent calls, and voicemails into a single view. Meanwhile, both the Camera app and Safari are anticipated to have more visual updates, such as a transparent address bar for Apple's browser app.

Apple is also rumored to be releasing a gaming app that will integrate Apple Arcade and the App Store's game offerings, featuring a central hub for achievements, leaderboards, and App Store content. This comes after the company acquired its first game studio, RAC7, according to DigitalTrends.

Apple may also be developing an AI feature to serve as a personal health coach. This new chatbot is expected to suggest lifestyle changes and provide health advice based on user data collected from the Health app. Additionally, the Health app may be revamped to include a food-tracking feature, allowing users to log their carbohydrate and caffeine intake.

Apple could improve iPhone battery health with AI-powered battery management. This new feature is reported to analyze device usage and make adjustments to conserve battery life. There may also be a new charging icon on the lock screen that gives an estimated time for when it's fully charged.

Another rumor suggests that reverse wireless charging is being tested on the iPhone 17 Pro models, allowing users to charge accessories such as AirPods or the Apple Watch directly from their iPhone.

According to 9to5Mac, the Messages app is set to get an Apple Intelligence-powered translation feature that can automatically translate messages as soon as they hit users' inboxes. 9to5Mac also reports that Apple Intelligence could power a polling feature that lets people in group chats vote and offers AI-generated poll suggestions. 

Additionally, Messages may also add the ability to set a background image, following in the footsteps of WhatsApp and Instagram.

Apple may bring its Preview app from macOS to iPad and iPhone users, allowing them to annotate and edit PDFs. This will reportedly be a preinstalled app, per Bloomberg.

As Bloomberg reports, Genmoji could gain a small yet exciting feature that allows users to combine existing standard emojis, such as a basketball going into a trash can. 

One notable absence from all the rumors is the impressive Siri capabilities highlighted in Apple's 2024 presentation, which featured a more context-aware assistant that can gather information and perform actions across different apps. The company stated in March that the new features are delayed. 

While we can expect some AI-related announcements, the primary focus is likely to be on design changes. Reports indicate that improvements to existing Apple Intelligence features will also be introduced, along with some new additions. 

This story was originally published June 3 and will be updated as more rumors come out.

Of all the words in the dictionary, Sarah Franklin says “balance” is perhaps her favorite — especially when it comes to companies embracing AI.

Franklin leads the Jack Altman-founded employee performance software company Lattice, which is now worth $3 billion. Both onstage at SXSW London and in conversation with TechCrunch, she spoke a lot about balance — the opportunities in finding it, and the risks of not having it during this AI revolution. 

“We put people first,” Franklin told TechCrunch, referring to Lattice, which has started to adopt more AI and automation features. 

Although some companies are touting AI as a way to replace massive numbers of workers, some tech leaders are speaking more openly about the importance of striking a balance at their companies: retaining human employees while augmenting them with AI assistants and “agents.” At SXSW London, Franklin said that looking to fully replace human workers might seem like a good idea in the short term for cost-saving reasons, but such a move might not actually be attractive to customers.

“It's important to ask yourself, ‘Are you building for the success of the AI first [or are] you building for the success of the people and your customers first?” she said, adding that trust is the most important currency any founder or startup company has, and that building trust with consumers is paramount. “It's good to have efficiency, but you don't want to trade out trust.” 

Franklin also stressed the importance of transparency, accountability, and responsibility when it comes to AI. Leaders need to be transparent with employees about what the AI is doing, the AI must be narrowly applied to a particular goal so people understand how it works, and humans must ultimately be held accountable for what the AI impacts. 

“Otherwise, we are then in service of the AI versus the AI being in service of us,” Franklin continued. 

In an interview with TechCrunch after her SXSW appearance, Franklin said Lattice has built an AI HR agent that gives proactive insights and assists employees in one-on-one meetings. The company also has a platform where Lattice clients can create their own custom agents for their businesses. 

Franklin was adamant that humans must have oversight of any AI technology implemented by a company. “It's a way to just have the regular checks and balances that we're used to in our workforce,” she told TechCrunch.

She thinks the victors in this AI moment in history will be the ones who learn how to put people first. According to Franklin, it's one of the most important guardrails that a company can have on AI. 

“We all have a responsibility to make sure that we're doing this for the people of society,” Franklin said. “Human connection cannot be replaced, and the winners are going to be the companies that understand that.”

A $1,520 saving doesn't make the price any less eye-watering


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


In the ever-evolving world of insane GPU prices, tariffs, and frightful stock shortages, one intrepid PC builder has managed to swipe an Nvidia RTX 5090 from Walmart for ""just"" $1,679, more than $200 below MSRP.

Redditor Sufficient_Crazy7758 took to the platform to hail their purchase of the ""Cheapest 5090 ever?"", after scooping a PNY GeForce RTX 5090 from Walmart for the relatively low price of $1,679.99. The attached images reveal that the card was discounted by over $1,500 on May 25, having previously been discounted on May 13.

""Just so all of you know, I bought this on that date and it has worked flawlessly ever since,"" they said triumphantly.

Naturally, commenters pressed to find out how they'd come about such a ludicrous bargain. ""Local Walmart, they said it was a 3rd party return and nobody bought it, so I jumped on it,"" they revealed.

Despite the jeopardy of buying a third-party return, the deal is so good that some even postulated whether the poster worked at Walmart and had marked down the price themselves before hiding the card long enough to mark it down again.

Buying up third-party returns is probably not the first port of call you should consider when shopping for the best graphics cards, but when it comes to the wild MSRPs of the top-end Nvidia RTX 50 series, and the even more expensive AIB options, maybe taking a risk is worth it, it certainly paid off for this customer.

The card in question appears to be the PNY triple fan (but not the EPIC-X ARGB) version, which retails at an astonishing $3,499 at Walmart. Despite launching all the way back in January, even the Founders Edition still retails for the same price, way over the $1,999 MSRP.

Nefecon, an oral targeted-release formulation of budesonide that targets drug release into the distal ileum, provided significant improvements in the loss of kidney function in patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) at 9 months, regardless of baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) status, according to a new subanalysis of the phase 3 NeflgArd study.

“This NefIgArd subanalysis demonstrated that the efficacy of a 9-month Nefecon treatment course in reduction of proteinuria and preservation of kidney function was independent of baseline eGFR,” said first author Jonathan Barratt, MD, of the College of Life Sciences, University of Leicester, UK.

“So, we should be confident about treating people with Nefecon across the full range of eGFR in terms of the eGFR saving we're going to see, but also the proteinuria reduction,” he added.

The findings were reported this week at the 62nd European Renal Association (ERA) Congress 2025.

The study was funded by Calliditas Therapeutics AB.

Disclosure: Arthur L. Caplan, PhD, has disclosed the following relevant financial relationships: Served as a director, officer, partner, employee, advisor, consultant, or trustee for: Johnson & Johnson's Panel for Compassionate Drug Use (unpaid position)Serves as a contributing author and advisor for: Medscape



This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hi. I'm Art Caplan. I'm at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, where I'm the head of the Division of Medical Ethics. 

The state that I live in, Connecticut, has seen some very interesting legislative proposals recently around cell phone use. Many other states — New York, New Jersey, and many others — are having similar debates.The Connecticut one, I think, is the furthest along of them all. 

It becomes important because I think parents ask questions about cell phone use for their kids. What should I be thinking? Should I restrict it? Is it dangerous? What should I do? 

The state of Connecticut wants to help. First, they've proposed legislation to pull cell phones out of schools — at least kindergarten up through high school — to get the cell phones taken away from the kids so that they're not distracted and that they're paying attention to the teacher and also engaged in social interaction. 

Even more radically, there's a proposal in Connecticut, a bill that would ban in young children from being able to access social media platforms, iPads, cell phones, or whatever between midnight and 6:00 AM. Is this a good idea?

A colleague of mine at NYU, Jonathan Haidt, wrote a book called The Anxious Generation. He believes that the rates we see of teenagers who are now experiencing anxiety, which has increased from 2010 to today from 1 in 10 to 1 in 4; the number of teenagers experiencing depression, which has gone up from 1 in 10 to 1 in 5; and even death by suicide, one of the leading causes of deathfor kids aged 15-24, have to do with social media. 

Harassment, peer pressure, and getting stalked and bombarded with messages that attack self-esteem, target young people, and make them feel bad about their bodies can absolutely create mental health disorders. 

Is there sufficient evidence in his book?Do we have sufficient evidence from other studies to say for sure it's the cell phone or the iPad that somebody's looking at late at night?

I'm going to concede that we don't. There's suggestive evidence, but not really many gold-standard studies that say, yes, it's the cell phone, iPad, or computerand where they are on social media. 

On the other hand, I support these legislative efforts, like Connecticut's, to get the cell phones out of school, to get kids talking to one another, to get them paying attention more, and to do what we can to get them off [of their devices] in the middle of the night. 

I would look at it this way.[Cell phones] may be causing problems by giving access to disturbing social media outlets. Let's face it, social media is a cesspool at this point, a sewer all over the place, and the companies that run it are doing nothing to self-regulate it. If we're wrong, the worst that happened is [kids] are not online for certain parts of the day.

I know parents sometimes say, well, what about if there's a shooting or an emergency at school? I think we can manage that. You can absolutely have teachers with cell phones. The staff can have cell phones. It's not that there wouldn't be any ability to alert the police or to allow some communication as necessary with the kids.I don't think the rarity of a school shooting, as much as we worry about it, is enough to say, yes, let's let the kids just get lost all day long at school in their cell phones. 

I also understand why people are asking how this is going to really be enforced. Maybe it will be possible at school when you ask the kids to turn the cell phones in and lock them up or put them in a pouch where the teacher has the code or something.How is that enforceable at home at night? 

One of the things missing, I think, from these efforts in Connecticut and elsewhere to decrease access by young kids to social media is the use of parental controls. I think some social platforms do a pretty good job saying before you give that cell phone to your kid or let them have their own computer, you're going to be able to program it with social parental discretion controls. Other platforms don't seem to care.

Let's set some standards and expectations about what parents could do and would be able to do to restrict access at different times. It's going to take an across-the-board effort from parents, government requirements, and a willingness of people who control social mediato try to make sure that kids aren't getting in trouble, but we have to really start to take steps. 

We've got a problem in just saying there's nothing we could do about it, like the horse is out of the barn. That's not a response. 

I support the Connecticut effort. We'll see. I don't think federal government's going to be moving in this area anytime soon.They seem oriented toward deregulation. I think many states may, and I think that's something that, as physicians, we should try to support. Less access to social media at certain times of the day and night is not a bad thing for kids. 

I'm Art Caplan. I'm at the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.Thanks for watching.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Crepidiastrum denticulatum, a member of the Asteraceae family that is also known as Youngia denticulatum, is traditionally consumed as a vegetable in Korea. The plant is known to confer antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity as well as protective effects. Air pollutants exact a toll on the skin, promoting the development of acne, atopic dermatitis, pigmentary changes, and wrinkles. C denticulatum is seen on skin cream labels as Pollux CD to help shield the skin against various stressors found in air pollution, including particulate matter, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons containing benzo[a]pyrene, heavy metals, and ultraviolet (UV) B radiation. C denticulatum is included in anti-aging skin care (and found in Zerafite Wrinkle Defense Barrier Cream) because it has been found to increase autophagy and decrease cellular senescence. This column focuses on the available evidence that supports the use of this natural extract in skin care.

In 2019, Yoon et al. screened numerous natural extracts to quantify their autophagy activation efficacy in cultured dermal fibroblasts, given the spate of evidence that autophagy activation can protect the skin from oxidation-induced cellular damage and signs of aging. Cells treated by C denticulatum extracts demonstrated the greatest autophagic vacuole development in the noncytotoxic range. The investigators reported that C denticulatum treatment yielded the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate kinase, although it did not suppress the mammalian target of rapamycin. They also assessed the anti-pollution activity of the extract using model substances, benzo[a]pyrene and cadmium chloride, with the C denticulatum extract treatment of the skin, particularly as anti-inflammatory, antipollution cosmetic agents.

In 2020, Park et al. studied the influence of various UVB radiation levels on the development of the functional constituents of C denticulatum. They observed that none of the UVB levels (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.25 W m-2) conferred negative effects on shoot dry weight after 6 days of 6-h exposure. Shoot fresh weight was suppressed by the higher energy treatments (1.0 and 1.25 W m-2). Total carotenoid content was elevated by 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 W m-2 energy levels. Antioxidant capacity, hydroxycinnamic acid content, and multiple sesquiterpenes were augmented on day 4 by 0.25 W m-2 treatment. The researchers determined that they had identified the potential of 0.25 W m-2 UVB to efficiently synthesize bioactive constituents of C denticulatum without suppressing growth.

In a 2015 study, Kim et al. investigated the impact of various youngiaside extracts on extrinsic aging. In evaluating the molecular mechanisms of the extracts in UVB-irradiated HaCaT keratinocytes and human dermal fibroblasts, they found that the C denticulatum constituents reduced matrix metalloproteinase expression and production. Collagen expression and synthesis were also increased in human dermal fibroblasts. Furthermore, the investigators observed that the extracts significantly enhanced the antioxidant enzyme expression, thus down-regulating the reactive oxygen species generated by UVB exposure. Other notable results included decreased phosphorylation of I-kappa-B-alphaand IKK alpha/beta , suppressed nuclear factor kappa-B (NF kappa-B) p65 nuclear translocation, and robust inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators. The investigators concluded that the tested substances found in C denticulatum have the potential to prevent and treat cutaneous aging.

In 2014, Ahn et al. found that an ethanol extract of C denticulatum significantly shielded retinal ganglion cells from eradication caused by optic nerve crush in a mouse model of glaucoma. They also determined that the primary active constituents of the herbal extract were the hydroxycinnamic acids chicoric acid and 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, which have demonstrated the capacity to protect from retinal damage in multiple in vivo and in vitro studies.

Later in 2014, Yoo et al. reported on the antioxidant and detoxifying activity of C denticulatum extracts. The researchers found that the botanical agent exerted hepatoprotective benefits against chronic alcohol-induced liver damage in rats. Specifically, rats treated with C denticulatum experienced substantial attenuation of fatty liver symptoms, with normalization of antioxidative capacity and lipid peroxidation of the liver. The functions of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase were also restored through treatment with C denticulatum.

More recently, in 2018, the oral administration of a C denticulatum extract was found to exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity in  improving acute renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice. 

Research indicates that C denticulatum, a plant traditionally consumed as food in Korea, displays antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. These health benefits may also be derived by the topical application of the extracts of this botanical agent. Research remains sparse at this point, suggesting that such effects reside more in the realm of the theoretical than the actual. Nevertheless, C denticulatum extract is used as a cosmeceutical ingredient (Pollux CD) that appears to protect the skin from air pollution. Given current use and the potential for wider applications, more research is necessary to evaluate available products and to ascertain the role or roles for which C denticulatum is most suited to improve skin health.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Herculez Gomez and Ryan O'Hanlon compare the USMNT's striker options ahead of the World Cup. (0:55)

HARTFORD, Conn. -- United States men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino said it's important to not pay too much attention to the circumstances surrounding his squad selection for the Concacaf Gold Cup, but rather to ""trust in the roster"" and provide an environment for the players to ""fight for a place"" on the World Cup.

Pochettino's preparations for the Gold Cup -- which includes a friendly against Turkey on Saturday -- have been hampered by a number of players rendered unavailable.

These include AC Milan attacker Christian Pulisic (fatigue), Fulham defender Antonee Robinson (knee surgery), PSV Eindhoven defender Sergiño Dest (continued recovery from ACL surgery) as well as the Juventus duo of Weston McKennie and Tim Weah (Club World Cup commitments).

What was hoped to be an extended period with his best players ahead of next year's World Cup on home soil, has turned into something very different. Pochettino has been forced to mine the depths of the USMNT player pool, with the 26-player Gold Cup roster including seven uncapped players and another seven with fewer than five international appearances.

""We need to adapt to the circumstance and I think it's important not to pay too much attention [to them],"" Pochettino told reporters on Friday. ""It's only to try to believe and to provide the players a good environment for them to perform and fight for a place and to be in the World Cup in one year.

""Of course different players that maybe with the opportunity to be here, are not here [in this] circumstance, but we cannot change that reality.""

When asked if he thought that the current roster was good enough to win the Gold Cup, Pochettino declined to answer, instead focusing on the opportunity that the players have in front of them.

""I think it's a great opportunity for us to settle things. That sometimes is difficult when you only have few days to train and you need to play,"" he said. ""I think now it's a great opportunity to be together during one month ... And then we will see.

""Always it's about the opportunity you need to provide the opportunity to the player and the player maybe can take or not. But the important thing now is to trust in this roster and try to compete believing that we can win.""

Pochettino has leveled some thinly veiled criticisms at the USMNT about the attitude in shown in prior gatherings. U.S. World Cup captain Tyler Adams said that Pochettino has communicated to this group what he expects.

""I think that the mentality has to be set clear, and I think [Pochettino] has made that clear since day one, that we're here to work,"" Adams said. ""We're here to enjoy ourselves on the pitch, get better every single day, learn what we have to go through.

""We're traveling all over the place; we're obviously playing abroad and we come back home and it is nice to see your families. But we have to find the right balance of that.

""And I think when he speaks to that, he means we need to find the balance of doing the work on the field, making sure we're doing the work and when we have downtime to rest in the appropriate way so that we're able to recover for the matches.

""So yeah, he talks about balance quite a lot and make sure that we understand that we need to be top professionals. That's the most important thing.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

International Football

EAST HARTFORD, Conn. – The U.S. men's national team that will take the field here on Saturday against Turkey — and in this summer's Concacaf Gold Cup — will look far different than what would have been expected a year ago. Or, really, even just a few weeks ago.

No Christian Pulisic. He's out after requesting a rest.

No Antonee Robinson (knee surgery), Folarin Balogun (ankle) or Ricardo Pepi (knee). No Yunus Musah (personal reasons) and no Weston McKennie, Tim Weah or Gio Reyna (FIFA Club World Cup). No Sergiño Dest, who was deemed by the U.S. staff to need more time to recover from his knee injury, or Zack Steffen, who left camp with a knee injury of his own.

That's a lot of ‘no's.

So, yes, it's fair to say that the challenge has been a bit different than Mauricio Pochettino and his staff expected when they took the job after last year's Copa América failure. Unforeseen hurdles are to be expected in any job, though.

“The truth is that whenever you start a new project, you're always expecting you might find something,” Pochettino said. “It's very difficult to foresee the situations that might arise later. The people who contact you and explain a little to you always have a different point of view. But when you're inside, you're already soaking in what's happening — like what's happening this year, what the situation is, the reality you're facing. … We know in soccer that circumstances are the circumstances that exist, and prejudging before arriving somewhere might not do it justice. It's not the reality [you'll face]. So we're always prepared.”

It is undoubtedly better that these circumstances are playing out in summer 2025 rather than summer 2026. The absences of players who would typically be expected on a national team roster have opened the door for other players.

It will give a chance for the likes of Real Salt Lake's Diego Luna, Charlotte FC's Patrick Agyemang, Orlando City's Alex Freeman and PSV's Malik Tillman to grab hold of a job.

“When these things happen, there are also many positives,” Pochettino said in an interview with Andrés Cantor on his radio network, Fútbol de Primera. Because there are many players who will have the opportunity to be with us, and many players who we thought might need a lot more time, under these circumstances, these players can have the opportunity — and why not? Some of these players will surprise us and become important players a year from now for the World Cup.”

It's fair to say that the door isn't just open because players are absent.

The “stars” of this group failed to get out of the group stage at Copa América. It was the ‘A' team that lost to both Panama and Canada at the Concacaf Nations League in March. There is also an opportunity there because this U.S. team, with all its enormous expectations, is underperforming.

The group in camp is not blind to that reality.

“I don't think there's any denying that some of our performances have fallen short over the past year to 18 months,” said center back Walker Zimmerman, who started multiple games for the U.S. at the 2022 World Cup. “It's something that you know us as players, we obviously aren't satisfied with, and it's a big focus, big focal point for this camp. And I think when you look at Gold Cup, and you look at some players maybe having their first experience with Gold Cup, or even young guys coming into the team in general, it's always such a great opportunity to have a month in front of a staff, get a lot of quality trainings in together, and find yourself, hopefully getting into a rhythm of playing multiple games where you can put everything on the line to try and make a World Cup team in a year's time. So it's a massive opportunity, one that I think every player should take seriously with both hands.”

In short: Jobs are up for grabs this summer.

But beyond just the year-long vision ahead of next summer's World Cup, there is a more immediate task at hand. The team in this Gold Cup has an opportunity to flip the mood around the U.S. team.

Things are about as pessimistic and negative around the U.S. as they have been over the previous two cycles. A team that had so much momentum coming out of the 2022 World Cup now feels like it's headed for an early exit at a home World Cup that was supposed to be the program's big moment.

The expectations around the 2026 tournament were upped when the federation fired former coach Gregg Berhalter and hired Pochettino, but the results haven't yet improved.

While this group may be a ‘B' team, there is still a need for results that might inject some belief back into the fan base.

U.S. goalkeeper Matt Turner was part of the 2021 Gold Cup squad that followed the ‘A' team's win in the Nations League with a title of their own. That win reinforced that this national team pool might be capable of something special.

“I'd be lying if I didn't say lifting that trophy on the final day would be what we consider success,” Turner said. “That's the standard that we've set for ourselves. But at the same time things happen in soccer, and I think what we need to control is what we bring to the table every single day, the intensity, the way we push each other, the passion, the energy, the connection with the fans, the connection with each other, the connection with the staff. We're going to be together for a long period of time right now, and it's a really good opportunity for us to put a lot of things together: tactically, technically, emotionally.”

Turner knows firsthand, though, what a Gold Cup can mean. He credited that 2021 tournament with helping him solidify his place on the World Cup roster — and Turner ended up winning the starting job over Steffen.

That outcome is somewhat of a program tradition. Since 1993, at least one player who had five caps or fewer on the Gold Cup roster in the year ahead of a World Cup went on to make the World Cup roster the following year.

“There's a lot of guys here with a big opportunity to show the coaching staff and the fans who are desperate to see that passion and that energy,” Turner said. “They have a really good opportunity to make a case for themselves to be on that World Cup squad and be a contributing member to this team for years to come.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Exclusive Mikel John Obi Interview: Osimhen, Chelsea and Club World Cup DAZN Role","https://www.givemesport.com/exclusive-mikel-john-obi-chelsea-club-world-cup-moises-caicedo-victor-osimhen/","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 15:36:00 GMT","

Former Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel is advising his fellow Nigerian Victor Osimhen to move to the Premier League this summer and turn down a lucrative move to Saudi side Al-Hilal.

Osimhen - described as being ""world-class"" by Jose Mourinho - is yet to agree terms with Al-Hilal, and is also being courted by Galatasaray, where he spent last season on loan. Chelsea and Manchester United have been heavily linked as well, with the Blues attempting to sign Osimhen on deadline day last summer.

 ""I think Chelsea have decided to go in a different direction now,"" said Mikel, speaking to GIVEMESPORT ahead of the Club World Cup where he's working as a pundit for the tournament's exclusive global broadcaster DAZN.

""Liam Delap has now come in, but I have always said if Chelsea signed Osimhen, he'd come in and hit the ground running straight away. I hope this happens with Delap as well, and that his arrival brings the best out of Nicolas Jackson. I want to see a great partnership between both of them, pushing each other in training and on the field.

What I really want for Victor, is to see him in the Premier League. I want to see him play for Chelsea, his boyhood club. He grew up with Didier Drogba as his idol.

I would love to see him play at Stamford Bridge. And then there's Manchester United or maybe even Arsenal who could be in the market for him.

""Unsurprisingly, Victor is a guy in demand. He's not short of options this summer. I can tell you, Saudi Arabian clubs have been chasing him for a very long time. They made so many offers in previous windows, and yet he refused to go.

""I told him, 'You still have time to play in Saudi one day, so just stay in Europe for now and come to a top club like Chelsea!' I think the best thing for Victor right now is to fight for Premier League and Champions League titles. And then, maybe after three or four years, go to Saudi.

""It's hard to turn down the kind of money on offer there. You're talking about up to €50 million a season. That's crazy! It's life-changing money. But filling your trophy cabinet is equally important. As a top footballer, you want to finish your career knowing you won the biggest trophies. Let's see what happens. But of course, if Al-Hilal can convince him, we'll see Victor at the Club World Cup and that will be exciting.""

 DAZN struck a $1 billion deal for the global broadcast rights to all 63 games of the inaugural Club World Cup, which starts on June 14 as Lionel Messi's Inter Miami take on Egyptian champions Al-Ahly at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium.

Should Osimhen join Al-Hilal, which is certainly not a given, he'll make his debut in a flagship fixture against Real Madrid. It will be the first game in charge of new Hilal boss Simone Inzaghi and Real coach Xabi Alonso, while Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dean Huijsen could be handed their Real debuts.

Chelsea, meanwhile, begin against Los Angeles FC in Atlanta in a match that will see French striker Olivier Giroud come up against his former club, while Manchester City open the tournament against Moroccan side Wydad in Philadelphia.

And newly-crowned Champions League winners PSG have the toughest opening fixture of all on paper as they face Atletico Madrid at the Rose Bowl Stadium in California.

 ""When you look at all the fixtures, it's hard not to get excited,"" said Mikel. ""I am over the moon to be involved with DAZN at such a massive tournament. DAZN are making some big moves in football, and the Club World Cup is going to be groundbreaking.

""I can't wait to see the PSG-Atletico game. What a job Luis Enrique has done, and Diego Simeone will relish trying to tactically outdo him. And all football fans want to see Lionel Messi on such a big stage.

""I am also looking forward to seeing some of the non-European teams, like Al-Ahly, Al-Hilal or Auckland City. I really hope we see a team, perhaps with slightly less of a global profile, that will just surprise everyone and set the tournament on fire.

 ""And of course, there's Chelsea, who I believe can win the competition. It's a chance to get another new trophy having just won the Europa Conference League for the first time. And visually, what a trophy it is to get your hands on. You need a key to open it! It's truly one of a kind. Even the World Cup trophy doesn't have that.

""I would have loved to win this trophy. I think the players will be really incentivised and there is massive financial gain at stake for the clubs as well. Every single group-stage win earns clubs $2 million, and winning the tournament is worth $125m, and some of that money might go straight into the transfer window this summer.""

 Chelsea come off the back of beating Real Betis 4-1 in Poland to win the Europa Conference League, and in doing so became the first ever club to win every piece of major domestic European silverware.

Now they stand a chance of being crowned the inaugural winners of the Club World Cup. The champion will also get a special gold badge which they can wear on their kit for four years until the 2029 edition of the tournament. Yet however Chelsea fare in America, Mikel believes securing Champions League football has already made Enzo Maresca's first season in charge a success.

""The season started well for Chelsea and I thought, 'OK, we're right up there!',"" said Mikel, who made 372 appearances for Chelsea and won 11 trophies, including two Premier League titles and the 2012 Champions League. ""But then we faded away over the festive period. I actually think that poor run was a much-needed welcome call.

""In my day, we knew the festive period was important because you could take a big step towards winning the Premier League. Chelsea's young squad just went off the boil and lost a bit of focus. All credit to them, though, because they recovered and finished in a Champions League spot and won the Europa Conference League. That means there is real confidence and momentum ahead of the Club World Cup.""

 Mikel has been particularly impressed by fellow midfielder Moises Caicedo, who was named Chelsea's Player of the Season after starting all 38 Premier League games this season. Caicedo made 114 tackles, 49 interceptions, 53 clearances, 229 recoveries and won 236 duels. And the Ecuador international even scored in the Europa Conference League Final.

Chelsea have a competitive midfield with Caicedo, Romeo Lavia and Enzo Fernandez competing for spots alongside Cole Palmer. Reece James has also been used in the centre of the park, while Dario Essugo will also join this summer from Sporting and Mathis Amogou has also been part of several match-day squads.

 ""Peak Mikel in 2012 or 2013 would still get into this Chelsea midfield, despite the obvious quality they have,"" he said. ""I'd pick myself over those guys. But all the midfielders' performances have been fantastic.

Caicedo is exceptional. He's grown into his position and plays with no fear. He breaks up play. He's very aggressive on the ball. You can see he's fighting for the shirt and for the club and wants to win games and trophies.

He looks like he could be captain of the football club one day, that's how highly I rate him right now. I just want to see him be even more vocal, leading with his voice not just his feet.

""I would also single out Enzo Fernandez. He didn't start the season well, but he finished it very strongly. He's started scoring goals, creating chances and is now one of Chelsea's main guys. And we all know Romeo Lavia when fit is outstanding. But I think there is still room for another box-to-box or ball-carrying midfielder, and Reece James is best as a right back in my opinion.""

Although Caicedo won Chelsea's Player of the Season, Mikel has also singled out Marc Cucurella. The 26-year-old struggled initially following a £62 million switch from Brighton in August 2022, but has been a near automatic starter following an impressive Euro 2024 last summer as Spain beat England to win the trophy. Cucurella managed a career-high seven goals in a single season in 2024/25, with a particularly important header in Chelsea's 1-0 win over Manchester United in May keeping them on track for Champions League qualification.

 ""There was this whole narrative around Chelsea being 'Cole Palmer FC', and what a signing he's been, but it's Marc Cucurella who has really impressed me this season, both defensively and offensively,"" said Mikel, who hosts the popular Obi One Podcast. ""When he first joined I must admit I thought, 'Oh, what the hell is going on here?' But Chelsea were patient with him and that's paid off, and he now plays with such confidence and personality. Cucurella is getting better with every game and even chipping in with important goals. He seems like the kind of player that will love the challenge of winning the Club World Cup.""

Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson will also be out to prove a point in America, especially now he faces competition from new £30m Chelsea forward Liam Delap. Jackson got 13 goals last season in all competitions, four less than in his first season at the club, albeit he played in 11 games less compared to 2023/24.

Jackson also came under criticism after being foolishly sent off in May's 2-0 loss at Newcastle for an elbow on Sven Botman. Mikel has previously questioned Jackson's ability as a natural finisher, but still feels the Senegal striker can become a top player for Chelsea.

""Nicolas has big potential and I never intended to disrespect him with previous comments,"" said Mikel, who scored six goals during his own time at Chelsea. ""You can see there is a player there. He's good on the ball, quick and can run in behind. And he stretches defenders, which gives Cole Palmer more space. Now it's just about finishing more chances, and I actually think the competition with Delap will help him improve further. He needs to score more goals, and hopefully Delap's arrival with cause a positive reaction.

Christopher Nkunku should also be a source of goals, but to be honest I think his time at the club is now done. I genuinely think he needs to move on.

There was a lot of hype about him when he joined from Leipzig. I was so excited when he arrived, but his time at Chelsea hasn't panned out well.

""Injuries haven't helped and you can see he doesn't like being played out of position. He's not a striker, he's a number ten. But of course, when you have Palmer in that position, you can't just take him out the side. It's time to sell Nkunku, get some money and then invest in a wide attacker. I am not so sure replacing Nkunku with another striker is wise because it's not good to have three established strikers all fighting for one position.""

 Unsurprisingly, Mikel is predicting Chelsea to win the Club World Cup and tipping Boca Junior as a dark horse to watch. He also expects Trent Alexander-Arnold to make a statement after joining Real Madrid from Liverpool for €10m, while Erling Haaland is Mikel's pick to claim the golden boot.

The Club World Cup promises drama and global match-ups never seen before, and it is likely one of the European heavyweights will end up lifting the trophy for the very first time and in doing so walk away with Champions League-type money earned over just four compelling weeks of football.

""Apart from Chelsea, I am actually most excited to see Boca Juniors play, and they have a great game against Bayern Munich in their group. Their fans are going to be incredible. I can't wait to see them inside the stadium and I hope they go really far.

 ""Manchester City are a bit of an unpredictable team to judge at the moment. I think Haaland will end up top scorer and that should set up a good run for them. Pep Guardiola is trying to put things right after a disappointing season and this is his chance to get a trophy and sort of salvage things. Although an established side, Manchester City could be a bit of an unknown quantity because Kevin De Bruyne will likely have left, Jack Grealish isn't going to be in the squad and a few new faces should come in before their first game [against Wydad].

""As for Trent, he's going to want to make an instant impression on Xabi Alonso and his debut will draw global attention, so it's going to be special to cover that on DAZN. Obviously, Trent's been at Liverpool for almost 20 years, won everything and did so much for his boyhood club. I know many Liverpool fans will disagree with me, but I just think that now it's time to celebrate him, including what he's achieved at Anfield.

 ""Let's let go of the negativity around his departure. Remember, it wasn't only Trent leaving, Liverpool also let his contract run down, and it wasn't an ideal situation. But it's time to move on, and Trent announcing himself as a Real Madrid player at the Club World Cup can help do that.

It's going to be a bit weird seeing him play in white instead of all red, but I do think he could be one of the players of the tournament.

""And then I obviously predict Chelsea to win the whole thing! I think we can all see now that the project is now heading in the right direction. All these talented young players are starting to gel together as a team, and they have a good manager that knows how to handle and improve them. I like Enzo Maresca a lot. He needs to stay at the football club. We are only a couple of players short of being able to really compete for all the top trophies, but I would still like to see a bit more experience added this summer.

""I want to see us take the Club World Cup seriously and win it. I want to see Chelsea's best players performing at this tournament because doing so would round off an amazing season. And you simply can't win this tournament without beating some outstanding teams along the way. So, if Chelsea can become the first-ever Club World Cup champions, it would be a huge boost heading into next season, when I think we might start to get back to the Chelsea I remember, that always competed for and won silverware with regularity. And to leave America with a new gold badge on the shirt would be a constant reminder to all these young players every time they put the shirt on, and for four years, that Chelsea is a club for serial winners and nothing less.""

The three kits to be introduced to the Manchester City squad for the FIFA Club World Cup have now surfaced on social media, while remaining unreleased at present.

Pep Guardiola and his Manchester City players are due to return to first-team training from Monday ahead of the inaugural new edition of the Club World Cup – rebranded and expanded from the version that City claimed back in 2023.

32 teams from across the globe will head to the United States with vast sums of prize money on offer as well as the tag of being the greatest club side on the planet, with Manchester City's place at the tournament confirmed via their UEFA Champions League win in Istanbul.

     

But alongside the sporting merits on offer, there is also a staggering commercial gain to be had by clubs, and it seems as though decision makers within the Etihad Stadium and at manufacturers Puma are keen to capitalise.

Despite only recently unveiling the brand new traditional sky blue and white home kit for the 2025/26 season, it is believed that Manchester City will unveil a further range of strips for the Stateside tournament later this month.

As revealed by Opaleak, Manchester City will have two unique shirts to be worn by their outfield players at the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup, both of which feature sash designs while one will invoke memories of the 2010/11 third kit.

The likes of Ederson and Stefan Ortega Moreno will also be handed their own unique jersey and strip for the competition, as they will likely star in a bright combination of pink and purple in the United States.

It remains to be seen how many new Manchester City stars will also be on show in the brand new shirts and kits at the upcoming Club World Cup, with two deals expected to be finalised and completed this weekend alone.

The last few days have seen Etihad Stadium officials intensify their efforts of strengthening Pep Guardiola's side ahead of the new season, with a strong intention of bringing in fresh faces in time for the US-based tournament.

Among the faces expected to be ready and available after completing their respective transfers from AC Milan and Wolverhampton Wanderers are central midfielder Tijjani Reijnders, as well as left-sided full-back Rayan Ait-Nouri.

City will also be hopeful of finalising and completing an arrangement with Lyon to recruit France international playmaker Rayan Cherki, particularly after his stellar showing against Spain in the UEFA Nations League on Thursday night.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

FIFA Club World Cup

The 2025 Club World Cup, which is taking place in the United States, gets underway on June 14 and runs until July 13.

It is a revamped and bigger version of the old tournament, which was first played in 2000. Teams from six continents and 20 countries are competing, with all of them — some more realistically than others — aiming to be crowned club world champions in New Jersey in the middle of next month.

Here, The Athletic explains how the competition works, what the schedule is, the rules surrounding squad numbers and suspensions and much more.

There are 32 teams playing in the tournament. All six of FIFA's confederations are being represented, with 12 clubs from UEFA (Europe), six from CONMEBOL (South America), five from Concacaf (North America), four from AFC (Asia), four from CAF (Africa) and one from OFC (Oceania).

Brazil are the country with the most different clubs participating (four: Botafogo, Flamengo, Fluminense and Palmeiras), with the U.S. the only other nation providing more than two teams (three: Inter Miami, Los Angeles FC and Seattle Sounders).

For all of the groups and the full fixture list, click here.



The 32 teams have been split into eight groups of four, with every team playing the other three sides in their group once. Three points will be awarded for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss. The top two teams in each group (by total number of points) will advance to the knockout stage, and the bottom two will be eliminated.

If one or more teams are level at the end of the group stage, their finishing position will be determined by points obtained in the matches between the sides in question, not goal difference, like at the World Cup. If they still can't be separated after this then various other head-to-head; then group-wide tiebreakers will be applied, all the way down to the drawing of lots.

The knockout stage consists of a round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals and final. All these matches are one-off straight knockout ties, with the winner advancing and the loser being eliminated. If teams are level after normal time in any of these knockout matches, then an additional 30 minutes of extra time will be played, split over two halves. If there is still no winner, then a penalty shootout will determine who advances.

The 32-team, eight-groups-of-four system is the same that was used at the World Cup from 1998 to 2022. However, unlike at the World Cup, there will be no third-place play-off for the losing semi-finalists in the club version this summer.

Group stage: June 14-26
Round of 16: June 28-July 1
Quarter-finals: July 4-5
Semi-finals: July 8-9
Final: July 13

All dates shown are according to the schedule on U.S. Eastern Time



After the group stage, the 16 teams that have qualified will be split, with eight on each side of the draw (called a bracket). There will be four group winners and four runners-up in each half.

All eight of the ties in the round of 16 will see a winner play a second-placed team from another group. The winner of Group A plays the runner-up in Group B, and the winner of Group B plays the runner-up in Group A. It is the same with Groups C and D, Groups E and F and Groups G and H.

The eight winners of these ties will advance to the quarter-finals, where they will face a team on their side of the draw for a place in the semi-finals. The same applies in the last four, with the winners reaching the final.

In the group stage, teams from every confederation apart from UEFA have been kept apart and therefore will not meet.

Four of the eight groups contain two UEFA clubs, meaning that Paris Saint-Germain vs Atletico Madrid, Benfica vs Bayern Munich, Juventus vs Manchester City and Red Bull Salzburg vs Real Madrid are the only same-confederation clashes in the first round.

Once the knockout stage begins, teams can play an opponent from any confederation, including their own.

Not in the group stage, but in the knockout stage they can.

Teams are permitted to have up to 35 players in their squad at the start of the tournament (and must have a minimum of 26). At least three of the squad members must be goalkeepers.

However, given that standard player contracts in European club football run from July 1 to June 30, FIFA have inserted a mid-tournament registration window — June 27 to July 3 — in which teams may replace players whose deals have expired. They can also add up to two extra players during this period, meaning from the start of the knockout stage onwards, clubs may have up to 37 men in their squad. Overall, teams can make a maximum of six changes to their squad during this seven-day window.

Each team will be permitted 26 players in their matchday squad: 11 starters and 15 substitutes.

Teams will be allowed to make a maximum of five substitutions in each match, as well as a concussion replacement if necessary. If games go to extra time, then each side will be allowed to make up to six substitutions, regardless of how many they made in normal time.

If a player (or member of the coaching staff) receives a yellow card in two separate games up to and including the quarter-finals, they will not be allowed to participate in the next match. There is an amnesty at the semi-final stage. Yellows picked up in previous matches will be ignored, meaning someone can only miss the final if they receive a red card in the semi-final.

If an individual receives a red card (either a direct one or via two yellow cards), they will be banned from the next match, regardless of the stage of the tournament. If the offence is deemed serious enough by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee, they may be suspended for more than one game.

The next Club World Cup will take place in 2029; like the World Cup, it will be held every four years. The hosts of the next edition are yet to be decided.

                        Richarlison of Brazil warms up prior to the FIFA World Cup 2026 Qualifier match between Ecuador and Brazil at Estadio Monumental Isidro Romero Carbo on June 05, 2025 in Guayaquil, Ecuador.

Catch Sportstar's highlights of the Ecuador vs Brazil FIFA World Cup 2026 CONMEBOL qualifier at the Banco Pichincha Monumental Stadium.

Brazil remains in fourth place with 22 points; it faces next third-placed Paraguay, which won 2–0 against Uruguay earlier. 

The 15th round of the FIFA World Cup 2026 CONMEBOL qualifiers is underway as teams from South America race towards booking a spot in football's biggest competition. 

Brazil, which is fourth with 22 points in 15 matches, remains a firm favourite to go through because the top six teams in the CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers secure direct qualification, while the seventh-place team enters the intercontinental playoffs.

It is just one of those underwhelming contests that make it a difficult watch for both fans and neutrals. The first-half had one clear-cut goalscoring chance but the second 45, had none.

It is not the best of starts for Carlo Ancelotti as Brazil manager, but with just one game in, it would be harsh to make any judgements.

Brazil will next play Paraguay on June 11, and Ecuador will take on Peru.

The referee blows his final whistle and the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier between Ecuador and Brazil finishes goalless and both teams will share a point. 

Estupinan drives forward and takes a shot at goal. However, he fails to keep his effort on target. 

Brazil sub: IN- Pereira OUT- Guimaraes

Six minutes added at the end of the second-half!

Ecuador sub: IN- Medina OUT- Angulo 

It has been an underwhelming contest, to say the least. Barring any last-minute surprises, nothing much to say about this match in terms of excitement. 

Brazil sub: IN- Santos OUT- Gerson 

Ecuador sub: IN- Rodriguez OUT - Yeboah 

Estupinan goes for a shot from distance and forces a save from Alisson, who does well to hold onto the ball and prevent a goal scoring chance from a rebound. 

A cutback from the left allows Casemiro to open the face of his boot and go for a shot from the edge of the box. Casemiro gets a good connection with the ball but Valle remains alert to get down quickly and make the save. 

Caicedo finds Estupinan on the left, and the latter wastes no time in sending a low cross at the near post. Angulo tries to reach the ball but loses the race to Alisson, who does well to anticipate the danger. 

A good spell of pressure from Brazil in and around the Ecuador box but the Selecao are not being able to find that final ball to create scoring opportunities. 

Brazil subs: IN- Martinelli, Cunha OUT - Estevao, Richarlison

A dangerous cross comes inside the Brazil box from the left but Casemiro is in a good position to intercept the danger and clear the ball away. 

We should see both managers making use of their substitutes as the match hits the hour mark and scores remain at 0-0. 

Ecuador has already made a half-time change bringing on Preciado in place of Minda. 

Vinicius Jr shows quick feet to keep the ball on the left goal line. He sends the ball to Guimaraes with a cutback, who goes for a first-time shot at goal. However, his effort is blocked as Ecuador gets the ball to safety. 

The tempo of the match has slowed down. Right now, it is mostly a midfield battle. 

Ecuador has yet again made a brighter start in the second half, as Brazil has mostly resorted to defending in the early minutes. 

Ecuador sub: IN- Preciado OUT- Minda

The match remains goalless as the second-half gets underway at the Banco Pichincha Monumental Stadium.

There is hardly much to say from this half. It has not been a bland half but nothing too exciting has been offered by either team. Vinicius Jr's chance in the 22nd minute, where his shot was saved by Valle, was the closest either team has come to finding the net.

Brazil's 18-year-old forward Estevao has been a bright presence in the forward with his direct runs in the final third, but the more experienced forwards like Vinicius Jr and Richarlison have not impressed in the first 45. 

Scores remain level at 0-0 as the referee blows the half-time whistle!

One minute added at the end of the first half!

With half-time nearing, it is difficult to pick a winner in this match. Both teams have shown positive signs in the final third. Better finishing will be the main agenda of both teams. 

Estupinan finds Yeboah with a cross from the left, but the latter's header is not on target. It was a difficult chance as the ball came at Yeboah with a fair amount of speed, which made it difficult for him to control the ball. 

Brazil is going forward with a lot more ease now than it was in the early minutes of the first-half. This time, Vinicius Jr makes a darting run from the left and tries to get past his marker Caicedo, but the midfielder shows his defensive skills by reading Vinicius' ploy and pokes the ball out for a corner.

Another positive run from Estevao as he makes his way inside the Ecuador box and tries to find a teammate in the middle with a low cross. But Hincapie does well to keep the youngster under pressure, whose cross is collected by the keeper. 

Estupinan swings a dangerous cross inside the Brazil box from a freekick. Alisson comes out to punch the ball but misses. There is a scramble at the backline as Brazil sends the ball out for a corner.

Yeboah tries his luck from an ambitious distance, but he needed something special to beat Alisson from such a long way out. The shot had power but it is a simple catch for the experienced Brazil keeper. 

Chance - Brazil's first proper chance, and it almost scores from it. Estevao does well to snatch the ball and weave his way through the Ecuador backline and send the ball to Richalison inside the box. The initial shot is blocked, but the rebound falls to Vinicius Jr, who goes for a shot himself. However, Valle is in a good position to make a crucial save. 

With the first 15 minutes played, it is Ecuador which has been the more attacking team. The Brazil defence has remained composed under pressure but its forwards have not offered much in the attacking third. 

Brazil's Gerson and Ecuador's Angulo are both down after a nasty clash of bodies. Both tried to get to the loose ball, which resulted in the clash. However, it does not look serious and they should both be able to continue after some medical attention. 

Angulo makes a dangerous run inside the Brazil box from the left and tries to find a teammate with a cutback but his pass is intercepted and the ball is cleared to safety. 

The game has a good attacking tempo in these early minutes. A positive approach from the home team Ecuador, which is showing that it is not afraid to take the game to the mighty Brazilians. 

ICYMI - Ecuador has had a late replacement between the nets. Valle replaces Galindez who had some issue during the pre-match warmup. 

Minda delivers a good cross inside the Brazil penalty area from a freekick, but the away team does well to deal with the pressure and clear the ball to safety. 

An ironic fact to note - Brazil, known for its iconic yellow coloured jersey, is actually playing in blue, being the away team. Home team Ecuador, meanwhile, sports a bright yellow-coloured jersey. They would surely like some of that Samba flair against the country known for introducing Joga Bonito in the footballing world. 

Early pressure from Brazil, as Richarlison goes for the press in the Ecuador half. However, the home team keeps its composure and soaks the pressure. 

The FIFA World Cup 2026 CONEMBOL qualifier between Ecuador and Brazil is underway at the Banco Pichincha Monumental Stadium.

A new era for the Selecao as Carlo Ancelotti takes charge of his first match as Brazil manager. 

​​

Ancelotti, who Real Madrid to several titles with Vinicius Jr. as a player, said that his unique ability to unsettle opposing defences made him a vital asset.

Casemiro returns to the Brazil squad after not playing in national colours for about a year. He was the captain of the Selecao in the 2022 World Cup, but was not favoured by former coach Dorival Jr. 

However, new head coach Carlo Ancelotti, who has managed Casemiro during his time in Real Madrid, still feels he has a lot to give in national colours. 

In terms of absentees for Brazil, apart for Neymar, Raphinha is a big miss as the forward is out injured. 

Brazil is set to play Ecuador in a FIFA World Cup 2026 CONMEBOL qualifier at the Banco Pichincha Monumental Stadium on Thursday (Friday, according to IST). 

Ecuador: Valle (GK); Ordonez, Pacho, Hincapie(C); Franco, Caicedo, Vite, Estupinan; Yeboah, Angulo, Minda

Brazil: Alisson(GK); Sandro, Ribeiro, Marquinhos(C), Vanderson; Gerson, Casemiro, Guimaraes; Vinicius Jr, Richarlison; Estevao

Ecuador will host Brazil in a FIFA World Cup 2026 CONMEBOL qualifier at the Banco Pichincha Monumental Stadium on Thursday (Friday according to IST).

Ecuador has been in good form in the World Cup 2026 qualifiers, winning seven out of the 14 matches it has played so far. Currently, it sits second in the table with 23 points from 14 games.

Brazil, on the other hand, has not had the best of campaigns till now going by its lofty standards. It has lost five matches till now and sits fourth in the table with 21 points.

However, the five-time World Cup champion ushers in a new era with Carlo Ancelotti at the helm, with the Italian preparing himself to take charge of his first match as Brazil manager.

The Europa League winners have finally put their Australian head coach out of his misery - but who's the best man to replace him?

Ange Postecoglou has officially been relieved of his duties at Tottenham. That's a sentence most Spurs fans had been praying on for months as results and performances took a turn for the worse during a shambolic 2024-25 campaign.

However, victory over Manchester United in the Europa League final added some shades of grey to the situation, with Postecoglou having delivered on his promise to secure some silverware while earning a spot in next season's Champions League to boot. That that achievement came against the backdrop of a 17th-placed Premier League finish, though, has led to his time in north London being ended.

The Australian coach earned plenty of admirers for his attack-minded style of play in his first year at Spurs as he guided the team to a respectable fifth-placed finish in the league, but the drop-off over the past 12 months has, in the eyes of many, been unforgivable, and chairman Daniel Levy had little choice but to make a change.

In the end, Postecoglou's refusal to budge from his principles led to his downfall (along with a series of bizarre exchanges with supporters and the media). The question now is, who is the standout candidate for the job? GOAL ranks the main contenders below...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

 Jannik Sinner is on the brink of reaching his first Roland Garros final after taking a two-set semi-final lead against Novak Djokovic. The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings leads Djokovic 6-4, 7-5, having so far brought his red-hot form to the pair's clash at the clay-court major. 

 Sinner dominated the early baseline exchanges to pile the pressure on Djokovic on Court Philippe-Chatrier, where the top seed dropped just three points on serve in the first set. Djokovic had gone 45 consecutive return games without breaking against Sinner until the Italian served for the second set. But despite snapping that streak to level at 5-5, Sinner quickly bounced back to win the final two games and move within a set of his third consecutive major final. 

 Djokovic's chances of mounting a comeback may depend on how the 38-year-old holds up physically. He began showing signs of a potential upper leg issue in the second set and received a medical timeout ahead of the third set.

 Sinner and Djokovic, who are tied at 4-4 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, are facing off at a Grand Slam for the first time since the 2024 Australian Open semi-finals. Sinner has won four of the pair's past five meetings, and he began Friday's encounter with a 17-1 record for the 2025 season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. 
 Despite the status and form of his opponent, Djokovic will hope to use his greater Roland Garros experience to engineer a turnaround on Court Philippe-Chatrier. The 38-year-old Serbian is a three-time champion at the clay major, and he is chasing a record-extending 25th Grand Slam men's singles title overall. 
 Whoever prevails in Friday night's semi-final will take on defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in Sunday's title match. Alcaraz earlier advanced when Lorenzo Musetti retired from the pair's last-four clash with the Spaniard leading 4-6, 7-6(3), 6-0, 2-0. 

 In his first tour-level meeting with Djokovic on clay since 2021, Sinner earned the first break of serve in the match in the fifth game with some typically razor-sharp returning. Although Djokovic later avoided dropping serve again by saving two break points for a gutsy hold at 2-4, he was unable to maintain any momentum in return games. 
 Djokovic frequently turned to his drop shot to try and disrupt Sinner's rhythm on his groundstrokes, but the plan proved far less effective for the Serbian than it had in his quarter-final triumph over Alexander Zverev. 
 Three-time champion Djokovic continued to compete well into the second set and he prevailed in a thrilling 26-shot cat-and-mouse rally in the second game, after which he gave beaming smile as the crowd roared. Sinner was not perturbed, however, and despite his failure to serve out for the set at the first time of asking at 5-4, he made no mistake the second time around to seal his fifth consecutive set against Djokovic.

Although Djokovic later avoided dropping serve again by saving two break points for a gutsy hold at 2-4, he was unable to maintain any momentum in return games. 

 Djokovic frequently turned to his drop shot to try and disrupt Sinner's rhythm on his groundstrokes, but the plan proved far less effective for the Serbian than it had in his quarter-final triumph over Alexander Zverev. 

 Three-time champion Djokovic continued to compete well into the second set and he prevailed in a thrilling 26-shot cat-and-mouse rally in the second game, after which he gave beaming smile as the crowd roared. Sinner was not perturbed, however, and despite his failure to serve out for the set at the first time of asking at 5-4, he made no mistake the second time around to seal his fifth consecutive set against Djokovic.

Lorenzo Musetti's dream run at Roland Garros came to an end on Friday when he was forced to retire against defending champion Carlos Alcaraz due to an upper left leg injury.

Yet the 23-year-old Italian stands by his decision and, speaking after the semi-final clash, Musetti addressed the issue.

“I'm really sad and disappointed how it ended, but still a great match,” said Musetti. “I felt at the beginning of the third when I was serving, I started losing a little bit of strength on the left leg behind, and definitely was going worse and worse, so I decided to stop.

“I think it was the right decision to make, even if it was not what I wanted. Tomorrow I will do exams, and I will of course see and evaluate the situation.”

Musetti came out firing in his bid to reach his first Grand Slam final and took it to the defending champion across two tightly contested opening sets. But he was unable to continue, with Alcaraz leading 4-6, 7-6(3), 6-0, 2-0 when the Italian retired.
Having now lost each of the past three meetings with Alcaraz, all of which have come on clay this year, Musetti now trails 1-6 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. He is, however, able to draw on these matches to better understand where his game is compared to the No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings.
“I think we both started really, really well, hitting the ball really well. Of course I had to play probably my best level of the tournament to stay there with him,” Musetti said. “I felt today honestly I stepped forward on my level. I felt closer to his level.
“I maintained the high level that we showed for two hours or whatever. So [I'm] really, really happy about that. That's a step forward because the last two matches were a little bit one way. I felt that today I had my chances to even try to go two sets up, but of course Carlos, he's playing really well. He's in really great shape. He deserves to go to the final.”

Despite the bitter nature of his exit in Paris, Musetti can look back on a remarkable campaign on European clay. He became just the fifth player in history to reach the semi-finals at all clay ATP Masters 1000 events and Roland Garros in one season. Musetti departs Paris with a 19-4 record on clay this year, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.
Reflecting on his clash with Alcaraz, Musetti acknowledged the nature of the occasion.
“I knew even before stepping on court that I had to play probably the best match of my career so far,” said Musetti. “For part of it, I was doing a great job and I was there physically, technically, mentally. I think I was playing right. Sometimes he wanted to be really aggressive, especially on the return side, and I served really good today.
“At the end if I have to analyse those two sets, they were really, really great sets. Of course the third one and the last two games, there was of course no chance to play at his level with this problem. So it was an unlucky situation, but I think in the end he probably had more than me.”
Musetti, who will leave the French capital up one spot to a career-high No. 6 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, is able to look ahead with confidence approaching the grass-court swing. He tallied a Tour-leading 12 wins on the surface last year with runs to the semi-finals at Wimbledon and the championship match at Queen's Club.

Tall, talented and unapologetically passionate, Stefanos Tsitsipas has become one of the most intriguing figures in modern tennis. With a fearless game and an even bolder personality, he's carved a path unlike any other on the ATP Tour.

The Greek star rose from junior prodigy to Grand Slam contender in just a few seasons, drawing attention not only for his shot-making flair but also for his philosophical musings and on-court fire. 

His performances have electrified crowds and sometimes sparked controversy. Beyond the tennis courts, his story is layered: family ties to tennis and a social media presence that's as unpredictable as his one-handed backhand.

Born on August 12, 1998, in Athens, Greece, Stefanos Tsitsipas is currently 26 years old. He turned professional in 2016 and quickly ascended the ATP rankings, becoming one of the most prominent figures in men's tennis.

Standing at 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 meters), Stefanos Tsitsipas combines his height with agility, making him a formidable opponent. His stature contributes to a powerful serve and an expansive reach, enhancing his all-court game.

Stefanos Tsitsipas and Spanish tennis star Paula Badosa have become one of the most followed couples on the professional tennis circuit. Their relationship began publicly in June 2023, when they posted a series of affectionate photos.

But the road hasn't been completely smooth. In May 2024, the couple reportedly separated, citing the demands of their respective careers and the constant travel that kept them apart. This sparked a wave of speculation and concern from fans.

Yet just weeks later, they were spotted together again in Monte Carlo, and both confirmed their reconciliation during press conferences. He referred to it as “a learning curve” and described her as someone who understands him deeply.

Born into a family immersed in tennis, Stefanos had no shortage of inspiration. His mother, Julia Apostoli, is a former WTA professional who represented the Soviet Union and later Greece. She reached a career-high singles ranking of No. 194 and played at Wimbledon, instilling discipline and love for the sport early on in his life.

His father, Apostolos Tsitsipas, is a Greek tennis coach who studied sports science at the University of Athens and took the lead in developing his game from childhood. He is the oldest of four siblings. His brother, Petros Tsitsipas, is also a tennis player, though primarily focused on doubles.

The Tsitsipas family often travels together, and their tight-knit bond has always been visible on tour. Despite the eventual coaching separation between father and son, the family remains close. Stefanos has often credited his parents for shaping not only his athletic skills but also his mindset and values.

For years, Apostolos Tsitsipas—Stefanos' father—was a constant figure in his coaching box, guiding him through juniors to the professional spotlight. However, as he matured, so did his need for tactical independence.

In early 2025, he made the tough and emotional decision to part ways with his father as coach, stating in interviews that he wanted “a father, not a coach” at that point in his career.

In a strategic move, he brought in Goran Ivanisevic, the former Wimbledon champion and ex-coach of Novak Djokovic, to help refine his game. Ivanisevic's arrival signaled a clear ambition to return to Grand Slam contention with fresh insights and elite experience.

Since joining forces, he has already shown improved consistency and mental resilience, which was evident in his 2025 title run in Dubai. The change also relieved some of the personal pressures that came with a family-coach dynamic.

Djokovic is chasing more tennis history at Roland Garros but World No 1 Sinner stands in his way 

Novak Djokovic faces World No 1 Jannik Sinner in the French Open semi-finals and for a spot in Sunday's title match against defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.

Djokovic, 38, is bidding to become the oldest male grand slam champion in the Open era and said there is “no bigger occasion” for him that taking on the World No 1 in a major semi-final at Roland Garros. 

The 24-time grand slam winner proved he can still compete with the best after outclassing third seed Alexander Zverev in the quarter-finals but Sinner, the reigning US Open and Australian Open champion, has beaten Djokovic in their last three meetings. 

Earlier, Alcaraz fought back after dropping the first set to Lorenzo Musetti to book his place in the final for a second successive year. The Spaniard had taken a crucial second-set tie-break before Musetti began to struggle physically, with the Italian losing eight straight games before withdrawing early in the fourth set. 

Follow live updates and scores from the French Open below:

Novak Djokovic pushes a forehand to the sideline from the centre of the court. He's starting to twinge in his leg but is giving this a real go. 

The point takes him to 15-30 and he unloads on a second serve to win his first break point of the match. 

Sinner serves to the forehand and Djokovic begins the rally in control. That doesn't last as Sinner forces him across the baseline. Sinner drills one down the line and saves the first break point. 

On the second attempt, Sinner hooks a shot into the net! 

Djokovic breaks Sinner's serve. Game on. 

Sinner strikes first with a superb backhand return of serve but Djokovic responds with a serve-and-volley. 

He needs a second attempt at an overhead smash to get the winner though which shows how quick and responsive Sinner is across the clay. 

An inside out forehand wins him another point before a whipped cross court winner puts him 40-15 up. 

He holds but now must break or else Sinner is taking the second set. 

Djokovic is trying but he's finding it difficult to inflict blows on Jannik Sinner. 

In truth he's just trying to hang in there with the Italian during his opponent's service games. 

He can't live up to it. A hold of serve to 15 puts Sinner on the brink of winning the second set too. 

Once again Novak Djokovic is drawn into a prolonged battle to hold his own serve. 

Slight margins such as the pace of his serve or the placement of a sliced backhand are going either for him or against him. 

Sinner pushes Djokovic so far behind the baseline that he can scoop a drop shot over the net. Djokovic comes flying forward but can't get there in time and the point goes to him. 

It sets up a break point rally which shows the task Djokovic faces. Sinner comes up to the net and plays a drop shot, Djokovic's attempted lob isn't good and Sinner knocks it back. Djokovic replys with a backhand but Sinner is already back to the baseline and fizzes his return over. Djokovic goes wide, Sinner breaks serve. 

Novak Djokovic hasn't had a break point against Jannik Sinner in their last two meetings and hasn't had one in this match either. 

He's 15-30 up in this game but Sinner pings down another venomous serve which Djokovic lofts over the back. 

Sinner then flies through the next two points. Almost without issue and holds. 

Things are tough for Djokovic out there. 

Not this time! A rally of thunderous backhands goes Sinners way after he checks a cross court shot and drills it straight instead. The ball lands on the line and the game goes back to deuce. 

Djokovic looks as though he's giving this game everything he has and forces Sinner long. 

At advantage, he comes up to the net and wins with an overhead volley. 

Great hold from the great man. 

Before this match began it was expected to be a close affair. 

Perhaps the biggest question was how a 38-year-old Novak Djokovic would cope against his younger opponent. 

The answer so far is well, but not well enough. Each player is good enough to take points from the other but the margins are slightly against the Serb. 

At 30-30, on his own serve, he scoops a forehand, barely knee high, into the tape and gifts up a break point opportunity. 

Djokovic then leaps into another forehand in the next rally and forces an error from Sinner to reach deuce. He yells in triumph and gets a reaction from the crowd. 

It may be what he needs. 

Sinner miscues a sliced backhand into the net and advantage goes to Djokovic. 

This match has ramped up in skill. 

Sinner serves out wide to Djokovic's forehand and the Serb sprints back into the middle of the baseline in anticipation for Sinner's hit which lands long. 

Djokovic is upping the pace of his returns, especially from the serves, in the hopes of rushing his opponent. 

The results are inconclusive yet. A backhand goes wide and another error puts Sinner into the lead at 30-15. 

But, a precise forehand drilled quickly down the line putd Djokovic back on level terms and there's a chance to force break points...

... Or is there? Sinner fires down two aggressive serves and goes on to hold. 

Djokovic holds to love, which will be welcome because he was doubling over between points in the last game. 

Djokovic hangs up another lob but Sinner has it covered, Djokovic goes wide. 

WHAT A POINT! Incredible rally! Djokovic goes for the drop shot, but Sinner caught it and made the angled volley! Djokovic sent Sinner chasing, forcing Sinner into another angled volley, but was there at the net! He stands and roars to the crowd. 

Deuce again - another incredible exchange. Djokovic is throwing everything he has at Sinner, but Sinner is replying by sending back so much pace, and he's not missing anything. It's incredible. Djokovic eventually misses. 

Sinner HOLDS with the forehand winner. An epic game, and still no break point for Djokovic. But that was the closest he had been.

In a rematch of last year's Olympic gold-medal final, Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini dismissed Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider to reach their second straight Roland Garros doubles final. They will face Anna Danilina and Aleksandra Krunic for the title on Sunday.

In a rematch of last summer's Olympic gold-medal final, Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini won again and returned to the Roland Garros women's doubles final.

Roland Garros: Draws | Scores

No. 2-seeded Italians Errani and Paolini reached the French Open doubles championship match for the second straight year after dismissing No. 4 seeds Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider 6-0, 6-1 on Friday.

""We did, I think, a perfect match,"" Errani said afterwards. ""Didn't miss many balls today, and we played really good. ... They're for sure one of the best teams on clay right now and in the world. We [prepared] very good, I think.""

Errani and Paolini needed to fight back from a set down to take the gold medal from Andreeva and Shnaider at last year's Paris Olympics -- which was also held at Roland Garros.

This time around, though, Errani and Paolini dominated play from the start, and they needed only 61 minutes to prevail on Court Simonne-Mathieu. The Italians now lead Andreeva/Shnaider 4-1 in the team head-to-head.

A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros)

""We played in the Olympics, we play in Doha, we played in Australia,"" Paolini said. ""Many times. Every time it's tough, you know. It's tough playing with them mentally, also, because they're playing really well.""

In Friday's match, though, Errani and Paolini never faced a break point. By contrast, Andreeva and Shnaider stared down 16 break points in the clash, and dropped serve six times.

The Italians will now try to go one better in Paris than they did last year. They fell to Coco Gauff and Katerina Siniakova in last year's Roland Garros women's doubles final.

Despite Errani and Paolini's proficiency on tour as a team over the last year -- they have won four WTA 1000 titles to go along with their gold medal -- they have not yet won a Grand Slam title as a duo.

In fact, Paolini is still seeking her first Grand Slam title in any discipline. Along with her Roland Garros doubles final, Paolini also reached two Slam finals in singles last year, but was unable to convert any of them into a title.

Errani, though, has a Career Grand Slam in women's doubles. The 38-year-old won all four majors alongside Roberta Vinci between 2012 and 2014.

Errani has also won two mixed doubles Slams with another Italian, Andrea Vavassori. The first came at last year's US Open. The second came yesterday, here in Paris.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Errani and Paolini will take on Anna Danilina of Kazakhstan and Aleksandra Krunic of Serbia in Sunday's final. In an all-unseeded semifinal, Danilina and Krunic outlasted Ulrikke Eikeri of Norway and Eri Hozumi of Japan 6-7(5), 6-3, 7-5.

Danilina and Krunic were down early breaks in both the second and third sets, but they battled back each time before prevailing in a 2-hour and 46-minute barnburner on Friday.

At 5-5, 30-30 in the third set, Danilina carved an overhead with so much spin that it left Eikeri chasing down the surprisingly short ball to no avail. Krunic polished off that game with a winning volley to break for 6-5. In the next game, another superb reflex volley by Krunic sent them into the final.

This is Danilina and Krunic's first event as a pairing since 2022. Technically, the team has now reached consecutive finals -- before this tournament, their most recent result together was a runner-up finish at 2022 Cleveland.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Nearly three years later, they picked up where they left off, and posted a huge upset in the quarterfinals by beating No. 1 seeds Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend.

Now Danilina and Krunic are back into another championship match, and it is Krunic's first trip into a Grand Slam final, in any discipline. The 32-year-old Serbian is a former Top 40 player in singles; she has won one WTA singles title (2018 's-Hertogenbosch) and reached the Round of 16 at the 2014 US Open.

Danilina has previous Grand Slam final experience, including a title. The 29-year-old won the 2023 US Open mixed doubles championship with Harri Heliovaara, and she was a women's doubles runner-up at the 2022 Australian Open partnering Beatriz Haddad Maia.

In a rematch of last year's Olympic gold-medal final, Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini dismissed Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider to reach their second straight Roland Garros doubles final. They will face Anna Danilina and Aleksandra Krunic for the title on Sunday.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

 Jannik Sinner is on the brink of reaching his first Roland Garros final after taking a two-set semi-final lead against Novak Djokovic. The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings leads Djokovic 6-4, 7-5, having so far brought his red-hot form to the pair's clash at the clay-court major. 

 Sinner dominated the early baseline exchanges to pile the pressure on Djokovic on Court Philippe-Chatrier, where the top seed dropped just three points on serve in the first set. Djokovic had gone 45 consecutive return games without breaking against Sinner until the Italian served for the second set. But despite snapping that streak to level at 5-5, Sinner quickly bounced back to win the final two games and move within a set of his third consecutive major final. 

 Djokovic's chances of mounting a comeback may depend on how the 38-year-old holds up physically. He began showing signs of a potential upper leg issue in the second set and received a medical timeout ahead of the third set.

 Despite the status and form of his opponent, Djokovic will hope to use his greater Roland Garros experience to engineer a turnaround on Court Philippe-Chatrier.

Billy Heyen

Two of the most well-known players in women's tennis have made a surprising decision.

Naomi Osaka and Jessica Pegula are planning to tune-up for Wimbledon differently than usual.

They were both slated to play at the HSBC Championships, also known as the Queen's Club Championships. But that tournament announced that both players won't be participating this year.

Hoping to see @JPegula & @naomiosaka back on court soon ❤️🤍#HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/9itz6TUAxd

SI's Pat Benson writes, ""The Queen's Club is located in London, England, and is considered to be the primary warmup for Wimbledon. However, there are other grass court tournaments players can jump into to prepare for the third Grand Slam of the season.""

Osaka and Pegula both had disappointing French Open exits.

Osaka went out in the first round to Paula Badosa. Pegula fell in the fourth round to wild card Lois Boisson.

They'll both be looking for better performances at Wimbledon, and they'll be trying a different method of getting prepared than usual. We'll have to wait until early July to see how it all works out for them.

Novak Djokovic looks to stay in the running for a record 25th Grand Slam title with a semifinal battle looming Friday at the 2025 French Open. The match is scheduled to start at 1 p.m. ET (7 p.m. in Paris) with TV coverage on TNT and truTV and streaming on-demand.

Sinner carries the world No. 1 ranking and is on a head-to-head hot streak with Djokovic, having beaten him in four of their past five meetings. Friday's semifinal will be their first meeting of the 2025 season, during which Sinner won his second straight Grand Slam tournament at the Australian Open. The 23-year-old Italian has yet to win the French Open and could make personal history if he beats Djokovic to make his first career final.

French Open semifinal at a glance

Djokovic had to survive a major test in No. 3 Alexander Zverev in the quarterfinal round, winning three straight sets after dropping the opener to surge into the semis. Though the French Open is statistically Djokovic's least successful with three wins in 20 tries, he has won the tournament twice in the past four years. Djokovic had his bid for a second straight Roland Garros title cut short last year when he had to retire due to injury.

The festival's founder, Kevin Lyman, talks about revitalizing the 30-year-old punk rock road show and why $149 is the right price for today's fans.


													By
												

	Dave Brooks



Vans Warped Tour might be one of the best-selling festivals of 2025, but organizers say no one music act is responsible for moving the bulk of the 240,000 tickets sold so far across three U.S. cities. Indeed, the brand name alone seems to have been enough. 


	“We sold the vast majority of those tickets before we had a lineup,” says Kevin Lyman, founder and producer of the traveling punk show, which ran from 1995 to 2018 before returning this year for a limited 30th anniversary run. Lyman, who has partnered with Live Nation festival company Insomniac for this year's Warped, is working from a makeshift office and headquarters after the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year forced him to leave his Altadena home, which was damaged but largely spared from the blaze.  


	“I think there's nostalgia in the market, but it's not just for the music — people are longing for events that are affordable and give them a chance to discover something,” says Lyman. Prices for this year's Warped Tour are $149 for a two-day pass, and the tour is much shorter, with just three stops this year instead of the typical 36 markets. Two of the three markets piggyback off events organized by Insomniac: Warped's Washington, D.C. stop, from June 14-15, comes two weeks after Insomniac's Project Glow EDM fest; while the Orlando stop, Nov. 15-16, takes place one week after EDC Orlando at Camping World Stadium. Warped Tour is also coming to Long Beach, Calif., from July 26-27 at Shoreline Waterfront Park. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Each of the three two-day stops on the tour accounts for nearly 80,000 tickets sold. When combined, the fans attending all six days of the Warped Tour this summer will have purchased 240,000 tickets. That's likely more tickets than were sold at Coachella this year, which took place over two consecutive three-day weekends, sources tell Billboard. It also likely surpasses the number of tickets sold at the three-day Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas. 


Billboard recently caught up with Lyman to discuss the 30th anniversary tour, including how he pitched it to Steven Van Doren, son of Vans founder Paul Van Doren; his expectations from the fans; and whether the 2025 outing is a one-and-done or has the potential to return in 2026 and beyond. 


What made you decide to bring Warped Tour back? 


	People don't miss something until it's taken away. I had a fantastic crew; we did a lot of marketing for bands and helped a lot of younger artists. And then, when we took it away, people realized that there was a place for something like Warped Tour. But by then I was busy doing other things — traveling, teaching my class at USC and working on other projects. And then the pandemic hit, and being on a college campus and being around young people, I could see a new need for Warped Tour arise.  


What kind of reception have you received so far? 


	I think it's been exciting because the bands that remember Warped Tour remember how important it was to their careers, and the younger bands now are super excited to be able to have that experience and be part of it.  


Why did you bring in Insomniac for this year's Warped Tour? 


	There's a lot of people over there that grew up around Warped Tour, attended in the past and even worked on Warped Tour. Maureen Valker-Barlow, who works as a senior vp at Insomniac and landed her first job at Warped Tour, approached me, and it was easy for us to figure out how to work together. And then it was like the green light came on, and we just ran with it. They have great people over there like Amanda Phelan, who is a great booker, and Maureen, who I previously mentioned, handling sponsorship, as well as Chris Barlow and Nathan Armstrong in production. I've always operated as very small and independent, working in a garage, and they're a big company, and they know how to run festivals. They handle a lot of the day-to-day stuff, absorbing a significant part of the logistics. And marketing. They've given me a little bit more of that structure.  What was it like approaching Vans to do another tour?  That was easy, because Steve Van Doren and myself go back — we're talking 25 years of Warped Tour and years before that. It was easy to go over there and say, “Hey, here's the idea, let's bring it back with these people. I have faith in them.”  Sure, there was a lot of paperwork, but it only took ten minutes of conversation to get this thing going. 


Was it difficult to come up with a budget around a $149 ticket price? 


	Not at all, because I knew from the beginning that Warped would only work if we kept the ticket price fair. I feel strongly that a $149, two-day ticket is affordable to our fans. I think 90% of the reason that people are getting turned off by festivals is because they're too expensive. Warped was always the show for people that maybe didn't have that money for some of the other festivals. Both myself and Insomniac felt $149 was the right price, and a lot of people have responded to that price. It also helps that we delivered the lineup. It's an eclectic lineup that touches on our history and past, but it also looks forward to the future. I'm excited to see which of the younger bands we've booked get the biggest reaction from the fans. 


You've got some big names on the lineup this year like Avril Lavigne, Fishbone, Less Than Jake, Dropkick Murphys, Pennywise and Sublime. You've also got dozens of baby bands and newcomers scheduled to play. How do you strike the right balance between old and new? 


	Well, it's partially an economic exercise. Every band you book, no matter how big, makes up part of your ticket price, and you always have a few that are reliable and a few that are more of a gamble. We're booking some of these bands in January, wondering how big they will be in August? Are they going to be bigger than what we paid them? Can the $5,000 band generate $25,000 in value from fans who are excited to see them? If you look at our social media right now, we really don't need to push Sublime or Rise Against. They're already known. People are going to enjoy them, and they're going to have a big, big crowd. We want to grab onto those younger acts like LØLØ or Honey Revenge and really boost them on our social media so they have a big audience at Warped Tour. A lot of what we focus on is leveraging the Warped brand and the larger bands to help raise the profile of the smaller acts. 


Did you get the idea to list the bands on the lineup poster in alphabetical order from Insomniac? 


	No, that's something I started doing in 1996 because I hate arguing over billing. I think we waste so much time arguing over font size on the poster when we should be marketing to fans and getting behind the show. People are smart. People will come and find the bands they want to see. If you could put Korn in the bottom corner of a festival lineup, people would find them and be excited about them.  


What about scheduling? How do you keep egos in check with the schedule? 


	We don't announce the set times until the day of the show. I do that because I want people to come early and enjoy all the young bands. I go to too many festivals where people come in at sunset and miss all the great young bands. And my thing is, Warped fans are diehard music fans. They're not fashion fans, they're there for the music. And they're going to figure out the lineup. And I think everything we're doing so far is working. Hopefully, we deliver the show that people will want to come see next year. 


So Warped is not a one-and-done? This is a multi-year project? 


	I want to really go see what the first show is like in D.C. before we make any final decisions on that. I want to go see the audience and who's coming. Is it people that want to be part of something moving forward, or people trying to capture a memory? My guess is that it will be a blend of both, but we'll see. 


Could it return as a true touring property, going from city to city, buses and all? 


	No. Definitely not. I can't do that to myself, hitting the road for two months straight. I've had seven different surgeries because of the Warped Tour. I don't need any more.

			By Anthony D'Alessandro, Justin Kroll 


EXCLUSIVE: Talks for who'll wind up with the much-prized Texas Chainsaw Massacre IP are beginning Monday as anywhere from five to eight studios and/or streamers are vying for the rights of the Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel created property which canvases film, TV, live events and games. 


	We first told about this beauty contest, administered by Verve; the agency having repped the rights to the slasher franchise since 2017. Exurbia Films is the primary production company behind Texas Chainsaw Massacre with Pat Cassidy, Ian Henkel and Kim Henkel as producers. The property is repped by attorney Marios Rush. 

	











	There are no clear frontrunners, however, new creative parties have emerged with a passion for the project. Myriad notable creative entities have teamed up with studios to pitch Verve and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre rights holders on their vision for notorious killer Leatherface, who uses his chainsaw to go on a cannibalistic killing spree. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Since we first told you about the project, Taylor Sheridan's name has gained steam as having interest in the property. At this point in time, Sheridan would only serve as a producer on a future Texas Chainsaw Massacre project. No surprise that he's interested as Sheridan was raised in Texas. 


	In regards to the Oz Perkins' version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, we understand the Longlegs filmmaker would only produce and co-write with Bryan Bertino. Bertino, who directed the original 2008 The Strangers, would helm this particular version of Leatherface, should NEON win rights. 

	











	Jordan Peele's Monkeypaw is another new party to emerge with an eye on Texas Chainsaw Massacre, also in producing capacity. Monkeypaw has a production deal at Universal.  


	We first reported that Strange Darling‘s J.T. Mollner and A Minecraft Movie and Weapons producer Roy Lee were kicking the tires. We understand that's a TV a pitch aligned with A24, and will have Austin, TX native Glen Powell involved, but not starring. 


	Separately, Lee has a feature film pitch for Texas Chainsaw Massacre which would be set up at Netflix. 


	The original 1974 movie was made for $140K and distributed Bryanston Distributing Company, famed for its theatrical release of 1972 X-rated title Deep Throat. Texas Chainsaw Massacre would go on to make $31M with the filmmakers getting stiffed on profits. In 1983, New Line Cinema acquired distribution rights with the entire franchise via nine movies grossing north of $252M worldwide There also comics, a novel and two video game adaptations. 


	New Line launched a prolific 2003 remake directed by German filmmaker Marcus Nispel with Michael Bay producing and pre-Quiet Place Andrew Form and Brad Fuller executive producing. Starring Jessica Biel just as she was segueing from 7th Heaven to feature films, that title remains the highest-grossing in the 51-year old franchise at $107M.


	Classic horror franchises, rebooted after several years laid dormant, are a big a business, especially when left in the hands of passionate auteurs, i.e. Scream VI under the direction of Radio Silence opened to a series best at the domestic box office with $44.4M (and $108M domestic), ditto for 2018's Halloween which saw the return of Jamie Lee Curtis under the direction of David Gordon Green; that pic opening to a franchise high of $76.2M (and ending its domestic at $159.3M). Recently, Final Destination: Bloodlines, the first sequel in 14 years in the New Line 25-year old series, opened to a franchise high of $51.6M and quickly became the highest installment in a six film series with a current running global take of $235M.

			By Denise Petski, Dessi Gomez 


UPDATED, June 6: The body swap shenanigans will continue at a whole new level in Freakier Friday, previewed in the film's newest trailer.


	Lindsey Lohan's Anna Coleman has many wedding preparations to undergo, and her mom Tess (Jamie Lee Curtis) is there to help. Unfortunately, Anna's daughter (Julia Butters) and Anna's husband-to-be Eric's (Manny Jacinto) daughter do not get along, as evidenced in Anna's daughter writing her mock vows and calling Lily Davies “a little demon thing with an obnoxious accent.”


	Flash forward from a fortune teller (Vanessa Bayer) incident on Anna's bachelorette where Bayer assesses that Butters' and Sophia Hammons' step sisters to be “are called to be family” and tells Anna and Tess that they may learn another lesson from “walking in each other's paths,” the lightning that does strike them twice puts them all in a quartet body swap situation.

	











	“Change the hearts you know are wrong,” Bayer's voice says. “To reach the place where you belong.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Chaos ensues as the four realize that Anna and her daughter have swapped bodies while Tess, aka grandma, and Lily have swapped bodies.

	Lily as Jamie Lee Curtis says “we can break our parents up for good,” and the original duo set out to do just that and “reunite her (Anna) with her first love” who is Chad Michael Murray's Jake.


Previous, March 14: They're back. Twenty-two years after the premiere of Freaky Friday, Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan have reunited as mother-daughter, reprising their roles as Tess and Anna Coleman, respectively, in the sequel Freakier Friday.












	The story picks up years after Tess (Curtis) and Anna (Lohan) endured an identity crisis. Anna now has a daughter of her own and a soon-to-be stepdaughter. As they navigate the myriad challenges that come when two families merge, Tess and Anna discover that lightning might indeed strike twice.


RELATED: Lindsay Lohan & Jamie Lee Curtis Back Together Again In ‘Freakier Friday' First Footage – CinemaCon


	Check out the first trailer below.


	In it, a fortune teller (Vanessa Bayer) reads Tess and Anna's palms and marvels at the fact that their life lines have intertwined in the past, while the mother-daughter duo tries to downplay that incident. She warns them that the lesson they learned might come into play once more.


	Set to Chappel Roan's “HOT TO GO!” the ground shakes and Tess and Anna find themselves going through a chaotic body swap all over again, but this time with two more people involved. And of course Chad Michael Murray, returning to reprise his role of Jake, rolls up on a motor cycle in the end of the clip to make a “grand, sexy entrance.” No sign of Manny Jacinto, who will play Lindsay Lohan's character's husband, or Never Have I Ever breakout Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, but eagle-eyed fans have spotted Elaine Hendrix, one of Lohan's costars from The Parent Trap (1998) in a brief scene.

	The film also stars Julia Butters, Sophia Hammons, Rosalind Chao, Vanessa Bayer, and Mark Harmon.


	Nisha Ganatra directs, based on the book Freaky Friday by Mary Rodgers. Pic is produced by Kristin Burr, p.g.a., Andrew Gunn, p.g.a., and Jamie Lee Curtis, with Nathan Kelly, Ann Marie Sanderlin, and Lindsay Lohan serving as executive producers.


	The film hits theaters on August 8.

Fans of “Summer House” have plenty to talk about when it comes to Paige DeSorbo's personal life and her career. Rumors continue to swirl about her connection to Joe D'Amelio, especially now that DeSorbo has officially announced her exit from “Summer House” after seven seasons. Here's everything we know.

A post shared by B the Prosecco Princess  🥂 (@bravoandcocktails)

Following her late 2024 breakup with “Southern Charm” star Craig Conover, Paige DeSorbo insists she is currently single. However, her fans and Bravo gossip accounts aren't so sure. Clues continue to surface suggesting that DeSorbo is dating businessman Joe D'Amelio.

Sightings of the pair date back to January, when a fan submitted a photo to “Bravo and Cocktails” showing them together at a Philadelphia Eagles game. In February, they were allegedly spotted holding hands at the Super Bowl in New Orleans.

Celebrity gossip outlet Deux Moi posted an image that reportedly shows the two walking hand-in-hand during Super Bowl weekend. “Steph With Da Deets” also highlighted that the mystery man with DeSorbo wore the same watch and shoes as D'Amelio and that his tattoos match those seen in other photos.

Meanwhile, “Xoxo Bravo Girl” shared a post of flowers that appeared in DeSorbo's Instagram story—with what looked like part of D'Amelio's tattooed arm also visible. The fan account commented, “If these flowers were from her parents or a friend she would've said so, I'm sure.”

DeSorbo recently told People, “I'm definitely not jumping into anything serious right now. I want to focus on my career, and I want to do things when I want to do them, with who I want to do them with, so I'm just enjoying my time.” Still, the Super Bowl photos suggest something might be blooming. Deux Moi reported that DeSorbo was “spotted getting cozy with her rumored friend,” while Enty Lawyer teased that a certain reality star (believed to be DeSorbo) was trying to quietly manage a new relationship.

Fans have also noticed her purse in a selfie posted by D'Amelio, as well as what appear to be matching hotel room photos shared by both.

A post shared by Bravo (@bravotv)

While speculation about her love life continues, DeSorbo just confirmed a major career move—she is leaving “Summer House.” The announcement came the morning after part two of the season 9 reunion aired.

“I have a little life update for you: I've made the decision not to return to ‘Summer House,'” DeSorbo shared via Instagram Stories on June 5. “Being part of this show has been one of the most rewarding chapters of my life—the friendships, the drama, the giggles. All unforgettable.”

DeSorbo joined the Bravo series in season 3, which debuted in 2019. “You've seen me grow up over these last seven summers,” she reflected. “I'll always be grateful for the memories, the community, and the opportunities this wild ride has brought me.”

The 32-year-old added, “But like all good things (and some bad decisions), it's time for this chapter to close.” She also promised fans: “You haven't seen the last of me, I promise. So much more to do together, but for now you know you can always find me and Daphne in my bed.”

As for rumors that DeSorbo might join “The Real Housewives of New York City,” she recently told Glamour, “Housewives is such an established franchise, I think it would be very hard for me to assimilate. I would never say never, but it's not something I'm working toward.”

Sources told “Bravo and Cocktails” that her decision to leave “Summer House” may be related to her desire to keep her single life more private. “My thought is she doesn't want her single love life played out on camera,” one source shared.

Talking to Ridley Scott feels a bit like it must have been to watch gladiator matches in the Roman Colosseum: You never quite know what to expect, but it's guaranteed to be an exciting ride.

He's been knighted, nominated for four Oscars, and his films have grossed more than $5 billion worldwide. Even if he wasn't 87 years old and 30 films into an almost 50-year career, Scott has earned the right to talk about what he likes. On a recent Sunday morning, the subject was his 2005 film “Kingdom of Heaven,” which now receives a limited re-release in theaters and a spanking-new 4K transfer on home video. 

 










Starring Orlando Bloom, Eva Green, Jeremy Irons, David Thewlis, Brendan Gleeson, and Edward Norton, the original “Kingdom of Heaven” grossed $218 million worldwide up against a $130 million budget and mixed reviews. At the time an underwhelming period follow-up from the man who previously directed Best Picture winner “Gladiator,” its director's-cut version has earned a reputation as one of Scott's best films. Yet 20 years later, he's as eager to digress from his intended path as to luxuriate in a well-earned victory lap.

Speaking recently to IndieWire, Ridley Scott looked back at “Kingdom of Heaven” and its unconventional approach to exploring the twin histories of Christianity and Islam in a post-9/11 cinematic landscape. In addition to comparing it to the red-meat satisfaction of “Gladiator,” Scott recalled the process of casting Edward Norton as leprosy-stricken King Balthazar without giving him credit, discussed the inspirations of David Lean and John Ford's “The Searchers,” and revealed the one script in his war chest of unrealized projects that he's still desperate to make.

This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

IndieWire: As the man who popularized director's cuts with “Blade Runner,” where does this film rank for you in terms of Hollywood's mistreatment of your work?

Ridley Scott: You could write a book about that, dude — and that would be Chapter One only. The problem is it is a constant aggressive dance between commerce against art, and each side has the right to have an opinion. If somebody's giving me a million dollars to fuck around and make my movie, he has a right to have some opinion. If somebody's giving me $200 million, he has every right to have a fucking opinion. If I was on that side, I would want to know everything. So in a way, you both get in each other's way. 

 










But I never made a movie until I was 40 — I was experienced in advertising. I'd done Steve Jobs' first commercial. but I'd probably done 2,000 or 3,000 commercials as a filmmaker and operator, and I was very, very successful where we had offices in Paris, London, New York, and L.A. So when I moved to Hollywood, I ain't a learner. I'm not a kid. I'm walking in with “The Duellists,” which won [best debut film] at Cannes. They [didn't] know what to do with it, so they made seven prints for America. My first film is “Duellists,” my second film is “Alien,” third one is “Blade Runner,” the fourth film is “Legend.” And at the end of all that, because none of them quite worked except for “Alien,” one of them said, “Have you ever thought making a film about normal people?” I thought, maybe they're right. So then there was a very little, really great film called “Someone to Watch Over Me.”

You had been intrigued by the Crusades for a really long time, but “Kingdom of Heaven” feels heavily filtered through a more secular, contemporary perspective. How intentional was that as you and William Monahan began to put this together?

Bill's writing is so persuasive that I didn't fully recognize, even though 9/11 had just happened, what thin ice we were walking on. Also, Bill's coming at it from a reverse point of view that the infidel[s] — us — are the assholes, and we are invading a place where we shouldn't even be. Doesn't that echo many cases today? We're not going to go there, but it fucking does. On top of that, the King of Morocco asked to see me, and so I go to his court, he sits down, has a cigarette, and we chat. He said, “This script is beautiful. It has such respect for my faith and my culture. I will help you and protect you.” That was the beginning, and I'd just had one of the best experiences I've ever had in Morocco. I've [now] done five things in Morocco. Frankly, I nearly always had a good time because I feel comfortable with the culture.

 










Was this film always meant to be a slightly more subdued or slower-burn kind of story than something soapier and more conventionally crowd-pleasing like “Gladiator”?

Listen, crowd-pleasing is a billion dollars, dude. So believe me, I'm very happy if I please the crowd. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that, because we are in the business of entertainment. If not, you shouldn't be doing it.

Of course, but was this something where that different perspective was going to demand an approach that wasn't as flashy as “Gladiator” was?

Well, I don't think “Gladiator” was flashy to start with, but I think I understood what the Roman universe would be like. I'm good at getting into the smell of the time. And all I can do is look at reference [materials] and try and imagine what it was like. In Rome, they still celebrate “Gladiator” by running the Coliseum once a year. So the Italians quite like it. And then “Kingdom of Heaven” was the most popular film in Egypt, and I think it's partly because when the film was put out 20 years ago, it seems to be about religion and the conflict of that. I think a certain kind of audience will simply not go and sit because they're not interested. So my feeling is that because of the platform [of home video], “Kingdom of Heaven” is there all the time, every night globally and people got to sit and go, “Wow, that's good.” And so off that, Fox now has had a very, very good 20 year run with it. And that's why they came back and said, “I want to put it out in 500 theaters in 4K. Are you up for it?” I said, “Of course.” Now, I've had many journalists who say they're experts, and they said, “But this was not like that… and that was not like that.” And my question to them was, “Were you there?” And they said, “No.” So I said, “Well, shut the fuck up. Go fuck yourself. Go write a book.”

 










There's this incredible silent weapon in this film with Edward Norton as the masked King Baldwin. Was he always meant to be uncredited?

He didn't want to. I said, “Ed, are you sure you want to do this?” He said, “Yes, I don't give a fuck. I want to be in the movie.” He said, “And don't credit me because I'm not there. It's only my voice. But [as an actor,] I want to experience the film.” And that was it.

And I got lucky because I met [Ghassan Massoud,] who was really a very strong Muslim actor who played Saladin so well and so sympathetically — fundamentally based on actual history. Saladin died, not exactly a pauper, but a poor man because he began life as a soldier, a general, a warrior, a philanthropist, a rich man. Then when he insisted people had to leave Jerusalem, and without [violence], his fervent guys with behind him said, “There has to be blood.” He said, “No, there has to be tax.” They settled for the tax to leave. Saladin paid for it, and it bankrupted him.

Restored in the director's cut, the inclusion of Sibylla's son was a big point of contention in the conception of this film. Were there other details that you faced hurdles in trying to include?

Bill wrote a character I can only describe within his Muslim faith as a fundamentalist who was constantly contradicting Saladin. There's great scenes where [this character] said, “Why haven't you done this? You should have done that.” And then Saladin would come back; he gives an answer which cuts his balls off. Every faith has fundamentalism, so we included those extremities, and the guy who played the extremist was fucking great as well.

 










Bill wrote the script, and now and then I was helpful. With [King Baldwin,] I used to live in a house from 1360. Does that say much? I had a fucking moat. It was lit with candles — nuts, right? I love feeling like I'm living in the past. And as Sibylla's brother, he got leprosy at 15, and he functioned till he died at 23, 24, and had to wear a mask because he was so disfigured. He had to be lifted in the saddle to appear to be fine because he was supporting his position as the King of Jerusalem. In the recorded history, it was purported that Sibylla's child had passed at about 13 or 14. It also suggested that the child may have had leprosy, and therefore, she could not bear to see her child go through what her brother would go through with an incurable disease. So we enlarged on that. [Eva Green] never forgave me for cutting that 17 minutes. Her mother shouted at me. “How can you do this?” I said, “I know, I'm sorry!”

I read a quote that said that “Lawrence of Arabia” is a constant point of inspiration for you as a filmmaker. When you're making a film like this, do you have a moment where you're like, “I don't mind stealing that shot of Peter O'Toole atop a sand dune?” Or, say, borrow a classic “Searchers” shot — those classic film tropes — when you're coming up with shots?
 










Yeah, the best shot in “The Searchers” is the doorway in silhouette, and [John Wayne] fucking steps outside. When I was 11 years old, I saw that and said, “I want to do a Western.” I mean, “The Searchers,” in many respects, you don't have war parties in that part of the world. They're Navajo, so it was all wrong. But it's majestic and marvelous, right? I just cannot criticize it. And not only that, it jumped onto the first idea that many women who had experienced life with a tribe never wanted to come back. Not because of what might be smuttily thought of as a thing, but the fact that their way of life was more attractive. So [John Ford] even dared to do that with Natalie Wood. Then they tried to correct it because John Wayne wants to shoot her.

But David Lean, I have great admiration for everything he did. One day I actually had lunch with him. I was making “Legend” with a 21-year-old Tom Cruise in Pinewood. I've got my massive forest on the Bond stage, and David walked in saying, “Who the is this madman building this fucking forest?” So he said, “You want to have lunch?” So I had lunch with David Lean. And he was great, very elegant man. Smoked a lot. And at two o'clock, he said, “I think you should get back.” I said, “Absolutely,” and I sort of saluted him and left.

 










Not just with this release, but in the 20 years since it was released, do you feel like “Kingdom of Heaven” has truly been vindicated?

If a film educates at all, it was worth it. People sit and watch this who'd never normally watch it, so thank you for streaming — otherwise, it would be lying on a fucking shelf in some vault somewhere for 20 years. “The Duellists” runs every night on Netflix. That's 50 years old! So thank God when people say, “What the fuck is that?” and click. And they go, and they're engaged. And in “The Duellists” you'll learn a little bit about Napoleon, right? You know, but I loved doing “Matchstick Men,” which is comically funny. But I try and change my venue constantly — I like being on thin ice.

Looking at your filmography, there are dozens of projects that came and went. “Tripoli” was the film that led to “Kingdom of Heaven.” Is there one among those unrealized projects that you haven't been able to do that still kind of haunts you?

Well, those, I own them. There's always a time that they can be done. I own a Western, which is the best Western I've read, which was written 1980 by a very good writer who passed away in COVID. We [contacted] his estate and said, “Can I buy the script?” So I own it. And if you're going to do a Western, for me, it can't be about towns and saloons and batwing doors and reeling lines with a whip — you know, cow catching and shit like that. I mean, that's not my kind of Western. It has to be about the Indigenous people and the trappers or the men who wander through the plains from minus 40 degrees to 110 and live their life having to evolve around the Indigenous people. So it's that, and it's so fundamental. It's absolutely great.

 










Is that a Cormac McCarthy adaptation, or something else?

No, I did one thing with Cormac McCarthy, which I think is one of my best films, but it's too dark. It's called “The Counselor.” If you are a writer, I think it might appeal because the dialogue of Cormac is phenomenal, and I fell in love with it. You know we made that film for $32 million with that cast? It speaks for Cormac. I read it and went, “Whoa!” And I started making phone calls, and I had everyone cast by noon.

Thank you so much for your time. Can you tell me the name of that Western that you wanted to make?

No.

The director's cut of “Kingdom of Heaven” is now available on 4K Blu-ray.

Summer doesn't technically start until June 20 this year, but already its season of new movies is in full swing. Earlier this week, journalists caught the first IMAX preview screening of Joseph Kosinski's racing drama “F1” — starring Brad Pitt, who does his own driving, and in theaters from Warner Bros. June 27 before streaming later on Apple TV+.

The purported $300-million movie also stars “Snowfall” breakout Damson Idris as Pitt's rookie prodigy, plus Javier Bardem, Kerry Condon, Tobias Menzies, and Shea Whigham. “Screen Talk” podcast co-host Anne Thompson caught the early screening, praising the film‘s technical specs and Pitt's intense gaze from behind the steering wheel, as he balances a dramatic performance with actual race-car driving.

Co-host Ryan Lattanzio finally caught up with Celine Song's “Past Lives” follow-up “Materialists,” out from A24 June 13. Mixed early word-of-mouth out of New York City set an uncertain tone for the movie going in, but he says Song delivers an entertaining and shrewdly written rom-dram in the spirit of the greats of its genre from the late-'90s through the early aughts. Dakota Johnson stars as a disaffected matchmaker who's disarmed by a suave private equity broker played by Pedro Pascal. Meanwhile, she's reconnected with her ex-boyfriend, a middling New York theater actor and cater-waiter played by Chris Evans in one of his most compelling performances.

 










Anne argues that “Materialists” — far less fizzy than its marketing would have you believe, including a subplot involving Johnson's desperately single client played by “Succession” star Zoë Winters — doesn't satisfy as a romance. Ryan is more taken by the film, which at times fascinatingly feels like an ethnographic study of how a romantic comedy or drama moves, operates, and behaves. Anne doesn't think the chemistry between Johnson and Pascal sparks enough, while Ryan argues that's the point, as you'll see in the film. Where Anne and Ryan really disagree is in the commercial potential of “Materialists”; Anne sees the film as a box-office, audience-pleasing play, while Ryan attests that the film is darker, more cynical, and even at times weirder than the more conventionally minded movie it may appear to be on its surface.

In this week's episode, we also take a look at the ongoing Tribeca Festival in New York City, where Ryan has already seen a few standout titles on the ground. Plus, we debate whether exhibitors and theater owners should be allowed to join The Academy, as recently posited by Clayton Davis in a Variety piece. Anne explains why that shouldn't happen. It's a long road to creating another branch anyway, as The Academy has only just made way for stunt and casting kudos.

The most beautiful and dangerous thing about parent-child relationships is that they're always changing, even as the love that holds them in place never does. 

It's beautiful, of course, that newly widowed horse mom Kate (Julianne Moore) would still do anything for her precious Claire (Sydney Sweeney, raw enough to plow through some very goofy dialogue), even though the once-adoring little girl has matured into a shrieky, manipulative drug addict who now sees her mom as a hindrance to scoring heroin. The danger there, as we see over the course of Michael Pearce's luridly enjoyable “Echo Valley,” is that doing “anything” for her full-grown junkie daughter requires a very different kind of commitment from Kate than it did when Claire was a kid. Back in the day it probably just meant buying her a pony for their farm. Now it means dumping her boyfriend's dead body in the nearest lake so that Claire won't go to jail for “accidentally” bashing his brains in with a rock. The contract is the same, but the terms have grown a bit more complicated.

Scripted by “Mare of Easttown” writer Brad Ingelsby, and soaked in a similar fear of white suburban rot, this protean Apple TV+ thriller works best when it operates by the same principle. The first half of the film seems to shift into a different genre every few minutes; what starts as a chilly grief drama about a depressed New Jersey lesbian who can't pay her farm bills — to the great annoyance of her rich landowner ex-husband, played by a fiery Kyle MacLachlan in a one-scene cameo that feels like an unresolved parenthetical — sours into a Cassavetes-loud heartwrencher when Claire shows up at her mother's door in desperate need of help. 

 










But that vibe — and the domestic violence that comes with it — lasts just long enough to set up a very different sort of movie. You see, Claire thought it would be funny to throw her “fuckface” boyfriend's stuff off a local bridge, but she failed to realize that $10,000 of his dealer's heroin was bundled up inside of it. Womp womp. Now the couple has to come up with the money themselves, or Jackie is going to kill them both (he's played by a scummy as hell Domhnall Gleeson, who predictably delights in a role that allows him to subvert the inherent kindness of his demeanor). And as if that weren't bad enough, the stakes get raised even higher when Claire returns to the horse farm a few days later covered in her boyfriend's blood and crying for her mommy.

Not only will Kate do anything to help, but — suddenly endowed with the sort of preternatural confidence that some parents are able to muster from the worst of their panic — she also seems to know exactly how to do it. Moore has always displayed a rare gift for revealing her characters' inner strength by allowing us to watch them unravel (see: the pharmacy scene in “Magnolia”), and she conveys so much about the ineffable weight of motherhood through Kate's wounded but unflinching reaction to the crisis that Claire lays at her feet. No joke: There was a brief stretch of this story where I thought it might turn out that Kate used to kill people for a living, but “retired assassin forced back into the game” is one of the few sub-genres that “Echo Valley” doesn't entertain.

 










“It must be fucking awful having a kid like that,” Jackie snarls to her at one point. “Always having to clean up their shit.” But a sociopath like him could never understand that “having to clean up someone's shit” can be the most affirming obligation this world has to offer, even if that shit is a lot messier than any parent would ever want for their child. 

That's why “Echo Valley” is at its richest and most self-possessed during the fleeting moments when it seems like dumping a body at the bottom of a lake might be the magic bullet that brings these two women back together again. The unconditionality of Kate's love for her daughter is put to the test, and — grim as the circumstances of that test might be — there's something inescapably tender about how Kate passes it with flying colors. In the absence of her late wife, and the unfortunate proximity of her sniveling ex-husband, Kate can't help but exalt in the purity of the affection she'll always have for Claire. 

Alas, Pearce (“Beast,” “Encounter”) does better with ambivalent threats than he does with emotional openness, and Ingelsby's script is too eager to shift into yet another different gear for “Echo Valley” to kindle any lasting warmth from its mother-daughter murder duo. Opting to embrace an increasingly soapy and sordid crime saga at the exact moment when it should be growing closer to its characters, the movie fatally diverts its attention from the unconditional love between them. At first it seems as if the story is pivoting to focus on the imbalance of that relationship, but Claire soon disappears from the picture entirely, leaving Kate to clean up the mess with Jackie by herself. 

 










There's some fun to be had in watching “Echo Valley” shift into a battle of wits between Moore and Gleeson, as both actors mine devious nuance from the thin gruel of a paperback thriller (though I was just as amused by the movie's growing reliance on Apple software, and by whatever corporate machinations led to Verizon getting a shoutout instead of AT&T). But “Echo Valley” loses its reason for being as soon as its self-impressed third act decides to focus on Kate's resourcefulness at the expense of her emotional responsibility. 

This movie can get away with murder so long as it's about a mother turning into a master criminal because her daughter is in danger — a perfect summer riff on the concept of a parent who finds the strength to lift a car when it rolls over their child. It's only when Kate becomes the subject of Jackie's ire that “Echo Valley” blunders away the source of its power. Without that unconditional love to hold it together, this movie's volatile changes can't help but obscure the essence of a story about what it really means for some things to always stay the same. 

“Echo Valley” is now playing in select theaters. It will be available to stream on Apple TV+ starting Friday, June 13.

Darren Aronofsky is supporting the documentation of the Israel-Palestine conflict: The auteur produces award-winning feature “Holding Liat,” directed by Brandon Kramer. “Holding Liat” tells the story of Liat Beinin-Atzili, an Israeli-American woman who was taken hostage by Hamas alongside her husband Aviv on October 7, 2023. Liat and Aviv have been held captive in Gaza with 250 other people, 12 of whom, like Liat, are American citizens.

The film details how Liat's parents, sister, and children had to navigate the American political landscape to try to get her released. The official synopsis reads: “Caught between international diplomacy and a rapidly escalating war, their family must face their own uncertainty and conflicting perspectives in the pursuit of Liat and Aviv's release. This agonizing process, and the ultimate fate of their loved ones, challenges how the members of the family understand themselves and their place in the conflict.Through the intimate lens of a family's experience, ‘Holding Liat' poses complex questions of identity across generations, as the family is thrust into the epicenter of a global conflict rapidly unfolding in real-time.”

“Holding Liat” is an independent production of Aronofsky's Protozoa and Meridian Hill Pictures. The film was a Berlinale documentary award winner and will make its North American premiere at Tribeca 2025. Liat and her family will attend Tribeca screenings and answer audiences questions during the festival.

Director Kramer is actually related to Liat, and knew he had to tell her story onscreen. “This film represents the greatest challenge of my career: it's a deeply personal chronicle of my extended family's intimate experiences, set against the larger Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which continues to impact so many people's lives,” Kramer told IndieWire. “Our team carefully considered the film's rollout, which kicked off with sold-out screenings at the Berlinale – where it was recognized with the Documentary Film Award – and subsequent international premieres in Hong Kong, Brazil, Croatia, Poland, and Israel.” Kramer continued, “As American filmmakers, with a film largely shot in the U.S., the North American premiere is a significant opportunity to reach audiences who are yearning for humane and nuanced storytelling, especially around the complex issues explored in the film. After premiering our last film ‘The First Step' at Tribeca in 2021, it's an honor to return this year with ‘Holding Liat.' We are deeply grateful to Tribeca and our subsequent hometown premiere at DC/DOX for bringing this story to American audiences in a moment that feels more urgent than ever.” 

In a director's statement, Kramer cited how the international conflict is still sadly enduring. “More than a year after October 7, lives are still imperiled: with hostages still held, tens of thousands of Palestinians killed, and people across the region suffering,” he said. “Our conversations about all these issues have only become more polarized, even within communities and families. By telling an intimate story of one directly impacted family, and the way they navigated differences amongst each other, we hope to open up new possibilities for understanding this conflict, and contribute to an end to the unrelenting violence in the region. We are keenly aware that this film is just one family's story out of countless others, and that many important stories may tragically never be told. We hope through the family's resilience and openness, alongside other Israeli and Palestinian films that seek to broaden understanding, audiences will find room to ask deeper questions that help mark a path toward healing and reconciliation.” 

“Holding Liat” is produced by Aronofsky, Justin A. Gonçalves, Lance Kramer, Ari Handel, and Yoni Brook. Aronofsky also has his “Underland” nature documentary, directed by Robert Petit, at Tribeca. 

 










“Holding Liat” will have its North American premiere at Tribeca 2025 as a sales title. Check out a sneak peek below.

6.8

Genre:

Rap

Label:

Mass Appeal

Reviewed:

June 6, 2025

Kiss the Ring was a triumphant moment for Rome Streetz, the culmination of a long-simmering underground career filled with razor-edged street raps and furrowed-brow beats. It was Rome's Griselda debut, extending a hot streak for the prestige label that kicked into high gear with Westside Gunn's 2020 magnum opus, Pray for Paris. Gunn tapped the perfect team of gritty-but-trippy producers for Rome's nasal, piston-firing delivery, and Rome seemed to dip his pen in acid. There's an argument that Kiss the Ring was the apotheosis of the Griselda sound, the last moment before the dam broke and flooded DSPs with half-hearted boom-bap revival drums and vaguely hard-nosed coke raps. Rome has struggled to fully separate himself from the glut; subsequent records, like 2023's Noise Kandy 5 and Hatton Garden Holdup, his 2024 linkup with founding Griselda producer Daringer, feel like walking in circles—Rome's in constant motion, but headed nowhere. Trainspotting, his new collaboration with Conductor Williams, is a solid, mostly successful attempt at a reset. Conductor produced nearly half of Kiss the Ring, and the album builds upon their excellent chemistry. It's an enjoyable and sometimes entrancing listen, even if it falls a little short of their previous magic.

Rome's main strength is his capacity to make acrobatic rapping sound easy. He's a masterful technician in perpetual motion, churning out stanzas that fill every space of a beat with mesmeric precision. He can take somewhat pedestrian rhyme schemes and break them into syllabic math problems, creating tension that leads to startling payoffs. The lines, “I've been shittin' on every cheap rinky-dink rendition/Do somethin' different, you'll probably get a listen/I'm in Louis linen, lit in Lisbon, livin',” on the second verse of “Connie's Revenge,” don't exactly push the bounds of slant rhyme, but he moves around the downbeat like a deft boxer, landing the end of each phrase when you least expect it. It's thrilling to hear him nail a particularly daring bar structure and never break a sweat.

The problem is that Rome's writing doesn't always match up to his technical prowess. He seems more interested in maintaining a mythos than in pushing his pen to new heights—the punchlines aren't really zingers, and the boasts of microphone or sexual prowess come off a bit first-thought best-thought. His stories feel authentic to him, but distant to the listener; it's the feeling you get when you stare at a word long enough to forget its meaning. Conductor's trippy, off-kilter style suits his sneering delivery well, but it's disappointing to hear a rapper with such commanding presence issue boilerplate rhymes like, “You sold your soul to the pied piper/Shit I touch turn to gold, I'm a prime-time rhyme writer,” over production this weird. Overall, these songs sound great, but you could control-x any of Rome's verses, paste them on any beat from the Griselda extended universe, and not really notice.

Trainspotting's biggest accomplishment is in providing the best star-making moment for Conductor Williams yet. The Kansas City producer's profile has skyrocketed over the past few years; he's gone from an obscure Instagram discovery to earning placements on Drake and J. Cole records, though he keeps a foot in the underground, supplying beats for known quantities like Your Old Droog and billy woods and slept-on talents like Stik Figa and Jabee. He flexes some of his finest work yet on Trainspotting, stripping all superfluous elements from his signature warped-tape psychedelia to craft a sinister, spellbinding soundscape.

These tracks are full of chiming mandolins (“Ricky Bobby”), distorted guitar (“Andre Agassi”), and ghostly choral voices (“Runny Nose”), all caked with a layer of grime. “99 Attributes” is Conductor Williams' sparest contribution, a simple, RZA-esque one-chord loop that becomes more hypnotic with each repetition. His drums often feel muffled, as if they're being played under a weighted blanket in another room, but his skillful EQing retains their resounding thump. He's at his best when crafting adventurous arrangements, like on “Died 1000 Times,” which switches between a sparse, achingly tense chorus and an airy, synth-driven verse where he drops out the snare to give Rome even more breathing room. On “Electric Slide,” he teases a drum pattern that doesn't drop for a full minute and a half, creating a nail-biting sense of anticipation. It's masterful instrumental work from one of the game's most vital producers, but it's a shame that the project can't quite live up to the promise of its talents.

Billy Joel reveals that he twice attempted suicide — sparked by his affair with a band mate's wife — in his new HBO documentary And So It Goes, and that one of the attempts left him in a coma.


	Before he was “The Piano Man,” a twentysomething Joel played in a Long Island hard rock band called Attila alongside his then-best friend Jon Small. At one point, Joel moved in with Small, his wife Elizabeth Weber, and their young son, during which Joel and Weber spent “a lot of time together” and a “slow build” romance developed. Joel eventually admitted to Small, “I'm in love with your wife.” 


	“I felt very, very guilty about it. They had a child. I felt like a homewrecker,” Joel said in the documentary, according to People. “I was just in love with a woman, and I got punched in the nose, which I deserved. Jon was very upset. I was very upset.”


	The affair resulted in Attila's breakup, the (temporary) end of his best friendship, and Joel getting evicted from Small's house. “I had no place to live. I was sleeping in laundromats and I was depressed, I think to the point of almost being psychotic,” Joel added. “So I figured, ‘That's it. I don't want to live anymore.' I was just in a lot of pain, and it was sort of like, ‘Why hang out? Tomorrow is going to be just like today is and today sucks.' So, I just thought I'd end it all.”

	Joel's sister Judy, then a medical assistant, had previously prescribed her brother sleeping pills to help him sleep; Joel's first suicide attempt came when he “decided that he was going to take them all.”

	











	“He was in a coma for days and days and days,” Judy says in the documentary. “I went to go see him in the hospital, and he was lying there white as a sheet. I thought that I'd killed him.”


	Joel, disappointed that his attempt failed, woke up in the hospital and swore to do it “right” the second time. He said he drank an entire bottle of the cleaning product “lemon Pledge,” after which his ex-best friend, Small, took him to the hospital. “Even though our friendship was blowing up, Jon saved my life,” Joel said.


	Small added in the documentary, “He never really said anything to me, the only practical answer I can give as to why Billy took it so hard was because he loved me that much and that it killed him to hurt me that much. Eventually I forgave him.”


	Following that attempt, Joel entered himself into an observation ward for a few weeks, a decision that changed the trajectory of his life. “I got out of the observation ward, and I thought to myself, you can utilize all those emotions to channel that stuff into music,” Joel said.

	A postscript to the affair: Joel and Weber eventually reunited, and the pair wedded. The marriage lasted from 1973 to 1982.


And So It Goes premiered Wednesday at the Tribeca Film Festival, with Joel unable to attend the screening due to his recent brain disorder diagnosis. The singer, however, did send a message via the filmmakers: “Getting old sucks, but it's preferable to getting cremated.”

	In a new interview with Rolling Stone, Eric Church says he was once roped into a Taylor Swift copyright lawsuit after the superstar mentioned his song during a deposition.


	Back in 2017, Swift was sued by the songwriters behind 3LW's “Playas Gon' Play” for using the lyrics “players gonna play, haters gonna hate” in her hit “Shake It Off.” The lawsuit sparked a years-long legal battle that was ultimately voluntarily dismissed in late 2022. But during her deposition months earlier, Swift claimed she first knew of the lyric from Church's song “The Outsiders.”


	“In her deposition, when [talking about the line] ‘players gonna play, haters gonna hate,' she says, ‘The first time I heard that phrase was in Eric Church's song ‘The Outsiders,”” Church said in the Rolling Stone Interview. “She was saying she never heard it on the [original song], which is what they were suing her for. And two weeks later, I got served by the people that were suing her!”


	Specifically, Swift had said she had “heard the phrases ‘players gonna play' and ‘haters gonna hate' uttered countless times to express the idea that one should shrug off negativity,” and had referred to the Church track.

	











	“I sent her a text, and she responded,” Church recounted. “I was like, ‘Hey, thanks. Next time, let's just skip that part?' And she sent me a text: ‘I'm sorry. It's the truth, though. That's when I first heard that phrase.'”


	He added, about his own case: “It's since been settled. But I was like, ‘How did this even happen?'”

	











	Swift and the two songwriters who accused her of copyright infringement on “Shake It Off” agreed to dismiss the lawsuit a month before it was set to head to trial in December 2022. The filings did not include any reason for the agreement to dismiss the case, but it started in 2017 after Sean Hall and Nathan Butleer sued Swift in 2017 for allegedly taking the line from “Playas Gon' Play.”

Church, meanwhile, is currently performing around Nashville during CMA Fest. On Thursday, he made a surprise appearance at Spotify House, performing hits like “Springsteen” and supporting his latest album, Evangeline vs. the Machine.

An international team of physicists has developed a new methodology to aid NASA and other government agencies in their ongoing investigations into unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). The result is a novel strategy integrating a specially designed artificial intelligence program that was partially inspired by the physicists' own hunt for elusive dark matter.

More popularly known as unidentified flying objects or UFOs, UAPs aren't necessarily considered as outlandish as they were decades ago. Setting aside the various theories that point to mysterious visitors from another planet, analysis increasingly centers on determining more worldly explanations. UAPs are often explained by classified experimental aircraft, astronomical events, or simply a case of mistaken drone identity. Meanwhile, a small percentage of sightings continue to baffle experts.

Over the last few years, the US government has attempted to present a more transparent approach to its UAP research, while the military continues a campaign to destigmatize reporting sightings among its ranks. In November 2024, Congress held a publicly televised joint subcommittee hearing about UAPs featuring a former US Navy rear admiral and NASA administrator. While not without its fair share of criticism, these and similar events are shifting the overarching narrative around unidentified aerial phenomenon.

Researchers like Matthew Syzdagis at the University of Albany have followed this evolving discourse for years. An associate professor of physics focused on dark matter, Syzdagis recently began collaborating with over 30 colleagues around the world to determine if this approach to hunting dark matter could be adapted to the search for UAPs. Their results, published this month in the journal Progress in Aerospace Studies, offer a new interdisciplinary methodology to review the past and future UAP sightings.

“As this process moves forward, it's critical that future study of UAPs follows a rigorous, repeatable method that can be tested and confirmed by other researchers,” Syzdagis said in a statement. “We aim to establish a roadmap for these efforts with this paper.”

The team relied on an array of datasets and tools to build their framework, including publicly available Doppler weather information from the National Weather Service (NWS). The NWS data was used to corroborate observations from additional equipment and determine if any of them simultaneously recorded a given anomaly. They then utilized Cosmic Watch, a radiation-detection system, to assess if a target UAP observed by infrared cameras was accompanied by ionizing radiation.

To help analyze the infrared data, Szydagis created a new software program called Custom Target Analysis Protocol (C-TAP) that utilizes machine learning alongside human verification to review individual camera frames on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Inspired by similar strategies used to scan for direct evidence of dark matter, C-TAP then flags and separates actual UAP observations from any digital noise. Finally, these results were overlaid with trigonometric calculations to exclude any known objects in the sky like satellites or the International Space Station.

To test it all out, Szydagis and colleagues used their new methodology to review observable light and infrared images collected on a 2021 field expedition around Laguna Beach, California, amid a period of heightened UAP reports. In total, the team reviewed about one hour of triggered visible and night-vision video footage along with over 600 hours of infrared data and 55 hours of background radiation measurements. Of the multiple anomalies initially flagged, researchers were able to offer plausible and likely explanations for all sightings except for one—a collection of bright white dots inside a dark spot recorded across multiple videos. And even then, it seems unlikely that the UAP event was unique.

“At this point, none can be classified as true anomalies, although further study of remaining ambiguities may alter this conclusion,” the study's authors wrote in their conclusion.

Moving forward, the team hopes their methodology will help more researchers around the world continue to vet UAP sightings on a scientific, unbiased basis. 

“Given the longstanding, global nature of the UAP/UFO question, [and] the air safety and security implications of their presence… studying and understanding these phenomena is of great and urgent importance,” added University of Albany physics professor and study lead author Kevin Knuth.

‘The more I can run around on spaceships, the better.'

by  Samantha Nelson

USA/Syfy's Resident Alien started as a quirky mashup of Northern Exposure and Invader Zim, a fish-out-of-water comedy where Harry Vanderspeigle (Alan Tudyk of Firefly, Rogue One, and Andor), the new doctor in the small town of Patience, Colorado, is actually an alien who wants to take over Earth. Harry's secret was originally only known to Max Hawthorne (Judah Prehn) — a kid with the rare genetic ability to see through alien disguises, who devotes himself to trying to stop Harry's plans — and health-clinic worker Asta Twelvetrees (Sara Tomko), who teaches Harry the value of humanity.

Though the series' protagonist is an alien, the show's science fiction elements were relatively subtle in the early seasons. Harry spends as much time investigating the murder of the town's last doctor as he does trying to fix his ship and get his mission back on track. The locals write off his weirdness because they're dealing with their own challenges: Asta confronting her abusive ex, her best friend D'arcy Bloom (Alice Wetterlund) dealing with opioid addiction, Max's parents Ben (Levi Fiehler) and Kate (Meredith Garretson) winding up on opposites sides of a debate about bringing a fancy ski resort to Patience.

“I think it was a nice way to be introduced to the sci-fi world for people who don't normally like [the genre],” Tomko told Polygon in a video interview.

But as the series went on, more characters wound up uncovering the show's secrets. Deputy Sheriff Liv Baker (Elizabeth Bowen) began looking for unconventional explanations for the odd crimes Patience experienced. Ben and Kate were abducted by aliens who stole their baby. Asta shared Harry's true identity with D'arcy so she could stop lying about it. Even skeptical Sheriff Mike Thompson (Corey Reynolds) had a close encounter with an extraterrestrial. The science fiction elements are fully on display in season 4, which premieres on June 6.

“What I love about our show is there's Harry's world, which is the world of aliens, and there's people in town who haven't know about that, and you care about them because the writing is so strong that everyone is really well developed,” Garretson told Polygon in a video interview. “What's cool about season 4 is that more and more of Harry's world is bleeding into the town, so I think it's an opportunity for the characters to become even more three-dimensional. When are people going to find out what's going on, and then how do they handle that?”

D'arcy was quick to embrace the chance to help Harry, who is now focused on saving humanity from other aliens. She's gone on several dangerous missions, including sneaking into the home of a human-alien hybrid and infiltrating a gray alien base on the moon, where she rescued the Hawthornes' daughter. This season, she even travels back in time with Harry to recover alien technology. Wetterlund, who's also the co-host of the “Treks and the City” Star Trek: The Next Generation podcast, is very enthusiastic about the way Resident Alien has evolved.

“I think that science fiction is a perfect slate on which to examine the human experience, because it removes the historical context that humanity is in and puts it in this imagined world,” she told Polygon in a video interview. “How would these humans in a small town deal with the exploding of their worldview? That is exciting for me. I've always wanted to be part of a sci-fi project like this. The more I can run around on spaceships, the better.”

Reynolds said he grew up watching the Aliens franchise and RoboCop, and he's excited about the chance to get more involved in Resident Alien's science fiction elements.

“I'm proudly a nerd, so this fits my wheelhouse perfectly,” he told Polygon.

Acknowledging the existence of aliens has fundamentally shifted the dynamics in Patience's sheriff's office, where Mike has often been dismissive of Liv's ideas. Now they're working together to uncover a dangerous conspiracy and help an alien tracking cyborg played by Lost's Peter Bach.

“I think we've really stepped into the realm of them being partners, and out of the shadow of the subordinate aspect of things,” Reynolds said. “Mike understands Liv was right. You don't earn any more credibility in Mike's world faster than being right. She was right the whole time. That dynamic fused with what they've been through personally has created a bond that is everything.”

Scenes involving alien spaceships and time portals cost a lot more than ones set in Patience's bar or city hall, and showrunner Chris Sheridan has had to get creative as the show's science fiction elements have expanded — especially since the series had its budget significantly cut going into season 4. One of the main ways the show is saving time and money is by having the gray aliens remove Harry's ability to transform into his alien form.

“That saves us Alan getting in and out of makeup,” Sheridan told Polygon. “Whenever he walks by a mirror, we see a reflection, and that takes time and money animating him.”

Among all the ideas Sheridan had for hiding the budget cuts, that one stuck with him because it fit so well with the show's themes and plot, where Harry has slowly gained more emotional awareness and attachments as he's come to appreciate humans.

“What if he's in this place where he's just human for a while?” Sheridan asked. “What does that do to the character? There's a challenge every year to try to mix things up and add something new, so we were looking to bring out something new in Harry.”

Resident Alien season 4 premieres on Syfy and USA at 11 p.m. ET on Friday, June 6. Episodes will be available to stream on Peacock one week later.

Dan Da Dan returns for an even more satisfying spectacle of supernatural and occult shenanigans as Jiji experiences a monstrous metamorphosis.

There's an exciting, electric feeling whenever a series concludes a near-flawless freshman season that can quickly turn to dread when the prospect of topping that next year is considered. Dan Da Dan was far and away 2024's pop culture juggernaut, thanks to its effortless mix of horror, science fiction, and coming of age rom-com bliss. There's an inherent challenge to sequels — or second seasons — which is why there are so many properties that start out strong, but ultimately leak quality over time. Dan Da Dan avoids these expected pitfalls and delivers something that must be seen to be believed — just like some urban legend cryptid.

Dan Da Dan: Evil Eye tells a strong story that proves the first season's magic wasn't a fluke and that the next batch of episodes are likely to surpass the previous season's greatest heights, just like how Evil Eye surpasses the other cinematic compilation, Dan Da Dan: First Encounter. Dan Da Dan's first season was so successful that it wouldn't have been difficult for the anime to coast on this energy and deliver more of the same. Thankfully, Evil Eye prides itself on its ability to go for broke. It's the proper heightening of storytelling, stakes, and character relationships that you'd hope for from a show's second season. Evil Eye is everything fans want from Dan Da Dan, while also throwing in a few things that they never knew they needed.

Dan Da Dan: Evil Eye is an odds and ends amalgamation of season one's finale and season two's first three episodes that begins with a sizzle reel of highlights from last season. Evil Eye adopts a curious approach where season one's finale immediately feeds into new material, albeit in a slightly revised manner that's not so clear cut. The two are inexorably intertwined and turned into something original that doesn't cheat its way out of what happened in the finale, but still effectively builds upon it with a more effective and narratively suspenseful presentation of events.



Dan Da Dan: Evil Eye and the anime's second season would be facing an uphill battle under any circumstances after its knockout freshman year. The series finds itself at an especially crucial inflection point as Momo and Okarun's duo becomes a trio with Jiji. Many series fumble as they expand their core cast, yet Jiji becomes Evil Eye‘s secret weapon, both figuratively and literally. Jiji was a recent addition who came in at the end of Dan Da Dan's first season and put a huge wrench in Momo and Okarun's budding prospective romance. 

Jiji was a delight during these introductory episodes, but Evil Eye is really Jiji's time to shine and a proper showcase for the newer character. Jiji may have seemed abrasive to the Momo/Okarun shippers and set up to fail in some respects. However, it's hard not to be a Jiji fan after the burst of affable character development that he experiences here. He's just such a ray of sunshine in human Labrador form. Jiji feels just as important and beloved as Momo and Okarun by the end of Evil Eye, which is no small feat.

Dan Da Dan has showcased a wide range of supernatural disturbances across its first season between aliens, spirits, crab men, and more. This trend continues in Evil Eye with the creepy Kito family, outrageous elderly landlords who are another strong example of terrifying occult creatures who have mundane, normalized attitudes so they feel more like put-upon people instead of folkloric monsters. There's a fascinating energy to the Kito family and the predatory dynamic that they have over Jiji. 

The Kito family tap into an energy that's honestly akin to home invasion horror where innocent characters are desperate to break free, but forced to carry out the sick whims of twisted interlopers. The Kitos' macabre aggression with Jiji often brings Funny Games or even The Texas Chain Saw Massacre's Sawyer family to mind. It's a good fit for Dan Da Dan that effortlessly meshes with the anime's reverence towards iconic horror and sci-fi texts, but it's also a style and subgenre that wasn't explored during season one.



Momo's fight against the Kito family is thrilling and reminiscent of combat that's ripped out of Stephen Chow's Kung Fu Hustle. That being said, the Kito are easily the least interesting of Dan Da Dan's supernatural antagonists to date. They're a perfunctory obstacle and the decision to repeatedly threaten Momo with sexual danger grows progressively weaker and more manipulative each time it's done. There are some great set-pieces around these enemies, but it feels like they really could have been triggered by any occult obstacle. Drama is born out of the Kitos' victory over Okarun and Jiji, which pushes Momo into a difficult situation. However, giving the Kito family greater authority so that they actually defeat Okarun and Jiji might have helped these monsters stand out a little more. 

The Kito may slightly lack impact, but they're merely an aperitif for Evil Eye's main event – the giant Kuragari Serpent Lord –  a Mongolian Death Worm – who definitely doesn't disappoint. This creature was actually teased during the tail end of season one. However, it's a monster that exceeds expectations even without Dan Da Dan neatly connecting these dots. Dan Da Dan has been rich in disturbing creature designs and the Great Serpent Lord indulges in uncomfortable Eldritch imagery that feels appropriate for this unexplainable and all-encompassing invader. The anime continues to effortlessly blend actual folklore and urban legends with gripping action storytelling.



The Great Serpent Lord also emits powerful psychic waves that culminate in what's easily one of Dan Da Dan's most unnerving sequences. There's a reverence to this monstrosity that praises him like some sick God. This threat intensifies as Kuragari — the Evil Eye — battles against the heroic trio. Evil Eye, in many ways, is Dan Da Dan's most dangerous enemy yet and he wields a fatal Medusa-esque power. It's a deeply dark idea that teases a more mature and emotionally intense second season ahead. 

Looking beyond the occult action, Evil Eye is an utterly gorgeous film that's on par with anything from season one. However, there are some particular highlights, such as Momo's fight against the Kito or the heightened spectacle that concludes the movie. Most of these moments involve Momo, yet Okarun is still essential and there's a satisfying sense of growth when it comes to their respective skills. Momo and Okarun's personal friendship and emotional bond evolve just as much as their increasingly confident combat skills.



Dan Da Dan has also quietly made a name for itself with its over-the-top chase sequences, which have practically become one of the anime's signatures. Evil Eye doesn't disappoint in this regard and it features a Jiji-driven destructive pursuit that's destined to become a classic. This story turns to more stylized visuals for its emotional moments, like heightened watercolors that dominate melancholy flashbacks. The film's final fight is especially vibrant and accented by kaleidoscopic neon colors and kinetic images. It's such a beautiful and visually inventive expression from Science Saru that reiterates why Dan Da Dan is currently one of the best in the biz when it comes to creative shonen action. You'll curse your eyes for needing to blink and missing a single frame of mayhem.

There's a satisfying sense of closure that's reached by the end of the three episodes that comprise this movie. This feels like a complete story, albeit one that still ends on a cliffhanger. That being said, Dan Da Dan: Evil Eye is a movie that amounts to far more than merely an extended tease for season two. If nothing else, it's just so much fun to spend time with these characters, watch them gain ground, and become more powerful in this beautifully unique universe. Evil Eye is the must-see anime event of the season, whether it's enjoyed in theaters or in piecemeal when season two begins.



‘Dandadan: Evil Eye' is now playing in select theaters.

Season 2 premieres July 3, 2025 on Netflix.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","There are only 2 industries that are hiring a lot right now","https://www.businessinsider.com/jobs-healthcare-education-restaurants-leisure-hospitality-hiring-2025-6","Fri, 06 Jun 2025 18:27:00 GMT","

Health services and restaurant gigs are in strong demand, while office jobs are not.

May's jobs report out Friday morning showed the US added 139,000 new jobs that month. Adding in March and April's numbers, that means that there are 406,000 more employed workers now than in February.

But over those last three months, gains have been tightly concentrated in two sectors, while the rest of the labor market has been much flatter.

Employment in private education and health services jumped by 252,000 in May from February, with robust growth at hospitals and individual and family services.

Employment in leisure and hospitality rose by 122,000 from February, mainly due to growth in food services and drinking places, which include restaurants and bars.

Together, that means those two sectors account for 92% of the total net job growth from February to May.

Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, told Business Insider there are still job opportunities, especially if you want an in-person job like in healthcare. However, he said there is less demand in white-collar fields.

""Right now, your feelings as a job seeker are going to be largely determined based on the type of work you do or the type of work you're looking for,"" Stahle said.

White-collar changes were mixed: employment in financial activities increased from three months ago, while professional and business services fell. However, the growth in financial activities was small compared to the healthcare sector or leisure and hospitality.

""This report's a really good example of what we've seen as a trend in the last couple of years, which is there are real divides that have emerged in job opportunities for job seekers,"" Stahle said.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man wrongly deported by the Trump administration to a prison in El Salvador, is being brought back to the US to face federal charges that he illegally transported undocumented immigrants within the country.

Abrego Garcia was indicted by a grand jury in Tennessee in May, according to court filings released Friday. In the indictment, the government alleges he was a member of the notorious MS-13 criminal gang.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to lift a court order to reinstate U.S. Department of Education employees the administration had terminated as part of its efforts to dismantle the agency.

Officials for the administration are arguing to the high court that U.S. District Judge Myong Joun in Boston didn't have the authority to require the Education Department to rehire the workers. More than 1,300 employees were affected by the mass layoffs in March.

The staff reduction ""effectuates the Administration's policy of streamlining the Department and eliminating discretionary functions that, in the Administration's view, are better left to the States,"" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the filing.

A federal appeals court had refused on Wednesday to lift the judge's ruling.

In his May 22 preliminary injunction, Joun pointed out that the staff cuts led to the closure of seven out of 12 offices tasked with the enforcement of civil rights, including protecting students from discrimination on the basis of race and disability.

Meanwhile, the entire team that supervises the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, was also eliminated, the judge said. (Around 17 million families apply for college aid each year using the form, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.)

The Education Department cannot be abolished without approval by Congress.

The Trump administration announced its reduction in force on March 11 that would have gutted the agency's staff.

Two days later, 21 states — including Michigan, Nevada and New York — filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for its staff cuts.

After President Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 20 aimed at dismantling the Education Department, more parties sued to save the department, including the American Federation of Teachers.

Former President Jimmy Carter established the current-day U.S. Department of Education in 1979. Since then, the agency has faced other existential threats, with former President Ronald Reagan calling for its end and Trump, during his first term, attempting to merge it with the Labor Department.

Much of the right-wing media ecosystem appeared unsure how to react to the seeming public implosion of the relationship between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk on Thursday and into Friday morning. Outlets and influencers that typically react savagely to criticism of Trump played the spat more or less down the middle. Even much of the criticism of Musk was relatively genteel.

“He's gotta let Trump be Trump,” former Fox News host Eric Bolling said on Steve Bannon's broadcast network, Real America's Voice. “You can be First Bro,” he said of Musk, “but you can't be de facto president.”

Behind the scenes, they tell WIRED, Republican operatives could not help but be entertained at the torrent of messages flooding their group chats. They tended to take Trump's side.

One Trumpworld consultant tells WIRED that the entire episode reminded them of a line in a recent Wall Street Journal report, about how Trump had privately described Musk as “50% genius, 50% boy.”

“After today,” the consultant says, “I think he's just 100% stupid.” (Musk did not immediately reply to a request for comment.)

While Musk had been railing against the Republican budget reconciliation package formally known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act for several days on X, things turned ugly once Trump denounced the billionaire during an Oval Office appearance on Thursday with the German chancellor Friedrich Merz. “Elon and I had a great relationship,” Trump said. “I don't know if we will anymore.” Musk subsequently agreed with an X user who called for the president's impeachment.

Still, some presented the conflict as a positive thing, even while calling for it to end.

“I think the great thing about this is we all see it,” said Fox News host Greg Gutfeld. “Would you take a forceful president and a billionaire publicly feuding in public over an invalid president? … At least I know what is going on, and I can somewhat enjoy it, but I want them to stop. I've had it. I don't want to see my parents fighting.”

By Friday morning, Fox & Friends cohost Brian Kilmeade was hoping for an end to the animosity, suggesting there could be a “big, beautiful truce.”

While many in the broader Trump coalition appeared hesitant to commit to one side or the other, this wasn't true of everyone as Thursday afternoon's bevy of rude posts bled into the night. After Musk posted “@realDonald Trump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,” some MAGA loyalists were shocked. Alex Jones, though—the right-wing talk radio host and conspiracy theorist who called the Sandy Hook school shootings a hoax and was sued for defamation and found liable by default—wrote that Trump “needs to respond asap.”

One of the MAGA-verse's most prominent accounts, Catturd, then went after Jones. “What a POS Alex Jones turned out to be - what a fucking fraud,” he tweeted. (Jones did not immediately reply to a request for comment sent to InfoWars.)

Catturd—whom Musk apparently unfollowed— later shared a blown-out portrait of Trump with the caption “Trump 2028.”

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, released a statement Thursday evening attempting to put the fracas at bay. “This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted. The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again.""

Some stalwart Trump defenders used the occasion to take a victory lap over their perceived enemies on the tech right. Trump adviser Steve Bannon called on Musk to be deported in an interview with The New York Times. “They should initiate a formal investigation of his immigration status, because I am of the strong belief that he is an illegal alien, and he should be deported from the country immediately,” he said. On his War Room podcast, Bannon called for Trump to use a Korean War–era law to “seize” SpaceX before midnight. (Trump did not do so.)

Laura Loomer, a right-wing conspiracy monger and influential voice in Trump's ear, as WIRED detailed in a story about her role in national security personnel matters, referred back to a tweet of hers from December 25, 2024: “Don't worry guys. The Big Tech divorce is coming soon. It's now a scandal.”

Loomer later addressed Musk directly, asking him to “please tweet something nice about President Trump tonight.” For good measure, Loomer followed up with a tweet proclaiming “The President of the United States is not a pedophile,” and another predicting that Musk would stand next to Trump when the president signed the package the entrepreneur has described as “a disgusting abomination” into law.

(Trumpworld insiders referring to the 53-year-old Musk as a boy isn't uncommon; as WIRED previously reported, one has called him a preteen child.)

Breitbart—the conservative media site and Trumpworld's favored text outlet—highlighted Trump's threat to cancel Musk's government contracts and stuck with the president's posts on his own social media platform, Truth Social, over embedding tweets from Musk's X. In another story on the site, editor-in-chief Alex Marlow scored what Breitbart billed as an “exclusive” interview with White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields, who went for a cordial tone while defending Trump.

“There's no daylight between this White House and Elon Musk,” Fields told Breitbart. “Elon Musk has his priorities, and this White House and this president have their priorities. We may not be aligned on this issue; but let me tell you this, we're grateful to Elon Musk for the work that he was able to do for this administration.”

Amid all the back and forth, YouGov managed to get a quick online poll of nearly 4,000 people into the field. While many in the conservative media ecosystem hedged their bets, Republican voters were more clearly sorted. They backed Trump over Musk nearly 12 to one.

I'm saying that if you don't want to use a platform because it's ""lock-in,"" but then use SaaS... then the argument doesn't hold true, especially if you consider the ""taxes"" of using SaaS.

Let us buy our software, and separately, offer us a service agreement that actually has to provide value in its own right. The bundling of these in SaaS is what makes this obscene.

  No matter what choice you make, it's always going to be vendor-locked in.
  Switching out something, even if it's open source and self-hosted,
  means that you're rewriting a lot of code.

That's not what lock-in means. Just having a vendor-specific component or integration, is not the same thing as being locked-in to a vendor or integration.Locked-in means that switching it out for something else is either A) impossible, or B) would require an investment greater than just sticking with the existing thing.When you write software in a loosely-coupled, highly-cohesive way, the intersection between different components is designed to not take much work to replace one component or another. The same is true of systems. If the interfaces of those components are simple, and their use is cohesive, it should not be difficult to replace a part. However, if your components are not cohesive, then it will be a huge pain in the ass to replace anything.So, no, it's not a good idea to choose a platform because ""everything is lock-in, so fuck it, i'll lock myself in even more!"" As a developer, I can see the appeal, as it means less work for you. But as a business owner, this is a stupid reason to choose a solution. Choose solutions that will support the business and give it flexibility to change over time.

I agree with you. If you're starting out, if your business is not profitable, don't pick SaaS. Don't take the time and pay those 5 taxes. Rather just use the platform, and if you're scalable and profitable and growing, pick some other technology that supports you in the long run.
