Qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup continues this weekend with a number of UEFA games, including this one on Friday between Norway and Italy. Norway currently leads Group I, putting it in position to qualify directly to the World Cup, though there's a lot of time still left to go. Italy has yet to play a Group I match. Norway opened Group I play with a 5-0 win over Moldova, with Julian Ryerson scoring just five minutes into the match. In its second game, things were closer, but the team still came away with a 4-2 win over Israel. Italy didn't begin its campaign until now, as it was in the UEFA Nations League quarterfinals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inter Miami CF get the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup underway when meeting Egyptian powerhouse Al Ahly on Saturday, June 14 at Hard Rock Stadium. In Group A action, the Herons will also face FC Porto (Portugal) on June 19 at Atlanta United's Mercedes-Benz Stadium before returning to Hard Rock Stadium and encountering Palmeiras (Brazil) on June 23. This summer's expanded Club World Cup features 32 teams from six confederations vying for silverware and portions of the unprecedented $1 billion prize pool. Naturally, the Cairo-based outfit have dominated their domestic league as well. Spanish manager José Riveiro oversees Al Ahly, who recently signed Egyptian international forward Trézéguet. He'll look to link up with compatriot Emam Ashour in the final third. Inter Miami's Club World Cup debut arrives after winning the 2024 Supporters' Shield with a league-record 74 points (2.18 ppg). This offers a fitting stage for their global-minded, ambitious project that sprinted into action in July 2023 when Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba joined the club. Then last year, Luis Suárez arrived to make it a "Core Four" of FC Barcelona legends in South Florida. Can head coach Javier Mascherano's side start strong in Group A? It likely hinges on their balance between defense and Messi's brilliance.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was the summer of 2019, and Agyemang was about to enter his second season at tiny Eastern Connecticut State University, a 30-minute drive from his hometown of East Hartford. "Obviously, I had doubts," Agyemang told FOX Sports in a recent phone interview. "I've always had the utmost confidence in myself. Where I'm from, not many people make it in this game." Jump forward five years, and Agyemang is about to come full-circle. With top forwards Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi unavailable because of injury, Agyemang figures to log big minutes in the national team's final tournament before the main event next summer. And there's no reason to think Agyemang won't have one. His stellar two seasons at ECSU got him a transfer to D-I school Rhode Island. This winter, he earned a January camp invitation to the USMNT on the strength of his breakout 2024 MLS season, during which he had 10 goals. He then scored in January exhibitions against Venezuela and Costa Rica, which earned him a roster spot for the Nations League finals in March. Playing alongside first-teamers like Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, Agyemang had the Americans' only goal in a 2-1 loss to Canada in the third-place game. Over what was a disastrous weekend for Mauricio Pochettino's team, the play of Agyemang and Diego Luna — who helped set up Agyemang's strike — was the lone silver lining. "I think the confidence in him has grown," Luna said this week of his fellow USMNT newcomer. [RELATED: Diego Luna's unlikely USMNT path and a possible World Cup spot] "Just to feel like you're able to compete and play with these guys and contribute with a goal — it's a good feeling," Agyemang said. "You look at a forward and you can tell when they're confident; they start taking their chances a little bit better," U.S. defender Walker Zimmerman said following Tuesday's training session in Chicago. "They're more energized to make those extra runs on both sides of the ball. Still, Agyemang has plenty of room to improve. Privately, the Argentine has encouraged him to be cleaner on the ball, though Poch is clearly happy with his progress. He and assistant  Miguel D'Agostino even went to visit with Agyemang and veteran defender Tim Ream at Charlotte's training facility this spring. "First touch, the first movement to get the separation between defenders — those are little things I'm definitely trying to learn," Agyemang said. After almost a year together in Charlotte, Ream has gotten to know Agyemang well off the field, too. USMNT veteran Tim Ream has been a mentor for Patrick Agyemang at MLS side Charlotte FC. A move overseas seems inevitable at some point, before or after the World Cup. Agyemang's parents and two older brothers have yet to see him play for the U.S. in person. They'll get that opportunity just steps away from where Patrick's unlikely journey began. "I've always dreamed of playing in that stadium," said Agyemang, who has asked U.S. Soccer for 25 tickets to Saturday's match. "That it can potentially happen this week is surreal." The same can be said about his journey to this point. "To see where I've come from, even two years ago, to where I am today, that development is crazy," Ageymang added.

The Europa League winners have finally put their Australian head coach out of his misery - but who's the best man to replace him?

Ange Postecoglou has officially been relieved of his duties at Tottenham. That's a sentence most Spurs fans had been praying on for months as results and performances took a turn for the worse during a shambolic 2024-25 campaign.

However, victory over Manchester United in the Europa League final added some shades of grey to the situation, with Postecoglou having delivered on his promise to secure some silverware while earning a spot in next season's Champions League to boot. That that achievement came against the backdrop of a 17th-placed Premier League finish, though, has led to his time in north London being ended.

The Australian coach earned plenty of admirers for his attack-minded style of play in his first year at Spurs as he guided the team to a respectable fifth-placed finish in the league, but the drop-off over the past 12 months has, in the eyes of many, been unforgivable, and chairman Daniel Levy had little choice but to make a change.

In the end, Postecoglou's refusal to budge from his principles led to his downfall (along with a series of bizarre exchanges with supporters and the media). The question now is, who is the standout candidate for the job? GOAL ranks the main contenders below...</p>

Pep Guardiola's side have been drawn into Group G of the competition - alongside Juventus, Al-Ain and Wydad FC - which is set to kick-off next weekend, just three weeks after the Premier League season concluded. And Akanji, who is currently in the US on Switzerland duty for their upcoming pair of friendlies, has candidly spoken out against the fixture congestion. The centre back said: 'I have been a strong critic of this competition for some time now. Coming off their first trophy-less season under Guardiola since 2017, it is unsurprising that City's players are not keen to get right back onto the field after just a few weeks. When asked about City's underwhelming 2024-25 campaign, Akanji offered an optimistic verdict and argued it could have been 'far worse' than it turned out to be. City finished third, earning them a spot in next season's Champions League competition, while they were dispatched in the FA Cup final by Crystal Palace, and knocked out of the EFL Cup and Champions League in the earlier rounds. 'Set against the expectations we have, this hasn't been a good season,' Akanji continued. 'But it is still our worst campaign for some time. However, Pep Guardiola still said he was proud of us for never giving up. The season could have finished far worse than it did.' Teams are expected to take this year's Club World Cup more serious than ever before, considering the mammoth prize pool at stake. The side that takes the trophy home will receive a windfall of $40m (£30m), while a team winning of their games could see them land up to $125m (£92m). City have won the trophy once - back in 2023 - when it was an annual competition.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Osimhen - described as being "world-class" by Jose Mourinho - is yet to agree terms with Al-Hilal, and is also being courted by Galatasaray, where he spent last season on loan. Chelsea and Manchester United have been heavily linked as well, with the Blues attempting to sign Osimhen on deadline day last summer. "I think Chelsea have decided to go in a different direction now," said Mikel, speaking to GIVEMESPORT ahead of the Club World Cup where he's working as a pundit for the tournament's exclusive global broadcaster DAZN. "Liam Delap has now come in, but I have always said if Chelsea signed Osimhen, he'd come in and hit the ground running straight away. I hope this happens with Delap as well, and that his arrival brings the best out of Nicolas Jackson. I want to see a great partnership between both of them, pushing each other in training and on the field. What I really want for Victor, is to see him in the Premier League. I want to see him play for Chelsea, his boyhood club. He grew up with Didier Drogba as his idol. I would love to see him play at Stamford Bridge. And then there's Manchester United or maybe even Arsenal who could be in the market for him. I can tell you, Saudi Arabian clubs have been chasing him for a very long time. They made so many offers in previous windows, and yet he refused to go. "I told him, 'You still have time to play in Saudi one day, so just stay in Europe for now and come to a top club like Chelsea!' And then, maybe after three or four years, go to Saudi. "It's hard to turn down the kind of money on offer there. But of course, if Al-Hilal can convince him, we'll see Victor at the Club World Cup and that will be exciting." DAZN struck a $1 billion deal for the global broadcast rights to all 63 games of the inaugural Club World Cup, which starts on June 14 as Lionel Messi's Inter Miami take on Egyptian champions Al-Ahly at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium. It will be the first game in charge of new Hilal boss Simone Inzaghi and Real coach Xabi Alonso, while Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dean Huijsen could be handed their Real debuts. Chelsea, meanwhile, begin against Los Angeles FC in Atlanta in a match that will see French striker Olivier Giroud come up against his former club, while Manchester City open the tournament against Moroccan side Wydad in Philadelphia. And newly-crowned Champions League winners PSG have the toughest opening fixture of all on paper as they face Atletico Madrid at the Rose Bowl Stadium in California. "When you look at all the fixtures, it's hard not to get excited," said Mikel. "I am over the moon to be involved with DAZN at such a massive tournament. DAZN are making some big moves in football, and the Club World Cup is going to be groundbreaking. "I can't wait to see the PSG-Atletico game. What a job Luis Enrique has done, and Diego Simeone will relish trying to tactically outdo him. And all football fans want to see Lionel Messi on such a big stage. "I am also looking forward to seeing some of the non-European teams, like Al-Ahly, Al-Hilal or Auckland City. I really hope we see a team, perhaps with slightly less of a global profile, that will just surprise everyone and set the tournament on fire. "And of course, there's Chelsea, who I believe can win the competition. And visually, what a trophy it is to get your hands on. Even the World Cup trophy doesn't have that. Every single group-stage win earns clubs $2 million, and winning the tournament is worth $125m, and some of that money might go straight into the transfer window this summer." Chelsea come off the back of beating Real Betis 4-1 in Poland to win the Europa Conference League, and in doing so became the first ever club to win every piece of major domestic European silverware. Yet however Chelsea fare in America, Mikel believes securing Champions League football has already made Enzo Maresca's first season in charge a success. "The season started well for Chelsea and I thought, 'OK, we're right up there! "But then we faded away over the festive period. I actually think that poor run was a much-needed welcome call. "In my day, we knew the festive period was important because you could take a big step towards winning the Premier League. Chelsea's young squad just went off the boil and lost a bit of focus. All credit to them, though, because they recovered and finished in a Champions League spot and won the Europa Conference League. That means there is real confidence and momentum ahead of the Club World Cup." Mikel has been particularly impressed by fellow midfielder Moises Caicedo, who was named Chelsea's Player of the Season after starting all 38 Premier League games this season. Caicedo made 114 tackles, 49 interceptions, 53 clearances, 229 recoveries and won 236 duels. Chelsea have a competitive midfield with Caicedo, Romeo Lavia and Enzo Fernandez competing for spots alongside Cole Palmer. "Peak Mikel in 2012 or 2013 would still get into this Chelsea midfield, despite the obvious quality they have," he said. He's grown into his position and plays with no fear. He's started scoring goals, creating chances and is now one of Chelsea's main guys. And we all know Romeo Lavia when fit is outstanding. But I think there is still room for another box-to-box or ball-carrying midfielder, and Reece James is best as a right back in my opinion." Although Caicedo won Chelsea's Player of the Season, Mikel has also singled out Marc Cucurella. The 26-year-old struggled initially following a £62 million switch from Brighton in August 2022, but has been a near automatic starter following an impressive Euro 2024 last summer as Spain beat England to win the trophy. "There was this whole narrative around Chelsea being 'Cole Palmer FC', and what a signing he's been, but it's Marc Cucurella who has really impressed me this season, both defensively and offensively," said Mikel, who hosts the popular Obi One Podcast. Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson will also be out to prove a point in America, especially now he faces competition from new £30m Chelsea forward Liam Delap. Jackson also came under criticism after being foolishly sent off in May's 2-0 loss at Newcastle for an elbow on Sven Botman. Mikel has previously questioned Jackson's ability as a natural finisher, but still feels the Senegal striker can become a top player for Chelsea. "Nicolas has big potential and I never intended to disrespect him with previous comments," said Mikel, who scored six goals during his own time at Chelsea. He's good on the ball, quick and can run in behind. And he stretches defenders, which gives Cole Palmer more space. Now it's just about finishing more chances, and I actually think the competition with Delap will help him improve further. He needs to score more goals, and hopefully Delap's arrival with cause a positive reaction. Christopher Nkunku should also be a source of goals, but to be honest I think his time at the club is now done. There was a lot of hype about him when he joined from Leipzig. I was so excited when he arrived, but his time at Chelsea hasn't panned out well. It's time to sell Nkunku, get some money and then invest in a wide attacker. I am not so sure replacing Nkunku with another striker is wise because it's not good to have three established strikers all fighting for one position." He also expects Trent Alexander-Arnold to make a statement after joining Real Madrid from Liverpool for €10m, while Erling Haaland is Mikel's pick to claim the golden boot. The Club World Cup promises drama and global match-ups never seen before, and it is likely one of the European heavyweights will end up lifting the trophy for the very first time and in doing so walk away with Champions League-type money earned over just four compelling weeks of football. "Apart from Chelsea, I am actually most excited to see Boca Juniors play, and they have a great game against Bayern Munich in their group. "Manchester City are a bit of an unpredictable team to judge at the moment. Pep Guardiola is trying to put things right after a disappointing season and this is his chance to get a trophy and sort of salvage things. Although an established side, Manchester City could be a bit of an unknown quantity because Kevin De Bruyne will likely have left, Jack Grealish isn't going to be in the squad and a few new faces should come in before their first game [against Wydad]. I know many Liverpool fans will disagree with me, but I just think that now it's time to celebrate him, including what he's achieved at Anfield. Remember, it wasn't only Trent leaving, Liverpool also let his contract run down, and it wasn't an ideal situation. But it's time to move on, and Trent announcing himself as a Real Madrid player at the Club World Cup can help do that. "And then I obviously predict Chelsea to win the whole thing! All these talented young players are starting to gel together as a team, and they have a good manager that knows how to handle and improve them. We are only a couple of players short of being able to really compete for all the top trophies, but I would still like to see a bit more experience added this summer. "I want to see us take the Club World Cup seriously and win it. I want to see Chelsea's best players performing at this tournament because doing so would round off an amazing season. And you simply can't win this tournament without beating some outstanding teams along the way. So, if Chelsea can become the first-ever Club World Cup champions, it would be a huge boost heading into next season, when I think we might start to get back to the Chelsea I remember, that always competed for and won silverware with regularity. And to leave America with a new gold badge on the shirt would be a constant reminder to all these young players every time they put the shirt on, and for four years, that Chelsea is a club for serial winners and nothing less."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UNITED STATES MEN'S National Team head coach formally announced his 26-player roster for the 2025 Gold Cup that will open on June 15 in California. The first is that Sergino Dest was removed from the roster due to fitness issues that were determined during a physical evaluation. He was replaced by John Tolkin, who arrived in camp on Thursday. Meanwhile, Pochettino added Walker Zimmerman, Nathan Harriel, and Paxten Aaronson in place of DeJuan Jones, Sean Zawadzki, and Folarin Balogun. Prior to that, Chris Brady replaced Patrick Schulte. DEFENDERS (9): Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew; 3/0), Alex Freeman (Orlando City; 0/0), Nathan Harriel (Philadelphia Union; 0/0), Mark McKenzie (Toulouse/FRA; 19/0), Tim Ream (Charlotte FC; 68/1), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace/ENG; 24/1), Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati; 32/3), John Tolkin (Holstein Kiel/GER; 4/0), Walker Zimmerman (Nashville SC; 43/3) MIDFIELDERS (9): Brenden Aaronson (Leeds United/ENG; 47/8); Tyler Adams (Bournemouth/ENG; 44/2), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps/CAN; 0/0), Johnny Cardoso (Real Betis/ESP; 18/0), Luca de la Torre (San Diego FC; 24/1), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake; 4/0), Jack McGlynn (Houston Dynamo; 4/1), Quinn Sullivan (Philadelphia Union; 0/0); Malik Tillman (PSV Eindhoven/NED; 17/0) Many familiar faces from recent camps were left off this roster. Some were due to injuries, some were due to the Club World Cup, Christian Pulisic needed a break, and Yunus Musah withdrew due to personal reasons - but many were football decisions. Some of those include Josh Sargent, Joe Scally, Cameron Carter-Vickers, Tanner Tessmann, Aidan Morris, Auston Trusty, Marlon Fossey, Alex Zendejas, and others. Meanwhile, Pochettino has given a big opportunity for others to impress at this Gold Cup. But players like Brian White, Sebastian Berhalter, Max Arfsten, Alex Freeman, Nathian Harriel, and Chris Brady have continued to do well and Pochettino wants to give them a chance. The benefit for having a coach like Pochettino who comes in from the complete outside is that he sees things with fresh eyes. When watching the Gold Cup, the right approach is to look at team as if there are very few locks. Now, it is more open and many of the newcomers over this past year are there not because of reputation but because they are playing well. We will now see if that hunger carries over into the national team. Aside from Chris Richards, who had a very good season for Crystal Palace, the rest of the team's central defenders all have serious questions and there is no clear pecking order. Mark McKenzie had a good season overall in France but stumbled down the stretch. Miles Robinson has been good but unspectacular for FC Cincinnati. Walker Zimmerman now reenters the equation and is among the more consistent players but has only recently returned from a concussion. No one questions that Antonee Robinson is the team's best left back. But who backs up Robinson has been an open question for years. ?Max Arfsten has been called in to compete with the @USMNT at the 2025 Gold Cup where they will take on Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia, and Haiti in the group stage ? Arfsten has been on the team all camp while Tolkin only was added when Dest was forced to withdraw. Both players should get opportunities over the coming month but Arfsten has the value having worked with Pochettino in January and March. Another good camp could put him in the drivers' seat to back up Robinson moving forward. As for Tolkin, he showed well in the Bundesliga but after Holstein Kiel's relegation, he has to shift down to the 2.Bundesliga unless he gets sold (which didn't sound likely based on his media call in May). Dest hasn't played with the national team since March 2024 due to his ACL surgery and recovery. Joe Scally wasn't called up and DeJuan Jones had to withdraw due to an injury when he was replaced by Nathan Harriel – who hasn't even always been the starter for the Union at right back due to the emergency of Frankie Westfield – who is with the U.S. U-20 team. Freeman (who is the son of former NFL great Antonio Freeman) is extremely athletic and fits the profile of a modern fullback. Despite only being in his first season as an Orlando starter, he is now heading into the Gold Cup where he will play a lot of minutes and perhaps even be the team's starter. He on a very accelerated push in his development. It is reminiscent of when DeAndre Yedlin forced his way on the 2014 World Cup team. Like Yedlin, big European suitors could soon follow (but whether he wants to risk losing playing time in a World Cup year is another question). The central midfield of this Gold Cup roster has a lot of interesting names including Sebastian Berhalter, Jack McGlynn, and Luca de la Torre. It's important to note that Weston McKennie and Yunus Musah would be here in normal circumstances, so it remains unclear how many spots are up for grabs (although it doesn't seem like Musah is a lock right now given his second half of the season). That means there is likely at least one opening if they play well this month. Despite being suspended for the final, Berhalter was critical in helping the Caps advance to the CONCACAF Champions Cup final and he is also a big factor in their first place standing. The concern is that he has not been playing at a very high level for a long period of time. He must show that his form the past three months is not a blip. De la Torre has been out of the team for almost a year after dealing with injuries and a lack of playing time at Celta Vigo. He offers a lot to this team in that he brings experience, quality, and the benefit of not having been part of the team's recent problems. His January camp along with a decent shift off the bench in the loss to Panama helped his case, but by no means is he a lock. Without Tim Weah, Christian Pulisic, or even Alex Zendejas on this roster, the U.S. team is short on players who attack from wide positions. Players like Diego Luna, Malik Tillman, or either Aaronson brother can play outside as a second position, but that isn't a strength of this team. And all those players could bring a lot to the team if they could also thrive on the wings. Haji Wright plays on the wing a lot for Coventry, but he frequently tries to cut inside. Wright is just one of the many players who has been around the team for years but who shouldn't be considered a lock anymore. Quinn Sullivan is more comfortable playing outside than most players on this roster. Attacking midfield is very interesting because Gio Reyna is not on the team due to the Club World Cup (although it is not a given he would have made it anyway given his lack of minutes). Diego Luna is in a great position now given his contributions this year which is reflected by the complements from Pochettino. Malik Tillman is coming off a great season but is under some pressure given that he has never seen his club form translate over to the national team and that needs to happen soon. The Aaronson brothers are also key to watch. Brenden was left off the USMNT roster in March and that might have been a blessing in disguise as he was 6000 miles removed from the disaster that unfolded. But it also showed that Pochettino is hesitant with him. Meanwhile Paxten has been involved with the USMNT before, but this is different. This past season, he was on loan to FC Utrecht and emerged as one of the top young players in the Eredivisie. Pepi made a great impression with the team under Pochettino in the fall and likely remains in good standing. Balogun is different because he's not in a great position with his club and might have lost his starting position heading into next year. Josh Sargent, meanwhile, was left off this roster due to Pochettino's decision. That leaves us with three center forwards on this roster. Damion Downs is in a slightly different position than White or Agyemang. He's a forward but this is his first USMNT and his youth national team experience is also limited. He is coming off a very good season with Cologne where he scored 11 goals across all competitions and helped the team to promotion to the Bundesliga. That gives him a great stage heading into year before the World Cup. But there is also a longer-term play for him. Even if he doesn't make the 2026 World Cup team, he is an important prospect for the future. Goalkeeping continues to be a big question mark for the team given that Matt Turner is still the No. 1 and has only rarely played in England over the past two seasons. He remains the USMNT starter because no one else has made a compelling case. But if he continues to be a backup at the club level, Turner is at risk every time he reports to USMNT duty. One bad camp could see him moving to a backup role there as well. In recent camps, it appeared that Zack Steffen and Patrick Schulte were the ones pushing him. Will Matt Freese and Chris Brady push Turner?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid are reportedly in the final stages of negations with Benfica to bring Álvaro Carreras to the Spanish capital. After signing zero players in the winter transfer window, Real Madrid are focused on building their defense this summer. The club already signed Dean Huijsen and Trent Alexander-Arnold, and now are closing in on a major left back reinforcement. Despite “arduous” negotiations, Real Madrid are reportedly confident they will have the fullback in a white shirt in time for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. Carreras is coming off an impressive 2024–25 season for Benfica. The Spaniard made 50 appearances across all competitions for the Portuguese side and played a pivotal role in Benfica's second-place league finish, as well as their deep run in the Taça de Portugal. Real Madrid are in desperate need of a young, talented defender like Carreras with this summer's FIFA Club World Cup just one week away. Ferland Mendy is expected to miss the entire tournament due to injury, leaving Fran García as the only natural left back in Alonso's squad. He, along with Huijsen and Alexander-Arnold, would form an almost completely-revamped backline for Los Blancos after a season marred by defense struggles and injuries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. State Department has sought to justify a travel ban that leaves nationals from over a dozen countries at risk of being blocked from entering the United States for the FIFA World Cup or the Olympic Games, saying that addressing security concerns is “part of what it means to host an event.” In a press briefing on Thursday afternoon, the State Department principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott was quizzed by journalists following the announcement of full bans for citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Partial restrictions have also been imposed on the entry of nationals from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. While President Trump's executive order, signed on Wednesday, contains exemptions for nationals who would be entering the country as athletes for major sporting events, as well as support staff and immediate relatives of athletes or teams, there are no such assurances for fans. Haiti's ability to play in this summer's Concacaf Gold Cup appeared to be confirmed on Thursday, having initially been placed into doubt by the executive order. This is because the order made a specified exemption for the World Cup and Olympics, but added other events would be assessed as whether they are deemed sufficiently “major” by the Secretary of State Marco Rubio. A State Department spokesperson simply told The Athletic: “We are implementing the President's directive to secure U.S. borders and protect American communities and citizens.” There was less reassuring news, however, for supporters of these nations. “I think this goes to the exact same consideration. This is part of what it means to host an event. Trump's executive order describes Iran as a “state sponsor of terrorism,” alleging that the state “regularly fails to cooperate with the United States Government in identifying security risks.” Venezuelan nationals are accused of overstaying their visas at a rate of just under 10 per cent when visiting the country on a short-term tourist or business visas, while Trump's order claimed that “hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden Administration.” The email stated: “Importantly, a carveout has been secured for athletes and essential support personnel.” It described this is as critical protection that will allow Team USA athletes, coaches, and operational staff to continue international travel in support of elite sport competition and qualification.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>INGLEWOOD, Calif. — After Thursday's stunning loss to Panama, the U.S. men's national team promised a response. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino assured fuming fans that a sleepy CONCACAF Nations League semifinal “didn't describe, or doesn't describe, how we are.” Players said they'd “look in the mirror” and “raise the bar.” And yet, in Sunday's third-place match against Canada, they did none of that. They lost 2-1 to their northern neighbors, and deserved every last ounce of the defeat. They managed one solitary shot on goal over the game's first 84 minutes. In the face of criticism and doubts, they talked about how, “if we want to be praised, we have to give people something to praise us about,” as midfielder Tyler Adams said Saturday. Instead, they regressed, and further disillusioned their supporters, and inflamed doubts about their readiness for a World Cup on home soil next summer. All involved promised that, after the 1-0 loss to Panama, Sunday's performance would be better. This Nations League consolation match would “be an important game to see how we react,” Pochettino said Saturday. “Mentality obviously needs to change,” Adams said hours later. “We're gonna come out with that fighting spirit,” Tim Weah added. In the interim, they had one-on-one talks and a “beautiful meeting,” Weah said, in which Pochettino pleaded for “killer mentality” and more. The message, Weah said: “We have to want it. In a stadium that was once again nine-tenths empty at kickoff, they played dull soccer, and conceded a 27th-minute goal before they'd even taken a shot of their own. Playing in his first competitive match for the national team, he started an attacking move from the right side of midfield, and, with a driving off-ball run, propelled it into the penalty box. It was the exact type of initiative that the U.S. lacked Thursday — and has often lacked under multiple managers. At the end of his run, Luna received a pass in stride. Neither, though, could erase the mediocrity around them. Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, the team's two Italy-based stars, were quiet. Adams and Weah looked nothing like their typically active selves. "It's just the little things ... duels, tackles, leaving your mark on the field, not being naive in certain moments, being a little bit more clever — all the details of the game that, I feel like, when I watch people play with their clubs, we do. And then when we come here, sometimes I think we forget a little bit what the games are gonna give us." (Canada head coach Jesse Marsch was red carded for protesting one of the no-calls.) And that's how it ended, just as a friendly between these two teams ended in September, with the U.S. beaten — and with all sorts of questions swirling about the talent, passion, ceiling and capabilities of these U.S. players. It ended with Pochettino "disappointed," again, and reaching for reasons that the medium-term future, in 2026, could still be bright. But he couldn't offer clear rationale for why they shouldn't be, other than: "In football, anything can happen." And as he rose to depart his postgame press conference, he apologized to everyone present, saying that he felt "shame" after the two losses, and promising, again, that "next time" would be different. Later, as Pochettino slumped in his shotgun seat on the team bus, Adams was asked whether he, like fans, is concerned one year out from the World Cup. We didn't show up in this window here.</p>

PSG's Ousmane Dembele runs for the ball during the Champions League round of 16 first leg soccer match between Paris Saint-Germain and Liverpool in Paris, France, Wednesday, March 5, 2025. FIFA's newly expanded Club World Cup kicks off in Miami on June 14, featuring some of soccer's biggest stars like Lionel Messi and greatest teams like Real Madrid. This is world governing body FIFA's big play to get a stronghold in the club game. Until now, club soccer's marquee events have been regional competitions such as the prestigious Champions League, which is organized by European soccer body UEFA. Here is what to know about the Club World Cup. The final is July 13 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. The Club World Cup has been expanded from seven teams to 32 and will emulate the men's and women's World Cups. Eight groups of four teams will play in a round robin mini league, with the top two advancing to a knockout stage, which runs from the round of 16 through to the final. Staged in the United States, host cities include Atlanta, Cincinnati, Charlotte, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York/New Jersey, Orlando, Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington, D.C. Some of Europe's biggest teams will take part, including Real Madrid, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Juventus, this year's Champions League winner Paris Saint-Germain and runner-up Inter Milan. From South America, top Brazilian clubs Fluminense, Flamengo, Palmeiras and Botafogo — all recent winners of Copa Libertadores, South America's top clup competition — will participate, while River Plate and Boca Juniors will represent Argentina. Inter Miami, Seattle Sounders and LAFC lead the U.S. charge. Notable absentees include European giants Barcelona, Liverpool and Manchester United, who failed to meet FIFA's convoluted qualifying criteria based on winning continental titles like the Champions League over the previous four years and ranking points. Kylian Mbappé, Vinícius Júnior and Jude Bellingham are in Madrid's star-studded squad, while Manchester City has Erling Haaland and Ballon d'Or winner Rodri. Harry Kane, Lautaro Martínez, Ousmane Dembele and Champions League final player of the match Désiré Doué will also be there. His Saudi team Al Nassr failed to qualify, but he fueled speculation about a possible move to another club in a recent social media post, while FIFA President Gianni Infantino said the Portuguese star could end up playing in the Club World Cup because of a unique transfer window. There will be Saudi involvement though in the form of Al-Hilal. Only Brazilian team Corinthians broke Europe's winning run in 17 years. An expanded tournament will give more South American teams the chance to test themselves against their European counterparts. Saudi Arabia has made a big push in recent years to become a player in global soccer and has attracted superstars like Ronaldo, Neymar and Karim Benzema to the oil-rich kingdom, as well as winning the right to stage the World Cup in 2034. Inter Miami has already announced itself to the world after luring Messi and Luis Suarez to MLS and can further enhance its reputation. For European giants Madrid and Manchester City, the Club World Cup could see them add some shine to what has been a disappointing season for both after relinquishing their titles. Every game of the Club World Cup is streamed live on DAZN.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Uzbekistan qualified for its debut soccer World Cup on Thursday night, becoming the first ever Central Asian country to make it to the sport's global showpiece. A 0-0 draw against the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi secured the White Wolves a top-two finish in Group A of Asian Qualifiers, and a ticket to the tournament next summer in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Uzbekistan goalkeeper Utkir Yusupov's six saves, including a last-second stop, guaranteed his team a priceless point, to proceed with one game of qualifying remaining. Fans celebrated the news across the soccer-obsessed nation, with people taking to the streets to cheer and march, with traditional music and songs. President Shavkat Mirziyoyev called qualification “a brilliant result, which will be written in golden letters in the annals of our national sport,” in a statement posted online. The team's historic achievement is no major surprise to followers of Asian soccer, given the burgeoning talent among its squad. The side's talented 21-year-old center back Abdukodir Khusanov now plays for Manchester City, having signed for the English giants in January for a reported £33.6 million (about $45 million). Striker Eldor Shomurodov has played in Italy's top league since 2020, while promising forward Abbosbek Fayzullaev, currently at CSKA Moscow, was named Asia's Youth Player of the Year two years ago. The 2026 World Cup will for the first time expand from 32 teams to 48 teams, giving each continent, including Asia, additional spots, though qualifying automatically – with a game to spare – suggests Uzbekistan would have made it even under the previous format. While soccer has long been beloved across the Central Asian region, that popularity has never been matched by international success at senior level. With qualification secured, Uzbekistan's fans can celebrate on home turf when they face Qatar in the final match of the round, in the capital Tashkent on Wednesday. Just hours after Uzbekistan's triumph, Jordan become the next Asian country to make history, securing its first ever trip to the World Cup, defeating Oman 3-0. Elsewhere in the region, Japan, Australia, Iran, and South Korea – all World Cup regulars – have also booked their places at next year's finals.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Richarlison of Brazil warms up prior to the FIFA World Cup 2026 Qualifier match between Ecuador and Brazil at Estadio Monumental Isidro Romero Carbo on June 05, 2025 in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Catch Sportstar's highlights of the Ecuador vs Brazil FIFA World Cup 2026 CONMEBOL qualifier at the Banco Pichincha Monumental Stadium. Brazil remains in fourth place with 22 points; it faces next third-placed Paraguay, which won 2–0 against Uruguay earlier. The 15th round of the FIFA World Cup 2026 CONMEBOL qualifiers is underway as teams from South America race towards booking a spot in football's biggest competition. It is just one of those underwhelming contests that make it a difficult watch for both fans and neutrals. It is not the best of starts for Carlo Ancelotti as Brazil manager, but with just one game in, it would be harsh to make any judgements. Estupinan drives forward and takes a shot at goal. However, he fails to keep his effort on target. It has been an underwhelming contest, to say the least. Barring any last-minute surprises, nothing much to say about this match in terms of excitement. Casemiro gets a good connection with the ball but Valle remains alert to get down quickly and make the save. A good spell of pressure from Brazil in and around the Ecuador box but the Selecao are not being able to find that final ball to create scoring opportunities. Brazil subs: IN- Martinelli, Cunha OUT - Estevao, Richarlison We should see both managers making use of their substitutes as the match hits the hour mark and scores remain at 0-0. Ecuador has already made a half-time change bringing on Preciado in place of Minda. However, his effort is blocked as Ecuador gets the ball to safety. Right now, it is mostly a midfield battle. Ecuador has yet again made a brighter start in the second half, as Brazil has mostly resorted to defending in the early minutes. There is hardly much to say from this half. With half-time nearing, it is difficult to pick a winner in this match. Both teams have shown positive signs in the final third. Better finishing will be the main agenda of both teams. It was a difficult chance as the ball came at Yeboah with a fair amount of speed, which made it difficult for him to control the ball. Brazil is going forward with a lot more ease now than it was in the early minutes of the first-half. This time, Vinicius Jr makes a darting run from the left and tries to get past his marker Caicedo, but the midfielder shows his defensive skills by reading Vinicius' ploy and pokes the ball out for a corner. Another positive run from Estevao as he makes his way inside the Ecuador box and tries to find a teammate in the middle with a low cross. Alisson comes out to punch the ball but misses. Yeboah tries his luck from an ambitious distance, but he needed something special to beat Alisson from such a long way out. The initial shot is blocked, but the rebound falls to Vinicius Jr, who goes for a shot himself. The Brazil defence has remained composed under pressure but its forwards have not offered much in the attacking third. Brazil's Gerson and Ecuador's Angulo are both down after a nasty clash of bodies. However, it does not look serious and they should both be able to continue after some medical attention. Angulo makes a dangerous run inside the Brazil box from the left and tries to find a teammate with a cutback but his pass is intercepted and the ball is cleared to safety. The game has a good attacking tempo in these early minutes. ICYMI - Ecuador has had a late replacement between the nets. Valle replaces Galindez who had some issue during the pre-match warmup. An ironic fact to note - Brazil, known for its iconic yellow coloured jersey, is actually playing in blue, being the away team. Home team Ecuador, meanwhile, sports a bright yellow-coloured jersey. They would surely like some of that Samba flair against the country known for introducing Joga Bonito in the footballing world. Ancelotti, who Real Madrid to several titles with Vinicius Jr. as a player, said that his unique ability to unsettle opposing defences made him a vital asset. Casemiro returns to the Brazil squad after not playing in national colours for about a year. However, new head coach Carlo Ancelotti, who has managed Casemiro during his time in Real Madrid, still feels he has a lot to give in national colours. In terms of absentees for Brazil, apart for Neymar, Raphinha is a big miss as the forward is out injured. Brazil is set to play Ecuador in a FIFA World Cup 2026 CONMEBOL qualifier at the Banco Pichincha Monumental Stadium on Thursday (Friday, according to IST). Ecuador: Valle (GK); Ordonez, Pacho, Hincapie(C); Franco, Caicedo, Vite, Estupinan; Yeboah, Angulo, Minda Brazil: Alisson(GK); Sandro, Ribeiro, Marquinhos(C), Vanderson; Gerson, Casemiro, Guimaraes; Vinicius Jr, Richarlison; Estevao Ecuador will host Brazil in a FIFA World Cup 2026 CONMEBOL qualifier at the Banco Pichincha Monumental Stadium on Thursday (Friday according to IST). Ecuador has been in good form in the World Cup 2026 qualifiers, winning seven out of the 14 matches it has played so far. Currently, it sits second in the table with 23 points from 14 games. Brazil, on the other hand, has not had the best of campaigns till now going by its lofty standards. It has lost five matches till now and sits fourth in the table with 21 points. However, the five-time World Cup champion ushers in a new era with Carlo Ancelotti at the helm, with the Italian preparing himself to take charge of his first match as Brazil manager.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vincen Kompany is running thin on options in defense, so he's going to have to improvise this summer. Right after the international break, Bayern Munich gets set to embark upon their FIFA Club World Cup journey in the United States, with their first match set to take place on June 15th vs. Auckland City in Cincinatti, Ohio at the TQL Stadium. But nothing is a given, especially with the amount of injuries Bayern has to the squad. Bayern head coach Vincent Kompany is really going to be short on central defenders for the tournament. Dayot Upamecano, Kim Min-jae, and Hiroki Ito are all still out injured, and Bayer Leverkusen are still demanding a high fee for Bayern to pay to have Jonathan Tah officially available from the start of the tournament as opposed to from July 1st onward. As things stand, Josip Stanišić is the only fit senior center-back available for Kompany. Nonetheless, per information from tz's Philipp Kessler and Manuel Bonke (as per @iMiaSanMia), Kompany and his coaching staff is seriously considering the idea of having Leon Goretzka partner Stanišić in the center of defense from the start of the tournament. The Belgian manager really does not have many other options available, and while Goretzka might not be the most popular candidate to line up at the heart of the back line, he has played there before. While Kompany has not used Goretzka at center back before, Thomas Tuchel did in the first round DFB-Pokal clash last season against SC Preußen Münster — a match where Bayern won 4-0, keeping a clean sheet. Academy player Tarek Buchmann would not be an option with how little football he has played over the past twelve months due to injury problems and one of the only other options would be trying Adam Aznou, a left-back by trade, at center-back, which is far more of a risk despite the youngster doing well for himself on loan at Real Valladolid.
