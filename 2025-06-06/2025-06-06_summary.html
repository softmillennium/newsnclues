Migrants and ICE agents are being forced to live in shipping containers on a US military base in hazardous conditions.

The Trump administration could have sent eight migrants with deportation orders and the immigration agents who were escorting them to a facility in the U.S. after a federal judge recently barred officials from deporting them to war-torn South Sudan, where they could face persecution or torture.

Instead the administration sent them to U.S. Naval Base Camp Lemonnier in the East African country of Djibouti, where a court filing on Thursday said they face illness, the threat of rocket fire from nearby Yemen, temperatures that soar past 100°F daily, and rancid smoke from nearby burn pits where human waste and trash are incinerated.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, blamed U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy for “stranding” the 13 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and eight detainees at the naval base, where they have been housed since late May in a metal shipping container converted into a conference room with just six bunk beds.

The administration has frequently attacked judges for issuing rulings that have interfered with President Donald Trump's ability to carry out his anti-immigration agenda.

But Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, pointed to court transcripts that showed the Trump administration had requested the migrants and agents be sent to Camp Lemonnier.

“No one asked them to do and no court order forces them to do it,” said Reichlin-Melnick Thursday.

In a court transcript, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign told Murphy that “bringing them back would be a much broader remedy than necessary” and suggested the detainees could have a “reasonable fear interview where they are” in Djibouti to determine if they had a credible fear of persecution or torture if they were deported. Murphy had instructed officials to arrange reasonable fear interviews when he ruled in May that they could not be sent to South Sudan.

This is a LIE. It was ICE which made the decision to hold the men at that base. No one asked them to do and no court order forces them to do it.In fact, it was ICE who ASKED THE JUDGE for permission to hold the men in Djibouti! Here's the transcript from the court hearing. https://t.co/J8FOAAB7ib pic.twitter.com/op1qimESi7

“The judge did NOT require that anyone be ‘stranded' anywhere,” said Reichlin-Melnick. “In fact, it was the Trump administration that asked the judge for permission to hold the men in Djibouti! ICE could literally bring the men to any other U.S. base (or back to the U.S.) at any time!”

Murphy's ruling in May interrupted a deportation flight carrying the migrants — who have been convicted of crimes and are from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan, and Vietnam — to South Sudan.

The judge said the flight violated his previous order from April 18, which prohibited the administration from sending immigrants to third countries without providing them a chance to request humanitarian protections. That ruling was underpinned by the Convention Against Torture, which bars governments from deporting people to countries where they could be face torture.

“The judge gave the government a choice as to how to remedy the government's violation of the court's order — either return them and comply with the order in the United States or comply with the order overseas,” Trina Realmuto, a lawyer for the immigrants, told The Intercept. “The government opted to comply overseas after telling the court that they had the ability to do so. This is a situation the government both created and can remedy if it so chooses.”

The court filing on Thursday by Mellissa Harper of the Office of Refugee Resettlement described how within 72 hours of arriving at the makeshift detention facility in Djibouti, the agents and migrants began to suffer from symptoms for bacterial respiratory infections, including “coughing, difficulty breathing, fever, and achy joints.”

The filing explained that they are unable to get tested to determine what the illness is, and there is only a small supply of inhalers, Tylenol, eye drops, and nasal spray to treat the symptoms.

Based on what was described, Politico's Kyle Cheney asked: “Why is the Trump administration forcing them to stay there?”

“ICE's claims of difficulties here are ENTIRELY self-inflicted,” said Reichlin-Melnick. “THEY asked the judge for permission to hold the men in Djibouti. The plaintiffs wanted the men brought back here. I have sympathy for the low-level officers stuck there, but it's ALL their bosses' fault.”

The administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay Murphy's order requiring screenings for the migrants, claiming that ruling violated officials' authority to deport immigrants to third countries if their home countries won't take them back.

But in the case of at least one of the migrants, Jesus Munoz Gutierrez, the government of his home country of Mexico was not informed that he had been sent to Djibouti.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested last month that Gutierrez could be repatriated if U.S. followed protocols to send him back to Mexico.

Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director for Detention Watch Network, told Newsweek that the administration's insistence on detaining the migrants in a shipping container at Camp Lemonniere is “the latest move in Trump's shocking expansion of third country deportations.”

“By expelling people out of sight and out of mind to remote prisons and war-torn, unstable countries,” said Ghandehari, “the Trump regime is attempting to normalize the offshoring of immigration detention and third country deportations as a new and expanded model of incarceration and deportation.”

Ghandehari added that “the use of shipping containers to detain people is heinous and enraging — and coupled with the extreme heat, disease, and threats of rocket attacks in Djibouti, can be deadly.”

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

The GOP budget's cuts to Medicaid threaten to decimate 59 trauma recovery centers in 15 states.

The GOP's proposed cuts to Medicaid could take away an important lifeline in the effort to combat violence. Despite significant reductions in violent crime since the pandemic, violence and the fear of violence remain a stubborn feature of daily life in too many communities across the U.S. A new strategy of using Medicaid funding to support community-based trauma counseling to reduce violence has growing support at the state level, but the Republican budget bill that passed the house would cut more than $800 billion in Medicaid funding over the next 10 years — and most likely close the door on this essential tool.

As experts on public safety, we have seen firsthand the importance of childhood trauma in driving violence. At Newark's HUBB Arts and Trauma Center (HUBB ATC) we see every day the struggles of young people to overcome trauma in their daily lives and to take the difficult steps needed to break the cycle of violence.

Both of us experienced untreated childhood traumas and understand the need for services tailored to young people's experiences. At 15, Alex Vitale was stabbed by a home intruder. While the police and an ambulance arrived quickly and a report was taken and medical care given, no efforts were made to provide follow up mental health care. For years, he suffered from anxiety and slept with a weapon next to his bed.

As a child, Al-Tariq Best endured a range of traumatic experiences, including domestic violence, murder, drug exposure, and sexual abuse. He witnessed firsthand the physical abuse his mother suffered at the hands of her partners. After his mother made the difficult decision to leave and eventually divorce his father, they became entangled with another abusive man who inflicted relentless physical, emotional, and psychological abuse upon the family.

Growing up in this chaos fostered a dangerous normalization of abuse, contributing to their own emotional insecurities and distorted perceptions of relationships. As they matured into adulthood, this unresolved trauma often manifested as anger and unhealthy dynamics in their own relationships.

Research into violent crime has shown that past trauma plays a major role in predicting future violence, especially among young people. When people are exposed to or directly experience traumatic events such as suffering domestic violence, witnessing a shooting, or even regularly hearing about the violent deaths of friends and family members, it can lead to forms of post-traumatic stress, similar to that seen in combat veterans. This stress can lead to irritability, interrupted sleep, inability to concentrate, and heightened levels of fear and anxiety, all of which are associated with higher risk of involvement in violence.

Children are especially susceptible to this dynamic. Children are more likely to live in extreme poverty and be exposed to domestic abuse and community violence. Over 20 percent of children in the U.S. grow up in poverty, and youth violence is heavily concentrated within exactly this population. At the same time, they are less well equipped to manage this trauma because they are still developing emotionally and intellectually, making them more likely to engage in impulsive and poorly thought-out behavior. This contributes not just to higher levels of violence but also to suicides and harmful substance use.

Over the last decade, new efforts have emerged to address trauma at the community level as part of an overall strategy to reduce community violence. Trauma recovery centers (TRCs) have been created across the U.S. that put clinical mental health workers in community-based settings to engage with people who have suffered trauma. The National Alliance of Trauma Recovery Centers reports that there are 59 such centers in 15 states that attempt to overcome the stigma too often associated with receiving mental health services.

In New Jersey, Newark Community Street Team, a community-based violence reduction program created in 2014, opened its Trauma Recovery Center in 2020 and serves people who have experienced a broad range of traumas at no cost. The Grady TRC in Atlanta is based at a local hospital and helps people who have been the victims of violence get their lives back on track through medical services, psychological therapy, and essential social services that often harness victim services resources. The Downtown Women's Center operated by UC San Francisco in Los Angeles specializes in assisting women victims of violence in English and Spanish, regardless of immigration status.

Several states have attempted to support this work by authorizing TRCs to bill Medicaid for the delivery of these essential health services. Medicaid provides medical coverage for the poor and disabled through grants to states, which then decide how best to spend the money within federal guidelines. Medicaid is an essential source of revenue for funding hospitals and clinics in poor and underserved communities. California, Oregon, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, and Illinois have all passed laws enabling TRCs to receive Medicaid reimbursements for their work. This has allowed for a significant expansion of services in these states as part of the effort to break the cycle of violence.

While some existing TRCs in the U.S. serve children, many do not, and none exclusively serve youth. The HUBB ATC that Al-Tariq Best founded wants to change that. It has served young people in Newark at high risk of involvement in violence since 2013 by utilizing a mixture of arts programing, mentoring, social services, and mental health support to stabilize young people in crisis. The HUBB ATC is part of a citywide effort to build community capacity to stop violence outside the traditional use of police, courts, and prisons. Together, these groups have helped drive down violent crime in Newark to historic lows.

While The HUBB ATC has long employed licensed mental health workers to help young people in crisis, the need is much greater than the current capacity. Over the last few years, the organization has received grants and in-kind donations to build out a multifaceted youth trauma center that would allow for both situational and intensive long-term therapeutic interventions.

Unfortunately, operational funding has failed to materialize. New Jersey has been considering a bill to allow the use of Medicaid reimbursements, but that bill is likely to be moot given the massive cuts to Medicaid contained in the GOP budget bill. The proposed $800 billion reduction would make expansion in Medicaid coverage highly unlikely since states will be under huge pressure to make up for the forthcoming shortfalls.

Hopefully the Senate will take steps to block the Medicaid cuts and New Jersey and other states can move forward with this essential service that will both improve the mental health of young people and help reduce violence. Otherwise, it will be up to local and state governments as well as philanthropy to try and make up the difference. The evidence is clear that youth violence is a public health issue that is best dealt with through community-centered behavioral health interventions and social services, not more intensive policing and mass incarceration.

Organizers in Louisiana are fighting the Trump administration's efforts to expand methane export infrastructure.

Promising U.S. “energy dominance,” the Trump administration is moving to accelerate fossil fuel production. Key to this agenda is the approval of liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities across Gulf Coast communities that are disproportionately Black, Brown, and low-income, long treated as expendable “sacrifice zones” by the fossil fuel industry.

Just recently, on May 23, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reauthorized the massive CP2 LNG in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, which will be the biggest LNG export facility in the U.S.

Local organizers and climate groups have been fighting the expansion of these “methane export facilities” which they say will intensify climate chaos and environmental racism. To try to halt them, they're focusing on key actors behind these fossil fuel projects: the big financiers and insurers whose services these projects need in order to gain regulatory approval and to be built and operated.

A new report by the Rainforest Action Network (RAN) maps out the known insurers of the buildout of LNG export facilities in Southwest Louisiana and discusses the numerous financial and reputational risks these companies face in propping up an industry tied to a volatile market fueling climate crisis and threatening local communities.

“They're financing and insuring environmental racism because these projects are overwhelmingly situated in Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities they feel are the path of least resistance,” Roishetta Ozane, founder of the Vessel Project in Lake Charles, Louisiana, told Truthout.

U.S. exports of LNG, or fracked gas that has been cooled into liquid to ship, have boomed over the past decade. LNG has been promoted by the fossil fuel industry as a cleaner “bridge fuel” toward renewable energy, a debunked claim that some view as a form of greenwashing. The production, transport, processing, and burning of fracked gas releases large amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas that is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.

The U.S. is the world's top exporter of fracked gas. In recent years, the fossil fuel industry and its Wall Street investors have sought to expand U.S. LNG export facilities. Immediately after his January 2025 inauguration, Donald Trump restarted applications for new LNG export terminals that were paused by Joe Biden a year earlier.

The epicenter of the buildout has been the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast, where there are currently around two dozen LNG expansion projects being constructed or proposed. These facilities are located in places like Port Arthur, Texas, and Cameron Parish, Louisiana, communities that are overwhelmingly Black, Brown, and low-income, and where clusters of toxic refining and petrochemical plants have long operated.

The United Nations has called areas like these “sacrifice zones,” defined as “extremely contaminated areas where vulnerable and marginalized groups bear a disproportionate burden of the health, human rights and environmental consequences of exposure to pollution and hazardous substances.” Research shows that local Black, Brown, and Indigenous workers do not benefit equitably from the jobs and other economic benefits the fossil fuel industry often promises when building new facilities.

A 2024 Greenpeace report found that the building of planned LNG projects would result annually in 149 premature deaths and $2.33 billion in health costs, with areas in Southwest Louisiana “slated to suffer the worst air pollution impacts per capita” and with air pollution from LNG terminals disproportionately affecting Black and Brown residents.

According to a new report by RAN, over 20 additional LNG expansion projects have been proposed in the Gulf Coast region in addition to six existing export terminals. These enormous projects have names like Sabine Pass LNG, Cameron LNG, and Calcasieu Pass LNG. Their corporate backers include Sempra, Energy Transfer, Cheniere, Kimmeridge, and Venture Global.

These facilities, however, are far from uncontested, facing major opposition from community organizers like Roishetta Ozane.

“I would say that if you insure CP2 you are insuring the death of my children and my community. We are already suffering from the pollution that's coming from the surrounding facilities. We can't take anymore.”

A mother of six who lives just outside Lake Charles, Louisiana, Ozane founded the Vessel Project in 2020 amid her efforts to help the community respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and displacement from Hurricanes Laura and Delta. The Vessel Project uses mutual aid to build community and create the conditions for sustained organizing for environmental justice.

“We make sure that people's immediate needs are met before we talk about stopping an LNG facility,” she told Truthout. “That way, we've been able to grow our base of community members who show up at meetings and town halls and who travel with us to D.C. or New York City.”

Ozane spoke of the environmental and health fallouts her community has suffered living “right in the midst of a mixture of industries,” including explosions, fires, and smoke clouds at petrochemical plants, with consequences for her own family. “We get all the cumulative impacts living in a fenceline community,” she said. “My children have asthma and eczema. My son has epilepsy, which I believe was exacerbated by the pollution from the facilities.”

As Ozane responded to crisis after crisis, she started making connections between the environmental racism and extreme weather her community experienced and the wider climate crisis tied to local industries. “I was trying to connect the dots for people,” she said. “All of these facilities are releasing gas into the air, and it's what's warming our planet. It's what's causing these storms to be more severe.”

Organizing to halt the buildout of LNG export facilities and other fossil fuel infrastructure has led Ozane and others toward a concerted strategy: pressuring big financiers and insurers to stop propping up these projects.

“The banks and the insurance companies are the ones actually supporting the fossil fuel industry behind the scenes,” Ruth Breech of RAN, and a coauthor of the RAN report, told Truthout.

The past decade has seen the climate and environmental justice movement target the money behind the fossil fuel industry, such as banks JPMorgan and Citi, asset managers like BlackRock and Vanguard, and insurers like AIG and Liberty Mutual. While ExxonMobil or Chevron may cling to its core business of oil and gas production, these financial firms are more diversified, risk-averse and susceptible to public shaming.

“If our elected officials are going to approve these projects, then our hope lies in the banks and the investors and the insurance companies,” said Ozane.

Ozane co-leads the Gulf South Fossil Finance Hub, a coalition aimed at bringing pressure from local communities to bear on these financial giants. “We bring frontline folks in front of these banks and insurance companies to say you're insuring and financing environmental racism,” she said.

More than any other financial backers, insurance corporations may be most vulnerable around fossil fuels, since climate chaos presents an existential threat to the industry's business model.

The RAN report, which the Vessel Project and Gulf South Fossil Finance Hub signed onto, maps out some of the known insurers, based on information from FOIA requests and lawsuit filings, behind Southwest Louisiana's LNG export buildout. For example, insurers behind Cameron LNG include Chubb, AIG, Allianz, Liberty Mutual, Munich Re, Swiss Re, Zurich, Tokio Marine, The Hartford, and others, according to RAN.

The report highlights the significant risks for insurers in underwriting the Gulf Coast LNG buildout, including financial instability tied to regulatory and construction delays and the problem of oversupply and overcapacity with these facilities. Multiple reports warn that U.S. shale production is facing decline in prices and market volatility.

The report also notes the reputational and financial risks to insurers that prop up an industry that perpetuates harmful health impacts, safety hazards, climate risks, and disruptions to local ecosystems. LNG export facilities have been plagued by thousands of permit violations and extensive operational problems and accidents, with one of the most infamous being a 2022 explosion and fire at Freeport LNG that led to an eight-month shutdown.

Both Breech and Ozane emphasized the hypocrisy behind the insurance industry's continued underwriting of fossil fuels. “We're seeing people across the nation lose their home insurance coverage because of the impacts of climate change,” said Breech. “Then we're seeing these insurance companies continue to provide insurance for new fossil fuel projects.”

Ozane said it's frustrating to see insurers prop up an industry in her community that is driving the very climate chaos that's making home insurance in Louisiana unaffordable. “For insurance companies to insure one of these climate monsters, and then turn around and not insure the people who live in the communities at a reasonable rate, is outright wrong,” she said.

For RAN and the Vessel Project, the global insurance powerhouse Chubb has been a key focus. Breech says Chubb CEO Evan Greenberg is “an influencer personality” within the insurance industry, similar to JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon in banking. Chubb has also been open to engaging with community members. Ozane has met with representatives from Chubb several times, bringing her children to the meetings. “They know me by name,” she says.

In 2024, Chubb reported dropping 32 major oil and gas clients who didn't meet its methane emissions standards. Chubb has dropped its coverage of the Rio Grande LNG, a proposed LNG export terminal in Brownsville, Texas, and it ruled out insuring the East African Crude Oil Pipeline. As recently reported by Inside Climate News, Chubb also dropped its coverage of Venture Global's Calcasieu Pass LNG.

But for organizers like Ozane, Chubb isn't going far enough. She wants them to rule out insuring another LNG export terminal, Venture Global's huge CP2, which just received FERC approval. Ozane told Truthout that she's currently trying to arrange a “toxic tour” for FERC so the commission can see the cumulative impacts of the fossil fuel industry on her community.

According to the Sierra Club LNG Export Tracker, CP2's annual emissions will be the equivalent of 54 coal burning power plants once two phases of expansion are completed.

CP2's insurers are currently unknown, RAN reports.

“If you're insuring this project, you're ensuring this community's destruction,” Ozane said. “It would be easy for Chubb to say, if CP2 gets all of its permits, we're not going to insure them.”

Truthout contacted Chubb to ask if the company was insuring CP2, and also if its decision to drop coverage of Calcasieu Pass LNG could mean Chubb would decide to not insure CP2, but received no response.

RAN told Truthout that it's demanding Chubb drop its coverage of Cameron LNG by June and Freeport LNG by October, and that it stops insuring all “methane terminals.”

Chubb CEO Evan Greenberg took in $82 million in total compensation between 2022 and 2024. By contrast, the per capita income in Lake Charles, Louisiana, is $35,847, with a poverty rate of 23.2 percent, according to census data.

The RAN report demands that banks and insurers stop supporting fossil fuel expansion projects. It also demands that banks and insurance companies “follow a human rights due diligence framework” and consult with community leaders and organizations from municipalities and parishes where LNG export facilities are being sited to identify and assess human rights risks, and for these companies to do their own site visits to conduct human rights, environmental and environmental justice assessments.

“We're talking about serious human rights implications in these projects,” said Breech. “Southwest Louisiana is not an energy sacrifice zone, and it's not acceptable to have all of these proposals in this area.”

With hurricane season approaching, Ozane stresses the urgency of halting the LNG export buildout that's blanketing her community. She is hosting a hurricane preparedness festival highlighting the intersection of fossil fuel pollution and climate-induced disasters.

Truthout asked Ozane what she would say to Chubb CEO Evan Greenberg if she could speak directly to him.

“I would say that if you insure CP2 you are insuring the death of my children and my community,” she said. “We are already suffering from the pollution that's coming from the surrounding facilities. We can't take anymore.”

Truthout also asked Ozane what victory would ultimately look like for her.

“Victory looks like we are no longer dependent on fossil fuels here and that there's another economy here,” she said. “We're back to our fishermen being able to live off of fishing and oysters and shrimping. We see a beautiful coast free of the industry that's now polluting the water.”

“Victory will look like my 7-year-old going outside to play without coming back into the house saying that he can't breathe,” she says.

Backed by nearly two dozen House Democrats, the new bill would end the US supply of offensive weapons to Israel.

With over 54,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip killed by the Israeli assault and the 2 million survivors suffering from the ongoing bombings and blockade on essentials, nearly two dozens progressives in the U.S. Congress came together Thursday to call for passage of a bill that would withhold offensive weapons from Israel.

Like former Democratic U.S. President Joe Biden, Republican President Donald Trump has continued to provide diplomatic and weapons support to the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose forces have left the Palestinian enclave in ruins since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.

“Netanyahu and Trump are a lethal, unaccountable, extremist duo. Trump has bypassed congressional oversight on weapons transfers. The Israeli government is currently escalating attacks on the civilian population of Gaza. They are both out of control. Congress needs to assert its oversight authority,” said Congresswoman Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.) in a statement.

“Enough is enough,” Ramirez declared. “By introducing the Block the Bombs Act, a broad coalition is listening to the American people who don't want their taxpayers' money to continue supporting gross violations of U.S., international, and humanitarian law.”

Two former leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus — Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) — as well as Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) are spearheading the fight for the bill alongside Ramirez. Another 18 Democrats in the House of Representatives have signed on as co-sponsors, including current CPC Chair Greg Casar (D-Texas) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), the only Palestinian American in either chamber.

“For the last year and a half, Benjamin Netanyahu has laid siege to Gaza, killing at least 54,000 people, repeatedly displacing the entire population, and cutting off access to desperately needed humanitarian aid,” said Pocan. “This commonsense bill will prevent more unchecked transfers of these offensive weapons systems that are used to violate international human rights laws and hopefully help bring this devastating conflict to an end.”

Although there was a cease-fire in place for nearly two months earlier this year, Netanyahu abandoned it in March. Since then, negotiations for an end to Israel's annihilation of Gaza and the release of both Palestinians held in Israeli prisons and hostages taken by Palestinian militants in 2023 have been unsuccessful.

Throughout the war, efforts by progressives in both chambers of Congress — including multiple resolutions led by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — to block U.S. weapons that Israel uses to massacre civilians in Gaza also have not been successful. A growing number of critics across the globe condemn the U.S.-backed Israeli assault as genocide.

This morning @ramirez.house.gov, @sarajacobs.house.gov, @jayapal.house.gov, and @pocan.house.gov introduced historic legislation to stop sending bombs to the Israeli military. It should be common sense. We should not be supporting mass killing and starvation. Thank you all for your leadership.

The new bill is backed by dozens of advocacy groups that have spent the past 20 months sounding the alarm about the soaring death toll, starvation, and destruction of infrastructure in Gaza, including Amnesty International USA, Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), Council on American-Islamic Relations, Demand Progress, Human Rights Watch, IfNotNow Movement, IMEU Policy Project, Indivisible, Jewish Voice for Peace Action, Justice Democrats, Institute for Policy Studies, Progressive Democrats of America, Rabbis for Cease-Fire, Sunrise Movement, Win Without War, and Working Families Party.

“The Block the Bombs Act is a historic bill,” but also “a straightforward challenge to United States complicity in Israel's genocidal campaign in Gaza as Israeli forces block humanitarian assistance and directly target schools, hospitals, and civilians,” said CCR associate director of policy Brad Parker. “As the Israeli government escalates the murder, starvation, and forcible transfer of Palestinians with President Trump's full support, we recognize and appreciate the bold leadership of Reps. Ramirez, Jacobs, Jayapal, and Pocan.”

CCR also encouraged supporters of the bill to visit blockthebombs.org, which features a tool enabling U.S. voters to write to their members of Congress and ask them to co-sponsor the legislation, H.R. 3565.

Survey shows correlation between use of Chinese-owned platform and approval of unification with China

Taiwanese people who spend large amounts of time on TikTok are more likely to agree with some pro-China narratives, a survey has suggested.

The study, conducted by the Taiwan-based DoubleThink Lab, surveyed people across Taiwan in March, asking a series of questions about politics and democracy in Taiwan and China, and their views on unification of the two sides.

It found that among the respondents, agreement with criticisms of Taiwan's domestic issues, and with the prospect of unifying with China, rose as TikTok use increased, before dropping again among the heaviest users of more than 14 hours a week.

China's ruling Communist party (CCP) claims Taiwan is a province of China and has vowed to annex it under what it terms “reunification”, by force if necessary. Social media is a key battleground in China's information warfare, as it seeks to convince or coerce Taiwan into accepting annexation without military conflict.

The DoubleThink Lab report claimed the more active TikTok users showed stronger correlations with an openness to Chinese propaganda and the idea that unification with China is inevitable and democracy should be sacrificed for peace.

There was also correlation with unhappiness about current domestic issues, including opposition-driven accusations of judicial unfairness and erosions of free speech. Differences were stark among supporters of Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive party (DPP), which the CCP has labelled illegal separatists.

“Our analysis suggests that active TikTok use is more likely to influence users' political attitudes toward being more anti-democratic establishment and positive attitudes toward PRC governance, even among groups traditionally opposed to the CCP,” said the report's author, Eric Hsu.

The percentage of DPP supporters who used TikTok and thought it was acceptable to give up Taiwan's democratic system “for the sake of cross-strait peace” was 10 points higher than non-users, at 26.8%, the report said. And in response to statements that the DPP was “no different from the CCP and Taiwan lacks freedom of speech”, 23.9% of DPP supporters who used TikTok agreed, compared with 9.3% who were not active on the app.

TikTok is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, and fears of it being used to spread pro-CCP propaganda have already resulted in restrictions or threats of outright bans in several countries, including the US. In Taiwan, there are rules against TikTok being used on government devices.

In 2019, the Guardian revealed how ByteDance used TikTok to advance Beijing's foreign policy aims by moderating sensitive content. A 2023 study, by Rutgers University's Network Contagion Research Institute in the US, found TikTok's algorithms consistently amplify pro-CCP content and suppress anti-CCP narratives, with much of the pro-CCP content originating from state-linked entities.

ByteDance has long denied the allegations.

“From the CCP's founding, there has always been a strong emphasis on both the ‘pen' and the ‘gun' – meaning propaganda and force,” said Yu-hui Tai, an assistant professor at Taiwan's National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.

Tai said Taiwan was on the frontline of China's propaganda efforts, and its digital environment was “complex”. She added: “TikTok is not the only app young people use”, noting that Douyin – the Chinese domestic version of TikTok, which some Taiwanese also use – is very different in content and moderation to TikTok.

The Guardian has reported previously on the popularity of other Chinese apps that have increased their cultural influence among young Taiwanese.

Titus C Chen, a research fellow at Taiwan's National Chengchi University, said the vast majority of TikTok users “aren't actively seeking out political content when they use the platform”.

He said it could not be ruled out that users were just more inclined to agree with such views and so were being fed content that aligned with their interests.

“That said, it's undeniably true that TikTok's content – both its Chinese and international versions – is heavily influenced and controlled by the Chinese government,” said Chen. “So it's very unlikely you'll come across much content on TikTok that supports liberal democracy.”

Alex Chiu fell 3,000ft from a climbing route on Denali, or Mount McKinley, and was not roped up at the time

Mountaineering rangers in Alaska recovered the body of a Seattle man who died after falling 3,000ft from a climbing route on Denali, or Mount McKinley, the highest mountain in North America.

The National Park Service said that Alex Chiu, 41, was on the treacherous mountain's west buttress route when he fell from a location called Squirrel Point, about 12,000ft above sea level.

Chiu's body was transferred to the state medical examiner on Wednesday, the Denali national park and preserve said.

Two other members of Chiu's team had reported on Monday that Chui had fallen and that they had lowered themselves over the edge as far as possible but were unable to see or hear Chiu. He was not roped up at the time of the fall.

Ground and air search crews were unable to reach the site until early Wednesday because of very high winds and heavy snow. An unroped French mountaineer fell to his death near the same location in 2010. His body was never recovered.

This is the busiest time of year for climbing the peak, in May and June when climbers descend on the regional town of Talkeetna. There are currently 500 climbers on the peak and more on other mountains and glacial approaches to peaks in the spectacular range that is breathtaking but fraught with risk.

Denali is known to be deceptively dangerous, although it looks relatively benign to ordinary tourists viewing the summit on a clear day from Denali national park. Despite being lower above sea level, the mountain has a greater vertical climb from the base to the summit than the world's highest mountain, Mount Everest in the Himalayas. Climbers wanting to summit Denali must scale 18,000 vertical feet compared with Everest's 12,000ft.

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke with Prime Minister Mark Carney on Friday.Stringer/Reuters

Prime Minister Mark Carney is defending his decision to invite India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the G7 summit in Alberta this month despite an ongoing investigation into the South Asian country's involvement in the 2023 slaying of Canadian Hardeep Singh Nijjar.

Mr. Carney's predecessor Justin Trudeau publicly accused India of a role in the gangland-style murder of Mr. Nijjar, a prominent advocate for a separate state for Sikhs in the Indian state of Punjab. India has denied the allegation.

The Prime Minister declined to answer a question Friday on whether he believed Mr. Modi was involved in the death of Mr. Nijjar, who was shot dead outside a Sikh gurdwara in Surrey, B.C. “There is a legal process that is literally under way and quite advanced in Canada, and it's never appropriate to make comments with respect to those legal processes,” he said.

He offered a rationale for inviting Mr. Modi even though last year the RCMP said publicly it has strong evidence that the “highest levels” of the Indian government were involved in orchestrating a campaign of violence and intimidation on Canadian soil. 

Explainer: The G7 summit is being held just outside Calgary. Here's who will be there and what these meetings achieve

Mr. Carney said it makes sense that India as the most populous country in the world, with the fifth largest economy, should be present at this year's G7 where leaders will hold discussions on energy security, critical minerals and infrastructure projects in the developing world.

“My role as chair of the G7 it is important to invite the most important countries to attend to talk about important issues such as energy, artificial intelligence, critical minerals, and India is really at the very center of global supply chains,” Mr. Carney said.

There's been no public indication that India has agreed to co-operate in Canada's investigation of the Nijjar slaying. However, the Prime Minister said Friday both countries have resolved to “continued law enforcement dialogue.” Mr. Carney did not say if that included the Nijjar killing.

Mr. Modi indicated in a post on X Friday that he would be attending the G7 in Kananaskis June 15-17.

Canada-India relations suffered a major rupture in September, 2023, when Mr. Trudeau told Parliament that Canada's national security apparatus has reason to believe “agents of the Indian government” killed Mr. Nijjar.

Twenty months after this diplomatic breach, Canada's and India's ambassador-level posts in each other's country are still vacant.

Mr. Modi said in his post that he congratulated Mr. Carney on his election win.

“As vibrant democracies bound by deep people-to-people ties, India and Canada will work together with renewed vigour, guided by mutual respect and shared interests,” he wrote. “Look forward to our meeting at the Summit.”

The Canada-based World Sikh Organization (WSO) condemned Mr. Carney's decision to invite Mr. Modi to the G7 despite India's alleged role in the death of Mr. Nijjar. 

“For Sikhs in Canada, this is a betrayal, not just of our community, but of core Canadian values,” WSO President Danish Singh said in a statement. “Prime Minister Carney's decision to invite Narendra Modi, while India continues to deny any role in the assassination of Bhai Hardeep Singh Nijjar and refuses to cooperate with Canadian authorities, is both shameful and dangerous.”

“We would never welcome leaders from Russia, China, or Iran under such circumstances. Yet India has done far more on Canadian soil in terms of foreign interference and transnational repression, including orchestrating murders, and is being rewarded with a red carpet welcome.”

Canada-India relations will be repaired ‘one step at a time': Anita Anand

Last week, Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand said Canada looks forward to rebuilding ties with India as part of an effort to diversify trade away from the United States – even as the RCMP investigation into Mr. Nijjar's murder continues.

The Carney government, which also talked of repairing ties with China Thursday, is strengthening overseas relations as ties with the United States erode under U.S. President Donald Trump.

Ms. Anand last week said the renewal of ties with India will take place “one step at a time.” 

“As I mentioned, the rule of law will never be compromised, and there is an ongoing investigation regarding the case that you mentioned,” she said in an interview, referring to Mr. Nijjar's murder. “At the same time, we are looking forward to continuing to build this partnership, and we're looking forward to that as a government – it's not just me.”

“It's part of the process of diversifying our relationships and building relationships around the world.”

Mr. Carney won April's federal election after campaigning on a plan to reduce the country's dependency on the United States, which he painted as increasingly unreliable.

Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada, welcomed Mr. Modi's inclusion at the G7 leaders' summit.

He said there is a clear opportunity ahead for Canada and India to reset their relationship and determine next steps in the coming months. 

“On the global front, it's important that democracies work in concert at a challenging and uncertain time like this,” Mr. Hyder said.

A new Leger poll released on Thursday shows Canadian travel to the U.S., including cities such as New York, is down considerably.Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters

For years, the plan was New York. A long weekend, an old friend, her milestone birthday. But in this tumultuous spring of 2025, New York was not an option. 

We swapped out Broadway for an Ontario road trip to Prince Edward County; the only Big Apple these Canadians were going to get anywhere near was Colborne's roadside attraction along the 401.

A version of this is being repeated across the country in this annus horribilis for Canadian-U.S. relations, with more tales of travel switch-outs emerging as the summer season begins. Our elbows might be getting a bit sore by now, but our patriotism game is strong.

Canadians did not have a say in the U.S. election that has played havoc with the economy and brought threats to our sovereignty. Nor do we have a voice in the undemocratic horror show we are witnessing: immigration roundups, sweeping travel bans. 

But we can vote with our travel itineraries. And we are.

Canadians go elbows up on U.S. travel, opting for these destinations instead

A new Leger poll released on Thursday shows Canadian travel to the U.S. “collapsing” with 71 per cent less likely to travel to the U.S. in 2025 compared to last year. And 75 per cent of Canadians who were planning a trip to the U.S. say the tariff announcements have influenced their travel plans. Meanwhile, the Conference Board of Canada found 27 per cent of Canadian respondents are considering a trip to the U.S. in the next few years, down from more than 50 per cent in the same survey last year. 

Travel to the U.S. was down in April, with a drop of more than 35 per cent in Canadian residents returning over land borders from the year before. By air, the drop was nearly 20 per cent. 

This could mean as much as $8.8-billion in extra business for Canadian domestic tourism, according to the Conference Board of Canada. 

But this travel war has casualties, such as businesses that rely on travel to the U.S. As someone who hears often from publicists (occupational hazard), I started to feel for people whose jobs it is to sell U.S. destinations to Canadians. Imagine having to do that right now. 

They're trying to lure us back. For example, the Canadian firm representing Visit Detroit pitched a Mother's Day “stylish weekend” trip. Tone deaf or desperate? Or maybe – on brand – naively hopeful? Because the chances of Canada's national newspaper – which has taken on the grassroots Elbows Up campaign in a big way – suggesting you take mom over the border to celebrate her special day were approximately nil. 

Travellers change plans to avoid intense U.S. border checks as Canadian airlines rethink routes

Publicists tell me, though, that while they are not getting much (or any) uptake on these pitches, their objectives include keeping their destinations on Canadian travellers' radars. 

This crisis has been a recurring theme this week in Saskatoon, at the Travel Media Association of Canada Conference, event chair Tania Kedikian tells me. 

Ms. Kedikian is senior account director at Development Counsellors International (“The Leader in Marketing Places”) and she oversees DCI's marketing strategy for all U.S. clients that are interested in the Canadian market. (Say a prayer for her.)

“Some journalists have told us candidly: they're hesitant to promote U.S. travel right now,” she told me.

But, with her rose-coloured sunnies firmly on, she says she believes this is not a flat-out rejection of the U.S. For instance, she sees event-driven travel emerging strongly; trips to the U.S. tied to a specific event – the Boston Marathon, a Beyonce concert. “In those cases, opportunity is trumping all,” she wrote to me, employing an, er, interesting choice of words. 

Opinion: If Canadians have to ride the tariff rollercoaster, we can at least boycott U.S. travel

Sorry, but this Canadian is not buying it. I can't be the only one who has cancelled event-driven travel (the FIFA Club World Cup this summer – sob). And when FIFA's main event, the World Cup, comes to North America next year, how will all of this affect games played in the U.S.?

There are more severe victims of the Donald Trump administration than Canadian publicists and PR firms, obviously. But you've got to feel for them.

An even greater concern is for Canadian destinations that may experience a drop in U.S. tourism. A video released this week featuring local leaders in Northern Ontario's Lake Superior region suggests a slight air of desperation. “I'd like to send out a big smalltown welcome to our American friends,” says Kevin Mullins, mayor of the township of Schreiber. “I'd like you to know we're open for business.”

Prince Edward County was lovely, if a little pricey. My friend and I got our celebratory weekend and we didn't have to deal with a hostile exchange rate or shakedown at the border.

But here was the best part: I allowed myself, no prescribed myself, a break from anything involving He Who Is Ruining Everything. It was a most excellent getaway.

Russia is prepared to offer political asylum to tech billionaire Elon Musk following his public feud with U.S. President Donald Trump, Dmitry Novikov, deputy chair of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, said June 6.

"I think Musk is playing a completely different game, that he won't need political asylum, although if he did, Russia could certainly provide it," Novikov told the state-run news agency TASS.

The remarks came days after Musk's 130-day stint as head of a temporary federal commission ended on May 30, and amid deepening tensions between the Tesla CEO and Trump. 

The feud began when Musk publicly criticized the administration's "Big Beautiful Bill," a sweeping tax proposal that economists warn could expand the U.S. deficit by $600 billion.

Trump responded by personally attacking Musk during his meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on June 5. In his Truth Social post, Trump said that Musk "just went crazy."

Musk replied on social media that Trump owed his electoral victory to him, claiming that without his influence, Democrats would have maintained control of the House.

Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council and a frequent purveyor of anti-Western rhetoric, joked on X that Moscow would broker peace between "D and E" — referring to Trump and Musk — in exchange for Starlink shares. 

"Don't fight, guys," Medvedev wrote.

Musk was a key figure in Trump's campaign and early administration. As head of the government efficiency task force, he led efforts to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which has provided over $37 billion in aid to Ukraine.

Despite initially supporting Ukraine and providing Starlink satellite systems to bolster military communications, Musk has increasingly echoed Russian narratives. 

The billionaire has falsely claimed that President Volodymyr Zelensky has little support in Ukraine and accused Kyiv of waging a "never-ending draft meat grinder."

He has also lobbied against U.S. military assistance to Ukraine, arguing it only prolongs the war — a line frequently used by Kremlin officials to discourage Western backing for Kyiv.

Musk's comments have earned praise from Russian officials and propagandists, including state TV hosts and military bloggers who now view the billionaire as a sympathetic figure.

            A sweeping new travel ban on citizens from a dozen nations was announced by the White House on Wednesday, reviving a defining effort from the first Trump administration to crack down on entries from specific countries. 



            Trump said in a video posted Wednesday that new countries could be added to the travel ban as “threats emerge around the world.”
    


            The 12 countries targeted – plus seven more, which face partial restrictions – are mostly nations with frosty, adversarial or outwardly antagonistic relations with Washington. Many are either failed states or in the throes of repressive rule, and some are governed by groups that took control after years of US involvement in their affairs.
    


            “Frankly, we want to keep bad people out of our country,” Trump said Thursday. “The Biden administration allowed some horrendous people, and we're getting them out one by one, we're not stopping until we get them out.”
    


            For all but four of the 19 countries hit with restrictions, the administration pointed to high rates of their nationals overstaying their visas after entering the US.
    


            Visa overstays have received renewed scrutiny since the Boulder, Colorado, attack last weekend against a group campaigning in solidarity with the Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The suspect in that attack was originally from Egypt, which was not on Wednesday's travel ban list. He obtained a two-year work authorization that expired in March, a Homeland Security (DHS) official said.
    


            Seven countries were included because the administration deemed they pose a “high level of risk” to the US: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.
    


            The travel ban does not target existing visa or green card holders, and it also features carve-outs for some visa categories and for people whose entry serves US interests.
    


            Its impact will vary greatly from country to country; some nations only receive a few hundred nonimmigrant visas per year, while others have seen hundreds of thousands of people enter the US in the past decade.
    


            Travel to the US has been fully restricted for citizens from Chad, Sudan, Libya, Eritrea, the Republic of Congo, Somalia and Equatorial Guinea. Meanwhile, a partial restriction has been imposed on nationals from Burundi, Togo and Sierra Leone.
    


            The US does not issue a high number of visas to most of those countries – according to State Department data, only a few hundred or a few thousand people from each were granted immigrant and nonimmigrant visas in 2023.
    


            The White House said Somalia had been identified as a “terrorist safe haven,” led by a government that lacks “command and control of its territory.” This year, the US carried out airstrikes in Somalia against ISIS and affiliated targets, in a joint counterterrorism effort with the nation.

            Relations with Sudan have soured; last month, the Trump administration said it would impose sanctions on the military-led Sudanese government after finding that it used chemical weapons last year during its ongoing war with a rival military faction. The US has been unable to broker a ceasefire to end the conflict that has raged on for two years, leaving tens of thousands dead.
    


            The White House has also had a frosty relationship with Chad, which demanded the removal of American troops from its territory last year, as well as with Eritrea, whose military the Biden administration accused in 2023 of committing war crimes during a conflict in northern Ethiopia.
    


            Similar reprimands have been made by the US State Department against state and non-state actors in Libya, which it accused of committing crimes against humanity.
    


            Chad had one of the highest rates of visa overstays of any country included in the ban; around half of the people admitted to the US from the central African nation overstayed their visa in the 2023 financial year, according to the DHS, though the numbers of Chadians granted such visas was relatively small. The White House said Wednesday that Chad's overstay rate is “unacceptable and indicates a blatant disregard for U.S. immigration laws.”
    


            The President of Chad, Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno, said on Facebook that he had told his government to “act in accordance with the principles of reciprocity” by suspending visas to citizens of the United States.
    


            “Chad has no planes to offer, no billions of dollars to give but Chad has his dignity and pride,” he added.
    


            The African Union Commission said in a Thursday statement it was “concerned” about the impact of bans “on people-to-people ties, educational exchange, commercial engagement, and the broader diplomatic relations that have been carefully nurtured over decades.”
    


            “While recognising the sovereign right of all nations to protect their borders and ensure the security of their citizens, the African Union Commission respectfully appeals to the United States to exercise this right in a manner that is balanced, evidence-based, and reflective of the long-standing partnership between the United States and Africa,” its statement read.
    


            The ban targeted three Middle Eastern adversaries with which the US has limited or no diplomatic ties.
    


            The US does not formally recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan's official government. The militant group reclaimed power in 2021 amid a chaotic and deadly withdrawal of US forces under the Biden administration. Afghans who helped the US government during Washington's two-decade involvement in the country are exempt from the ban; they fall under a Special Immigrant Visa program that has allocated more than 50,000 visas since 2009.
    


            The Trump administration targeted Yemen's Houthi rebels with airstrikes for several weeks earlier this year, in response to the group attacking ships and disrupting trade routes in the Red Sea. The Houthis control much of western Yemen, including the capital Sanaa.
    


            Haiti has been in the grips of violent unrest for years. Gangs control at least 85% of its capital, Port-au-Prince, and have launched attacks in the country's central region in recent years. The violence has left more than one million Haitians internally displaced.
    


            Two other Latin American nations – Cuba and Venezuela – also face restrictions, though Trump stopped short of implementing a full ban. The move comes a week after the Supreme Court allowed Trump's administration to suspend a Biden-era humanitarian parole program that let half a million people from the two countries, plus Nicaragua, temporarily live and work in the US each year.
    


            Trump in March revoked temporary humanitarian parole for about 300,000 Cubans, amid a record number of arrivals of migrants from the Caribbean island. On Thursday, Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla said the ban “has racist undertones” and “damages personal, professional, academic, and cultural exchanges between the two countries.”
    


            Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yván Gil Pinto called the travel ban issued against Venezuelan nationals an “operation of hate and stigmatization,” in a statement released Thursday.
    


            Of all the countries targeted, the new restrictions may impact Venezuelans the most. More than 55,000 people from Venezuela received nonimmigrant visas to enter the US in 2023, and nearly 800,000 Venezuelans in total were granted such visas over the preceding decade, according to the State Department.
    


            The White House said both Laos and Myanmar, also known as Burma, have failed to co-operate with the US regarding the return of their nationals.

Myanmar's earthquake devastated the war-torn nation. For its reviled military leaders, it has brought opportunity



            Myanmar's ruling military junta has spent the past four years waging a brutal civil war across the Southeast Asian country, sending columns of troops on bloody rampages, torching and bombing villages, massacring residents, jailing opponents and forcing young men and women to join the army.
    


            The junta is headed by a widely reviled army chief who overthrew the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi and installed himself as leader, and the nation was thrown into further turmoil by a devastating earthquake in March.
    


            The US and Laos meanwhile have a complicated history, hampered by the US bombing of the country during its war in Vietnam. But relations have improved dramatically this century, and the US-Laos partnership is one of the most stable and productive of all 19 countries targeted by Wednesday's ban.
    


            Egypt was spared inclusion in the travel ban, even though the restrictions were expedited after an Egyptian national was charged with attempted murder after the Molotov cocktail attack in Boulder, Colorado.
    


            Egypt has long been a key US partner in the Middle East. Relations between Cairo and Washington date back to 1922, when Egypt gained independence from the United Kingdom, and have continued ever since.
    


            According to the US embassy in Egypt, some 450 Egyptians travel to the United States annually on professional and academic exchange programs.
    


            Trump told reporters Thursday that “Egypt has been a country that we deal with very closely. They have things under control. The countries that we have don't have things under control.”
    


            The Arab nation has also historically been the second biggest recipient of US military aid, following Israel. Since 1978, the US has contributed more than $50 billion in military assistance to Egypt, according to the American embassy, though some of this aid has been occasionally withheld on account of the country's human rights record.

An immigration judge has granted bond to an 18-year-old Massachusetts high school student who was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents on May 31.

Marcelo Gomes da Silva, a junior at Milford Public High School in Massachusetts, was released from ICE custody on Thursday after Judge Jenny Beverly set his bond at $2,000.

            A young Tibetan controversially appointed by China's atheist Communist Party as the second-highest spiritual leader in Tibetan Buddhism has pledged to make the religion more Chinese.
    


            Gyaltsen Norbu was installed by Beijing as the 11th Panchen Lama in 1995 in defiance of the religion's highest authority the Dalai Lama, whose pick for the role — a six-year-old boy — has since vanished from public view. China has yet to reveal any information on the whereabouts of the missing boy.
    


            The Beijing-appointed Panchen Lama is dismissed as an imposter by many Tibetans at home and in exile, but he is often quoted in China's state-run media toeing the Communist Party's line and praising its policies in Tibet.
    


            In a rare meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing on Friday, Gyaltsen Norbu vowed to make his own contributions to promoting ethnic unity and systematically advancing “the sinicization of religion,” state news agency Xinhua reported.
    


            The remarks refer to a sweeping campaign unleashed by Xi with an aim to purge religious faiths of foreign influence and align them more closely with traditional Chinese culture – and the authoritarian rule of the officially atheist Communist Party.
    


            Gyaltsen Norbu also vowed to keep Xi's teachings firmly in mind, resolutely support the party's leadership and firmly safeguard national unity and ethnic solidarity, according to Xinhua.
    


            He was told by Xi to carry forward the “patriotic and religious traditions” of Tibetan Buddhism and contribute to fostering “a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation,” Xinhua reported.
    


            The meeting comes on the 30th year of the disappearance of the Dalai Lama appointed Panchen Lama.
    


            Following the 1989 death of the 10th Panchen Lama, the second most important figure in Tibetan Buddhism, the Dalai Lama named Tibetan child Gedhun Choekyi Nyima as his colleague's reincarnation.
    


            But three days after he was chosen, according to the US government, Gedhun and his family were disappeared by the Communist Party, which then appointed an alternative Panchen Lama. Gedhun hasn't been seen in public since.



            In a statement marking that anniversary, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio denounced Chinese authorities for “abducting” him and his family. He called on Beijing to immediately release Gedhun Choekyi Nyima and “stop persecuting Tibetans for their religious beliefs.”
    


            In 2020, the Chinese government publicly acknowledged the fate of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima for the first time, describing him as “a college graduate with a job,” and that neither he nor his family wished to be disturbed in their “current normal lives.”
    


            Meanwhile, Gyaltsen Norbu has occupied an increasingly high-profile role since becoming an adult, joining a top Chinese political body, often appearing at important events in Beijing and meeting large crowds in the Tibetan regions of China.

            The contested appointment of the Panchen Lama is widely seen by experts and the Tibetan exile community as Beijing's attempt to pave the way for the passing – and reincarnation – of the Dalai Lama, who has lived in exile since fleeing to India following a failed Tibetan uprising against Communist Party rule in 1959.
    


            For decades, the Dalai Lama has been a persistent thorn in Beijing's side as he commanded the loyalty of many Tibetan people from exile and kept their struggle for greater autonomy alive on the world stage. Chinese officials have condemned the Nobel Peace Prize laureate as a “separatist” and a “wolf in monk's robes.”
    


            The Dalai Lama has said he will release details about his succession around his 90th birthday in July. In his latest book, “Voice for the Voiceless,” the Dalai Lama said his successor will be born in the “free world,” which he described as outside China.
    


            Beijing has insisted it will choose his successor – as well as the reincarnation of all Tibetan Buddhist lamas, but the Dalai Lama and his supporters have said that any successor named by China would not be respected.

            When friends Neon and Zane started a campaign to stop Tesla from building a battery recycling factory on a small block in their local area, they suspected that strong views about the company's billionaire boss might help sway local opinion.
    


            But they had no idea how much, or how far, anti-Elon Musk sentiment had spread beyond the epicenter of his influence in the United States, where until recently he caused chaos in federal workplaces as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency.
    


            Neon and Zane, who asked to use aliases to avoid doxxing by Musk supporters, say the main aim of their campaign, “Trees Not Teslas,” was to preserve about 60 trees on the site, in Tonsley, an area south of Adelaide, Australia's driest state capital.
    


            “We're struggling for designated green spaces … and it's just an insult to try and take away the one bit that's left within the Tonsley area,” said Neon, who used to live near the site and still works in the vicinity.
    


            When the local council published the results of its community consultation on the proposal, which allows the land to be sold for redevelopment, it contained hundreds of inflammatory anti-Musk comments or outright slurs. A search showed 229 references to “Nazi,” “Nazism” or other, similar phrases, to give an indication of the tone.
    


            With his high profile, confrontational statements and postings on social media, Musk has become a lightning rod for people across America and around the world opposed to the policies of US President Donald Trump's administration.
    


            The Tesla CEO is now engaged in a very public bust-up with Trump, that's unfolding in real-time on rival social media platforms, watched by a global audience.
    


            Musk's former close partnership with Trump took a toll on Tesla sales. Global deliveries plunged 13% in the first three months of this year, the largest drop in its history, as backlash against Musk and growing competition took a bite out of demand for its vehicles.
    


            Of the proposed factory in Tonsley, a suburb managed by the Marion Council, one comment from the public consultation said: “You and I both know it's getting torched every few months because of the Nazi implications. You really want that bought (sic) up every single meeting?”
    


            Some respondents referred directly to the arm gesture Musk gave in January at Trump's post-inauguration rally that commentators likened to a fascist salute. At the time, Musk wrote on his social media platform X: “The ‘everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired.”
    


            But the memory appeared to stick with Tonsley residents and a staggering 95% of over 900 replies to the council survey rejected its plans to prepare the land for sale. However, Marion Council passed it anyway and sent it to the state government for approval.
    


            CNN has reached out to Tesla for comment.
    


            It may seem unusual that residents in a small Australian city might have issues with Musk, given their distance from his policies and decisions. And it's especially unusual given South Australia's past positive experience with the billionaire entrepreneur.
    


            In 2017, Musk offered to build the world's most powerful battery to solve some of the state's power woes within 100 days, or it would be free. And he did. South Australia is now leading the country in terms of renewable energy and is on track to hit its target of 100% net renewables by 2027.
    


            Backed by the state government, Tesla and a local power company have created a virtual power plant fitting Powerwall battery systems on homes across the state. The idea is that all the batteries would band together to support the grid in times of high demand.
    


            However, the proposed Tesla plant in Marion would not generate any power – it would be used to recycle Tesla batteries and provide a showroom for Tesla's electric vehicles (EV), sales of which have fallen in Australia.
    


            Figures from the Electric Vehicle Council show Tesla sales nationwide nearly halved in the year to May 2025. Felipe Munoz, senior analyst at auto market research firm JATO Dynamics, says that's partly due to the wait for the Model Y. It finally arrived in Australia in May, sending Tesla sales soaring 122% last month compared with the same period a year ago.
    


            Marion Council Mayor Kris Hanna says anti-Musk sentiment had intruded on a standard council consultation, which was simply about finding a use for contaminated land “that will probably never be a recreational space again.”
    


            The site is contaminated by trichloroethylene, known as TCE, a solvent that can cause cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma and is banned in the United States.
    


            “The problem with that is, not only, for example, children playing in the dirt, but also the fumes which can rise up from underneath the earth. Sealing it with a bitumen car park or a building is a solution,” said Hanna.
    


            The site has been fenced off from the public since 2016. The locals say that, even if they can't use it, the mature trees offer a refuge for birdlife in an area almost devoid of tree canopy. More importantly, according to the Conservation Council of South Australia, the mature trees are helping to contain the contamination.
    


            “The removal of trees puts that site at greater risk of the leakage of those contaminants into the groundwater and obviously then impacting on human health more broadly,” said Kirsty Bevan, the group's CEO, who added Tesla's promises to plant 59 saplings on the site weren't good enough.
    


            “We are proposing that further research needs to be undertaken at that site, and remedial measures need to be put in place,” she said. “I think that the site improvements we're looking for would come with a forest of trees.”
    


            Of the anti-Musk campaign, Bevan said: “I don't let my personal opinions of people I've never met before interfere with being a voice for nature.”
    


            Hanna, the mayor, said councilors heard the opposition but voted 8-3 to pass the proposal because it would create 100 jobs, a “huge number” for the area. A new business would also pay local taxes, easing the burden on residents during a cost-of-living crisis, Hanna said.
    


            “To have a substantial new factory come into the area is very significant, and it's adjacent to a high-tech manufacturing area, which we developed in the place of an old car plant. So, it actually fits in very well to have a factory that recycles electric batteries,” Hanna said.
    


            One of the dissenting councilors, Sarah Luscombe, said she voted against the proposal because the community had sent clear and consistent feedback that they wanted more trees, and the council's own strategic vision is for a “livable, sustainable community.”
    


            “The people that I've spoken to in the community are just sick and tired of seeing their interests overshadowed by those of large corporations,” Luscombe said. “More and more, we're seeing communities just saying, ‘Well, hang on, I do want to have a say here, and I do want my views to be counted.'”
    


            In recent months, Tesla cars and showrooms have been vandalized in multiple countries by critics venting their anger over Musk's support of far-right parties in Europe, and other policies.
    


            Hanna said the council had received “vitriolic correspondence” since approving the proposal, but he wasn't concerned about a violent backlash against the Tesla factory or council members and wouldn't be drawn on his own views on Musk.
    


            “I'm speaking as a mayor, and I don't actually take any political or ideological stance,” he said. “I just try and make life beautiful for the people in my area.”
    


            South Australian Local Government Minister Joe Szakacs told CNN in a statement that he will follow the “usual process” to determine if the land should be approved for sale.
    


            “Our Government welcomes investment and job creation in South Australia and is proud of its commitment to deliver 100 per cent net renewables by 2027,” he said.
    


            Any sale would require the land's owner to submit a development application and decontaminate the site to the standards set by state authorities.
    


            South Australia's Environment Protection Authority said it's held preliminary talks with the council and the developer. Addressing legacy contamination is often complex, costly and time-consuming, it added.
    


            Neon and Zane organized a snap rally outside the Marion Council building on Wednesday calling for the state government to reject the re-zoning application. More than a dozen protesters held signs, including one that said, “Elon Musk can get [redacted].”
    


            They're determined to keep Tesla out of their area and are unmoved by the promise of more jobs. “They're going to be jobs on contaminated land in a company that's contaminated by Elon Musk,” said Neon.
    


            “Ninety-nine out of the 117 pages in their report were negative comments about Elon and the proposal. How can you ignore that? And if you do, you're not representing the people, you're just being bought by business.”

Ukrainian forces struck multiple Russian airfields and military facilities overnight on June 6, hours before Russia launched one of its heaviest aerial assaults of the war, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported.

Ukrainian strikes reportedly targeted Engels and Dyagilevo airfields — two key hubs for Russia's long-range bomber fleet, as well as logistics sites in Russia's Kursk Oblast.

Hours after the strikes, Russia attacked Ukraine with 452 drones and 45 missiles, killing at least five people and injuring 73 in one of the largest attacks of the full-scale war.

Engels-2 air base, located in Saratov Oblast, nearly 600 kilometers (370 miles) from Ukraine's front lines, hosts Russia's Tu-95, Tu-22M3, and Tu-160 bombers — aircraft regularly used in missile attacks on Ukrainian cities. 

Ukraine's General Staff said a strike ignited large fires at the facility, hitting at least three fuel tanks. Footage and local reports confirmed a significant blaze and numerous explosions in the area.

Saratov Governor Roman Busargin acknowledged a fire at an unspecified "industrial enterprise" and damage from drones to a residential building. No casualties were reported.

The Dyagilevo airfield in Ryazan Oblast, home to air refueling tankers and bomber escort fighters, was also targeted. The General Staff reported fire damage in the area, with Russian air defense activity and explosions recorded. Results of the strike are still being assessed.

Ukraine also claims to have struck a logistics center tied to the 30th Motorized Rifle Regiment of Russia's 72nd Division near Kulbaki in Kursk Oblast.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed that 174 Ukrainian drones were intercepted overnight across 12 regions of Russia and occupied Crimea. 

"Strikes on military infrastructure will continue until the Russian Federation's armed aggression against Ukraine is completely stopped," Ukraine's General Staff said.

The latest wave of Ukrainian strikes underscores Kyiv's evolving long-range strike capability, as well as its efforts to preemptively degrade Russian assets used in air assaults. 

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on June 1 launched Operation Spiderweb, a daring mass drone attack that damaged 41 Russian heavy bombers at four key airfields throughout the country. 

The operation reportedly targeted A-50, Tu-95, and Tu-22 M3 planes parked at the Belaya, Diaghilev, Olenya, and Ivanovo air bases, causing approximately $7 billion in damage.

Tohoku University will hire about 500 world-class researchers by fiscal 2029, it was learned on Thursday.

Tohoku University is the only university recognized by the Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Ministry as a University for International Research Excellence, or a university that aims to achieve the world's highest level of research abilities. The university will use ¥30 billion in government subsidies to hire the researchers.

Over the next 25 years, the university hopes to increase its ratio of foreign researchers from 12% to 30%. This fiscal year, it plans to use ¥2.2 billion of the ¥15.4 billion in grants it has received as a university of excellence to hire about 100 people. Currently, it is negotiating with 11 overseas researchers whose annual salaries exceed ¥20 million.

The Trump administration's cuts to science and technology budgets have presented a chance to snag researchers who are struggling to continue their research in the United States. And while there is a large gap in salaries between Japan and the United States, the university will pay according to performance and will not set salary caps.

“We hope to attract excellent researchers from all over the world to enhance our research capabilities,” said a university source.

MOSCOW, June 6. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump administration's steps toward building the Golden Dome missile shield are turning space into an arena of armed confrontation, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said in an interview with TASS.

"Steps taken by the Trump administration to develop the US ‘Golden Dome for America' missile defense system, which provides for a significant strengthening of the arsenal of tools to conduct military operations in space, including the deployment of interception systems in orbit, is a direct path not only to the militarization of outer space, but also to its transformation into an arena of armed confrontation," Ryabkov said.

Russia's senior diplomat stressed that such US actions provoke escalation of tensions and an arms race in space paves the way for mutual distrust as well as for serious obstacles to cooperation on inter-state level regarding the peaceful exploration of space.

"All of this is fraught with the most serious negative consequences for international security," Ryabkov continued.

"In order to counter Washington's steps to deploy weapons in outer space, together with our satellite countries, we exert efforts aimed at the early start of negotiations on the development of an international legally binding tool that prevents an arms race in outer space, abbreviated as the Prevention of Arms Race in Space [PAROS], prohibiting the deployment of any type of weapon in outer space, the use of force or threats of force against space objects or with their help," the high-ranking diplomat noted.

On May 20, US President Donald Trump announced his country's strategy regarding how its Golden Dome missile defense shield project would move forward. The administration plans to allocate approximately $175 billion for the project. According to Trump, construction will take a little under three years.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. 

An oil refinery in the city of Engels in Russia's Saratov Oblast was engulfed in flames after an overnight Ukrainian drone attack on June 6, Russian officials and media outlets reported. 

Ukraine has previously targeted the Kristal Plant, an oil refinery in Engels that supplies fuel to Russia's Engels-2 military airfield. The airfield is one of the country's key strategic military bases. It hosts long-range bombers, including the nuclear-capable Tu-95 and Tu-160 aircraft. 

Residents shared footage of major fires breaking out in Engels following a drone attack, according to the independent Russian Telegram news channel Astra. Locals reported that the refinery was under attack and that a residential building had been hit. 

The Saratov airport imposed restrictions due to the drone threat, according to Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya). 

Saratov Oblast Governor Roman Busargin claimed that a fire had broken out at an unspecified "industrial enterprise" and that emergency responders had been dispatched to the scene. He also said drones caused damage to a residential building. No casualties were reported.

The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that 174 Ukrainian drones were intercepted overnight, targeting 12 regions within Russia as well as Russian-occupied Crimea.

The Kyiv Independent could not confirm these claims. 

The reported drone attack comes after a series of major Ukrainian strikes against military targets inside Russia. 

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on June 1 launched Operation Spiderweb, a daring mass drone attack that damaged 41 Russian heavy bombers at four key airfields throughout the country. The operation reportedly targeted A-50, Tu-95, and Tu-22 M3 planes parked at the Belaya, Diaghilev, Olenya, and Ivanovo air bases, causing approximately $7 billion in damage. 

In the following days, Ukraine carried out strikes against Russia's Crimean Bridge, a military base in distant Vladivostok,  and a missile base in Bryansk Oblast.

Located in Russia's Saratov Oblast, around 600 kilometers (370 miles) from the front lines in Ukraine, the Engels-2 base has been a frequent target of Ukrainian strikes since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. The airfield houses three types of strategic bombers regularly used in missile attacks on Ukraine: the Tu-95, Tu-22, and Tu-160.

An attack against the air base on March 20 destroyed 96 air-launched cruise missiles, according to Ukraine's General Staff.

LONDON, June 6. /TASS/. Aggressive rhetoric against Russia coming from representatives of the British government is aimed at diverting the attention of the country's population from the accumulated social and economic problems, Russian Ambassador to London Andrey Kelin told Sky News in an interview.

"This story is as old as the world," Kelin noted. "When the government is not capable of dealing with internal economics and could not provide the population with normal conditions of life, then it tries to find an outside threat and concentrate on this threat."

On June 2, the British authorities published ‘The Strategic Defense Review 2025' document regarding national defense issues, which identified Russia as an ‘immediate and urgent threat' to London.

In view of the provided background, the British government confirmed that it would increase defense spending from the current 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 and will go for increasing this figure to 3% of GDP by 2034.

A Seattle man died after falling 3,000 feet from a climbing route at Denali National Park in Alaska, the National Park Service said Wednesday.

Alex Chiu, 41, was ascending the West Buttress route of Mount McKinley on Monday, June 2, one of the park's most frequently climbed routes, while not attached to a rope, the agency said in a statement. 

He was ski mountaineering, which involves ascending and descending the route with skis. He was joined by two others in his expedition to conquer North America's highest peak.

Two others witnessed his fall onto the rocky face covered in jagged ice, and lowered themselves over the edge as far as they could, but they could not see or hear him after the fall, officials said.

The mountaineers descended the route to ask for assistance at Camp 1, which is located around 7,800 feet up the mountain. 

Due to high winds and snow, ground and air search teams were unable to quickly reach the area where he had fallen on Monday. On Wednesday, clear weather allowed two rangers to depart Talkeetna, a village south of the mountain, in a helicopter search for Chiu.

When his body was found, it was transferred to the state medical examiner, the agency said. Fox News Digital has reached out to the Alaska State Medical Examiner's Office for Chiu's official cause of death.

Chiu was an aerospace engineer at the Federal Aviation Administration and, before that, a software engineer at Boeing, according to his LinkedIn profile. On his social media accounts, he described himself as a storyteller, traveler, scuba diver, rock climber, alpinist and marathon runner.

He wrote on his Instagram account about how living in Seattle allowed him to take his ice-climbing tools to the mountains every weekend. He shared that following the daily grind of his 9-to-5, he would pack up his gear and head to the mountains.

"I had become so good at what I did that I started teaching others how to do it, and that was even more fun to teach others how to experience the joy you have in these wild places," he wrote in an Instagram post. "When I am in the mountains, I realize I was at my best. I was smart, witty, passionate, and bold."

The pandemic put the brakes on his alpine climbs, but he dreamed of heading back to the climb.

"So tomorrow I am getting on an airplane to Alaska," he wrote in an Instagram post on May 19, "in an attempt to climb the third-highest peak in the world because I don't want to know what happens to a dream deferred."

The busiest season on the mountain lasts from mid-May to mid-June; there were about 500 climbers on it Wednesday, the agency said. Chiu is one of several people who have died while climbing Mount McKinley or other areas of Denali National Park.

In April 2024, 52-year-old Robbi Mecus, of Keene Valley, New York, fell to his death while climbing an estimated 1,000 feet off Mount Johnson in the national park. 

The NPS said that a similar accident happened in 2010, in a similar location. That incident involved an unroped French mountaineer, who fell to his death on the Peters Glacier. His body was never recovered.

            The National Hurricane Center is “fully staffed” and any suggestion that the Trump administration fired meteorologists at the National Weather Service is “fake news,” “preposterous and silly,” Commerce Sec. Howard Lutnick testified to Congress this week.
    


            But the administration did fire meteorologists, and the nation's top hurricane forecasting office is not fully staffed as the season is underway.
    


            The NHC, like many other parts of the NWS, has a staffing shortfall currently, with five vacancies at the center in Miami, including at least four meteorologists.
    


            None of the NHC positions can be filled due to the federal hiring freeze, though the NWS was able to get an exemption for 126 mission-critical vacancies at other forecast offices around the country.
    


            The critical staffing issues — which have meant some forecast offices are no longer monitoring the weather 24/7 or launching twice-daily weather balloons — have raised concerns that forecast accuracy will suffer during this hurricane season.
    


            “We are fully, fully staffed. There are no openings on the National Hurricane Center, zero. It is fully staffed,” Lutnick said before a Senate appropriations subcommittee during hearings on the Commerce Department budget on Wednesday.
    


            Lutnick claimed again on Thursday the NHC is “fully staffed,” and falsely stated local weather service forecast offices are fully staffed in an appearance before the House Appropriations Committee.
    


            “It is fake news and inappropriate to suggest a single meteorologist or hydrologist was fired,” Lutnick said. “That is preposterous and silly.”
    


            The Trump administration cut about 100 jobs at the NWS, including meteorologists and hydrologists, according to a fact sheet from Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell's office.
    


            The NWS lost even more meteorologists, including many with decades of experience, from early retirement and other incentives the Trump administration offered in order to reduce the size of the federal workforce.
    


            In total, the agency has lost about 560 employees during the course of the administration, bringing total staffing levels below 4,000, according to the NWS Employees Organization. This is about 18% below “necessary staffing levels” and 33% below “normal” staffing levels.
    


            Many local NWS offices are so short on meteorologists in the wake of Trump administration firings, buyouts and early retirement incentives that the agency has authorized internal transfers to fill critical gaps, in addition to the 126 new hires.
    


            The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reiterated Lutnick's claims in a Thursday statement: “The National Hurricane Center is fully staffed to meet the rigorous demands of the hurricane season,” spokesperson Kim Doster said. “Future positions that may be advertised at the NHC will provide additional support and a deeper bench for our ongoing around-the-clock operations.”
    


            A Commerce Department spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.
    


            The hurricane center's staff website shows all but one of its vacancies, which include at least one hurricane specialist, one hurricane forecaster and two meteorologist/programmers. One staff member who took an early retirement offer is still listed on the roster, according to an NWS employee familiar with the matter.

“Captain America doesn't wear a beard and a turban, and he's white.”

Vishavjit Singh looked at the boy who uttered those words, and then he looked at himself — a skinny, bespectacled, turbaned, bearded Sikh in a Captain America suit.

“I wasn't offended, because I knew that this kid was going to have this image of me, a Sikh Captain America, forever in his mind,” Singh said. “This image has so much power to it that it opens up conversations about what it means to be American.”

Representation of non-Abrahamic religions and spiritual traditions, particularly in the mainstream comics universe, is minimal. Even when they are portrayed in comics, their presentation, as Singh and others in the field point out, is often inauthentic and sometimes negative.

Recently, however, comic book writers and academics who study the intersection of religion and comics observe a renaissance of sorts, which they say is happening because people close to these faith traditions are telling these stories with a reverence and sincerity that resonate with a wider audience.




Singh's journey to make that connection began after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, triggered anti-Sikh hate incidents. Having faced hate and exclusion throughout his life, he decided to spread his message of kindness and inclusion by capitalizing on the appeal of comics and superheroes — an area where he found Sikh representation to be “virtually zero.”

He suited up as Captain Sikh America in Manhattan for the first time in summer 2013 — one year after a self-proclaimed white supremacist opened fire inside a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, killing six and injuring four others. 

New York's reaction to Captain Sikh America was joyous.

“Strangers came up and hugged me,” Singh said. “Police officers wanted photos with me. A couple wanted me to be part of their wedding ceremony. I felt I had a certain privilege I'd never had before.”

In 2016, Singh gave up his full-time job to travel around the country to schools, government agencies and corporations to share his story and educate youth about his culture and faith. He doesn't speak directly about religion but rather the core values of Sikhism.

“I talk about equality, justice and about the universal light being present in every speck of creation,” he said.

Marvel's Black Panther heralded better representation for Africana religions in the U.S., according to Yvonne Chireau, a professor of religion at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. However what is seen in Black Panther or other comics is a synthesis of different African religions and cultural practices, she said.

For example, one page might talk about the Orishas, divine spirits that play a key role in the Yoruba faith of West Africa, while another might feature Egyptian gods. One of the first superheroes with African religious roots, Chireau said, was Brother Voodoo, created in the 1970s by Marvel publisher Stan Lee, writer Len Wein and artist John Romita. He was the first Haitian superhero.

The turn of the last century was a time of revival for Black-centric comics, she said, adding that immigration from African and Caribbean countries, including Haiti, led to increased understanding of religious practices originating in those places.

“It's definitely gotten a lot better and much more authentic because the people who are telling these stories care about those religious practices,” she said.

Brooklyn-born Haitian American comic book writer Greg Anderson Elysée said he didn't learn about African and Caribbean religious traditions until he was a teenager. Elysée was raised Catholic, but he now considers himself agnostic. For the past decade, he's written comics about Is'nana, the son of Anansi the Spider, the god of wisdom, knowledge and mischief in the Akan religion of West Africa.

What drives his vision and his creativity, Elysée said, is the need to see more Black mythology, deities and spirituality showcased with the same level of respect as European fairy tales and Greek mythology.

“When I went looking for anything on African spirituality in the bookstore, I found it in the occult section as opposed to the religion or mythology section,” he said. Common depictions of African faith as voodoo and witchcraft are colonialist narratives aimed at demonizing Indigenous spiritual practices, he added.

“When I started going to ceremonies and rituals, I saw how much power there is in it. When we know who we are — whether you believe in the religion or not — it fills you with joy, a purpose and a sense of being.”

Elysée is excited and relieved by the reaction to his work.

“While this is entertainment, you also don't want to offend those who believe in it and truly get so much power from it,” he said. “Some of my portrayals of these religions in my comics may not be 100% authentic, but there is a level of research and respect that goes into every piece of it.”

Zen Buddhism has informed much of John Porcellino's work. For over three decades, he has produced and self-published King-Cat Comics and Stories, a largely autobiographical mini-comic series. Porcellino was drawn to Buddhism in his 20s after what he describes as a period of intense mental suffering and health problems.

As a punk rock fan, Porcellino saw commonalities between punk and Zen because “they are both concerned with the essence of things rather than appearances.” Both are ways of life — simple yet nuanced. 

He gave the example of a wordless story titled “October,” featured in King-Cat's 30th issue, that shows him as a high school student walking home one night from school. When he gets home, his mom asks him to take the dog outside; as he steps out, he sees the stars.

“It's the experience of being in everyday, mundane life ... and then suddenly breaking through to some kind of transcendence,” he said.

Porcellino views these comics as a healing presence in his life.

“They are an important part of my spiritual practice,” he said. “Any time I have a major crisis in my life, my first reaction is to sit down and start making comics and put my focus into that. It just helps ground me.”

Teresa Robeson, who wrote a graphic novel about the 14th Dalai Lama, said that even though her mother was Catholic and raised her in the faith, her grandmother was Buddhist. She grew up in Hong Kong, with memories of relatives praying to Buddhist gods, taking in the fragrance of burning incense and the sound of Buddhist chants.

Though she practices neither Catholicism nor Buddhism at this time, Robeson jumped at the opportunity to tell the story of the Dalai Lama in graphic novel form because the book focused on a pivotal moment in the spiritual leader's life, when he fled Tibet for India after the Chinese occupation.

Robeson liked the idea of representing a religion and culture that do not get much attention in media.

“Children's books are like mirrors and windows for kids,” she said. “It's helpful especially for children of immigrants who don't often see themselves in mainstream literature. They don't see anyone who looks like them or prays like them. At the same time, it also helps kids who are not Asian or Buddhist to learn something about those communities.” 

Amar Chitra Katha was a comic book company started by the late Anant Pai in Mumbai in 1967 as a way to teach Indian children about their own mythology and culture. The first title was “Krishna,” an important god in Hinduism and protagonist of the Bhagavad Gita, one of the religion's main sacred texts.

Pai was an engineer turned comic books seller who used varied marketing techniques, including walking around with planks, nails and hammers in his bag so he could build shelves for bookstores that refused to display his comics because they lacked shelf space, said Reena I. Puri, the company's managing director and a 35-year veteran of the business.

Pai started with Hindu mythology and gods but soon expanded to other faiths, releasing a globally successful comic titled “Jesus Christ” and others about Buddha, Sikh gurus and Mahavira, who founded Jainism. Later came secular comics about historical figures and folktales. 

But religion remains the mainstay of Amar Chitra Katha, and books that teach children about faith, history and culture are also the most popular in the diaspora, Puri said. 

“Most recently we've also portrayed (Indigenous) religions and have gathered folktales relating to these traditions from all over India,” she said.

Amar Chitra Katha comics faced criticism in the past for their portrayal of gods as fair-skinned and “asuras” — often the antagonists to the gods — as dark-skinned with demonic facial features. But that has changed, Puri said.

“We've educated ourselves and realized that our ancient texts were not as racist or colorist as we may be today,” she said. “We're correcting those misconceptions now.”

British comic book writer Mike Carey is known for his 2000-2006 DC Comics series “Lucifer,” which depicts the titular character's adventures on Earth, in Heaven and in various realms after abandoning Hell. Carey counts himself an atheist who went to Sunday school only “for the fun, stories and chocolate.”

Carey portrayed Lucifer as the “son of God, but as a rebellious disobedient son who wants to find himself as distinct from his father.” 

He has also explored pagan themes, particularly what he called the “weird interface between British folklore and British religious traditions.” 

Carey delved into the concepts of faith, God and morality in a series titled “My Faith in Frankie,” which tells the story of a teenager with a personal god called Jeriven who gets jealous of her boyfriend.

Even though many of his comics and novels explore religion and ethics, Carey said, he has never “felt any temptation whatsoever to believe.”

“I've become more and more entrenched in that position, because organized religions are like any organization that sustain themselves, amass power, wealth and authority,” he said. “So I've never really grappled with religious issues. What I do sometimes is explore, play with and tease out moral issues that were important and meaningful to me.”

            The most powerful alliance in US politics crumbled in real-time on Thursday, with President Donald Trump and Elon Musk lobbing political barbs and personal insults at each other from their respective social media platforms.
    


            The pair's biggest media allies at Fox News — the most-watched cable news network on the planet, often viewed as a clearinghouse for the MAGA agenda — seem to be having a little difficulty with the breakup.
    


            Since Thursday afternoon, the network's MAGA-aligned opinion personalities have largely mourned the feud and appeared torn between their two central heroes, at times openly imploring them through the TV screen to reconcile.
    


            Will Cain lamented that the feud is “not a story that we wanted today for America.”
    


            Greg Gutfeld demanded the pair “knock it off” and make up. Don't “sabotage” a Trump “Golden Age,” he said, “with this self-inflicted feud.”
    


            Longtime Trump ally and personal friend Laura Ingraham exhorted Musk, whom she called a modern-day Thomas Edison, to see that “Trump is not the problem here.” She confessed the situation “makes me sad,” and solemnly claimed she “talked to an insider today who said it is irreparable.”
    


            Other Fox News personalities seemed to deny the severity of the two most powerful figures in conservative politics publicly calling each other liars, losers and worse.
    


            “Big deal,” Sean Hannity said. “They'll work it out eventually, they'll become friends again.”
    


            “There is no split,” declared “Fox & Friends” co-host Lawrence Jones on Friday morning. “They're going to bury the hatchet.” He added: “You've got two strong alpha males that are deep in their convictions and it just exploded online.”
    


            Primetime host Jesse Watters suggested Trump and Musk were “just blowing off steam” and likened the situation to buddies in a love triangle: “Guys sometimes will punch you in the face, and the next night you're having beer; sleep with your girlfriend, and you patch things up.”
    


            “Fox & Friends” co-host Ainsley Earhardt made a similar analogy: “It's just like a relationship,” she said. “Everyone's been in a relationship where in the very beginning you're crazy about each other, you're talking marriage, you're talking about meeting the family, and then all of a sudden it takes a turn and you don't like each other anymore.”

            Surprisingly, the network hasn't shied away from repeating Musk's allegation that Trump is mentioned in the so-called Epstein files, long a subject of right-wing conspiracy theories.
    


            “If Trump was in them, Biden probably would have released them,” Watters asserted. Trump “was one of the first people to realize just how horrible Epstein really was,” Hannity offered in a defense.
    


            “The Epstein file thing was way over the top, and just crazy to say Trump was in the Epstein files,” Brian Kilmeade said Friday morning. “﻿What are you doing?” However, Kilmeade was careful to praise Musk's efforts during his time in the Trump administration.
    


            Notably, none of Fox's MAGA-aligned opinion stars explicitly chose a side, instead choosing to believe this is a mere blip in their big, beautiful friendship. It will be interesting to see where they fall should things get even uglier. The safe bet's on Trump, of course.

Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy breaks down the growing rift between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk as the two trade public jabs, including threats to cut government contracts.

FIRST ON FOX: The chairman of the House Budget Committee is pushing back on Elon Musk's claim that President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill" is full of "pork."

Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, told Fox News Digital it was not possible for "pork barrel spending" to be included in the legislation, called a budget reconciliation bill, because the reconciliation process was simply not the mechanism for such federal funds.

"Reconciliation does not have anything to do with discretionary spending - earmarks, and all of that," Arrington said. "And quite frankly, the [Department of Government Efficiency] findings were, I think, almost entirely an issue for . . . annual appropriations."

"Discretionary spending" refers to the annual dollars allocated by Congress each year through the appropriations process – also known as "spending bills."

It's a process that's historically known to be rife with "pork barrel spending" from both Republicans and Democrats – funding for pet projects or other specific initiatives benefiting a certain member of Congress' district.

But reconciliation deals with the government's "mandatory spending" – largely government welfare programs that can only be amended by changing the law.

"We're dealing with mandatory spending programs – entitlements, health care, welfare and the tax code," Arrington said. 

"We did a responsible bill. There's no pork in it. The question, I think, for some folks and the objective of mine and my budget committee members was, whatever we're doing on tax or security to unleash growth and to buy greater security for the American people, we wanted it to be done in a fiscally responsible way."

Senior White House adviser Stephen Miller echoed that sentiment on X: "The reconciliation bill cuts taxes, seals the border and reforms welfare. It is not a spending bill. There is no ‘pork.' It is the campaign agenda codified."

The vast majority of the trillions of dollars in the bill are aimed at Trump's tax policies – extending his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) while implementing new priorities like eliminating taxes on tips and overtime wages.

There's also $4 trillion in House Republicans' versions of the bill aimed at raising the debt limit.

The legislation is also aimed at amending current laws to enable new funding for border security and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) – projected to boost those priorities by billions of dollars.

To offset those costs, House GOP leaders are seeking stricter work requirements for Medicaid and food stamps, while shifting more of the cost burden for both programs to the states.

Republicans are also looking to roll back green energy tax subsidies in former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

But Musk and other fiscal hawks' main concern has been that the legislation does not go far enough with those spending cuts.

They've also raised concerns about the overall bill adding to the national debt – which is currently nearing $37 trillion.

As part of his social media campaign against the bill, Musk called for both eliminating the tax cuts and removing the debt limit increase from the final legislation.

Musk reposted another X user who wrote, "Drop the tax cuts, cut some pork, get the bill through."

He's also shown support on X for Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and his call to strip the debt limit provision out of the bill.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has projected that the bill would cut taxes by $3.7 trillion while raising deficits by $2.4 trillion over a decade.

            Lululemon's stock is on pace for one of its biggest routs in history after the athleisure maker warned that tariffs will dent its profit.
    


            The company cut its full-year guidance citing a “dynamic macroenvironment” that includes a decline in visits to its US stores, the impact of tariffs and and rising competition from other brands, such as Vuori and Alo.
    


            Lululemon (LULU) shares plunged more than 17% Friday, on pace for the stock's worst day in more than five years and its fourth-worst day ever.
    


            “The current tariff paradigm has brought uncertainty into the retail environment,” said CEO Calvin McDonald on a call with analysts Thursday, adding that Lululemon is “definitely not happy where the growth is in the US.”
    


            Following the likes of Nike, Roger Federer-backed On and other similiar brands, Lululemon will also implement “strategic price increases” on a “small portion” of its lineup that includes pricey yoga pants, shoes and shorts, Chief Financial Officer Meghan Frank revealed on the call, but said the price hikes “will be modest in nature.”
    


            The uncertainty around tariffs and consumer spending in the US forced Lululemon to cut its full-year earnings to be between $14.58 to $14.78 per share – a decrease from its previously forecasted $14.95 to $15.15.
    


            Despite that, McDonald said Lululemon is “better positioned than most” to endure and navigate the financial environment because it has $1.3 billion in cash and no debt, “which provides us significant financial flexibility,” he said.
    


            Lululemon is the latest company to reduce its guidance because of the at-least 30% tariffs on imports from China and 10% tariffs from other countries implemented by President Donald Trump.
    


Gap recently said it would could cost the company $100 million to $150 million this year. Sister brand Old Navy also recently launched a new, budget-friendly activewear line this month, that could further pressure Lululemon and attract budget-conscious customers.
    


            Lululemon stock is down about 11% for the year.

House Foreign Affairs Committee member Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., breaks down USAID's wasteful spending on 'America Reports.'

Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, said a thorough review of spending from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is warranted, following the Trump administration's efforts to overhaul the agency.  

USAID was an independent agency to provide impoverished countries aid and offer development assistance, but the agency was upended since February when President Donald Trump installed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to oversee the organization amid concerns that USAID did not advance U.S. core interests. Since then, the agency has faced layoffs and is being absorbed into the State Department. 

This increased scrutiny on USAID spending is valid, according to Risch. 

"The amount of money that we're spending on that has to be reviewed top to bottom," Risch said during an event Wednesday at the Washington-based think tank the Hudson Institute.

Risch said that several weeks into the Trump administration, he and others, including Rubio, evaluated a list of programs that detailed $3 million in funding for "promotion of democracy in Lower Slobovia." According to Risch, the description didn't provide enough information and items like these are totaling up to billions of dollars that must undergo review.

"Lower Slobovia" is a fictional place and a term used by Americans to describe an underdeveloped foreign country."We can do so much better, not only in how, how much money we spend, but how we spend it," Risch said. "So, if you say, well, we're eliminating this program, be careful you don't say, 'Oh, that means we're walking away from human rights.' Look, America is human rights. If America leads the way on human rights. We are the world standard on human rights. We have no intention of giving that position up."

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) targeted USAID in its push to eliminate wasteful spending. The agency came under fire for many funding choices, including allocating $1.5 million for a program that sought to "advance diversity, equity and inclusion in Serbia's workplaces and business communities" and a $70,000 program for a "DEI musical" in Ireland.

‘HYSTERIA': WHITE HOUSE SHUTS DOWN CONCERNS OVER USAID DOCUMENT PURGE

United States Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and James Risch, R-Idaho, attend the Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing for Marco Rubio to be Secretary of State on January 15, 2025.  

As a result, Rubio announced on March 11 that the State Department completed a six-week review and would cancel more than 80% of USAID programs — cutting roughly 5,200 of USAID's 6,200 programs.

Fox News Digital was the first to report later in March that the State Department planned to absorb the remaining operations and programs USAID runs so it would no longer function as an independent agency. 

The move means eliminating thousands of staff members in an attempt to enhance the existing, "life-saving" foreign assistance programs, according to a State Department memo that Fox News Digital obtained.

"Foreign assistance done right can advance our national interests, protect our borders, and strengthen our partnerships with key allies," Rubio said in a March statement to Fox News Digital. "Unfortunately, USAID strayed from its original mission long ago. As a result, the gains were too few and the costs were too high."

"We are reorienting our foreign assistance programs to align directly with what is best for the United States and our citizens," Rubio said. "We are continuing essential lifesaving programs and making strategic investments that strengthen our partners and our own country."

Meanwhile, Democrats slammed the restructuring of the agency, labeling the move "illegal." 

"Donald Trump and Elon Musk's destruction and dismantling of USAID is not only disastrous foreign policy and counter to our national security interests; it is plainly illegal," the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., said in a statement in March. "Congress wrote a law establishing USAID as an independent agency with its own appropriation, and only Congress can eliminate it."

            It's peak travel season, airports are packed and emotions are running high. You've probably seen it or even been part of it: that tense moment when a passenger snaps at a flight attendant, or a near-meltdown over a seat reclining too far. Why does flying seem to bring out the worst in us?
    


            Airplanes are, quite literally, a pressure cooker for emotions. For many, airports and airplanes are synonymous with anxiety, which often begins well before they step into the terminal.
    


            These environments combine stress, discomfort and a loss of control, often leaving even the calmest travelers feeling on edge.
    


            Planes also make inequalities bleedingly obvious. We've all experienced the envy of walking through first-class cabins to reach economy.
    


            It's easy to see why air rage has become so common. In fact, reported incidents have skyrocketed in recent years, exacerbated by pandemic-related anxieties.
    


            So, let's have a look at the science behind why we get so cranky when we fly. But more importantly, what we can do about it.
    


            In recent years, reports of unruly passenger behavior around the world have surged. Perhaps the most comprehensive indicator is the data compiled by the United States' Federal Aviation Administration, which shows a clear connection to the pandemic effect.
    


            In 2021, the administration recorded 5,973 incidents of unruly passenger behavior. This is a staggering 492% increase compared to the year before.
    


            To put this in perspective, the four-year average of such incidents for the period 2017–2020 was 901.75 (2017: 544, 2018: 889, 2019: 1,161, 2020: 1,009).
    


            While the numbers have decreased since their peak in 2021, they remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels.
    


            In 2022, the administration reported 2,455 incidents, followed by 2,076 in 2023, and 2,102 in 2024.
    


            These incidents in the US alone have led to 402 enforcement actions initiated in 2023, compared to a pre-pandemic high of 83 in a single year. Since 2021, fines totalling more than $21 million have been levied as a result of such incidents.
    


            The issue is not limited to the United States (although the US seems to have a higher share of such cases).
    


            The International Air Transport Association reported an increase in unruly passenger incidents globally, with one incident per 568 flights in 2022 — up from one per 835 flights in 2021.
    


            The most common types of incidents include non-compliance, verbally abusive behavior and intoxication. Notably, while non-compliance incidents initially fell after mask mandates were removed on most flights, the frequency began to rise again in 2022, ending the year 37% higher than in 2021.
    


            Examples of non-compliance include:

            Scholarly research has highlighted that the phenomenon arises from an interplay of stressors unique to aviation.
    


Environmental stressors



            Research consistently identifies the physical environment of airplanes as a significant contributor to passenger frustration and antisocial behavior.
    


            Factors such as cramped seating, limited personal space and high-density cabin configurations exacerbate discomfort and feelings of confinement.
    


            Psychological factors such as anxiety, claustrophobia and aviophobia (fear of flying) can also trigger an unusual behavior that the passenger may not show in other social contexts.
    


            In some studies, physical discomfort, such as encroachments into personal space, has been found the leading trigger for anger among passengers.
    


Emotional triggers such as frustration over delays, long lines at the security check or unmet service expectations, can escalate minor grievances into disruptive outbursts.
    


            Noise and hunger could further compound the situation. It can create a volatile atmosphere even before passengers acted out.
    


            Research has also suggested that low-cost carriers, while not directly responsible for air rage, create environments conducive to disruptive behavior due to reduced service levels, inadequate facilities and passenger stress from automation and cost-cutting measures.
    


Social stressors



            The role of inequality within the cabin environment is another potent factor.
    


            Research shows that airplanes serve as a microcosm of class-based society, with physical inequality (the presence of first-class cabins) and situational inequality (boarding through first-class sections) increasing the sense of frustration.
    


            Interestingly, situational inequality can even affect first-class passengers, by highlighting their privileges, sometimes fostering a sense of entitlement that may lead to antisocial behavior.
    


Alcohol use and nicotine withdrawal



            Alcohol is a dominant precipitant of air rage incidents. Some studies have found that more than half of reported air rage cases involved alcohol intoxication, often fuelled by liberal airport alcohol policies and in-flight consumption.
    


            Similarly, nicotine withdrawal was another factor, with nearly 9% of incidents attributed to smokers unable to satisfy their cravings during long flights.
    


Sociodemographic influences



            Empirical data suggest sociodemographic factors play a significant role in air rage incidents.
    


            One study examining 228 air rage cases found nearly 90% of incidents involved male passengers, with younger adults, particularly those aged 30–39, being the most frequently implicated.
    


            Cultural norms and expectations around air travel also influence behavior. They shape how passengers respond to delays, discomfort, breaches of etiquette or perceived inequities.

            In the UK, airlines and airport authorities have implemented measures, such as Edinburgh's “No Excuse for Abuse” campaign, to address the rise in disruptive behavior. Such initiatives remind passengers to treat staff and fellow travelers with respect, while emphasising a zero-tolerance approach to aggression.
    


            But tackling air rage requires more than just slogans.
    


            De-escalation techniques and early recognition of disruptive behavior can help diffuse situations before they escalate. Studies suggest experienced and well-trained crew members are better equipped to handle such incidents.
    


            There are also simple things you can do to improve the flying experience.
    


            Ultimately, it may be helpful to remember that air travel isn't always glamorous. Acknowledge that delays, discomfort and inconveniences are often part of the experience and accepting this reality can help reduce frustration.

HONG KONG (AP) — Prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong on Friday was charged with conspiracy to collude with foreign forces to endanger national security under a Beijing-imposed law that critics say has crushed Hong Kong's once-thriving pro-democracy movement.

The prosecution was the second time Wong has been charged under the sweeping national security law. He was already convicted in a separate subversion case linked to an unofficial primary election and was sentenced last year to four years and eight months in jail for that charge. 

The prosecution accused Wong, 28, of conspiring with fellow activist Nathan Law and others to ask foreign countries, institutions, organizations or individuals outside of China to impose sanctions or blockades, or engage in other hostile actions, against Hong Kong and China. 

They also said he disrupted the formulation and implementation of laws and policies by the Chinese and Hong Kong governments, and that the act was likely to have serious consequences. The alleged offenses occurred between July 2020 and November 2020.

The prosecution didn't elaborate on the accusations in court. The charge carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

After hearing the charge in court, Wong, who wore a blue shirt and was visibly thinner, said he “understood” the charge.

The case was adjourned to August.

National security police arrested Wong in Stanley prison on Friday on the new national security charge and also on suspicion of “dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offense,” police said in a statement. 




Wong rose to prominence in Hong Kong in 2012 as a high school student leading protests against the introduction of national education in the city's schools. Two years later, he became world famous as a leader of the Occupy Movement.

In 2016, Wong co-founded a political party named Demosisto with fellow young activists Law and Agnes Chow. In the 2019 pro-democracy movement, Wong helped seek overseas support for the protests. His activism led Beijing to label him an advocate of Hong Kong's independence who “begged for interference” by foreign forces.

Demosisto disbanded when Beijing imposed the security law in 2020. The Chinese and Hong Kong governments said the law brought back stability to the city. 

In 2023, Hong Kong authorities offered rewards of 1 million Hong Kong dollars ($127,600) for information leading to the arrests of Law, who moved to Britain, and several other overseas-based activists. 

Amnesty International's China Director Sarah Brooks said in a statement that the new prosecution against Wong showed the security law's “capacity to be used by Hong Kong authorities to threaten human rights in the city is as potent and present as ever.”

“This latest charge against him underscores the authorities' fear of prominent dissidents and shows the lengths they will go to keep them behind bars for as long as possible -- in so doing, continuing a chilling effect on civic activism in the city,” she said, urging the government to drop the charge and cease enforcing the law.

            Any reasonable American could objectively ask what exactly President Donald Trump's new travel ban, which affects a dozen countries, is about.
    


            Is it about protecting Americans from “murderers,” as Trump said Thursday, or punishing small countries for a modest number of students who overstayed their visas?
    


            The drive for Trump's first-term travel ban in 2017 and 2018 was clear.
    


            He was seeking to deliver on an ugly campaign promise to ban all Muslims from entering the US. That morphed, over the course of years as the administration adapted to court cases, into a ban on travel to the US by people from certain countries, most of which were majority-Muslim.
    


            It was only by agreeing to ignore Trump's anti-Muslim 2016 campaign statements and focus solely on the security-related language in his third attempt at a travel ban that the US Supreme Court ultimately gave its blessing to that ban.



            “… We must consider not only the statements of a particular President, but also the authority of the Presidency itself,” wrote Chief Justice John Roberts in the majority opinion.
    


            Trump is using that authority again in his second term.
    


            But this time, as he said Thursday in the Oval Office, the ban is about removing “horrendous” people who are in the country now and about keeping murderers out.
    


            The data suggest the travel ban will primarily affect students and businesspeople from countries in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean as well as the Middle East.
    


            It was an attack on Jewish community members in Colorado by an Egyptian national that convinced Trump to speed up plans to ban people from a dozen countries from entering the US, restarting the travel ban policy he pioneered during his first term.
    


            But Egypt is not on the travel ban list.
    


            Neither is Kuwait, the country where Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder attack, lived before coming to the US.
    


            “Egypt has been a country we deal with very closely. They have things under control,” Trump told reporters Thursday.
    


            Instead, the travel ban includes countries that Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who assembled the list, feel don't have things under control.
    


            That includes places like Equatorial Guinea in Africa and Burma, also known as Myanmar, in Asia. Neither is a nexus of terror threatening the American homeland.
    


            Trump's order announcing the travel ban explains that these countries have high rates of students and other travelers overstaying their visas in the US.
    


            It points to a report of DHS “overstay” data from 2023 to argue that for more than 70% of people from Equatorial Guinea with US student visas, there is no record of them leaving the US when their visa ended.
    


            In real numbers, that equals 233 people with student visas. The numbers are similarly small for other African countries.
    


            “They're just throwing things at the wall,” said David Bier, an immigration expert at the libertarian-leaning Cato institute and a Trump immigration policy critic.
    


            “There's not really a coherent philosophy behind any of this,” Bier added.
    


            The reinstated travel ban does include countries associated with terrorism, including Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, all of which were also included in Trump's first-term travel ban. But it's worth noting that no immigrant or traveler from one of these countries has launched a terror attack on the US in recent years, according to a review by the Washington Post during Trump's first term. A man from Sudan killed one person at a Tennessee church in 2017.
    


            “The president claims that there is no way to vet these nationals, yet that is exactly what his consular officers and border officials have successfully done for decades,” Bier said.
    


            The man responsible for the ISIS-inspired truck bomb in New Orleans in January, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, was a Texas-born Army veteran and US citizen.
    


            The new travel ban also includes Afghanistan, which could jeopardize many Afghans related to those who aided the US during its war there, as Shawn VanDiver, president of the aid organization #AfghanEvac, told CNN's Jim Sciutto on Thursday.
    


            “There are 12,000 people who have been separated through the actions of our government, who have been waiting for more than three and a half years,” he said.
    


            The Trump administration recently paused the processing of student visas, interrupting the plans of thousands of people to study in the US.
    


            In the Oval Office, Trump said he was not interested in banning students from China.
    


            “It's our honor to have them, frankly, we want to have foreign students, but we want them to be checked,” Trump said, suggesting there will be even more strenuous background checks in the future.
    


            The existence of the travel ban list could also factor into tariff negotiations the Trump administration has taken on with nations across the world, as well as its effort to countries nations to take back migrants it wants to deport.
    


            “It's about power and control and manipulating both the US population to suppress dissent as well as trying to manipulate foreign relations with these countries by getting them to do whatever he wants in order to get off the disfavored nation list,” Bier said.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — There is an unmistakable air of Peckham these days in Bosnia's capital, Sarajevo, as the legendary yellow three-wheeled van from the BBC's long-running sitcom “Only Fools and Horses” cruises the city streets.

The little Reliant Regal was the trademark of the stars of the series — the irresistible Trotter brothers from Peckham, a working-class neighborhood in London. In Bosnia, a replica belongs to the Fatic brothers, local businessmen who are crazy about the show.

The Fatics are dealers in home appliances, running a successful company with dozens of employees and a huge shop on the outskirts of Sarajevo. Building the business, however, has resembled the ups and downs of the Peckham market traders Del Boy and Rodney Trotter, they say.

“We are definitely the local version of the series,” Tarik Fatic, the younger of the brothers, told The Associated Press. “We were always dealing in something, we would buy whatever we can and then sell it.”

The enormously popular BBC sitcom, which began in 1981, follows the lives of the Trotter brothers and their far-from-straightforward path from rags to riches. Over the course of seven series and several Christmas specials, the Trotters tried various get-rich-quick schemes, buying low-quality or sometimes black-market goods and selling them at the market. 




Many in Bosnia and in the wider Balkans easily identify with the Trotters' endless wheeling and dealing. In the region that went through a series of wars in the 1990s, where the economy was shattered and remains deeply corrupt, the Trotter ways of survival are simple reality.

Just like the Trotter brothers, “we always tried to make profit and regardless of how many times we failed, we just moved on,” Tarik Fatic said.

Also from a working-class family, and growing up in a country that was devastated in the bloody 1992-95 ethnic conflict, the brothers tried trading in food, poultry and clothes before settling on home appliances. They are aware there are no guarantees their current success will last. 

“The market (in Bosnia) is still disorganized and unstable,” Tarik Fatic, 33, said. “Not a day passes without the two (Del Boy and Rodney) crossing my mind.” 

Known here as Mucke, which actually means something like wheeling and dealing, “Only Fools and Horses” became hugely popular throughout what was still Yugoslavia from the 1980s onwards. 

Murals with images of main characters have been painted on the walls; many cafes were named after the series, while visiting actors were greeted with frenzy. 

The Reliant Regal was made by a British company, famous for its eccentric vehicles, that went out of business in 2002. 

In Sarajevo, people wave, take pictures with their phones, honk their horns when they see the yellow van in the streets. The Fatic brothers imported it from Manchester six months ago after a long search. It took a while to register the unusual vehicle, said Mirnes Fatic, 38.

“It is a very nice feeling. It's a joy every time I go for a ride in the city,” he said, admitting that it also was “a great advertising move.”

And it's not just the van. The Fatic brothers have also named their company after the series — Only Fools and Horses Brothers Mucke. There have been some doubts how clients and banks would react but it turned out really well, Mirnes added.

“We hope and believe that this time next year, we will be millionaires,” he smiled, using the famous phrase from the show.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) said Thursday that the Democratic Party has trouble making the case that President Donald Trump is corrupt because of the past abuses within its ranks.

“When we talk about Trump's corruption, we're not terribly credible because the American public looks at Democrats and assumes that we're just as corrupt,” Murphy said at a Center for American Progress event in Washington D.C. “And we obviously have had some pretty high-profile problems in our party in the last decade.”

While declining to name specific examples, Murphy said Democrats' 2024 messaging of saving democracy “fell flat” because voters thought “this version of democracy seems rigged” or “only works for the powerful.”

Murphy's comments came at a liberal event in Washington D.C., moderated by Neera Tanden, who is under congressional investigation into whether White House aides covered up former President Joe Biden's health decline. Neither Tanden nor Murphy addressed the controversy, which escalated this week when Trump ordered an investigation into Biden's White House and the House Oversight Committee subpoenaing Biden's doctor.

Murphy, who has become a prominent messenger for the Democratic Party and recently launched a PAC to take on Trump, said that while he had “few quibbles” with Kamala Harris's 2024 campaign, Democrats need to work harder to appeal to young people and men.

“I think young people do fundamentally believe that the Democratic Party is just as corrupt as the Republican Party is, and so while they're noticing Trump's corruption, they don't see it as a reason to come out on the streets, because the alternative doesn't look much better,” Murphy said, citing Trump accepting a luxury jet from Qatar as one example. 

Murphy told the audience that Democrats have a habit of normalizing corrupt government acts by not bringing enough attention to them. He called for “bold” government reforms to restore credibility and to rally around a mission of “unrigging the economy.”

“We probably do need a constitutional amendment to allow us to properly regulate campaign finance,” Murphy said. “And we're not for that because it's hard? Well, that's not a good reason to not be for that.”

Murphy was asked by a college student in the audience about the shift in young men away from liberalism. He criticized the Left for their treatment of male mental health in what he deems as a post-feminism “loss of meaning and purpose.” Democrats have responded that men should “get over it,” and “that's not satisfactory,” Murphy said.

“There is a difference between male identity and female identity and there are still some really important things about masculinity, whether it be physicality or risk-taking, that are still core parts of your identity that you do not have to lose even in a moment when you are competing, rightfully, with women in the workplace,” Murphy said. 

Murphy, who is considered a possible 2028 presidential contender, said Democrats also need to be authentic.

WHITE HOUSE AIDE ACCUSED OF VIOLATING HATCH ACT WITH SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS

“Authenticity of voice is really important for young people. We've got to start talking in an unfiltered way more often,” said Murphy, noting he runs his own social media accounts.

Murphy warned about the “death of democracy” several times and said that it does not happen in one week, but over time, comparing the Trump administration to regimes in Hungary and Turkey.

The American Airlines flight that caught fire soon after taking off from Denver International Airport in March had several parts installed incorrectly and fuel leaks, according to a preliminary report released Thursday. 

The Dallas-bound aircraft had one loose part inside the right engine installed in the wrong direction and fuel leaking from the fitting of another part that was also fastened incorrectly, according to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report.

Soon after the plane took off, the crew noticed issues with the right engine, the report said.

"The captain noted high engine vibration indications for the right engine," the report stated, while the crew discussed whether they needed to divert before contacting American Airlines dispatchers. 

They landed safely, but soon after arriving at a gate, passengers and crew members noticed fire and smoke filling the cabin. Images and video showed passengers evacuating the aircraft and standing on the wings of the plane.

"One of the flight attendants tried calling the flight crew" while another "knocked on the cockpit door to alert the flight crew," the report said.

The NTSB report also showed streaks on the outside of the engine from the leaking fuel. The plane was towed to a hangar for examination.

During an inspection of the damage, investigators saw that the plane "exhibited heat/smoke/burn indications near the right engine nacelle, right wing, right side of the fuselage aft of the wing, the right main landing gear, and the right main landing gear wheel well," the report said. 

In addition, "the lockwire of a fuel fitting on the variable stator vane (VSV)" was loose and installed in the incorrect direction, in addition to other issues. 

Further examination of the engines found that one fan blade platform was fractured, according to the report.

Another part of the plane that controls airflow through the turbine's compressor was found to be "incorrectly fastened and secured … allowing fuel to leak from the fitting."

American Airlines said 172 passengers and six crew members were on board at the time of the incident. 

The airplane had "substantial damage" while 12 passengers and the six crew members sustained minor injuries, according to the report.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt brushed aside a question from a reporter on Elon Musk‘s assertion that Donald Trump hasn't released the files regarding the late convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein because the president is in them.

Musk feuded with Trump on an epic scale Thursday, appearing to call for his impeachment and decommissioning his Dragon spacecraft, among other things, as a result.

“This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,” Leavitt said. “The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again.”

Musk said earlier on Thursday that Trump is in the Epstein files and that is why they haven't been made fully public. Attorney General Pam Bondi promised a full release months ago, but the FBI says they are still redacting victims' likenesses.

“Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,” he posted. “Have a nice day, DJT!”

“Mark this post for the future,” he added. “The truth will come out.”

Trump's association with Epstein is known, but the full extent, or whether the president is associated with his crimes, is not. The president told New York magazine in 2002 what he knew of Epstein, whose 2019 death in a prison cell while he was awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges was ruled a suicide.

“I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,” Trump said. “He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”

Musk also posted about Trump's flights with Epstein and an old video of the president partying with him. He put an emoji with eyebrows raised over both.

STEVE BANNON SAYS ELON MUSK SHOULD BE DEPORTED ‘IMMEDIATELY'

The tech CEO's feud with Trump initially emanated from Musk's disagreements on Trump's “big, beautiful bill.”

Musk thinks the bill doesn't cut spending enough, while Trump has pushed Congress to pass the legislation to keep his tax cuts in effect.

Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., discusses Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoing a bill that would have prevented China from buying land next to military bases on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Mexican drug cartels are getting help from the Chinese to build their drug empire that feeds off American consumers. 

Border patrol officials intercepted 50,000 kilos of precursor chemicals this week used in the process of manufacturing methamphetamines, sent from China and intended for members of the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico. In addition to providing the cartels with the chemicals needed to make illicit drugs, Chinese entities are also one of the foremost actors in helping them launder their proceeds, according to the Treasury Department.

"For far too long, the Mexican drug cartels have raked in billions of dollars at the expense of our local communities leaving nothing but addiction, death and despair in their wake," said Chad Plantz, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent in Charge in Houston. "This initiative provides HSI with a game-changing method to stay one step ahead of the cartels by disrupting the flow of chemicals that they depend on to produce illicit narcotics."

The seizure was part of an ongoing initiative launched in 2019 to identify suspicious shipments of precursor chemicals from China, India and other countries that are destined for Mexican drug cartels. Since the initiative was established, officials have interdicted more than 1,700,000 kilograms of chemicals used to manufacture methamphetamines and fentanyl, including a seizure this past March of 44,000 kilograms of precursor chemicals at the Port of Houston, destined for the Sinaloa Cartel.

Immigration officials' bust comes amid news of a spate of other incidents involving Chinese nationals or individuals working for China who have engaged in espionage efforts, ranging from agroterroism and selling military secrets, to infiltrating U.S. universities and utilizing American-based products to sow political divisions online.

In the latest incident, two Chinese nationals were charged with allegedly smuggling a "dangerous biological pathogen" into the U.S. to study at a University of Michigan laboratory. This happened amid controversy over the Trump administration's effort to intensify visa scrutiny for Chinese nationals trying to enter the United States.

CHINESE OFFICIAL REPORTEDLY SEEKING TALKS WITH TRUMP ON FENTANYL INGREDIENTS AMID TRADE WAR

Last month, an expansive investigation by a group of Stanford students detailed how there is a culture of students and faculty at their school doing work for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The report highlighted how some students want to work with the Chinese government, such as through sharing intellectual property or aligning their research priorities with Chinese interests, while others are sometimes coerced into doing work for the CCP, particularly if they have family back in Beijing.

Meanwhile, just this week, reports of Chinese efforts to steal U.S. state secrets or sow political divisions have surfaced. 

On Friday, the Department of Justice indicted two Chinese nationals and a lawful permanent resident for conspiring to traffic sensitive American military technology to the CCP. 

Over the weekend, a British businessman was arrested for attempting to smuggle sensitive U.S. military components to China. 

American artifical intelligence company OpenAI this week also shutdown a Chinese-linked influence operation that was utilizing its ChatGPT product to generate social media posts and sow political division related to U.S. politics online.

"The new visa policy is long overdue," Congresswoman Michele Steel said. "After four years of willful ignorance – or gross incompetence – under the Biden administration, President Trump has wasted no time in directing his administration to take the decisive, necessary action to finally thwart the pervasive and growing threat of Chinese communist espionage."

Chris Van Hollen meets with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, left, at an undisclosed location in San Salvador, El Salvador, in this handout provided by Sen. Chris Van Hollen's Office, on April 17.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man wrongly deported by the Trump administration to a prison in El Salvador, is being brought back to the US to face federal charges that he illegally transported undocumented immigrants within the country.

Abrego Garcia was indicted by a grand jury in Tennessee in May, according to court filings released Friday. In the indictment, the government alleges he was a member of the notorious MS-13 criminal gang.

Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange and custodian founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has confidentially filed for an IPO in the U.S., according to a press release on Friday. 

The number of shares and the pricing terms have not yet been decided upon, and the company said a listing "is expected to occur after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market and other conditions."

By filing confidentially, Gemini can test investor appetite and prepare for a public debut without immediate scrutiny of its financials. The announcement comes after the SEC wrapped up its investigation into Gemini in February without recommending enforcement action, and follows a $5 million settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in January.

Gemini is the latest crypto firm to pursue a public listing as President Donald Trump's administration pushes more favorable regulations for the industry, which heavily funded his campaign. 

Stablecoin issuer Circle held a blockbuster debut this week, with its stock soaring in its first two days on the market. Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital moved its listing from Toronto to the Nasdaq last month. 

Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange and custodian, was founded by the Winklevoss twins in 2014. In March, the company named former Affirm executive Dan Chen as its CFO in preparation for a public offering. 

"I'm looking forward to helping Gemini scale by driving financial strategy as the company enters its next phase of growth," Chen wrote in a post on LinkedIn at the time.

Amazon's retail business is locking down its hiring budget.

According to an internal email, this major part of the company will keep a "flat headcount opex," or operating expenses, this year compared to 2024. Headcount operating expense refers to employee salaries plus their stock-based compensation, the email noted.

The update was shared earlier this year by a finance leader in Amazon's retail unit. This executive explained that any increase in the hiring budget will be "scrutinized" and require "strong supporting reasons." Business Insider obtained copy of the email.

The retail business is also shifting from managing "opex targets versus headcount targets," according to the email. That likely means managers now have a strict predefined budget allocated to their teams, instead of specific headcount targets when hiring.

These changes only apply to corporate employees in Amazon's retail business. They do not apply to staff working in Amazon warehouses and in the company's cloud division, Amazon Web Services.

The retail organization includes everything from Amazon's online marketplace to its logistics arm and Fresh grocery business.

In an email to BI, Amazon spokesperson Zoe Hoffman said this is the "responsible way" to grow a company of its size, and stressed that not growing the hiring budget in a given year is not the same as not hiring. Amazon continues to hire across the company, she added.

"Each of Amazon's many businesses has its own approach to hiring based on its individual needs," Hoffman added in a statement. "However, across the company, we've historically considered both the number of people we need to hire and the associated costs — that is, Operating Expenses or OpEx — of those hiring decisions."

The move underscores CEO Andy Jassy's relentless push for increased efficiency and higher profit margins.

Since taking over in 2021, he's slashed jobs, revamped pay, trimmed management layers, and even reconsidered Amazon's product listing approach, all in the name of saving money and driving efficiency. Amazon reported record profit of $59 billion in 2024, nearly double its 2023 result.

Holding the hiring budget steady could encourage Amazon retail managers to get smarter and more flexible with compensation expenses. HR professionals say budget-based planning offers tighter financial control than headcount targets. That can be useful in uncertain business environments.

The email said Amazon retail CEO Doug Herrington inspected operating expenses "very closely throughout the last two years." The retail organization also recently launched new financial reporting and analysis tools for tracking headcount and operating expenses. Some of the new features include the ability to plan headcount mix by job level, technical skills, and tenure, according to the email.

Amazon has been on a yearslong cost-cutting spree. After booming during the pandemic, the online retail and cloud giant's growth slowed, triggering cutbacks in warehouse growth and the closure of some experimental ventures.

Headcount has also leveled off. The company doubled its workforce to 1.6 million from 2019 to 2021, but that number dipped to 1.55 million last year. Amazon has cut at least 27,000 employees since late 2022.

Managing headcount instead of a hiring budget lets managers bring on high-cost talent without worrying much about salary, David Kryscynski, a human resources professor at Rutgers, told BI. But with a fixed labor budget, he said, managers are more likely to stay within financial limits, either by hiring less or opting for lower-cost candidates.

This model also gives managers more staffing flexibility, said Shaun Pichler, a management professor at California State University, Fullerton. Without headcount targets, they can bring on cheaper contractors or temporary workers. And they're not pressured to spend the full budget, often resulting in leaner teams.

"Tech firms have more widely adopted OpEx targets post-pandemic for largely the same reasons — high labor costs, reduced revenues, and to give managers more flexibility," Pichler said.

Amazon's retail arm remains laser-focused on cutting costs. At an internal all-hands meeting earlier this year, retail chief Doug Herrington told employees that belt-tightening would likely extend into 2025, even as the company pours money into major investments elsewhere, BI previously reported.

"We have to keep reducing costs so that we can afford the big investments in big new businesses," Herrington said.

In this article

China has granted temporary export licenses to rare-earth suppliers of the top three U.S. automakers, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, as supply chain disruptions begin to surface from Beijing's export curbs on those materials.

At least some of the licenses are valid for six months, the two sources said, declining to be named because the information is not public. It was not immediately clear what quantity or items are covered by the approval or whether the move signals China is preparing to ease the rare-earths licensing process, which industry groups say is cumbersome and has created a supply bottleneck.

China's decision in April to restrict exports of a wide range of rare earths and related magnets has tripped up the supply chains central to automakers, aerospace manufacturers, semiconductor companies and military contractors around the world.

China's dominance of the critical mineral industry, key to the green energy transition, is increasingly viewed as a key point of leverage for Beijing in its trade war with U.S. President Donald Trump. China produces around 90% of the world's rare earths, and auto industry representatives have warned of increasing threats to production due to their dependency on it for those parts.

Suppliers of three big U.S. automakers, General Motors, Ford and Jeep-maker Stellantis got clearance for some rare earth export licenses on Monday, one of the two sources said.

GM and Ford each declined to comment. Stellantis said it is working with suppliers "to ensure an efficient licensing process" and that so far the company has been able to "address immediate production concerns without major disruptions."

China's Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.

China's critical-mineral export controls have become a focus on Trump's criticism of Beijing, which he says has violated the truce reached last month to roll back tariffs and trade restrictions.

On Thursday, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping had a lengthy phone call to iron out trade differences. Trump said in social-media post that "there should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products." Both sides said teams will meet again soon.

U.S. auto companies are already feeling the impact of the restrictions. Ford shut down production of its Explorer SUV at its Chicago plant for a week in May because of a rare-earth shortage, the company said.

The approval for the auto suppliers follows a green light granted to a U.S. electronics firm's suppliers last week and another one issued earlier this week to suppliers of a U.S. non-auto company, the first person said, declining to name the companies.

"We have to give the Chinese the benefit of the doubt that they're working through this. It's up to them to show that they are not weaponizing it," said the person.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that China has introduced a tracking system for its rare earth magnet sector in a move to improve its control over the sector and crackdown on smuggling.

This was CNBC's live blog covering European financial markets.

European stock markets rose after digesting news of the ECB rate cut and the upward revision of first-quarter eurozone GDP this week.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 rose 0.3%. France's CAC 40 was up 0.2%. Meanwhile, Germany's DAX fell 0.1%

Why are UBS shares rallying after the Swiss government proposed tough new capital rules?

JPMorgan analysts might also have the answer to that question.

"Today's outcome is positive for UBS, based on our initial view, although we need to go through the full set of documents, due to the long timeframe for implementation in our view," said JPMorgan's analyst Kian Abouhossein in a note to clients.

Shares of the bank jumped as much as 6% after Switzerland announced highly-anticipated capital regulations calling on UBS to hold an additional $26 billion in Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital.

However, the earliest that regulations will apply in full will be 2033. The law would be finalised by 2027 at the earliest, with six years given to implement the changes.

The Wall Street bank's analysts said that UBS is expected to generate around $12 billion [per annum] in profits with a dividend of about $3 billion, which means the bank can "fulfill its 'capital gap' by 2033+ and still continue with buybacks."

Why are UBS shares rallying after the Swiss government proposed tough new capital rules?

Shares of the bank jumped as much as 6% after Switzerland announced highly-anticipated capital regulations calling on UBS to hold an additional $26 billion in Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital.

Johann Scholtz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, says the proposals are "as bad as it will get for UBS" — but that could give the bank some breathing room to lobby for concessions.

"As we expected, there will be a long phase-out for UBS to deploy this, with the earliest that it will apply in full being 2034," says Johann Scholtz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar.

"However, negotiations will start immediately," he added. That means UBS "can now lobby for some concessions and take some actions themselves to mitigate impact, for instance upstream some excess capital from its subsidiaries," according to the analyst.

Shares of UBS rose 5.4% after the Swiss government proposed strict new capital regulations which would require the banking giant to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital, following its 2023 takeover of stricken rival Credit Suisse.

The move comes on the heels of a review carried out after the forced merger of Credit Suisse with UBS to avert a full-blown banking crisis in Switzerland.

"The rise in the going-concern requirement needs to be met with up to USD 26 billion of CET1 capital, to allow the AT1 bond holdings to be reduced by around USD 8 billion," the government said in statement Friday, referring to UBS' holding of Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds.

On Thursday, the U.S. Treasury Department added nine economies to a "monitoring list" of trading partners "whose currency practices and macroeconomic policies merit close attention."

Back in 2020, the U.S. Treasury, under the first Trump administration, labeled Switzerland a currency manipulator, accusing it of deliberately devaluing the Swiss franc against the U.S. dollar. The department stopped short of using the term "currency manipulator" on Thursday.

"The SNB does not engage in any manipulation of the Swiss franc," the Swiss National Bank said in a statement on Friday. "It does not seek to prevent adjustments in the balance of trade or to gain unfair competitive advantages for the Swiss economy."

A spokesperson for the SNB noted that it may need to intervene in foreign exchange markets if deemed necessary for the Swiss economy, which recently fell into disinflation as a soaring Swiss franc lowered the cost of imports.

The safe-haven Swiss franc, which has gained around 9.5% against the U.S. currency so far this year, was last seen trading 0.2% lower against the greenback.

Stéphane Boujnah, CEO of Euronext, visited the CNBC studio in London this morning to chat to the "Squawk Box Europe" anchors about regional markets.

He said interest in Europe had already started to pick up "before the Trump moment," but tariffs-induced volatility worsened the trend.

"Many people decided that if you want to have your money in a predictable environment, in a rule of law environment, in an environment where the basic assumption of capitalism operates, then Europe is not a bad place," Boujnah said. "That translated into people shorting U.S. assets to move to Europe. It was not massive, but it's significant and continuing."

Euronext operates exchanges in several European markets, including Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Milan.

The Bank of Russia has announced it will cut interest rates to 20% from 21%, the first reduction since September 2022. 

The inflation rate in April was 6.2%, it said, down from an average 8.2% across the first quarter of 2025.

"While domestic demand growth is still outstripping the capabilities to expand the supply of goods and services, the Russian economy is gradually returning to a balanced growth path," the central bank said Friday, adding that monetary policy would remain tight "for a long period" in order to return inflation to its 4% target.

Tesla shares were 4.5% higher in premarket trade at 4:31 a.m. ET, after a war of words between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump helped wipe $152 billion off its value on Thursday, the biggest-ever hit to its market cap.

— Jenni Reid

The European Stoxx Automobiles and Parts index is 0.5% lower in early trade, after electric vehicle behemoth Tesla saw $152 billion wiped from its market cap in the wake of CEO Elon Musk's public spat with U.S. President Donald Trump.

The sector has already seen volatile trade this week, as investors reacted to Trump doubling tariffs on steel to 50%.

BMW is currently 1% lower, while Volkswagen shares are 0.9% lower and Stellantis is down 0.8%.

Europe's Stoxx 600 index is fractionally higher at 8:17 a.m. London time, up around 0.02%, coming off the back of three positive sessions. 

The U.K.'s FTSE 100 is leading the way with a 0.15% rise as oil and gas stocks advance amid higher crude prices, though Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 are down 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively.

In case you missed it, the spat between U.S. President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, the world's richest person, entered new territory overnight.

What began with Musk publicly slamming Trump's spending bill has evolved into a full-on row between the two, with the president threatening to withdraw billions of dollars' worth of government contracts for Musk's companies. 

Musk, meanwhile, claimed Trump would never have won a second term in office without his input in the campaign, and said SpaceX would immediately decommission its Dragon spacecraft due to Trump's threats to cut funding.

In the fallout, Tesla saw $152 billion wiped off of its market cap — the biggest hit to its valuation ever.

Good morning from London.

European stocks look set to turn lower in the last trading session of the week, as investors around the world await more key data for clues on the shape of the U.S. economy.

FTSE 100 futures are currently 0.1% lower, while futures tied to the French CAC 40 and Germany's DAX are down by 0.4% and 0.1%, respectively.

Regional stocks ended Thursday's session higher after the European Central Bank trimmed interest rates in a widely anticipated move.

U.S. nonfarm payrolls data is due to be published later on Friday, with economists expecting a contraction in jobs from the previous month.

Trade tensions are also still in focus for global investors after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Thursday. Trump said the 90-minute call was "very good" and "almost entirely" focused on trade.

Overnight in Asia, stocks have been trading in mixed territory as investors digest the news that Trump and Xi held what the U.S. President described as a "very good" call. 

On Wall Street, U.S. stock futures are trading higher ahead of May's nonfarm payrolls data.

The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to lift a court order to reinstate U.S. Department of Education employees the administration had terminated as part of its efforts to dismantle the agency.

Officials for the administration are arguing to the high court that U.S. District Judge Myong Joun in Boston didn't have the authority to require the Education Department to rehire the workers. More than 1,300 employees were affected by the mass layoffs in March.

The staff reduction "effectuates the Administration's policy of streamlining the Department and eliminating discretionary functions that, in the Administration's view, are better left to the States," Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the filing.

A federal appeals court had refused on Wednesday to lift the judge's ruling.

In his May 22 preliminary injunction, Joun pointed out that the staff cuts led to the closure of seven out of 12 offices tasked with the enforcement of civil rights, including protecting students from discrimination on the basis of race and disability.

Meanwhile, the entire team that supervises the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, was also eliminated, the judge said. (Around 17 million families apply for college aid each year using the form, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.)

The Education Department cannot be abolished without approval by Congress.

The Trump administration announced its reduction in force on March 11 that would have gutted the agency's staff.

Two days later, 21 states — including Michigan, Nevada and New York — filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for its staff cuts.

After President Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 20 aimed at dismantling the Education Department, more parties sued to save the department, including the American Federation of Teachers.

Former President Jimmy Carter established the current-day U.S. Department of Education in 1979. Since then, the agency has faced other existential threats, with former President Ronald Reagan calling for its end and Trump, during his first term, attempting to merge it with the Labor Department.

Just under three months ago, President Donald Trump stood next to Elon Musk outside the White House to choose a new Tesla. Following his explosive feud with the Tesla CEO, Trump may be about to ditch his shiny EV too.

A senior White House official confirmed to Business Insider that Trump was considering selling or giving away the red Model S, which has a list price of about $80,000. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news.

Trump picked out the Model S from a lineup of Tesla vehicles during a sales pitch-like event with Musk at the White House in March.

At the time, it was a show of support from Trump to his biggest financial backer, with Tesla stock plunging and the company becoming a target for protests due to Musk's efforts to slash the government workforce at DOGE.

At the event, Trump said he was buying a Tesla because "it's a great product, as good as it gets," and because Musk had "devoted his energy and his life to doing this, and I think he's been treated very unfairly by a very small group of people."

Since then, the relationship between the president and the world's richest person has taken a dramatic turn for the worst.

A high-profile spat began on Thursday with Musk criticising Trump's "big, beautiful" tax bill in a series of posts on X. Trump then called the billionaire "crazy" and suggested that "the easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts."

The feud damaged Tesla's stock price, closing down 14% on Thursday and wiping $138 billion off the company's valuation. Shares staged a recovery on Friday, rising nearly 5% in morning trading and remain down by a fifth this year.

If Trump does decide to sell his Model S, he should probably get a move on. A study by used car site iSeeCars in April found that used Model S prices had dropped more than any other model over the past year, as the resale value of used Teslas continues to slide.

Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Federal Reserve's new top regulatory official laid out an ambitious agenda for revisiting and easing numerous bank rules and oversight policies which she argued have become onerous and unnecessary.

Michelle Bowman, who was confirmed to be the Fed's Vice Chair for Supervision on Wednesday, said the Fed will be reconsidering how it writes rules and polices some of the nation's largest and most complex banks. In prepared remarks, she argued that the influx of rules since the 2008 financial crisis merits reconsideration.

"Our goal should not be to prevent banks from failing or even eliminate the risk that they will. Our goal should be to make banks safe to fail, meaning that they can be allowed to fail without threatening to destabilize the rest of the banking system," she said.

Bowman, who has served as a Fed governor since 2018, has long been critical of efforts to impose stricter rules on the banking sector. In her first remarks since being confirmed to the Fed's top regulatory post, she said the Fed will soon launch numerous projects aimed at easing requirements and streamlining oversight, including in many areas that have been longtime targets for complaints by banks.

Among those initiatives will be changes to how the Fed supervises large banks, plans to make some bank rules less restrictive, and a consideration of changes that could ease the bank merger process.

Apple:

Company set to highlight software redesigns as it remains on sidelines of AI revolution.

Apple's previous WWDC event last June.

Apple Inc.'s upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference will do little to assuage fears that the iPhone maker is a laggard in AI. Instead, the event will focus on design and productivity enhancements for its long-established operating system franchises.

The company's keynote address, which begins at 10 a.m. Pacific time on Monday, will introduce redesigned software interfaces for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV and Apple Watch, in addition to more minor tweaks to the Vision Pro headset.

Donald Trump speaks during a news conference with Elon Musk in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on May 30.

The White House is signaling that President Donald Trump intends to move on from his acrimonious fallout with billionaire Elon Musk, focusing on securing passage of his signature tax and spending bill and other economic policies.

After Thursday's blow-up, in which Trump and Musk traded threats of cutting government contracts and ending spaceflight programs, the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer indicated a willingness to defuse tensions, suggesting an eagerness for an off-ramp for a clash that risks costing his companies deeply.

LONDON — The U.K. is set to lift a ban on a key type of crypto debt security in a bid to catch up to the U.S. and other financial hubs as it looks to become a global hub for digital assets.

On Friday, the Financial Conduct Authority, the U.K.'s main regulator for financial services, announced a proposal to reverse its ban on offering crypto exchange-traded notes to retail investors.

Exchange-traded notes are a type of debt instrument that are linked to one or more specified assets — cryptocurrencies, in this case. In essence, they allow investors to gain exposure to digital tokens through the use of a regulated exchange.

Sales of crypto ETNs to retail investors have been prohibited in the U.K. since the FCA put in place a ban in 2019 due to concerns over the potential harms they pose to consumers.

On Friday, however, the FCA said it proposed lifting the ban on crypto ETNs "to support UK growth and competitiveness." A restriction on crypto derivatives will remain in place, the watchdog added.

"This consultation demonstrates our commitment to supporting the growth and competitiveness of the UK's crypto industry," David Geale, executive director of payments and digital assets at the FCA, said in a statement.

"We want to rebalance our approach to risk and lifting the ban would allow people to make the choice on whether such a high-risk investment is right for them, given they could lose all their money."

The development was swiftly praised by crypto firms as a significant moment for the industry in the U.K. Britain is often perceived as falling behind the U.S., European Union and other global players when it comes to digital assets.

Spot crypto exchange-traded funds have been available in the U.S. since the Securities and Exchange Commission approved rule changes to allow the creation of the first bitcoin-linked ETFs early last year.

In April, the U.K. government published draft legislation for the crypto sector with the goal of making the country a "world leader in digital assets." The FCA is separately working through a detailed roadmap of consultations and discussion papers with a view to implement a regulatory regime for crypto by 2026.

"Until now, the UK has been an outlier on ETNs. We hope this move will improve consumer protections and we will continue to make the case for lifting the ban on retail investors from accessing highly-regulated derivative products," said Ian Taylor, board advisor to crypto trade body CryptoUK.

Kraken's U.K. General Manager Bivu Das said that the proposal to approve sales of crypto ETNs to consumers marked a "major milestone for the UK's crypto ecosystem."

The FCA is "acknowledging that the market has matured significantly and that outdated restrictions no longer serve their intended purpose," Das added. "Regulatory moves like this are critical if the UK is to stay competitive in the race to lead in digital assets."

President Donald Trump is "not interested" in a call with Tesla CEO Elon Musk to resolve their feud, a senior White House official told NBC News on Friday morning.

The two billionaires launched a war of words on Thursday over Musk's continued criticism of Trump's proposed tax bill, which is pending in the Senate.

Trump said Musk, who until a week ago was one of his top government advisors, had gone "crazy" and threatened to kill federal contracts with his companies, which include SpaceX.

Musk, in turn, said Trump could not have been elected president without his massive financial support, and accused the Republican of ingratitude for that, and for lying in saying that he had ousted Musk from the White House because the CEO was "wearing thin."

Musk also said SpaceX would decommission its Dragon spacecraft, the only current U.S. method of transporting crew to and from the International Space Station. Musk later said Dragon would not be decommissioned.

"No. I won't be speaking to him for a while I guess, but I wish him well," Trump told CNN, that outlet reported Friday morning.

 "I'm not even thinking about Elon. He's got a problem. The poor guy's got a problem," Trump said.

Trump's chief of staff, Susie Wiles, separately told NBC News that "there are no plans for that today," when asked about a report by Politico that White House aides "scheduled a call Friday with the billionaire CEO of Tesla to broker a peace."

But an administration official told NBC, "There could be anything — I'd like to de-escalate a very unfortunate situation."

"There are no calls on the books, at least not now," the official said.

Tesla stock climbed about 5% Friday after threats and insults between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump fueled a $152 billion rout for the company's market cap a day earlier.

"I think the real story here is the investor base of Tesla literally doesn't care about anything," Josh Brown,  CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management and CNBC PRO contributor, told CNBC's "Halftime Report" Friday. "This is still a nothing matters stock."

Analysts cited a Politico report that Trump had scheduled a call Friday with Musk to broker a truce. However, a senior White House official told NBC News Friday that Trump is "not interested" in a call with Musk.

"Musk needs Trump and Trump needs Musk for many reasons and these two becoming friends again will be a huge relief for Tesla shares," wrote Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives in a note Friday morning. "We will be monitoring the situation closely today but we believe Tesla shares are way oversold on this news."

Musk spent several days attacking the president's signature tax and spending bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination," after the Tesla chief's tenure as head of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency came to an end last week.

The war of words between Musk and Trump erupted Thursday as Trump addressed Musk's criticism directly.

"I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot," Trump said, adding that Musk was upset about the exclusion of EV credits in the budget bill.

Musk reacted in real-time to the president's jabs, and the tone escalated.

"Without me, Trump would have lost the election," Musk posted on X. "Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate."

Musk later indicated that Trump should be impeached and claimed the president "is in the Epstein files," referring to records pertaining to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Trump has denied any involvement in Epstein's criminal behavior, and Musk provided no evidence to back up the claim.

Trump took to his own social media platform, Truth Social, to respond.

"The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts," Trump wrote. "I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!"

Tesla shares slide throughout the public clash, closing down 14% and putting the company's market cap below the $1 trillion benchmark.

Adam Foroughi tends to eschew the typical trappings of a billionaire.

He has one car, and would rather it were self-driving. He rarely appears on TV or conference stages. In his downtime, you're more likely to find him at home with his five children than schmoozing on the slopes of Davos. People who know him point to his mild manner and lack of ego.

His advertising technology company, AppLovin, is similarly unflashy. With an ad network that reaches around a billion daily users and a market cap more than twice that of Snap, Pinterest, and Reddit combined, it was the technology behemoth you'd never heard of.

"We're a $100 billion-plus company, not many people know of us, so that's probably a flaw on me," Foroughi told Business Insider in an interview.

Then came April.

Ahead of a June 19 deadline, AppLovin and Foroughi, 45, made a last-minute bid to acquire the international assets of TikTok as the Chinese-owned company faces a potential ban in the US.

It's an audacious move for any company, let alone one with a founder who usually goes out of his way to avoid the spotlight.

It faces an uphill battle. Competition is fierce. President Donald Trump has said he's been negotiating with multiple potential buyers. Investors like Kevin O'Leary of "Shark Tank" fame and former Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have signaled interest, and other tech companies are in the mix.

At AppLovin, Foroughi is known for running a ruthlessly efficient ship that drives hard for profit. It's not unusual for the company to reduce head count even when it's doing well. Foroughi executes with a hands-on management style that has, at times, seen him struggle to delegate to execs who don't fit the mold. And the company's recent financial success has also caught the attention of short sellers who have raised questions about its data practices.

With TikTok, Foroughi would be taking on an organization with a much bigger spotlight — and the heat that comes from running a user-generated content business popular among teens and often lambasted by parents.

Most of the former AppLovin employees, competitors, and business associates who spoke with BI believe he's up to the task. They say Foroughi's smarts, as well as his tendency to forgo the marketing jazz hands and let the product do the talking, position him well to crank up the dial for TikTok's ad business.

"We've been competing for over a decade, and I've never seen anyone like him — he's all around amazing, it hurts me to say it," said an executive at one of AppLovin's competitors. "He's the most talented CEO I have ever seen."

Foroughi acknowledged that the TikTok bid is uncharted territory for him, but "I don't really care about 'uncomfortable,'" he said. "I do what I think is right for my business."

Foroughi and his family fled Iran when he was four years old, in the fallout of the Iranian Revolution.

They settled in Laguna Beach, California. His father, once one of Iran's leading real estate developers, left nearly all his wealth behind, and the family had to adjust to a more frugal lifestyle, a new culture, and a different language.

"My parents had to give up a lot to get us over here," Foroughi said. "Knowing that, you always have this motivation inside you to perform."

After graduating with a degree in finance from the University of California, Berkeley, Foroughi took a job as a derivatives trader. He found it a lonely existence. He wanted to build something of his own, and he wanted to work with people.

He worked at a marketing agency for small businesses, which later morphed into a social media marketing company. Eventually, as the app stores of Apple and Google became dominant, he looked to apps.

With a small team of engineers in Palo Alto, Foroughi created a fashion app, then a dating app.

"They stunk," Foroughi said. "We got rid of them."

In 2012, they launched their third attempt — an app that allowed friends to connect and send recommendations for other apps to download. This one stuck. If you were playing "Words with Friends," the app could send a push notification to your contacts, asking them to join. AppLovin was born.

Like many tech companies, AppLovin — which Foroughi insists wasn't inspired by McLovin, the nerdy character in the stoner film "Superbad" — decided to pivot to advertising. It expanded from a ground-floor garage to offices on three continents, and more than 1,500 employees as of December 2024, and a market capitalization of $140 billion at the time of publication.

The business model is fairly simple: It helps app developers make money and find users using in-app ads. But under the surface is a highly optimized AI-powered algorithm designed to entice businesses with the promise that chucking $1 into the machine will net $2, $5, or $10 in profit.

It's a snug fit for TikTok, where ads for figure-hugging jeans, grip socks for soccer, and campaigns for major brands like Coca-Cola and Apple are slotted between consumable vertical videos. While TikTok has soared in popularity, particularly among Gen Z, its ad revenue lags behind Google, Meta, and Amazon. AppLovin thinks its adtech can help close the gap.

AppLovin has also widened its aperture beyond its core gaming roots in recent months. After it opened up its ad platform to e-commerce advertisers, some said that they were excited for an alternative to Meta, which had become increasingly expensive in their hunt for new customers. Mike True, CEO of the e-commerce marketing platform Prescient AI, said AppLovin is the fourth most invested-in channel among its advertiser clients, behind Meta, Google, and Amazon Ads.

"The fact that advertisers continue to invest in AppLovin, even amid a cautious market, suggests growing confidence in its long-term role within the performance stack," True said.

Last year, the company posted net income of $1.58 billion at 34% margins — a margin profile almost on a par with Meta, and ahead of its closest adtech rival, The Trade Desk, which had a profit margin of 16% in 2024. AppLovin's annual revenue rose 43% to $4.7 billion.

But some observers said that while AppLovin helped e-commerce advertisers extract more sales from current customers, it was less effective in driving sales from new ones. Jones Road Beauty was one of AppLovin's early e-commerce clients, but its CEO, Cody Plofker, told BI it's no longer using AppLovin.

"We found it not to be very incremental with new customers," Plofker said.

Foroughi said that the e-commerce product is still in its infancy and doesn't yet work for everyone.

"But it will as we build it out," he added.

One Silicon Valley tech veteran who interacted with AppLovin in the early years said taking meetings with Foroughi was a "breath of fresh air." He cut to the chase, no two-martini lunches necessary.

"We got on calls and he'd be very to the point, versus the mindset where relationships precede business — a very Valley kind of guy," the person said.

Simon Spaull was AppLovin's first hire in Europe in 2014. He reluctantly entertained the idea at first.

"No one had heard of it and it was a rubbish name," Spaull said.

He was soon convinced. Spaull stayed at the company for almost seven years, as it continuously posted record annual revenue, mostly growing traction through word of mouth in the gaming community.

Foroughi has remained deeply enmeshed with day-to-day operations, including customer service. Up until around a year ago, he ran product and human resources alongside his CEO role. (He said he wanted to "get more involved in making sure our culture is aligned with the principles we had when we started the business.") When he's not traveling, he sits among the engineers.

"You don't know what's going on in your business if you don't work with your employees," Foroughi said.

Foroughi has said some of the biggest mistakes he made as CEO involved taking outside advice, including briefly hiring a chief operating officer in 2012.

"I thought, what's the point of me at this company, I'm hands-on, I'm not going to defer to this hire," Foroughi said at a recent conference held by the investment bank Jefferies.

He had a similar reaction after following advice to bring on a chief revenue officer and a brand ad sales team, with staffers who were paid more than the company's best engineer, the person making the actual product.

"It bugged the crap out of me," Foroughi said. He scrapped the entire team.

The company's strategy has been defined in part by unrelenting efficiency. Foroughi, who said he considers Elon Musk as an inspiration, counts EBITDA — or profit — per employee as one of his most important success metrics.

The company recently sold off its entire mobile gaming studio business — developers of hit games like "Mobile Strike" and "Project Makeover" — deeming it surplus after the apps had been sucked for data to use for its advertising algorithms.

Foroughi also showed a cut-throat streak in 2022, when the gaming software development company Unity announced its intention to acquire AppLovin's app advertising rival, IronSource. Seeking to derail the merger, AppLovin put in an unsolicited $20 billion bid to merge with Unity, but only on the provision that Unity drop the IronSource deal. Rather than make his offer to Unity's management team and the board, Foroughi went public to appeal directly to Unity's main shareholders: the investment firms Sequoia and Silver Lake.

Unity's management team wasn't happy, and they rejected the hostile takeover bid.

Foroughi has no regrets.

"The only way to disrupt that deal" was for AppLovin to make its takeover offer public, Foroughi said. "Yes, it was a little uncomfortable, obviously."

Those within Foroughi's orbit say the billionaire has a generous side.

A banker who worked on AppLovin's 2021 initial public offering recalled receiving an updated draft of the registration statement and noticing that Foroughi had recently sold off around $10 million of stock, at a low price, pre-IPO. He asked Foroughi why.

"He's like, 'Uh, I'm surprised you found that. Yes, I sold some stock back to the company to distribute it to the team that was under-equitized," the person said.

The TikTok suitor is no stranger to US-China tensions. In 2016, Foroughi signed a deal with a Chinese private-equity firm that valued AppLovin at $1.4 billion, and would provide a $1 billion cash injection. The deal was blocked by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States on national security grounds.

"CFIUS saved my ass," Foroughi said at the Jefferies Private Growth Conference earlier this year, referring to AppLovin's financial performance since.

The company's methods have been called into question in recent months with four short-seller reports, published in quick succession.

The most high-profile, from Carson Block's Muddy Waters Research, said AppLovin was "impermissibly extracting" data from top apps like Meta, Google, and TikTok, and targeting ads at "high value users" without their consent. The report also said AppLovin was using underhanded techniques to claim credit for sales it didn't generate.

In an email to BI, Block said that Muddy Waters believed Foroughi "lied" in a March blog post, when he pushed back on the idea that the company "uses persistent user identifiers without their consent." Persistent identifiers follow users across different websites and devices, and it can be difficult for users to delete them or even know they exist. Muddy Waters said AppLovin's use of these IDs violates various platforms' terms of service and privacy laws in some jurisdictions.

Block also said that Foroughi's background pre-AppLovin "supports our opinion that he should not be trusted." He was referring to Foroughi's tenure at a company called Claria, which owned a controversial eWallet software called Gator, that was said at the time to have distributed "adware" that collected users' browsing habits, and bombarded them with pop-up ads. One of Foroughi's early ad networks, SocialHour, was removed from Facebook in 2009 for violating its platform policies.

Foroughi has previously said in blog posts that the short-seller reports were "littered with inaccuracies and false assertions" and were aimed at driving down AppLovin's share price for their own financial gain. He told BI that he worked at Claria for a few months as a 25-year-old. In response to questions about SocialHour, he said all companies that monetized Facebook's inventory were removed when Facebook brought monetization in-house.

Some industry insiders saw the reports as confirmation of their bafflement at AppLovin's success, particularly in light of its reliance on mobile games, which are not always highly valued by big brands and agencies.

AppLovin has proposed merging its company with all of TikTok's international business — not just TikTok US. Foroughi describes this as an "enhancement" to Oracle, which is TikTok's cloud provider in the US. Under AppLovin's proposal, Oracle would still provide data storage and security. Oracle didn't respond to requests for comment.

AppLovin has also pitched itself as a salve for TikTok's woes.

"There are really big national security and data issues, and I think we could solve them," Foroughi told BI.

AppLovin says it has expertise in both handling user data and controlling complex algorithms, which it believes could help it remove biases from TikTok's content recommendation system.

"I see what folks in the administration are doing now, what someone like Elon has sacrificed to give back to the country, and I think we could play a small part here," Foroughi said in an interview that took place before Musk and Trump's spectacular falling out this week.

TikTok didn't respond to a request for comment.

Ari Paparo, a former Googler and adtech exec who now runs the marketing media company Marketecture, said AppLovin has some big advantages in its TikTok bid: Its monster market capitalization makes the financial side feasible, it has proven monetization capabilities that could make ads on TikTok better, and it isn't "Big Tech," which has drawn antitrust scrutiny.

On the other hand, he said, "The company is a bit of an unknown in DC."

That may soon change. In April, Foroughi was spotted at the launch party of Donald Trump Jr.'s private members club.

"​​I'm reclusive by design, so part of the challenge has been that I have to get out there, and get to be known, and I just wasn't before this," Foroughi said.

The bromance is over.

An extraordinary social media feud between U.S. President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk Thursday showcased the public fracturing of their once-close relationship.

Here's a rundown of how Trump and Musk got here:

Musk publicly endorses Trump following an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.

Musk posts on social media platform X: "I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery."

In August, Musk held a conversation with Trump on X. The glitchy livestream got off to an inauspicious start, with technical difficulties delaying the event for almost an hour.

Trump and Musk congratulated each other in a wide-ranging chat, covering topics such as then-Vice President Kamala Harris, how Trump handled the assassination attempt and climate change.

Musk later suggests he's "willing to serve" in government. The Tesla CEO posted an image of himself on X as a representative of DOGE, an acronym for the Department of Government Efficiency.

In early October, Musk appears at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania, where Trump survived the earlier assassination attempt.

Wearing a cap with the "Make America Great Again" slogan of the Trump campaign, Musk said Trump was the only candidate "to preserve democracy in America."

Public displays of alignment continue, reinforcing Musk's growing proximity to Trump's political comeback.

After Trump's re-election, Musk is appointed to lead DOGE alongside former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. The department is formed via executive order with a mission to slash federal spending and bureaucracy.

"Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies," Trump said in a statement at the time. 

Ramaswamy would later leave his role as co-lead of DOGE to pursue elected office.

Maye Musk, Elon's mother, later comments that the two "just seem to be having fun."

Two weeks after his election victory, Trump attended a SpaceX "Starship" rocket launch in Texas alongside Musk.

At Trump's inauguration, Musk receives lavish praise from the president: "We have a new star. A star is born. Elon!"

Musk joins Trump's CEO calls, alongside leaders from Amazon, Google, Meta, and others.

Musk begins overseeing aggressive cost-cutting at government agencies. DOGE forces through return-to-office mandates and eliminates some remote-first government programs.

Musk's DOGE team faces backlash after overreaching into agencies like the U.S. Institute of Peace.

In early March, Trump tells members of the Cabinet that they are in charge of the respective agencies and departments they oversee — not Musk. The tech mogul later posts on X that the meeting was "very productive."

Trump turns the White House lawn into a Tesla showroom and defends Musk as the electric vehicle maker incurs a global backlash.

"He's built this great company, and he shouldn't be penalized because he's a patriot," Trump said at the time.

The president also described the cars as "beautiful" and said he would buy one.

Musk pledges to "significantly" reduce his involvement in DOGE over the coming weeks.

Reports emerge of Musk being distracted and over-stretched, fueling concerns among Tesla and SpaceX investors.

At the time of Tesla's first-quarter earnings in April — which missed expectations — the EV maker's shares were down more than 40% over the year so far.

In an interview with CBS News, Musk publicly criticizes Trump's signature tax and spending bill, saying it counters the work he's been doing to reduce wasteful government spending.

"I was, like, disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decrease it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing," he said.

Trump responded to the critique by saying he wasn't happy with certain aspects of the bill, "but I'm thrilled by other aspects of it. That's the way they go."

One day after airing his criticism of Trump's bill, Musk leaves the White House. He thanks the president for the opportunity to run DOGE.

Trump holds a farewell event for Musk, commending his work in government but says he is "not really leaving" and will occasionally return to the White House because DOGE is his "baby."

Musk lashes out further at Trump's spending bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination" that will explode federal budget deficits. "Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it," Musk said on X.

The criticism quickly escalates into an all-out online brawl between Trump and Musk, with the pair trading barbs over the course of several hours.

The U.S. president threatened to pull back billions of dollars in government contracts for Musk's companies, while the Tesla CEO suggested Trump could not have won the election without him.

"Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore," Trump said.

Developments from the White House are growing more exciting and unpredictable than those 1,000-episode Asian drama serials.

On Thursday, "So much for being Mr. NICE GUY" Donald Trump reverted to being a nice guy and had a "very good call," in his words, with Chinese president Xi Jinping over trade issues. Following the call, Trump said that officials from both countries will meet to negotiate further. Trump had previously described the process of reaching an agreement with Xi as "extremely hard," while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that talks between the U.S. and China are "a bit stalled," which makes the positive outcome of the call even more of a breakthrough.

But Trump's no longer playing nice with Elon Musk. Just last Friday, the U.S. president at a farewell ceremony to Musk's role at DOGE called the latter "terrific" and said "he will, always, be with us." Starting from the weekend, however, Musk began blasting Trump's "big, beautiful bill," which on Thursday culminated in a public spat between the former compatriots in the White House. Trump acknowledged Thursday that "Elon and I had a great relationship" — note the use of the past tense — but he doesn't know "if we will anymore."  

Unlike the twists and turns of a television series, however, the White House's relationships with others — a drama equally or more entertaining than fiction to some — have concrete effects on the economy and markets. Tesla's shares, for instance, tanked 14% after its CEO feuded with the U.S. President. A viewer cannot be completely absorbed, lest, in losing themselves in the spectacle, they lose their investments as well.

Ugly spat between Trump and Musk U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday called Tesla CEO Elon Musk "CRAZY" and threatened to cut his companies' government contracts as the two men feuded over a major tax bill. In response, Musk said Space X will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft "immediately." "Without me, Trump would have lost the election," Musk added later. Shares of Tesla sank more than 14% and shed $152 billion in value from the electric vehicle maker.

Trump talks to Xi on tradeTrump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Thursday had a "very good call" for about 90 minutes which focused "almost entirely" on trade, Trump wrote on Truth Social. He added that U.S. and China officials will meet soon for more talks to resolve an ongoing trade war. Beijing's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and China's embassy in the U.S. said earlier Thursday that Trump had requested the call with Xi.

U.S. markets dragged down by TeslaU.S. stocks fell Thursday, weighed down by Tesla shares tanking. The S&P 500 retreated 0.53%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.25% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.83%. But Microsoft's stocks climbed 0.8% to hit a record and reclaim the title of the world's largest company by market capitalization. Asia-Pacific markets were mixed Friday. India's Nifty 50 was up by 0.95% at 1:45 p.m. in Singapore after the country's central bank slashed interest rates. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, however, slipped 0.4%.

India's central bank delivers outsized cutThe Reserve Bank of India lowered its benchmark policy rate to 5.5% from 6%, the lowest level since August 2022. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the bank to reduce rates by 25 basis points. The decision comes India reported better-than-expected gross domestic product growth in its fiscal fourth quarter. However, the RBI held its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, marking a sharp slowdown from the 9.2% seen in the previous financial year.

Trump and Musk feud draws reactions from billionaires, politicians and pundits. Here's who said what

Trump and Musk seemed inseparable not so long ago: attending events together, doing joint interviews and showering praises on each other. All that changed overnight.

Billionaire Bill Ackman on Thursday urged Trump and Musk to stop fighting. The two men should "make peace for the benefit of our great country," Ackman said on X.

Tesla bull Ross Gerber, head of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, had harsh words for Musk in a series of X posts, stating that Elon was "now attacking all the people he helped put in power." 

Others in Trump's orbit, such as former senior Trump advisor Steve Bannon, who has clashed with Musk in recent months, were also critical of Musk, saying that Trump should sign an executive order to take control of SpaceX.

Sweden's economy and households are feeling the heat from U.S. trade tariffs, the Scandinavian country's finance minister told CNBC — before the full force of the levies has even come into play.

"Our economy and the public finance are very solid. We have a low debt and we can cope with quite a lot. But eight of 10 Swedes save or invest their money in funds, stock markets and so on. So when ... the market has gone up and down, that has been costly for households," Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson told CNBC Tuesday.

"[U.S. President Donald] Trump is really playing a high stakes here, and it's a game with no winners, really, and it's costly for households, and that makes me sad," she added.

Uncertainty around the U.S.' trade policy has left its mark on Swedish and international financial markets. Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, noted last week that the sharp shifts in U.S. trade and security policy were causing "substantial market movements during the spring and entail greater uncertainty than usual."

Other signs have emerged that the threat of tariffs is affecting the wider Swedish economy, with government data released last week showing the economy shrank 0.2% in the three months to March, on a quarterly basis.

Sweden's finance ministry revised its 2025 and 2026 growth forecasts downwards last month, predicting a 1.8% expansion this year and 2.3% next year, saying tariffs and uncertainty are dampening the country's growth prospects.

"We don't know whether tariffs will end, but the uncertainty and the unpredictability — that hurts our economy," Svantesson told CNBC.

Market volatility is having a significant effect on savers in Sweden, a country renowned for its high level of household savings in investment funds among its 10.5 million population.

The nation has actively encouraged retail savings in capital markets for decades, enabling citizens to invest in shares and investment funds and making the practice far more commonplace than in other European countries, like the U.K.

Assessing the distribution and demographics of savers in Sweden, financial watchdog Finansinspektionen noted in March that savers on the younger and older ends of the spectrum tend to put their money into savings accounts. A larger portion of new savings for middle-aged Swedes is in shares and investment funds, ranging from pension schemes and fixed-income to sustainable and technology-focused funds.

Swedish households held liquid financial savings — assets in bank accounts, funds, shares or other savings that generate a cash return — totaling 268 billion Swedish kronor ($27.8 billion) in 2024, with 138 billion Swedish kronor ($14.3 billion) held in investment funds, Sweden's statistics agency said in March, with the average Swede saving around 1,000 Swedish kronor every month in such funds last year.

At the end of the first quarter of 2025, the total fund assets in Swedish investment funds amounted to 7.75 trillion Swedish kronor, according to the latest data from Sweden's statistics body.

"Eight out of every ten Swedes save in funds, and if mandatory premium pension savings are included, we are all fund savers," the Swedish Investment Fund Association (Fondbolagens förening) — which aims to promote and protect confidence in funds as a savings format — says on its website, describing the country as a "world leader in fund saving."

Trump's announcement in April that he would impose import tariffs on a wide range of trading partners, friend and foe alike, has proven a major source of market and economic uncertainty, and it's making some Swedish fund savers nervous, the association told CNBC.

"Swedish fund savers are used to equity investments going up and down in the short run and have a long investment horizon," Fredrik Pettersson, chief analyst at Fondbolagens förening, told CNBC Wednesday.

"Having said that, in our statistics we can see that in the beginning of this year, until now, active fund savers have sold U.S. funds, and bought European and Swedish funds," he noted.

Morten Lund, Scandinavia chief economist at JPMorgan, told CNBC on Wednesday that Trump tariffs are " having a pretty clear impact on household sentiment" and that this could feed into the wider economy.

"So what we can see is that household confidence has moved around the U.S. election, from being the highest across the developed markets to now it's actually plummeted to being the lowest. So it's been a pretty significant shock, and I think it's fair to say that this is very much related to tariffs uncertainty," he said.

Low household confidence could filter through to consumption, Lund said, judging from the latest growth data.

"We do think that there will be a hit. We did get the first GDP numbers from the first quarter, they declined, and that was a clear disappointment, and based on where the confidence numbers are now, we should also see a pretty weak number here in the current quarter," Lund noted.

Sweden is an export-dependent country: exports amounted to around 55% of the national gross domestic product (GDP) in 2024, according to the country's central bank, making its wider economy vulnerable to tariffs imposed on the EU by President Trump.

The move — and tariffs on other trading partners — was predicated on what Trump sees as unfair trading practices by the bloc, which it denies, and persistent trade deficits that the U.S. runs with the EU.

Trump initially imposed 20% duties on the EU as part of his sweeping "reciprocal tariffs" announced in early April, before slashing the rate to 10% for 90 days on April 9 to give time for both sides to negotiate new trading terms.

The EU and U.S. have been locked in talks to try to reach a trade deal, but Trump said in late May that he was recommending a straight 50% duty on goods coming from the bloc amid stalling negotiations.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen managed to persuade the president to give talks more time but, as things stand, the EU has until July 9 to reach a deal with Washington.

Sweden's largest exports to the U.S. are autos, machinery, pharmaceuticals, paper products and iron, steel — which is now subject to a 50% U.S. import tariff — and iron ore. Most Swedish exports go to other Nordic or European countries, but the U.S. is the third largest single exporting country, the Riksbank notes.

"Of course, we are very dependent on exports," Sweden's finance minister told CNBC's "Europe early Edition."

"With this uncertainty, companies are holding back, waiting for investments, because they don't know what will happen. Will the tariff be 10 or 20%, or something else?" she asked.

Donald Trump and Elon Musk seemed inseparable not so long ago: attending events together, doing joint interviews and showering praises on each other. All that changed overnight.

Trump and Musk traded barbs in a rather public feud, with the U.S. president threatening to pull back billions of dollars in government contracts for Musk's companies, while the Tesla CEO suggested Trump could not have won the election without him.

The hostilities began when Trump lashed out at Musk's criticism of the Republican tax-cut and spending bill, and quickly escalated into an all-out online brawl on Trump's Truth Social and Musk's X, with prominent businessmen, analysts and political names weighing in on the fight. 

Billionaire Bill Ackman on Thursday urged Trump and Musk to stop fighting. The two men should "make peace for the benefit of our country," Ackman said on X.

The founder and chief executive of hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, who had endorsed Trump a few months before the November election, said: "We are much stronger together than apart," with Musk replying: "You're not wrong."

U.S. Congressman Jim Jordan told Fox News' Laura Ingraham on Thursday that he hoped Musk and Trump would reconcile, while defending the budget bill. 

Others in Trump's orbit, such as former senior Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who has clashed with Musk in recent months, were less conciliatory. 

Bannon said on his "War Room Live" show Thursday that Trump should sign an executive order to take control of SpaceX, through a national security mobilization law called the Defense Production Act. 

"The U.S. government should seize it," Bannon said, adding that the administration should strip Musk of his security clearance and suspend all federal contracts to his companies, pending an investigation into him. 

Congressman Thomas Massie, a Republican who has opposed Trump's budget bill and been critical of the president in the past, said on X, "The falling out was inevitable. You don't land rockets backwards or get cars to drive themselves by suffering fools gladly."

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban seemingly endorsed a proposal from Musk, who had polled followers on whether to "create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle."

Former Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang reposted Cuban, later pitching an "Independent '28 presidential primary" with participants including Mark Cuban, Jamie Dimon, and actor Matthew McConaughey. 

In Europe, Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski took aim at Musk over his feud with Trump. Sikorski became embroiled in a public spat with Musk and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in March when he said Ukraine may need an alternative to the Starlink satellite service. Amid a flurry of social media posts, Musk told Warsaw's top diplomat, "Be quiet, small man."

Referencing the previous dispute, Sikorski said in a post on X, "See, big man, politics is harder than you thought."

In an apparent reference to Trump and Musk's online spat, the European Union's former leader on tech Thierry Breton posted an eyes emoji and a popcorn emoji. Breton and Musk have previously clashed on social media.

Eurasia Group's Ian Bremmer said in a post on X that "Trump is more powerful than elon, but far less competent."

Wall Street traders dumped Tesla shares, sending them down over 14%, wiping out a staggering $152 billion in the EV maker's market value.

Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush said in a research note that the conflict was "jaw dropping and a shock to the market," creating major fear for Tesla investors. 

"Tesla's stock is under major pressure down 15% as investors fear that this Musk/Trump battle will stop their friendship and change the regulatory environment for Tesla on the autonomous front over the coming years under the Trump Administration," Ives said. 

However, Ives added that the spat had not changed Wedbush's bullish view on Tesla, though it "clearly does put a fly in the ointment of the Trump regulatory framework going forward." 

Another Tesla bull, Ross Gerber, head of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, had harsh words for Musk in a series of X posts, stating that Elon was "now attacking all the people he helped put in power." 

"Elon going postal on Trump and tesla stock is getting walloped. Trump will be returning his new tesla and is saying he got musked. All this can't be good for shareholders. But hey, who cares about us," he said in a post. 

Gary Black, Future Fund's Managing Director, who recently said on X that this firm had sold all its Tesla shares, argued that Trump and Elon's feud would put further pressure on the stock, taking aim at Tesla bulls. 

"These same bulls argued for months that the Musk-Trump alliance would streamline the federal process allowing TSLA to secure general unsupervised autonomy license nationally. That prospect is now highly unlikely," he said in an X post. 

David Rosenberg, president and founder of Rosenberg Research believes Musk's SpaceX provides the U.S. a huge lead in space technology and the ongoing feud could thwart that.

"There's a small group of Republicans that are unsure about that for various reasons, and many of them have cited Elon Musk's opposition to that [spending] bill as a reason that they will not vote for it. So the politics of what Musk is doing may actually be the most significant part of that," Rosenberg told CNBC's Squawk Box.

For some, watching Donald Trump and Elon Musk fall out is like watching your favorite power couple break up — and Bill Ackman and Ye really don't want that happening.

The billionaire hedge fund manager and the hip-hop mogul took to X to share their thoughts.

Ackman urged Trump and Musk to reconcile and continue working together.

"I support @realDonaldTrump and @elonmusk and they should make peace for the benefit of our great country. We are much stronger together than apart," Ackman wrote in his post, which is now pinned to the top of his X profile.

I support @realDonaldTrump and @elonmusk and they should make peace for the benefit of our great country. We are much stronger together than apart.

Musk responded to Ackman's post. "You're not wrong," the Tesla CEO wrote.

You're not wrong

Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, took a different approach.

"Broooos please noooooo. We love you both so much," Ye wrote on X, with an emoji of two people hugging.

Broooos please noooooo 🫂 We love you both so much

Musk and Trump's relationship has taken a sharp turn. 

Shortly after Trump was wounded in an assassination attempt at a rally in July, Musk took to X to declare his endorsement of Trump's presidential bid. He later stood by Trump's side at Mar-a-Lago on election night, celebrating his victory.

In November, Trump said Musk would help lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, which was tasked with cutting federal spending.

Early in Trump's second term, Musk was a regular fixture at the White House. At one point, the Tesla CEO brought his son, X Æ A-XII, to the Oval Office.

But in May, Musk began distancing himself from the administration.

Then on Thursday, it all came crashing down: Musk and Trump had a very public falling out, trading barbs on their respective social media platforms.

Musk, who left his role at DOGE last week, took to X to criticize Trump's tax bill in a flurry of posts, branding it the "Big Ugly Spending Bill."

Trump then fired back during a White House event, expressing his disappointment in Musk and dismissing the criticism as a case of "Trump Derangement Syndrome," before turning to Truth Social to defend his tax bill.

Representatives for Ackman and Ye did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider outside regular hours.

Elon Musk's feud with President Donald Trump has officially reached orbit.

Musk said in a post on X Thursday that SpaceX "will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately" in light of Trump's statement that floated canceling the billionaire's government contracts and subsidies.

The SpaceX CEO included a screenshot of Trump's earlier Truth Social post, which said terminating Musk's government contracts would be the "easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars."

Musk walked that decision back around five hours later.

"This is a shame this back and forth. You are both better than this. Cool off and take a step back for a couple days," X user Fab25june wrote on the platform.

"Good advice. Ok, we won't decommission Dragon," Musk said.

SpaceX's Dragon spaceships are used to transport NASA astronauts and supplies to and from the International Space Station.

In a statement to Business Insider, Bethany Stevens, NASA press secretary, said: "NASA will continue to execute upon the President's vision for the future of space. We will continue to work with our industry partners to ensure the President's objectives in space are met."

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The comments came as the feud between the former allies exploded on Thursday, with Trump and Musk publicly trading insults on their respective social media platforms, Truth Social and X.

Musk's government contracts are worth billions, with SpaceX working closely with NASA. SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft, designed to be reusable, can carry up to seven passengers to and from orbit and is the first private spacecraft to transport humans to and from the ISS, the company says.

Since 2020, NASA has relied on SpaceX's Dragon to transport astronauts to and from orbit. The agency, which retired its space shuttle program in 2011, depended on Russian Soyuz spacecraft for crewed missions prior to partnering with SpaceX.

In 2024, NASA announced SpaceX was awarded a $843 million contract to help decommission the ISS by the early 2030s. The plan involved using a larger, super-powered Dragon spaceship to push the ISS out of orbit, eventually landing in a remote part of the ocean. NASA planned to transition to using privately-owned space stations in the future.

Steve Bannon, who served as the White House chief strategist in Trump's first term, said in an interview Thursday that Trump should act immediately in response to Musk's announcement about decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft.

"President Trump tonight should sign an executive order calling for the Defense Production Act," Bannon said, referring to a federal law that grants the president authority to influence or control domestic industry in the name of national defense,"and seize SpaceX tonight before midnight."

Twenty-five minutes of live TV, more than a dozen posts on X, and three posts on Truth Social over the period of five hours (and counting) — that's how the already fractured friendship of Elon Musk and President Donald Trump publicly unraveled on Thursday.

The first signs of trouble began when Musk showed opposition to Trump's spending bill, the "One Big Beautiful Bill," though he never explicitly targeted Trump.

"Shame on those who voted for it," Musk tweeted on Tuesday, referring to Congress members who voted for Trump's tax cut bill.

Trump, for his part, had stayed uncharacteristically mum about Musk's criticism of the bill.

But that all changed on Thursday morning.

Here is a minute-by-minute breakdown of how the relationship between two of the most powerful men on the planet devolved.

Musk began digging up Trump's old posts on what was then Twitter about the deficit, including one from January of 2013.

Wise words https://t.co/6juH1jEjtc

Musk unearthed another old X post by Trump from back in July 2012, presumably as a swipe at the new Republican tax bill that many economists and the congressional Budget Office said would increase the country's deficits.

I couldn't agree more! 🇺🇸🇺🇸 https://t.co/sZ6xgisZEA

Trump responded to Musk's attacks for the first time when answering press questions during a White House event to welcome German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

"And you know Elon's upset because we took the EV mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles," said Trump. "And they're having a hard time, the electric vehicles. And they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy. Elon knew this from the beginning; he knew it from a long time ago."

Trump's comments about Musk continued at the press appearance.

"He knew every aspect of this bill — better than almost anybody —and he never had a problem until right after he left," said Trump. "He said the most beautiful things about me. He hasn't said bad things about me personally, but I'm sure that'll be next. But I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot."

"People leave my administration, and they love us, and then at some point they miss it so badly, and some of them embrace it, and some of them actually become hostile," Trump continued.

"I don't know what it is. It's sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it, but we have it with others, too. They leave and they wake up in the morning, and the glamour's gone. The whole world is different, and they become hostile," he added.

Musk began a whirlwind of tweets soon after, responding in near real time to what Trump said during the press appearance.

"False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!" Musk posed on X.

False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it! https://t.co/V4ztekqd4g

Musk then began a series of tweets directed at the president beyond the bill, including saying that without him, Republicans would have lost.

Such ingratitude

Musk polls his X followers about creating a new political party "that actually represents the 80% in the middle." Mark Cuban quoted the post with three checkmarks.

Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?

Musk gives Trump's bill — known on paper as the "One Big Beautiful Bill" — a new name: "Big Ugly Spending Bill."

Not even those in Congress who had to vote on the Big Ugly Spending Bill had time to read it! https://t.co/mBOQyhQYwX

Trump responds to Musk with two consecutive posts on his own social media platform, Truth Social.

"Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!" Trump wrote.

"The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!" the president continued.

Musk responds to Trump's posts on Truth Social, calling them "such an obvious lie."

Such an obvious lie. So sad. https://t.co/sOu9vqMVfX

A minute later, Musk appeared to dare Trump to cancel government contracts with his companies.

This just gets better and better 🤣🤣Go ahead, make my day … https://t.co/APmy7cV8iL

Musk makes another accusation.

Time to drop the really big bomb:@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.Have a nice day, DJT!

Trump posts on Truth Social again to defend his tax bill.

"I don't mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress," Trump wrote.

"It's a Record Cut in Expenses, $1.6 Trillion Dollars, and the Biggest Tax Cut ever given. If this Bill doesn't pass, there will be a 68% Tax Increase, and things far worse than that. I didn't create this mess, I'm just here to FIX IT," Trump added.

Musk says SpaceX will decommission its Dragon spacecraft "immediately."

SpaceX's Dragon spaceships transport NASA astronauts and supplies to and from the International Space Station. Prior to partnering with SpaceX, the agency depended on Russian Soyuz spacecraft for crewed missions.

Musk says that Trump's tariffs will "cause a recession in the second half of this year."

Some economists have also predicted that Trump's tariffs would hurt the economy, and Trump himself declined to rule out the chances of a recession back in March.

JPMorgan had predicted a 60% chance of a US recession after Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on April 2. The bank adjusted the possibility down to below 50% recently after Trump paused most of his highest tariffs.

Musk retweeted what appears to be a video of Trump partying with Epstein from the 1990s, doubling down on his earlier statement about the Epstein files.

"This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Business Insider in a statement. "The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again."

Representatives for Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

Musk took a softer tone later on Thursday night.

Some five hours after his post about decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft, he walked back the decision in a response to an X user.

"This is a shame this back and forth. You are both better than this. Cool off and take a step back for a couple days," X user Fab25june wrote on the platform.

"Good advice. Ok, we won't decommission Dragon," Musk wrote at 9:20 p.m.

In a separate exchange on X, billionaire investor Bill Ackman encouraged Musk and Trump to make up.

"I support @realDonaldTrump and @elonmusk and they should make peace for the benefit of our great country. We are much stronger together than apart," Ackman wrote.

"You're not wrong," Musk responded at 9:27 p.m.

Why Circle's ‘Super Positive' IPO Could be Bullish for Ethereum: Analysts

Circle's $1.1 billion IPO on Thursday reflected Wall Street's growing interest in stablecoins, but it may also strengthen institutions' conviction toward Ethereum, analysts told Decrypt.

Although Circle issues its USDC stablecoin across more than 40 different networks, more than half of the stablecoin's circulating supply exists on Ethereum, totaling $36.7 billion, according to crypto data provider DefiLlama.

According to Bitwise Senior Investment Strategist Juan Leon, USDC's concentration on Ethereum is primarily based around the network's prominence in decentralized finance, or DeFi. As a result, he told Decrypt that Ethereum should benefit more than other networks if USDC's footprint grows, as Circle rides a new wave of momentum.

“Overall, it's a super positive development for Ethereum and Coinbase,” he said, referring to the San Francisco-based exchange that has a revenue-sharing agreement for USDC with Circle.

“As USDC usage proliferates, that will continue to translate into more liquidity for DeFi and excitement for developers to build on Ethereum,” he added.

On Thursday, Circle shares soared 165% to $83.22 from an IPO price of $31, according to Yahoo Finance. On Friday, the company's stock price continued climbing, hitting $114.50, as of noon Eastern Time, a 38% jump from Friday's closing price. 

Circle derives income from assets backing USDC like U.S. Treasuries. Ethereum was recently trading hands around $2,500, a 3% dip over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

When it comes to Ethereum's competitors, $8 billion worth of USDC has been issued on Solana, representing around 13% of stablecoin's circulating supply. Other Layer-1 networks, including Avalanche, Sui, and Aptos, each hold less than 2% of USDC's circulating supply.

In addition to Ethereum's mainnet, Circle has issued around $10 billion worth of USDC across Ethereum scaling solutions like Polygon and layer-2 networks like Arbitrum and Base, as well as Hyperliquid, the Arbitrum-based network underpinning the decentralized exchange.

Circle's IPO is likely to generate interest in the company's business model, and as investors start evaluating how stablecoins work, Ethereum name is likely to come up as technology powering emergent tech, Gerry O'Shea, head of global market insights at asset manager Hashdex told Decrypt.

“I think this could potentially help generate more attention around Ethereum and other smart contract platforms as investors look to understand the infrastructure that powers stablecoins,” he said. “IPOs bring a lot of attention.”

Spot Ethereum ETFs, which debuted in the U.S. last year, have emerged as a gauge for institutional interest in the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. 

Although the products have generated net inflows over the past eight trading days, Thursday's inflows were relatively subdued at $11 million, compared to a recent peak of $110 million on Tuesday, according to crypto data provider CoinGlass.

A widely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin (BTC) is gearing up for a massive breakout after correcting to the $100,000 level.

In a new strategy session, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 790,900 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is now likely on the verge of breaking through the resistance level at $105,800.

“Bitcoin is about to break back higher, as we've taken all the liquidity and it's quickly being absorbed. These levels should usually be the end of the correction.”

He also says that Bitcoin is exhibiting market strength after retesting the $100,739 level.

“To be honest, after the recent correction on Bitcoin, this is what you'd want to see. A strong bounce back upwards, ETH also climbing back. Good times are ahead.”

Bitcoin is trading for $105,023 at time of writing.

Next up, the analyst says he remains bullish on layer-1 blockchain Sui (SUI), despite the recent major security breach of the Cetus Protocol, a decentralized exchange (DEX) operating on the Sui network.

The analyst says one reason to be bullish on SUI is that the network's total value locked (TVL) is recovering after its decline triggered by the Cetus hack. The TVL is the amount of capital deposited within a protocol's smart contracts and is often used to gauge the health of a crypto ecosystem.

“SUI has continued to show strength. Despite the recent exploit on Cetus, the TVL on SUI is still $1.8 billion and constantly growing. It has run back with 20% since the recent drop. Such a strong signal and such a strong ecosystem.”

SUI is trading for $3.18 at time of writing, up 1.4% in the last 24 hours.

Lastly, the analyst says that the cross-chain messaging protocol Wormhole (W) is showing bullish divergence on the weekly chart.

A bullish divergence, which suggests price will start to increase, occurs when the price of assets records lower lows while indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator indicator, are witnessing higher lows.

“W remains to be one of my portfolio altcoins. They are bringing Dogecoin to Solana as well, as they bridge the memecoin towards the other chain. Secondly, they are the exclusive partner of BlackRock's BUIDL and more partners. Massive bullish divergence.”

Wormhole is trading for $0.07355 at time of writing, down 2.8% in the last 24 hours.

Ethereum has so far underperformed in this market cycle but looks ready to mount a parabolic rally based on analysts' predictions. Crypto analyst Crypto Bullet recently highlighted a bullish pattern on ETH's chart, which provides a bullish outlook for the altcoin. 

Ethereum Eyes $3,300 As Morningstar Candle Pattern Forms

In an X post, Crypto Bullet predicted that Ethereum could rally to $3,300 as a Morningstar Candle pattern forms for the largest altcoin by market cap. This came as he highlighted the bullish monthly close for ETH and alluded to the monthly chart printing this bullish pattern. With this, the analyst expects a significant rally from Ethereum. 

Crypto Bullet noted that Ethereum is now facing tough resistance, but he believes that the $2,500 resistance will be broken. The analyst added that his next target is $3,300. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ash Crypto also provided a bullish analysis for ETH, in which he declared that the Wyckoff accumulation was still in play. 

He remarked that the first major level to reclaim is $3,100, which will be followed by a small correction. Following that, Ash Crypto is confident that ETH will then surge to $4,000, which will initiate an explosive rally. The analyst affirmed that $10,000 is programmed for ETH in this cycle. 

As NewsBTC reported, crypto analyst Crypto GEM recently predicted that Ethereum could rally to $8,000 by next year. Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also highlighted $5,000, $7,000, and $8,500 as the targets for ETH's market structure. 

Meanwhile, just like Ash Crypto, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto is also confident that the altcoin can reach as high as $10,000 in this market cycle. He highlighted a similarity between Ethereum's current price action and that of the 2017 market cycle. 

Ongoing V-Shape Recovery For ETH

In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted an ongoing V-shape recovery for Ethereum. He noted that ETH has kicked off a sharp reversal, forming a classic V-shape structure on the weekly chart. His accompanying chart showed that ETH could rally to as high as $7,600 on this run-up. 

Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto stated that Ethereum is flirting with a breakout. The analyst further noted that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is already breaking out. His accompanying chart showed that ETH could rally to as high as $3,600 on this breakout. He also declared that the fifth time of ETH's move to the MA20 will be a thrust through. The altcoin is expected to break the $2,600 resistance on this move. 

At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $2,450, down almost 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

 Bitcoin manages to shake off a US nonfarm payrolls beat as Trump insists yet again that the Fed begins to cut interest rates — will Chair Jerome Powell listen? 

Key points:

US President Donald Trump switches his focus from Elon Musk to Fed Chair Jerome Powell as he demands interest-rate cuts.

Bitcoin continues its rebound from the Trump-Musk debacle despite strong US employment data.

Liquidity sparks fresh concerns of a downhill BTC price “cascade.”

Bitcoin (BTC) passed $104,000 at the June 6 Wall Street open as strong US labor market data contrasted with fresh calls for interest-rate cuts.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD up 2.5% on the day.

Having recovered from snap losses over the ongoing spat between US President Donald Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, markets digested fresh inflation cues as Trump turned his attention to the Federal Reserve.

“‘Too Late' at the Fed is a disaster!” he wrote in part of the day's posts on Truth Social.

Trump is no stranger to criticism of both Fed policy and Chair Jerome Powell, and has frequently demanded interest-rate cuts in 2025 — something that would benefit risk assets and crypto.

“Europe has had 10 rate cuts, we have had none. Despite him, our Country is doing great,” he continued, referring to Powell.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, markets see little chance of cuts coming before the Fed's September meeting, per data from CME Group's FedWatch Tool, with Trump's full point's worth fully priced out.

The day's nonfarm payrolls data meanwhile appeared to support the Fed's current approach, showing a resilient labor market and thus decreasing the need to lower rates.

An official release from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) confirmed that “total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 139,000 in May, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.2 percent.”

Turning to BTC price action, popular trader TheKingfisher returned to order book liquidity for clues as to market direction.

Earlier, Cointelegraph noted various downside price predictions for the short term, with commentators agreeing that BTC/USD could fall below $100,000.

“This $BTC liquidation map (optical_opti timeframe) reveals a massive cluster of long liquidations between ~99k and 102k,” part of an X post read on the day. 

TheKingfisher added that the resulting “strong imbalance” of bid versus ask liquidity increased the risk of a liquidity cascade downward.

“Normies see support; we see a liquidation trap,” the post summarized.

The Ethereum (ETH) price experienced a significant decline on Thursday, falling over 7% and approaching the $2,400 mark. However, expert analysis suggests that a new bullish trend may soon emerge for the second-largest cryptocurrency. 

Key Metrics Indicate Accumulation By Larger Investors

Market analyst Lark Davis took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to share insights on Ethereum's potential. He noted that various on-chain metrics and market behaviors indicate an impending breakout for the ETH price. 

Notably, Ethereum has been outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) in the second quarter of the year, suggesting growing investor confidence. The recent Pectra upgrade has improved Ethereum's scalability and reduced its inflation rate, making it more attractive to investors. 

Additionally, the expert highlights that with exchange balances hitting seven-year lows and substantial inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), it appears that larger investors are accumulating ETH for the long term.

Despite these bullish indicators, Davis cautioned that not all market participants share this optimistic outlook. Betting markets on Polymarket currently assign only a 27% chance that Ethereum will reach a new all-time high by 2025. 

Critical Support For Ethereum Amid Political Disputes

The broader cryptocurrency market also faced challenges on Thursday, with total market capitalization dropping from $3.30 trillion to approximately $3.12 trillion. Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana (SOL) were among the notable cryptocurrencies experiencing losses, retracing by 3%, 5%, and 6%, respectively.

In a separate but related development, tensions between US President Donald Trump and his former adviser Elon Musk have surfaced, adding to the day's market volatility. 

Trump expressed disappointment over Musk's criticism of a key tax and spending bill from his administration, suggesting that their “great relationship” may be nearing its end. Musk retaliated by accusing Trump of ingratitude, claiming his support was instrumental in Trump's election victory. 

This public dispute has drawn attention to the intersection of US politics and cryptocurrency, a dynamic that market analyst Income Sharks noted in a recent post on Elon Musk's social media site, X. 

The analyst remarked on the swift impact of political conflicts on crypto markets, emphasizing that the Ethereum price has not yet lost critical support levels. 

Income Sharks, in his analysis, identified the $2,390 mark as a crucial support point for the altcoin in the immediate term, which could determine the next upward targets of $3,000 and $4,000.

While trading at $2,406 when writing, Ethereum finds itself well below its all-time high reached during the market's last bullish cycle in 2021. As of now, the altcoin stands 50% below its record of $4,878, according to CoinGecko data.

 In May 2025, FIFA announced the launch of a dedicated layer-1 blockchain utilizing Avalanche's Subnet technology. This transition marks a departure from its previous use of the Algorand blockchain, which had powered FIFA's initial ventures into Web3, including the FIFA  Collect NFT marketplace launched ahead of the 2023 Club World Cup in Saudi Arabia. The new blockchain is designed to serve as the new infrastructure for FIFA's blockchain-based products, such as digital collectibles and games, offering enhanced performance, scalability and user experience.Did you know? FIFA, the global governing body of football, was founded on May 21, 1904, in Paris by seven European nations. Today, it boasts 211 member associations — more than the United Nations — and is headquartered in Zürich, Switzerland.

 There are multiple reasons behind FIFA's pivot from Algorand to building its own blockchain, most of which come down to control, scalability and ecosystem integration.Control over infrastructureUnder its deal with Algorand, FIFA relied on an external protocol to power its digital collectibles. While Algorand offered energy-efficient, low-cost transactions, the ecosystem remained relatively isolated. FIFA's own blockchain gives it full sovereignty over the protocol layer, enabling it to decide how assets are issued, how games integrate and how users interact with its products without being dependent on third-party roadmap decisions.Scalability for global fan eventsFIFA serves a fanbase estimated at over 5 billion people globally, according to the organization's own figures published after the 2022 World Cup.

Solana's most viral app wants to raise $1 billion. But the crypto community isn't completely sold on the pitch.

Listen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pods, Fountain, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.

On Tuesday, a pseudonymous X account claimed that Pump.fun, Solana's breakout memecoin launchpad, would raise $1 billion via an ICO at a $4 billion valuation. The potential deal? Multiple CEX listings, a 10% community airdrop, and maybe even a launch by the end of the month.

The community reaction? Not great.

In this episode, Syncracy Capital's Ryan Watkins joins to break down the backlash, whether the raise makes sense, and what this kind of fundraising says about the current state of crypto.

He discusses:

Greg Kidd to Acquire Controlling Interest in Know Labs and Introduce Bitcoin Treasury Strategy

SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Know Labs, Inc. (NYSE American: KNW (“Know Labs” or the “Company”), a technology innovator specializing in non-invasive health monitoring solutions, today announced that it has entered into an agreement with Goldeneye 1995 LLC (“Buyer”), an affiliate of fintech investor, entrepreneur, and former Ripple Chief Risk Officer, Greg Kidd, to acquire a controlling interest in the Company. Upon the closing of the transaction, Mr. Kidd will become Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company.


Under the terms of the agreement, the Buyer will acquire that number of shares of the Company's common stock obtained by dividing (i) the sum of 1,000 Bitcoin and a cash sum to retire existing debt, redeem outstanding preferred equity and provide additional working capital, by (ii) the per share purchase price of $0.335. The Bitcoin will be employed by the Company's treasury strategy, providing investors with significant economic exposure to this highly attractive digital asset.




“I'm thrilled to deploy a Bitcoin treasury strategy with the support of a forward-looking organization like Know Labs at a time when market and regulatory conditions are particularly favorable,” said Mr. Kidd. “We believe this approach will generate sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value.” Mr. Kidd and his team bring deep expertise in digital assets and, with this deal, will transition their existing Bitcoin yield generation strategy to the public markets.




When the Bitcoin holdings become the principal component of the Company's balance sheet, management will use the multiple of net asset value (“mNAV”) metric to measure the premium (or discount) investors ascribe to the Company's market valuation relative to its Bitcoin holdings. Given a market capitalization of $128 million, the implied entry mNAV multiple is equivalent to 1.22x and the Bitcoin holdings represent 82% of the market capitalization (assuming a price of $105,000 per Bitcoin) at closing.




Founder Ron Erickson will serve as President of a new division that will retain a team of scientists to continue the Company's proprietary diagnostic research. Upon the closing of the transaction, Mr. Erickson will become Vice Chairman of the Board. “Partnering with Greg Kidd marks a pivotal next chapter for Know Labs,” said Mr. Erickson. “We look forward to continuing our research in non-invasive medical technology. Greg's visionary leadership positions Know Labs for a bold future.”




The transaction, which was unanimously approved by the Know Labs Board of Directors, is expected to close in the third quarter of 2025, following the receipt of shareholder approval and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) has filed a civil forfeiture complaint to seize over $7.74 million in cryptocurrency and NFTs, allegedly connected to North Korean money laundering operations.

What Happened: The Justice Department is moving to seize a range of cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins, Bitcoin BTC/USD, NFTs, and Ethereum ETH/USD Name Service domains—stored in self-custody wallets and Binance accounts. These assets are tied to a civil forfeiture complaint filed on June 5 in federal court in Washington, DC.

The DOJ claims that North Korean IT workers, under false identities, earned the crypto while working remotely for blockchain firms. The funds were originally frozen in April 2023 after Sim Hyon Sop, a China-based banker, was indicted for allegedly helping facilitate the money laundering scheme.

The Justice Department alleges that the North Korean IT workers used fake identification documents and other strategies to secure employment in multiple countries. After being paid—often in stablecoins like USDC and Tether—the workers allegedly employed money laundering methods such as chain hopping and converting tokens into NFTs to conceal the source of the funds.

Why It Matters: This development follows a series of incidents involving North Korean IT workers. In May 2025, North Korean operatives were found infiltrating U.S. remote jobs, funneling millions into North Korea's economy. 

Cybersecurity firm DTEX likened North Korea's cybercrime operations to a mafia organization, with Fortune 500 companies exploited to fund North Korea's nuclear program. Earlier in February 2025, North Korea's Lazarus Group was suspected in a $1.4 billion crypto hack on Bybit.

This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

Bitcoin's BTC$104,655.32 broader outlook is constructive, but its short-term prospects remain bleak, according to technical analysis.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value has bounced back to nearly $104,000 from its overnight low of $104.30, alongside positive action in U.S. equity futures.

However, a closer look at the hourly price chart reveals that the bounce is likely a classic breakdown and retest play – the cryptocurrency dove out of a head-and-shoulders pattern on Thursday, signalling a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change, and prices are now revisiting the breakdown point, called the neckline.

This happens because early sellers – those who shorted at the time of the breakdown – are quick to take profits, consistent with the prospect theory of behavioral analysis.

It leads to a bounce that usually runs into fresh selling at the neckline from those who missed the initial breakdown. These fresh shorts lead to the next leg lower.

In other words, BTC is not out of the woods yet, and prices could turn lower from around $104,000, extending the pullback. The immediate support is at $100,000, followed by $95,500. The latter is arrived at by subtracting the height of the H&S pattern from the breakdown point.

On the higher side, a move above $107,000 is needed to invalidate the bearish setup and shift focus to record highs.

May 2025 marks a turning point for the entire Web3 ecosystem. According to the new Dapp Industry Report by DappRadar, we witness a significant recovery in several verticals: DeFi, NFT, and AI show concrete signs of consolidation and growth. 

With 25 million daily active wallets, a 25% growth in DeFi TVL, and a 40% increase in NFT trading volume, the narrative is changing: from cyclical speculations to a concrete, mature, and distributed use of dapps.

Summary

The report highlights how the number of daily active unique wallets (dUAW) increased by 8% compared to April, reaching 25 million. This widespread growth reflects a renewed enthusiasm from users, driven by three main sectors:

We are entering a phase in which DeFi, Gaming, and AI compete for users' attention on an equal basis. A balance that, as highlighted by DappRadar, represents an important sign of maturity for the entire sector.

Among the emerging trends, InfoFi also stands out, the movement that is leading to the “financialization” of data in a Web3 context. A trend that will see more and more users, AI agents, and protocols exchange data, models, and insights as true financial assets, leveraging blockchain and transparency.

If April was dominated by the memecoin mania (Pump.fun above all), in May there was an transition from hype to utility. Some emblematic cases:

In summary, the dapps that are growing the most today are not those based on speculation, but those that solve real problems: from smart communications to scalable decentralized finance, including gaming with persistent identities.

The DeFi has recorded one of the best performances in recent months, with a TVL increasing by 25% bringing the total to about 200 billion dollars. The credit goes partly to the rally of Ethereum (+40%) and Bitcoin (new ATH), but also to significant infrastructural developments.

The most surprising dapp is Hyperliquid, a DEX that has reached a monthly trading volume of $244 billion, capturing 10% of Binance's market share. With these figures, it enters the world's top 5 for trading volume, surpassing numerous centralized exchanges.

DeFi is thus structuring itself as a concrete alternative to the CeFi world, strengthened by technical updates, regulatory clarity, and renewed investor trust.

With 4.8 million daily active users, AI dapps are now reassessing the AI narrative in Web3. SubHub is the most emblematic case, but the report also highlights widespread growth:

According to a Harris poll commissioned by Digital Currency Group:

A data point that strengthens the synergy between Web3 and artificial intelligence: users and investors demand transparency, ownership, and alternatives to tech monopolies.

The NFTs are growing again, with $280 million in volume (+40%) and 2.7 million transactions (+35%). But is it a real recovery or just a temporary spike?

Among the most significant events:

The sector remains partly tied to incentive mechanisms (airdrop and farming), but the signs of an evolution towards utility and mobile scalability are concrete.

Despite fewer incidents compared to April, May saw $275 million lost in just 7 attacks, making it the 3rd worst month of the year.

Security remains one of the main vulnerabilities of the sector. There is a need for more stringent audits, real-time monitoring tools, and greater technical education for developers and users.

The DappRadar report shows a more mature, balanced, and innovative Web3. After turbulent months, the fundamentals are returning to the forefront:

The sector is shifting from volatile experimentation to building robust infrastructure. The future of dapps will be determined by utility, interoperability, scalability, and security.

And as the report highlights: “It is no longer just a matter of hype, but of fundamentals”.

 While Bitcoin ETFs flipped to $278 million of outflows amid the Trump-Musk feud, Ether ETFs saw inflows, continuing a 14-day streak. 

Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States turned red amid worsening sentiment stemming from an ongoing feud between US President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk.

After a brief recovery on June 3-4, US spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs were again hit with outflows on June 5, totaling $278 million, according to SoSoValue data.

The outflows came as the Cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index flipped from “Greed” to “Fear” on June 6, likely in response to the rupture of the previously close relationship between Trump and Musk, which has played out in multiple explosive social media posts.

The sentiment shift is not exclusive to Bitcoin and crypto, with many investors spooked by the feud. Tesla (TSLA) shares plunged 14%, while Trump Media (DJT) shares dropped 8%, according to TradingView.

The latest outflows from US spot Bitcoin ETFs followed a two-day recovery coming after a series of outflows from May 29 to June 2, totaling $1.2 billion in just three trading days.

Global Bitcoin exchange-traded products have seen $8 million of outflows in the past trading week, while Ether (ETH) ETPs topped inflows at $321 million.

According to SoSoValue, ARK Invest's ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF(ARKB) led the exodus on June 5 with a massive $102 million in outflows. None of the funds saw inflows on that day.

While Bitcoin ETFs flipped to outflows amid the Trump-Musk feud, Ether ETFs continued to see inflows on Thursday.

According to SoSoValue, US spot Ether ETFs saw $11.3 million of inflows on June 5, marking 14 consecutive days of inflows. Still, yesterday's inflows were a noteworthy drop from $56.9 million of inflows on June 4 and $109.4 million of inflows on June 3.

Ether ETPs have attracted attention amid improving network fundamentals and resilient ETH futures markets.

BlackRock — the world's largest crypto ETF issuer — purchased $50 million worth of Ether on June 3, according to the blockchain analytics platform Arkham.

Quiet on set, people!" said Brock Pierce, the former child actor who grew up to be a prominent cryptocurrency entrepreneur. A hundred or so people sat in various states of conversation and intoxication at a Las Vegas Maggiano's that DNA Fund, a Pierce-founded venture, had rented out for several days during the official Bitcoin 2025 Conference last week.

We had just heard a bizarre speech from New York City's mayor, Eric Adams, who said Pierce and his colleagues in crypto were "pioneers" like Betsy Ross, who became a historical icon for stitching the first American flag featuring stars and stripes.

"So although the rockets' red glare and bombs burst in air, they proved through the night that our flag is still there," said Adams. "That is who you are. You are the best." Adams promised to start a crypto council for New York and to issue bitcoin bonds. He talked about how there's illegality with credit cards and fraud with the stock market. "Let's stop the bullshit and let's open doors," he said.

As Pierce again called for quiet on set, the volume of the banquet room chatter came down only slightly, as the assembled guests — crypto hustlers, bitcoin true believers, fintech founders, and a few journalists — realized that the end of the restaurant's main dining room had been quickly turned into a set for "CryptoKnights," the "Shark Tank"-for-web3 show that Pierce hosts alongside the former "Entourage" star Adrian Grenier on Amazon Prime. At Maggiano's, Pierce had assembled a panel of judges: Grenier was absent, but there were familiar reality-show archetypes in the form of a beautiful woman and a well-muscled Chad alongside Pierce, who was outfitted in a feathered panama hat. Soon they began filming. An aspiring crypto entrepreneur made his pitch — a way to earn yield on bitcoin — but after a few minutes of back-and-forth, Pierce and the judges shot him down. His product was only a concept. Not ready for prime time.

After the show, attendees enjoyed a three-course Maggiano's meal of family-style Italian staples. Pierce, a former business partner of Steve Bannon whose recent headlines tend to center on lawsuits over a hotel in Puerto Rico and his friendship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's son Yair, held court in a corner of the restaurant where Adams was also entertaining guests. Earlier that day, Pierce had hosted a fundraising luncheon with Adams, "Lunch With America's Bitcoin Mayor."

With some 35,000 attendees, the Bitcoin Conference at the Venetian hotel is the world's largest gathering in crypto. At the conference, officially put on by Bitcoin Magazine, the parties and side meetings like DNA Fund's romps at Maggiano's could be just as consequential as the main event, and they sometimes featured the same speakers. Adams, the Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, the anti-death guru Bryan Johnson, and the recently pardoned crypto executive Arthur Hayes all did double duty, appearing at the Venetian and at the Maggiano's confab down the road.

For entrepreneurs like Pierce, where life is a constant montage of networking, dealmaking, and self-publicizing via social media, it was just another day. DNA House has hosted events around the world, trailing large crypto gatherings in Toronto and the United Arab Emirates. And for many of his guests, gorging on wagyu beef stuffed shells and truffle mac and cheese, it was much the same: another alcohol-soaked party in a week filled with them, as the bitcoin faithful celebrated their ascendant political power.

More than anything, Bitcoin 2025 was a victory celebration for an industry that pushed all its chips in behind Donald Trump and the Republican Party during the 2024 election cycle and won handsomely. The first day, which was dubbed Code and Country, was so replete with Republican politicians, Trump staffers, and chest-thumping executives that it might've been mistaken for CPAC. Sponsored by America250, an ostensibly nonpartisan 501(c)(3) charged with planning the events making up the government's official 250th birthday celebration, the Code and Country program ended up revealing a lot about bitcoin's evolving position in American politics.

Bitcoin's adherents still tout foundational ideas like decentralization and a libertarian exit from society, but the MAGA and big-money tilt are unmistakable. As I saw on full and often surreal display over three days and nights in Vegas, the immediate future of bitcoin lies in the cryptocurrency industry's tight alignment with Trump, and its growth is now dependent on its adoption by large corporations, union retirement funds, the federal government, and a handful of billionaires racing to acquire as much of the stuff as they can.

Bitcoiners have always leaned right — challenging the state's monopoly on issuing money can do that — but it was a broadly libertarian right that included latter-day digital goldbugs, hard-money obsessives, anti-state sovereign citizens, and cypherpunks seeking some kind of supranational independence protected by the mathematical magic of encryption. The US president was not envisioned to be among this crew, and Trump famously denounced bitcoin as a "scam" during his first term.

But bitcoin's role in the world has changed dramatically in the 16-plus years since the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto published a proposal for a peer-to-peer currency. Whole industries and vast political and criminal networks have grown up around bitcoin. During the conference, the value of a single token reached an all-time high of more than $111,000. For the Republican Party, bitcoin has become a proxy for freedom and a way of activating a motivated donor base that has already yielded major electoral gains.

As real money flooded into bitcoin, the cypherpunks were superseded by venture capitalists, money launderers, authoritarian tech billionaires, and a broad swath of the MAGA movement that saw bitcoin's general anti-government orientation as consistent with Trumpian populism. Many of them also saw it as a way to get rich. But the transformation of bitcoin's $2 trillion political economy has mostly left everyday retail traders behind. Even as bitcoin has soared in value, trading volume on exchanges has plummeted since its 2021 highs. It remains little used as a currency, with El Salvador, the one country to officially adopt bitcoin as a currency, scaling back its project.

In the 2024 election cycle, bitcoin's overwhelming partisan shift became impossible to ignore when the crypto industry raised more than $200 million to support Trump and a slate of largely Republican candidates. In return, the industry has seen the dismantling of crypto crime task forces across federal agencies; the loosening of financial regulation; the pardoning of the Silk Road drug market's founder, Ross Ulbricht; a reshuffling at the Securities and Exchange Commission; the veritable dismantlement of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; an end to most federal lawsuits and prosecutions against major crypto companies and individuals; the establishment of a national crypto stockpile that has the potential to buoy token prices; and, perhaps more surprisingly, the emergence of President Donald Trump as the country's most powerful crypto entrepreneur.

It's a dizzying turnabout for an industry that, last year, described itself as constantly on the defensive against a Democratic administration and regulatory state that it thought was bent on destroying it. Now, the main headache for many crypto CEOs isn't former SEC Chair Gary Gensler or Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Instead they must contend with the president himself, who, with his growing portfolio of crypto companies, has brought some unwelcome attention to an industry trying to force through Congress a friendly regulatory framework for dollar-pegged stablecoins — another business in which Trump has lately become involved.

Still, the Trumpian drama is worth it when the president has promised to give them the regulatory regime they want. Trump has pardoned a number of financial fraudsters and crypto executives, some of whom were feted in Vegas.

In Vegas, especially on the opening Code and Country day, the general feeling was of a gray-market industry being welcomed into the light and handed unprecedented influence. The sheer influx of Republican politicians spoke to that, with pro-crypto stalwarts like Sen. Cynthia Lummis, Rep. Tom Emmer, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Sen. Jim Justice, and Rep. Byron Donalds among many party notables appearing on panels. Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. had their turns on the main stage ("I truly believe we're just at the beginning. Opportunity abounds," said Trump Jr.), as did the White House crypto and AI czar David Sacks, the Trump advisor and campaign cochair Chris LaCivita, and the White House crypto advisor Bo Hines. On Wednesday, Vice President JD Vance, a former venture capitalist, gave the day's opening keynote to a full crowd that began assembling at 5:30 a.m.

"Thanks in particular for what you did for me and the president," said Vance, explaining that the crypto industry's support was "part of the reason I'm standing here." He added: "With President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House."

"The innovators in this room are making people's lives better. You deserve respect and support from your government, not bureaucrats trying to tear you down," said Vance, to vigorous applause.

Bitcoin-themed Trump apparel was everywhere. Vendors sold Trump 2028 hats and posters of a hardened-looking Trump covered in bitcoin iconography. With crypto having just come in from the political cold, there was an undertone of subversion to it all. Someone wore a T-shirt that read "Everything I love to do is illegal." Another wore an ivory white suit decorated with the word TEXIT, in support of a Texas secession movement. A company called BitcoinOS was offering a lottery to win a foreign passport — probably from Portugal, though it wasn't yet decided. A number of accountants and financial advisors on the conference floor peddled tax-mitigation strategies, with the sign from Tax Network USA offering the brazen solicitation: "Ask Us About Tax Avoidance."

As Trump opened his second administration by pardoning convicted fraudsters while several SEC cases were put on hold, some crypto billionaires found it safe to visit the United States. The Bitcoin 2025 conference featured an appearance by one of those crypto entrepreneurs who had recently benefited from the SEC declining to pursue a multibillion-dollar fraud case it had prepared against him. Tron's founder, Justin Sun, a Chinese crypto billionaire, became the biggest investor in Trump's World Liberty Financial and the largest purchaser of the $Trump meme coin, which earned him a gold watch at Trump's recent gala for the top 220 owners of his token. A peripatetic executive who lives in Hong Kong and claims citizenship from St. Kitts & Nevis (he's also the prime minister of an unrecognized country called Liberland), Sun hadn't been seen in the US in years. But there he was at Bitcoin 2025, where he was applauded on the main stage and photographed with industry figures.

Equally feted was Paolo Ardoino, the CEO of Tether, the world's largest stablecoin company, which operated in Hong Kong and the Caribbean for years before recently moving its headquarters to crypto-and-MAGA-friendly El Salvador. Ardoino gave a keynote speech and participated in a fireside chat on the main stage with Brandon Lutnick, the Cantor Fitzgerald executive who handles Tether's accounts, a position he inherited from his father, Howard Lutnick, Trump's commerce secretary.

"This year is your first time in the US," said Brandon Lutnick, more than once. Ardoino nodded. No one bothered to mention why Ardoino, who's 41, had never been to the States: His company had already reached multiple settlements with US regulators, and Ardoino and his colleagues were reportedly being investigated by the Department of Justice on suspicion of violating sanctions and anti-money-laundering rules, along with possible bank fraud (Ardoino said last year that he didn't think Tether was under criminal investigation). Before Trump's reelection, setting foot in the United States might have been a quick way for Ardoino to earn an interview with the FBI. Now, he and Sun were sought-after celebrities.

It wasn't just crypto's quasi-outlaw kingpins who were embracing a newfound freedom. Several speakers said that they had expected to be in jail this year — for what reasons, they didn't specify. The implication was less that they were operating on the margins of the law than that they were victims of government oppression — which only Trump could stop.

"Tyler, I think you mentioned that a year before that you thought it was much more likely that you'd be in the jailhouse than the White House," the cryptocurrency billionaire Cameron Winklevoss told his twin brother during a panel with David Sacks.

"I think the president appreciated that," said Sacks. "He similarly was facing lawfare a year ago, when his political enemies were trying to put him in prison for 700 years. I think he really understood the plight of the crypto community because they were being subjected to the same kind of unfair persecution that he was."

That night, America250 hosted a party at a pool club in the Resorts World Las Vegas complex. Companies like Exodus, Frax, Kraken, Coinbase, and Justin Sun's Tron were listed as sponsors. As guests walked in, a disembodied gloved hand reached through a black curtain, offering a complimentary flute of Champagne. The open bar provided generous pours, and the bathroom attendants had free Zyn. Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, the legendary hip-hop group, came out for a performance. Rosie Rios, the chair of America250 who, on a conference panel that day, described herself as a "fiscal conservative," bobbed her head as they rapped about blunts and rum. The goldbug Peter Schiff, who, while facing tax and money laundering investigations over his private bank in Puerto Rico, has made a sideline out of media appearances sparring with bitcoiners, sat on a couch surrounded by a retinue of young women. Bottles of iced Moët rested on tables in poolside cabanas. (Schiff, who sued the IRS, has accused government authorities of conspiring to frame his bank.)

Bone Thugs transitioned into their song "1st of Tha Month" — a gold-charting, mid-'90s anthem celebrating the date when welfare checks arrive — as a group of women in cow costumes marched out carrying glowing signs that read "Steak 'n Shake" and "Accepts BTC." Above the stage, a large screen lit up with the Steak 'n Shake logo. A half-dozen suited Steak 'n Shake representatives looked on approvingly from behind a velvet rope.

This sort of hallucinatory marketing stunt — part of Steak 'n Shake's ongoing MAGA/MAHA pivot, as the fast-food chain embraces beef tallow and bitcoin — was essentially standard fare for a week filled with constant offers, giveaways, pop culture callouts, and promises of easy riches and financial liberation. Everyone was hustling, selling, promising the world. "Earn Bitcoin While You Sleep," went a pitch from a mining company handing out branded fedoras. "Unlock Passive Income." The built environment, including some people's clothing and the napkins on tables, seemed overrun with QR codes. There was always another bitcoin raffle to enter or party to seek out, and the difference between what was legitimate and what wasn't could be a matter of interpretation.

The next night, at a wood-paneled bar on the 66th floor of the Conrad hotel, a crypto mining company called Digital Shovel threw a party with Maxim, the old lad mag. The names of both brands were printed across a blue curtain, in front of which guests and models hired from a local agency took photos. Asked about the role of Maxim in this venture, Scot Johnson, the president and CEO of Digital Shovel, told a group of journalists that he had rented the brand name for the evening.

Later, I ended up at a party for the Taproot Wizards, a kind of low-fi, deliberately unserious group of coiners who wish to "make bitcoin magical again." Walking into the psychedelically lit Discoshow venue at the Linq Hotel, I was handed a shiny silver wizard hat and cape, which I duly put on. A bearded man in full mage garb held out his hand, offering what looked like a brown capsule.

"Take it," he said.

"What is it?" I asked.

"It's drugs."

"Can I know which kind?"

"It's mushrooms."

I took it and enjoyed what seemed like the suspiciously familiar taste of a brown M&M.

Inside, the bar served free cocktails and cans of Liquid Death water. A few dozen people milled about in wizard clothes, the place emanating a "D&D fans throw a party" vibe. A handful of folks danced to a DJ set in a room so covered in screens and glowing panels that there was a seizure warning by the entrance. There was goofiness and some networking-free fun. No one seemed to be talking about bitcoin. And unfortunately, it was just an M&M.

In Vegas, the future of bitcoin was corporate. "Bitcoin treasury companies," publicly traded corporations that are essentially holding vehicles for accumulating bitcoin, were all the rage, as several CEOs took turns paying tribute to Michael Saylor, the tech executive who has borrowed billions of dollars to turn turn his enterprise software company MicroStrategy into one of the world's largest holders of bitcoin. Saylor has encouraged other companies to adopt his "playbook," and GameStop and Trump Media recently announced that they would follow suit. Nakamoto, the company whose name sat atop most Bitcoin 2025 conference branding and signage, is a bitcoin treasury company headed by David Bailey, the principal figure behind the conference.

In panel presentations, CEOs described future markets in which most companies would have bitcoin on their books, if not being explicitly devoted to it. Financial institutions and individual investors could then buy shares in those companies, like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet, which are publicly traded, and benefit from those companies' bitcoin exposure, broadening the circle of prosperity. A similar philosophy undergirded the growing adoption of ETFs, Wall Street funds that provide investors exposure to bitcoin without making customers go through the trouble of purchasing actual bitcoins. (These financial firms, in turn, benefit from the fees they reap from managing investments in ETFs, bitcoin treasury companies, and other crypto-based financial products.)

"At the end of the day, it's a game and we're all going to win together," said Fold CEO Will Reeves, whose company had recently begun building its bitcoin treasury.

"We're going to be the biggest companies in the world," said Simon Gerovich, the president of Metaplanet.

Saylor, the silver-haired 60-year-old executive whose self-described "religious" embrace of bitcoin has catalyzed this corporate treasury movement, was one of the conference's chief draws. His keynote, on the event's third and final day, was standing-room only. Wearing all black except for a silver bitcoin pendant that hung below his throat, Saylor emerged to rock-star-level applause. Speaking in his typically craggy voice, he preached a post-cypherpunk prosperity gospel under the unassuming title "21 Ways to Wealth." Acknowledging that he was used to speaking to top corporate executives and politicians, Saylor said he was happy to now be speaking to the people, bringing them the digital fire of Prometheus.

"Satoshi gave you an idea worth half of everything on earth," said Saylor. "The greatest idea in the history of the human race."

Scrolling through 21 instructive axioms — "master artificial intelligence," "domicile where sovereignty respects your freedom" — each accompanied by an AI-generated image, Saylor told his audience not to "chase your own good ideas." Only one pursuit mattered. Everyone listening should sell or mortgage everything they have, take out loans upon loans, and use it all to buy as much bitcoin as they could as quickly as possible. "Raise and reinvest capital relentlessly — velocity compounds wealth," read one slide. Saylor described how a dentist whose practice brought in a couple of hundred thousand dollars in annual revenue could theoretically — through a series of corporate maneuvers, loans, share sales, and lines of credit — become a bitcoin billionaire. Why aspire to be merely rich when you could be the "first billionaire dentist on your block," he said.

A constant on the bitcoin media circuit, Saylor talks in comically overwrought tones about bitcoin's power and perfection. He exhibits the personal commitment and persuasive abilities of the leader of a sophisticated multi-level marketing scheme. Over the past few years, Saylor has raised billions of dollars in debt to make periodic bitcoin purchases, MicroStrategy's stock has soared, and his once criticized thesis of constant corporate bitcoin accumulation is on the verge of being widely imitated. (Last year, Saylor agreed to pay $40 million to settle a tax fraud lawsuit filed by the Washington, DC, attorney general.)

"This is a race to capitalize on bitcoin," Saylor said, sounding far more zero-sum than the we're-all-going-to-win CEOs who had praised him hours earlier. "He who has the most bitcoin at the end of the game wins." The crowd cheered.

Ross Ulbricht, the speaker who followed Saylor, had attained practically mythological status among diehard bitcoiners. One of the first major dark web drug markets and a transformational event in bitcoin's history, the Silk Road provided it a clear use case: buying drugs online. As one former Silk Road customer turned crypto industry professional once told me, the Silk Road was the greatest onboarding event in bitcoin history. For years after Ulbricht received multiple life sentences without parole, coiners had lobbied for his release, until Trump pardoned him on January 21 of this year.

After an introductory video chronicling his years in prison followed by shots of him surfing, swimming, and diving into waterfalls, Ulbricht came out to warm applause. But the crowd had thinned since Saylor's commanding speech — some chairs sat empty — and would get thinner as Ulbricht went on. He tried to rouse the audience with a cry of "Freedom!" and a raised fist.

"I'm so, so thankful that we elected him and he is who he is," Ulbricht said of Trump. "He's a man of integrity."

However foundational Ulbricht had been to bitcoin's early growth, the movement seemed to have passed him by. In his speech, he acknowledged starting the Silk Road but said almost nothing about why he went to prison, the drug war, or the flawed criminal justice system (some Silk Road investigators were prosecuted for stealing evidence). There were some general appeals to principle, but it was a stilted, overlong presentation by a figurehead who seemed to have been far more appreciated when he was locked up out of view.

Ulbricht offered a stem-winding anecdote about renting a secluded cabin, where he planned to grow magic mushrooms for his nascent drug market. He found the cabin covered in seven wasp nests. The wasps reflected some of Ulbricht's most treasured principles — freedom and decentralization. But they lacked another, unity, which made it easy for him to destroy each nest in turn. What kind of unity Ulbricht was looking for wasn't clear.

No one seemed as jazzed about Ulbricht's stoic devotion to decentralization as they did about Saylor promising to share the everlasting cyberfire of half the world's wealth. The conference's closing keynote — an appearance by the bitcoin political cause celebre, on the 10th anniversary of his being sentenced to a lifetime in prison — ended with tepid applause and a rush to the exits. In a week of politically infused celebrations, this was supposed to be Ulbricht's moment. There had been a special lunch for him that day, one of many fundraisers since his release. The conference included the auctioning of his prison art and the jumpsuit he wore on the day of his release. "Free Ross," a mantra that had been printed on stickers handed out at every bitcoin event for a decade, had won. But bitcoin's top political prisoner, its once occluded hero, had bored a crowd with abstract talk of freedom and insects.

That night, I went to another bitcoin-related party at a nightclub in the Venetian. A healthcare recruiter in her late 40s named Jen, who lived in Atlanta, told me about converting her retirement account to bitcoin tokens and shares in bitcoin ETFs. A DJ played some recent hits while a mix of middle-aged coiners and Gen Z club kids swayed and pawed at each other's bodies. Some women in gravity-defying dresses danced on an elevated bar while velvet ropes denoted exclusive areas, where tables could run a couple of thousand dollars.

"I've had such a hard time orange-pilling my friends," she told me. But her bitcoin investments had gone up 140% in the past year. Wasn't that proof of something? She asked if I had done the same. I gave a halting answer about not investing in what I write about and not really having much of a retirement account anyway. She looked at me as if I were from another planet before her face adopted a look of profound concern.

"You have to do it."

I said I would.

SUI, one of the leading altcoins of this cycle, has recorded an impressive price recovery over the past two months. However, as the cryptocurrency fails to hold some key levels, some analysts warn of a potential drop below the $3.00 support.

SUI Rally Risks Massive Price Drop

Since hitting its four-month high of $4.29, SUI's price has been moving sideways, hovering between $3.40-$4.00 throughout most of May. Amid last week's market retrace, the altcoin recorded a 14.2% price drop, losing its range and hitting the $3.00 support over the weekend.

At the start of this week, SUI saw a mild recovery alongside the rest of the market, surging to the $3.20 area. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency has failed to hold this level over the past 24 hours and dropped to the $3.10-$3.15 area on Thursday morning.

Crypto analyst Carl Runefelt warned that the cryptocurrency's rally could be in danger as it risks breaking down of a descending triangle pattern.

Per the post, the altcoin has been trading within this formation for the past month, also displaying a potential Head & Shoulders setup forming inside of the triangle, and the pattern's baseline sitting around the $3.10 support.

To the analyst, “if it breaks out of this triangle to the downside, then the fall can be very hard,” forecasting a nearly 35% retrace toward the $2.00 mark. On the contrary, a breakout to the upside could propel SUI's price toward the $4.20 resistance.

Analyst Crypto Bullet recently highlighted a “humongous” rising wedge pattern in the cryptocurrency's chart, which eyes the $8-$10 area as the next major target. According to the chart, SUI has been moving within this pattern since early 2024, hovering between the upper and lower boundaries for over a year.

Notably, the cryptocurrency hit the support trendline one more time during the April low, bouncing from this level. Based on this, the analyst considers that the current dip could be “the last opportunity to add to your bags before SUI makes a new ATH.”

Can It Repeat Its Late 2024 Playbook?

Analyst Rekt Capital noted that SUI was positioned for a bullish Monthly Candle Close in May, aiming to replicate its late 2024 performance. Last year, the cryptocurrency retested the $3.39 level and turned it into support, which acted as a springboard toward its January 2025 all-time high (ATH) of $5.35.

This time, May closed below this crucial level, failing to confirm it as support and losing the recent price range. SUI is now “showcasing very early signs of upside wicking into said level to turn it into new resistance.”

The analyst warned that June could see the cryptocurrency reject from this level “if things don't change over the course of this month.” SUI is currently located inside the $2.33-$3.39 price range and is trying to position itself for a reclaim of the Range High to facilitate a breakout.

However, it has unsuccessfully attempted to surge to that level, which could send the price toward lower levels if it “continues to float here without covering additional ground.”

Therefore, SUI risks dropping 10% toward the $2.81 mid-range area, which acted as support and weak resistance earlier this year, and falling 30% to the $2.33 range low if the previous level doesn't hold.

“If SUI fails to show signs of reclaiming $3.39 as support (at least on the Daily timeframe via Daily Closes above $3.39), then sub-$3 regions could be on the cards,” the analyst concluded.

As of this writing, SUI trades at $3.08, a 2.3% decline in the daily timeframe.

A late-night Twitter spat between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk sparked fresh uncertainty in global markets, sending major cryptocurrencies tumbling and wiping out nearly $1 billion in leveraged bets.

Bitcoin BTC$104,655.32 dropped below $101,000 overnight before bouncing modestly, with DOGE and ADA among the worst hit, down over 6% each in the past 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which tracks the largest crypto assets, shed over 5%.

Data from CoinGlass shows that traders lost $988 million in liquidations — of which $888 million were long positions — indicative of a wipeout in bullish positions.

Exchanges like Bybit and Binance saw the biggest hits, with Bybit alone accounting for nearly $354 million in liquidations.

The liquidations largely hit major tokens, with bitcoin leading the pack at over $342 million liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data.

Ether ETH$2,492.51 followed with $286 million, reflecting the sharp sell-offs across the broader market.

Other tokens like Solana's SOL$149.84 and Dogecoin DOGE$0.17965 saw $51 million and $27 million liquidated, respectively, as altcoin traders found themselves on the wrong side of the sudden downturn.

XRP XRP$2.18 wasn't spared either, with $23 million in positions wiped out. The data also shows that high-leverage plays on memecoins, such as 1000PEPE, added to the volatility, as traders rushed to exit.

Liquidations to the forced closure of a trader's leveraged position when they can no longer meet the margin requirements. This typically occurs when the price of the underlying asset moves against their position, causing them to lose a large portion, or all, of their initial investment.

A cascade of liquidations often indicates market extremes, where a price reversal could be imminent as market sentiment overshoots in one direction.

The sell-off comes as Trump accused Musk of going “crazy” and threatened to terminate government contracts with his companies, while Musk lashed back by linking Trump to Jeffrey Epstein's files. 

The clash overshadowed what had been a mostly bullish trend for crypto markets in recent weeks, intensifying a profit-taking bout from the start of this week.

You've probably heard the phrase NFT royalties thrown around like digital confetti, but what does it actually mean? Think of it like this: every time someone resells a piece of digital art, music, or collectible you created, you get a little slice of the pie—automatically. No chasing people down, no paperwork, just sweet, passive income landing in your crypto wallet.

That's the dream, right? Create something once, and get paid again and again every time it changes hands. For digital creators, this sounds like the holy grail of internet art: work less, earn more.

But here's the million-dollar (or at least million-satoshi) question: Can NFT royalties really be trusted to keep the cash—or crypto—flowing forever? Or is this all just a digital daydream waiting to fade out with the next bear market?

Let's dig in.

Okay, time to peek behind the curtain: how do NFT royalties actually work? Is there a magical robot accountant keeping tabs on resales and sending out crypto coins? Kinda.

At the heart of it all are smart contracts—basically, bits of code that live on the blockchain and do exactly what they're told, no questions asked. When you create an NFT and list it for sale, you can embed a rule in the smart contract that says, “Hey, every time this NFT is resold, send me 5% (or whatever percentage I choose).” It's like setting up a tip jar that automatically refills itself every time someone else gets their hands on your art.

Most creators set royalties between 2.5% and 10%, depending on the platform and how bold they're feeling. Want to keep it chill? Go low. Feeling spicy? Ask for more. The cool thing is, this cut gets taken out of each secondary sale and sent straight to your wallet—no middlemen, no awkward payment reminders.

Now, not all NFT marketplaces are created equal. Some are super royalty-friendly. Platforms like OpenSea, Rarible, and Foundation let creators bake in their royalties right from the start. These platforms are basically like your chill artist friends who always split the check fairly.

But here's the twist (you knew there'd be one): just because you set royalties doesn't mean every platform honors them. Some newer marketplaces have started skipping out on royalty payments to attract sellers and buyers with lower fees—which has sparked quite the drama in NFT town. (More on that tea later.)

So yes, NFT royalties are a pretty neat system—at least in theory. But is it all smooth sailing from here? Not quite.

Let's talk about why NFT royalties have artists doing virtual backflips.

Traditionally, when you sold a piece of art, that was it. You got paid once, and if that art resold later for millions? You'd get… nada. NFT royalties flipped that script.

Think of it like Spotify royalties, but without a million middlemen taking a cut.

Royalties give creators more than just money—they offer independence. Artists, musicians, photographers, and even meme makers can now:

This is a big deal in the digital economy. For once, the internet is helping creators keep ownership of their art and their income.

A few examples of NFT royalty magic in action:

Sure, not everyone is making millions, but these stories show what's possible when royalties work as promised. For many creators, it's less about hitting the jackpot and more about getting paid fairly, consistently, and automatically.

NFT royalties, at their best, turn creativity into a sustainable hustle.

Okay, so NFT royalties sound like a dream, right? Passive income, creative freedom, and no stuffy gatekeepers telling you what to do. But before you quit your job to become a full-time NFT artist, let's talk about the not-so-glamorous side.

Royalties only come in when an NFT is resold. So what happens if nobody's buying or selling your work anymore? Yup—no resale = no royalty.And the NFT market? It's about as stable as your friend's crypto portfolio during a bear market.

In short: NFT royalties depend on ongoing demand, and that can be a wild ride.

Here's the kicker: NFT royalties aren't hardcoded into the blockchain itself. They're usually enforced by platforms like OpenSea, Rarible, or Magic Eden—meaning…

It's kind of like leaving a tip at a restaurant: expected, but not always enforced. Unless platforms agree to work together (spoiler: they don't always), creators can get left out.

Some buyers purposely use NFT marketplaces that ignore royalties to save money—especially on expensive NFTs. This means:

Imagine working for months on an artwork only for it to be sold later without a single cent coming back to you. Ouch.

Let's be honest: not every NFT project is a forever success. Trends fade, collectors move on, and even the coolest JPEGs can lose their luster. That means:
            




For most, NFT royalties are not a set-it-and-forget-it retirement plan—they're a nice bonus while your work is hot.

So yes, NFT royalties can feel like magic, but the spell doesn't always last. Next up, we'll talk about what the future could look like—and whether there's still hope for creators looking to turn pixels into paychecks.





Alright, now we're heading into the land of laws, rights, and digital drama—because yes, even in the wild world of NFTs, the boring-but-important stuff like intellectual property and regulations still matter. Especially when we're talking about NFT royalties.

Just because someone buys your NFT doesn't mean they own the rights to your actual artwork. Confused? Here's the simple version:

This becomes super important if someone starts selling T-shirts with your art or making spin-offs. Without clear copyright terms in the NFT metadata or contract, things can get messy fast.

Even with smart contracts, NFT royalties can lead to disagreements:

These things happen more than you'd think. The decentralized nature of the space means enforcement is often left up to platforms or—worse—Twitter drama and community outrage.

Right now, the NFT space is kind of like the internet in the '90s: exciting, chaotic, and mostly unregulated. But that won't last forever.

Governments and regulators are starting to take notes:

For creators, this could be good news—especially if future laws help lock in royalties as a right, not just a nice-to-have.

So you're ready to ride the NFT wave like a pro surfer, and you've got your sights set on those sweet NFT royalties. Awesome! But before you start counting passive income in your sleep, let's go over a few smart strategies to help you actually get paid—and keep the good vibes going.

You can set your royalty percentage when minting an NFT—usually between 2.5% and 10% of every resale. But the golden rule?

Remember: the royalty is a thank-you, not a tollbooth.

Not all marketplaces play by the same rules. Some platforms proudly honor NFT royalties. Others? Not so much.

Here are a few with a rep for respecting creators:

Hot tip: Check the fine print (or community chatter) before committing to any platform. Some newer “zero-fee” platforms are also “zero-royalty,” which isn't great if you're counting on long-term income.

Look, NFT royalties are great when they come in—but they're not always a steady paycheck. To stay financially healthy in Web3 (or anywhere), it's smart to diversify.

Here's how:

Royalties are one piece of the puzzle—but your creativity? That's the real goldmine.

With these tips in your digital toolkit, you'll be better equipped to build a royalty strategy that's fair, future-proof, and financially sane. Next up: let's peek into what the future holds for NFT royalties. Will they stick around—or are they just a shiny phase in Web3 history?

Let's bring it home. NFT royalties have opened up an exciting new world where artists and creators can finally earn from their work long after the first sale. The idea of passive income sounds amazing—who wouldn't want to keep making money every time their art changes hands? But here's the reality check: while NFT royalties can provide ongoing earnings, they're not always enforced, the market can be unpredictable, and the legal side is still catching up.

That doesn't mean creators should ignore them—far from it. Royalties are still a powerful tool in the digital creator's kit. Just don't treat them as a guaranteed income stream. Think of them as one ingredient in a bigger recipe. If you're smart about platforms, fair with your royalty rates, and open to multiple income sources, NFT royalties can absolutely work in your favor—just maybe not forever on their own.

A sharp pullback characterized the broader cryptocurrency market on Thursday, leading to a bearish pattern break in Bitcoin (BTC) to briefly test the $100k levels. The market-wide panic with the Bitcoin sell-off led to quick profit bookings in altcoins such as Lido DAO (LDO), Jupiter (JUP), and Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET). 

At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $101,724 as it bounces off the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $100,860. The price action shows BTC breaking out of a Head-and-Shoulders pattern with a neckline near $102,250, as shared in the chart below. 

The momentum indicators' sell signal for traders aligns with the price movement as the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicator line and its signal line fall closer to the centre line while the red histogram bars rise in the negative territory. On a similar trend, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 42 breaks below the halfway line, with the recent plunge signaling a significant decline in bullish momentum. 

The immediate 50-day EMA support helps sustain BTC above $100K for the moment. Suppose the crypto price takes a reversal from the broken neckline to breach the 50-day EMA. It could target $96,732, aligning with the 100-day EMA. 

If the short-term BTC price reclaims the lost neckline at $102,250, investors could witness Bitcoin push to $106,749, the weekly high. 

LDO takes a breather after the 14% drop on Thursday, with no significant price movement at press time in early Asian hours. Lido DAO falls under the $0.80 level but avoids a closing below May's low at $0.741. 

Currently, the altcoin finds support from a declining trendline formed by the daily lows of May 18, 20, and 31. Completing a falling wedge with the support trendline, swing highs in LDO on January 31, May 13, and June 4 give rise to a converging resistance trendline.

The MACD indicator line and its signal line plunge in the negative direction, while the RSI at 39 signals room for a pullback before the altcoin reaches oversold conditions shortly. 

If the LDO closing price dives below the $0.741 support, it will mark a decisive breakdown of the falling wedge pattern. Sideline investors looking to sell can find entry opportunities in such a case, with the price target at $0.630, the lowest daily close since July 2022.

On the flip side, a bounce back could face resistance at the 50-day EMA at $0.894. 

Similar to Bitcoin, Jupiter price action reveals a Head-and-Shoulders pattern breakout triggered by an 11.70% drop on Thursday. At the time of writing, Jupiter is at $0.4585, remaining silent in the day after the crash. 

Shaping the bearish pattern, the 200-day EMA influences the head peak, while the 100-day EMA dynamic resistance creates the two shoulders, as shown in the chart below. Following the $0.4764 neckline break, the path of least resistance suggests a downward move to the $0.4019 support level, the lowest price reached in May. 

Increasing the downside risk, the momentum indicators reveal bearish dominance. The MACD indicator shows increasing red histogram bars while the RSI at 39 approaches the oversold boundary.

However, a reversal in JUP closing above the broken neckline at $0.4764 could propel it to the 50-day EMA at $0.5139. 

FET evaporates the early week gains with two consecutive bearish days and is down nearly 5% so far this week. The AI token breaks under the 50-day and 100-day EMA merger near $0.75 and approaches the $0.70 support level highlighted by the low on May 19.

Typically, price action backs the thesis to buy at support levels, but the momentum indicators trigger a sell signal for FET as it approaches the $0.70 support level. Similar to other altcoins, the MACD indicator is characterized by rising red histograms and a downward trajectory of average lines in the negative territory. 

The RSI at 43 slips below the halfway line, indicating a loss in bullish momentum with room on the downside before hitting the oversold boundary.

If FET leaps off the $0.70 level, the merged EMAs at $0.75 could be immediate resistance.

However, a slip below $0.70 could push FET down to the $0.50 psychological level.

Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), a Solana-based meme coin boasting a market capitalization of slightly over $1 billion, is extending its gains, trading at around $1.08 at the time of writing on Friday. 

The cryptocurrency market capitalization drops 4% to $3.3 trillion amid growing concerns about tariffs and global trade. Bitcoin rebounds after testing support slightly above $100,000, reflecting weak sentiment in the broader crypto market.

Meme coins market capitalization has dropped by over 5% to $56.34 billion in the last 24 hours, with top names such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) declining further in a falling wedge pattern.

Solana (SOL) edges higher by 2% at press time on Friday as it avoids a drop to the $140 support zone. However, the Solana price trend is approaching its second consecutive bearish week close, following a near 6% drop on Thursday.

Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled to a low of $101,095 on Friday amid volatility in the market. The effect of the tussle between United States (US) President Donald Trump and Tesla Chief Elon Musk negatively influenced the NASDAQ and Tesla's stock price on Thursday, although both are recovering on Friday.

At Secret Math Meeting, Researchers Struggle to Outsmart AI

The world's leading mathematicians were stunned by how adept artificial intelligence is at doing their jobs

By Lyndie Chiou edited by Clara Moskowitz

On a weekend in mid-May, a clandestine mathematical conclave convened. Thirty of the world's most renowned mathematicians traveled to Berkeley, Calif., with some coming from as far away as the U.K. The group's members faced off in a showdown with a “reasoning” chatbot that was tasked with solving problems they had devised to test its mathematical mettle. After throwing professor-level questions at the bot for two days, the researchers were stunned to discover it was capable of answering some of the world's hardest solvable problems. “I have colleagues who literally said these models are approaching mathematical genius,” says Ken Ono, a mathematician at the University of Virginia and a leader and judge at the meeting.

The chatbot in question is powered by o4-mini, a so-called reasoning large language model (LLM). It was trained by OpenAI to be capable of making highly intricate deductions. Google's equivalent, Gemini 2.5 Flash, has similar abilities. Like the LLMs that powered earlier versions of ChatGPT, o4-mini learns to predict the next word in a sequence. Compared with those earlier LLMs, however, o4-mini and its equivalents are lighter-weight, more nimble models that train on specialized datasets with stronger reinforcement from humans. The approach leads to a chatbot capable of diving much deeper into complex problems in math than traditional LLMs.

To track the progress of o4-mini, OpenAI previously tasked Epoch AI, a nonprofit that benchmarks LLMs, to come up with 300 math questions whose solutions had not yet been published. Even traditional LLMs can correctly answer many complicated math questions. Yet when Epoch AI asked several such models these questions, which were dissimilar to those they had been trained on, the most successful were able to solve less than 2 percent, showing these LLMs lacked the ability to reason. But o4-mini would prove to be very different.

Epoch AI hired Elliot Glazer, who had recently finished his math Ph.D., to join the new collaboration for the benchmark, dubbed FrontierMath, in September 2024. The project collected novel questions over varying tiers of difficulty, with the first three tiers covering undergraduate-, graduate- and research-level challenges. By February 2025, Glazer found that o4-mini could solve around 20 percent of the questions. He then moved on to a fourth tier: 100 questions that would be challenging even for an academic mathematician. Only a small group of people in the world would be capable of developing such questions, let alone answering them. The mathematicians who participated had to sign a nondisclosure agreement requiring them to communicate solely via the messaging app Signal. Other forms of contact, such as traditional e-mail, could potentially be scanned by an LLM and inadvertently train it, thereby contaminating the dataset.

The group made slow, steady progress in finding questions. But Glazer wanted to speed things up, so Epoch AI hosted the in-person meeting on Saturday, May 17, and Sunday, May 18. There, the participants would finalize the final batch of challenge questions. Ono split the 30 attendees into groups of six. For two days, the academics competed against themselves to devise problems that they could solve but would trip up the AI reasoning bot. Each problem the o4-mini couldn't solve would garner the mathematician who came up with it a $7,500 reward.

By the end of that Saturday night, Ono was frustrated with the bot, whose unexpected mathematical prowess was foiling the group's progress. “I came up with a problem which experts in my field would recognize as an open question in number theory—a good Ph.D.-level problem,” he says. He asked o4-mini to solve the question. Over the next 10 minutes, Ono watched in stunned silence as the bot unfurled a solution in real time, showing its reasoning process along the way. The bot spent the first two minutes finding and mastering the related literature in the field. Then it wrote on the screen that it wanted to try solving a simpler “toy” version of the question first in order to learn. A few minutes later, it wrote that it was finally prepared to solve the more difficult problem. Five minutes after that, o4-mini presented a correct but sassy solution. “It was starting to get really cheeky,” says Ono, who is also a freelance mathematical consultant for Epoch AI. “And at the end, it says, ‘No citation necessary because the mystery number was computed by me!'”

Defeated, Ono jumped onto Signal early that Sunday morning and alerted the rest of the participants. “I was not prepared to be contending with an LLM like this,” he says, “I've never seen that kind of reasoning before in models. That's what a scientist does. That's frightening.”

Although the group did eventually succeed in finding 10 questions that stymied the bot, the researchers were astonished by how far AI had progressed in the span of one year. Ono likened it to working with a “strong collaborator.” Yang Hui He, a mathematician at the London Institute for Mathematical Sciences and an early pioneer of using AI in math, says, “This is what a very, very good graduate student would be doing—in fact, more.”

The bot was also much faster than a professional mathematician, taking mere minutes to do what it would take such a human expert weeks or months to complete.

While sparring with o4-mini was thrilling, its progress was also alarming. Ono and He express concern that the o4-mini's results might be trusted too much. “There's proof by induction, proof by contradiction, and then proof by intimidation,” He says. “If you say something with enough authority, people just get scared. I think o4-mini has mastered proof by intimidation; it says everything with so much confidence.”

By the end of the meeting, the group started to consider what the future might look like for mathematicians. Discussions turned to the inevitable “tier five”—questions that even the best mathematicians couldn't solve. If AI reaches that level, the role of mathematicians would undergo a sharp change. For instance, mathematicians may shift to simply posing questions and interacting with reasoning-bots to help them discover new mathematical truths, much the same as a professor does with graduate students. As such, Ono predicts that nurturing creativity in higher education will be a key in keeping mathematics going for future generations.

“I've been telling my colleagues that it's a grave mistake to say that generalized artificial intelligence will never come, [that] it's just a computer,” Ono says. “I don't want to add to the hysteria, but in many ways these large language models are already outperforming most of our best graduate students in the world.”

A wave of mpox cases in West Africa has been concentrated in densely populated Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital city. Credit: Patrick Meinhardt/AFP via Getty


                You have full access to this article via your institution.

A surge of mpox infections in the small African nation of Sierra Leone has pummelled the country's health-care system, raising the possibility that the virus will spread to neighbouring countries and spark a larger outbreak throughout the densely populated region of West Africa.

Sierra Leone has confirmed 15 deaths and more than 3,000 mpox infections — more than half of all new infections for Africa — over the past month. According to an analysis of 76 viral genomes posted on the discussion forum Virological.org on 28 May, the outbreak began in November. The work also suggests that there have been at least four times more infections than officials have reported, says Edyth Parker, a genomic epidemiologist at the Institute of Genomics and Global Health in Ede, Nigeria, who is a co-author.

“The situation is so dire — the number of cases keeps increasing rapidly,” says Jia Kangbai, an infectious-diseases epidemiologist at Njala University in Freetown, Sierra Leone. “Things are getting very challenging now.”

The virus that causes mpox can lead to painful, fluid-filled lesions on the skin, and produce fever and, in severe cases, death. The virus, which is thought to persist in some wild rodent species, is endemic in several African countries, including Sierra Leone, and occasionally spills into people.

Health officials have been on high alert for surges of the virus that causes mpox ever since it spread to regions that it had never reached before, causing a global outbreak of the disease in 2022. That outbreak, which continues today at a slower pace, has infected more than 100,000 people, mainly men who have sex with men.

The virus that causes mpox (pink) is shown infecting a cell (green) in this colourized electron microscope image.

But the boom in infections in Sierra Leone has virologists worried once again: the country has reported a near-exponential growth in mpox cases that seem to be spreading from person to person, mainly among young people, both men and women. Epidemiological data suggest that sexual contact is a driver of the outbreak, because several sex workers have been infected and many people have reported genital lesions, according to a 27 May study posted on the preprint server medRxiv ahead of peer review1.

The surge in cases, which has been concentrated in Sierra Leone's capital city of Freetown, is fuelled by the same strain, clade IIb, that caused the global outbreak, according to the Virological.org analysis. This shows that when mpox is “put into a densely populated area where you have these dense sexual networks, it can take off very easily”, says Jason Kindrachuk, a virologist at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, who co-authored the medRxiv preprint.

The number of reported infections is likely to continue increasing sharply, because Sierra Leone's health-care system lacks the capacity to curb the outbreak, Kangbai says. He adds that the country is entering its rainy season, meaning that more people will congregate indoors, creating more opportunities for the virus to spread.

This outbreak comes as several African countries continue to battle their own mpox outbreaks, putting pressure on resources across the continent. A concerning strain of the virus, called clade Ib, has gained the ability to spread through sexual contact, causing a boom in infections across Central Africa, especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), since 2024.

Tree Planting Efforts Could Actually Worsen Climate Change

With wildfires turning forests into “massive carbon emitters,” planting trees in some places could inadvertently increase carbon emissions, a new report says

CLIMATEWIRE | Carbon markets that fund forest preservation and tree-planting might actually be worsening climate change by increasing risks for wildfires that emit massive levels of greenhouse gases, a new United Nations-affiliated report says.

Forests have been seen as one of the most effective places to counter climate change by absorbing carbon emissions. But that's changed, says a May paper from the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health (UNU-INWEH), an academic arm of the international U.N.

In the past decade, wildfires of record-breaking size have erupted in places such as Canada, Australia, Siberia and the Amazon rainforest. This week, forest wildfires forced evacuations of thousands of Canadians in Manitoba and Alberta provinces.

“Forests and peatlands have increasingly transitioned into massive carbon emitters in many parts of the world due to increasing wildfires,” the report says. Climate policies and carbon-mitigation activities ”fail to account for these substantial emissions.”

The report highlights weaknesses in a central global strategy for addressing climate change — planting and protecting trees — which has attracted billions of dollars from polluters that fund the projects to offset their own carbon emissions. A large share of the money is paid through the voluntary carbon market, a largely unregulated system that has come under increasing scrutiny over its integrity.

Recent major wildfires have been particularly harmful. The 2023 forest wildfires in Canada emitted more greenhouse gases than the total industrial emissions of any country in the world except for China and India, Ju Hyoung Lee, a research fellow at UNU and lead author of the report, said in an interview from Seoul, South Korea.

In California, wildfires in 2024 destroyed parts of forests that were supposed to be storing carbon through an offset program under the state's cap-and-trade carbon market.

Without systematic monitoring of forest conditions, the paper says, the voluntary carbon market and other policies that promote forests “may unintentionally exacerbate wildfire hazards.”

Planting new trees to absorb carbon could have the opposite effect, the report says, as more heat and increased carbon dioxide emissions from climate change accelerate forest growth while also depleting soil moisture.

“Planting more and more trees in such an environment with the purpose of carbon mitigation will likely increase carbon emissions due to future fires,” the report warns.

When the businesses certifying forest projects in the voluntary carbon market consider wildfire risk, they normally look at historical incidents of fires, Lee said. But, she added, “Forests are changing, and our forests [won't] be like what it was like for the last 20 years."

Historical data often leaves out the past five years, which includes some of the worst fires on record, Lee said.

As a result, fire risk is typically underestimated by nonprofits such as Verra, which sets standards for and certifies climate projects to be listed on the voluntary market, Lee said. Representatives for Verra did not respond to a request for comment.

Concerns about forests and their changing dynamics have existed for more than a decade, Kaveh Madani, director of the UNU-INWEH, said in an interview from Toronto.

The report hopes to get the message out, Madani said, that existing forest programs and certification standards were developed using science that's now outdated — and the projects ”can increase the risk of increased emissions, in some cases.”

Madani emphasized that not all forest programs in the voluntary carbon market and elsewhere create a wildfire threat.

The paper advocates reforming the voluntary carbon market and similar systems to better account for forest conditions and to prevent unintended consequences, including more wildfires.

Rainfall, soil health, and expected future droughts and heat waves should be considered before approving forest projects “as a carbon emissions reduction solution,” the paper says.

Satellite observations could identify areas where forests are growing and fuels are accumulating, leading them to be excluded from carbon markets “due to the potential high emissions in case of future fires,” the paper says.

The risk of wildfire and other environmental conditions that could damage forests “must be included in our planning for the future and the schemes that we have in place,” Madani said.

But it also makes the concept of time-traveling into alternate futures a reality.

Here's what you'll learn in this story:



What would the universe look like if you could travel faster than light? The answer may provide a surprising explanation to the mysteries of quantum mechanics.

Our universe plays by certain rules, which originate from different branches of physics. But sometimes the rules seem inconsistent with each other or don't quite line up. And in other cases the rules seem to come out of nowhere, without clear explanation. 

Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity is one set of rules that helps us understand the universe. This theory tells us that time and space are linked together in a four-dimensional fabric, called space-time, with three dimensions of space and one of time. Time is special because we can only move in the direction of our future, unlike the spatial dimensions, where we are free to move wherever we like. Plus, special relativity tells us that movement in space-time is limited to no faster than the speed of light, 380,000 feet per second.

Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, gives us rules about how subatomic systems work, those particles smaller than atoms. And those rules are very, very strange. For example, in quantum mechanics particles can seem to appear in multiple locations at once, and we are never exactly sure where a particle will end up. In fact, we've had to create an entire language called wave-particle duality to accommodate these rules. In this view, particles aren't really particles. Instead they are waves of probability that slosh around. Where the waves peak, we have a good chance of finding the particle the next time we go looking for it. And where the waves are at their minimum, we are unlikely to see that particle.

These rules of quantum mechanics also allow for seemingly contradictory behavior like quantum entanglement, where one particle can influence another instantaneously—blowing well past the speed of light limit from special relativity.

In an effort to tackle these issues, researchers from the Universities of Warsaw and Oxford asked an altogether different kind of question. What would the universe be like if you could travel faster than light? Now in special relativity it's impossible to move from below the speed of light and accelerate to reach it, let alone go faster than light. But the rules of special relativity also allow the reverse situation, where objects can start off faster than light already—but then they can never slow down below that limit. 

According to the researchers, for observers who are already traveling faster than light, the connection between time and space is flipped. Instead of three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension, faster than light observers see three dimensions of time and only a single dimension of space. This means that particles follow more than one trajectory at once. In effect, they travel into more than one future simultaneously.

From our normal slower-than-the-speed-of-light perspective, it looks like these faster-than-light objects are not behaving like particles at all. Instead, they act like waves. Think about it. If you throw a baseball it only follows one path. But if the baseball hits a nearby pond, the water waves travel in multiple directions at once.

The researchers argue that this shift in perspective offers a possible explanation for the mysteries of quantum mechanics. Things like quantum entanglement, random probabilities, wave-particle duality, and all the other usual consequences of quantum mechanics seem to be natural outgrowths of this faster-than-light perspective. Instead of springing into existence without explanation—which is the default mode in quantum mechanics—these rules now have a potential reason. 

Indeed, the researchers point out that the concept of a particle in this perspective completely breaks down. Instead you can only talk about fields, which are waves that exist throughout all of space and time. The researchers point out that many theories in physics, especially ideas concerning the fundamental physics occurring in the extremely early universe, already employ fields that have faster-than-light properties.

However, whether or not the individual particles known as tachyons can travel faster than light remains an open question. That's because the existence of such particles would really mess up basic concepts in the universe, like causality and the progression from past to future that we are familiar with. But quantum mechanics already stretches those concepts, so it's possible that the universe already runs on these non-intuitive rules. Perhaps we just need to make the connection.

Forecasting the short-term spread of an ongoing disease outbreak poses a challenge owing to the complexity of contributing factors, some of which can be characterized through interlinked, multi-modality variables, and the intersection of public policy and human behavior. Here we introduce PandemicLLM, a framework with multi-modal large language models (LLMs) that reformulates real-time forecasting of disease spread as a text-reasoning problem, with the ability to incorporate real-time, complex, non-numerical information. This approach, through an artificial intelligence–human cooperative prompt design and time-series representation learning, encodes multi-modal data for LLMs. The model is applied to the COVID-19 pandemic, and trained to utilize textual public health policies, genomic surveillance, spatial and epidemiological time-series data, and is tested across all 50 states of the United States for a duration of 19 months. PandemicLLM opens avenues for incorporating various pandemic-related data in heterogeneous formats and shows performance benefits over existing models.

Metrics details

Clinical decision-making in oncology is complex, requiring the integration of multimodal data and multidomain expertise. We developed and evaluated an autonomous clinical artificial intelligence (AI) agent leveraging GPT-4 with multimodal precision oncology tools to support personalized clinical decision-making. The system incorporates vision transformers for detecting microsatellite instability and KRAS and BRAF mutations from histopathology slides, MedSAM for radiological image segmentation and web-based search tools such as OncoKB, PubMed and Google. Evaluated on 20 realistic multimodal patient cases, the AI agent autonomously used appropriate tools with 87.5% accuracy, reached correct clinical conclusions in 91.0% of cases and accurately cited relevant oncology guidelines 75.5% of the time. Compared to GPT-4 alone, the integrated AI agent drastically improved decision-making accuracy from 30.3% to 87.2%. These findings demonstrate that integrating language models with precision oncology and search tools substantially enhances clinical accuracy, establishing a robust foundation for deploying AI-driven personalized oncology support systems.

The field of large language models (LLMs)1 has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years. Models such as GPT-4 (ref. 2) have demonstrated capabilities that closely mimic human reasoning and problem-solving abilities and have shown knowledge across various professional disciplines. In the medical field, for instance, GPT-4 has achieved a passing score on the United States Medical Licensing Examination and is able to provide detailed explanations for its responses3. In oncology, where clinical decision-making is increasingly complex, LLMs can serve as a rapid and reliable reference tool, for instance, by providing medical recommendation suggestions from official medical guidelines4. This capability could not only aid in daily decision-making processes but also educate oncologists to stay updated with the latest treatment recommendations.

However, similar to the medical domain itself, where doctors rely on information through speech, written text and imaging, the future of medical artificial intelligence (AI) is multimodal5. Recently, several such AI systems have been introduced6. Examples include models that analyze radiology images together with clinical data7 or integrate information from histopathology with genomic8 or text-based information9. These advancements have fueled anticipations for the advent of generalist multimodal AI systems10,11, characterized by their ability to concurrently analyze and reason across any dimension of medical information.

However, it remains to be investigated whether such generalist multipurpose AI models alone are suitable for medical applications. The distribution of human diseases is wide and complex, which is not captured in current performance benchmarks, where these models are predominantly evaluated on a single specific task at a time. In contrast, real-world clinical decision-making often requires multistep reasoning, planning and repeated interactions with data to uncover new insights to make informed and personalized decisions.

Despite advances with models such as Med-PaLM M11 or Med-Gemini12, the complexities to develop a generalist foundation LLM that truly performs on par with precision medicine tools remain a substantial challenge. Additionally, at present, regulatory policies in the United States and the European Union restrict the approval of a universal multipurpose AI model, given the philosophy that medical devices should fulfill a singular purpose13.

Previous work has shown that some of these limitations can partially be overcome by enriching LLMs with domain-specific information. This can be achieved through fine-tuning14 or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)15, a process that temporarily enhances an LLM's knowledge by incorporating relevant text excerpts from authoritative sources into the model, such as medical guidelines16 or textbooks. Yet, this strategy, concentrating on augmenting the knowledge base of the models, positions LLMs as mere information extraction tools only, rather than serving as true clinical assistants. Ideally, such a system would engage in reasoning, strategizing and performing actions on patient records and retrieve or synthesize new information to enable customized decision-making. Outside of the medical field, several such autonomous AI systems, also termed agents, have been proposed. Equipping an LLM with a suite of tools, such as calculators or web search, has proven superiority in tasks that require multistep reasoning and planning17,18. Similarly, in biomedical research, Arasteh et al. used the integrated data analysis tools of an LLM to analyze scientific data, achieving results on par with human researchers19. Such an approach would facilitate the opportunity of accessing the information repositories that currently exist in hospital systems, allowing for a true model for integrated patient care20.

In this study, we build and evaluate an AI agent tailored to interact with and draw conclusions from multimodal patient data through tools in oncology. Contrarily to the philosophy of an all-encompassing multimodal generalist foundation model, we see the achievements that specialist unimodal deep learning models have brought to precision medicine21 as a viable template even in the future by equipping an LLM, specifically GPT-4, with additional functions and resources. These could be precision oncology deep learning models or the ability to perform web search, all referred to herein as tools. Specifically, this study includes the vision model application programming interface (API) dedicated to generating radiology reports from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans, MedSAM22 for medical image segmentation and in-house developed vision transformer models trained to detect the presence of genetic alterations directly from routine histopathology slides23, in particular, to distinguish between tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI) and microsatellite stability (MSS)24 and to detect the presence or absence of mutations in KRAS and BRAF. Additionally, the system encompasses a basic calculator, capabilities for conducting web searches through Google and PubMed, as well as access to the precision oncology database OncoKB25. To ground the model's reasoning on medical evidence, we compile a repository of roughly 6,800 medical documents and clinical scores from a collection of six different official sources, specifically tailored to oncology.

To quantitatively test the performance of our proposed system, we devise a benchmark strategy on realistic, simulated patient case journeys. Existing biomedical benchmarks and evaluation datasets are designed for one or two data modalities26 and are restricted to closed question-and-answer formats. Recent advancements have been made with the introduction of new datasets by Zakka et al.16, targeting the enhancement of open-ended responses, and LongHealth27, focusing on patient-related content. Yet, these datasets are limited to text and do not capture multimodal data, such as the combination of CT or MRI images with microscopic and genetic data, alongside textual reports. Therefore, in the present study, we develop and assess our agent using a dataset comprising 20 realistic and multidimensional patient cases, which we generate with a focus on gastrointestinal oncology. For each patient case, the agent follows a two-stage process. Upon receiving the clinical vignette and corresponding questions, it autonomously selects and applies relevant tools to derive supplementary insights about the patient's condition, which is followed by the document retrieval step to base its responses on substantiated medical evidence, duly citing the relevant sources. To evaluate the results, we designed a blinded manual evaluation by four human experts, focusing on three areas: the agent's use of tools, the quality and completeness of the textual outputs and the precision in providing relevant citations. For effective tool application, the agent must first recognize the utility of a tool, comprehend the necessary inputs and then extract these inputs from the provided patient information. We provide an overview of our entire pipeline in Fig. 1. A detailed description of our methodology is provided in the Methods.

A schematic overview of our LLM agent pipeline. At its core, our system accesses a curated knowledge database comprising medical documents, clinical guidelines and scoring tools. This database is refined from a broader collection through keyword-based search, with the selected documents undergoing text embeddings for efficient storage and retrieval (1). The framework is further augmented with a suite of medical tools, including specialized web search capabilities through platforms such as Google, PubMed and access to the OncoKB API. The agent's capabilities are further expanded through the integration of a vision model tailored for generating detailed reports from CT and MRI scans, alongside MedSAM, a state-of-the-art medical image segmentation model and access to a simple calculator. Additionally, the system uses vision transformers specifically developed for the prediction of MSI versus MSS and the detection of KRAS and BRAF mutations in microscopic tumor samples (2). Given a simulated patient case, all tools are selected autonomously by the agent (3) with a maximum of ten per invocation and can be used either in parallel or in a sequential chain (4). This way, the agent can generate relevant patient information on demand and use this knowledge to query relevant documents within its database (4). This enables it to generate a highly specific and patient-focused response that integrates the initial clinical data with newly acquired insights, all while being substantiated by authoritative medical documentation (5).

Source data

To first demonstrate the superiority of combining medical tools and retrieval with an LLM, we compared our agent to GPT-4 alone. As an illustration, in Fig. 2a, we highlight three examples where tools and retrieval enabled the LLM to accurately solve cases, whereas, without these enhancements, GPT-4 either stated that it could not solve the patient case and provided hypothetical answers instead or drew incorrect conclusions, such as falsely assuming ‘disease progression' or ‘no evidence of disease' (in red). In contrast, the agent, by using tools, correctly identified treatment response and the presence of disease progression (in green). To quantify this, we assessed the model's ability to develop a comprehensive treatment plan for each patient, specifying appropriate therapies on the basis of recognizing disease progression, response or stability, mutational profile and all other relevant information, much like an oncologist would. Therefore, we compiled a set of 109 statements (completeness) for 20 different patient cases. We show that GPT-4 alone only provided 30.3% of the expected answers. However, our agent's responses achieved a 87.2% success rate, with only 14 instances not being covered (Fig. 2b). Overall, our results demonstrate that enhancing LLMs with tools drastically improves their ability to generate precise solutions for complex, realistic medical cases instead of providing only generic or even wrong responses when using LLMs in an out-of-the-box manner.

a, Top, to demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to a standard LLM, we highlight three cases where GPT-4 without tool use either fails to detect the current state of the disease for a given patient or provides very generic responses. Bottom, in contrast, tool access and retrieval enable the model to provide detailed information, such as measuring tumor surface and making appropriate decisions. b, The performance comparison shows a higher fraction of responses being evaluated as complete on our completeness benchmark for the agent with tool use and RAG versus GPT-4 alone.

Source data

We next investigated the overall capabilities and limitations of our agent across a panel of benchmarks in greater depth. To provide better guidance, we present one complete, simulated patient case and detail every step, from input over tool usage to the model's final output in Fig. 3. All tasks for the model and all answers are shown in Supplementary Note 1.

The full agent's pipeline for the simulated patient X, showcasing the complete input process and the collection of tools deployed by the agent. We abridge the patient description for readability (* …). The complete text is available in Supplementary Note 1. a,b, In the initial ‘tools' phase, the model identifies tumor localization from patient data and uses MedSAM for the generation of segmentation masks. Measuring the area of the segmented region enables the calculation of tumor progression over time as the model calculates an increase by a factor of 3.89. The agent also references the OncoKB database for mutation information from the patient's context (BRAFV600E and CD74–ROS1) and performs literature searches through PubMed and Google. For histological modeling, we must note here that we streamlined the processing. The original STAMP pipeline consists of two steps, where the first is the timely and computationally intensive calculation of feature vectors, which we performed beforehand for convenience. The second step is performed by the agent by selecting targets of interest and the location of the patient's data and executing the respective vision transformer (**). c, The subsequent phase involves data retrieval through RAG and the production of the final response.

Source data

First, we evaluated the agent's ability to recognize and successfully use tools (Fig. 4). Of 64 required tool invocations to fully solve all given patient cases, the agent correctly used 56, achieving an overall success rate of 87.5%, with no failures among the required tools. The remaining 12.5% of tools were required but missed by the model. There were two instances where the model tried to call superfluous tools without the necessary data available, which resulted in failures (Fig. 4, ‘tool use'). We provide an overview of each tool's invocation status in Supplementary Table 1. To provide an illustrative example, in the patient case from Fig. 3, GPT-4 used its tools to evaluate the patient's conditions by first identifying tumor localization from patient data and generating segmentation masks with MedSAM. It calculated tumor progression by measuring the segmented area's growth and referenced the OncoKB database for mutation information. The model then performed literature searches and histological modeling to select targets of interest, ultimately producing the final response through data retrieval with RAG.

Results from benchmarking the LLM agent through manual evaluation conducted by a panel of four medical experts. a–c, Steps in the agent's workflow as outlined in Fig. 3. For the metric ‘tool use', we report four ratios: represents the proportion of tools that were expected to be used to solve a patient case and that ran successfully (56/64), with no failures among the required tools. Required/unused (8/64) are tools that the LLM agent did not use despite being considered necessary. Additionally, there are two instances where a tool that was not required was used, resulting in failures. ‘Correctness' (223/245), ‘wrongness' (16/245) and ‘harmfulness' (6/245) represent the respective ratios of accurate, incorrect (yet not detrimental) and damaging (harmful) responses relative to the total number of responses. Here, a response is constituted by individual paragraphs per answer. ‘Completeness' (95/109) measures the proportion of experts' expected answers, as predetermined by keywords, that the model accurately identifies or proposes. ‘Helpfulness' quantifies the ratio of subquestions the model actually answers to all questions or instructions given by the user (63/67). Lastly, we measure whether a provided reference is correct (194/257), irrelevant (59/257, where the reference's content does not mirror the model's statement) or wrong (4/257). Results shown here are obtained from the majority vote across all observers, selecting the least favorable response in cases of a tie.

Source data

We additionally benchmarked GPT-4 against two state-of-the-art open-weights models, Llama-3 70B (Meta)28 and Mixtral 8x7B (Mistral)29, for which we show exemplary results in Fig. 5a and quantitative evaluations in Fig. 5b. We provide results for each patient in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3. Given substantial shortcomings in the latter two, we decided to only focus on GPT-4 as it demonstrated reliable and highly effective performance in identifying relevant tools and applying them correctly to patient cases.

a, Example tool results from three state-of-the-art LLMs (Llama-3, Mixtral and GPT-4). While the former two demonstrate failures in calling tools (or performing meaningless superfluous calculations in the case of Llama), GPT-4 successfully uses image segmentation on the MRI images and uses the calculator to calculate tumor changes in size. b, Tool benchmarking calling performance for these three models in a similar fashion to Fig. 4. Overall, our findings reveal that both open-weight models demonstrate only extremely poor function-calling performance. First, both models struggle to identify necessary tools for a given patient context (18.8% of required tools remain unused by Llama and even 42.2% for Mistral). Next, even in instances where the correct tool was identified, the model frequently failed to supply the necessary and accurate function arguments (‘required, failed'). This deficiency results in invalid requests that disrupt program functionality (Llama, 42.2%; Mixtral, 50.0%), ultimately leading to crashes. We saw none of these cases for GPT-4. Consequently, for Llama and Mixtral, the overall success rates were low, registering only 39.1% (Llama) and 7.8% (Mixtral) (‘required, successful'). Moreover, we saw that the Llama model frequently used superfluous tools, for example, performing random calculations on nonsense values or hallucinating (inventing) tumor locations during imaging analysis that did not exist. This led to 62 unnecessary tool calls and failures (‘not required, failed') across all 20 patient cases evaluated. The major shortcoming of the Mixtral model was its frequent disregard for tool use, resulting in fewer than one in ten tools running successfully.

Source data

Additionally, we observed that GPT-4 is capable of chaining sequential tool calls, using the output from one tool as input for the next. For example, in the tool results for patient G in Supplementary Note 2, GPT-4 invoked the MedSAM tool twice to obtain segmentation masks from two images taken at different time points. Subsequently, GPT-4 used the calculator function with the appropriate values from MedSAM to determine that the tumor had grown by a factor of 2.14. As another example, for patient W (Supplementary Note 2), the model used vision transformer models to assess the patient's mutational status, confirming the presence of a suspected BRAF mutation. The model then queried the OncoKB database to retrieve medical information on appropriate management regarding the mutation.

Additionally, we assessed the robustness of the agent across multiple repetitions and diverse patient populations, specifically considering different combinations in sex (Extended Data Fig. 1a), age (Extended Data Fig. 1b) and origin (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Our evaluation showed that the primary source of performance variation was the number of tools required for each patient case, rather than intrinsic patient factors (Extended Data Fig. 1d).

In summary, we can demonstrate that GPT-4 can effectively manage complex scenarios by sequentially using multiple tools, integrating their results and drawing informed conclusions on subsequent tool usage on the basis of prior information.

Second, we investigated the use of radiology processing tools by the agent. In our scenario, GPT-4 had two options: using the GPT-4 Vision (GPT-4V) API to generate comprehensive radiology reports (useful when no radiology report was provided for a patient) or using MedSAM for image segmentation to generate surface segmentation masks of the described tumor reference lesions when localizations of reference lesions were included in the patient case vignette. For both options, the model first had to identify the location where the images were stored on the filesystem, extract the order in which the images were taken (by date, indicated in the image file names) and send them to the appropriate tool. In our evaluations, we found that, despite occasional omissions, extraneous details, lack of information or making mistakes (highlighted in red in Supplementary Note 2), GPT-4V could nonetheless effectively guide the agent's decision.

Similarly, for MedSAM as a tool, the expected workflow for GPT-4 involved first locating the relevant patient images on the system, identifying their chronological order and receiving the locations of described reference lesions from the patient case vignette. After sending a request to MedSAM and receiving the results (tumor segmentation sizes), the model was usually expected to use the calculator to determine the percentage change according to RECIST criteria. This process is schematically illustrated in Fig. 3, with a detailed example provided in Supplementary Note 2 for patient G. We show that, in all instances, MedSAM received information on all relevant tumor locations and returned results that were helpful to GPT-4 to determine the appropriate next steps on the basis of calculating whether the patient showed progressive disease or remained in a stable condition.

In summary, we show that our pipeline is able to autonomously handle multiple steps, such as determining the need for specific tools, locating the relevant data, understanding their chronological order, sending requests to the appropriate tool, receiving results and integrating these into the next steps of its decision-making, for instance, using a calculator to compare tumor sizes over time. All of these steps are managed fully autonomously, without human supervision, by the LLM agent.

Thirdly, a central point in our analysis was the assessment of response accuracy (correctness). To evaluate this, we segmented the responses into smaller, evaluable items on the basis of the appearance of citations or transitions in topic within subsequent sentences, resulting in a total of 245 assessable statements. Our evaluations found 223 (91.0%) of these to be factually correct and 16 (6.5%) to be incorrect, while 6 (2.4%) were flagged as potentially harmful. Detailed instances of erroneous and harmful responses are provided in Supplementary Table 4 for review.

Remarkably, the agent was capable of resolving issues, even in instances where contradictory information was provided in a patient's description, such as discrepancies in reported mutations versus results of testing such mutations using tools. In such cases, the agent pointed out these inconsistencies, recommended further genetic confirmation and outlined potential treatment options based on the results (patients D and X). An illustrative example of the model's response is presented in Fig. 3.

Next, we assessed the degree of helpfulness of the agent by evaluating the proportion of subquestions it answered sophistically according to the human evaluators. Among the aggregate of 67 queries, 63 (94.0%) were categorized as having been effectively addressed.

Fourth, aiming to ensure transparency in the decision-making process, we instigated its adherence to citing relevant sources. Through manual review, we determined that, of the 257 citations provided in the models' responses, 194 (75.5%) were accurately aligned with the model's assertions, while 59 (23.0%) were found to be unrelated and merely 4 (1.6%) were found to be in conflict with the model's statement. These findings are promising, highlighting that instances of erroneous extrapolation (so-termed hallucinations) by the model are limited. Supplementary Notes 2 and 3 respectively display the unprocessed complete results from using the tools and the entire model outputs. Detailed evaluation results from each human observer are elaborated on in Supplementary Tables 4–6. Evaluation results for GPT-4 without tools and retrieval that we benchmarked for completeness can be found in Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Note 3.

Overall, our results show that GPT-4 with tools and RAG can deliver highly accurate, helpful and well-cited responses, which enhances its ability to handle complex medical scenarios and provide support for clinical decision-making.

Our results demonstrate that combining precision medicine tools with an LLM enhances its capabilities in problem solving, aligning with the concept of using LLMs as ‘reasoning engines' (ref. 30). As we have shown, GPT-4 alone only generates very generic or wrong responses. However, integrating three core elements (a reasoning engine, a knowledge database and tools) enables us to effectively address this limitation, greatly improving accuracy and reliability. Additionally, using tools has several further advantages. Despite the potential future development of a generalist medical multimodal foundation model10, its efficacy in addressing very specialized medical queries, such as predicting rare mutations or measuring disease development on the millimeter scale compared to narrower, domain-specific models, remains uncertain. Moreover, maintaining the alignment of such a generalist model with the evolving medical knowledge and updates in treatment guidelines is challenging, as it requires retraining model components on new data. Our tool-based approach, however, addresses all of these issues. It allows for the rapid update of medical knowledge by simply replacing documents in the database or searches through Google or PubMed, eliminating the need for direct modifications to the core model itself. Similarly, state-of-the-art medical devices that are approved by regulatory authorities can be included in our setup. Additionally, by using RAG, our system effectively addresses a major limitation in current LLMs, which often tend to hallucinate by providing wrong but seemingly correct or plausible answers to questions beyond their knowledge4. Mitigating this issue is particularly critical in sensitive domains such as healthcare. We show that our approach demonstrates a high capability in delivering accurate answers, supported by relevant citations from authoritative sources, which also facilitates quick fact-checking as the agent returns the exact original text from the guideline documents.

Our work has several limitations. The most notable is the small sample size for evaluation. Constructing these cases from real-world data requires careful manual crafting and evaluation while adhering to data protection standards, especially for cloud-based processing. We, therefore, consider our work as a proof-of-concept study for agentic AI workflows in oncology and encourage future efforts to develop larger-scale benchmark cases.

An important aspect beyond the scope of our study, which should be addressed in future research, is the selection of medical tools. While the core focus of our work lies in the tool-using abilities of language model agents, it is essential to recognize that individual tools require better independent optimization and validation. For example, we do not possess annotated ground-truth segmentation masks for comparison to MedSAM but use clinical endpoints such as progressive disease or tumor shrinkage as our primary metric to measure outcomes, which even more closely reflects the clinical workflow. As another example, vision transformers in our study were trained and tested on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and some radiology images available online may have been included in the pretraining of GPT-4V. In a production environment, however, such tools would simply be replaced with better-validated and extensively tested alternatives, such as the clinical-grade MSIntuit model31. Overall, we believe that, by prioritizing clinical endpoints to validate our agent pipeline, we can offer new, directly relevant evidence and metrics to address the current scarcity of objective measures for AI agents in healthcare.

Regarding the agent, although equipped with a broad array of tools compared to other frameworks17, it remains in an experimental stage, thus limiting clinical applicability. One notable restriction for instance lies in the provision of only a singular slice of radiology images and the yet limited capabilities of GPT-4V (ref. 32) in interpreting medical images. We anticipate great progress in generalist foundation models with greatly enhanced capabilities in interpreting three-dimensional (3D) images, including medical images. In this regard, we expect the development of more advanced, specialized medical image–text models, similar to the recently introduced Merlin model for 3D CT imaging33, which would allow adding these models as additional tools instead of simple ones such as MedSAM into our pipeline. Furthermore, an image–text model for radiology could also incorporate information on patient history and previous therapies to evaluate the current state of the disease like a radiologist would, instead of relying on lesion size changes only.

Moreover, our current agent architecture is a static design choice. Medical professionals, however, have access to an extensive array of complex tools and can alternate between tool usage and knowledge retrieval. For AI agents, integrating RAG and tool use concurrently could also be complementary, as RAG could assist in guiding the agent through complicated steps of tool application for specific diagnostic or treatment decisions. This synergy might help improve complex workflows with more and more challenging tools, which remains an area of further exploration.

Additionally, despite being implemented as a multiturn chat agent, our evaluation is currently confined to a single interaction. As a next step, we aim to incorporate multiturn conversations, including human feedback for refinement, akin to a ‘human-in-the-loop' concept34.

Furthermore, we restricted our patient scenarios to oncological use cases only, yet it is important to note that the underlying framework could be adapted to virtually any medical specialty, given the appropriate tools and data.

Next, regarding data protection in real-world settings, current regulatory restrictions make GPT-4 unsuitable because of its cloud-based nature, which necessitates transferring sensitive patient data to proprietary commercial servers. Consequently, we regard GPT-4 as a best-in-class model for proof-of-concept purposes and aim to explore open-weight models that can be deployed on local servers in the near future. Newer and better models, especially Llama-3 405B (ref. 35), might be promising candidates.

Moreover, medically fine-tuned models or models broadly optimized for tool use, such as Hermes-3-Llama-3.1 (ref. 36), also show considerable potential as local solutions.

Additionally, while our model receives relevant context from the RAG pipeline to provide accurate citations, there are several modifications and potential improvements to the retrieval process that we suggest exploring in future work. For instance, we used generalist embedding, retrieval and reranking models, whereas Xiong et al.37 demonstrated that domain-specific models can enhance retrieval performance. Moreover, for rare terms (such as rare diseases), exact match keyword searches can outperform similarity searches in embedding space and both can even be combined (also termed hybrid search38).

Moreover, modeling long context dependencies could be further improved by using models with larger context windows, such as Gemini 1.5 (ref. 39). This capability is especially crucial when scaling our approach to settings where patient information is not restricted to a single one-page case vignette but distributed across hundreds of documents.

Lastly, from a production setting perspective, another critical aspect is to consider how the LLM handles temporal dependencies in treatment recommendations. For instance, in lung cancer, molecular targeted treatments are subject to rapid changes and official guidelines are not always updated at the same pace as the latest trial results. In such a setting, our multitool agent could cross-reference information from official medical guidelines with more up-to-date information received through internet and PubMed searches. Previous work already showed that LLMs can reliably identify temporal differences in medical documents4.

Looking ahead, we anticipate more progress in the development of AI agents with even improved capabilities through further scaling. As a parallel step in this direction, Zhou et al.40 developed MedVersa, an AI system for medical image interpretation that leverages an LLM as a central ‘orchestrator'. This model is fully trainable to determine whether tasks can be completed independently or should be delegated to a specialist vision model and has demonstrated superior performance across multiple medical imaging benchmarks, often surpassing state-of-the-art models. The training of such a system holds immense potential, as it might allow models to learn critical concepts such as uncertainty, enabling them to recognize their limitations and delegate tasks to specialist models whenever appropriate. Although our model currently shows a strong ability to use given tools, task-specific fine-tuning and few-shot prompting41 (providing examples to the model) could further improve performance, particularly when increasing complexity with the addition of more and more complex tools. Additionally, we could enhance the system by incorporating human feedback on edge cases where the initial model performed poorly, similar to a human-in-the-loop approach. In the medical context, this method was already shown to improve prediction accuracy, as demonstrated in the context of molecular tumor board recommendations42.

To summarize, in the near future, we envision a framework that embodies characteristics akin to the GMAI model with the added ability to access precision medicine tools tailored to answer any kind of specialized clinical questions. This approach has multiple benefits. It enables medical AI models to assist clinicians in solving real-world patient scenarios using precision medicine tools, each tailored to specific tasks. Such a strategy facilitates circumventing data availability constraints inherent in the medical domain, where data are not uniformly accessible across all disciplines, preventing a singular entity from developing an all-encompassing foundational model. Instead, entities can leverage smaller, specialized models developed by those with direct access to the respective data, which could greatly improve discovering therapeutic options for personalized treatments. Moreover, this modular approach allows for individual validation, updating and regulatory compliance of each tool. In cases where existing tools are unsatisfactory or completely absent, the agent could rely on its internal strong medical domain knowledge and either refine43 or innovate entirely new tools from scratch. Crucially, this modular approach also offers far superior explainability compared to a large, generalist black-box model, as physicians can investigate the output from each individual tool separately. Herein, our study could serve as a blueprint, providing evidence that agent-based generalist medical AI is within reach.

To fully leverage the potential of AI agents in the near future, it will be crucial to integrate them as deeply into routine clinical practice as possible, ideally through direct incorporation into existing clinical information systems for live access to patient data with only minimal workflow disruption for clinicians. However, this first necessitates addressing many deployment challenges, including concerns regarding interoperability with existing systems, data privacy laws such as GDPR and HIPAA (in case of cloud-based models), liability and accountability issues and the need for regulatory approvals as medical devices44, which will also require much broader validation studies to show safety and benefits in actual clinical workflows. Lastly, there will be a critical need to educate medical professionals to effectively collaborate with AI agents while maintaining full authority over the final clinical decision-making.

This study did not include confidential patient information. All research procedures were conducted exclusively on publicly accessible, anonymized patient data and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, maintaining all relevant ethical standards. The overall analysis was approved by the Ethics Commission of the Medical Faculty of the Technical University Dresden (BO-EK-444102022).

The pipeline's primary goal is to compile a comprehensive dataset from high-quality medical sources, ensuring three main components: correctness, up-to-dateness and contextual relevance, with a particular emphasis on including knowledge across all medical domains while additionally encompassing information specifically tailored to oncology. We restricted our data access to six sources: MDCalc (https://www.mdcalc.com/) for clinical scores, UpToDate and MEDITRON14 for general-purpose medical recommendations and the Clinical Practice Guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology45, the European Society of Medical Oncology and the German and English subset of the Onkopedia guidelines from the German Society for Hematology and Medical Oncology. We retrieved and downloaded the relevant documents as either HTML extracted text or raw PDF files. To reduce the number of documents for the embedding step, we applied a keyword-based filtering of the document contents, targeting terms relevant to our specific use case. Medical guidelines that were obtained from the MEDITRON project were directly accessible as preprocessed jsonlines files.

The critical challenge in text extraction from PDF documents arises from the inherent nature of PDF files, which are organized primarily for the user's ease of reading and display while not adhering to a consistent hierarchical structure, thus complicating the extraction process. For instance, upon text mining with conventional tools such as PyPDF2 or PyMuPDF, headers, subheaders and key information from the main text may be irregularly placed, with titles occasionally embedded within paragraphs and critical data abruptly interspersed within unrelated text. However, maintaining the integrity of the original document's structure is crucial in the medical field to ensure that extracted information remains contextually coherent, preventing any conflation or misinterpretation. To overcome these limitations, we used GROBID (generation of bibliographic data), a Java application and machine learning library specifically developed for the conversion of unstructured PDF data into a standardized TEI46 format. Through its particular training on scientific and technical articles, GROBID enables the effective parsing of medical documents, preserving text hierarchy and generating essential metadata such as document and journal titles, authorship, pagination, publication dates and download URLs.

We next programmatically retrieved the raw document text from the generated XML fields in the TEI files, concurrently implementing data cleansing. This process encompasses the removal of extraneous and irrelevant information such as hyperlinks, graphical elements and tabular data that was corrupted during the extraction with GROBID, as well as any malformed characters or data such as inadvertently extracted IP addresses. The diversity of source materials presented a further challenge because of their varied formatting schemes. To address this, we meticulously reformatted and standardized the text from all sources, denoting headers with a preceding hash symbol (#) and inserting blank lines for the separation of paragraphs. The purified text, along with its corresponding metadata, was archived in jsonlines format for subsequent processing.

Below, we delineate the detailed architecture of our agent in a two-step process, beginning with the creation of our RAG15 database, followed by an overview of the agent's tool use and concluding with an examination of the final retrieval and response generation modules. Additionally, we highlight the structure of our model in detail in Supplementary Note 4.

We leveraged RAG to synergize the generative capabilities of LLMs with document retrieval to provide domain-specific medical knowledge (context) to a model. The RAG framework has greatly evolved in complexity recently; thus, we break down its architecture into three major components (embeddings, indexing and retrieval) and outline the implementation details of the first two in the next section. In RAG, we begin with the conversion of raw text data into numerical (vector) representations, also termed embeddings, which are consequently stored in a vector database alongside metadata and the corresponding original text (indexing). In more detail, we compute vector embeddings using OpenAI's ‘text-embedding-3-large' model from text segments of varying lengths (512, 256 and 128 tokens), each featuring a 50-token overlap, from the curated guideline cleaned main texts in our dataset, alongside their associated metadata for potential filtering operations. For storage, we use an instance of a local vector database (Chroma) that also facilitates highly efficient lookup operations using vector-based similarity measures such as cosine similarity (dense retrieval). We store documents from different sources in the same collection.

To endow the LLM with agentic capabilities, we equipped it with an array of tools, including the ability to conduct web searches through the Google custom search API and formulate custom PubMed queries. Information retrieved through Google search underwent text extraction and purification and was integrated directly as context within the model, while responses from PubMed were processed akin to the above-described RAG procedure in a separate database.

For the interpretation of visual data, such as CT or MRI scans, the LLM agent has access to two different tools. It can either call the GPT-4 Vision (GPT-4V) model, which is instructed to generate a comprehensive, detailed and structured report, or use MedSAM, which we explain in detail below. For both tasks, we primarily use representative slices from in-house CT and MRI chest and abdomen series, although a few cases are from public datasets, as highlighted in Supplementary Note 1. Our in-house slices were selected by an experienced radiologist from our team, who was blinded to the rest of the study at the time of image selection. In scenarios involving multiple images to model disease development over time, the model first investigates and reports on each image separately before synthesizing a comparative analysis. Because of the stringent adherence of OpenAI to ethical guidelines, particularly concerning the management of medical image data, we framed our patient cases as hypothetical scenarios when presenting them to the model. However, instances of refusal still arose, prompting us to discard the respective run entirely and initiate a new one from the beginning. Additionally, tasks that require the ability of the model to precisely measure the size of lesions and compare them over time can be solved using MedSAM22. MedSAM produces a segmentation mask for a given region of interest on the basis of an image and pixel-wise bounding box coordinates, enabling the calculation of the overall surface area. Herein, MedSAM processes each image independently; however, GPT-4 can track the results from MedSAM back to the original image date, as it has access to image file names that are based on date. This capability ensures accurate decision-making of lesion development over time. An example of this is demonstrated in Supplementary Note 2 under tool results for patient G. A potential limitation of the vision tool approach is that, for both scenarios, we currently restrict the use to single-slice images that additionally need to be taken at the same magnification.

Moreover, we provide access to a simplified calculation tool that allows elementary arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division by executing code locally using the Python interpreter.

To facilitate addressing queries related to precision oncology, the LLM leverages the OncoKB25 database to access critical information on medical evidence for treating a vast panel of genetic anomalies, including mutations, copy-number alterations and structural rearrangements. More specifically, GPT-4 can send the HUGO symbol, the change of interest (mutation, amplification or variant) and a specific alteration of interest (such as BRAFV600E) if applicable to the OncoKB API that returns a structured JSON object containing potential Food and Drug Administration-approved or investigational drug options including evidence levels. This enables querying any type of genetic arrangement, given it is listed on OncoKB and an appropriate license is acknowledged by the user.

Lastly, GPT-4 is also equipped to engage specialized vision transformer models for the histopathological analysis of phenotypic alterations underlying MSI24 or KRAS and BRAF mutations. For the KRAS and BRAF mutation prediction models, we used a setup similar to Wagner et al.23. These models were obtained by training a vision classifier model using histopathology features extracted from images of colorectal cancer tissue from TCGA. For feature extraction, we used CTranspath47, a state-of-the-art transformer model trained through self-supervised learning. To optimize time and computational resources, features were pre-extracted with CTranspath, which is a common procedure in computational pathology pipelines48. Consequently, instead of the original images, GPT-4 transmits these pre-extracted features to the MSI, KRAS, and BRAF vision transformers; however, it is important to note that this implementation detail is hidden from GPT-4 and, thus, has no influence on our overall pipeline. It, however, allows us to reduce the time and hardware requirements for each run in a research setting. For deployment purposes, one could easily, without making changes to the LLM agent itself, hide additional logic to extract features on the fly from the original images.

During each invocation, GPT-4 has to determine the availability of histopathology images for a patient, locate them within the system and select the targets (one, two or all three) for testing. It then receives a binary prediction (MSI versus MSS, KRAS mutant versus wild type or BRAF mutant versus wild type) along with the mutation probability in percentage.

All necessary information for calling the designated tools is derivable or producible from the given patient context. Unlike the retrieval phase, which we manually enforced at each invocation, the decision regarding the use and timing of tools is dependent only on the agent's reasoning. However, manual intervention to prompt tool usage is possible, as demonstrated in patients D and X. The specifications for all tools are delineated in JSON format, which is provided to the model and encompasses a brief textual description of each tool's function along with the required input parameters. From a procedural point of view, given an input comprising a variable-length textual patient context and a text query, the agent generates an initial action plan, followed by a series of iterative tool applications. The deployment of these tools can be executed either independently in parallel or sequentially, wherein the output from one tool serves as the input for another in subsequent rounds; for instance, the size of the segmentation areas obtained from two images through MedSAM can be used to compute a ratio and, thus, define disease progression, stability or response, as shown schematically in Fig. 1 and the patient case from Fig. 3.

The final retrieval and response generation pipeline is implemented using DSPy49, a library that allows for a modular composition of LLM calls. All instructions to the model can be found in our official GitHub repository. Firstly, the model receives the original patient context, the posed question and the outcomes from the tool applications as input. In a method similar to that described by Xiong et al.50, we used chain-of-thought reasoning51 to let the model decompose the initial user query into up to 12 more granular subqueries derived from both the initial patient context and the outcomes from tool applications. This facilitates the retrieval of documents from the vector database that more closely align with each aspect of a multifaceted user query. Precisely, for each generated subquery we extract the top k most analogous document passages from the collection. Subsequently, these data are combined, deduplicated, reranked and finally forwarded to the LLM. We highlight this process in more detail as pseudocode in Supplementary Note 4. Each request sent by the LLM to the RAG pipeline is transformed into a numerical representation using the same embedding model applied to the medical guidelines. We next use cosine distance (lower is better) to compare the query with any embedded chunk from the medical guidelines in the vector database, sorting in ascending order to retrieve the top 40 vectors, each mapped to their respective original text passage. Then, we use Cohere's reranking model (Cohere Rerank 3 English) to reorder the retrieved text passages on the basis of their semantic similarity to the LLM's query. This step filters out passages that exhibit falsely high similarity (low distance) in embedding space but are contextually irrelevant. For example, a query such as ‘Which drug is approved for NSCLC?' and text from a guideline saying ‘Drug A is not approved for non-small cell lung cancer' may show high cosine similarity (low distance), yet the former is irrelevant to the query. The reranking step helps to rank such passages lower. From the reranked results, we keep only the top ten relevant passages and repeat this entire process for each subquery (subtopic) generated by the model on the basis of the provided patient information. To reduce token usage, we remove duplicates from the entire collection of guideline text chunks, prefixed each with an enumeration of ‘Source [x]: …' to allow for accurate citations and then sent the data back to the LLM.

Before generating the final answer, we instruct the LLM to generate a step-by-step strategy to build a structured response including identifying missing information that could help refine and personalize the recommendations. The resulting model output is then synthesized on the basis of all available information, strictly following the strategy as a hierarchical blueprint. To enhance the system's reliability and enable thorough fact-checking, both of which are fundamental in real-world medical applications, the model was programmatically configured to incorporate citations for each statement (as defined as a maximum of two consecutive sentences) using DSPy suggestions49. On the implementation level, the LLM performs a self-evaluation step, wherein it compares its own output to the respective context from our database in a window of one to two sentences. We perform a single iteration over this procedure. All prompts are implemented using DSPy's signatures.

We additionally performed comparisons of GPT-4 with two state-of-the-art open-weight LLMs, namely Llama-3 70B from Meta AI28 and Mixtral 8x7B from Mistral29. On the basis of initial evidence from testing, we slightly simplified and shortened the original prompt from GPT-4 but left all other parameters with respect to the original tool composition unaltered. We evaluated the performance of function calling against GPT-4 on the 20 patient cases, reporting the following metrics: the fraction of required tool calls that were completed successfully (required/successful) and those that were required but failed (required/failed). Additionally, we assessed the fraction of necessary tool calls that the model failed to invoke (required/unused). Lastly, we measured the ratio of superfluous tool calls that the models invoked and that failed (not required/failed).

In our study, we consistently used the following models through the official OpenAI Python API for all experiments. The core framework for the agent and all tools involving an LLM is the gpt-4-0125-preview model (GPT-4). For tasks requiring visual processing, the gpt-4-vision-preview (GPT-4V) model was used through the chat completions endpoint. The temperature value for both models was empirically set to 0.2 for the agent phase and 0.1 during RAG upon initial experimentation and no further modifications of model hyperparameters were performed. Additionally, for generating text embeddings, we used the latest version of OpenAI's embedding models, specifically the text-embedding-3-large model, which produces embeddings with a dimensionality of 3,072. To establish a baseline for comparison without tools and retrieval, we also evaluated GPT-4 with identical hyperparameters using a chain-of-thought reasoning module. Additionally, for model benchmarking, we used the Meta Llama-3 70B model (llama3-70b-8192) and Mistral's Mixtral 8x7B model (mixtral-8x7b-32768) through the Groq API, setting temperature values to 0.2 and the maximum number of output tokens to 4096.

To address the limitations in current biomedical benchmarks, we compiled a collection of 20 distinct multimodal patient cases, primarily focusing on gastrointestinal oncology, including colorectal, pancreatic, cholangiocellular and hepatocellular cancers. Each case provided a comprehensive but entirely fictional patient profile, which includes a concise medical history overview encompassing diagnoses, notable medical events and previous treatments. We paired each patient with either a single or two slices of CT or MRI imaging that served as either sequential follow-up staging scans of the liver or lungs or simultaneous staging scans of both the liver and the lungs at a single point in time. Images were obtained predominantly from internal sources from the Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University Hospital Aachen, but we included a few samples from the web and the Cancer Imaging Archive52,53. We highlight these cases in Supplementary Note 1. Histology images were obtained from TCGA. We additionally included information into genomic variations (mutations and gene fusions) in several patient descriptions. To evaluate our model's proficiency in handling complex information, we decided to not pose a single straightforward question but instead structured each query with multiple subtasks, subquestions and instructions, necessitating the model to handle an average of three to four subtasks in each round. To evaluate the robustness of the model in using tools across various patient factors (Extended Data Fig. 1), we generated 15 random combinations of age, sex and origin for each of the 20 base cases, resulting in a total of 300 combinations.

To enhance the assessment of free-text output, we developed a structured evaluation framework, drawing inspiration from the methodology of Singhal et al.54. Our evaluation focused on three primary aspects: the use of tools by the agent, the quality of the text output produced by the model and the adherence in providing accurate citations.

In reference to the former, we established a manual baseline for the expected use of tools necessary for generating additional patient information that is crucial for resolving the patient's task. We measured this by the ratio of actual versus expected (required) tool uses. The requirement of tool use was defined as either the model is directly instructed to use a certain tool or the output of a tool is essential to proceed in answering the question, which is the default setting in almost all situations. Additionally, we assessed the helpfulness of the model, quantified by the proportion of user instructions and subquestions directly addressed and resolved by the model.

In assessing the textual outputs, our evaluation first encompassed factual correctness, defined by the proportion of correct replies relative to all model outputs. To segment answers into more manageable units, we split each reply according to statement (where a statement is considered a segment that concludes with either a reference to literature or is followed by a shift in topic in the subsequent sentence). Correspondingly, we distinguished between incorrectness and harmfulness in responses. Incorrect responses may include suggestions for superfluous diagnostic procedures or contain requests for irrelevant patient information. Conversely, harmful responses, while also incorrect, were determined by clinical judgment as potentially deleterious, such as advising suboptimal or contraindicated treatments. Furthermore, we assessed the completeness of the responses. For this purpose, we identified multiple specific keywords and terms for each unique medical scenario. These keywords represent expected interventions, such as treatments or diagnostic procedures and were carefully selected for their case relevance and crafted to be as specific as possible (for example, precise treatment combinations such as ‘FOLFOX and bevacizumab' instead of ‘chemotherapy and antiangiogenic drugs'). This criterion, which we term ‘completeness', was supposed to measure the extent to which the agent's response aligns with the essential information that oncologists would anticipate in a human-generated answer under similar conditions.

Lastly, we evaluated the alignment of the responses with the original document segments used by the model through RAG. For each reference in the model's output, we investigated the corresponding reference by its source identifier. Our evaluation encompassed three critical dimensions: citation correctness, ensuring the model's statements faithfully mirror the content of the original document, irrelevance, identifying instances where the model's assertions are not substantiated by the source material, and incorrect citation, detecting discrepancies where the information attributed to a source diverges from its actual content.

All evaluations described here were performed independently by four certified clinicians with expertise in oncology. For all benchmarks, we reported the majority vote. In cases of a tie, we selected the most adverse outcome, adhering to a hierarchical schema: correct, irrelevant and wrong for citations and correct, wrong and harmful for the correctness evaluation.

Data were analyzed using the pandas library and visualized with matplotlib in Python.

Data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested. Sample sizes were set at n = 20. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes. Experiments were not randomized, as only one test group (the AI agent) existed in this proof-of-concept study. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment; however, they were blinded to the model responses while establishing the ground truth for the necessity of tool use and the completeness of the responses. Experiments were limited to n = 1 per case because of stringent rate and access limitations at the time of experimentation, when access to GPT-4V was available only as a preview. No data were excluded in the analysis. Reproducibility of the study's findings may be affected by silent changes implemented to the model by its developers, which may not always be publicly disclosed, as well as by potential future model deprecations. Despite these factors, the results are expected to remain reproducible when using other current state-of-the-art models. Additionally, built-in guardrails designed to prevent potentially harmful content occasionally led to refusals and to inadequately addressing medical queries. In these instances, we reran each sample in newly instantiated settings until no such refusals occurred.

We show more details on the simulated patient cases from our benchmarking experiments including the sex (A) and age (B) distribution for all 20 cases. The pie chart in C shows the proportions of patient origins by country and ethnicity. For 55% of the patients, we did not provide this information in the patient case vignette (n/a), while the remaining 45% included diverse information on patient origin. (D) To investigate whether gender, age, and origin influence the models' tool-calling behavior, we conducted an additional experiment with 15 random permutations on all 20 patient cases (300 in total). Notably, we observed that in contrary to patient cases requiring relatively fewer tools (for example, patients Adams, Lopez and Williams), there was higher variability in tool-calling behavior in situations requiring more tools (for example, patient Ms Xing), regardless of the combinations of age, sex, and ethnicity/origin. Heatmaps are annotated on the x-axis as ‘age-sex-ethnicity/country of origin'.

Metrics details

From visual perception to language, sensory stimuli change their meaning depending on previous experience. Recurrent neural dynamics can interpret stimuli based on externally cued context, but it is unknown whether they can compute and employ internal hypotheses to resolve ambiguities. Here we show that mouse retrosplenial cortex (RSC) can form several hypotheses over time and perform spatial reasoning through recurrent dynamics. In our task, mice navigated using ambiguous landmarks that are identified through their mutual spatial relationship, requiring sequential refinement of hypotheses. Neurons in RSC and in artificial neural networks encoded mixtures of hypotheses, location and sensory information, and were constrained by robust low-dimensional dynamics. RSC encoded hypotheses as locations in activity space with divergent trajectories for identical sensory inputs, enabling their correct interpretation. Our results indicate that interactions between internal hypotheses and external sensory data in recurrent circuits can provide a substrate for complex sequential cognitive reasoning.

External context can change the processing of stimuli through recurrent neural dynamics1. In this process, the evolution of neural population activity depends on its own history as well as external inputs2, giving context-specific meaning to otherwise ambiguous stimuli3. To study how hypotheses can be held in memory and serve as internal signals to compute new information, we developed a task that requires sequential integration of spatially separated ambiguous landmarks4. In this task, the information needed to disambiguate the stimuli is not provided externally but must be computed, maintained over time and applied to the stimuli by the brain.

We trained freely moving mice to distinguish between two perceptually identical landmarks, formed by identical dots on a computer-display arena floor, by sequentially visiting them and reasoning about their relative locations. The landmarks were separated by <180 degrees in an otherwise featureless circular arena (50-cm diameter), to create a clockwise (CW) (‘a') and a counterclockwise (CCW) (‘b') landmark. Across trials, the relative angle between landmarks was fixed and the same relative port was always the rewarded one; within trials, the locations of landmarks was fixed. The mouse's task was to find and nose-poke at the CCW ‘b' landmark for water reward (‘b' was near one of 16 identical reward ports spaced uniformly around the arena; other ports caused a time out). At most, one landmark was visible at a time (enforced by tracking mouse position and modulating landmark visibility based on relative distance (Extended Data Fig. 1; Methods). Each trial began with the mouse in the center of the arena in the dark (‘LM0' phase; Fig. 1b), without knowledge of its initial pose. In the interval after first encountering a landmark (‘LM1' phase), an ideal agent's location uncertainty is reduced to two possibilities, but there is no way to disambiguate whether it saw ‘a' or ‘b.' After seeing the second landmark, an ideal agent could infer landmark identity (‘a' or ‘b'; this is the ‘LM2' phase; Fig. 1b) by estimating the distance and direction traveled since the first landmark and comparing those with the learned relative layout of the two landmarks; thus, an ideal agent can use sequential spatial reasoning to localize itself unambiguously. For most analyses, we ignored cases where mice might have gained information from not encountering a landmark, for example, as the artificial neural network (ANN) does in Fig. 2e (and Extended Data Fig. 2e). To randomize the absolute angle of the arena at the start of each new trial (and thus avoid use of any olfactory or other allocentric cues), mice had to complete a separate instructed visually guided dot-hunting task, after which the landmarks and rewarded port were rotated randomly together (Extended Data Fig. 1b).

a, Two perceptually identical landmarks are visible only from close up, and their identity is defined only by their relative location. One of 16 ports, at landmark ‘b,' delivers reward in response to a nose-poke. The animal must infer which of the two landmarks is ‘b' to receive reward; wrong pokes result in timeout. Tetrode array recordings in RSC yield 50–90 simultaneous neurons. b, Top, schematic example trial; bottom, best possible guesses of the mouse position. LM0, LM1 and LM2 denote task phases when the mouse has seen zero, one or two landmarks and could infer their position with decreasing uncertainty. c, Left, example training curve showing Phit/Pfalse-positive; random chance level is 1/16 for 16 ports. Mice learned the task at values >1, showing they could disambiguate between the two sequentially visible landmarks. This requires the formation, maintenance and use of spatial hypotheses.

a, Schematic examples of hypothesis-dependent landmark interpretation. Left, mouse encounters first LM, then identifies the second as ‘a' based on the short relative distance. Right, a different path during LM1 leads the mouse to a different hypothesis state, and to identify the perceptually identical second landmark as ‘b.' Hypothesis states preceding LM2 are denoted LM1a and LM1b, depending on the identity of the second landmark. b, Structure of an ANN trained on the task. Inputs encode velocity and landmarks. Right, mean absolute localization error averaged across test trials for random trajectories. c, Activity of output neurons ordered by preferred location shows transition between LM0, LM1 and LM2 phases. Red, true location. During LM1 (when the agent has only seen one landmark), two hypotheses are maintained, with convergence to a stable unimodal location estimate in LM2 after encountering the second landmark. d, 3D projection from PCA of ANN hidden neuron activities. During LM2, angular position in neural state space reflects position estimate encoding. e, Example ANN trajectories for two trials show how identical visual input (black arrowheads) leads the activity to travel to different locations on the LM2 attractor because of different preceding LM1a/b states.

Mice learned the task (P < 0.0001 on all mice, Binomial test versus random guessing; Fig. 1c), showing that they learn to form hypotheses about their position during the LM1 phase, retain and update these hypotheses with self-motion information until they encounter the second (perceptually identical) landmark, and use them to disambiguate location and determine the rewarded port. We hypothesized that RSC, which integrates self-motion5, position6,7,8, reward value9 and sensory10 inputs, could perform this computation. RSC is causally required to process landmark information11, and we verified that RSC is required for integrating spatial hypotheses with visual information but not for direct visual search with no memory component (Extended Data Fig. 1i–l).

We recorded 50–90 simultaneous neurons in layer 5 of RSC in four mice during navigational task performance using tetrode array drives12 and behavioral tracking (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Figs. 1 and 3; Methods). RSC neurons encoded information about both the mouse's location (Fig. 1d) and about the task phase, corresponding to possible location hypotheses (Fig. 1d,e). This hypothesis encoding was not restricted to a separate population: most cells encoded both hypothesis state as well as the animal's location (Fig. 1g).

This encoding was distinct from the encoding of landmark encounters in the interleaved dot-hunting task and was correlated per session with behavioral performance (Extended Data Fig. 4). The encoding of mouse location changed significantly across task phases (Fig. 1d,f), similar to the conjunctive coding for other spatial and task variables in RSC6. This mixed co-encoding of hypothesis, location and other variables suggests that RSC can transform new ambiguous sensory information into unambiguous spatial information through the maintenance and task-specific use of internally generated spatial hypotheses.

To test whether recurrent neural networks can solve sequential spatial reasoning tasks that require hypothesis formation, and to provide insight into how this might be achieved in the brain, we trained a recurrent ANN on a simplified one-dimensional (1D) version of the task, since the relevant position variable for the landmarks was their angular position (inputs were random noisy velocity trajectories and landmark positions, but not their identity; Fig. 2b). The ANN performed as well as a near Bayes-optimal particle filter (Fig. 2b), outperforming path integration with correction (corresponding to continuous path integration13,14 with boundary/landmark resetting15,16) and represented multimodal hypotheses, transitioning from a no-information state (in LM0) to a bimodal two-hypothesis coding state (LM1) and finally to a full information, one-hypothesis coding state (LM2) (Fig. 2c,d and Extended Data Fig. 5). Bimodal hypothesis states did not emerge when the ANN was given the landmark identity (Extended Data Fig. 5h–k). Together, this shows that recurrent neural dynamics are sufficient to internally generate, retain and apply hypotheses to reason across time based on ambiguous sensory and motor information, with no external disambiguating inputs.

Both ANN and RSC neurons encoded several navigation variables conjunctively (Extended Data Fig. 2b) and transitioned from encoding egocentric landmark-relative position during LM1 to a more allocentric encoding during LM2 (Extended Data Fig. 6). Instantaneous position uncertainty (variance derived from particle filter) could be decoded from ANN activity (Extended Data Fig. 5l), analogous to RSC (Fig. 1e). ANN neurons preferentially represented landmark locations (Extended Data Fig. 2c; consistent with overrepresentation of reward sites in hippocampus17,18), but we did not observe this effect in RSC. Average spatial tuning curves of ANN neurons were shallower in the LM1 state relative to LM2, corresponding to trial-by-trial ‘disagreements' between neurons, evident as bimodal rates per location. RSC rates similarly became less variable across trials per location in LM2 (Extended Data Fig. 7), indicating that, in addition to the explicit encoding of hypotheses/uncertainty (Fig. 1e,g), there is a higher degree of trial-to-trial variability in RSC as a function of spatial uncertainty.

The ANN computed, retained and used multimodal hypotheses to interpret otherwise ambiguous inputs: after encountering the first landmark, the travel direction and distance to the second is sufficient to identify it as ‘a' or ‘b' (Figs. 1b and 2a). There are four possible scenarios for the sequence of landmark encounters: ‘a' then ‘b', or ‘b' then ‘a', for CW or CCW travel directions, respectively. To understand the mechanism by which hypothesis encoding enabled disambiguation, we examined the moment when the second landmark becomes visible and can be identified (Fig. 2a). We designate LM1 states in which the following second landmark is ‘a' as ‘LM1a' and those that lead to ‘b' as ‘LM1b.' Despite trial-to-trial variance resulting from random exploration trajectories and initial poses, ANN hidden unit activity fell on a low-dimensional manifold (correlation dimension d ≈ 3; Fig. 3d) and could be well captured in a three-dimensional (3D) embedding using principal component analysis (PCA) (Fig. 2d). Activity states during the LM0,1,2 phases (green, blue and gray/red, respectively) were distinct, and transitions between phases (mediated by identical landmark encounters; black arrows) clustered into discrete locations. Examining representative trajectories (for the CCW case; Fig. 2e) reveals that LM1a and LM1b states are well-separated in activity space. If the second landmark appears at the shorter CCW displacement (corresponding to the ‘a' to ‘b' interval), the state jumps to the ‘b' coding point on the LM2 attractor (Fig. 2e). On the other hand, the absence of a landmark at the shorter displacement causes the activity to traverse LM1a, until the second landmark causes a jump onto the ‘a' coding location on the LM2 attractor. In both cases, an identical transient landmark input pushes the activity from distinct hypothesis-encoding regions of activity space onto different appropriate locations in the LM2 state, constituting successful localization.

a, Correlation structure in ANN activity is maintained across task phases, indicating maintained low-dimensional neural dynamics across different computational regimes. Top, pairwise ANN tuning correlations in LM1 and LM2 (same ordering, by preferred location). Bottom, tuning curve pairs (normalized amplitude). b, Same analysis as a, but for RSC in one session (N = 64 neurons, computed on entire spike trains, sorted via clustering in LM1). The reorganization of spatial coding as hypotheses are updated (Fig. 1d,f) is constrained by the stable pairwise structure of RSC activity. Neurons remain correlated (first and second pair) or anticorrelated (third and fourth pair) across LM1 and LM2. c, Summary statistics (session median and quartiles) for maintenance of correlations across task phases. This also extends to a separate visually guided dot-hunting task (Extended Data Fig. 8). d, Activity in both the ANN and RSC is locally low-dimensional, through correlation dimension (the number of points in a ball of some radius grows with radius to the power of N if data is locally N-dimensional) on 20 principal components. See Extended Data Fig. 8 for analysis by PCA.

We next consider the nature of the dynamics and representation that allows the circuit to encode the same angular position variables across LM1 and LM2 regimes while also encoding the different hypotheses required to disambiguate identical landmarks. Does the latter drive the network to functionally reorganize throughout the computation? Or, does the former, together with the need to maintain and use the internal hypotheses across time, require the network to exhibit stable low-dimensional recurrent attractor dynamics? To test this, we computed the pairwise correlations of the ANN activity states (Fig. 3a) and found them to be well conserved across LM1 and LM2 states. As these correlation matrices are the basis for projections into low-dimensional space, this shows that the same low-dimensional dynamics were maintained, despite spanning different computational and hypothesis-encoding regimes (metastable two-state encoding with path integration in LM1 versus stable single-state path integration unchanged by further landmark inputs in LM2; Extended Data Fig. 5). Low-dimensional pairwise structure was also conserved across different landmark configurations and varied ANN architectures, and the low-dimensionality of ANN states was robust to large perturbations (Extended Data Fig. 5w). In sum, these computations were determined by one stable set of underlying recurrent network dynamics, which, together with appropriate self-motion and landmark inputs, can maintain and update hypotheses to disambiguate identical landmarks over time, with no need for external inputs.

We hypothesized that RSC and its reciprocally connected brain regions may, similarly to the ANN, use internal hypotheses to resolve landmark ambiguities using recurrent dynamics. Using the ANN as a template for a minimal dynamical system that can solve the task (Fig. 2), we asked whether neural activity in RSC is consistent with a system that could solve the task with the same mechanisms. To be described as a dynamical system, neural activity must first be sufficiently constrained by a stable set of dynamics, that is, the activity of neurons must be sufficiently influenced by that of other neurons, and these relationships must be maintained over time1. To test this property, we first computed pairwise rate correlations and found a preserved structure between LM1 and LM2, as in the ANN (median R (across sessions) of Rs (across cells) = 0.74 in RSC, versus 0.73 in ANN; Fig. 3c). Firing rates could be predicted from rates of other neurons, using pairwise rate relationships across task phases; this maintained structure also extended to the visual dot-hunting behavior (Extended Data Fig. 8). Because pairwise correlations form the basis of dimensionality reduction, this shows that low-dimensional RSC activity is coordinated by the constraints of stable recurrent neural dynamics and not a feature of a specific behavioral task or behavior.

To employ neural firing rates as states of a dynamical system that act as memory and computational substrates in the same manner as in the ANN, they should also be low-dimensional. Consistent with the stable relationships between neurons, most RSC population activity was low-dimensional (around six significant principal components, and correlation dimension of around 5.4; Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 8), similar to findings in hippocampus19. Together, we find that despite significant changes in neural encoding as different hypotheses are entertained across task phases (Fig. 1d–f and Extended Data Figs. 3f and 2a) and across different tasks (Extended Data Fig. 4a–d), the evolution of firing rates in RSC is constrained by stable dynamics that could implement qualitatively similar states as the ANN.

To compute with a dynamical system, states that act as memory need to affect how the system reacts to further input. The ANN solves the task using distinct hypothesis states that are updated with visual inputs and locomotion, by placing them in the state space so that visual input arriving at different hypothesis states within LM1 (LM1a versus LM1b) pushes activity onto the correct states in LM2 (Fig. 2). We examined this process in RSC by first looking at the evolution of neural states during the spatial reasoning process. States evolved at speeds correlated with animal locomotion, consistent with the observation that hypotheses are updated by self-motion in between landmark encounters and were driven by landmark encounters consistent with findings in head-fixed tasks11 (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Neural states were also driven by failures to encounter landmarks at expected positions, which can also be informative (Fig. 2e, right), albeit with a different neural encoding than we observed for encountering the landmarks (Extended Data Fig. 2e).

We next tested whether sufficiently separated neural states, LM1a and LM1b, together with stable low-dimensional attractor dynamics could resolve the identity of the second landmark. If so, this would suggest that, as in the ANN, the ensemble activity state in RSC can serve both as memory and affect future computations. We identified subsets of trials in which mouse motion around the LM1 to LM2 transition was matched closely and aligned them in time to the point when the second landmark became visible (Fig. 4a). In these trials, locomotion and visual inputs are matched, and only the preceding hypothesis state (LM1a or b) differs. RSC firing rates differed between LM1a and LM1b states, as did subsequent rates in LM2 (comparing within- to across-group distances in neural state space across matched trials, and by decoding state from firing rates: Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 9i,j).

a, Top, to study hypothesis encoding and its impact without sensory or motor confounds, we used trials with matched egocentric paths just before and after the second landmark (‘a' or ‘b') encounter. One example session is shown. Bottom, 3D neural state space trajectories (isomap); RSC latent states do not correspond directly to those of the ANN. b, RSC encodes the difference between LM1a and LM1b, and between subsequent LM2 states, as in the ANN (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 5). Blue, within-group and grey, across-group distances in neural state space. Horizontal lines, mean; boxes, 95% CIs (bootstrap). State can also be decoded from raw spike rates (Extended Data Fig. 9j). c, Neural dynamics in RSC are smooth across trials: pairwise distances between per trial spike counts in a 750 ms window before LM2 onset remain correlated with later windows; line, median; shading, CIs (bootstrap). d, RSC activity preceding the second landmark encounter predicts correct/incorrect port choice (horizontal line, mean; gray shaded box, 95% CI from bootstrap, cross-validated regression trees). e, Decoding of hypothesis states and position from RSC using ANNs to illustrate the evolution of neural activity in the task-relevant space (see b, c and d and Fig. 1e,f, Extended Data Fig. 9 statistics). f, Schematic of potential computational mechanisms. Left, if RSC encodes only current spatial and sensorimotor states and no hypotheses beyond landmark count (LM1a or LM2b, derived from seeing the first landmark and self-motion integration that lead to identifying the second landmark as ‘a' or ‘b'), an external disambiguating input is needed. Right, because task-specific hypotheses arising from the learned relative position of the landmarks are encoded (this figure), and activity follows stable attractor dynamics (Fig. 3), ambiguous visual inputs can drive the neural activity to different positions, disambiguating landmark identity in RSC analogously to the ANN.

To compute with the same mechanism as the ANN, neural states must be governed by stable dynamics consistently enough for current states to reliably influence future states, which requires that nearby states do not diffuse or mix too quickly1. We found that RSC firing rates were predictable across trials such that neighboring trials in activity space remained neighbors (Fig. 4c), which further confirms stable recurrent dynamics, that these states can be used as computational substrate, and indicates a topological organization of abstract task variables19. This indicates that stably maintained hypothesis-encoding differences in firing over LM1 could interact with ambiguous visual landmark inputs to push neural activity from distinct starting points in neural state space to points that correspond to correct landmark interpretations, as in the ANN.

The ANN achieved high correct rates, but mice make mistakes. If the dynamical systems interpretation holds, such mistakes would be explainable by LM1a or b states that are not in the right location, and lead to the wrong LM2 interpretation. Indeed, we observed that neural trajectories from LM1a that were close in activity space to LM1b were dragged along LM1b trajectories and vice-versa (they had similar movement directions; Extended Data Fig. 9g,h), suggesting that behavioral landmark identification outcomes might be affected by how hypotheses were encoded in RSC during LM1. We tested this hypothesis and found that RSC activity in LM1 (last 5 s preceding the transition to LM2) was predictive of the animal's behavioral choice of the correct versus incorrect port (Fig. 4d). Notably, this behaviorally predictive hypothesis encoding was absent during training in sessions with low task performance (Extended Data Fig. 4), indicating that the dynamical structures and hypothesis states observed in RSC were task-specific and acquired during learning.

Our unrestrained nonstereotyped behavior is not amenable to direct comparison of activity trajectories between ANNs and the brain as others have done in highly stereotyped trials of macaque behavior1. Instead, we found that the dynamics of firing rates in mouse RSC are consistent with, and sufficient for, implementing hypothesis-based disambiguation of identical landmarks using a similar computational mechanism as observed in the ANN.

We report that RSC represents internal spatial hypotheses, sensory inputs and their interpretation and fulfills the requirements for computing and using hypotheses to disambiguate landmark identity using stable recurrent dynamics. Specifically, we found that low-dimensional recurrent dynamics were sufficient to perform spatial reasoning (that is to form, maintain and use hypotheses to disambiguate landmarks over time) in an ANN (Fig. 2 and also see Extended Data Fig. 10 for non-negative ANNs and when no map input was given). We then found that RSC fulfills the requirements for such dynamics, that is, encoding of the required variables (Figs. 1 and 4) with stable low-dimensional (Fig. 3) and smooth dynamics that predicted behavioral outcomes (Fig. 4). Due to the higher trial-to-trial variability and lower number of recorded cells, we do not draw direct connections between specific latent states of the ANN and neural data, as was done in previous studies in primates2,3,20 or simpler mouse tasks19,21.

We observed that local dynamics in RSC can disambiguate sensory inputs based on internally generated and maintained hypotheses without relying on external context inputs at the time of disambiguation (Fig. 4), indicating that RSC can derive hypotheses over time and combine these hypotheses with accumulating evidence from the integration of self-motion (for example, paths after the first landmark encounter) and sensory stimuli to solve a spatiotemporally extended spatial reasoning task. These results do not argue for RSC as an exclusive locus of such computations. There is evidence for parallel computations, likely at different levels of abstraction, across subcortical22 and cortical regions such as PFC3,23,24, PPC25, LIP26 and visual27,28 areas. Further, hippocampal circuits contribute to spatial computations beyond representing space by learning environmental topology29 and constraining spatial coding using attractor dynamics19,30,31 shaped by previous experience32. Finally, the landmark disambiguation that we observed probably interacts with lower sensory areas33, reward value9,34 and action selection computations21,35.

The emergence of conjunctive encoding, explicit hypothesis codes and similar roles for dynamics across RSC and the ANN suggests that spatial computations and, by extension, cognitive processing in neocortex may be constrained by simple cost functions36, similar to sensory37 or motor38 computations. The ANN does not employ sampling-based representations, which have been proposed as possible mechanisms for probabilistic computation39,40, showing that explicit representation of hypotheses and uncertainty as separate regions in rate space could serve as alternative or supplementary mechanism to sampling.

A key open question is how learning a specific environment, task or behavioral context occurs. We observed that hypothesis coding emerges with task learning (Extended Data Fig. 4). Possible, and not mutually exclusive, mechanisms include: (1) changes of the stable recurrent dynamics in RSC, as is suggested in hippocampal CA1 (ref. 29); (2) modification of dynamics by context-specific tonic inputs3,20; or (3) changes in how hypotheses and sensory information are encoded and read out while maintaining attractor dynamics that generalize across environments or tasks, as indicated by the maintenance of recurrent structure across tasks in our data (Extended Data Fig. 8) and as has been shown in entorhinal30 and motor cortex38 and ANNs41,42, possibly helped by the high-dimensional mixed nature of RSC representations43,44. Further, how such processes are driven by factors such as reward expectation34 is an active area of research.

Our findings show that recurrent dynamics in neocortex can simultaneously represent and compute with task and environment-specific multimodal hypotheses in a way that gives appropriate meaning to ambiguous data, possibly serving as a general mechanism for cognitive processes.

Lightweight drive implants with 16 movable tetrodes were built as described previously12. The tetrodes were arranged in an elongated array of approximately 1,250 × 750 µm, with an average distance between electrodes of 250 µm. Tetrodes were constructed from 12.7-µm nichrome wire (Sandvik–Kanthal, QH PAC polyimide coated) with an automated tetrode twisting machine45 and gold-electroplated to an impedance of approximately 300 kΩ.

Mice (male, C57BL/6 RRID: IMSR_JAX:000664) were aged 8–15 weeks at the time of surgery. Animals were housed in pairs or triples when possible and maintained on a 12-h cycle, at 65–70 °F with ~60% humidity. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines and with the approval of the Committee on Animal Care at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). All surgeries were performed under aseptic conditions under stereotaxic guidance. Mice were anesthetized with isofluorane (2% induction, 0.75–1.25% maintenance in 1 l min−1 oxygen) and secured in a stereotaxic apparatus. A heating pad was used to maintain body temperature; additional heating was provided until fully recovered. The scalp was shaved, wiped with hair-removal cream and cleaned with iodine solution and alcohol. After intraperitoneal (IP) injection of dexamethasone (4 mg kg−1), carprofen (5 mg kg−1), subcutaneous injection of slow-release buprenorphine (0.5 mg kg−1) and local application of lidocaine, the skull was exposed. The skull was cleaned with ethanol, and a thin base of adhesive cement (C&B Metabond and Ivoclar Vivadent Tetric EvoFlow) was applied. A stainless steel screw was implanted superficially anterior of bregma to serve as electrical ground.

A 3-mm craniotomy was drilled over central midline cortex, a durotomy was performed on one side of the central sinus and tetrode drives12 were implanted above RSC, at around anterior–posterior (AP) −1.25 to −2.5 mm and medio–lateral (ML) 0.5 mm, with the long axis of the tetrode array oriented AP and the tetrode array tilted inwards at an angle of ~15–20° and fixed with dental cement. The ground connection on the drive was connected to the ground screw, and the skin around the drive implant was brought over the base layer of adhesive as much as possible to minimize the resulting open wound, sutured and secured with surgical adhesive.

At the time of implant surgery, only two of the tetrodes were extended from the drive to serve as guides during the procedure. All other tetrodes were lowered into superficial layers of cortex within 3 days postsurgery. Mice were given 1 week to recover before the start of recordings.

After implant surgery, individual tetrodes were lowered over the course of several days until a depth corresponding to layer 5 was reached and spiking activity was evident. Data were acquired with an Open Ephys46 ONIX47 prototype system at 30 kHz using the Bonsai software48 (v.2.2; https://bonsai-rx.org/). The tether connecting the mouse headstage to the acquisition system was routed through a commutator above the arena and was counterbalanced using a segment of flexible rubber tread. Tetrodes were occasionally lowered by small increments of ~50 µm to restore good recording conditions or to ensure sampling of new cells across sessions.

Voltage data from the 16 tetrodes, sampled at 30 kHz were bandpass filtered at 300–6,000 Hz, and a median of the voltage across all channels that were well connected to tetrode contacts was subtracted from each channel to reduce common-mode noise such as licking artifacts.

Spike sorting was then performed per tetrode using the Mountainsort software49 (https://github.com/flatironinstitute/mountainsort_examples), and neurons were included for further analysis if they had a noise overlap score <0.05, an isolation score >0.75 (provided by Mountainsort49), a clear refractory period (to ensure spikes originated from single neurons), a spike waveform with one peak and a clear asymmetry (to exclude recordings from passing axon segments) and a smooth voltage waveform and ISI (inter spike interval) histogram (to exclude occasional spike candidates driven by electrical noise). Units were not excluded based on firing rates, tuning or any higher order firing properties. The number of simultaneously recorded cells per mouse for the main analyses was as follows. Blackdot, 52,53,54,49; Gothmog, 55,59,52,51,51,85; Nodot, 65,86,72,69; Unnamed1, 67,64; Total, 984. For the entire dataset analyzed in the analysis over learning (Extended Data Fig. 4), a larger number of cells, and of simultaneously recorded cells, were collected, and sessions with <50 cells were included.

To verify the localization of the recording sites (Extended Data Fig. 3), electrolytic lesions were created by passing currents of 20 µA through a subset of tetrodes (roughly four tetrodes per animal) for 30 s each under isoflurane anesthesia, and animals were perfused and brain processed 1 h later. Brains were mounted with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and imaged.

Behavior was carried out in a circular arena of 50-cm diameter. The floor of the arena was formed by a clear acrylic sheet, under which a diffusion screen and a flat-screen TV was positioned on which visual stimuli were displayed. The circular arena wall was formed by 32 flat black acrylic segments, every other one of which contained an opening for a recessed reward ports, 16 in total. Each reward port contained an optical beam break (880-nm infrared (IR), invisible to mouse) that detected if a mouse was holding its nose in the port, a computer-controlled syringe pump for water reward delivery and a dedicated beeper as a secondary reward indicator. The behavior arena was housed in a soundproof and light-insulated box with no indicators that could allow the mice to establish their heading. Video was acquired by a central overhead camera at 30 Hz using a low level of infrared light at 850 nm and the mouse position was tracked using the oat software50 (https://github.com/jonnew/Oat). A custom behavioral control state machine written in Python was triggered every time a new camera frame was acquired, and the position of the animal, time passed and port visits were used to transition the logic of the state machine (Extended Data Fig. 1). For analysis purposes, all behavioral data was resampled to 100 Hz and synchronized to the electrophysiological data.

For pharmacological inactivation of RSC (Extended Data Fig. 1i–l), four mice were trained on a simplified parametric task that permitted us to causally test the role of RSC in individual recording and inactivation sessions. The task required integration of an allocentric position hypothesis with visual landmarks (Extended Data Fig. 1i,j). After mice learned the task—quantified as reaching a hit rate of above 30% in the simple conditions (high eccentricity; Extended Data Fig. 1j)—they were given access to unrestricted water and implanted following the procedure described for the main experiment but, instead of a chronic drive implant, a removable cap was implanted and two burr holes were prepared above RSC and covered with dental cement (Extended Data Fig. 1k). After recovery from surgery, mice were put back on water restriction over the course of 1 week and reintroduced to the task. Before each experiment, mice were anesthetized briefly with isoflurane, the cap was opened temporarily and the exposed skull was wiped with lidocaine and an injection of either 50 nl of 1 μg ml−1 muscimol solution in cortex buffer per side, or the same volume of cortex solution was performed through the existing burr holes. Mice were left to recover from anesthesia for 15 min and tested on the task. Performance was assessed as the hit rate on the first port visit per trial, and confidence level were computed using the Clopper–Pearson method for binomial confidence intervals (CIs) at the 95% level.

After mice had undergone surgery, they were given at least 1 week to recover before water scheduling began. Initially, mice received 3 ml of water per day in the form of 3 g of HydroGel (ClearH2O), which was reduced gradually to 1.0–1.5 g per day. During this period, mice were handled by experimenters and habituated to the arena. Throughout the entire experiment mice were given water rewards for completion of the task and were given additional water to maintain their total water intake at 1.25–1.5 ml.

After initial acclimation to the recording arena over 2 days, mice were trained on the task. Throughout the task we used white circular cues on the floor (referred to as landmarks) of ~30-mm diameter on a black background. These landmarks were the only source of light in the experiment. Mice were run every day or every other day, for a single session of 30 min to 3 h per day. Training progressed in several phases:

Initially, mice were trained that circular visual cues on the floor of the arena indicated reward locations. One of the 16 ports was selected randomly as reward port and a cue was shown in front of this port. Visiting an incorrect port resulted in a time out (~1 s initially, increased later), during which the entire arena floor was switched to gray leading to a widespread visual stimulus. Visiting the correct port resulted in an audible beep from the beeper located in the port and around 0.005 ml of water were delivered by the syringe pump. After a reward, a new reward port was chosen randomly, and the landmark was rotated together with the port, effectively performing a rotation of the entire task, and the next trial began. This meant that mice learned to not rely on any cues other than the visual landmark to locate the correct port. Mice usually completed this phase in by day 4.

We then introduced a new task phase, referred to in the text as ‘dot-hunting' task: after each reward, the landmark disappeared and instead a blinking dot was shown in a random location in the arena. If the mouse walked over that dot, it disappeared and either a new dot in a new random location appeared, repeating the process, or the next trial was initiated. The number of required dots–chases was sampled uniformly from a range and was increased to six to eight by the time recordings began, and the last dot was always positioned at the arena center. This task phase served to obfuscate the rotation of the task. Data acquired during this task phase were used during spike sorting but were not part of the main dataset in which we analyzed hypothesis representation. We analyze this task phase separately in Fig. 3c and Extended Data Figs. 3h,i, 4 and 8. Mice learned this task phase, with six to eight dots, by day 7 on average.

Throughout phases 1 and 2, we progressively introduced a requirement for the mice to hold their snouts in the reward port for increasing durations to trigger a reward or time out. For each port visit, the required duration was drawn randomly from a uniform distribution, so on any given trial the mice did not know when exactly to expect to know the outcome of the port visit. Initially, this hold time was 500 ms, and the time range was slowly increased throughout training, depending on animal performance. By the time recordings began, a range of around 4–6 s was used. Mice were able to tolerate this holding time by day 20 on average.

Next, we introduced an identical second landmark at a nonrewarded port. Initially, the two landmarks were set two ports apart (for example, ports 1 and 3), and this distance was progressively increased to four or five ports. As before, the rewarded port and landmarks were rotated randomly after each trial, but their relative positions remained stable. Visiting the reward port at the incorrect, ‘a' landmark (and holding there for the required duration) was handled identically to visits to any other nonreward port and triggered the same time out. As a result, mice learned to visit the ‘b' port. Mice learned to make an initial distinction between the ports approximately by day 14–16. In one mouse, we maintained this training phase until overall task performance was significant over entire sessions (Extended Data Fig. 1f), but we noticed that the mouse had trouble consistently relearning the next task phase. We therefore transitioned subsequent mice to the next phases before a stable behavior was established.

After the mice started learning to visit the port at the ‘b' landmark, we introduced a view distance limitation that made landmarks invisible from far away: the mouse's position was tracked at 30 Hz and, for each landmark, its brightness was modulated in real time as a function of the mouse's distance from it. The visibility was 0 for distances above a threshold, 1 for distances below a second threshold and transitioned linearly between the two values. For clarity, we draw only the first threshold where landmarks initially become visible in the illustrations. The second threshold was typically set to about 50% of the first, leading to a gradual brightening, but in the otherwise totally dark arena, almost any values >1 are clearly visible. Initially, thresholds were set so that both landmarks were visible from the arena center (~20 cm); they were then reduced progressively to values where, at any one time, only one of the landmarks was visible to the mouse (~10 cm). At this stage, mice that encounter a landmark after a new trial starts have no way of knowing whether this is the rewarded or nonrewarded landmark, unless they infer landmark identity via path integration (See Fig. 2e right or Extended Data Fig. 2e). Recordings began when mice were able to complete 100 trials per hour at a hit/miss rate >1. Mice reached this criterion level on average by total day 30–40 of training.

Statistical tests were carried out in Matlab (Mathworks, v.2019) using built-in functions. Unless stated otherwise, CIs were computed at a 95% level using bootstrap, and P values were computed using a Mann–Whitney U test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. In figures, significance values are indicated as nonsignificant (NS) (P > 0.05), *(P ≤ 0.05), **(P ≤ 0.01) or ***(P ≤ 0.001). No statistical method was used to predetermine sample sizes.

Recording sessions were included once mice performed the task well enough to achieve a session average hit/miss ratio >1, indicating that mice could infer the correct port between the ‘a' and ‘b' landmarks (a correct rate of >1/16 would indicate that they can associate landmarks with rewarded ports, but not that they can infer landmark identity). Because landmarks are visible sequentially only after full training, a ratio >1 shows that mice employed a memory based strategy where they used a previous hypothesis derived from seeing or not seeing the first landmark, together with path integration, to infer the identity of the second landmark they encounter. Only sessions with at least 50 recorded single neurons, and with at least 50 min of task performance were included. This yielded 16 sessions from four mice. For some analyses, particularly for analyses where trajectories of the mice were matched across trial types to control for potential motor and sensory confounds, additional selection criteria were applied yielding a lower number of sessions that could be used, this is stated for the respective analyses. For plots of the learning rates, we included trials where mice encountered their first landmark after 20 s or faster to exclude periods where mice were not engaged.

For analysis, each trial was split into epochs: the time between the onset of a trial (right after the mouse completes the preceding reinitialization procedure, and finds itself at the center of the arena, unsure of its orientation relative to the currently invisible landmarks) and the onset of the reward (the first time the mouse could know whether it reached the correct port, other than by process of elimination after visiting all other ports) was split up based on the amount of information the mouse could have accumulated: the initial state when mice had not seen any landmark was labeled ‘LM0,' time after the first landmark encounter was labelled ‘LM1,' and after the second encounter as ‘LM2'. The timepoints when landmarks became visible and the mouse transitioned from LM0 to LM1 or from LM1 to LM2, referred to as ‘landmark encounters' were defined as the timepoint when landmark visibility exceeded 50%.

For analyses of the correlation of neural state and eventual behavioral outcomes, each second landmark encounter was further categorized as whether it occurred at the ‘a' or ‘b' landmark. For behavioral analyses in Fig. 4d, trials were further categorized by whether they led to a correct port visit or to a incorrect visit and a time out.

Changes in spatial tuning in individual RSC neurons as mice encounter successive landmarks (Fig. 1f) was quantified by the Euclidian distance of their spatial tuning profiles (in an 8 × 8 map, resulting in a 64-element vector, for each comparison nonvisited ties were omitted). As an internal control, distance between tuning profiles within condition and across condition were compared using nonoverlapping 1-min segments. The control levels are different between the cases because the amount of data per session, reliability of firing, and so on, is not constant, and each control is valid only for its test data. For each comparison (LM1 versus LM2 and LM0 versus LM1), the split spatial tuning maps were compared either within the conditions, for example, within LM1 and within LM2, and compared with distances between LM1 and LM2 maps.

All decoding analyses were performed on the entire neural population with no preselection. To decode the mouse position from RSC firing rates, neural firing rates were first low-pass filtered at 1 Hz with a single-pole Butterworth filter. The resulting firing rate time series were used to predict the mouse position as 100 categorical variables forming a 10 × 10 bin grid (bin width = 50 mm). The network was made up of a single long short-term memory (LSTM) layer with 20 units, and a fully connected layer into a softmax output into the 100 possible output categories. For analyses of intermediate information content of the decoder, the network input into the final softmax layer was analyzed.

Decoding was reinitialized for each trial. For each decoded trial, all other trials served as training set. For analysis of how the neural coding of position was dependent on the landmark state of the mouse (Extended Data Fig. 2a), the same analysis was repeated with training and testing data further divided by landmark state. For analysis of the decoding performance, the output likelihood from the decoder was evaluated at the mouse's true position for all positions that were shared across conditions for this session. Statistical analysis was then performed on a per session average likelihood (not weighted by number of trials per session).

For the analysis of landmark state (Fig. 1e), trials with at least 0.5 s of data from all three states were used (16 sessions, 486 total trials) and individual trials were held out from training for decoding. Firing rates were low-pass filtered with a causal single-pole Butterworth filter at 0.05 Hz, and landmark state (0, 1 or 2) was decoded independently for each timepoint using a categorical linear decoder (dummy variable coding, (Nneurons + 1) × 3 parameters), or a neural network with no recurrence, using a single 20-unit layer receiving instantaneous firing rates, into a six unit layer and into three softmax outputs. Training data were balanced across conditions. For related analyses of hypothesis state decoding, see also Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 9j, where we decode form position-matched timepoints to account for location, motor and visual confounds, and Extended Data Fig. 7 where we match for position.

To show that mice can gain information by not encountering a landmark (as is shown, for example, by the ANN example in Fig. 2), we analyzed cases where the mouse first encounters a landmark, and then, in the LM1 state, encounters the position where another landmark could be, but fails to see one. We note that this analysis has unavoidable confounds, as in one condition the mouse gets salient visual input, in the other it does not. We consequently ignored these cases in the main analysis, and instead concentrated on cases where visual input was matched, but previous hypotheses differ (Fig. 4). We analyze these nonencounters by decoding the associated state change with the same method as in ‘Neural decoding of landmark state,' but with nonbalanced conditions, due to the lower trial count, and analysis of the prediction around the 0-s point.

PCA was performed by first computing the covariance matrices of the low-pass filtered (as before) firing rates, and plotting their eigenvalue spectra, normalized by sum (Extended Data Fig. 8c). Each scaled eigenvalue corresponds to a proportion of explained variance. Spectra are plotted together with a control spectrum computed from covariances of randomly shuffled data. For a description of the method used to compute the correlation dimension of RSC rates (Extended Data Fig. 8d), see the heading ‘Correlation dimension' in the section about ANN methods below.

For quantification of the independence of individual RSC neurons from the surrounding RSC population (Extended Data Fig. 8f,g), the firing rates of each neuron were predicted from those of all other neurons using linear regression. Rates were first filtered at 0.01–0.5 Hz with a third-order Butterworth filter, and subsampled to 3.3 Hz. Each neuron's rate was predicted with L1 regularized linear regression51 (\({\rm{lasso}},\lambda \approx 0.0001\)) from the rates of all other neurons and preceding firing rates using eight lags (~0.2.5 s). Goodness of fit was quantified as the proportion of variance explained, \({R}^{2}=1-{\sum }_{i}{({Y}_{i}-{Y}_{i}^{{\rm{pred}}})}^{2}/{\sum }_{i}{\left({Y}_{i}-\bar{Y}\right)}^{2}\). Predictions were computed both within condition (LM1, LM2 and dot-hunting phase), as well as across conditions, where the model was fit using coefficients determined from the other conditions.

Entropies of empirical firing rate distributions were computed in bits according to their Shannon entropy, \(H\left(X\right)=-{\sum }_{i=1}^{n}P\left({x}_{i}\right){\log }_{2}P({x}_{i})\), relative to a uniform histogram of the same size, \(\hat{H}\left(X\right)=-\left(H\left(X\right)-H\left({\rm{uniform}}\right)\right)\). In cases where zeros appeared, a small offset term <<1 was added and all histograms were normalized to a sum of 1. For example, \(\hat{H}\left(\left[1,0\right]\right)=\hat{H}\left(\left[1,1,0,0\right]\right)=1\,{\rm{bit}}\), and \(\hat{H}\left(\left[1,1,1,1.3\right]\right)\cong 0.01\,{\rm{bit}}\). For the analysis in Fig. 1g, a 8 × 8 grid was used for spatial coding, and three bins for the state coding. Although the 8 × 8 grid is coarse enough to allow accurate capture of the spatial firing rate profile even for low-rate cells, the resulting estimates could be minimally affected by firing rate differences between neurons.

For analysis of whether partial hypothesis representation in the LM1 state corresponds to trial-by-trial changes in firing rates, evident in bimodal firing rate histograms, histograms of hidden unit firing rates of the ANN, conditioned on binned 1D position are displayed (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Data are from Experiment configuration 2 (‘Overview over experiment configurations used with ANNs'). Tuning curves were calculated using 20 bins of location/displacements and normalized individually for each neuron. The first timestep in each trial and timesteps with nonzero landmark input were excluded from the analysis. For histograms, each condition was binned in 100 column bins and neuron rates in ten row bins. Histograms were normalized to equal sum per column. For analysis of RSC firing rates (Extended Data Fig. 7b–d), we did not observe bimodal rate distributions and instead quantified the dispersion of the rate distributions according to their entropy: firing rates were low-pass filtered at 0.5 Hz to bring them into the timescale of navigation behavior, and firing rate histograms were computed with eight bins spanning from each neurons lowest to highest firing rate per neuron, for each spatial bin in a 4 × 4 grid. Because the computation of histogram entropy is biased by the number of samples, for each spatial bin, the same number of timepoints were used for the LM1 and LM2 conditions. The dispersion of the firing rate distribution was then computed as average entropies per cell across all space bin, and compared across the two conditions.

Firing rate profiles were analyzed in two reference frames, that is, global angle of the mouse in the arena, and relative angle to the last visible landmark. Only timepoints from the foraging state where the distance of mouse from the center of the arena exceeded 70% of the arena diameter were included. Timepoints from the LM1 and LM2 conditions were subsampled to yield matched number of timepoints. Firing rates were analyzed in a −π to π range in six bins by computing their entropy as described before.

Recordings were split into LM[0,1,2] states as before, firing rates were low-pass filtered at 1 Hz, and the Pearson correlation coefficient between each pair of neurons was computed. For display purposes, the neurons were reordered by first computing the matrix for the LM1 state, applying hierarchical clustering52, and the resulting reordering was applied to both LM1 and LM2 conditions. This reordering has no impact on any further analyses. For summary statistics, we computed the correlation of correlations for each session. We observed no systematic change in the results as a function of the low-pass cutoff frequency, see Extended Data Fig. 8e for a comparison of a 1-Hz versus a 5-Hz cutoff.

Neural firing rates were bandpass filtered as before, and an initial smoothing and dimensionality reduction step was performed by training a small LSTM with a single layer of 30 units to decode the mouse position. The hidden unit activations were then embedded in 3D space with the isomap algorithm53, using the Toolbox for Dimensionality Reduction by Laurens van der Maaten54.

For quantification of how fast the neural state evolves, the firing rates of the entire population were computed by low-pass filtering the spike trains at 1 Hz (third-order Butterworth filter), and the speed of the five largest principal components of the resulting vector in Hz s−1 were related to the running speed of the mouse (m s−1, also low-pass filtered at 1 Hz) or the change in landmark brightness (percent per second) (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Data were binned in 30 bins from 0 to 0.5 m s−1 and ten bins from 0.5 to 2 m s−1 for running speed and ten bins from −50 to 50% and ten bins for ±50–200%. CIs were computed by treating median data from each session as independent samples.

To study the encoding of context with minimal sensory and motor confounds (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 9), we split the appearances of the second landmark into two groups depending on whether the second landmark is ‘a' or ‘b,' as described in the main text. We then selected subsets of trials manually where egocentric paths just before the appearance of the second landmark are matched across the two groups. Figure 4a shows an example of such matched approach paths/trials. Sessions in which at least 16 trials could be matched were used for these analyses, yielding a total of 133 trials from six sessions (per session, 16, 23, 24, 24, 25 and 21). For each session, all of these trials were aligned to the time when the second landmark became visible, yielding a set of time ranges where the animals experienced similar visual inputs, performed similar locomotion behavior but potentially encoded different previous experience leading them to subsequently disambiguate the perceptually identical second landmark as ‘a' or ‘b.'

To test whether there was consistent encoding of this context in RSC, we then compared the distances across these groups in 3D neural activity space (‘Low-dimensional embedding of neural activity') to distances within the groups (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 9). This test was performed at the point where the second landmark became visible to assess encoding of previous context, as well as 200 ms afterwards to assess how the identity of the (now visible) landmark affects encoding in RSC.

To assess whether neural trajectories were determined by population dynamics that were stable across trials and could therefore serve as substrate for the computation performed by the mice, we tested whether neural trajectories behaved consistent with a laminar flow regime where neighboring particles (in our case, neural firing rate vectors) remain neighbors for a significant amount of time, or whether they decorrelate quickly (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 9e,f). To assess temporal dynamics of the neural spiking without imposing any smoothing, we investigated raw spike counts in 750-ms windows for this analysis. For each session, an initial set of pairwise high-dimensional distances in spike counts between the trials with egocentrically similar paths (‘Analysis of context-encoding in RSC across similar motor and sensory states') was computed from the last 750 ms preceding the appearance of the second landmark. These distances were then correlated with those in a second sliding window; Extended Data Fig. 9f). An offset of 0 s was defined as the point where both windows stopped overlapping. The correlation coefficient R was then computed for increasing window offset up to 2 s. Summary statistics were computed across sessions by first shifting each session individually by its 95% level for R (from a shuffled control which removed the relationship between cells) which results in the summary plot showing a highest value for R of ~0.8 even for offsets where the windows fully overlap and the uncorrected R value is 1. Because of this offset, the null level for each trial is now at R = 0. We then computed the CIs for the group by bootstrap relative to this level.

To illustrate the joint encoding of position and task states (as sketched conceptually in Fig. 4f) using neural data, we decoded the hypothesis state, as well as x/y position from firing rates (Fig. 4e). Individual trials were held out as test set, an ANN was trained on the remaining trials and the resulting predictions in the test trial were plotted with hypothesis state in z and x/y in x/y dimensions. True LM0, 1a and 1b states were indicated with same colors as throughout the figure. Rates were low-pass-filtered with a causal third-order Butterworth filter at 0.5 Hz to bring rates into the behavioral timescale. For position decoding, the network architecture was filtered rates > 20-unit LSTM layer > 15-unit LSTM > 6-unit LSTM > 2 element regression output (mouse x/y position). For hypothesis states, rates > 10-unit LSTM > single regression layer, with LM0 encoded at 0, and LM1a and b as −1 and +1, respectively. This analysis was not used to make statistical statements. Instead, we tested x/y encoding in Fig. 1, and hypothesis encoding in Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 9 with statistical methods.

To further test whether neural trajectories were determined by population dynamics that were stable across trials, and were independent of the interpretation of the second (locally ambiguous) landmark, we tested whether neural activity evolved in similar directions across trials if it started close together in 3D neural activity space (‘Low-dimensional embedding of neural activity') (Extended Data Fig. 9g,h). We therefore looked at neural trajectories within the motor and sensory-matched LM2 approaches where the neural state at the point where the second landmark became visible started neurally close to other trials from the opposing class. For example, for an LM2a trial, we examined whether this trial might follow other close-by LM2b trials. We computed neural proximity in the 3D neural embedding (see above) and defined close-by trials as ones that were within 1 a.u. in Euclidean distance in the isomap embedding around the time when the second landmark became visible, yielding a total of 42 out of 79 trials with close neighbors from opposing classes from the five sessions (one session was excluded because the neural activity in the relevant time ranges was collapsed onto a point in the LSTM embedding). As a control, we also selected corresponding neurally furthest points. Similarity of neural evolution was then quantified as the angular difference between the trials in (3D) LSTM space over time, to assess coevolution independently of the initial selection by distance. Significance was computed by bootstrap across trials versus random alignments corresponding to a 90-degree difference.

For the behavior prediction analysis, sessions with at least five correct and incorrect port visits after the second landmark visit were used (N = 11) and an equal number of hit and miss trials (outcome of next port visit is a time out or a correct) were selected, leading to a chance prediction level of 0.5. The spike rates from the 5 s preceding the second landmark becoming visible, binned into 1-s bins, were used to predict the behavioral outcome with a binary classification decision tree with a minimum leaf size of six, previously determined using cross-validation. Predictions for each trial were fit using all other trials.

We trained a decoder to predict either the number of encountered dots in the main task, or in the dot-hunting task. These tasks were interleaved, and the same neurons were used (Extended Data Fig. 4). Train and test sets were split by trial, and decoding was performed with a regression tree on low-pass-filtered firing rates as before, performance was quantified as mean error on the number of landmarks. Only the first two landmarks were predicted in the dot-hunting task to allow use of the same classifier across both. Decoding performance was compared between the within-class (for example, decode main task encounters with decoder trained on other trials in the main task) and cross-class (for example, decode dot-hunting from decoder trained on the main task, and so on).

To test whether the encoding of hypothesis states in RSC is specific to task performance, we analyzed a larger number of sessions from the entire period during which two landmarks with local visibility were used (92 recording sessions in total) (Extended Data Fig. 4). We analyzed the effect of task performance on the behavior prediction analysis (as described above; Extended Data Fig. 4). We also analyzed the more general decoding of landmark encounter count (same method as in ‘Specificity of landmark encounter coding to the foraging task'; Fig. 1) in all of the 92 sessions with two landmarks, and correlated decoding performance with task performance on a per session level. As an additional control, we performed the same analysis on the number of dots encountered in the interleaved dot-hunting task. For all of these analyses, we used an analogous method as for the nonbehavior-correlated analyses.

We chose a simple recurrent neural network as one of the simplest architectures that can learn to maintain state over time. Unless stated in the text, the default architecture consisted of rate neurons with an input layer into 128 hidden recurrent units (tanh nonlinearity) into 80 output neurons, trained on random velocity trajectories in random environments of up to four landmarks (see ‘Network architecture and training' for details). For the analyses in the main text, landmark inputs were relayed to the ANN as a map that encoded their relative position but not identity (‘external map' ANN, 80 input neurons). The findings were replicated with an ANN that received only binary landmark presence input (‘internal map' ANN, 11 input neurons) and non-negative ANNs (Extended Data Fig. 10), on a subset of environments. The ANN serves to establish whether and how recurrent systems could solve the task, and we make no connections between the circuitry of RSC and the connections in the ANN.

A simulated animal runs with varying velocity in a circular environment starting from a random unknown position and eventually infers its position using noisy velocity information and two, three or four indistinguishable landmarks. A trial consists of a fixed duration of exploration in a fixed environment, starting from an unknown starting location; the environment can change between trials. Environments are generated by randomly drawing a constellation of two to four landmarks, and the network must generalizably localize in any of these environments when supplied with its map. The network must adjust its spatial inference computations on the basis of the configurations of the different environments, without changing its weights; thus, the adjustments must be dynamic. In the internal map scheme (Extended Data Fig. 10a–m), an input cell simply encodes by its activation whether the animal is at any landmark; it does not specify the location of the landmark, the identity of the environment, or the spatial configuration of the various landmarks in the environment. The task in the internal map scheme is substantially harder, since the network must infer the configuration of landmarks in the environment purely from the time sequence of landmark visits, while simultaneously localizing itself within the environment. Information about the maps must be acquired and stored within the network. To make the task tractable, we limit training and testing in the internal map setting to four specific environments.

In the external map task (Figs. 2 and 3 and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 5–7), landmark locations were random and the set of locations (map) were provided to the network, whereas in the internal map task (Extended Data Fig. 10a–m) one of four landmark configurations was used, but the maps were not provided to the network. Landmarks could be observed only for a short distance. A three-layer network with a recurrent hidden layer was trained to infer location. Velocity and landmark encounter information were encoded in the input layer, and all weights of the network were trained. The training target for the output layer was activation of a unit with von Mises tuning and preferred location matching the true location.

Network performance was compared with a number of alternative algorithms: path integration plus correction integrated the noisy velocity information starting from an initial location guess and corrected this estimate by a reset to the coordinates of the nearest landmark when a landmark was encountered. Particle filters approximated sequential Bayesian inference given the available velocity and landmark information, with each particle capturing a location hypothesis whose posterior probability is given by an associated weight. Particle locations are updated using velocity information and particles are reweighted after landmark encounters. The enhanced particle filter also reweights particles when a landmark is expected but not encountered, thus can infer location not only from the presence but also from the absence of landmarks. The output and hidden representations of the trained network were evaluated in a variety of conditions involving both random and fixed landmark locations and trajectories with random and fixed velocities.

The task is defined by a simulated animal moving along a circular track of radius 0.5 m for 10 s. The animal starts at a random, unknown position along the circle at rest and starts running along a trajectory at nonconstant velocity. A trajectory is sampled every dt = 0.1 s in the following way: at each time t, acceleration at is sampled from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with s.d. σa = π/4 m s−2 that is truncated if |at | > π/2 m s−2. Acceleration is integrated to obtain the velocity vt and truncated if |vt | > vmax = π/2 m s−1. The actual location on the track is the integral of this velocity.

In a trial of the external map task, the locations of K = 2, 3 or 4 indistinguishable landmarks were determined sequentially: the first landmark was sampled from a uniform random distribution on the circle, with subsequent landmarks also sampled from a uniform random distribution but subject to the condition that the minimum angular distance from any previously sampled landmark is at least δ = π/9 rad.

The internal map task involved four environments, each with a unique configuration of landmarks: two environments had two landmarks, one had three and the last had four. Landmark locations in the four environments were chosen so that pairwise angular distances were sufficiently unique to allow the inference of environment identity. Landmark coordinates in environment ei were given by: e1 = {0, 2π/3} rad, e2 = {1.9562, 3.7471} rad, e3 = {0.2641, 1.2920, 3.7243} rad and e4 = {3.0511, 3.8347, 5.1625, 5.7165} rad.

After training, the networks were evaluated in different testing configurations that each consisted of a distribution over landmark configurations and trajectories:

Training distribution: this test set was generated exactly as in the training set, as described in ‘Definition of environments and trajectories'.

Fixed landmarks, random trajectories: the landmark configuration was given by two landmarks located at e = {0, 2π/3}, the trajectories were sampled in an identical way as in the training distribution. Note that this landmark configuration corresponds to the first environment in the internal map task.

Fixed landmarks, constant velocity trajectories: the landmark configuration was given by two landmarks located at e = {0, 2π/3} and the trajectories were given by constant velocity trajectories with |vt | = vmax/2. The initial position and the direction of the trajectory was random.

Two variable landmarks, constant velocity trajectory: the landmark configuration was given by two landmarks located at e = {0, 2π/3 + απ/3}, where α ϵ [0, 1]. The trajectories were given by constant velocity trajectories with |vt | = vmax/2 and the initial position and the direction of the trajectory was random.

Two environments, random trajectories: the landmark configuration was given by either e1 or e2 of the internal map task, trajectories are random.

The animal is considered to have encountered a landmark if it approached within dmin = vmax × dt/2 = π/40 m−2 = π/20 rad. This threshold is large enough to prevent an animal from ‘missing' a landmark even if it is running at maximum velocity. This ‘visibility radius' is smaller than the one we used for the mouse behavior experiments (Fig. 1). In the ANN experiments, landmark encounters were therefore roughly coincident with the agent's position coinciding with the landmark, whereas in the mouse data, landmark encounters occur a significant distance away from the landmark, when it becomes visible (for example, Fig. 4a). In the same way as in the mouse behavior analysis, hovering around the same landmark or approaching the same landmark consecutively would trigger a landmark encounter only at the first approach; a new encounter was triggered only if the animal approached an landmark different from the previous one, equivalent to the definition used in the analysis of mouse behavior. Also, only trials in which the animal encountered at least two different landmarks were included.

The largest sources of uncertainty in the tasks were the unknown starting position and the indistinguishability of the landmarks. In addition, we assumed that the velocity information and the landmark location memory (in the external map scenario) were corrupted by noise. At each timestep of size dt = 0.1, the velocity input to the network corresponded to the true displacement vdt corrupted by zero-mean Gaussian noise of standard deviation σv = vmaxdt/10. In the external map task, the landmark map provided to the network and particle filter was corrupted by zero-mean Gaussian noise with standard deviation σl = π/50 rad, without changing the relative landmark positions: The map was coherently slightly rotated at a landmark encounter, and the rotation was sampled independently at each landmark encounter.

This analysis was performed by evaluating the network of the external map task on the experiment configuration 1 of the internal map task (Extended Data Fig. 2c). First, location tuning curves were determined after the second landmark encounter using 5,000 trials from distribution 1 and using 50 location bins. Tuning curves were calculated separately for each of the four environment of the internal map task. Preferred location was determined to be the location corresponding to the tuning curve maximum. The density of preferred locations smaller than distance dmin away from a landmark was then compared with the density of preferred locations further away from landmarks.

The network consisted of three layers of rate neurons with input-to-hidden, hidden-to-hidden and hidden-to-output weights. All weights were trained.

The input layer consisted of 80 neurons in the external map case and 11 neurons in the internal map case. Ten neurons coded for velocity corrupted by noise (noise as described above). The velocity neurons had a minimum firing rate between 0 and 0.2 and a maximum firing rate between 0.8 and 1 in arbitrary units, and within this output range coded linearly for the whole range of velocity between −vmax and vmax. Negative and positive velocity here corresponds to CW and CCW travel, respectively.

The remaining neurons (70 in the external map case and 1 in the internal map case) coded for landmark input and were activated only at the timestep of, and up to, three timesteps after a landmark encounter. In the external map case, the landmark input simultaneously encoded the locations of all landmarks in the environment, thus supplying a map of the environment, but contained no information about which LM was currently encountered. The LM neurons had von Mises tuning with preferred locations xj = (j − 1) × 2π/70 rad, j = 1…70, that tiled the circle equally. Given n landmarks at locations li, i = 1…n, the firing rate of the j-th landmark input neuron was given by

where \(\widetilde{{l}_{i}}\sim N\left({l}_{i},{\sigma }_{l}^{2}\right)\) is the noise-corrupted landmark coordinate (‘Sensory noise'). This mixture of von Mises activation hills produces the pattern depicted as the ‘map' input in Extended Data Fig. 5a.

In the internal map case (Extended Data Fig. 10a–m), the landmark input neuron consisted of a single binary neuron that responded for four timesteps with activation 1 in arbitrary units whenever a landmark was encountered. This input encoded neither environment identity nor landmark location.

The hidden layer consisted of 128 recurrently connected neurons. The activation ht of hidden layer neurons at timestep t was determined by ht = tanh(Wxxt + Whht − 1 + b), where xt are the activations of input neurons at timestep t, Wx are the input-to-hidden weights, Wh are the hidden-to-hidden weights and b are the biases of hidden neurons. The nonlinearity should be considered as an effective nonlinearity at long times; since the timestep dt = 0.1 s was large compared with a typical membrane time constant (τ ≈ 0.02 s), we did not include an explicit leak term.

In the non-negative network (Extended Data Fig. 10n–t), the recurrent activation was determined by ht = tanh([Wxxt + Whht−1 + b]+), where [u]+ denotes rectification.

The output layer consisted of a population of 70 neurons with activity ot given by ot = tanh(Woht + bo), where Wo are the output weights and bo the biases of the output neurons.

The training targets of the output layer were place cells with von Mises tuning of width σo = π/6 rad to the true location yt,

where zα, α = 1…70 are the equally spaced preferred locations of each training target.

The network was trained by stochastic gradient descent using the Adam algorithm55, to minimize the average square error between output ot and training targets \({\tilde{{o}}_{t}}\), with the average taken over neurons, time within each trial and trials. The gradients were clipped to 100. The training set consisted of 106 independently generated trials. During training, performance was monitored on a validation set of 1,000 independent trials and network parameters with the smallest validation error were selected. All results were cross-validated on a separate set of test trials to ensure that the network generalized across new random trajectories and/or landmark configurations.

Given the activity of the output layer at time t, we define the network location estimate for that time to equal the preferred location (the preferred location was set over training) of the most active output neuron:

In Fig. 2b, we compared the performance of the network in the external map task with a number of alternative algorithms. To ensure a fair comparison, we make sure that each alternative algorithm has access to exactly the same information as the network: the landmark identities are indistinguishable and both velocity and landmark location information are corrupted by the same small amount of sensory noise. Error statistics were computed from 5,000 trials.

This algorithm implements path integration and landmark correction using a single location estimate, similar to what is implemented in hand-designed continuous attractor networks that implement resets at boundaries or other landmarks15,16,56,57. The algorithm starts with an initial location estimate at y = 0 (despite the true initial location being random and unknown), and integrates the noise-corrupted velocity signal to obtain location. At each landmark encounter, the algorithm corrects its location estimate to equal the coordinates of the landmark nearest to its current estimate.

Particle filters implement approximate sequential Bayesian inference using a sampling-based representation of the posterior distribution. Here, the posterior distribution over location at each timepoint is represented using a cloud of weighted particles, each of which encodes through its weights a belief, or estimated probability, of being at a certain location. In the beginning of the trial, Np = 1,000 particles are sampled from a uniform distribution along the circle and weighted equally. In the prediction step, particles are propagated independently using a random walk whose mean is the noise-corrupted velocity update and whose s.d. is the velocity noise σv. In the absence of a landmark encounter, particle weights remain unchanged and the particle cloud diffuses. If a landmark is encountered, the importance weights wt,β of particles β = 1…Np are multiplied by

where yt,β are the current estimates of the particles, and the weights are subsequently normalized such that \({\sum }_{\beta }{w}_{t,\beta }^{2}=1\). If the effective number of particles becomes too small, that is, \({N}_{\text{eff}}=1/{\sum }_{\beta }{w}_{t,\beta }^{2} < {N}_{p}/5\), the particles are resampled using low variance sampling58 and the weights equalized. This resampling step both allows for better coverage of probabilities and permits the particle cloud to sharpen again. The particle filter estimate at a given timepoint is given by the weighted circular mean \({\hat{y}}_{t}={{\arg }}({\sum }_{\beta }{w}_{t,\beta }\exp (i{y}_{t,\beta }))\) of the particle locations. In addition, we also calculate the circular variance as \(\mathrm{var}\left({y}_{t}\right)=1-\left|{\sum }_{\beta }{w}_{t,\beta }\exp \left(i{y}_{t,\beta }\right)\right|\).

This particle filter has identical initialization, prediction step and weight update at landmark encounters as the basic particle filter and proceeds in exactly the same way until the first landmark encounter. Subsequently, the enhanced particle filter can also use the absence of expected landmark encounters to narrow down its location posterior, similar to the network's ability shown in Extended Data Fig. 5. This is implemented in the following way: if a particle comes within the observation threshold δ of a possible landmark location but no landmark encounter occurs, the particle is deleted by setting its weight to zero; afterwards the particle weights are renormalized. A complication to this implementation is that a subsequent landmark encounter only occurs if the current landmark is different than the previous one (‘landmark encounters'); to prevent the deletion of particles that correctly report a landmark at the current position but do not receive a landmark encounter signal because it is the same landmark as previously encountered, particles are deleted only if they come within the observation threshold δ to a possible landmark that is different than the last landmark and do not encounter it. In case all particles have been deleted, particles are resampled from a uniform distribution and their weights are equalized. As for the basic particle filter, particles are resampled whenever the effective number of particles becomes too small \({N}_{\text{eff}}=1/{\sum }_{\beta }{w}_{t,\beta }^{2} < {N}_{p}/5\). The particle filter estimate \({\hat{y}}_{t}={{\arg }}({\sum }_{\beta }{w}_{t,\beta }\exp (i{y}_{t,\beta }))\) and the circular variance \(\mathrm{var}\left({y}_{t}\right)=1-\left|{\sum }_{\beta }{w}_{t,\beta }\exp \left(i{y}_{t,\beta }\right)\right|\) are also calculated in an identical way.

The timing and accuracy of location disambiguation in Extended Data Fig. 5 was calculated in the following way: we first constructed the trajectory of the ‘alternative location hypothesis,' corresponding to the location estimates of a model animal that made the wrong location disambiguation at the first landmark encounter, but otherwise updated its location by the correct velocity. This trajectory is shifted relative to the true trajectory by a constant distance equal to the distance between the two landmarks. At each point in time, we then identified the two neurons in the output population whose preferred locations were closest to that of the true and alternative trajectory, respectively; the activation of these neurons roughly corresponded to the height of the activation bump corresponding to the true and alternative location hypothesis as seen in Extended Data Fig. 5c,d,h. The disambiguation time was defined as the earliest time after which either the true or alternative location bump height fell below a threshold of 0.1 and stayed beyond that threshold until the end of the trial. To determine the accuracy of location disambiguation the network estimate at the last landmark interaction was analyzed. If this network estimate was closer to the true than to the wrong landmark location the trial was categorized as a correct trial, otherwise it was categorized as an incorrect trial.

We performed PCA on the hidden neuron states from training trials to obtain the top three principal directions. We then projected network states obtained from the distribution of testing trials 2 or 3 (Supplementary Information) onto these principal directions. The resulting reduced-dimension versions of the hidden neuron states from testing trials are shown in Fig. 2 and Extended Data Figs. 5 and 10.

To calculate the correlation dimension for the ANN and RSC activity, we first performed linear dimensionality reduction (PCA) on hidden layer activations from the training trials, retaining 20 principal components. For RSC data, rates were first low-pass filtered at 0.5 Hz. In the 20-dimensional space, we randomly picked 1,000 base points (500 for RSC). From each of these base points, we estimated how the number of neighbors in a ball of radius R scales with R. The minimum ball radius was determined such that the logarithm of the number of neighbors averaged over base points was near 1. The maximum radius was set to ten times the minimum radius, and intermediate values for the radius were spaced equally on a log scale. The slope of the linear part of the relationship between the logarithm of number of neighbors versus ball radius determined the fractal dimension

(a) Schematic of task structure and timing. (b) Example trial schematic showing all possible task states (see Methods for more details). Landmarks were formed by white dots displayed on a screen which served as the floor of the arena. They were only made visible when mice crossed a distance threshold. Only one landmark was visible at a time in the final training stage. Nose-pokes were only registered after mice held their nose in the port for a randomly chosen delay period that was randomized for each visit and not known to the mouse. Incorrect port visits resulted in timeouts that were associated with a bright background across the entire arena. After each complete trial, which results in the reward state, mice are required to complete a separate task in which they need to ‘hunt' for a series of 4 to 8 randomly placed blinking dots on the arena floor. Each dot disappears as soon as the mouse reaches it, resulting either in a new random annulus, or initialization of the next trial. The next trial begins with a new random rotation of the landmarks and rewarded port. (c) Training phases (see Methods). Mice are trained with a single landmark first, then 2 landmarks at unlimited view distance, and finally a limited view distance. (d) Top: Experimental setup for electrophysiology and real-time mouse position tracking. The arena was placed on top of a commercial flat-screen TV that was used to display visual landmarks. A motorized commutator47 was used to reduce tether-induced torque on the mouse, and a real-time optical tracking system was used to regulate the visibility of the landmarks and to identify when the mouse reached any of the blinking dots in the dot-hunting task. Bottom: view of the arena from the top, showing a subset of the reward ports as well as the tracking camera and the motorized commutator. (e) Example excerpt of behavioral data, with state transitions. Landmark visits (black arrowheads) are defined as the point when new landmarks become visible. (f) Top: Training curves for all 4 mice. The three major training phases are indicated with shading (corresponding to panel c). Red: Proportion of time that a landmark is visible (remains 1.0 (100%) until view distance is introduced). Blue: Maximum reward port hold time for each session, the actual hold times are drawn from a uniform distribution. Black: proportion of hits / false positives (corresponds to rewards / timeouts, or proportion correct), for the 1st port visit in each trial. Values over 1/16 indicate that mice can distinguish the correct port amongst all ports. Values over 1 indicate that mice could reliably visit the correct port among the two ports indicated by locally ambiguous landmarks without excluding any other ports by trial and error (see main text and methods). Trials with 1st landmark visit after <20 sec are included in analysis. Grey: Proportion of trials in which mice see both landmarks, and then turn around to go back to the 1st landmark. If this proportion was 0, it would indicate that mice always visit the 2nd port after seeing it, which would on average lead to chance-level behavioral performance. For each individual session, significance of correct choice for the 1st port visit among the two indicated ports was tested with a binomial fit at the 95% level (two-sided, Clopper-Pearson exact method) and is indicated with a star. If the mouse also visited a large proportion of unmarked ports, this fraction can be significant despite the overall correct rate among all 16 ports being small. Bottom: latency to reward after encountering the 2nd landmark in seconds (blue), proportion of visits to ‘a' and ‘b' as fraction of all port visits (orange) and proportion correct choice between ‘a' or ‘b' with binomial 95% CI (binomial as described before, green). See y-axis labels for unit definitions. (g) All paths taken by the mouse in one example session, split by LM0,1,2 state (green, glue, grey). (h) 6 example trials from the same session plotted from the start of the trial to the reward delivery, same color scheme as in g. 2 of the trials include time-outs (red). (i) Retrosplenial cortex is required for integrating egocentric sensory information and hypotheses about the animal's allocentric location, but not for visually guided navigation. To causally test the role of RSC in relating spatial hypotheses to sensory data, we used a parametric allocentric/egocentric task using the same apparatus as in the main experiment and pharmacologically inactivated RSC. Schematic of task structure: Water restricted mice had to visit the port closest to a single visual landmark for a water reward. Visits to any other port resulted in a time-out, but allowed the mice to self-correct. As in the main experiment, the landmark and rewarded port were rotated randomly after each trial, forcing mice to use only the visual landmark. (j) To make the task reliant on allocentric hypotheses, we randomly varied the eccentricity of the landmark (center of the landmark to center of the arena, as fraction of the arena radius) at the beginning of each trial. Trials with low eccentricity (left) required the mouse to find the arena center (though path integration, requiring maintenance of a self-position hypothesis or memory in absence of persistence visual cues indicating the center of the arena) and then extrapolate a straight path through the landmark to the correct rewarded port. Alternatively, mice might triangulate which port is the closest to the landmark from the periphery. These strategies all require integration of self-location hypotheses with visual landmark information. Trials with high eccentricity (right) required merely walking to the port closest to the landmark. This design allowed us to test the role of RSC in the integration of location hypotheses with egocentric visual landmark information while simultaneously determining whether simpler visually-guided navigation was also affected. (k) RSC was either 1) transiently inactivated with Muscimol, 2) sham injected with cortex buffer, or 3) not injected (see methods). Each mouse was tested in both groups, with balanced ordering. (l) Task performance (mean and 95% confidence intervals for hit rate on 1st port visits per trial, via binomial bootstrap). Mice always performed above full chance level (1/16th, assuming they cannot make use of the landmark). Performance was selectively reduced by RSC inactivation for low eccentricity conditions where integration of location hypotheses and visual landmarks was required. Performance in the visually guided condition was only minimally affected.

(a) Location decoders (neural network, cross-validated per trial) do not generalize across landmark states, and LM1 carries less spatial information than LM2. Performance is measured by prediction likelihood in a 10×10 grid, means and shaded 95% CIs across sessions (N = 16 sessions). See Fig. 1f for test via spatial RF differences. (b) Left: Example ANN neuron tuning curves (from LM2) split by travel direction, speed, or location uncertainty (corresponding to LM0,1,2 states, derived from particle filter), showing conjunctive coding. Right: Three RSC example cells showing conjunctive coding of location vs. speed, and direction (Fig. 1d shows task phase vs. location). (c) Left: ANN neurons and, Right: RSC cells (N = 984 neurons) weakly preferentially fire at landmark locations. Top: distribution of locations where RSC cells fire most. Bottom: total average rates, split by LM1 and LM2. (d) Distribution of firing rates by angular position in the arena, same data as panel c. Blue: quantile of firing rates across population. Red: 95% CI of the mean across the population via bootstrap. Despite a small preference for the landmark locations, this effect is small compared to the overall variability on firing rates, and there is no systematic preference for cells to fire in proximity of one vs. the other landmark, even in the LM2 condition. (e) Information gain, which we study by analyzing landmark encounters, as transitions between LM0,1,2 states throughout the manuscript, can also occur when mice fail to encounter a landmark where one would be expected given some hypothesis (see Fig. 2e for an ANN example). These cases can also be decoded from neural activity, but cannot be directly compared to landmark encounters, as they don't offer the matched sensory input (that is no visual input vs. appearance of salient landmark) that we employ in Fig. 4 (mouse encounters 2nd landmark, but it is either ‘a' or ‘b'). These ‘virtual' landmark encounters were decoded with a cross-validated NN on a trial level and compared to real landmark encounters. The same decoder was then cross tested on the reverse condition (grey plot) to show that the neural code for encounters and non-encounters is different, as is expected from the different sensory inputs. Analysis as in Extended Data Fig. 9a, but plots are aligned to the value at the 0-second point, see Methods for details.

(a) Tetrode drive12 implants targeting mouse retrosplenial cortex (RSC). See Methods for details. (b) Example band-passed (100Hz-5kHz) raw voltage traces from 16 tetrodes. (c) Verification of drive implant locations in RSC via histology in all 4 mice. White arrowheads indicate electrolytic lesion sites. (d) Histograms of mean firing rates of all 984 neurons across LM0 (green), LM1 (blue), and LM2 (black) conditions. Neurons are treated as independent samples. Overall rates did not shift significantly across these states. (e) Relative per-neuron changes in firing rates across conditions. Despite the lack of a population-wide shift in average rates, the firing rates of individual cells varied significantly across conditions with heterogeneous patterns of rates. Each grouping shows rates per cell, relative to the rate in LM0 (left) LM1 (middle), and LM2 (right) as individual rates (grey lines and histograms). Bar graphs show the 50% and 95% quantiles. (f) Spatial firing profiles of 42 example neurons split by hypothesis state. Number insets denote Max. firing rate in Hz per condition. For clarity, missing data is that was not due to exclusion via landmark visibility in LM1 is plotted as the darkest color in each plot. (g) Spatial firing rate profiles for all neurons from one example session (52 total), from the main task phase. Profiles were computed in 25×25 bins, and individually normalized to their 99th percentile. (h) same as panel g, but from the separate trial initialization task (‘dot-hunting') in which mice had to hunt for a series of blinking dots that appeared in random positions. (i) 36 example neurons from multiple sessions and animals, chosen to represent the broad range of tuning profiles. For each neuron, the main task tuning and the ‘dot-hunting' are plotted together on the same brightness scale, normalized to their total maximal rate. In the dot-hunting task there is no conserved radial tuning due to the absence of consistent landmarks, however some cells retain angular spatial tuning due to olfactory cues in the arena. Tuning to eccentricity (distance to arena wall or center) is maintained across task phases in many neurons. Small numbers indicate maximum firing rates in Hz for each plot (color scale is same across the pairs).

(a) Foraging and dot-hunting tasks are interleaved, allowing comparisons of how the same neural population represents hypotheses. (b) We predict the number of encountered landmarks either within condition (for example foraging from foraging, each time using one trial as test, fitting to all others), or across. Only the first 2 landmarks were predicted to allow use of the same classifier across both despite the higher number of landmarks in the dot-hunting task. Train and test sets were split by trial. Decoding was done with a regression tree on low-pass filtered firing rates. Performance was quantified as mean error on the N of landmarks. (c) Example dot-hunting trial, the performance from using the foraging predictor is lower. (d) Summary stats from all sessions, means and bootstrapped CIs. The prediction is significantly better when using training data from the same category than when using the neural code from the other; for example dot-hunting to predict the foraging (P= ~0 / ~ 0 within vs. across categories for predicting dot-hunting and foraging landmark state), showing that hypothesis coding is task-specific. (e) To test whether hypothesis encoding is a specific function of task learning or a general feature of RSC, we examined whether coding persisted in case when mice performed the task but were not yet performing well. We first examined the ability to predict correct vs. incorrect port choice (same as in Fig. 4) as a function of per-session task performance. We analyzed data from sessions from the entire training period where the 2 landmarks were used, with at least 5 correct and 5 incorrect choices (N = 42 sessions), due to the closely spaced recordings, neurons might be re-recorded across sessions. On average we analyzed ~15-30 port visits per session (number of trials was unaffected by behavioral performance: CI of slope = [-7.7, 2.7], p = 0.33). Predictions were made as before with a test/train split on balanced hit/miss data with a regression tree. Prediction performance was at chance level ( ~ 47%, P = 0.81 vs. chance) for low performance sessions (total correct choice ratio of 0.8 or lower), and the same as in our initial analysis (Fig. 4) for sessions with high mouse performance ( ~ 66%, P = 0.00096 vs. chance). Overall, prediction performance was significantly correlated with task performance (P = 0.0014 vs. constant model). Individual mice are indicated with colored markers. (f) We also analyzed the more general decoding of landmark encounter count (same as Fig. 1) in all of the 92 sessions with 2 landmarks, and also found a significant correlation (p = 0.0045 vs. constant model), showing that hypothesis encoding throughout the task is driven by task learning. (g) As a control experiment, we tested whether decoding the number of landmarks encountered in the interleaved dot-hunting task might also be affected by task performance, if for instance the neural encoding and performance was a function of general spatial learning, habituation to the arena, motivation, etc., and we found this correlation to be flat (P = .6, CI for slope = [-0.17, 0.29]). We conclude that the encoding of hypothesis state is task-specific and a function of the mouse performing the task.

(a) Structure of the recurrent network. Input neurons encoded noisy velocity input with linear tuning curves (similar to speed cells in the entorhinal cortex60), and landmark information. In the standard setup (referred to as “external map”), the landmark input signaled the global configuration of landmarks (map). If there are K landmarks (all assumed to be perceptually indistinguishable), then whenever the animal encounters a landmark, the input provides a simultaneous encoding of all K landmark locations using spatially tuned input cells. Thus, the input encodes the map of the environment but does not disambiguate locations within it. This input can be thought of as originating from a distinct brain area that identifies the current environment and provides the network with its map. (b) Trajectories varied randomly and continuously in speed and direction. There were 2-4 landmarks at random locations. (c) Activity of output neurons ordered by preferred location as a function of time in an easy trial with two nearby landmarks and a constant velocity trajectory. Black arrows: landmark encounters. Thick black dashed line: time of disambiguation of location estimate in output layer. Thin red dashed line: true location. The network's decision on when to collapse its estimate is flexible, and dynamically adapts the decision time to task difficulty: When the task is harder because of the configuration of landmarks (the task becomes harder as the two landmarks approach a 180 degree separation because of velocity noise and the resulting imprecision in estimating distances; the task is impossible at 180 degree because of symmetry), the network keeps alive multiple hypotheses about its states across more landmark encounters until it is able to reach an accurate decision. Panels c,d,f,g show example trials from experiment configuration 4 (See Methods) with different values of landmark separation parametrized by α. (d) Same as c, but in a difficult trial with two landmarks almost opposite of each other. (e) Top: The ANN took longer to disambiguate its location in harder task configurations: average time until disambiguation as a function of landmark separation (Standard error bars are narrower than line width). Middle: Distribution of the number of landmark encounters until the network disambiguates location, as a function of landmark separation. Bottom: Fraction of trials in which the network location estimate is closer to the correct than the alternative landmark location at the last landmark encounter, as a function of landmark separation. Data from 10000 trials in experiment configuration 4, 1000 for each of the 10 equally spaced values of α. The performance of the ANN (Fig. 2 main text) can be compared to the much poorer performance achieved by a strategy of path integration to update a single location estimate with landmark-based resets (to the coordinates of the landmark that is nearest the current path-integrated estimate), Fig. 2b (black versus gray). The latter strategy is equivalent to existing continuous attractor integration models13,14 combined with a landmark- or border based resetting mechanism16,56,57,61, which to our knowledge is as far as models of brain localization circuits have gone in combining internal velocity-based estimates with external spatial cues. The present network goes beyond a simple resetting strategy, matching the performance of a sequential probabilistic estimator – the particle filter (PF) – which updates samples from a multi-peaked probability distribution over possible locations over time and is asymptotically Bayes-optimal (M = 1000 particles versus N = 128 neurons in network; Fig. 2b, lavender (PF) and green (enhanced PF)). Notably, the network matches PF performance without using stochastic or sampling-based representations, which have been proposed as possible neural mechanisms for probabilistic computation39,62. (f) Similar to c, but in a trial where the network disambiguates its location before the second landmark encounter. Yellow arrows mark times of landmark interactions if the alternative location hypothesis had been correct. Disambiguation occurs shortly after the absence of a landmark encounter at the first yellow arrow. (g) Similar to f, but in a trial where disambiguation occurs at the first landmark location, since no landmark has been encountered at the time denoted by the first gray arrow. (h) In the regular task where landmark identity must be inferred by the ANN, discrete hypothesis states (denoted LM0,1,2 throughout) emerge during the LM1 state. (j) If the ANN is instead given the landmark identity via separate input channels, it immediately identifies the correct location after the 1st landmark encounter and learns to acts as a simple path integration attractor without hypothesis states. Plots show ANN output as in c,d,g,f. (i,k) To quantify the separation of hypothesis states in the ANNs hidden states even in cases where such separation might not be evident in a PCA projection, we linearly projected hidden state activations onto the axis that separates the hypothesis states. The regular ANN shows a clear LM1 vs LM2 separation, but the ANN trained with landmark identity does not distinguish between these. (l) Population statistics for ANN with external map input. Scatter plot of enhanced particle filter (ePF) circular variance vs. estimate decoded from hidden layer of the network. 4000 trials from experiment configuration 1 were used to train a linear decoder on the posterior circular variance of the ePF from the activity of the hidden units and performance was evaluated on 1000 test trials. (m) Scatter plot of widths and heights of ANN tuning curves after the 2nd landmark encounter. Insets: example tuning curves corresponding to red dots. Unlike hand-designed continuous attractor networks, where neurons typically display homogeneous tuning across cells13,63,64, our model reproduces the heterogeneity observed in hippocampus and associated cortical areas. Tuning curves are from LM2 using 1000 trials from experiment configuration 2 using 20 location bins. Tuning height specifies the difference between the tuning curve maximum and minimum, and tuning width denotes the fraction of the tuning curve above the mean of maximum and minimum. (n) The distribution of recurrent weights shows that groups of neurons with strong or weak location tuning or selectivity have similar patterns and strengths of connectivity within and between groups: distribution of absolute connection strength between and across location-sensitive “place cells” (PCs) and location-insensitive “unselective cells” (UCs) in the ANN. The black line denotes the mean; s.e.m. is smaller than the linewidth. The result is consistent with data suggesting that place cells and non-place cells do not form distinct sub-networks, but are part of a system that collectively encodes more than just place information65. Location tuning curves were determined after the second landmark encounter using 5000 trials from distribution 1 and using 20 location bins. The resulting tuning curves were shifted to have minimum value 0 and normalized to sum to one. The location entropy of each neuron was defined to be the entropy of the normalized location tuning curve. Neurons were split in two equal sets according to their location entropy, where neurons with low entropy were defined as “place cells” (PCs) and neurons with high entropy were defined as “non-place cells” (UCs). Between and across PCs and UCs absolute connection strength was calculated as the absolute value of the recurrent weight between non-identical pairs. (o) Pairwise correlation structure30 is maintained across LM[1,2] states and environments. Corresponds to Fig. 3a. Top: Correlations in spatial tuning between pairs of cells in one environment after the 1st landmark encounter / LM1 (left), after the 2nd encounter / LM2, and in a separate environment in LM2 (right). The neurons are ordered according to their preferred locations in environment 1. Bottom: Example tuning curve pairs (normalized amplitude) corresponding to the indicated locations i-iv. Data from experiment configuration 1. (p) State-space activity of ANN is approximately 3-dimensional. Even when summed across all environments and random trajectories, the states still occupy a very low-dimensional subspace of the full state space, quantified by the correlation dimension as d ≈ 3 (left, see Methods). This measure typically overestimates manifold dimension66, and serves as an upper bound on the true manifold dimension. As a control, the method yields a much larger dimension (d = 14) on the same network architecture with large random recurrent weights (right); thus, the low-dimensional dynamics are an emergent property of the network when it is trained on the navigation task. Data from 5000 trial, recurrent weights were sampled i.i.d. from a uniform distribution Wh,ij ~ U([ − 1, 1]), then fixed across trials. The initial hidden state across trials was sampled from ht=0,i ~ U([ − 1, 1]). Data from 5000 trials from experiment configuration 1. (q) In the LM2 state, position on the rate-space attractor corresponds to location in the maze. State-space trajectories after second landmark encounter for random trajectories. Color corresponds to true location (plot shows 100 trials). (r) ANN with external map input implements a circular attractor structure: Hidden layer activity arranged by preferred location in an example trial shows a bump of activity that moves coherently. Black arrows: first two landmark encounters. Preferred location was determined after the second landmark encounter using 5000 trials from experiment configuration 1. (s) Left: Recurrent weight matrix arranged by preferred location of neurons (determined after the second landmark encounter using 5000 trials from experiment configuration 1) indicates no apparent ring structure, despite apparent bump of activity that moves with velocity inputs (panel a). Right: However, recurrent coupling of modes defined by output weights (defined by \({W}_{{out}}{W}_{{rec}}{W}_{{out}}^{T}\), where \({W}_{{rec}}\) are the recurrent weights and \({W}_{{out}}\) are the output weights) has a clear band structure. Connections between appropriate neural mixtures in the hidden layer – defined by the output projection of the neurons – therefore exhibit a circulant structure, but the actual recurrent weights do not, even after sorting neurons according to their preferred locations. The ANN thus implements a generalization of hand-wired attractor networks, in which the integration of velocity inputs by the recurrent weights occurs in a basis shuffled by an arbitrary linear transformation. Given these results, one cannot expect a connectomic reconstruction of a recurrent circuit to display an ordered matrix structure even when the dynamics are low-dimensional, without considering the output projection. Because trials in the mouse experiments typically ended almost immediately when the mouse had seen both landmarks (See Extended Data Fig. 1f for a quantification), we did not quantify the topology of the neural dynamics in RSC. (t) Low-dimensional state-space dynamics in the ANN with external map input suggests novel form of probabilistic encoding. Visualization of the full state-space dynamics of the hidden layer population, projected onto the three largest principal components, for constant-velocity trajectories. ANN hidden layer activity was low-dimensional: Fig. 3a shows data on low-dimensional dynamics, evident in maintained pairwise correlations, and Fig. 3d and panel p show correlation dimension. Trajectories are shown from the beginning of the trials; arrows indicate landmark encounter locations, black squares: first landmark encounter; black circles: second landmark encounter; line colors denote trajectory stage: LM0 (green), LM1 (blue), andLM2 (grey). Data in a-c is from 1000 trials from experiment configuration 3 (see Methods); sensory noise was set to zero. Trajectory starting points were selected to be a fixed distance before the first landmark. The intermediate ring (LM1) corresponds to times at which the output neurons represent multiple hypotheses, whereas the final location-coding ring (LM2), well-separated from the multiple hypothesis coding ring, corresponds to the period during which the output estimate has collapsed to a single hypothesis. In other words, the network internally encodes single-location hypothesis states separably from multi-location hypothesis states, as we find in RSC (Fig. 1), and transitions smoothly between them, a novel form of encoding of probability distributions that appears distinct from previously suggested forms of probabilistic representation39,62. (u) ANN trial trajectory examples, (corresponding to Fig. 2e). Divergence of trajectories for two paths that are idiothetically identical until after the second landmark encounter. ‘a' and ‘b' denote identities of locally ambiguous identical landmarks. Disambiguation occurs at the second landmark encounter, or by encountering locations where a landmark would be expected in the opposite identity assignments. See insets for geometry of trajectories and landmark locations. LM2 state has been simplified in these plots. (v) All four trajectories from panel b plotted simultaneously, and with full corresponding LM2 state. (w) The low-dimensional state-space manifold is stable, attracting perturbed states back to it, which suggests that the network dynamics follow a low-dimensional continuous attractor and the network's computations are robust to most types of noise. Relaxations in state space after perturbations before the first (left), between first and second (middle), and after the second (right) landmark encounter. For the base trial, a trial with two landmarks and random trajectory was chosen. The first and second landmark encounter in this base trial is at time t = 2 s and t = 4.6 s respectively. At time t = 1 s (left), t = 4 s (middle), and t = 7 s (right) a multiplicative perturbation of size 50% was introduced at the hidden layer. See Extended Data Fig. 10l for same result on internal map ANNs.

(a) Top: Tuning curves (mean rate) for displacement from last encountered landmark for LM1 and LM2 states in ANN. Bottom: Same data, but distribution of firing rates. The network discovers that displacement from the last landmark encounter in the LM1 period is a key latent variable, and its encoding is an emergent property. Intriguingly, a similar displacement-to-location coding switch has been observed in mouse CA167, suggesting that the empirically observed switch may be related to the brain performing spatial reasoning to disambiguate between multiple location hypotheses. (b) Same as panel a but for global location, ANN neurons became more tuned to global location rather than landmark-relative information after encountering the 2nd landmark. (c) Decoding of location, displacement, and separation between landmarks from the ANN in a 2-landmark environment by a linear decoder that remains fixed across trials and environments. Top: Squared population decoding error of location (green) and displacement (blue), as a function of the number of encountered landmarks. As suggested by the well-tuned activity of ANN neurons, location can be linearly decoded in the LM2 state. Displacement can be best decoded in the LM1 state. Bottom: Square decoding error of distance between landmarks, as a function of the number of encountered landmarks. The representation is particularly accurate around the time just before and after the first landmark encounter, when location disambiguation takes place. Top: Performance was evaluated on 1000 trials from experiment configuration 2. For location, the decoder corresponded to the network location estimate. For displacement, the linear decoder was trained on 4000 separate trials. Bottom: experiment configuration 1 with 4000 trials to train the linear decoder and 1000 trials to evaluate it. Thus, the network's encoding of these three critical variables is dynamic and tied to the different computational imperatives at each stage: displacement and landmark separation are not explicit inputs but the network estimates these and represents them in a decodable way at LM1, the critical time when this information is essential to the computation. After LM2, the network decodability of landmark separation drops, as it is no longer essential. (d) Neurons in RSC also became less well tuned to relative displacements from landmarks in LM2 relative to LM1: histogram across all RSC neurons of entropy of tuning curve for angular displacement from last seen landmark in RSC. Black: for LM2 state, Blue: for LM1 state. Red: histogram of pairwise differences. For this analysis, angular firing rate distributions were analyzed relative to either the global reference frame or the last seen landmark. (e) Same as d, but for global location. (f) The absolute change in landmark-relative displacement coding (d) is larger than that of the allocentric location tuning (e), suggesting that the latter is less affected by task state.

(a) Bottom: Mean spatial activity profile of 2 example ANN neurons for LM1 and LM2. Average tuning is higher for the LM2 state. Top: same data as histograms, showing that the less well-tuned LM1 state corresponds to a bimodal rate distribution (rates are high in some trials, low in others) that transitions to a unimodal distribution once the 2nd landmark has been identified in LM2. Data are from experiment configuration 2 (See Methods, section ‘Overview over experiment configurations used with ANNs'). Tuning curves were calculated using 20 bins of location/displacements and normalized individually for each neuron. The first time step in each trial and time steps with non-zero landmark input were excluded from the analysis. For histograms, each condition was binned in 100 column bins and neuron rates in 10 row bins. Histograms were normalized to equal sum per column. (b) Similarly, RSC rates are more dispersed per location in LM1. Schematic of analysis: firing rates were low pass filtered at 0.5 Hz, and for each location, the distribution of rates was computed in 8 bins, between the lowest and highest rate of that cell. (c) Example analysis for one cell. Top: Rate distribution resolved by 2D-location (4×4 bins) for example RSC neuron. Bottom: the resulting 16 histograms for LM1 and LM2 each, red dotted example histograms correspond to indicated example location (red dotted circles). (d) Summary statistics showing a more dispersed rate distribution per location in LM1. In sum, this analysis shows that in addition to the explicit encoding of uncertainty by a stable rate code (conjunctive with position and other variables), as shown in Fig. 1d,e,f and Extended Data Fig. 2a, where one would not expect a higher degree of trial-to-trial variability with higher uncertainty, there is still a degree of increased variability in states where the mouse might ‘take a guess' that would differ between trials. This parallels a similar behavior in the ANN (panel a).

(a) Low-dimensional population structure can be probed by pairwise neural relationships30: correlations or offsets in spatial tuning between cell pairs should be preserved across environments if the dynamics across environments is low-dimensional. Example spike rates (6 sec window, low-passed at 1 Hz using a single-pole Butterworth filter) for 3 RSC neuron pairs from one example session. R values for each pair were computed across the LM1 and LM2 condition, as well as in the task-initialization phase where mice had to hunt blinking dots (Extended Data Figs. 1, 4). The latter provides a control condition where no landmark-based navigation was required and mice instead had to walk to randomly appearing targets. (b) Top: pairwise correlation matrices for LM1,2 and dot-hunting conditions. Example pairs are highlighted (i,ii,iii). Bottom: spatial firing rate profiles for example pairs. Same analysis as in Fig. 3a. (c) RSC activity is globally low-dimensional. Proportion of variance of low-pass filtered (0.5 Hz) firing rates explained by first 45 principal components from the LM1 states. Proportion of variance explained (black, 16 sessions) drops to below that of shuffled spike trains (red) after the 6-10th principal component. The inset shows the analysis split by condition (same as in panels a and b), and 95% Cis for the spectra across sessions. The right panel shows zoomed in region of the same plot. We found no relationship between individual PCA components and task variables. (d) Correlation dimension in RSC is also low (same analysis as for the ANN in Extended Data Fig. 5p). This measure typically overestimates manifold dimension66, and thus serves as an upper bound on the true manifold dimension. (e) Grey/black: Summary statistics (median and quartiles) for correlation of correlations (panel b shows one example session, black dots indicate individual sessions, N = 16). Median of R value of R values for LM1 vs. LM2 = 0.74 (corresponding R in ANN = 0.73), for LM1 vs. dot-hunting = 0.51. Green: same analysis but spike rates were computed with a 5 Hz low-pass instead of the 1 Hz used throughout, no systematic changes were observed as function of low-pass settings. (f) Rates of individual RSC neurons can be predicted from other neurons with linear regression. In the LM2 to LM2 condition (black), the linear fit is computed for one held-out neuron's rate from other concurrent rates, and the same regression weights are then used to predict rates during LM1 (green) and dot-hunting (red) time periods. True rates of predicted neurons are plotted as solid black lines. (g) Summary statistics for the linear regression. Histograms show the proportion of explained variance for all 984 neurons, split by condition. In the LM2 to LM2 condition, the fit is computed from other concurrent rates (40.5% variance explained, median across neurons). In the two other conditions, the regression weights are fit in LM2 and held fixed. The sequential, non-interleaved nature of this train/test split across task phases means that any consistent firing rate drifts across the conditions will lead to poor predictions, and consequently, a small number of neurons exhibit negative R2 values indicating a fit that can, for some cells, be worse than an average rate model (11.3% for LM1, 19.3% median across neurons for dot-hunting, small grey bars). However, 24.3% of variance (median across neurons) can be explained despite significant changes in spatial receptive fields (predict LM1 with LM2 weights) and even for a different task, with 16.2% when predicting dot-hunting activity from LM2 weights (red and green histogram and bars showing 95% CI of median). (h) Pairwise correlations between RSC neurons in another example session, same analysis as in panel b, and associated scatterplots. (i) Low-dimensional activity quantified via participation ratio (PR)68. This analysis does not account for noisy eigenvalue estimates from spiketrains, and consequently the shuffled spike trains where there are no prominent modes that correspond to stable sensory, motor, or latent states, yield values of PR = ~ 45.

(a) Top left: the speed at which the neural activity evolves (avg. speed of largest 5 principal components, filtered at 1 Hz, CIs via bootstrap) correlates with running speed. Top right: When landmarks appear/disappear, they perturb neural activity (effect of mouse speed is regressed out). Bottom: Analysis of the time course of the prediction of LM0,1,2 state from RSC firing rates around the time when the landmarks appeared. Plots show 95% CIs for the mean of the state prediction, aligned to the mean, corresponding to a de-biased state estimation probability over time. Decoding was performed using the same method as in Fig. 1. (b) For some analyses of the low-dimensional dynamics in RSC (Fig. 4, this figure panel h), rate fluctuations related to non-spatial covariates such as speed, heading, etc. were removed: a single-layer LSTM with 20 hidden units was trained to predict the mouse position in a 10×10 grid from the RSC rates. The network learned 20 spatially relevant mixtures of input firing rates, with appropriate temporal smoothing to represent the mouse location. These activations were then embedded into 3-D space via isomap53. (c) To find trials across which mouse trajectories as they approached the 2nd landmark were similar, mouse trajectories were clustered (see Methods) leading to a subset of trials with similar locomotion and visual inputs. (d) The activity of RSC, in the low-dimensional representation, and in raw spike counts was then analyzed further. The example plot shows low-dimensional neural trajectories from LM0,1,2 states during matched mouse trajectories. (e) Alternative hypotheses for smoothness / predictability of neural dynamics across trials (corresponding to Fig. 4c). Dynamics across trials could behave like a laminar flow, so that trials with similar neural state remain so (top), or they could shuffle, leading to a loss of the pairwise distance relationships across trials (bottom). (f) We measured this maintenance vs. loss of correlation in a sliding 750 ms window beginning at the 2nd landmark onset, versus a window just before. CIs were computed across sessions (See Methods). (g) Hypotheses for whether stable neural dynamics (Fig. 3b,c, Extended Data Fig. 8) can determine how RSC activity encodes disambiguated landmark identity (‘a' or ‘b'). Top: trials in which the correct identity is ‘a' but that are neurally close to other trials where the answer is ‘b' might get dragged along in the wrong direction at least transiently. This would indicate relevance of recurrent dynamics on this computation. Bottom: alternatively, neural activity could be determined by the correct answer, even in trials that (in neural rate space) are close to trials from the opposing class. (h) We tested this by finding the closest trial from the opposing class (for example the closest LM1a for a LM1b trial) in the 3-D embedded (via Isomap) RSC rate space. To evaluate co-evolution regardless of this selection confound, we then analyzed the direction of flow of the neural state over time (red). As a control, we also analyzed neurally far trials (grey). The flow direction of the neural activity was significantly aligned for ~100 ms. Median and CI via bootstrap. (i) Left: Schematic for the analysis of representation of LM1a vs. LM1b states. Trial-to-trial distances were compared within group vs. across group. Right: Both before and after the 2nd landmark becomes visible, the classes are distinct in neural state space. (Same data as in Fig. 4b, 5 sessions, 101 matched trials). (j) Whether a trial comes from LM1a or b can also be decoded from low-pass filtered (2 Hz) firing rates before the 2nd landmark onset (via regression tree, cross-validated across trials, balanced N across conditions, 5 sessions).

(a) ANN with binary landmark presence input. Here, the ANN must simultaneously infer the landmark locations and the location of the animal, in contrast to the previous “external map” configuration. These determinations are inter-related, thus the much higher difficulty of the task. Structure of the recurrent network. Input neurons encoded noisy velocity (10 neurons) and landmark information (1 neuron). In the internal map setup, the input signaled whether a landmark was present at the current position or not. (b) State space trajectories in the internal map network after the second landmark encounter in two different environments. The dark green / dark blue parts of the trajectories correspond to the sections before the third landmark encounter. Left: Predominantly counterclockwise trajectories, right: Predominantly clockwise trajectories. Landmarks and trajectories were sampled with the same parameters as experiment configuration 1, but the duration of test trials was extended from 10 s (100 timesteps) to 50 s (500 timesteps). Only trials with low error after the second landmark encounter are shown, defined as maximum network localization error smaller than 0.5 rad, measured in a time window between 5 timesteps after the second landmark encounter until the end of the trial. Only the state-space trajectory after the second landmark encounter is displayed. (c) State space dimension is approximately 3, same analysis as in Extended Data Fig. 5p. (d) Example tuning curves, same analysis as in Extended Data Fig. 5m. (e) Linear decoding of position, displacement from last landmark and landmark separation from ANN activity, same analysis as in Extended Data Fig. 6c. A multinomial regression decoder was trained on 4000 trials from experiment configuration 1 (the training distribution of the internal map task) to predict from hidden layer activities which of the four possible environments was present. Performance was evaluated on separate 1000 test trials sampled from the training distribution. (f) Example neurons showing transition from egocentric landmark-relative displacement coding to allocentric location encoding, same analysis as in Extended Data Fig. 6a,b. (g) Example neurons showing conjunctive encoding, same analysis as in Extended Data Fig. 2b. Location tuning curves were determined after the second landmark encounter using 1000 trials from experiment configuration 2 using 20 location bins. Velocity and uncertainty from the posterior circular variance of the enhanced particle filter were binned in three equal bins. (h) Distribution of absolute connection strength between and across location-sensitive “place cells” (PCs) and location-insensitive “unselective cells” (UCs), same analysis as in Extended Data Fig. 5n. (i) Hidden unit activations, corresponding to Fig. 2d. (j) Trajectories from example trials, as in Fig. 2e. (k) Same trajectories as in i&j but with full LM2 state. (l) ANN is robust to perturbations, same as in Extended Data Fig. 5w. (m) ANN maintains pairwise correlation structure across states and environments, same as in Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 5o. (n) ANN with non-negative rates recapitulates the main findings from the conventional ANNs. Training an ANN in the external map condition but with non-negative activity replicated all key results from the other NN types: we observed similar results with respect to location and displacement tuning (r), the transition in linear decodability of displacement to location from the population and dynamically varying decodability of landmark separations within trials (p), the presence of heterogeneous and conjunctive tuning (s), lack of modularity in connectivity between cells with high and low amounts of spatial selectivity (t), and the preservation of cell-to-cell correlations across time within trials and across environments (q). The nonlinearity does affect the distribution of recurrent weights: The distribution of non-diagonal elements in the non-negative network is sparse (excess kurtosis k = 7.8), while it is close to Gaussian for the external and internal map networks with tanh-nonlinearity (k = 0.6 and k = 0.9 respectively; panel u); however, the distributions of eigenvalues of the recurrent weights have similar characteristics for all trained networks (panel v). Structure of the recurrent network: Input neurons encoded noisy velocity (10 neurons) and received external map input (70 neuron), same as the regular external map ANN. Recurrent layer rates were constrained to be non-negative. (o) Example tuning curves, same analysis as before. (p)Linear decoding of position, displacement from last landmark and landmark separation from ANN activity, same analysis as before. (q) ANN maintains pairwise correlation structure across states and environments, same as before. (r) Example neurons showing transition from egocentric landmark-relative displacement coding to allocentric location encoding, same analysis as before. (s) Example neurons showing conjunctive encoding, same analysis before. (t) Distribution of absolute connection strength between and across location-sensitive “place cells” (PCs) and location-insensitive “unselective cells” (UCs), same analysis as before. (u) Distribution of non-diagonal recurrent weights for randomly initialized (untrained), external map, internal map, and non-negative network. The k-value measured denotes excess kurtosis, a measure of deviation from Gaussianity (k = 0 for Gaussian distributions). The presence of a nonlinearity constraint on the ANN affects the distribution of recurrent weights: The distribution of non-diagonal elements in the non-negative network is sparse (excess kurtosis k = 7.8), while it is close to Gaussian for the external and internal map networks with tanh-nonlinearity (k = 0.6 and k = 0.9 respectively). (v) Scatterplot of real and imaginary part of complex eigenvalues of recurrent weight matrix for randomly initialized (untrained), external map, internal map, and non-negative network. The distributions of eigenvalues of the recurrent weights have similar characteristics for all trained networks.

Metrics details

Quality control (QC) is a crucial step to ensure the reliability of data obtained from RNA sequencing experiments, including spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT). Existing QC approaches for SRT that have been adopted from single-cell or single-nucleus RNA sequencing methods are confounded by spatial biology and are inappropriate for SRT data. In addition, no methods currently exist for identifying histological tissue artifacts that are unique to SRT. Here, we introduce SpotSweeper, a spatially aware QC method that leverages local neighborhoods to correct for spatial confounding in order to identify both local outliers and regional artifacts in SRT. Using SpotSweeper on publicly available data, we identify a consistent set of Visium barcoded spots as systematically low quality and demonstrate that SpotSweeper accurately identifies two distinct types of regional artifacts. SpotSweeper represents a substantial advancement in spatially resolved transcriptomics QC for SRT, providing a robust, generalizable framework to ensure data reliability across diverse experimental conditions and technologies.

Elon Musk's business empire, including SpaceX, Starlink, and Tesla collectively stands to lose at least $48 billion in sales over roughly the next decade if President Donald Trump acts on his veiled threat to cancel the companies' contracts with the US government, according to a WIRED review of publicly available data. Amid growing criticism from Musk on Thursday about the federal budget, Trump said that “the easiest way to save money” would be “to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.”

The federal government typically retains sweeping authority to terminate contracts “for convenience,” a catchall term that can include budget constraints or shifting priorities. But in practice, severing ties with Musk's companies would be far from simple, carrying serious consequences for the US across areas like defense, space, and transportation.

Musk and Trump have been publicly sparring over a spending bill moving through Congress and supported by the president. The legislation, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, advances Trump priorities such as cutting taxes and bolstering funding for border security, but it would also add $3 trillion to the national debt, according to an official estimate.

Musk has warned that the government's ballooning debt will push the country into “de facto bankruptcy.” In total, the government's outstanding contracts with SpaceX and Tesla amount to about 2 percent of the projected deficit from the new spending bill.

Many observers predicted that Musk's financial support for Trump's reelection campaign and his role as an advisor to the White House would be a boon for ventures such as SpaceX, which has long done work for the US government. But now, the deteriorating relationship has become a significant business liability.

Opportunities may disappear for Space's Starlink internet service to do work overseas, Tesla to provide armored vehicles to the State Department, and Musk-founded Boring Company to potentially help drill an Amtrak train tunnel. Tesla shares fell over 14 percent on Thursday, wiping out $152 billion from the company's market cap, though the stock has since partially recovered.

If Trump seeks further retribution for Musk's attacks, federal government investigations and potential litigation into his companies could cost the billionaire at least $2.37 billion in purported penalties, congressional estimates from January show.

Musk and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.

Most of Musk's work for the government is through his private space technology company SpaceX, which launches rockets and also sells satellite-based internet. Beside NASA, the US military heavily depends on SpaceX to help launch satellites into orbit for secure communications, spying on enemies, and GPS functioning.

In the coming years, SpaceX is slated to directly collect about $34 billion from NASA and the US military for rocket-related projects. The estimate includes the maximum amount of unpaid but contracted funds, according to summaries the US government posts online.

The data show the US is also on the hook for about $14 billion for SpaceX's Starlink internet service at numerous offices, such as a Department of Interior facility in Nevada.

The data could be outdated or include errors, but many of the listed figures line up with press releases from agencies such as the US Space Force. Some of the funding is subject to Congressional approval, and a portion could end up going to SpaceX's rivals.

But SpaceX's competitors have faced numerous technical setbacks, and Musk's company remains the dominant market leader. The billionaire said this week that SpaceX would earn about $15.5 billion in revenue this year, nearly double estimates from two years ago. SpaceX has accounted for 134 of the 166 orbital launches in the US so far this year, according to tracking by Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian.

WIRED didn't review detailed contracts or search for deals the government may have struck with Musk's companies through intermediaries. For instance, some government agencies may be buying ads on Musk's X social media platform through advertising agencies.

The government's vehicle fleet includes Tesla electric vehicles, according to documents online, and the General Services Administration recently paid the company for maintenance.

But the GSA's annual Federal Fleet Report doesn't break down the number of vehicles by manufacturer or offer details on future spending. The report lists 7,706 battery electric vehicles in the government fleet. Earlier this year, the Trump administration paused orders of new zero-emissions vehicles, dealing a blow to companies such as Tesla.

Musk's companies have benefitted from government support for years. In February, an analysis by the Washington Post found Musk businesses had received at least $38 billion since 2003 in government contracts, loans, subsidies and tax credits across the US, including at the state and local levels. A New York Times analysis from October identified at least $15.4 billion in federal government contracts over the past decade for Tesla and SpaceX.

But Musk himself has tried to take a chainsaw to federal spending through his work leading the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency which claims to have saved $180 billion since January, including by canceling contracts, though that figure remains highly disputed.

Some of DOGE's efforts were temporarily blocked by the federal courts and also drew protests from federal labor unions, public activists, Congress, states, and even Trump's own aides and cabinet secretaries. Last month, Musk said he was stepping away from DOGE work to focus on his companies.

Trump's cost-cutting initiatives haven't stopped, though. Hiring freezes remain in effect, and the importance of stretching each dollar further is being emphasized more than ever at many federal agencies, according to representatives at two companies with major government contracts. They declined to be named out of fear of retribution from Trump.

Of all the words in the dictionary, Sarah Franklin says “balance” is perhaps her favorite — especially when it comes to companies embracing AI.

Franklin leads the Jack Altman-founded employee performance software company Lattice, which is now worth $3 billion. Both onstage at SXSW London and in conversation with TechCrunch, she spoke a lot about balance — the opportunities in finding it, and the risks of not having it during this AI revolution. 

“We put people first,” Franklin told TechCrunch, referring to Lattice, which has started to adopt more AI and automation features. 

Although some companies are touting AI as a way to replace massive numbers of workers, some tech leaders are speaking more openly about the importance of striking a balance at their companies: retaining human employees while augmenting them with AI assistants and “agents.” At SXSW London, Franklin said that looking to fully replace human workers might seem like a good idea in the short term for cost-saving reasons, but such a move might not actually be attractive to customers.

“It's important to ask yourself, ‘Are you building for the success of the AI first [or are] you building for the success of the people and your customers first?” she said, adding that trust is the most important currency any founder or startup company has, and that building trust with consumers is paramount. “It's good to have efficiency, but you don't want to trade out trust.” 

Franklin also stressed the importance of transparency, accountability, and responsibility when it comes to AI. Leaders need to be transparent with employees about what the AI is doing, the AI must be narrowly applied to a particular goal so people understand how it works, and humans must ultimately be held accountable for what the AI impacts. 

“Otherwise, we are then in service of the AI versus the AI being in service of us,” Franklin continued. 

In an interview with TechCrunch after her SXSW appearance, Franklin said Lattice has built an AI HR agent that gives proactive insights and assists employees in one-on-one meetings. The company also has a platform where Lattice clients can create their own custom agents for their businesses. 

Franklin was adamant that humans must have oversight of any AI technology implemented by a company. “It's a way to just have the regular checks and balances that we're used to in our workforce,” she told TechCrunch.

She thinks the victors in this AI moment in history will be the ones who learn how to put people first. According to Franklin, it's one of the most important guardrails that a company can have on AI. 

“We all have a responsibility to make sure that we're doing this for the people of society,” Franklin said. “Human connection cannot be replaced, and the winners are going to be the companies that understand that.”

Update 6/6/2025 9:00 am ET: Jon Peddie has kindly provided us with comments regarding AMD's GPU business underperformance in Q1 2025. He believes that the sources of AMD's decline in GPU shipments lie in the company's failure to accurately predict demand for its GPU products six to nine months in advance, as well as the necessity to balance its TSMC allocations between Zen CPUs and Radeon GPUs. Read the exact comments below.

AMD's desktop GPU market share, based on sales into the market, has dropped to a historic low in the latest report from Jon Peddie Research, despite the company's launch of new products during the quarter. Discrete GPU shipments for desktop PCs increased significantly both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in Q1 2025 and totaled 9.2 million units. However, as both AMD and Nvidia rolled out their new-generation graphics cards in the first quarter, Nvidia managed to sell millions of its new GeForce RTX 50-series GPUs and capture its highest market share, while AMD struggled to sell even 750,000 add-in-boards, which is why its share dropped to a historical low.



Nvidia now commands around 92% of the desktop discrete GPU market, while AMD's share declined to approximately 8%, the company's lowest share ever.

The industry shipped 9.2 million standalone graphics processing units for desktop PCs during the first quarter, up 8.5% compared to the prior quarter and by 5.3% on an annual basis. In terms of market share dynamics, Nvidia was the only major vendor to expand its position, gaining 8.5%. AMD's share declined by 7.3%, while Intel's share saw a smaller contraction of 1.2%. 



AMD's GPU shipments totaled approximately 740,000 to 750,000 units, the company's worst results in three years. To make matters worse, for the first time in decades (if not ever), the quarterly sales of AMD GPUs declined despite the launch of new halo products. Jon Peddie, the head of Jon Peddie Research, believes the poor performance was a result of an AMD demand misprediction in Q1.

Nvidia sold around 8.46 million standalone graphics processors for desktops, the company's best result in three years, especially keeping in mind that the company sold quite expensive products ($379 - $1999) during the first quarter and these products happen to be some of the best graphics cards around. 



"AMD and Nvidia have to walk a tight rope wire when it comes to placing orders at fabs like TMSC — and you never get it right all the time," said Jon Peddie, president of Jon Peddie Research, in a conversation with Tom's Hardware. "Forecasting demand six to nine months in advance, when the economic and political environment is so unstable adds an additional layer of complexity. Then you have yield issues on top of it all, and of course you have to get the specs right. Nonetheless, AMD has been doing this for decades and knows all those tradeoffs, plus in their case they have the added burden of balancing resources of demand for Zen CPUs against GPUs."

The numbers from Jon Peddie Research appear to contradict comments made by Lisa Su, Chief Executive of AMD, who stated during the quarter that the launch of the company's Radeon RX 9070-series products was AMD's most successful product launch in terms of first-week sales. Yet, this is not exactly the case. Jon Peddie Research monitors how many GPU chips each company sells-in to its partners per quarter, not the number of cards sold through retailers. By contrast, Lisa Su mentioned sold through results of the Radeon RX 9070-series, referring to the final stage where the retailer sells the product to the end user.

Images of AMD's early Navi 48 graphics processors — the GPUs that power the Radeon RX 9070-series boards — indicate that their assembly took place in late October 2024, which means that production of the actual silicon started approximately 90 days prior, in late July 2024. This suggests that AMD had been building up inventory for several months ahead of the official launch on March 6, 2025. 

While the total number of GPUs and add-in boards accumulated before the release remains unclear, Jon Peddie Research reported back in March that AMD delivered around 1.43 million discrete desktop GPUs to partners in the fourth quarter of 2024. The lion's share of these processors were likely AMD's Navi 48, so it is reasonable to conclude that AMD entered the first quarter of 2025 with a substantial stockpile of Navi 48 chips. Although precise figures are not available, it is likely that AMD's partners shipped well over a million Radeon RX 9070-series graphics cards during the quarter. However, this was a result of accumulating GPUs over a period of about six months.

By contrast, the company AMD supplied its partners with only around 740,000 to 750,000 GPUs (probably mostly Navi 48 and Navi 44, although we are speculating) in the first quarter, which explains why the company could not meet demand for its Radeon RX 9070 and 9060-series products in the second quarter. The reasons why AMD did not ramp up shipments/production of its Radeon RX 9000-series RDNA 4-based GPUs in late Q4 2024 – early Q1 2025 are unclear. However, JPR's numbers indicate that the company had reduced sales (and possibly production) of GPUs from Q4 to Q1, which is an unprecedented event. This likely means that shortages of AMD's latest Radeon products — the Radeon RX 9060 and 9070 series — will persist at least through the second quarter.

"We were surprised to see AMD's shipments drop so drastically in Q1," said Peddie. "At the same time Nvidia was ramping Blackwell filling any vacuum AMD may have left. Both companies' products have been criticized at the low end, which is traditionally a volume market. But in the past few quarters, the high end has taken off and that is where Nvidia had an open playing field, and so far, still does. So, it is a combination of economic and political instability, and consumer demand shifting to the high end that has caught AMD in a crossfire so to speak."

While shipments of graphics cards were up in the first quarter, sales of desktop processors dropped. JPR reports that the desktop CPU market contracted sharply as volumes dropped by 14.5% year-over-year and 20.6% sequentially.

"The PC market is caught in the crosswinds, some might say crossfire, of Trump's trade wars, with on-again and off-again, special cutout, and changing import/export rules," said Dr. Jon Peddie, president of Jon Peddie Research. "As part of the turmoil, some PC suppliers have pulled back or held orders, while a few have increased orders, hoping to lock in prices. Pre-ordering to lock in prices is a temporary fix, which will cause a depression in future quarters' sales, as discussed here. We think overall PC sales and, subsequently, client PC GPU sales will be down for the year.”

As Apple prepares to unveil iOS 19 at WWDC 2025 on Monday, several rumors have surfaced, including a potential new name for the operating system, an entirely new design inspired by the Vision Pro, and more.  

Here's a roundup of the most notable features rumored to be coming to iOS 19. 

Sources told Bloomberg that Apple plans to rename its operating systems to reflect the release year rather than using version numbers. This means that iOS 19 will be renamed iOS 26, similar to how car model years are designated. This name change will also apply to other software updates, such as iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26.

Anticipated to be the most significant design change since iOS 7, the operating system may feature a complete visual overhaul, one that's reportedly inspired by Apple's Vision Pro headset, according to Bloomberg. This could include translucent panels for navigation and circular app icons. The visionOS-inspired design will be made across Apple's entire ecosystem (including CarPlay) with the goal of creating a more cohesive experience.

Additionally, there are three apps expected to undergo the most changes — the Phone app, Camera, and Safari. For instance, the Phone app is rumored to introduce a new option that allows users to merge their favorite contacts, recent calls, and voicemails into a single view. Meanwhile, both the Camera app and Safari are anticipated to have more visual updates, such as a transparent address bar for Apple's browser app.

Apple is also rumored to be releasing a gaming app that will integrate Apple Arcade and the App Store's game offerings, featuring a central hub for achievements, leaderboards, and App Store content. This comes after the company acquired its first game studio, RAC7, according to DigitalTrends.

Apple may also be developing an AI feature to serve as a personal health coach. This new chatbot is expected to suggest lifestyle changes and provide health advice based on user data collected from the Health app. Additionally, the Health app may be revamped to include a food-tracking feature, allowing users to log their carbohydrate and caffeine intake.

Apple could improve iPhone battery health with AI-powered battery management. This new feature is reported to analyze device usage and make adjustments to conserve battery life. There may also be a new charging icon on the lock screen that gives an estimated time for when it's fully charged.

Another rumor suggests that reverse wireless charging is being tested on the iPhone 17 Pro models, allowing users to charge accessories such as AirPods or the Apple Watch directly from their iPhone.

According to 9to5Mac, the Messages app is set to get an Apple Intelligence-powered translation feature that can automatically translate messages as soon as they hit users' inboxes. 9to5Mac also reports that Apple Intelligence could power a polling feature that lets people in group chats vote and offers AI-generated poll suggestions. 

Additionally, Messages may also add the ability to set a background image, following in the footsteps of WhatsApp and Instagram.

Apple may bring its Preview app from macOS to iPad and iPhone users, allowing them to annotate and edit PDFs. This will reportedly be a preinstalled app, per Bloomberg.

As Bloomberg reports, Genmoji could gain a small yet exciting feature that allows users to combine existing standard emojis, such as a basketball going into a trash can. 

One notable absence from all the rumors is the impressive Siri capabilities highlighted in Apple's 2024 presentation, which featured a more context-aware assistant that can gather information and perform actions across different apps. The company stated in March that the new features are delayed. 

While we can expect some AI-related announcements, the primary focus is likely to be on design changes. Reports indicate that improvements to existing Apple Intelligence features will also be introduced, along with some new additions. 

This story was originally published June 3 and will be updated as more rumors come out.

That being said, there are important differences within the traditional "races", such as the finding in this study that people with West African vs. East African ancestries have different genetic propensities for obesity.Overall I would love it if medical research papers moved away from "race" and started getting more into the fine-grained genetic details. Regardless of the politics involved, this will lead to better medical treatments for everyone.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying there are no differences between ethnicities, just that those differences are based on ancestry not race. People of a specific "race" don't share the same ancestry all the time, some times they have more in common with a different "race" than their own. Race as we know it today is a means of classifying humans that came about at a time when colonial expansion was booming. Classifying people based on their outward appearance was all too convenient. It's like someone learning how to code who found out there are thousands of programming languages and categorized them using terms like "curly brace language","lots of parenthesis language","indentation oriented language". It's lazy and childish. But once you learn more about the languages you should abandon the old ways of classifying things.


reply



That's it. It's a classification system, a taxonomy, a social construction, a coarse categorization (all these things). But it's a bad one that only loosely correlates with a small handful of phenotypes. There isn't zero correlation which is why I disagree, as a matter of precision, with people who say race doesn't exist. The quality of a given taxonomy exists on a spectrum and race is a pretty damn bad one when you consider how inaccurately it separates the phenotypes it claims to care about, and how many genotypes/phenotypes (the vast majority) it fails to separate at all beyond a coin flip.

The journal Nature Human Behaviour published ethics guidelines in Aug 2022 which touch on this:> Race and ethnicity are sociopolitical constructs. Humans do not have biological races, at least based on modern biological criteria for the identification of geographical races or subspecies.> Studies that use the constructs of race and/or ethnicity should explicitly motivate their use. Race/ethnicity should not be used as proxies for other variables — for example, socioeconomic status or income.https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01443-2There was a furore here in the discussion of it on HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32595083

For example, a study indicating that "black people in the US are X% more likely to have {some condition}" is useful, even if "black person in the US" doesn't tell much about an individual's ancestry. That's because health conditions are heavily influenced by environmental factors, and someone's race impacts the environmental factors they're exposed to.This does get complicated, and requires digging deep into the data. Top-level statistics don't indicate root cause, which still needs to be researched. But top-level statistics can indicate that there's a problem that needs to be worked on, which is why medical studies tracking race are still useful.

"Traditional races" as you call them have changed over time and space, and we are only in this predicament because we lump different ethnicities together today. 150 years ago people could tell the difference between someone of West African or East African descent. And Southern Italians, Irish vs Western Europeans vs Germans... etc.It's harder now because a) there has been a lot more mixing since then; and b) socioculturally we consolidated many of those ethnicities

similarly, when working on genomes a few years back, it used to be said that the two most genetically distinct humans alive right then would both be from Africa, which was memorable because one might guess Inuit vs Africa or something like that naively.

To give an example, take 3 people named A, B, and C.  A and B are both from Africa, while C is from elsewhere.A and B have 9 genetic differences.  B and C have 1 genetic difference.  A and C have 10 genetic differences.We can make the claim that the genetic difference between someone from Africa and from elsewhere (B to C, thus 1) is much smaller than the difference between two people in Africa (A to B, thus 9).  1 is smaller than 9, so this statement is true, but could easily be misunderstood to saying that the two most genetically distinct individuals are from Africa, which isn't the case because A to C is the most genetically distinct and C is from elsewhere.The two statements seem nearly equivalent and the wrong one could accidentally be spread by someone who is really just trying to focus on expressing how much genetic diversity is within Africa.

Non-Africans split from Africa relatively late in human genetic history.   So A and B's divergence point(s) can readily be quite a bit earlier than C's.   So, as you pointed out, C is likely more closely related one of A or B.   Let's say B.The big difference between B & C is that B is much more likely to incorporate genes from other early branches than C is.   Therefore B is likely further away genetically from A than C is.

A genetic test takes several days and costs a few hundred dollars.The patient wants the best treatment right now. If race carries useful information that helps the doctor treat the patient, then the doctor should have access to it.

This might sound like nitpicking, but most black people in the US have significant European ancestry and the admixture can vary wildly even for people with similar skin tones. Our naive view of "race" is not always backed by genetic reality.


reply



It's pretty low quality information.   If you're taking a genetic test you want something that returns susceptibility to sickle cell amenia, cystic fibrosis, tay-sachs, et cetera.    Race is a very low quality signal that is used when you lack something better, like a genetic test.

More precision is better, but we don't have rapid genetic tests that can distinguish West vs. East African ancestry on the spot, so race is the only proxy available when you're, say, treating a patient in the ER.

All of a sudden, people have the ability to determine if distant ancestors came from a different continent. Even if it's just 1 or 2% or even a trace amount, they're checking off boxes identifying themselves as multiracial.For the 2020 census, it resulted in a 276% increase in the number of people self-identifying with more than one racial group. This is far more than could be explained by immigration or children born to parents from different backgrounds since 2010.This NPR article (https://www.npr.org/2021/08/28/1030139666/2020-census-result...) explains the dynamic:Its findings suggest adults 50 and up are most likely to self-identify as multiracial on surveys after receiving a report about the potential roots of their family tree based on a DNA analysis of their saliva. The study of more than 100,000 adults registered as potential bone marrow donors in the U.S. also found that DNA test takers were especially likely to identify with three or more racial groups. ..."Native American was the one identity people really wanted to have and really wanted to prove," Roth says, adding that she has also found that some people stopped claiming Native American identity after the results of a test did not show any genetic ancestry.You can imagine the problem when self-reported racial identities could really cloud the waters for determining a suitable bone marrow donor or other health application.

This is not necessarily wrong though. In many cases I've seen where children of grandparents from a particular region showing up on those products as having low percentage heritage from those areas.If your grandmother was born in China and is - for all intents and purposes - clearly Chinese, yet you show up with 3% Chinese DNA on these products, does that mean you can't identify as having Chinese in your family background? Who determines where this line is drawn?

Race was a crude approximation and better techniques are available today. There is a push to use a wider variety of reference genomes which makes sense especially now that that computers are more powerful. There seems to be an assumption by others here that going from an unsophisticated crude approximation to a sophisticated one will somehow validate their other assumption that 'race is only skin deep'. I am not as optimistic.

That said, there is probably a good argument for breaking out at least South Asian from Asian as a distinct top-level racial category, in the same way that MENA recently was. (But note that all of the top-level categories also have more detailed breakdowns available, and recent revisions have also moved to require the more detailed options to collected in a wider range of circumstances.)> The only reason Hispanic is one is because the conquistadors were really, really persistent, murderous, and shameless eh?Mostly, the opposite: that the successors to the conquistadors were less genocidal and more assimilationist than their British and British-descended North American counterparts.

The only reason these groups are included this way is because of lobbying power (for and against) and $$ and privileges related to being in or out of various categories.From an ontological perspective, your argument is BS looking at the actual distributions and ground truth of these groups.

There are hispanic creoles, native american creoles, german creoles, italian creoles, so forth and so on. Because to be a Louisiana creole isn't to rely on any racial marker at all. It just signifies that your ancestors lived here at a particular time.So if someone says that they're Cajun, not creole, they're lying to you. ALL cajuns, without exception, are creole.And most people who claim to be Cajun are either not Cajun at all or they've mistaken their surname for being Cajun.  Like a guy who told me I was wrong about a food item and he knew better because he's a Cajun, being a Champagne from Golden Meadow.Only problem is that Champagne isn't a cajun surname. The Champagne family came over directly from France.You might have seen Isaac Toups on TV hawking a cookbook. The Toups surname is actually German (originally spelled Dubs but the French authorities did their thing), and they landed in the US in 1718-19 in Biloxi, MS.And so on, and so on...I think that some "cajuns" would be more willing to call themselves creole if they knew that in addition to the native americans, the other group that saved their asses when they came to the territory were the German creoles. Those people had it far, far harsher than the Acadian disapora ever did. When they got to the territory, they were not allowed to use beasts of burden for a full decade. This means that when they were dropped off and told to go farm rice (which none of them had ever done before), they had to till their fields and deliver their product to New Orleans from the River Parishes, up to 60 miles away without horses. By the time the Cajuns got here, there were plenty of horses for working the land and other livestock that you were legally allowed to eat.Anyway, that's just one little speck of a much larger ethnic pie.

I assume this refers to figure 7 of the study [1].

Without that, the article isn't even self-consistent - "race is meaningless, it does not perfectly match genetic ancestry from historical geographical groups"? You haven't done away with race, you just renamed it to "African ancestry", "European ancestry", "Asian ancestry", etc.., and found that they have somewhat intermixed in the US.

It's almost like our perceived identity is just a user interface, and the genetic code is the raw assembly language underneath. It makes me wonder, how much of our cultural narrative is shaped by these historical "coding errors" or, perhaps, deliberate obfuscations? And what happens when more and more people start running these genetic "debuggers" on their own personal history? Are we headed for a significant "reboot" of how we understand race and identity in society? Just food for thought.

Nintendo originally billed Virtual Game Cards as the Switch and Switch 2's new means of managing the games, making the process of loading digital titles as simple as slotting in your physical Game Cards from one console to the next. In practice, Virtual Game Cards are one of the more restrictive examples of DRM we've experienced. Not only does it mandate you have a single copy of a game at any time, but you can also only have one instance of local save data on one system. Virtual Game Cards will also restrict you from playing Switch 2 games if you don't have your original Switch nearby.

Those with an original Switch have the option to do a system transfer to the Switch 2 on startup. The process also turns all your digital games into Virtual Game Cards. If you want to play your old games on the original Switch, you have to “eject” the card from the Switch 2 and “load” it on the original Switch. Your save data kept on Nintendo's cloud servers should remain tied to your Nintendo Account, but getting those titles from one system to the other requires both consoles to be in the room at the same time, at least for the first time you set things up.

When we happy few on the Gizmodo consumer tech team received our Switch 2 unit, we weren't considering just how messy this process could get if you didn't think to bring your original Switch. For review, Nintendo granted us codes for Mario Kart World, Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, and a subscription to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. We loaded two of our own profiles onto the Switch but tied those games and services to one account. After spending close to four hours setting up the Switch 2—downloading the big initial system update file and then downloading Mario Kart World off Nintendo's slammed servers—we loaded up the game only to be met with a pop-up window telling us we would need to transfer game cards onto the Switch 2 from the account owner's original Switch.

So we waited 4 hours for the Switch 2 to download Mario Kart World and now it's telling us that I need to have my original Switch on hand in order to play it. Anyone know if unlinking my Nintendo account through the web will mess up my OG Switch? pic.twitter.com/s9DbdLh5tf

After getting to this screen, the only two options we were left with were bringing the Switch 2 near the original Switch or remotely transferring the data from Nintendo's 8-year-old handheld through a browser. This option is meant for people with missing or damaged Switch units, but it's the only way to move forward if you don't have immediate access to your older handheld. Doing so may not brick the original Switch, but it would mean your system would be factory reset and you'd need to reinstate the user account on that device.

Virtual Game Cards have been available to the original Switch family for close to a month, and Nintendo fans already had their share of complaints, but the Switch 2 is throwing these DRM issues into stark relief. When transferring save data from the original Switch to the Switch 2, Nintendo deletes the data on the older console. Unless your files are backed up in cloud saves, you cannot simply jump from one system to another without downloading the save data first. This data transfer can go awry if you don't carefully read any on-screen prompts, as Gizmodo's Senior Editor of Consumer Tech, Raymond Wong, experienced when moving his Mario Kart 8: Deluxe game save to the new handheld. He said he accidentally overrode the transferred game save with a new, no-progress one that was saved in the cloud. It seems the console took the new cloud save as the one dedicated to the Switch 2, effectively deleting hundreds of hours of effort and vehicle unlocks from either system. As Wong voiced on X: why is a game save deleted from a Switch instead of simply copied over to another Switch?

The game save is really gone… I'm heartbroken. Just heartbroken 8 years of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe progress gone in seconds because Nintendo thinks it's smart to delete the game save off the original Switch when transferring it to the Switch 2. WHY is game save deleted and not just… https://t.co/2zxHKTRyGc

Virtual Game Cards don't just hang up the process of playing games on a Switch 2. It means playing games across any of your Switch systems becomes a time-consuming, restrictive hassle. For example, Wong transferred several game saves for newly minted Virtual Game Cards from his Switch to his Switch 2, but in order to play those digital games on his Switch with his progress, he'd need to transfer the game save back from his Switch 2. This can be both annoying and confusing.

Ok this is obnoxious. Apparently I can't play SMM2 like I always have because my Switch Lite is in the other room and powered down. Virtual game cards = 👎 pic.twitter.com/CfSRBZHvi4

The reason Nintendo invented Virtual Game Cards was to make sure nobody had more than one copy of a game tied to any one system. Rather than keeping all your games accessible from any compatible device, like on Steam, Nintendo's digital cards are a kind of digital rights management software that restricts you from sharing your old console with a friend so he can play your library.

If you want to share games with your friends' systems, you can go through the process of temporarily transferring a game you own to their account, so long as they're in your “Family Group.” You have to do this over local wireless, and the game loan times out after two weeks. It's as if Blockbuster came back and started offering game rentals again, except you're doing it through your cousin's Switch 2. Nintendo's obsession with mandating every Switch owner only have a single copy of a game has only entrenched the decline of ownership in gaming. Your save data isn't yours. Your games aren't yours.

Representatives Yvette Clarke (D-NY) and Beth Van Duyne (R-TX) launched the bipartisan Congressional Creators Caucus on Thursday, which aims to support the creator economy.

Though it once seemed like a pipe dream to make a living on the internet, this industry has become a reality — Oxford Economics estimates that YouTube's ecosystem alone powered over 390,000 full-time equivalent jobs in 2022, while Goldman Sachs estimates that the creator economy could be worth half a trillion dollars by 2027.

But the U.S. government doesn't have much regulatory oversight or understanding of the creator economy as it stands, leaving creator businesses in a bind.

“As digital content creators' online presence continues to reach billions globally, Congress must work to ensure resources and protections are in place to support their success in this new era of start-ups,” Representative Clarke said in a statement.

Matthew Patrick (MatPat) and Stephanie Patrick, who founded the popular digital production studio Theorist Media, spoke at a press event for the launch of the caucus. The husband and wife duo have spent over a year lobbying on Capitol Hill to advocate for creators' needs.

“We're trying to educate lawmakers about what the creator economy is, and that it's an actual job and that we are actually small businesses, and as a result, there are certain tax codes and things that apply to small businesses,” Matthew Patrick (the creator known as MatPat) told TechCrunch last year. “Even when you talk to accountants, they're like, well, are you though? Because there's not a clear indicator on tax forms — like, what is a creator business?”

The Patricks have also pushed to point out that the creator economy isn't an industry confined to the coasts, in entertainment industry hotspots like New York City and Los Angeles — rather, it's an industry that needs support across the nation. Theorist Media and MrBeast, the most popular YouTubers in the world, are both based in North Carolina. Meanwhile, John and Hank Green have used their success on YouTube to launch businesses like the educational media company Complexly, which has headquarters in Indiana and Montana.

Patreon and YouTube, two of the most vital companies that help creator businesses operate, have affirmed their support for the new caucus.

As a Patreon blog post explains, creators often build businesses without the same protections that more traditional businesses have, like insurance, disaster relief, and access to loans. Even startups like Karat Financial have sprung up to fill in some of these gaps, providing business credit cards and banking to creators who are often denied these services because legacy financial institutions don't understand their businesses.

“Too often, creators are overlooked in economic policy discussions—despite being small business owners, employers, and cultural tastemakers in every congressional district,” explained Courtney Duffy, Patreon's Head of External Affairs and Strategic Engagement, in a statement. “The bipartisan Congressional Creators Caucus is a crucial step toward recognizing their impact and ensuring they have a seat at the table in shaping the policies that affect their livelihoods.”

Fitness equipment maker Peloton‘s CEO Peter Stern has said the company is exploring ways to expand its customer base by making its products available for use in gyms and launching a peer-to-peer marketplace for used equipment.

Speaking at Bloomberg Tech Summit on Thursday, Stern said Peloton plans to distribute its machines to commercial gyms via its subsidiary Precor, a gym equipment supplier, and is working to add Peloton workouts to compatible Precor equipment.

The company this week also set out to grab a share of the market for used Peloton equipment, launching a peer-to-peer marketplace called Repowered. “Historically, [secondhand sales have] taken place, for example, on Facebook marketplace, and that's absolutely fine for people who want to do that, but it means that you need to transact with a stranger on both ends, and potentially have that stranger come into your home. What we're trying to do is streamline that and deliver a more premium experience for those secondhand customers,” he said.

Stern said the company aims to use AI to improve personalization for its members. “I want to find ways to scale coaching by creating individualized programs for each of our members so that they can get the right class from the right instructor that's personalized for them,” he said.

Of all the egomaniacal lions who ruled Hollywood during the 20th century gatekeeper era, very few made a brilliant pivot to the internet. The exception is Barry Diller. After leading programming at ABC, running Paramount, and supercharging Fox by launching its broadcast network in the late 1980s, Diller no longer wanted to work for anyone else. Either you are or you aren't, he said of independence. As a free agent he quickly grasped the power of interactivity and built an empire that includes Expedia Group, almost the entire online dating sector (Tinder, Match, OkCupid), and an online media lineup that includes People, which wrote a hit piece on him early in his career titled “Failing Upwards.”

In his absorbing memoir, Who Knew, the third act of Diller's career gets short shrift, as the road to becoming an internet billionaire is dispatched in a few dozen pages. The bulk of the book weaves his life as a not-quite-out gay man (who nonetheless passionately loves his iconic wife Diane von Furstenberg) with a deliciously dishy account of his Hollywood days. So as a WIRED kind of reader, I start our interview by calling him out on the tea shortage regarding his life in tech.

With Diane von Fürstenberg in the Dominican Republic.

“What do you mean?” growls Diller, a notorious suffer-no-fools guy, who two weeks after publication is undoubtedly getting tired of book promotion. When I tell him I just wanted to hear wonderful details from his tech days, like the ones he shared about his earlier acts, his demeanor changes, and he cheerfully agrees with me. “I did whiz by it,” he says of his internet triumphs, citing time constraints. (Note: the book was 15 years in the making.) “It is something I should have done and I didn't do.”

This is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter.

I try to make up for the omission in our conversation. To get things started, I remind him of a 1993 Ken Auletta New Yorker profile titled, “Barry Diller's Search for the Future.” It describes Diller's quest for a post-Hollywood third act using the metaphor of his newly found obsession with an Apple PowerBook. A decade into the PC revolution, the idea of a media mogul actually using a computer was a novelty, and Auletta acted as if Diller had invented public key cryptography.

But the PowerBook was critical, says Diller. During his first job, as a 20-year-old working the mail room at William Morris, he buried himself in the archives and tried to read every single file and contract to understand the nuances of the business. In every subsequent job, he set out to absorb voluminous information before making critical decisions. It was his superpower. With the Apple laptop now he could have all this data at his fingertips. “I could do everything myself,” he says. “Tech has basically rescued me from my own obsolescence.” In the early '90s—the perfect time to learn about the digital world, just before the boom—he went on a high-tech listening tour that included visits to Microsoft and the MIT Media Lab. “My eyes were saucers,” he says. “I ate every inch up.”

He also met Steve Jobs on his tour, who showed him the first few reels of a movie he was working on called Toy Story. “I've never had an aptitude for animation—I don't like it,” Diller says. “Of course he was right and I was wrong. He pounded me to join the Pixar board, and I just didn't want to do it. Steve doesn't like to be turned down.” Diller describes his relationship with Jobs thereafter as tension-packed. He marveled at Jobs' business savvy but despised his scorched-earth tactics. “The idea of having a 30 percent tax on going through the Apple store was, and is, an absolute outrage. It was pure Steve. But it's breaking apart now,” he adds, referring to recent antitrust litigation that he's clearly following.

When the internet took off, Diller went on a buying binge. Some prizes are mostly forgotten—CitySearch?—but others were inspired. He convinced Microsoft's Steve Ballmer to sell him Expedia, and it became the centerpiece of a travel group that now includes Hotels.com, Orbitz, and Vrbo. The total valuation of his companies is now over $100 billion. He credits most of it to “luck, circumstance, and timing.”

The book provides evidence that there's more to Diller's success than happenstance. Even before becoming his own boss, Diller operated like a founder. He joined ABC in his mid-twenties as a woefully inexperienced nobody, and bucked decades of tradition by arguing that the network should show films in prime time—and the ratings blockbuster Movie of the Week was born. Then he pushed ABC to make its own movies, and even created the mini-series, notably Roots. He invented prestige TV! When I tell Diller that this feat seemed to presage Netflix's entry into original content, he agrees, and adds a bit of commentary to Hollywood's current struggle with tech giants. “The incumbents stood by while Netflix took their business away from them,” he says. Meanwhile, he says, Apple and Amazon started their streaming services with different business incentives—the former to keep people in its ecosystem, the latter to keep customers signed up to Prime. “It's hard to compete against that,” he says “It's not that these old media companies aren't going to survive. It's just they're never going to be the dominant player anymore. That's just gone.”

He writes that while the people he knows in the “algorithmic” movie business are even richer than the ones he hung out with earlier in his career, “I don't know anyone who is having any fun.” In our conversation, he extols the satisfying process of creating a narrative film and bringing it to market. In comparison, the best tech has to offer is something like Tinder. When he first saw its nascent form—it basically adopted the “hot or not” format to a dating app—he saw great possibilities, and snapped up the team. Then came months of technical development. “The result was something thrilling, but it pales in comparison to the creation of content,” he says.

Diller, of course, is on top of the AI revolution. “It's going to change so many things,” he says, comparing it to the shift from analog to digital. “Do you know Sam Altman?” I ask. I should have known better. The man who just wrote a book dropping the name of every Hollywood royal of the past 40 years says, “Sam is one of my closest friends, and has been since before he became Sam Altman.” Until recently, Altman sat on the Expedia board and helped the company integrate AI into the app.

I mention that if ChatGPT had existed when Diller first worked in the William Morris mailroom, he wouldn't have had to painstakingly read every file. He could have simply uploaded the trove into a large language model and asked it questions. Anyone who did that would have Diller's superpower! “I think you're right,” he says. “That's why I think the future is unpredictable.” Unless, as Alan Kay once said, you invent it.

Resin printing just got even better.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A team of scientists and developers from both the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has put together an impressive resin 3D printer that is able to create more than one material from the same resin. Even more exciting is that one of those materials is dissolvable, making it an ideal option for printing supports in place.

In the world of 3D printing, there are two types of printers leading the way: fused deposition modeling (FDM) and resin printers. FDM printers are the ones you see squeezing filament out of an extruder onto a print bed. Resin printers rely on precise light exposure to build layers in a vat of liquid resin. It's through this technology that the team was able to hone in on specific wavelengths to generate the differing materials.

According to the team, the resin is comprised mostly of acrylate monomers and epoxy, which is crucial. The printer is designed to use two different types of light beams when printing. One is ultraviolet, while the other is just visible light. Focusing these lights in tandem allows the printer to develop multiple materials from a single resin.

When the UV light is focused into the resin, solid permanent structures are formed. This is used for the main object you're printing. When visible light hits the same resin, a solid material is formed that will dissolve in 15 minutes when placed in a lye solution. This is what makes the material ideal for printing supports.

To demonstrate the system in action, the team has created a handful of objects that would be impossible to print otherwise. For example, they managed to print a ball suspended in a cage that moves about freely once the support material is dissolved. They also created a chain of interlocked rings and a checkerboard pattern.

If you're new to 3D printing or are looking to upgrade your current printer, check out our list of best 3D printers to see which ones we personally recommend. This also gives you an idea of what's leading the market. Unfortunately, you won't find any resin printers capable of creating two materials from a single resin but in the meantime, we can at least appreciate the work this team has done so far to innovate how we handle resin printing.

Theories range from poor quality seals to staff needing to check if the Mario Kart World code was still inside.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Several Nintendo fans who just received their Switch 2 and Mario Kart World bundle claim to have received boxes that had broken seals on them. According to multiple Reddit posts, the issue is widespread with several British retailers affected, including Currys, Argos, John Lewis, and Smyths — even those who reportedly purchased directly from Nintendo received boxes with broken seals.

One Redditor claimed Argos staff told him that the issue was caused by Nintendo using “seals with insufficient strength,” leading to them breaking while in transit or storage. On the other hand, others claim that the seal was cut cleanly, as if with a knife or scissors, meaning it was unlikely to have happened accidentally.

Someone who picked up their pre-order from Currys had the same issue. When they asked the staff about it, they were told that the boxes had to be opened to check if the Mario Kart World code was inside the box. Some customers reported that their code was missing, so someone in the supply chain, at least in the UK, took it upon themselves to check for them. One even said seeing getting an “opened and examined” sticker on their retail box, possibly indicating that their newly-purchased handheld console had been tampered with.

One commenter also claimed that they bought theirs in Italy, and they have the same issue. They said that they bought it from Unieuro, and the staff claimed that the whole stock arrived in their store in that condition.

There's no official statement from Nintendo or other retailers about this yet, but it seems that the affected units all had the Mario Kart World bundle. EE and Currys were not immediately available for comment. Argos declined to comment on the story.

Nevertheless, even though the units had broken seals, it looks like nothing inside the affected boxes is missing. This will give affected buyers some relief, especially as a few were already worried that they're getting a tampered unit or receiving rocks instead of the handheld.

This isn't the first brouhaha Nintendo is facing with the launch of its most-awaited console. GameStop customers in the U.S. were flabbergasted to find that the staples used to stick their receipts on the box had punctured through the thin protective cardboard layer and damaged the screen of their console. While a few were frustrated at the retailer for doing so, many more were disappointed at Nintendo because its packaging wasn't as protective of the precious contents as it should be.

A $1,520 saving doesn't make the price any less eye-watering

In the ever-evolving world of insane GPU prices, tariffs, and frightful stock shortages, one intrepid PC builder has managed to swipe an Nvidia RTX 5090 from Walmart for "just" $1,679, more than $200 below MSRP.

Redditor Sufficient_Crazy7758 took to the platform to hail their purchase of the "Cheapest 5090 ever?", after scooping a PNY GeForce RTX 5090 from Walmart for the relatively low price of $1,679.99. The attached images reveal that the card was discounted by over $1,500 on May 25, having previously been discounted on May 13.

"Just so all of you know, I bought this on that date and it has worked flawlessly ever since," they said triumphantly.

Naturally, commenters pressed to find out how they'd come about such a ludicrous bargain. "Local Walmart, they said it was a 3rd party return and nobody bought it, so I jumped on it," they revealed.

Despite the jeopardy of buying a third-party return, the deal is so good that some even postulated whether the poster worked at Walmart and had marked down the price themselves before hiding the card long enough to mark it down again.

Buying up third-party returns is probably not the first port of call you should consider when shopping for the best graphics cards, but when it comes to the wild MSRPs of the top-end Nvidia RTX 50 series, and the even more expensive AIB options, maybe taking a risk is worth it, it certainly paid off for this customer.

The card in question appears to be the PNY triple fan (but not the EPIC-X ARGB) version, which retails at an astonishing $3,499 at Walmart. Despite launching all the way back in January, even the Founders Edition still retails for the same price, way over the $1,999 MSRP.

AMD is looking for people to help it change the AI game.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AMD has announced that it has just acquired Toronto-based AI chip company Untether AI. This isn't the usual corporate acquisition, though, where the bigger firm completely buys the smaller one. Instead, AMD only hired the entire engineering team of Untether, leaving everything else behind. Because of this, its speedAI AI inference processor and imAIgine SDK will no longer be supplied and supported, according to Untether AI's announcement.

“AMD has entered into a strategic agreement to acquire a talented team of AI hardware and software engineers from Untether AI,” AMD said in a statement to CRN. “The transaction brings a world-class team of engineers to AMD, focusing on advancing the company's AI compiler and kernel development capabilities as well as enhancing our digital and SoC design, design verification, and product integration capabilities. We are excited to welcome the team's unique expertise to AMD.”

Untether AI specializes in building AI chips specifically designed for AI inference. While GPUs like Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra or AMD's Instinct MI350 excel at training AI models, speedAI performs better in inferencing and is far more energy efficient than these power-hungry GPUs. They achieve that by placing the processors right next to the memory, reducing latency and power consumption.

It's unclear how many clients Untether AI has and how they will be affected by this change, especially as AMD did not purchase Untether AI's assets. This meant that companies that bought the latter's products were left holding the bag.

At the same time, this massive hiring is a sign that AMD is expanding its capabilities to challenge Nvidia in other AI-related fields, not just the raw computing horsepower of AI GPUs. Just one day before this announcement, Team Red also announced its acquisition of Brium, a startup that focuses on AI inference optimization.

These deals point to the company focusing on the next major step in AI development — inferencing. Justin Kinsey, President of semiconductor recruiting firm SBT Industries, said in a LinkedIn post, “AMD's acquisition of Untether's engineering group is proof that the GPU vendors know model training is over, and that a decline in GPU revenue is around the corner.” Although this is a bold prediction, Kinsey says that this has been an emerging pattern in the past six months.

As the AI power bill keeps increasing every year, companies will likely soon look for alternatives that are far more efficient. The current AI GPUs that require hundreds of watts are highly suitable for training, but they consume too much power for AI inference. If AMD can deliver a specialized chip just for this application, it could potentially challenge Nvidia's dominance, especially as the AI industry continues to mature.

AMD's RX 9060 XT launches today, starting at $299 for the 8GB model and $349 for the 16GB version. AMD has positioned the RX 9060 XT to fend off the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti (especially the 8GB variant) at both MSRP levels. The new GPU will vie for a spot in our list of best graphics cards once our RX 9060 XT review is out.

The RX 9060 XT is AMD's latest RX 9000-series GPU, boasting the same RDNA 4 architecture as the RX 9070 series. The GPU is quite literally an RX 9070 XT cut in half, sporting 32 CUs, 2,048 shader cores, and a 128-bit memory interface. AMD is hitting the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti's weak points by offering its 16GB variant at a lower price than the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB and re-introducing a full x16 PCIe configuration to the RX 9060 XT, giving it a performance edge (particularly the 8GB model) against its Blackwell competitors in older systems where PCIe 4.0 and 5.0 support may not be available.

However, just like the RTX 5060 and the 8GB version of the RTX 5060 Ti, AMD has received heavy criticism for offering an 8GB version of the RX 9060 XT. Before launch, Frank Azor famously stated on X that "The Majority of gamers are still playing at 1080p and have no use for more than 8GB of memory," even though some AAA games are already consuming more than 8GB of video memory at 1080p with ultra graphics settings. Worse, AMD neglected to give any reviewers the 8GB model of the RX 9060 XT for testing, forcing them only to test the 16GB model.

Third-party reviewer testing shows the RX 9060 XT 16GB performing 10-20% better than the RTX 5060 on average, depending on the resolution. Naturally, you'll need to do in-depth research on the types of games and resolution that you prefer before pulling the trigger.

If you do opt for the 9060 XT, we've put a list of all partner cards below that you'll be able to buy from US-based retailers:

A U.S. court denied Apple a stay on a ruling that requires the company to stop charging developers for payments made outside the App Store through links in apps.

This means in the U.S., Apple will no longer be able to charge developers a fee when customers click on a link within their app that takes them outside the App Store for payment, resulting in a potential loss of revenue to the company.

“Apple ‘bears the burden of showing that the circumstances justify an exercise of [our] discretion,'” the court said in a filing. “After reviewing the relevant factors, we are not persuaded that a stay is appropriate,” it added.

Epic Games' head Tim Sweeney applauded the court's ruling and said, “The long national nightmare of Apple tax is ended,” in a post on X.

Apple called the denial of stay disappointing in a statement.

“We are disappointed with the decision not to stay the district court's order, and we'll continue to argue our case during the appeals process. As we've said before, we strongly disagree with the district court's opinion. Our goal is to ensure the App Store remains an incredible opportunity for developers and a safe and trusted experience for our users,” an Apple spokesperson said.

In April, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled in favor of Epic Games, saying that Apple was in “willful violation” of a 2021 injunction that barred the company from forcing anticompetitive pricing. This essentially means that Apple must change the App Store rules and allow developers to freely link to their website for purchasing digital goods.

In response, Apple filed an emergency motion last month seeking a stay on the court's ruling. The company also filed an appeal against the ruling around the same time.Last year, Apple began allowing other apps to link out and use non-Apple payment mechanisms, but it still took a 27% fee and added what critics called “scare screens.” With the new ruling, both practices will be eliminated.

Large companies are already making changes to their apps, with Spotify and Amazon publishing new updates that let users pay for their subscriptions and purchases outside the App Store. 

With the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) slotted for next week, this is a big blow to Apple. Earlier this week, the company published a report saying that it generated $1.3 trillion in billings and sales in 2024. It added 90% of those sales didn't generate commission revenue for Apple.

The story has been updated with Apple's comment.

For students and those who live on a small budget, shelling out $1,000 (or even $2,000) for a MacBook is an out-of-reach dream. Fortunately, this year's market offers a great alternative without having you compromise on performance or features: The Lenovo IdeaPad 15.6″ Touchscreen FHD Laptop, which was released this year, is currently on Amazon for a price so cheap it's not thought to be true.

For a record 70% discount, the 15.6-inch portable computer (16GB RAM, 512GB storage) is on sale for $549, down from its regular price of $1,849. This isn't a sale, it's a clearance and Amazon seems to be clearing out its stock with a deal that makes this Windows 11 Pro S laptop one of the best deals going.

See at Amazon







The Lenovo IdeaPad in question is a touchscreen 15.6-inch machine, so it's perfect for work and play. Its Full HD (1920×1080) IPS display offers an anti-glare, clear view at 300 nits brightness which makes it easy to see comfortably in a bright room or outdoors. The inclusion of a responsive touchscreen is the icing on the cake and makes easy navigation and instant availability of apps and features possible.

Under the hood, this laptop is powered by a 12th Gen Intel Core i5-1235U processor (10 cores: 2 performance + 8 efficiency cores, 12 threads) with speeds ranging from 1.3 GHz up to 4.4 GHz. With this setup, this 2025 IdeaPad can easily handle demanding tasks such as multitasking with many browser windows open, using creative tools, or even light gaming.







Memory and storage are two areas where this IdeaPad is great, especially for its price point. With 16GB of DDR4 RAM, you'll enjoy smooth performance whether you're editing documents, streaming videos, or switching between applications. The 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD provides ample space for your files, while also ensuring fast boot times and quick access to your data. There is also a useful selection of ports: 1x USB 2.0, 1x USB 3.2 Gen 1, 1x USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 (support data transfer only), 1x HDMI 1.4b, 1x Card reader, 1x Headphone/microphone combo jack (3.5mm), and 1x Power connector.

Lenovo IdeaPad comes with Windows 11 Professional in S mode, which gives a safe and optimized experience right from the box. The laptop's Abyss Blue finish adds a sleek, modern look. Customers also receive a Wendbo Cable bundled with the purchase.

With Amazon's current promotion, you're getting a laptop that would normally cost nearly four times as much: make sure you get yours before it runs out of stock!

If you've recently searched for the Samsung Galaxy S25+ 512GB on Amazon, you might have come across something peculiar: the price is not visible. Rather it states “price hidden” until you put it in your cart. This is because of a very special trade agreement with Samsung: The manufacturer is wanting to keep price drops like this a secret – especially as it was released just a few months ago.

On Amazon, the Galaxy S25+ 512GB is on sale at its lowest point to date for a limited time only: The 512GB model can be purchased for $869 which is 22% off the original list price of $1119. It's obviously also a lot cheaper than if you get it from the official Samsung's store. Make sure you grab yours before it runs out of stock!

See at Amazon

Launched at the start of 2025, the Galaxy S25+ is a more powerful phone than the regular S25 with extra features to match. Both phones have the same basics: unlocked Android, smart AI cameras, and Samsung's latest ProScaler display. But the S25+ adds more upgrades, which makes the higher price so much worthwhile. On top of that, with the current discount, le S25+ is more affordable than the standard S25.

If you're looking for differences, the Galaxy S25 has a smaller 6.2-inch FHD+ display and starts with 128GB or 256GB of storage while the S25+ offers a larger 6.7-inch QHD+ screen and storage options of 256GB or 512GB (which is the one on sale right now). The S25+ also benefits from a higher pixel density, which makes images and text appear sharper.

Beyond display and storage, the Galaxy S25+ stands out with a bigger battery (4,900mAh compared to the S25's 4,000mAh) for longer battery life for heavy users. The S25+ also supports ultra-wideband connectivity which is not available on the standard Galaxy S25 and enables features like precise device tracking and secure digital car keys.

The best part of this Amazon deal is that the Galaxy S25+ 512GB now costs less than many standard S25 models, thanks to Amazon's limited-time sale. It's hard to find a better price for a top phone with all the newest features. The S25+ is unlocked, so you can use it with any carrier, and it comes with a one-year warranty for extra peace of mind.

Just keep in mind that you will need to add it to your cart to see the real price: Samsung is not allowing Amazon to disclose the full discount of the price in public.

Silicon Valley investors and tech executives who loudly supported both US president Donald Trump and Elon Musk may now be forced to pick sides as the president of the United States and the world's richest man go through an extremely messy public breakup.

Their high-profile bromance imploded this week when Musk began using his social media platform X to denounce Trump's signature policy initiative, known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which experts say would cut taxes, reduce health care benefits for poor people, and dramatically increase funding for immigration enforcement, while also adding trillions of dollars to the federal deficit.

Musk has called the bill “a disgusting abomination” and claimed Congress is “making America bankrupt.” Trump responded on Thursday by suggesting he might cancel contracts Musk's companies have with the federal government. During a press conference the same day, Trump floated the idea that Musk was angry about the bill because it also eliminates subsidies for electric vehicles that benefit Tesla.

Trump gave Musk—a private citizen—unprecedented access to the White House and federal government by appointing him to run the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Their alliance was emblematic of a new era in Washington, where top Silicon Valley figures used their massive online platforms to support a candidate they believed would be good for business.

The feud is putting pressure on some of Musk's closest associates from the tech industry, including Trump's AI and crypto czar David Sacks, Marc Andreessen, and other investors, to choose whether to align themselves with the Tesla CEO or continue supporting the president. So far, some people appear to be trying to walk a fine line between backing Musk while not outwardly criticizing the White House.

“Elon leaves it all on the field, and he puts what he believes in ahead of himself,” Shaun Maguire, a partner at Sequoia Capital who says he donated $300,000 to Trump last year, tweeted on Thursday. “How can you not be inspired by that? (Even if you disagree with him).”

Brad Gerstner, the founder of Altimeter Capital, took a different tack when asked by a Bloomberg reporter at a tech conference on Wednesday night about Musk's criticism of Trump's bill. “I'm a big fan of Elon,” Gerstner said, “and I also believe, and have fought for 30 years, over the fact that we need some sort of balanced budget amendment in the country.” He added that it was “unconscionable that we live a higher standard of living today by borrowing on a credit card that's going to come due” and is hoping the country finds its way to a “four- or five-year plan laid out by this administration.”

In one of a series of rapid-fire posts on social media criticizing Trump and his administration on Thursday, Musk asked his more than 220 million followers whether it was time to “create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle.” In a reply, venture capitalist and Y Combinator president Garry Tan wrote that “kitchen table abundance” rather than “a bunch of grifting BS and virtue signaling and culture wars” should be prioritized. Aaron Levie, CEO of the cloud storage company Box, also voiced his support for Musk's idea.

Some of Trump's high-profile backers from Silicon Valley stayed mostly quiet during the Trump-Musk flare-up on Thursday or tried to turn attention to other topics, including Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya, two tech industry veterans who are also hosts of the enormously popular All In podcast, which has featured friendly interviews with Trump and some of his cabinet appointees in recent months.

As of Thursday afternoon, Palihapitya was posting on X about crypto, while Sacks shared a recent New York Times op-ed about AI policy. But their fellow podcast hosts, David Friedberg and Jason Calacanis, posted what appeared to be cryptic references to the drama.

“​China just won,” Friedberg wrote on social media. “There are no true friends in politics—only mutual interests,” Calacanis said in a separate message. He followed up with a meme portraying Musk as rapper Kendrick Lamar, who was recently involved in a tense feud with fellow musician Drake.

“Can't wait to see the All In podcast guys political beliefs disappear overnight,” Dar Sleeper, a former Tesla product manager, quipped on X.

Adam Kovacevich, a former Google executive and the current CEO of the tech industry trade group Chamber of Progress, says he thinks the current Musk-Trump riff doesn't get at the heart of what most tech business leaders are really concerned about with the current administration.

“I don't want to overstate the rupture, but the vast majority of people in the tech industry aren't aligned with anybody right now,” Kovacevich says. “Some might appreciate what Trump has done, calling off SEC lawsuits against crypto and calling off the Biden order on AI, but at the same time there's still a lot of angst about tariffs. That's the single biggest issue for tech right now.”

A former Democratic operative who now works at a tech investment firm says that, while the Trump-Musk fight will indeed force some people to choose a side, it won't be a straightforward decision for many of them. “This isn't 2012—there are all these different strands making up the Trump alliance now,” says the operative, who asked to remain anonymous because they weren't authorized by their employer to speak to the media.

“The basic issue is that Elon was the gateway for people going from the traditionally Democratic tech industry towards Trump and the Republican party. And now the question is, will Elon be the gateway for the tech industry to come back to the left?” the source says.

Two sources who spoke to WIRED say that some investors and technologists might not be quick to embrace Musk because they are disappointed by how he handled DOGE. “A lot of people put tremendous faith in the idea that DOGE could shake up the government,” the former Democratic operative says, but the reality is that Washington is a different world from tech. “It's the least worst outcome for many, not the best outcome for a few.”

As the sun began to set outside the White House on Thursday, Trump and Musk were still trading barbs—and there's little sign their battle will end anytime soon. In fact, this may be only the beginning. As right-leaning tech investor Mike Solana put it on X: “And so, as foretold, the great tech right/populist right-wing schism of 2025 begins.”

We have all heard of antibodies – proteins produced by our bodies to bind to viruses or bacteria, marking them for elimination by the immune system. But not all of us are familiar with aptamers: short segments of DNA or RNA that are designed to bind, like antibodies, to specific targets. Synthetic and inexpensive to produce, aptamers are attractive alternatives to antibodies for biomedical diagnostics and therapeutics.

When new aptamer binders are needed, for example to detect a new virus, they are developed from libraries of millions of nucleic acid sequences from which the best matches for a given target are selected and amplified. Until now, such libraries contained only monovalent binders: sequences that bind to one site on a target molecule. But this contrasts with the structure of many real-world proteins, including the SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and HIV spike proteins. These structures, which viruses use to infect cells, are comprised of three identical subunits presenting three potential binding sites.

Unfortunately, using monovalent binders for these three-unit (trimeric) complexes is hit-or-miss. In fact, Maartje Bastings, head of the Programmable Biomaterials Lab in EPFL's School of Engineering, compares it to "throwing a bowl of spaghetti at the wall, as something will certainly stick somewhere."

You can't control where a monovalent binder interacts with its target: for example, it may bind to the side of a protein, rather than the binding interface, reducing its functionality. In other words, you can't choose the spot on the wall where a certain spaghetti noodle will stick. So, we thought: wouldn't it be better or pre-organize our library for binders that fit a target's exact geometry? And this approach turns out to be magically effective."

Maartje Bastings, Head of the Programmable Biomaterials Lab in EPFL's School of Engineering

Bastings and her team have recently reported the first technique for producing multimeric aptamers, which target protein complexes with unprecedented precision and functionality. Indeed, the binders developed with the lab's approach, dubbed MEDUSA (Multivalent Evolved DNA-based SUpramolecular Assemblies), yields binding affinities that are between 10 and 1,000 times stronger than those achieved with monovalent binders. In addition to being stronger, they also turned out to be much more selective, which is critical for diagnostics. The research has been published in Nature Nanotechnology.

The key to developing trimeric binders is the scaffold: a molecular structure around which three binding units naturally assemble. In their experiments, the researchers developed their scaffold based on the geometry of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. By adding these tailored scaffolds to their aptamer library, the team was able to bias the sequence space toward trimeric candidates that would bind functionally to the target interface right from the start.

"We have retro-engineered the natural paradigm seen in viruses, in which multivalent molecular complexes co-evolve, and translated it into a new binder discovery method that allows us to select multivalent binders that can block such viruses," summarizes PhD student and first author Artem Kononenko.

Once a first batch of binders is identified, candidates with increasing affinity for their target are developed through an iterative process of selection and amplification called 'evolution'.

Although designing new scaffolds can take a matter of hours, the evolution process can take weeks. Looking ahead, the research team aims to shorten this timeframe to better suit the needs of biomedical diagnostics and therapeutics.

Another goal is to develop multimeric binders targeting pathogens with even more complex configurations, like Dengue fever (six binding subunits) or anthrax (seven). "Ultimately, we want to use this new multivalent sequence space to train generative artificial intelligence models to do this for us," Bastings says.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for the majority of lung cancer cases and remains a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are common in NSCLC and have made EGFR-targeting drugs like osimertinib a cornerstone of treatment. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have also transformed the treatment landscape by reactivating the immune system to attack tumors. Despite their promise, combining these two therapies has proven problematic. Several clinical trials were halted after reporting high incidences of severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs)—such as interstitial pneumonia and hepatitis—linked to the combination. Due to these risks and the lack of mechanistic clarity, there is an urgent need to investigate the cellular drivers of this toxicity and identify safer strategies.

A research team from Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute & Hospital published their findings (DOI: 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2024.0269) in Cancer Biology & Medicine, aiming to demystify the heightened immune toxicity triggered by osimertinib-ICI co-treatment. Through the development of a specialized mouse model mimicking irAEs seen in patients, the team pinpointed activation of the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling cascade in liver macrophages as the culprit. Their results not only offer a compelling explanation for these adverse reactions but also suggest that this toxicity may be preventable through targeted pharmacological intervention.

To explore the root cause of irAEs, the researchers administered osimertinib and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in mice, which resulted in pronounced lung and liver inflammation, increased EGFR expression on macrophages, and elevated blood levels of IL-6, ALT, and ferritin. Notably, flow cytometry revealed that EGFR expression was exclusive to macrophages, not T or NK cells. RNA sequencing confirmed the upregulation of inflammatory signaling, particularly the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 pathway, which was further validated via Western blot analysis. The turning point came when ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, was introduced into the regimen—leading to a marked decrease in inflammatory cytokines despite ongoing tissue-level inflammation. This finding suggests that systemic cytokine release, rather than local tissue damage, may be a more sensitive indicator of irAEs. The study proposes that osimertinib's inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation in macrophages, when combined with ICI-induced immune activation, triggers this inflammatory cascade. These results not only clarify the pathway responsible for irAEs but also spotlight ruxolitinib as a potentially safe and effective countermeasure.

Our findings provide a crucial mechanistic link between osimertinib-ICI therapy and the dangerous cytokine surges seen in patients. By pinpointing the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 axis in liver macrophages, we not only clarify the pathogenesis of immune-related toxicity, but also suggest that targeted inhibitors like ruxolitinib can be safely integrated into cancer immunotherapy regimens. This represents a significant step toward safer combination treatments."

Dr. Xiubao Ren, corresponding author of the study

This research delivers a mechanistic blueprint for understanding and managing irAEs in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients receiving combination therapy. By selectively inhibiting the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 pathway, clinicians may be able to protect patients from serious inflammatory reactions while preserving the anti-cancer potency of both osimertinib and ICIs. These results pave the way for future clinical trials to assess IL-6 pathway blockers as adjunct therapies in cancer immunotherapy. If successful, this strategy could significantly improve patient safety and expand the clinical utility of EGFR-TKI and ICI combination regimens.

A combination of facial thermal imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) can accurately predict the presence of coronary artery disease, finds research published in the open access journal BMJ Health & Care Informatics.

This non-invasive real-time approach is more effective than conventional methods and could be adopted for clinical practice to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and workflow, pending testing on larger and more ethnically diverse numbers of patients, suggest the researchers.

Current guidelines for the diagnosis of coronary heart disease rely on probability assessment of risk factors which aren't always very accurate or widely applicable, say the researchers. 

And while these can be supplemented with other diagnostics, such as ECG readings, angiograms, and blood tests, these are often time consuming and invasive, they add.

Thermal imaging, which captures temperature distribution and variations on the object's surface by detecting the infrared radiation emitted by that object, is non-invasive. 

And it has emerged as a promising tool for disease assessment as it can identify areas of abnormal blood circulation and inflammation from skin temperature patterns.

The advent of machine learning technology (AI), with its capacity to extract, process, and integrate complex information, might enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of thermal imaging diagnostics.

The researchers therefore set out to look into the feasibility of using thermal imaging plus AI to accurately predict the presence of coronary artery disease without the need for invasive, time consuming techniques in 460 people with suspected heart disease.Their average age was 58; 126 (27.5%) of them were women. 

Thermal images of their faces were captured before confirmatory examinations to develop and validate an AI assisted imaging model for detecting coronary artery disease.

In all, 322 participants (70%) were confirmed to have coronary artery disease. These people tended to be older and they were more likely to be men. They were also more likely to have lifestyle, clinical, and biochemical risk factors, as well as higher use of preventive meds.

The thermal imaging plus AI approach was around 13% better at predicting coronary artery disease than the pre-test risk assessment involving traditional risk factors and clinical signs and symptoms.

Among the three most significant predictive thermal indicators, the most influential was the overall left-right temperature difference of the face, followed by the maximal facial temperature, and average facial temperature.

And, specifically, the average temperature of the left jaw region was the strongest predictive feature, followed by the temperature range of the right eye region and the left-right temperature difference of the left temple regions.

 The approach also effectively identified traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease: high cholesterol; male sex; smoking; excess weight (BMI); fasting blood glucose, as well as indicators of inflammation.

The researchers acknowledge the relatively small sample size of their study and the fact that it was carried out at only one centre. And the study participants had all been referred for confirmatory tests for suspected heart disease.

But they nevertheless write: "The feasibility of thermal imaging based coronary artery disease prediction suggests potential future applications and research opportunities."

They add: "As a biophysiological-based health assessment modality, it provides disease-relevant Information beyond traditional clinical measures that could enhance atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease] and related chronic condition assessment. 

"The non-contact, real-time nature of it allows for instant disease assessment at the point of care, which could streamline clinical workflows and save time for important physician-patient decision-making. In addition, it has the potential to enable mass prescreening."

And they conclude: "Our developed thermal imaging prediction models, based on advanced [machine learning] technology, have exhibited promising potential compared with the current conventional clinical tools.

"Further investigations incorporating larger sample sizes and diverse patient populations are needed to validate the external validity and generalisability of the current findings."

Japanese researchers reveal that diets rich in pulses and vegetables may help reduce stress levels—not just through nutrients, but by supporting the growth of specific gut bacteria.

Research: The intake of pulses and vegetables is associated with an increase in the Lachnospira abundance and a decrease in stress: Analysis of the ‘Sukoyaka Health Survey'. Image Credit: Santhosh Varghese / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Clinical Nutrition ESPEN, researchers investigated the relationship between diet quality, stress, and gut microbiota. Humans are exposed to stressors daily, and prolonged exposure can have a negative impact on both the body and mind. Besides, it can result in migraines, neurosis, stomach ulcers, anxiety, and depression. The gut microbiota has been linked to stress, with studies suggesting that stress can alter the composition of the gut microbiota and that the gut microbiota, in turn, can influence stress responses.

Furthermore, epidemiological studies suggest that diet plays a crucial role in stress, with various foods and nutrients affecting stress levels. Nutrient profiling is the science of ranking or classifying foods based on their nutritional value to promote health and prevent disease. Nutrient profile models (NPMs) serve as comprehensive assessment indices that consider multiple nutrients simultaneously, rather than focusing on a single one.

Various NPMs have been developed to evaluate diet quality. One such NPM is the Nutrient-Rich Food Index 9.3 (NRF9.3), which can be applied to individual foods, menus, meals, and entire diets. However, there are limited studies on the relationship between health indicators and NRF9.3. Moreover, prior to this research, no study has investigated the relationship between NRF2.3 and the gut microbiota or stress.

Foods acted as entry points: Natto, tomatoes, and green peppers were positioned as starting nodes in the network model, initiating the diet→microbiome→stress chain.

In the present study, researchers investigated the relationships between diet quality, stress, and gut microbiota. They used data from the Sukoyaka Health Survey of Japanese adults aged 20–80, conducted twice a year (in winter and summer). This study analyzed data from the summers of 2019 and 2020. The Brief Job Stress Questionnaire (BJSQ) assessed mental and physical stress response scores, and the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) assessed food and nutrient intake.

The gut microbiota composition was analyzed using shotgun metagenomics. NRF9.3 was used to determine the diet quality. NRF9.3 scores were computed using FFQ data, with higher scores indicating a diet rich in beneficial nutrients (e.g., minerals, dietary fiber, vitamins) and low in nutrients to be moderately consumed (e.g., saturated fat, sodium, added sugars).

Hierarchical clustering was used to stratify subjects based on their stress levels. The gut microbiota composition and diet quality were compared between the clusters. An exploratory probabilistic network modeling analysis was conducted to investigate the statistical associations and possible mediation pathways between gut microbiota, dietary factors, and stress response scores, while adjusting for age, body mass index, and blood pressure. The authors noted that other potential confounders, such as physical activity, socioeconomic status, and probiotic use, could not be adjusted for in this analysis.

Importantly, the study sample consisted of a majority of female participants, which may affect the generalizability of the results.

Age played a hidden role: Older participants showed stronger links between poor diet scores, altered gut bacteria, and higher blood pressure in the pathway analysis.

The study included 1,058 healthy adults aged 48.9, on average. The majority of participants were female, which may affect the generalizability of the results. Hierarchical clustering analysis identified three (optimal) clusters (1–3). Clusters 2 and 3 had significantly higher and lower stress response scores, respectively, representing high-stress and low-stress groups. Cluster 1 represented the medium-stress group. Further, cluster 2 had substantially lower NRF9.3 scores than other clusters, indicating poor diet quality.

Moreover, cluster 2 had significantly reduced intake of vegetables and pulses compared to other clusters. The researchers further investigated specific food items in the FFQ and estimated individual food intake within nine vegetable- and four pulse-based foods. They found that cluster 2 had significantly lower intake of green peppers, tomatoes, and natto than the other clusters.

Cluster 2 also showed significantly reduced relative abundances of Ruminococcus and Lachnospira compared to Cluster 3, and Collinsella compared to Cluster 1. The researchers found a statistically supported mediation pathway: a relationship between NRF9.3 and Lachnospira, as well as between Lachnospira and stress response scores, but not a direct effect of NRF9.3 on stress scores. There was also a significant relationship between the amounts of green peppers, natto, and tomatoes consumed and NRF9.3.

Notably, while natto is a traditional Japanese food, the authors contextualize their findings by stating that similar bioactive components can be found in globally consumed fermented foods such as tempeh or kimchi.

Stress clusters showed unexpected health patterns: The high-stress group had significantly lower blood pressure than the low-stress cluster—a counterintuitive finding suggesting complex physiological stress adaptations.

Taken together, a higher NRF9.3 score was associated with increased relative abundance of Lachnospira and reduced physical and mental stress response scores. Increased Lachnospira abundance was also associated with lower stress response. The relationship between diet quality and stress appears to be mediated via Lachnospira, rather than being a direct effect of diet on stress. Furthermore, increased consumption of green peppers, natto, and tomatoes was associated with higher NRF9.3 scores and Lachnospira abundance, which, in turn, were associated with reduced stress response scores.

The study's limitations include the self-reported nature of eating habits and dietary intake, possible selection bias related to a health-conscious, predominantly female Japanese sample, poor generalizability to other populations, limited adjustments for confounders, and the use of a subjective assessment of stress (BJSQ) rather than objective biomarkers. The cross-sectional design also prevents any inference of causality between diet, gut microbiota, and stress. Additional longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether specific dietary components affect the stress response by modulating gut microbiota.

The authors note that while natto, tomatoes, and green peppers were identified in this Japanese cohort, similar bioactive components are present in other globally consumed foods, and broader dietary patterns rich in polyphenols, dietary fiber, and fermented foods may also be relevant to stress regulation.

A new study has found that older adults living with obesity can feel judged or dismissed by care providers due to their weight, leading to a reluctance to seek help.

Conducted by researchers from Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) and the University of West London, the qualitative study involved in-depth interviews with 33 older adults and has been published in the journal PLOS One.

The participants shared their experiences and needs related to formal and informal social care, and the report highlighted the hidden care gaps caused by obesity.

As well as not asking for help because of concerns over how others might view them, some participants talked about physical barriers, with standard care equipment and facilities often failing to accommodate individuals with higher body weights, resulting in inadequate support.​

The combination of physical limitations and societal stigma also contributed to feelings of isolation and decreased self-worth among participants.​ Financial hardship was also cited as an unmet need, with one interviewee having lost his full-time job due to pain caused by his obesity.

Participants with higher obesity levels reported unmet needs primarily linked to emotional distress, including stress, frustration, social discrimination, isolation, feeling like a burden, lack of housing adaptations and safety, boredom, inability to continue hobbies, and limited access to support.

The study also sets out a new framework designed to understand unmet care needs of older adults with obesity. By identifying these care gaps, it could help care providers plan better health and social care and find where inexpensive, preventive measures could be most effective.

According to the latest Health Survey for England, published in September, 36% of adults aged 55 to 64, and 35% of adults aged 64 to 74, were living with obesity in 2022.

The study underscores the necessity for a more inclusive approach to social care, one that recognises and addresses the specific barriers faced by older adults with obesity.​

Older adults with obesity face unique challenges in accessing and receiving appropriate social care. Despite growing concerns over obesity's impact on health, its influence on social care needs among this demographic remains underexplored.

The hidden challenges faced by these individuals often go unrecognised, leading to unmet need and increased vulnerability. As the population ages and obesity rates continue to rise, it is imperative that our social care systems adapt to meet these evolving needs.

Our research makes clear the need for increased awareness among healthcare professionals to better support older adults with obesity, with policy reforms, training programmes that address weight bias and the development of care plans that address the specific barriers faced by this group."

Qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup continues this weekend with a number of UEFA games, including this one on Friday between Norway and Italy.

Norway currently leads Group I, putting it in position to qualify directly to the World Cup, though there's a lot of time still left to go. Italy has yet to play a Group I match.

Norway opened Group I play with a 5-0 win over Moldova, with Julian Ryerson scoring just five minutes into the match. The team never looked back. In its second game, things were closer, but the team still came away with a 4-2 win over Israel.

The Norwegian team has won four matches in a row overall, last losing to Austria in October in Nations League play.

The last time Norway qualified for the World Cup was back in 1998, but the team also has rarely had a player like Erling Haaland, who is the all-time leading goal scorer for the team despite only beginning his national team career in 2019.

Italy didn't begin its campaign until now, as it was in the UEFA Nations League quarterfinals. It lost on penalty kicks to Germany in that round.

The once-great Italian national team has failed to qualify for the past two World Cups. Can the Italians get a big win on Friday to jump-start their journey to the biggest stage in the world?

Inter Miami CF get the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup underway when meeting Egyptian powerhouse Al Ahly on Saturday, June 14 at Hard Rock Stadium.

In Group A action, the Herons will also face FC Porto (Portugal) on June 19 at Atlanta United's Mercedes-Benz Stadium before returning to Hard Rock Stadium and encountering Palmeiras (Brazil) on June 23. The top two teams per group reach the knockout phase.

This summer's expanded Club World Cup features 32 teams from six confederations vying for silverware and portions of the unprecedented $1 billion prize pool. The final is set for July 13 at MetLife Stadium.

How they qualified: 2020-21 CAF Champions League winners

Al Ahly are the most successful club team in African history, winning the CAF Champions League 12 times. That includes four titles from 2020-24, as well as a run to the 2025 semifinals.

Naturally, the Cairo-based outfit have dominated their domestic league as well. They're fresh off a third straight Egyptian Premier League title, giving them a record 45 overall.

Spanish manager José Riveiro oversees Al Ahly, who recently signed Egyptian international forward Trézéguet. He'll look to link up with compatriot Emam Ashour in the final third.

While Al Ahly don't have a global star, they're certainly capable of beating Miami and shouldn't be trifled with.

How they qualified: Host country spot

Inter Miami's Club World Cup debut arrives after winning the 2024 Supporters' Shield with a league-record 74 points (2.18 ppg).

This offers a fitting stage for their global-minded, ambitious project that sprinted into action in July 2023 when Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba joined the club. Then last year, Luis Suárez arrived to make it a "Core Four" of FC Barcelona legends in South Florida.

The Herons now hope to go on a deep Club World Cup run, boosted by a 2W-0L-1D uptick in their last three league games and Messi producing 7g/4a in seven games across May to be named the MLS Player of the Month.

Can head coach Javier Mascherano's side start strong in Group A? It likely hinges on their balance between defense and Messi's brilliance.

Patrick Agyemang was playing Division III college soccer the last time the U.S. men's national team sent anything resembling a first-choice squad to the Concacaf Gold Cup.

It was the summer of 2019, and Agyemang was about to enter his second season at tiny Eastern Connecticut State University, a 30-minute drive from his hometown of East Hartford. His goal of becoming a professional soccer player — let alone a legitimate candidate for the USMNT's 2026 World Cup squad — was a distant dream for the then-19-year-old striker.

"Obviously, I had doubts," Agyemang told FOX Sports in a recent phone interview. "I've always had the utmost confidence in myself. But I wasn't sure. I'm playing D-III, and all I really knew was guys get drafted from Division I. Where I'm from, not many people make it in this game."

Jump forward five years, and Agyemang is about to come full-circle. On Saturday in East Hartford, he'll likely take the field as the U.S.'s starting striker in the Americans' pre-Gold Cup friendly against Türkiye. With top forwards Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi unavailable because of injury, Agyemang figures to log big minutes in the national team's final tournament before the main event next summer. A strong showing would go a long way toward sticking around for the World Cup.

And there's no reason to think Agyemang won't have one. A towering center forward at 6-foot-4, he has succeeded at every level he's played at so far. His stellar two seasons at ECSU got him a transfer to D-I school Rhode Island. In December 2022, expansion team Charlotte FC picked him 12th overall in the MLS SuperDraft.

This winter, he earned a January camp invitation to the USMNT on the strength of his breakout 2024 MLS season, during which he had 10 goals. He then scored in January exhibitions against Venezuela and Costa Rica, which earned him a roster spot for the Nations League finals in March.

Playing alongside first-teamers like Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, Agyemang had the Americans' only goal in a 2-1 loss to Canada in the third-place game. Over what was a disastrous weekend for Mauricio Pochettino's team, the play of Agyemang and Diego Luna — who helped set up Agyemang's strike — was the lone silver lining.

"I think the confidence in him has grown," Luna said this week of his fellow USMNT newcomer.

"Just to feel like you're able to compete and play with these guys and contribute with a goal — it's a good feeling," Agyemang said. He's carried that self-belief into this camp.

"You look at a forward and you can tell when they're confident; they start taking their chances a little bit better," U.S. defender Walker Zimmerman said following Tuesday's training session in Chicago. "They're more energized to make those extra runs on both sides of the ball. And that's what he's doing right now."

Still, Agyemang has plenty of room to improve. Pochettino described him as "raw" in January. Privately, the Argentine has encouraged him to be cleaner on the ball, though Poch is clearly happy with his progress. He and assistant  Miguel D'Agostino even went to visit with Agyemang and veteran defender Tim Ream at Charlotte's training facility this spring.

"First touch, the first movement to get the separation between defenders — those are little things I'm definitely trying to learn," Agyemang said. "They want me to believe in myself, because they see potential to keep going."

After almost a year together in Charlotte, Ream has gotten to know Agyemang well off the field, too.

"He's got a personality," Ream said. "He's not quiet or shy, he has his opinions, but he's also a sponge.

"He's trying to constantly improve and be a better player in the locker room, in video sessions, constantly asking questions," continued Ream, a veteran of the English Premier League and the 2022 World Cup, where he played every minute of the Americans' four games. "That's kind of what propels you and helps you get to that next level."

Agyemang's performances for both the national team and The Crown are generating interest from European clubs. A move overseas seems inevitable at some point, before or after the World Cup.

But before that comes Saturday. Agyemang's parents and two older brothers have yet to see him play for the U.S. in person. They'll get that opportunity just steps away from where Patrick's unlikely journey began. 

"I've always dreamed of playing in that stadium," said Agyemang, who has asked U.S. Soccer for 25 tickets to Saturday's match. "That it can potentially happen this week is surreal."

The same can be said about his journey to this point.

"To see where I've come from, even two years ago, to where I am today, that development is crazy," Ageymang added. 

"I just want to keep going."

The Europa League winners have finally put their Australian head coach out of his misery - but who's the best man to replace him?

Ange Postecoglou has officially been relieved of his duties at Tottenham. That's a sentence most Spurs fans had been praying on for months as results and performances took a turn for the worse during a shambolic 2024-25 campaign.

However, victory over Manchester United in the Europa League final added some shades of grey to the situation, with Postecoglou having delivered on his promise to secure some silverware while earning a spot in next season's Champions League to boot. That that achievement came against the backdrop of a 17th-placed Premier League finish, though, has led to his time in north London being ended.

The Australian coach earned plenty of admirers for his attack-minded style of play in his first year at Spurs as he guided the team to a respectable fifth-placed finish in the league, but the drop-off over the past 12 months has, in the eyes of many, been unforgivable, and chairman Daniel Levy had little choice but to make a change.

In the end, Postecoglou's refusal to budge from his principles led to his downfall (along with a series of bizarre exchanges with supporters and the media). The question now is, who is the standout candidate for the job? GOAL ranks the main contenders below...

Manuel Akanji has broken ranks by openly criticising Manchester City's upcoming Club World Cup schedule.

Pep Guardiola's side have been drawn into Group G of the competition - alongside Juventus, Al-Ain and Wydad FC - which is set to kick-off next weekend, just three weeks after the Premier League season concluded.

If City go all the way in the tournament, they could find themselves playing until mid-July, giving players just a month off before the 2025-26 season starts.

For many players, these past couple of weeks have not provided them the opportunity to kick back and relax for the summer, as they have international football duties to attend to.

And Akanji, who is currently in the US on Switzerland duty for their upcoming pair of friendlies, has candidly spoken out against the fixture congestion.

The centre back said: 'I have been a strong critic of this competition for some time now. We players would love to have some holidays, and some time for our bodies to rest.'

Coming off their first trophy-less season under Guardiola since 2017, it is unsurprising that City's players are not keen to get right back onto the field after just a few weeks.

Akanji went on to explain that the rest of the squad are 'not exactly overjoyed' about the upcoming games, which come off the back of a 57-game campaign. 

The 29-year-old added: 'My City teammates are not exactly overjoyed about the tournament either. But it's now right in our faces, and there is nothing we can do about it.

'If we take part, then of course we want to win it. But if we reach the final, then the time period for us to recover ahead of the new season will become even shorter.'

When asked about City's underwhelming 2024-25 campaign, Akanji offered an optimistic verdict and argued it could have been 'far worse' than it turned out to be.

City finished third, earning them a spot in next season's Champions League competition, while they were dispatched in the FA Cup final by Crystal Palace, and knocked out of the EFL Cup and Champions League in the earlier rounds. 

'Set against the expectations we have, this hasn't been a good season,' Akanji continued. 'We finished third in the Premier League, three points behind Arsenal, and qualified for the Champions League.

'But it is still our worst campaign for some time. However, Pep Guardiola still said he was proud of us for never giving up. The season could have finished far worse than it did.'

Teams are expected to take this year's Club World Cup more serious than ever before, considering the mammoth prize pool at stake.

The side that takes the trophy home will receive a windfall of $40m (£30m), while a team winning of their games could see them land up to $125m (£92m).

For reference, the winner of the Champions League earns around £120m, while the Premier League champions typically earn between £38m and £40m for finishing first.

From this year onwards, the Club World Cup will take place once every four years, the next rendition coming in 2029.

City have won the trophy once - back in 2023 - when it was an annual competition.

Former Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel is advising his fellow Nigerian Victor Osimhen to move to the Premier League this summer and turn down a lucrative move to Saudi side Al-Hilal.

Osimhen - described as being "world-class" by Jose Mourinho - is yet to agree terms with Al-Hilal, and is also being courted by Galatasaray, where he spent last season on loan. Chelsea and Manchester United have been heavily linked as well, with the Blues attempting to sign Osimhen on deadline day last summer.

 "I think Chelsea have decided to go in a different direction now," said Mikel, speaking to GIVEMESPORT ahead of the Club World Cup where he's working as a pundit for the tournament's exclusive global broadcaster DAZN.

"Liam Delap has now come in, but I have always said if Chelsea signed Osimhen, he'd come in and hit the ground running straight away. I hope this happens with Delap as well, and that his arrival brings the best out of Nicolas Jackson. I want to see a great partnership between both of them, pushing each other in training and on the field.

What I really want for Victor, is to see him in the Premier League. I want to see him play for Chelsea, his boyhood club. He grew up with Didier Drogba as his idol.

I would love to see him play at Stamford Bridge. And then there's Manchester United or maybe even Arsenal who could be in the market for him.

"Unsurprisingly, Victor is a guy in demand. He's not short of options this summer. I can tell you, Saudi Arabian clubs have been chasing him for a very long time. They made so many offers in previous windows, and yet he refused to go.

"I told him, 'You still have time to play in Saudi one day, so just stay in Europe for now and come to a top club like Chelsea!' I think the best thing for Victor right now is to fight for Premier League and Champions League titles. And then, maybe after three or four years, go to Saudi.

"It's hard to turn down the kind of money on offer there. You're talking about up to €50 million a season. That's crazy! It's life-changing money. But filling your trophy cabinet is equally important. As a top footballer, you want to finish your career knowing you won the biggest trophies. Let's see what happens. But of course, if Al-Hilal can convince him, we'll see Victor at the Club World Cup and that will be exciting."

 DAZN struck a $1 billion deal for the global broadcast rights to all 63 games of the inaugural Club World Cup, which starts on June 14 as Lionel Messi's Inter Miami take on Egyptian champions Al-Ahly at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium.

Should Osimhen join Al-Hilal, which is certainly not a given, he'll make his debut in a flagship fixture against Real Madrid. It will be the first game in charge of new Hilal boss Simone Inzaghi and Real coach Xabi Alonso, while Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dean Huijsen could be handed their Real debuts.

Chelsea, meanwhile, begin against Los Angeles FC in Atlanta in a match that will see French striker Olivier Giroud come up against his former club, while Manchester City open the tournament against Moroccan side Wydad in Philadelphia.

And newly-crowned Champions League winners PSG have the toughest opening fixture of all on paper as they face Atletico Madrid at the Rose Bowl Stadium in California.

 "When you look at all the fixtures, it's hard not to get excited," said Mikel. "I am over the moon to be involved with DAZN at such a massive tournament. DAZN are making some big moves in football, and the Club World Cup is going to be groundbreaking.

"I can't wait to see the PSG-Atletico game. What a job Luis Enrique has done, and Diego Simeone will relish trying to tactically outdo him. And all football fans want to see Lionel Messi on such a big stage.

"I am also looking forward to seeing some of the non-European teams, like Al-Ahly, Al-Hilal or Auckland City. I really hope we see a team, perhaps with slightly less of a global profile, that will just surprise everyone and set the tournament on fire.

 "And of course, there's Chelsea, who I believe can win the competition. It's a chance to get another new trophy having just won the Europa Conference League for the first time. And visually, what a trophy it is to get your hands on. You need a key to open it! It's truly one of a kind. Even the World Cup trophy doesn't have that.

"I would have loved to win this trophy. I think the players will be really incentivised and there is massive financial gain at stake for the clubs as well. Every single group-stage win earns clubs $2 million, and winning the tournament is worth $125m, and some of that money might go straight into the transfer window this summer."

 Chelsea come off the back of beating Real Betis 4-1 in Poland to win the Europa Conference League, and in doing so became the first ever club to win every piece of major domestic European silverware.

Now they stand a chance of being crowned the inaugural winners of the Club World Cup. The champion will also get a special gold badge which they can wear on their kit for four years until the 2029 edition of the tournament. Yet however Chelsea fare in America, Mikel believes securing Champions League football has already made Enzo Maresca's first season in charge a success.

"The season started well for Chelsea and I thought, 'OK, we're right up there!'," said Mikel, who made 372 appearances for Chelsea and won 11 trophies, including two Premier League titles and the 2012 Champions League. "But then we faded away over the festive period. I actually think that poor run was a much-needed welcome call.

"In my day, we knew the festive period was important because you could take a big step towards winning the Premier League. Chelsea's young squad just went off the boil and lost a bit of focus. All credit to them, though, because they recovered and finished in a Champions League spot and won the Europa Conference League. That means there is real confidence and momentum ahead of the Club World Cup."

 Mikel has been particularly impressed by fellow midfielder Moises Caicedo, who was named Chelsea's Player of the Season after starting all 38 Premier League games this season. Caicedo made 114 tackles, 49 interceptions, 53 clearances, 229 recoveries and won 236 duels. And the Ecuador international even scored in the Europa Conference League Final.

Chelsea have a competitive midfield with Caicedo, Romeo Lavia and Enzo Fernandez competing for spots alongside Cole Palmer. Reece James has also been used in the centre of the park, while Dario Essugo will also join this summer from Sporting and Mathis Amogou has also been part of several match-day squads.

 "Peak Mikel in 2012 or 2013 would still get into this Chelsea midfield, despite the obvious quality they have," he said. "I'd pick myself over those guys. But all the midfielders' performances have been fantastic.

Caicedo is exceptional. He's grown into his position and plays with no fear. He breaks up play. He's very aggressive on the ball. You can see he's fighting for the shirt and for the club and wants to win games and trophies.

He looks like he could be captain of the football club one day, that's how highly I rate him right now. I just want to see him be even more vocal, leading with his voice not just his feet.

"I would also single out Enzo Fernandez. He didn't start the season well, but he finished it very strongly. He's started scoring goals, creating chances and is now one of Chelsea's main guys. And we all know Romeo Lavia when fit is outstanding. But I think there is still room for another box-to-box or ball-carrying midfielder, and Reece James is best as a right back in my opinion."

Although Caicedo won Chelsea's Player of the Season, Mikel has also singled out Marc Cucurella. The 26-year-old struggled initially following a £62 million switch from Brighton in August 2022, but has been a near automatic starter following an impressive Euro 2024 last summer as Spain beat England to win the trophy. Cucurella managed a career-high seven goals in a single season in 2024/25, with a particularly important header in Chelsea's 1-0 win over Manchester United in May keeping them on track for Champions League qualification.

 "There was this whole narrative around Chelsea being 'Cole Palmer FC', and what a signing he's been, but it's Marc Cucurella who has really impressed me this season, both defensively and offensively," said Mikel, who hosts the popular Obi One Podcast. "When he first joined I must admit I thought, 'Oh, what the hell is going on here?' But Chelsea were patient with him and that's paid off, and he now plays with such confidence and personality. Cucurella is getting better with every game and even chipping in with important goals. He seems like the kind of player that will love the challenge of winning the Club World Cup."

Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson will also be out to prove a point in America, especially now he faces competition from new £30m Chelsea forward Liam Delap. Jackson got 13 goals last season in all competitions, four less than in his first season at the club, albeit he played in 11 games less compared to 2023/24.

Jackson also came under criticism after being foolishly sent off in May's 2-0 loss at Newcastle for an elbow on Sven Botman. Mikel has previously questioned Jackson's ability as a natural finisher, but still feels the Senegal striker can become a top player for Chelsea.

"Nicolas has big potential and I never intended to disrespect him with previous comments," said Mikel, who scored six goals during his own time at Chelsea. "You can see there is a player there. He's good on the ball, quick and can run in behind. And he stretches defenders, which gives Cole Palmer more space. Now it's just about finishing more chances, and I actually think the competition with Delap will help him improve further. He needs to score more goals, and hopefully Delap's arrival with cause a positive reaction.

Christopher Nkunku should also be a source of goals, but to be honest I think his time at the club is now done. I genuinely think he needs to move on.

There was a lot of hype about him when he joined from Leipzig. I was so excited when he arrived, but his time at Chelsea hasn't panned out well.

"Injuries haven't helped and you can see he doesn't like being played out of position. He's not a striker, he's a number ten. But of course, when you have Palmer in that position, you can't just take him out the side. It's time to sell Nkunku, get some money and then invest in a wide attacker. I am not so sure replacing Nkunku with another striker is wise because it's not good to have three established strikers all fighting for one position."

 Unsurprisingly, Mikel is predicting Chelsea to win the Club World Cup and tipping Boca Junior as a dark horse to watch. He also expects Trent Alexander-Arnold to make a statement after joining Real Madrid from Liverpool for €10m, while Erling Haaland is Mikel's pick to claim the golden boot.

The Club World Cup promises drama and global match-ups never seen before, and it is likely one of the European heavyweights will end up lifting the trophy for the very first time and in doing so walk away with Champions League-type money earned over just four compelling weeks of football.

"Apart from Chelsea, I am actually most excited to see Boca Juniors play, and they have a great game against Bayern Munich in their group. Their fans are going to be incredible. I can't wait to see them inside the stadium and I hope they go really far.

 "Manchester City are a bit of an unpredictable team to judge at the moment. I think Haaland will end up top scorer and that should set up a good run for them. Pep Guardiola is trying to put things right after a disappointing season and this is his chance to get a trophy and sort of salvage things. Although an established side, Manchester City could be a bit of an unknown quantity because Kevin De Bruyne will likely have left, Jack Grealish isn't going to be in the squad and a few new faces should come in before their first game [against Wydad].

"As for Trent, he's going to want to make an instant impression on Xabi Alonso and his debut will draw global attention, so it's going to be special to cover that on DAZN. Obviously, Trent's been at Liverpool for almost 20 years, won everything and did so much for his boyhood club. I know many Liverpool fans will disagree with me, but I just think that now it's time to celebrate him, including what he's achieved at Anfield.

 "Let's let go of the negativity around his departure. Remember, it wasn't only Trent leaving, Liverpool also let his contract run down, and it wasn't an ideal situation. But it's time to move on, and Trent announcing himself as a Real Madrid player at the Club World Cup can help do that.

It's going to be a bit weird seeing him play in white instead of all red, but I do think he could be one of the players of the tournament.

"And then I obviously predict Chelsea to win the whole thing! I think we can all see now that the project is now heading in the right direction. All these talented young players are starting to gel together as a team, and they have a good manager that knows how to handle and improve them. I like Enzo Maresca a lot. He needs to stay at the football club. We are only a couple of players short of being able to really compete for all the top trophies, but I would still like to see a bit more experience added this summer.

"I want to see us take the Club World Cup seriously and win it. I want to see Chelsea's best players performing at this tournament because doing so would round off an amazing season. And you simply can't win this tournament without beating some outstanding teams along the way. So, if Chelsea can become the first-ever Club World Cup champions, it would be a huge boost heading into next season, when I think we might start to get back to the Chelsea I remember, that always competed for and won silverware with regularity. And to leave America with a new gold badge on the shirt would be a constant reminder to all these young players every time they put the shirt on, and for four years, that Chelsea is a club for serial winners and nothing less."

UNITED STATES MEN'S National Team head coach formally announced his 26-player roster for the 2025 Gold Cup that will open on June 15 in California. The Gold Cup team was almost entirely comprised from the players who were on the recent training camp roster along with the subsequent changes that were listed over the weekend.

But there were two notable exceptions. The first is that Sergino Dest was removed from the roster due to fitness issues that were determined during a physical evaluation. He was replaced by John Tolkin, who arrived in camp on Thursday.

“The technical, medical and high performance staffs have done a series of evaluations this week on all the players in camp, and in the case of Sergiño we determined the best decision is for the player to have an individualized training program for the summer so he can focus on being fully recovered and ready to perform next season,” Pochettino said.

Meanwhile, Pochettino added Walker Zimmerman, Nathan Harriel, and Paxten Aaronson in place of DeJuan Jones, Sean Zawadzki, and Folarin Balogun. Prior to that, Chris Brady replaced Patrick Schulte.

With that, here is the Gold Cup roster along with some thoughts.

 

GOALKEEPERS (4): Chris Brady (Chicago Fire; 0/0), Matt Freese (New York City FC; 0/0), Matt Turner (Crystal Palace/ENG; 51/0)  

DEFENDERS (9): Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew; 3/0), Alex Freeman (Orlando City; 0/0), Nathan Harriel (Philadelphia Union; 0/0), Mark McKenzie (Toulouse/FRA; 19/0), Tim Ream (Charlotte FC; 68/1), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace/ENG; 24/1), Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati; 32/3), John Tolkin (Holstein Kiel/GER; 4/0), Walker Zimmerman (Nashville SC; 43/3) 

MIDFIELDERS (9): Brenden Aaronson (Leeds United/ENG; 47/8); Tyler Adams (Bournemouth/ENG; 44/2), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps/CAN; 0/0), Johnny Cardoso (Real Betis/ESP; 18/0), Luca de la Torre (San Diego FC; 24/1), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake; 4/0), Jack McGlynn (Houston Dynamo; 4/1), Quinn Sullivan (Philadelphia Union; 0/0); Malik Tillman (PSV Eindhoven/NED; 17/0) 

FORWARDS (5): Paxten Aaronson (FC Utrecht/NED; 1/0), Patrick Agyemang (Charlotte FC; 4/3), Damion Downs (FC Köln/GER; 0/0), Brian White (Vancouver Whitecaps/CAN; 4/1), Haji Wright (Coventry City/ENG; 15/4) 

 

 

 

Many familiar faces from recent camps were left off this roster. Some were due to injuries, some were due to the Club World Cup, Christian Pulisic needed a break, and Yunus Musah withdrew due to personal reasons - but many were football decisions.

Some of those include Josh Sargent, Joe Scally, Cameron Carter-Vickers, Tanner Tessmann, Aidan Morris, Auston Trusty, Marlon Fossey, Alex Zendejas, and others.

Meanwhile, Pochettino has given a big opportunity for others to impress at this Gold Cup. If they take advantage, it could give them the inside track for being in the plans in the run-up to the World Cup.

Many of these faces would have been seen as extremely surprising as recently as the start of 2025. But players like Brian White, Sebastian Berhalter, Max Arfsten, Alex Freeman, Nathian Harriel, and Chris Brady have continued to do well and Pochettino wants to give them a chance.

That's completely fair. The U.S. team is coming off a year where it crashed out of the Copa America on home soil during the group stages and followed it up by a fourth place finish out of four teams at the Nations League (also on home soil) the bigger risk is to make few changes. The benefit for having a coach like Pochettino who comes in from the complete outside is that he sees things with fresh eyes.

When watching the Gold Cup, the right approach is to look at team as if there are very few locks. Before Pochettino arrived, most of the call-ups were assumed and this came regardless of club form. Now, it is more open and many of the newcomers over this past year are there not because of reputation but because they are playing well.

We will now see if that hunger carries over into the national team.

 

 

Aside from Chris Richards, who had a very good season for Crystal Palace, the rest of the team's central defenders all have serious questions and there is no clear pecking order.

Tim Ream is 37 and is always battling the age issue. Mark McKenzie had a good season overall in France but stumbled down the stretch. Miles Robinson has been good but unspectacular for FC Cincinnati. Walker Zimmerman now reenters the equation and is among the more consistent players but has only recently returned from a concussion.

Richards is a lock, but it is an open audition for the other four centerbacks.

 

 

No one questions that Antonee Robinson is the team's best left back. But who backs up Robinson has been an open question for years. While Ream can play left back, he seems like an unlikely option there outside of an emergency.

That leaves Max Arfsten and John Tolkin. Arfsten has been on the team all camp while Tolkin only was added when Dest was forced to withdraw. Both players should get opportunities over the coming month but Arfsten has the value having worked with Pochettino in January and March. Another good camp could put him in the drivers' seat to back up Robinson moving forward. It's there for the taking.

As for Tolkin, he showed well in the Bundesliga but after Holstein Kiel's relegation, he has to shift down to the 2.Bundesliga unless he gets sold (which didn't sound likely based on his media call in May). But he is a good player and has played a lot of soccer over the past three and a half years. He's still very much in the race.

FREEMAN CALLED UP BY THE @USMNT FOR THE 2025 @GOLDCUP ???????? https://t.co/0TEFiUDHlk pic.twitter.com/rXHKUmFH01





Right back becomes even more interesting. Dest hasn't played with the national team since March 2024 due to his ACL surgery and recovery. Joe Scally wasn't called up and DeJuan Jones had to withdraw due to an injury when he was replaced by Nathan Harriel – who hasn't even always been the starter for the Union at right back due to the emergency of Frankie Westfield – who is with the U.S. U-20 team.

That leaves us with Alex Freeman. The Orlando City homegrown has impressed this season to the point where he's one of the top young American players in MLS at age 20. Freeman (who is the son of former NFL great Antonio Freeman) is extremely athletic and fits the profile of a modern fullback. Despite only being in his first season as an Orlando starter, he is now heading into the Gold Cup where he will play a lot of minutes and perhaps even be the team's starter. He on a very accelerated push in his development. It is reminiscent of when DeAndre Yedlin forced his way on the 2014 World Cup team. Like Yedlin, big European suitors could soon follow (but whether he wants to risk losing playing time in a World Cup year is another question).

 

 

The central midfield of this Gold Cup roster has a lot of interesting names including Sebastian Berhalter, Jack McGlynn, and Luca de la Torre. It's important to note that Weston McKennie and Yunus Musah would be here in normal circumstances, so it remains unclear how many spots are up for grabs (although it doesn't seem like Musah is a lock right now given his second half of the season). But these players are all here over players such as Tanner Tessmann, Aidan Morris, and Gianluca Busio. That means there is likely at least one opening if they play well this month.

Berhalter has taken his game to another level in 2025 and that has seen him rewarded with a call-up. Despite being suspended for the final, Berhalter was critical in helping the Caps advance to the CONCACAF Champions Cup final and he is also a big factor in their first place standing. The concern is that he has not been playing at a very high level for a long period of time. He must show that his form the past three months is not a blip.

De la Torre has been out of the team for almost a year after dealing with injuries and a lack of playing time at Celta Vigo. Now on loan with San Diego FC, he is in good form and is playing regularly again. He offers a lot to this team in that he brings experience, quality, and the benefit of not having been part of the team's recent problems.

While Pochettino made several changes to the USMNT midfield from March, McGlynn remains on the team. His January camp along with a decent shift off the bench in the loss to Panama helped his case, but by no means is he a lock. He needs to play well.

 

 

Without Tim Weah, Christian Pulisic, or even Alex Zendejas on this roster, the U.S. team is short on players who attack from wide positions. Players like Diego Luna, Malik Tillman, or either Aaronson brother can play outside as a second position, but that isn't a strength of this team. And all those players could bring a lot to the team if they could also thrive on the wings.

Haji Wright plays on the wing a lot for Coventry, but he frequently tries to cut inside. Wright is just one of the many players who has been around the team for years but who shouldn't be considered a lock anymore. There is pressure on him to produce.

Quinn Sullivan is more comfortable playing outside than most players on this roster. He arrives in camp in the middle of another strong season for Philadelphia and he has an opportunity in the month ahead that could be surprisingly significant in his hopes of being with the team moving forward.

Attacking midfield is very interesting because Gio Reyna is not on the team due to the Club World Cup (although it is not a given he would have made it anyway given his lack of minutes).

Diego Luna is in a great position now given his contributions this year which is reflected by the complements from Pochettino.

Malik Tillman is coming off a great season but is under some pressure given that he has never seen his club form translate over to the national team and that needs to happen soon.

The Aaronson brothers are also key to watch. Brenden was left off the USMNT roster in March and that might have been a blessing in disguise as he was 6000 miles removed from the disaster that unfolded. But it also showed that Pochettino is hesitant with him. He has been a regular for a long time and he had a good season where he played a lot to help Leeds earn promotion. But his grip on a roster spot is tenuous and he has a lot to lose with a bad camp.

Meanwhile Paxten has been involved with the USMNT before, but this is different. Now he is no longer seen as a future prospect, but rather he is a player who is more ready to be able to contribute now. This past season, he was on loan to FC Utrecht and emerged as one of the top young players in the Eredivisie. His parent club, Eintracht Frankfurt, is looking forward to his return as they prepare for the Champions League.

 

 

Ricardo Pepi is injured and Folarin Balogun had to withdraw from this past USMNT camp due to injury. Pepi made a great impression with the team under Pochettino in the fall and likely remains in good standing. Balogun is different because he's not in a great position with his club and might have lost his starting position heading into next year.

Josh Sargent, meanwhile, was left off this roster due to Pochettino's decision. Sargent didn't impress in two camps under Pochettino and hasn't scored for the national team since 2019. Despite being named to the Championship team of the season, he has work to do to get back in the squad. He's in the mix, but on the outside of the bubble.

That leaves us with three center forwards on this roster.

Patrick Agyemang and Brian White have been involved in both camps in 2025. Even if all options are healthy, there are likely open roster spots for Agyemang and White – who are both very different. White is a close-range finisher with impressive size while Agyemang is more mobile. A good month by either or both could make a World Cup spot theirs to lose.

Damion Downs is in a slightly different position than White or Agyemang. He's a forward but this is his first USMNT and his youth national team experience is also limited. He is behind others, but that doesn't mean he can't make up ground. He is coming off a very good season with Cologne where he scored 11 goals across all competitions and helped the team to promotion to the Bundesliga. That gives him a great stage heading into year before the World Cup. But there is also a longer-term play for him. At just 20 years old, this is important for him just to get involved in the program. He will be 24 in 2030 and 28 in 2034. Even if he doesn't make the 2026 World Cup team, he is an important prospect for the future.

 

 

Goalkeeping continues to be a big question mark for the team given that Matt Turner is still the No. 1 and has only rarely played in England over the past two seasons. He remains the USMNT starter because no one else has made a compelling case. But if he continues to be a backup at the club level, Turner is at risk every time he reports to USMNT duty. One bad camp could see him moving to a backup role there as well.

In recent camps, it appeared that Zack Steffen and Patrick Schulte were the ones pushing him. Both of those keepers had to withdraw due to injury. Will Matt Freese and Chris Brady push Turner? Perhaps. But Schulte and Steffen will continue to be in the picture over the next year.

The key takeaway is that if Turner doesn't perform for the team over the next month, the goalkeeping position will become chaotic.

Real Madrid are reportedly in the final stages of negations with Benfica to bring Álvaro Carreras to the Spanish capital. 

After signing zero players in the winter transfer window, Real Madrid are focused on building their defense this summer. The club already signed Dean Huijsen and Trent Alexander-Arnold, and now are closing in on a major left back reinforcement. 

MARCA report the Spanish giants are “finalizing the details” of Carreras's transfer from Benfica. Despite “arduous” negotiations, Real Madrid are reportedly confident they will have the fullback in a white shirt in time for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

The Spanish outlet revealed Real Madrid agreed to pay Carreras's €50 million ($57 million) release clause in full just to get the deal over the line. The 22-year-old, meanwhile, has “expressed his desire” to join Xabi Alonso's team and is “awaiting the transfer agreement” in Lisbon.

Carreras is coming off an impressive 2024–25 season for Benfica. The Spaniard made 50 appearances across all competitions for the Portuguese side and played a pivotal role in Benfica's second-place league finish, as well as their deep run in the Taça de Portugal.

Real Madrid are in desperate need of a young, talented defender like Carreras with this summer's FIFA Club World Cup just one week away. Ferland Mendy is expected to miss the entire tournament due to injury, leaving Fran García as the only natural left back in Alonso's squad.

Should Carreras indeed complete his move to Real Madrid, he will have almost an immediate opportunity to prove himself to the club's new manager against some of the best competition in world. He, along with Huijsen and Alexander-Arnold, would form an almost completely-revamped backline for Los Blancos after a season marred by defense struggles and injuries.

Travel Ban

The U.S. State Department has sought to justify a travel ban that leaves nationals from over a dozen countries at risk of being blocked from entering the United States for the FIFA World Cup or the Olympic Games, saying that addressing security concerns is “part of what it means to host an event.”

In a press briefing on Thursday afternoon, the State Department principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott was quizzed by journalists following the announcement of full bans for citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Partial restrictions have also been imposed on the entry of nationals from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.

While President Trump's executive order, signed on Wednesday, contains exemptions for nationals who would be entering the country as athletes for major sporting events, as well as support staff and immediate relatives of athletes or teams, there are no such assurances for fans.

Iran has already qualified for the men's World Cup in 2026, which will be co-hosted in the United States, Canada and Mexico, while Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba and Libya are among the teams with varying degrees of probability of qualifying for the tournament.

Haiti's ability to play in this summer's Concacaf Gold Cup appeared to be confirmed on Thursday, having initially been placed into doubt by the executive order. This is because the order made a specified exemption for the World Cup and Olympics, but added other events would be assessed as whether they are deemed sufficiently “major” by the Secretary of State Marco Rubio. On Thursday morning, the State Department did not answer directly when asked whether either the FIFA Club World Cup or the Gold Cup, both of which will be played in the U.S. this summer, are “major sporting events.”

A State Department spokesperson simply told The Athletic: “We are implementing the President's directive to secure U.S. borders and protect American communities and citizens.”

However, despite the executive order saying events would be adjudicated upon by the State Department, a White House spokesperson told The Athletic that both the Gold Cup and Club World Cup are deemed major events. This appears to pave the way for Haiti to compete in the Gold Cup and also enables nationals from the banned countries to compete in their club teams during the Club World Cup.

There was less reassuring news, however, for supporters of these nations.

During a news conference, Pigott said: “I think both people that are coming and Americans would hope that we can have confidence that when people come to the United States, when they come, that they are properly vetted.

“I think this goes to the exact same consideration. I think that this is part of what it means to host an event of this magnitude, to make sure that we have that confidence. Again, we're in constant communication with countries about ways that we can see the vetting process we need to see, to have that collaboration and make sure that we're having those security concerns addressed. This is part of what it means to host an event. I believe people coming from all around the world, Americans going to these events, would want to see actions like this. We take security concerns extremely seriously. We want people to be able to go to the World Cup and do so safely.”

Trump's executive order describes Iran as a “state sponsor of terrorism,” alleging that the state “regularly fails to cooperate with the United States Government in identifying security risks.” Venezuelan nationals are accused of overstaying their visas at a rate of just under 10 per cent when visiting the country on a short-term tourist or business visas, while Trump's order claimed that “hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden Administration.”

Exemptions are made for individuals, such as Iranian dual citizens who are traveling with a passport from a non-banned country. There will also be entry granted to Iranians on immigrant visas owing to ethnic or religious persecution in their home country.

Elsewhere, the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) wrote late on Wednesday to all national governing sporting bodies across the U.S. with regards to what the organization described as “an evolving policy environment.”

The USOPC email, seen by The Athletic, came amid fears among some sports that their support staff or coaches could be impacted by the travel ban and their travel affected.

The email stated: “Importantly, a carveout has been secured for athletes and essential support personnel.”

It described this is as critical protection that will allow Team USA athletes, coaches, and operational staff to continue international travel in support of elite sport competition and qualification.

...

INGLEWOOD, Calif. — After Thursday's stunning loss to Panama, the U.S. men's national team promised a response. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino assured fuming fans that a sleepy CONCACAF Nations League semifinal “didn't describe, or doesn't describe, how we are.” Players said they'd “look in the mirror” and “raise the bar.” And yet, in Sunday's third-place match against Canada, they did none of that.

They lost 2-1 to their northern neighbors, and deserved every last ounce of the defeat.

They managed one solitary shot on goal over the game's first 84 minutes.

In the face of criticism and doubts, they talked about how, “if we want to be praised, we have to give people something to praise us about,” as midfielder Tyler Adams said Saturday. Instead, they regressed, and further disillusioned their supporters, and inflamed doubts about their readiness for a World Cup on home soil next summer.

All involved promised that, after the 1-0 loss to Panama, Sunday's performance would be better. This Nations League consolation match would “be an important game to see how we react,” Pochettino said Saturday.

“Mentality obviously needs to change,” Adams said hours later.

“We're gonna come out with that fighting spirit,” Tim Weah added.

In the interim, they had one-on-one talks and a “beautiful meeting,” Weah said, in which Pochettino pleaded for “killer mentality” and more. The message, Weah said: “We have to want it. We have to want to be here 100%. We have to fight.”

But on Sunday, they floundered. For most of the first half, they didn't take the risks nor show the “aggression” they said they would. In a stadium that was once again nine-tenths empty at kickoff, they played dull soccer, and conceded a 27th-minute goal before they'd even taken a shot of their own.

Soon thereafter, Diego Luna tried to inject life into the USMNT, and into another snoozefest. Playing in his first competitive match for the national team, he started an attacking move from the right side of midfield, and, with a driving off-ball run, propelled it into the penalty box. It was the exact type of initiative that the U.S. lacked Thursday — and has often lacked under multiple managers.

"The desire and the hunger that he showed is what we want," Pochettino said postgame.

At the end of his run, Luna received a pass in stride. He poked a clever square ball to Patrick Agyemang, who equalized with a firm finish.

The two Major League Soccer attackers, two of five changes to the U.S. starting lineup, seemed to lift a lagging team back into the game.

Neither, though, could erase the mediocrity around them. Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, the team's two Italy-based stars, were quiet. Adams and Weah looked nothing like their typically active selves. The USMNT was once against stagnant. Why?

"I think we need to have every single person buy into exactly what we're doing and what we're trying to do," Adams said postgame. "It's just the little things ... duels, tackles, leaving your mark on the field, not being naive in certain moments, being a little bit more clever — all the details of the game that, I feel like, when I watch people play with their clubs, we do. And then when we come here, sometimes I think we forget a little bit what the games are gonna give us."

Not long after halftime, they receded again. They nearly conceded two penalties. (Canada head coach Jesse Marsch was red carded for protesting one of the no-calls.) Then, in the 59th minute, they conceded again. Jonathan David put Canada up 2-1.

And that's how it ended, just as a friendly between these two teams ended in September, with the U.S. beaten — and with all sorts of questions swirling about the talent, passion, ceiling and capabilities of these U.S. players.

It ended with Pochettino "disappointed," again, and reaching for reasons that the medium-term future, in 2026, could still be bright.

"I want to send the message to the fans: Don't be pessimistic," Pochettino said.

But he couldn't offer clear rationale for why they shouldn't be, other than: "In football, anything can happen."

And as he rose to depart his postgame press conference, he apologized to everyone present, saying that he felt "shame" after the two losses, and promising, again, that "next time" would be different.

Later, as Pochettino slumped in his shotgun seat on the team bus, Adams was asked whether he, like fans, is concerned one year out from the World Cup.

"I'm never concerned, man. It's football," he said. "You gotta show up in big moments, when the moments matter. We didn't show up in this window here. We've showed up in the past, in moments when we needed to."

FIFA Club World Cup

The 2025 Club World Cup, which is taking place in the United States, gets underway on June 14 and runs until July 13.

It is a revamped and bigger version of the old tournament, which was first played in 2000. Teams from six continents and 20 countries are competing, with all of them — some more realistically than others — aiming to be crowned club world champions in New Jersey in the middle of next month.

Here, The Athletic explains how the competition works, what the schedule is, the rules surrounding squad numbers and suspensions and much more.

There are 32 teams playing in the tournament. All six of FIFA's confederations are being represented, with 12 clubs from UEFA (Europe), six from CONMEBOL (South America), five from Concacaf (North America), four from AFC (Asia), four from CAF (Africa) and one from OFC (Oceania).

Brazil are the country with the most different clubs participating (four: Botafogo, Flamengo, Fluminense and Palmeiras), with the U.S. the only other nation providing more than two teams (three: Inter Miami, Los Angeles FC and Seattle Sounders).

For all of the groups and the full fixture list, click here.



The 32 teams have been split into eight groups of four, with every team playing the other three sides in their group once. Three points will be awarded for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss. The top two teams in each group (by total number of points) will advance to the knockout stage, and the bottom two will be eliminated.

If one or more teams are level at the end of the group stage, their finishing position will be determined by points obtained in the matches between the sides in question, not goal difference, like at the World Cup. If they still can't be separated after this then various other head-to-head; then group-wide tiebreakers will be applied, all the way down to the drawing of lots.

The knockout stage consists of a round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals and final. All these matches are one-off straight knockout ties, with the winner advancing and the loser being eliminated. If teams are level after normal time in any of these knockout matches, then an additional 30 minutes of extra time will be played, split over two halves. If there is still no winner, then a penalty shootout will determine who advances.

The 32-team, eight-groups-of-four system is the same that was used at the World Cup from 1998 to 2022. However, unlike at the World Cup, there will be no third-place play-off for the losing semi-finalists in the club version this summer.

Group stage: June 14-26
Round of 16: June 28-July 1
Quarter-finals: July 4-5
Semi-finals: July 8-9
Final: July 13

All dates shown are according to the schedule on U.S. Eastern Time



After the group stage, the 16 teams that have qualified will be split, with eight on each side of the draw (called a bracket). There will be four group winners and four runners-up in each half.

All eight of the ties in the round of 16 will see a winner play a second-placed team from another group. The winner of Group A plays the runner-up in Group B, and the winner of Group B plays the runner-up in Group A. It is the same with Groups C and D, Groups E and F and Groups G and H.

The eight winners of these ties will advance to the quarter-finals, where they will face a team on their side of the draw for a place in the semi-finals. The same applies in the last four, with the winners reaching the final.

In the group stage, teams from every confederation apart from UEFA have been kept apart and therefore will not meet.

Four of the eight groups contain two UEFA clubs, meaning that Paris Saint-Germain vs Atletico Madrid, Benfica vs Bayern Munich, Juventus vs Manchester City and Red Bull Salzburg vs Real Madrid are the only same-confederation clashes in the first round.

Once the knockout stage begins, teams can play an opponent from any confederation, including their own.

Not in the group stage, but in the knockout stage they can.

Teams are permitted to have up to 35 players in their squad at the start of the tournament (and must have a minimum of 26). At least three of the squad members must be goalkeepers.

However, given that standard player contracts in European club football run from July 1 to June 30, FIFA have inserted a mid-tournament registration window — June 27 to July 3 — in which teams may replace players whose deals have expired. They can also add up to two extra players during this period, meaning from the start of the knockout stage onwards, clubs may have up to 37 men in their squad. Overall, teams can make a maximum of six changes to their squad during this seven-day window.

Each team will be permitted 26 players in their matchday squad: 11 starters and 15 substitutes.

Teams will be allowed to make a maximum of five substitutions in each match, as well as a concussion replacement if necessary. If games go to extra time, then each side will be allowed to make up to six substitutions, regardless of how many they made in normal time.

If a player (or member of the coaching staff) receives a yellow card in two separate games up to and including the quarter-finals, they will not be allowed to participate in the next match. There is an amnesty at the semi-final stage. Yellows picked up in previous matches will be ignored, meaning someone can only miss the final if they receive a red card in the semi-final.

If an individual receives a red card (either a direct one or via two yellow cards), they will be banned from the next match, regardless of the stage of the tournament. If the offence is deemed serious enough by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee, they may be suspended for more than one game.

The next Club World Cup will take place in 2029; like the World Cup, it will be held every four years. The hosts of the next edition are yet to be decided.

FIFA's newly expanded Club World Cup kicks off in Miami on June 14, featuring some of soccer's biggest stars like Lionel Messi and greatest teams like Real Madrid. But the launch of the new-look tournament, staged in the United States, also comes with uncertainty over how it will be embraced in an already bloated calendar where soccer is played virtually year-round.

This is world governing body FIFA's big play to get a stronghold in the club game. Until now, club soccer's marquee events have been regional competitions such as the prestigious Champions League, which is organized by European soccer body UEFA.

FIFA hopes the four-yearly event will be to club soccer what the World Cup is to international soccer and establish itself as one of the biggest and wealthiest tournaments in sport.

But that is far from assured amid a backlash from players over fear of burnout and it is still unknown how much appetite there is among fans for another competition. 

Here is what to know about the Club World Cup.

Inter Miami plays Al Ahly at the Hard Rock Stadium in the opening game on June 14. The final is July 13 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

The Club World Cup has been expanded from seven teams to 32 and will emulate the men's and women's World Cups. Eight groups of four teams will play in a round robin mini league, with the top two advancing to a knockout stage, which runs from the round of 16 through to the final.




Staged in the United States, host cities include Atlanta, Cincinnati, Charlotte, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York/New Jersey, Orlando, Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington, D.C.




Some of Europe's biggest teams will take part, including Real Madrid, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Juventus, this year's Champions League winner Paris Saint-Germain and runner-up Inter Milan.

From South America, top Brazilian clubs Fluminense, Flamengo, Palmeiras and Botafogo — all recent winners of Copa Libertadores, South America's top clup competition — will participate, while River Plate and Boca Juniors will represent Argentina.

Inter Miami, Seattle Sounders and LAFC lead the U.S. charge. Mexico is represented by Monterrey and Pachuca, while top teams from Asia, Africa and the Oceana are also taking part.

Notable absentees include European giants Barcelona, Liverpool and Manchester United, who failed to meet FIFA's convoluted qualifying criteria based on winning continental titles like the Champions League over the previous four years and ranking points. Countries are also limited to two entrants unless they have more than two winners of continental titles.

Messi anyone? Arguably the greatest player of all time will get the chance to add to his trophy collection, though Inter Miami is considered a rank outsider to be crowned world champion.

Kylian Mbappé, Vinícius Júnior and Jude Bellingham are in Madrid's star-studded squad, while Manchester City has Erling Haaland and Ballon d'Or winner Rodri. Harry Kane, Lautaro Martínez, Ousmane Dembele and Champions League final player of the match Désiré Doué will also be there.

Cristiano Ronaldo is a question mark. His Saudi team Al Nassr failed to qualify, but he fueled speculation about a possible move to another club in a recent social media post, while FIFA President Gianni Infantino said the Portuguese star could end up playing in the Club World Cup because of a unique transfer window.

There will be Saudi involvement though in the form of Al-Hilal.

With a total prize fund of $1 billion, the winner of the Club World Cup could earn $125 million.

FIFA said in March that it had allocated $525 million in guaranteed fees for teams taking part. That ranges from $38.19 million to the top-ranked European team to $3.58 million for the representative from Oceania, Auckland City.

A further $475 million is earned by results in the 63 games, with $2 million paid for winning group stage games, $7.5 million for playing in the round of 16 and $40 million to the team that wins the final.

The old version of the Club World Cup, which was played yearly, was dominated by European teams in recent times. Only Brazilian team Corinthians broke Europe's winning run in 17 years. 

An expanded tournament will give more South American teams the chance to test themselves against their European counterparts.

Saudi Arabia has made a big push in recent years to become a player in global soccer and has attracted superstars like Ronaldo, Neymar and Karim Benzema to the oil-rich kingdom, as well as winning the right to stage the World Cup in 2034. This will be its first opportunity for it to make a statement in a major global tournament since that drive. 

Inter Miami has already announced itself to the world after luring Messi and Luis Suarez to MLS and can further enhance its reputation. 

For European giants Madrid and Manchester City, the Club World Cup could see them add some shine to what has been a disappointing season for both after relinquishing their titles.

Every game of the Club World Cup is streamed live on DAZN.

            Uzbekistan qualified for its debut soccer World Cup on Thursday night, becoming the first ever Central Asian country to make it to the sport's global showpiece.
    


            A 0-0 draw against the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi secured the White Wolves a top-two finish in Group A of Asian Qualifiers, and a ticket to the tournament next summer in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
    


            Uzbekistan goalkeeper Utkir Yusupov's six saves, including a last-second stop, guaranteed his team a priceless point, to proceed with one game of qualifying remaining.
    


            Fans celebrated the news across the soccer-obsessed nation, with people taking to the streets to cheer and march, with traditional music and songs.
    


            President Shavkat Mirziyoyev called qualification “a brilliant result, which will be written in golden letters in the annals of our national sport,” in a statement posted online. He added that the players had brought “a holiday gift” on the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha, widely observed in the majority-Muslim nation.
    


            The team's historic achievement is no major surprise to followers of Asian soccer, given the burgeoning talent among its squad. The side's talented 21-year-old center back Abdukodir Khusanov now plays for Manchester City, having signed for the English giants in January for a reported £33.6 million (about $45 million).
    


            Striker Eldor Shomurodov has played in Italy's top league since 2020, while promising forward Abbosbek Fayzullaev, currently at CSKA Moscow, was named Asia's Youth Player of the Year two years ago.
    


            The breakthrough is the fruit of incredible recent performance in all age groups for the nation of 36 million people, which became independent in 1991 after the dissolution of the USSR.
    


            Its trophy cabinet includes the Under-23 Asian Cup in 2018 and the Under-20 Asian Cup in 2023, as well as this year's Under-17 Asian Cup. The team – currently ranked 57th in the world – also qualified for the Olympic Games for the first time in 2024, claiming one of Asia's three berths.
    


            The 2026 World Cup will for the first time expand from 32 teams to 48 teams, giving each continent, including Asia, additional spots, though qualifying automatically – with a game to spare – suggests Uzbekistan would have made it even under the previous format.
    


            While soccer has long been beloved across the Central Asian region, that popularity has never been matched by international success at senior level. With qualification secured, Uzbekistan's fans can celebrate on home turf when they face Qatar in the final match of the round, in the capital Tashkent on Wednesday.
    


            Just hours after Uzbekistan's triumph, Jordan become the next Asian country to make history, securing its first ever trip to the World Cup, defeating Oman 3-0.
    


            Elsewhere in the region, Japan, Australia, Iran, and South Korea – all World Cup regulars – have also booked their places at next year's finals.

Over the weekend, the U.S. women's national team cruised to a 3-0 win over China on goals by Catarina Macario, Sam Coffey and captain Lindsey Heaps. The Americans out-shot their opponent 18-4, including 7-2 in shots on goal.

Highlights included goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce earning her second cap and second clean sheet for the senior squad, Kansas City Current captain Lo'eau LaBonta becoming the oldest player in USWNT history to earn her first cap at age 32, and Naomi Girma playing a full 90 minutes in her first U.S. match this calendar year.

The USWNT returns to the pitch Tuesday night in St. Louis when it faces Jamaica in another friendly to end this camp window. On Monday, manager Emma Hayes said to expect lineup changes.

"At this moment in time I'm interested in developing experiences for the individuals, but within a framework that we want our players to work towards," Hayes said. "Nothing has changed in terms of our objectives. There will be changes tomorrow and I'm taking this camp and next camp to do all of those things.

"The things we need to dial up in this next performance are one, things we'll work on in training and two, we'll work on in the classroom when we go back. And I look forward to seeing how our team achieves that, not just the starting group, but the group that comes in. Because I want to make sure that whether you start, whether you come into the game, it shouldn't alter our level. If anything, we should keep finding other levels in us."

Subs we could see may include giving first caps to Seattle Reign goalkeeper Claudia Dickey and defender Kerry Abello as Hayes looks to continue widening her talent pool ahead of the 2027 World Cup.

U23s split matches in Germany

The USWNT U23 squad recently played two games in Germany and split the results. Hayes was able to watch both matches and said she was pleased with the progress that age group is making as it pertains to the development of younger players that could positively impact the senior team in the future.

"Two tremendous games," Hayes said. "The exposures we got for our players playing a top German team that also had five overage players, I never once looked at that game and thought anybody was out of place there, which is a starting point.

"This is why Germany and England and Spain, on many levels, have taken leaps in the right direction. Because they've had a U23s program, and programming at U20s and U17s, that has been above the volume we've been doing in the U.S. So addressing that balance is critical for future success and these two games will, I think, be pivotal for the success of these players, whether they'll be eligible for [the 2027 World Cup, the 2028 Olympics and/or the 2031 World Cup]."

USWNT-USMNT joint camp?

While the USWNT prepares for a match in St. Louis, the USMNT is training about 300 miles north in Chicago as it readies itself for pre-Gold Cup friendlies against Turkiye (June 7) and Switzerland (June 10). 

It's not often that the two senior teams train at the same time. So Hayes was asked if she'd ever consider having a joint camp with the men's side and if anything could be gained from doing so. Hayes and USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino are close friends, and Pochettino has said in the past that his team can take inspiration from the USWNT's success as it prepares for the 2026 World Cup.

"To be honest with you, it's not on my radar," Hayes said, noting that the USWNT's schedule is mostly planned out between now and the 2027 World Cup and that it can be a tricky matrix to determine who and where and when the team is playing. 

However, with the U.S. Soccer National Training Center in Atlanta expected to open in spring 2026, those opportunities to train at the same time could very well "arise more organically," Hayes said.

"But of course, it has to be in line with where our games are and things like that," she added. "Yes is the bottom line, but not an easy answer to answer based on all [those] factors."

Catch Sportstar's highlights of the Ecuador vs Brazil FIFA World Cup 2026 CONMEBOL qualifier at the Banco Pichincha Monumental Stadium.

Brazil remains in fourth place with 22 points; it faces next third-placed Paraguay, which won 2–0 against Uruguay earlier. 

The 15th round of the FIFA World Cup 2026 CONMEBOL qualifiers is underway as teams from South America race towards booking a spot in football's biggest competition. 

Brazil, which is fourth with 22 points in 15 matches, remains a firm favourite to go through because the top six teams in the CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers secure direct qualification, while the seventh-place team enters the intercontinental playoffs.

It is just one of those underwhelming contests that make it a difficult watch for both fans and neutrals. The first-half had one clear-cut goalscoring chance but the second 45, had none.

It is not the best of starts for Carlo Ancelotti as Brazil manager, but with just one game in, it would be harsh to make any judgements.

Brazil will next play Paraguay on June 11, and Ecuador will take on Peru.

The referee blows his final whistle and the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier between Ecuador and Brazil finishes goalless and both teams will share a point. 

Estupinan drives forward and takes a shot at goal. However, he fails to keep his effort on target. 

Brazil sub: IN- Pereira OUT- Guimaraes

Six minutes added at the end of the second-half!

Ecuador sub: IN- Medina OUT- Angulo 

It has been an underwhelming contest, to say the least. Barring any last-minute surprises, nothing much to say about this match in terms of excitement. 

Brazil sub: IN- Santos OUT- Gerson 

Ecuador sub: IN- Rodriguez OUT - Yeboah 

Estupinan goes for a shot from distance and forces a save from Alisson, who does well to hold onto the ball and prevent a goal scoring chance from a rebound. 

A cutback from the left allows Casemiro to open the face of his boot and go for a shot from the edge of the box. Casemiro gets a good connection with the ball but Valle remains alert to get down quickly and make the save. 

Caicedo finds Estupinan on the left, and the latter wastes no time in sending a low cross at the near post. Angulo tries to reach the ball but loses the race to Alisson, who does well to anticipate the danger. 

A good spell of pressure from Brazil in and around the Ecuador box but the Selecao are not being able to find that final ball to create scoring opportunities. 

Brazil subs: IN- Martinelli, Cunha OUT - Estevao, Richarlison

A dangerous cross comes inside the Brazil box from the left but Casemiro is in a good position to intercept the danger and clear the ball away. 

We should see both managers making use of their substitutes as the match hits the hour mark and scores remain at 0-0. 

Ecuador has already made a half-time change bringing on Preciado in place of Minda. 

Vinicius Jr shows quick feet to keep the ball on the left goal line. He sends the ball to Guimaraes with a cutback, who goes for a first-time shot at goal. However, his effort is blocked as Ecuador gets the ball to safety. 

The tempo of the match has slowed down. Right now, it is mostly a midfield battle. 

Ecuador has yet again made a brighter start in the second half, as Brazil has mostly resorted to defending in the early minutes. 

Ecuador sub: IN- Preciado OUT- Minda

The match remains goalless as the second-half gets underway at the Banco Pichincha Monumental Stadium.

There is hardly much to say from this half. It has not been a bland half but nothing too exciting has been offered by either team. Vinicius Jr's chance in the 22nd minute, where his shot was saved by Valle, was the closest either team has come to finding the net.

Brazil's 18-year-old forward Estevao has been a bright presence in the forward with his direct runs in the final third, but the more experienced forwards like Vinicius Jr and Richarlison have not impressed in the first 45. 

Scores remain level at 0-0 as the referee blows the half-time whistle!

One minute added at the end of the first half!

With half-time nearing, it is difficult to pick a winner in this match. Both teams have shown positive signs in the final third. Better finishing will be the main agenda of both teams. 

Estupinan finds Yeboah with a cross from the left, but the latter's header is not on target. It was a difficult chance as the ball came at Yeboah with a fair amount of speed, which made it difficult for him to control the ball. 

Brazil is going forward with a lot more ease now than it was in the early minutes of the first-half. This time, Vinicius Jr makes a darting run from the left and tries to get past his marker Caicedo, but the midfielder shows his defensive skills by reading Vinicius' ploy and pokes the ball out for a corner.

Another positive run from Estevao as he makes his way inside the Ecuador box and tries to find a teammate in the middle with a low cross. But Hincapie does well to keep the youngster under pressure, whose cross is collected by the keeper. 

Estupinan swings a dangerous cross inside the Brazil box from a freekick. Alisson comes out to punch the ball but misses. There is a scramble at the backline as Brazil sends the ball out for a corner.

Yeboah tries his luck from an ambitious distance, but he needed something special to beat Alisson from such a long way out. The shot had power but it is a simple catch for the experienced Brazil keeper. 

Chance - Brazil's first proper chance, and it almost scores from it. Estevao does well to snatch the ball and weave his way through the Ecuador backline and send the ball to Richalison inside the box. The initial shot is blocked, but the rebound falls to Vinicius Jr, who goes for a shot himself. However, Valle is in a good position to make a crucial save. 

With the first 15 minutes played, it is Ecuador which has been the more attacking team. The Brazil defence has remained composed under pressure but its forwards have not offered much in the attacking third. 

Brazil's Gerson and Ecuador's Angulo are both down after a nasty clash of bodies. Both tried to get to the loose ball, which resulted in the clash. However, it does not look serious and they should both be able to continue after some medical attention. 

Angulo makes a dangerous run inside the Brazil box from the left and tries to find a teammate with a cutback but his pass is intercepted and the ball is cleared to safety. 

The game has a good attacking tempo in these early minutes. A positive approach from the home team Ecuador, which is showing that it is not afraid to take the game to the mighty Brazilians. 

ICYMI - Ecuador has had a late replacement between the nets. Valle replaces Galindez who had some issue during the pre-match warmup. 

Minda delivers a good cross inside the Brazil penalty area from a freekick, but the away team does well to deal with the pressure and clear the ball to safety. 

An ironic fact to note - Brazil, known for its iconic yellow coloured jersey, is actually playing in blue, being the away team. Home team Ecuador, meanwhile, sports a bright yellow-coloured jersey. They would surely like some of that Samba flair against the country known for introducing Joga Bonito in the footballing world. 

Early pressure from Brazil, as Richarlison goes for the press in the Ecuador half. However, the home team keeps its composure and soaks the pressure. 

The FIFA World Cup 2026 CONEMBOL qualifier between Ecuador and Brazil is underway at the Banco Pichincha Monumental Stadium.

A new era for the Selecao as Carlo Ancelotti takes charge of his first match as Brazil manager. 

​​

Ancelotti, who Real Madrid to several titles with Vinicius Jr. as a player, said that his unique ability to unsettle opposing defences made him a vital asset.

Casemiro returns to the Brazil squad after not playing in national colours for about a year. He was the captain of the Selecao in the 2022 World Cup, but was not favoured by former coach Dorival Jr. 

However, new head coach Carlo Ancelotti, who has managed Casemiro during his time in Real Madrid, still feels he has a lot to give in national colours. 

In terms of absentees for Brazil, apart for Neymar, Raphinha is a big miss as the forward is out injured. 

Brazil is set to play Ecuador in a FIFA World Cup 2026 CONMEBOL qualifier at the Banco Pichincha Monumental Stadium on Thursday (Friday, according to IST). 

Ecuador: Valle (GK); Ordonez, Pacho, Hincapie(C); Franco, Caicedo, Vite, Estupinan; Yeboah, Angulo, Minda

Brazil: Alisson(GK); Sandro, Ribeiro, Marquinhos(C), Vanderson; Gerson, Casemiro, Guimaraes; Vinicius Jr, Richarlison; Estevao

Ecuador will host Brazil in a FIFA World Cup 2026 CONMEBOL qualifier at the Banco Pichincha Monumental Stadium on Thursday (Friday according to IST).

Ecuador has been in good form in the World Cup 2026 qualifiers, winning seven out of the 14 matches it has played so far. Currently, it sits second in the table with 23 points from 14 games.

Brazil, on the other hand, has not had the best of campaigns till now going by its lofty standards. It has lost five matches till now and sits fourth in the table with 21 points.

However, the five-time World Cup champion ushers in a new era with Carlo Ancelotti at the helm, with the Italian preparing himself to take charge of his first match as Brazil manager.

Hello and welcome to Sportstar's live coverage of the Ecuador vs Brazil FIFA World Cup 2026 CONMEBOL qualifier at the Banco Pichincha Monumental Stadium.

Vincen Kompany is running thin on options in defense, so he's going to have to improvise this summer. 

Right after the international break, Bayern Munich gets set to embark upon their FIFA Club World Cup journey in the United States, with their first match set to take place on June 15th vs. Auckland City in Cincinatti, Ohio at the TQL Stadium. The group stage for the German Rekordmeister ends on the 24th in Charlotte, North Carolina against Benfica and it is expected that the reigning Bundesliga champions will progress to the knockout stages.

But nothing is a given, especially with the amount of injuries Bayern has to the squad.

Bayern head coach Vincent Kompany is really going to be short on central defenders for the tournament. Dayot Upamecano, Kim Min-jae, and Hiroki Ito are all still out injured, and Bayer Leverkusen are still demanding a high fee for Bayern to pay to have Jonathan Tah officially available from the start of the tournament as opposed to from July 1st onward. As things stand, Josip Stanišić is the only fit senior center-back available for Kompany.

Nonetheless, per information from tz's Philipp Kessler and Manuel Bonke (as per @iMiaSanMia), Kompany and his coaching staff is seriously considering the idea of having Leon Goretzka partner Stanišić in the center of defense from the start of the tournament. The Belgian manager really does not have many other options available, and while Goretzka might not be the most popular candidate to line up at the heart of the back line, he has played there before.

While Kompany has not used Goretzka at center back before, Thomas Tuchel did in the first round DFB-Pokal clash last season against SC Preußen Münster — a match where Bayern won 4-0, keeping a clean sheet. Goretzka also featured in the center of defense in the 0-0 draw vs. FC Copenhagen in the Champions League last season when Bayern had already clinched advancement to the knockout stages.

Academy player Tarek Buchmann would not be an option with how little football he has played over the past twelve months due to injury problems and one of the only other options would be trying Adam Aznou, a left-back by trade, at center-back, which is far more of a risk despite the youngster doing well for himself on loan at Real Valladolid.

Novak Djokovic faces World No 1 Jannik Sinner in the French Open semi-finals and for a spot in Sunday's title match against defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.

Djokovic, 38, is bidding to become the oldest male grand slam champion in the Open era and said there is “no bigger occasion” for him that taking on the World No 1 in a major semi-final at Roland Garros. 

The 24-time grand slam winner proved he can still compete with the best after outclassing third seed Alexander Zverev in the quarter-finals but Sinner, the reigning US Open and Australian Open champion, has beaten Djokovic in their last three meetings. 

Earlier, Alcaraz fought back after dropping the first set to Lorenzo Musetti to book his place in the final for a second successive year. The Spaniard had taken a crucial second-set tie-break before Musetti began to struggle physically, with the Italian losing eight straight games before withdrawing early in the fourth set. 

Follow live updates and scores from the French Open below:

Novak Djokovic pushes a forehand to the sideline from the centre of the court. He's starting to twinge in his leg but is giving this a real go. 

The point takes him to 15-30 and he unloads on a second serve to win his first break point of the match. 

Sinner serves to the forehand and Djokovic begins the rally in control. That doesn't last as Sinner forces him across the baseline. Sinner drills one down the line and saves the first break point. 

On the second attempt, Sinner hooks a shot into the net! 

Djokovic breaks Sinner's serve. Game on. 

Sinner strikes first with a superb backhand return of serve but Djokovic responds with a serve-and-volley. 

He needs a second attempt at an overhead smash to get the winner though which shows how quick and responsive Sinner is across the clay. 

An inside out forehand wins him another point before a whipped cross court winner puts him 40-15 up. 

He holds but now must break or else Sinner is taking the second set. 

Djokovic is trying but he's finding it difficult to inflict blows on Jannik Sinner. 

In truth he's just trying to hang in there with the Italian during his opponent's service games. 

He can't live up to it. A hold of serve to 15 puts Sinner on the brink of winning the second set too. 

Once again Novak Djokovic is drawn into a prolonged battle to hold his own serve. 

Slight margins such as the pace of his serve or the placement of a sliced backhand are going either for him or against him. 

Sinner pushes Djokovic so far behind the baseline that he can scoop a drop shot over the net. Djokovic comes flying forward but can't get there in time and the point goes to him. 

It sets up a break point rally which shows the task Djokovic faces. Sinner comes up to the net and plays a drop shot, Djokovic's attempted lob isn't good and Sinner knocks it back. Djokovic replys with a backhand but Sinner is already back to the baseline and fizzes his return over. Djokovic goes wide, Sinner breaks serve. 

Novak Djokovic hasn't had a break point against Jannik Sinner in their last two meetings and hasn't had one in this match either. 

He's 15-30 up in this game but Sinner pings down another venomous serve which Djokovic lofts over the back. 

Sinner then flies through the next two points. Almost without issue and holds. 

Things are tough for Djokovic out there. 

Not this time! A rally of thunderous backhands goes Sinners way after he checks a cross court shot and drills it straight instead. The ball lands on the line and the game goes back to deuce. 

Djokovic looks as though he's giving this game everything he has and forces Sinner long. 

At advantage, he comes up to the net and wins with an overhead volley. 

Great hold from the great man. 

Before this match began it was expected to be a close affair. 

Perhaps the biggest question was how a 38-year-old Novak Djokovic would cope against his younger opponent. 

The answer so far is well, but not well enough. Each player is good enough to take points from the other but the margins are slightly against the Serb. 

At 30-30, on his own serve, he scoops a forehand, barely knee high, into the tape and gifts up a break point opportunity. 

Djokovic then leaps into another forehand in the next rally and forces an error from Sinner to reach deuce. He yells in triumph and gets a reaction from the crowd. 

It may be what he needs. 

Sinner miscues a sliced backhand into the net and advantage goes to Djokovic. 

This match has ramped up in skill. 

Sinner serves out wide to Djokovic's forehand and the Serb sprints back into the middle of the baseline in anticipation for Sinner's hit which lands long. 

Djokovic is upping the pace of his returns, especially from the serves, in the hopes of rushing his opponent. 

The results are inconclusive yet. A backhand goes wide and another error puts Sinner into the lead at 30-15. 

But, a precise forehand drilled quickly down the line putd Djokovic back on level terms and there's a chance to force break points...

... Or is there? Sinner fires down two aggressive serves and goes on to hold. 

Djokovic holds to love, which will be welcome because he was doubling over between points in the last game. 

Djokovic hangs up another lob but Sinner has it covered, Djokovic goes wide. 

WHAT A POINT! Incredible rally! Djokovic goes for the drop shot, but Sinner caught it and made the angled volley! Djokovic sent Sinner chasing, forcing Sinner into another angled volley, but was there at the net! He stands and roars to the crowd. 

Deuce again - another incredible exchange. Djokovic is throwing everything he has at Sinner, but Sinner is replying by sending back so much pace, and he's not missing anything. It's incredible. Djokovic eventually misses. 

Sinner HOLDS with the forehand winner. An epic game, and still no break point for Djokovic. But that was the closest he had been.

In a rematch of last year's Olympic gold-medal final, Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini dismissed Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider to reach their second straight Roland Garros doubles final. They will face Anna Danilina and Aleksandra Krunic for the title on Sunday.

In a rematch of last summer's Olympic gold-medal final, Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini won again and returned to the Roland Garros women's doubles final.

Roland Garros: Draws | Scores

No. 2-seeded Italians Errani and Paolini reached the French Open doubles championship match for the second straight year after dismissing No. 4 seeds Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider 6-0, 6-1 on Friday.

"We did, I think, a perfect match," Errani said afterwards. "Didn't miss many balls today, and we played really good. ... They're for sure one of the best teams on clay right now and in the world. We [prepared] very good, I think."

Errani and Paolini needed to fight back from a set down to take the gold medal from Andreeva and Shnaider at last year's Paris Olympics -- which was also held at Roland Garros.

This time around, though, Errani and Paolini dominated play from the start, and they needed only 61 minutes to prevail on Court Simonne-Mathieu. The Italians now lead Andreeva/Shnaider 4-1 in the team head-to-head.

A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros)

"We played in the Olympics, we play in Doha, we played in Australia," Paolini said. "Many times. Every time it's tough, you know. It's tough playing with them mentally, also, because they're playing really well."

In Friday's match, though, Errani and Paolini never faced a break point. By contrast, Andreeva and Shnaider stared down 16 break points in the clash, and dropped serve six times.

The Italians will now try to go one better in Paris than they did last year. They fell to Coco Gauff and Katerina Siniakova in last year's Roland Garros women's doubles final.

Despite Errani and Paolini's proficiency on tour as a team over the last year -- they have won four WTA 1000 titles to go along with their gold medal -- they have not yet won a Grand Slam title as a duo.

In fact, Paolini is still seeking her first Grand Slam title in any discipline. Along with her Roland Garros doubles final, Paolini also reached two Slam finals in singles last year, but was unable to convert any of them into a title.

Errani, though, has a Career Grand Slam in women's doubles. The 38-year-old won all four majors alongside Roberta Vinci between 2012 and 2014.

Errani has also won two mixed doubles Slams with another Italian, Andrea Vavassori. The first came at last year's US Open. The second came yesterday, here in Paris.

Errani and Paolini will take on Anna Danilina of Kazakhstan and Aleksandra Krunic of Serbia in Sunday's final. In an all-unseeded semifinal, Danilina and Krunic outlasted Ulrikke Eikeri of Norway and Eri Hozumi of Japan 6-7(5), 6-3, 7-5.

Danilina and Krunic were down early breaks in both the second and third sets, but they battled back each time before prevailing in a 2-hour and 46-minute barnburner on Friday.

At 5-5, 30-30 in the third set, Danilina carved an overhead with so much spin that it left Eikeri chasing down the surprisingly short ball to no avail. Krunic polished off that game with a winning volley to break for 6-5. In the next game, another superb reflex volley by Krunic sent them into the final.

This is Danilina and Krunic's first event as a pairing since 2022. Technically, the team has now reached consecutive finals -- before this tournament, their most recent result together was a runner-up finish at 2022 Cleveland.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Nearly three years later, they picked up where they left off, and posted a huge upset in the quarterfinals by beating No. 1 seeds Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend.

Now Danilina and Krunic are back into another championship match, and it is Krunic's first trip into a Grand Slam final, in any discipline. The 32-year-old Serbian is a former Top 40 player in singles; she has won one WTA singles title (2018 's-Hertogenbosch) and reached the Round of 16 at the 2014 US Open.

Danilina has previous Grand Slam final experience, including a title. The 29-year-old won the 2023 US Open mixed doubles championship with Harri Heliovaara, and she was a women's doubles runner-up at the 2022 Australian Open partnering Beatriz Haddad Maia.

In a rematch of last year's Olympic gold-medal final, Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini dismissed Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider to reach their second straight Roland Garros doubles final. They will face Anna Danilina and Aleksandra Krunic for the title on Sunday.

Two of the most well-known players in women's tennis have made a surprising decision.

Naomi Osaka and Jessica Pegula are planning to tune-up for Wimbledon differently than usual.

They were both slated to play at the HSBC Championships, also known as the Queen's Club Championships. But that tournament announced that both players won't be participating this year.

Hoping to see @JPegula & @naomiosaka back on court soon ❤️🤍#HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/9itz6TUAxd

SI's Pat Benson writes, "The Queen's Club is located in London, England, and is considered to be the primary warmup for Wimbledon. However, there are other grass court tournaments players can jump into to prepare for the third Grand Slam of the season."

Osaka and Pegula both had disappointing French Open exits.

Osaka went out in the first round to Paula Badosa. Pegula fell in the fourth round to wild card Lois Boisson.

They'll both be looking for better performances at Wimbledon, and they'll be trying a different method of getting prepared than usual. We'll have to wait until early July to see how it all works out for them.

Tall, talented and unapologetically passionate, Stefanos Tsitsipas has become one of the most intriguing figures in modern tennis. With a fearless game and an even bolder personality, he's carved a path unlike any other on the ATP Tour.

The Greek star rose from junior prodigy to Grand Slam contender in just a few seasons, drawing attention not only for his shot-making flair but also for his philosophical musings and on-court fire. 

His performances have electrified crowds and sometimes sparked controversy. Beyond the tennis courts, his story is layered: family ties to tennis and a social media presence that's as unpredictable as his one-handed backhand.

Born on August 12, 1998, in Athens, Greece, Stefanos Tsitsipas is currently 26 years old. He turned professional in 2016 and quickly ascended the ATP rankings, becoming one of the most prominent figures in men's tennis.

Standing at 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 meters), Stefanos Tsitsipas combines his height with agility, making him a formidable opponent. His stature contributes to a powerful serve and an expansive reach, enhancing his all-court game.

Stefanos Tsitsipas and Spanish tennis star Paula Badosa have become one of the most followed couples on the professional tennis circuit. Their relationship began publicly in June 2023, when they posted a series of affectionate photos.

But the road hasn't been completely smooth. In May 2024, the couple reportedly separated, citing the demands of their respective careers and the constant travel that kept them apart. This sparked a wave of speculation and concern from fans.

Yet just weeks later, they were spotted together again in Monte Carlo, and both confirmed their reconciliation during press conferences. He referred to it as “a learning curve” and described her as someone who understands him deeply.

Born into a family immersed in tennis, Stefanos had no shortage of inspiration. His mother, Julia Apostoli, is a former WTA professional who represented the Soviet Union and later Greece. She reached a career-high singles ranking of No. 194 and played at Wimbledon, instilling discipline and love for the sport early on in his life.

His father, Apostolos Tsitsipas, is a Greek tennis coach who studied sports science at the University of Athens and took the lead in developing his game from childhood. He is the oldest of four siblings. His brother, Petros Tsitsipas, is also a tennis player, though primarily focused on doubles.

The Tsitsipas family often travels together, and their tight-knit bond has always been visible on tour. Despite the eventual coaching separation between father and son, the family remains close. Stefanos has often credited his parents for shaping not only his athletic skills but also his mindset and values.

For years, Apostolos Tsitsipas—Stefanos' father—was a constant figure in his coaching box, guiding him through juniors to the professional spotlight. However, as he matured, so did his need for tactical independence.

In early 2025, he made the tough and emotional decision to part ways with his father as coach, stating in interviews that he wanted “a father, not a coach” at that point in his career.

In a strategic move, he brought in Goran Ivanisevic, the former Wimbledon champion and ex-coach of Novak Djokovic, to help refine his game. Ivanisevic's arrival signaled a clear ambition to return to Grand Slam contention with fresh insights and elite experience.

Since joining forces, he has already shown improved consistency and mental resilience, which was evident in his 2025 title run in Dubai. The change also relieved some of the personal pressures that came with a family-coach dynamic.

He's one of the ATP's most fiery competitors, but Andrey Rublev's story goes beyond his thunderous forehand. The Moscow-born talent has carved out a space in tennis with a mix of intensity and raw emotion.

Raised in a family with sports roots, his journey from junior phenom to top-10 mainstay has been anything but predictable. With a coach who knows how to channel his passion, he's crafted a career full of highs—and a few meltdowns.

Off the court, glimpses into his private life reveal someone far more introspective than his on-court fire suggests. From rumored romances to his close bond with his mother, his world is rich with detail that goes well beyond the baseline.

Born on October 20, 1997, in Moscow, Russia, Andrey Rublev is 27 years old as of 2025. Since turning professional in 2014, he has steadily climbed the ATP rankings, reaching a career-high of World No. 5. His journey reflects a blend of youthful vigor and seasoned experience.

Andrey Rublev's physical attributes contribute significantly to his playing style. Standing at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 meters) and weighing approximately 165 pounds (75 kilograms), his height and athletic build provide him with a powerful serve and an aggressive baseline game.

Andrey Rublev has long kept his private life away from the spotlight, but subtle clues have begun to paint a clearer picture. For years, he's been romantically linked to Anastasija Homutova, a former Latvian tennis player.

The two met early in their tennis careers and were often seen supporting each other quietly, without the fanfare that usually follows celebrity relationships. In early 2025, rumors intensified after she changed her Instagram handle to @nastja.rubleva.

She further fueled speculation with a cryptic post referring to herself as “Mrs. Rubleva,” accompanied by photos of the couple together and a caption welcoming a “new chapter”.

Despite the hints, neither Rublev nor Homutova has made a formal announcement. The tennis world remains intrigued, but true to form, he continues to sidestep questions about his personal life.

Andrey Rublev didn't stumble into professional tennis; his path was paved by a family immersed in the world of sports. His mother, Marina Marenko, is a seasoned tennis coach who worked with prominent players at the Spartak Tennis Club in Moscow.

His father, Andrey Rublev Sr., comes from a different athletic background. A former professional boxer, he later transitioned into the restaurant business but passed down a strong competitive spirit to his son. 

The tennis connection doesn't end there. Rublev's half-sister, Anna Arina Marenko, was a promising tennis player herself, reaching a WTA career-high singles ranking of 411. Though she retired early from the sport, she remains closely involved in his journey, albeit from a distance.

Andrey Rublev's raw power on the court is shaped by a thoughtful coaching philosophy rooted in consistency, mental discipline, and strategic evolution. Since 2017, his primary coach has been Fernando Vicente, a former Spanish tennis pro and current ATP Coach of the Year nominee.

In April 2025, he made headlines by adding a new name to his team: Marat Safin. A former World No. 1 and Grand Slam champion, Safin brings a wealth of experience—and charisma—to Rublev's corner.

The announcement caught fans and analysts by surprise, especially since Safin has rarely taken coaching roles since his retirement. Rublev, who has long cited Safin as a childhood idol, expressed excitement at the new partnership.

The duo debuted together at the Monte Carlo Masters, with him stating that Safin's perspective on high-pressure matches could provide the mental edge he's been looking for. Whether the collaboration will translate to trophies remains to be seen, but it has certainly sparked renewed interest in his career arc.

Lorenzo Musetti's dream run at Roland Garros came to an end on Friday when he was forced to retire against defending champion Carlos Alcaraz due to an upper left leg injury.

Yet the 23-year-old Italian stands by his decision and, speaking after the semi-final clash, Musetti addressed the issue.

“I'm really sad and disappointed how it ended, but still a great match,” said Musetti. “I felt at the beginning of the third when I was serving, I started losing a little bit of strength on the left leg behind, and definitely was going worse and worse, so I decided to stop.

“I think it was the right decision to make, even if it was not what I wanted. Tomorrow I will do exams, and I will of course see and evaluate the situation.”

Musetti came out firing in his bid to reach his first Grand Slam final and took it to the defending champion across two tightly contested opening sets. But he was unable to continue, with Alcaraz leading 4-6, 7-6(3), 6-0, 2-0 when the Italian retired.
Having now lost each of the past three meetings with Alcaraz, all of which have come on clay this year, Musetti now trails 1-6 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. He is, however, able to draw on these matches to better understand where his game is compared to the No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings.
“I think we both started really, really well, hitting the ball really well. Of course I had to play probably my best level of the tournament to stay there with him,” Musetti said. “I felt today honestly I stepped forward on my level. I felt closer to his level.
“I maintained the high level that we showed for two hours or whatever. So [I'm] really, really happy about that. That's a step forward because the last two matches were a little bit one way. I felt that today I had my chances to even try to go two sets up, but of course Carlos, he's playing really well. He's in really great shape. He deserves to go to the final.”

Despite the bitter nature of his exit in Paris, Musetti can look back on a remarkable campaign on European clay. He became just the fifth player in history to reach the semi-finals at all clay ATP Masters 1000 events and Roland Garros in one season. Musetti departs Paris with a 19-4 record on clay this year, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.
Reflecting on his clash with Alcaraz, Musetti acknowledged the nature of the occasion.
“I knew even before stepping on court that I had to play probably the best match of my career so far,” said Musetti. “For part of it, I was doing a great job and I was there physically, technically, mentally. I think I was playing right. Sometimes he wanted to be really aggressive, especially on the return side, and I served really good today.
“At the end if I have to analyse those two sets, they were really, really great sets. Of course the third one and the last two games, there was of course no chance to play at his level with this problem. So it was an unlucky situation, but I think in the end he probably had more than me.”
Musetti, who will leave the French capital up one spot to a career-high No. 6 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, is able to look ahead with confidence approaching the grass-court swing. He tallied a Tour-leading 12 wins on the surface last year with runs to the semi-finals at Wimbledon and the championship match at Queen's Club.

The second grand slam of the year is ongoing at Roland-Garros. The 2025 French Open has reached the men's semifinals. Defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz has made it through to the semis. Defending champ Iga Swiatek was knocked out in her semis match by the top seed of the women's tournament, Aryna Sabalenka — who will face No. 2 Coco Gauff in the women's final this Saturday. In the U.S., coverage of this year's tournament is airing on TNT and truTV, and every match is streaming live on HBO Max.

Are you ready to watch the men's semis at the French Open? Here's how to follow all the action down on the clay courts at Roland-Garros.

Dates: May 25 - June 8

Time: Play starts daily at 5 a.m. ET

Location: Stade Roland-Garros

TV channel: TNT, truTV

Streaming: HBO Max

The 2025 French Open will take place between May 25 and June 8. Singles play begins May 25, with the men's final closing things out on June 8.

Thanks to the time difference between the U.S. and France, the tennis tournament at Roland-Garros will start daily play at 5 a.m. ET/3 a.m. PT.

In a shift from last year, the 2025 Roland-Garros tennis tournament will air across TNT and truTV — with all matches streaming on Max (soon to be officially re-named HBO Max).

Disney

The Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle gets you exactly what it sounds like: access to Disney+, Hulu and Max. If you go ad-free ($29.99/month) you'll save up to 38% off compared to individually paying for all three services — and gain access to all French Open coverage. 

If you don't already have access to these platforms, this is a great option that really covers your bases, streaming-wise. You'll get access to three vast libraries, fully stocked with everything MCU, all those Disney princesses (new and old), Hulu's robust catalog of shows on-demand the day after they air, including the latest episodes of Abbott Elementary, Grey's Anatomy and more, and the most recent seasons of The Last of Us, The Pitt and White Lotus.

 

While Sling doesn't offer a free trial these days, the tournament will last longer than any free trial anyway. With Sling Blue, you can get access to French Open coverage on TNT and truTV. 

Sling also has an option to bundle Max in with your Sling Orange + Blue subscription and save $5 on the overall price, in case you want to watch games via Max and take advantage of all the channels offered in the Sling Orange + Blue combo package. 

If you want to catch every match of the French Open and don't currently subscribe to HBO Max or a live TV streaming service, in Australia a majority of the action is streaming free with ads on 9Now, and in Austria it's all streaming free with ads on ServusTV.

Don't live in either of those places? Don't worry, you can still stream like you do with the help of a VPN. A VPN (virtual private network) helps protect your data, can mask your IP address and is perhaps most popular for being especially useful in the age of streaming. Whether you're looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to next F1 race without a cable package, a VPN can help you out. Looking to try a VPN for the first time? This guide breaks down the best VPN options for every kind of user.

 

ExpressVPN offers “internet without borders,” meaning you can tune into an Austrian or Australian livestream this month as opposed to paying for another streaming subscription. All you'll need to do is sign up for ExpressVPN, change your server location and then find free livestream coverage on 9Now or ServusTV. 

ExpressVPN's added protection, speed and range of location options make it an excellent choice for first-time VPN users looking to stretch their streaming abilities, plus, it's Engadget's top pick for the best streaming VPN. New users can save 61% when they sign up for ExpressVPN's 2-year subscription. Plus, the service offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, in case you're nervous about trying a VPN.

Carlos Alcaraz is back into the final at Roland Garros after Lorenzo Musetti was forced to retire from their semifinal match in the fourth set due to a leg injury.After dropping his fourth set of the tournament, Alcaraz was leading Musetti 4-6, 7-6(3), 6-0, 2-0 when the Italian ultimately could not continue after two hours, 25 minutes. A short while earlier, trailing 0-5 in the third set, Musetti called for the physio to receive treatment on his upper left leg, having first reached for it after landing awk"It's never great to get through or win the match like this," Alcaraz said afterwards. "Lorenzo is a great player; he has done an incredible clay season, he's one of the few players who achieved at least the semifinals in all the big events on clay. ... That shows what an incredible player he is. I just wish him all the best, soon recovery, and I'm sure we're going to enjoy his tennis again pretty soon."Musetti is the third man in the Open Era who has retired from a Roland Garros semifinal, following David Nalbandian in 2006 against Roger Federer and Alexander Zverev against Rafael Nadal in 2022.

Before Musetti's injury, Alcaraz said he was able to swing freer after capturing a see-saw second in which the players traded breaks twice. Alcaraz was the one ahead, first at 2-1 and again at 6-5, but found his best level in the tiebreak. He led 6-1 before converting on his fourth set point a while later."The first two sets were really tough.

Aiming to improve to 4-0 in Grand Slam finals, Alcaraz will face either world No. 1 Jannik Sinner or sixth-seeded Novak Djokovic, the 24-time Grand Slam winner, in the final.The Spaniard said the second semifinal would be must-see TV."For sure, I'm not going to miss it," he said. "This match-up is one of the best match-ups that we have in tennis right now; Sinner against Djokovic, it's going to be great tennis. As a huge fan of tennis, I'm going to watch it, I'm going to enjoy it, obviously I'm going to take tactics from that match, but we're all going to watch and enjoy it because I think they're going to play a great match."

Carlos Alcaraz benefited from the abandonment of Lorenzo Musetti (4-6, 7-6 (3), 6-0, 2-0) on Friday afternoon and will face the winner of the match between Italian Jannik Sinner, the top seed, and Serb Novak Djokovic, the No 6 seed, for the title

Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, the second seed, moved into the final of Roland-Garros when Italian Lorenzo Musetti, the No 8 seed, retired at Roland-Garros in Paris on Friday afternoon.

Alcaraz, ranked No 2, led 4-6, 7-6 (3), 6-0, 2-0 when Musetti, ranked No 7, pulled out on Friday at Roland-Garros in Paris.

The 22-year-old Spaniard will play the winner of the match between Italian Jannik Sinner, the top seed, and Serb Novak Djokovic, the No 6 seed, next.

Carlos Alcaraz won against Italian qualifier Giulio Zeppieri (6-3, 6-4, 6-2), Hungarian Fabian Marozsan (6-1, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2), Bosnian Damir Dzumhur (6-1, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4), American Ben Shelton, the No 13 seed (7-6 (8), 6-3, 4-6, 6-4) and American Tommy Paul, the No 12 seed (6-0, 6-1, 6-4) earlier in the tournament.

In the previous rounds of the Roland-Garros 2025, the Italian beat German qualifier Yannick Hanfmann (7-5, 6-2, 6-0), Colombian lucky loser Daniel Elahi Galan (6-4, 6-0, 6-4), Argentinian Mariano Navone (4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2), Dane Holger Rune, the No 10 seed (7-5, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2) and American Frances Tiafoe, the No 15 seed (6-2, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2).

            It's crunch time in Paris as we reach the business end of the French Open.
    


            World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka came through a battle against four-time winner and defending champion Iga Świątek to make the women's final where she will face American star Coco Gauff, who ended Lois Boisson's Cinderella story.
    


            Meanwhile, in the men's draw, Carlos Alcaraz defeated Italian star Lorenzo Musetti to make it to the final, while 24-time grand slam champion Novak Djokovic is set to clash with world No. 1 Jannik Sinner.
    


            We look set for another memorable weekend of action on the iconic red clay of Roland Garros.
    


            Here's everything you need to know about one of the world's oldest tennis tournaments:
    


            Starting out as the “French Clay-Court Championships” in 1891 – allowing only players from France to compete – the French Open was officially created in 1925 when foreign players were first invited.
    


            In 1927, a new arena was purpose built for France's defense of its 1927 Davis Cup title and named after Roland Garros – not a sportsman, but a pioneering French aviator who was killed in World War I.
    


            The French Open is one of tennis' four grand slam tournaments along with Wimbledon, the US Open and the Australian Open – and the only one played on clay.
    


            But are the courts really made of clay? The answer is not much.
    


            Clay makes up just a small part of the tennis court, with 1-2 millimeters of crushed red bricks giving them their famous red hue.
    


            Playing on clay is considerably different to playing on grass or hard courts.
    


            Clay is more physically demanding as it is the slowest of the three surfaces, producing longer rallies, more running and more shots.
    


            Grueling five-set matches on clay can push players close to their physical limits.

Roland Garros: Why is clay the most difficult surface to play on?



            Matches on clay are also sometimes referred to as chess matches, where a well-placed shot can set up a winner two or three shots later.
    


            Clay also has considerably more friction than grass or hard courts, allowing the ball to grip to the dust and bounce much higher, in particular shots with heavy topspin.
    


            Even for a player as accomplished as Novak Djokovic, one of the sport's all-time greats, clay continues to be a tricky surface to master.
    


            “It's a very demanding surface,” Djokovic said after recently winning his first clay court match since completing the “Golden Slam” at the Paris Olympics.
    


            “We all know how tricky it is to play on clay; compared to the other surfaces, you always have to expect an extra one or two shots, balls coming back.”
    


            While Roland Garros is considered the pinnacle of the clay season, there are many other ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) and WTA (Women's Tennis Association) tournaments played on the red dust.
    


            This year, there are 18 tournaments scheduled to be played on clay in the ATP Tour, while the women will play 11 clay court tournaments in 2025.
    


            But hard court is still the most popular surface on both tours in 2025. Hard court is also favored by US players as most of the American tournaments are played on that surface.
    


            While some smaller tournaments pay the male winner more than female players, all four grand slams offer equal prize money. The US Open was the first to award both tournament winners equal money in 1973 – something championed by Billie Jean King.
    


            The Australian Open followed suit 11 years later, offering men and women equal pay but reverted to paying men more in 1996. In 2001, they reversed course again and offered both men's and women's winners $440,000.
    


            Roland Garros implemented equal pay in 2006, and one year later Wimbledon committed to equal pay. Today, the four slams offer equal pay for each round of the draw.
    


            The last time Rafael Nadal – the most accomplished tennis player in history on clay – won the tournament was in 2023.
    


            In November 2024, the “King of Clay” played his final match of professional tennis when Spain lost in the Davis Cup. With 22 grand slams in his pocket – including a record 14 French Opens – we look at the new generation of tennis players who perform well on the red stuff.
    


            Will we ever see someone match Nadal's achievements on clay?
    


            What makes the French Open different to the other grand slams?
    


            With Paris being the fashion capital of the world, players have debuted some eye-catching outfits at Roland Garros.
    


            This year, Olympic gold medalist Zheng Qinwen modeled a unique calf-length pleated skirt – inspired by Suzanne Lenglen's iconic style – though she said she is “too shy” to wear it on the court.

            However, the most famous of all the Roland Garros outfits has to be Serena Williams' superhero-esque ‘catsuit' she wore in 2018 just months after giving birth to her first child.
    


            The glitz and glamor of the tournament also draws celebrities from all walks of life, with singer/producer/composer Pharrell Williams, actor Ben Stiller and three-time Formula One world drivers champion Jackie Stewart among those in attendance last year.
    


            The French Open crowd is also known for being among the most boisterous on the tennis calendar.
    


            The famous chant taken from the pasodoble “En Er Mundo” can be heard across Roland Garros throughout the tournament's two weeks.
    


            Somebody in the crowd will sing “Popopopopopopo pololoooo!” with the rest of the arena responding with an: “Olééé!”
    


            We are guaranteed to see a brand new winner of the women's title – who will see their name etched in history this weekend: Sabalenka or Gauff?
    


            In the men's draw, can Alcaraz become the first man to go back-to-back since his idol Nadal in 2020, will Sinner win his first French Open or will Djokovic further extend his grand slam record?

Here's a recent tennis story from the Associated Press:

PARIS (AP) — A crucial moment arrived more than 2 1/2 hours into Novak Djokovic's 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 French Open quarterfinal victory over Alexander Zverev. It was the fourth set, and Djokovic led, but Zverev was in possession of a break point and a chance to get back into Wednesday's match.

They engaged in a 41-stroke exchange, the longest of a buggy and breezy night, and Djokovic came out on top, smacking a forehand winner. He stayed in place afterward, breathing heavily, with hands on hips, scanning the standing ovation from thousands of Court Philippe-Chatrier spectators. He soon held serve for a 4-2 lead in that set and was back on track.

Djokovic might be 38 now. He might have slogged through a pair of three-match losing skids this season and slid to No. 6 in the rankings. What hasn't changed is Djokovic's determination or his ability to be his best on big stages — and now he's two wins from a record 25th Grand Slam title.

Djokovic proved too much for No. 3 seed Zverev, a man who's a decade younger and was last year's runner-up at Roland-Garros, and set up a semifinal against No. 1 Jannik Sinner.

Djokovic is pleased to show himself, and others, he's still got it

“I still push myself on a daily basis at this age because of these kind of matches and these kind of experiences,” Djokovic said. “It's a proven kind of testament to myself that I can — and to others that I can — still play on the highest level.”

Earlier Wednesday, Sinner continued his overpowering run through the bracket by dismissing Alexander Bublik 6-1, 7-5, 6-0. Sinner not only hasn't dropped a set so far, but he has ceded a total of only 36 games through five matches.

So Friday will bring a tantalizing showdown between someone many consider the top player in tennis history, Djokovic, and someone who is at the top of the men's game at the moment, Sinner. They are tied 4-4 head-to-head; Sinner won the last three matchups.

“He has shown now, in the last period, that he is back,” Sinner said.

Djokovic has 24 major titles, and Sinner has won 3 of the past 5

No one has spent more weeks at No. 1 in the rankings than Djokovic. No one has won more major championships or reached more major semifinals than his total that now stands at 51 after becoming the second-oldest man to get that far in Paris. He also just claimed his 100th career tournament title, a week before the French Open.

“I just hope that I will be able to physically keep up with Sinner in few days' time,” Djokovic said. “It's a big challenge for me.”

Sinner, 23, has won three of the past five Grand Slam titles. That includes last year's U.S. Open and this year's Australian Open.

“He's playing fast. He's playing smart,” Bublik said. “He's in another dimension with all the aspects of the game.”

Also an apt description for Djokovic, who repeatedly used drop shots to great effect against Zverev.

As for Sinner, no one other than Carlos Alcaraz has been able to beat him in his last 48 matches, a stretch that dates to last August. Sinner is 46-2 in that span, with both defeats coming against the French Open's defending champion.

And as it happens, No. 2 Alcaraz is still around. He will meet No. 8 Lorenzo Musetti in Friday's other semifinal.

Djokovic and Zverev were both bothered by bugs during their match

There were some distractions in Djokovic vs. Zverev, including a bunch of tiny flying insects that the players kept trying to swat away and a back-and-forth between the chair umpire and some fans in the fourth set.

Needless to say, Djokovic handled it all much better. He also was superior in pretty much every way with the ball in play.

He was broken in the very first game — and then not again.

He broke Zverev four times — no small feat against a guy broken a total of five times in his five previous matches.

“What do you want me to say? He's won 24 of these things,” Zverev said.

The last time these two played each other was in the Australian Open semifinals in January, and Djokovic had to quit after one set because of an injured hamstring. The last time Djokovic played at the French Open, 12 months ago, he had to withdraw before the quarterfinals because he tore the meniscus in his right knee and needed surgery.

He sure looks in good shape at the moment.

19:02 CET - We are just minutes away from the second French Open semi-final of the day between world No. 1 Jannik Sinner and 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic. Both players are now taking to the court, and it promises to be an absolute thriller!

Follow the match live here.

17:07 CET - Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz is back into the French Open final after Lorenzo Musetti retired from their semi-final, trailing 6-4, 6-7(3), 6-0, 2-0. The Italian appeared to be struggling with a thigh injury towards the end, and is unable to continue. His fine clay-court season comes to a disappointing close.

Meanwhile, Alcaraz now stands on the verge of a fifth Grand Slam title and his second here, but he will certainly have to be better against either Jannik Sinner or Novak Djokovic in the final. The Spaniard was well off his best in the first two sets, playing inpatience tennis and making several errors. However, he has two days to get ready, and you can be sure he will be.

16:58 CET - Carlos Alcaraz has found top gear now, and has soared ahead to take the third set 6-0 against a Lorenzo Musetti who appears to be tiring. The Spaniard is fully in the driving seat now.

16:34 CET - It hasn't been vintage stuff at all from Carlos Alcaraz at Roland Garros, and he is making plenty of errors, but he has still managed to find a way to snatch the second set 7-6(3), and level proceedings against Lorenzo Musetti. When it really mattered, the Spaniard upped his game in the tiebreak, against an opponent who is playing extremely well.

15:29 CET - Well, hello there! Lorenzo Musetti has broken in the final game of the set to take the opener 6-4 against Carlos Alcaraz. A solid set for the Italian to win it, with a solid serve and good play at the net.

14:34 CET - Carlos Alcaraz and Lorenzo Musetti are out on the court warming up, with the start of the first semi-final just minutes away.

Follow the match live here.

12:00 CET - Welcome back to the Tennis Tracker this Friday afternoon, with a pair of seismic semi-final clashes on the cards at the French Open.

Up first at 14:30 CET, defending champion Carlos Alcaraz takes on Lorenzo Musetti, who has enjoyed a stunning clay-court season, reaching at least the semi-finals at every event.

Alcaraz will definitely go into the match as the favourite and has beaten Musetti on the clay of Monte Carlo and Rome in the last few months. He also leads the head-to-head 5-1. However, the Italian is playing the best tennis of his career and will be targeting an upset.

That will be followed by a massive meeting between world number one Jannik Sinner and three-time French Open champion Novak Djokovic.

For the first time in a while, Djokovic goes in as the big underdog. He has done a remarkable job getting to the semi-finals at 38 years old and with not much form this season, but will this be a step too far? However, write off the legendary Serb at your peril, and he will certainly have a plan for Sinner.

Sinner has been utterly relentless this tournament, not yet dropping a set and swatting aside all his opponents with ease. But this will certainly be his biggest test, and if he is slightly off his best, Djokovic will do everything to make him pay.

 Catch all the US Open tennis action at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York City. lev radin/Shutterstock 

Visitors to New York City are spoiled for choice when it comes to world-class events: this is a town that knows how to put on a show. One of the city's many major moments each year – the US Open Tennis Championships – takes place in Queens for two weeks on either side of Labor Day. It's a spectacle I've been lucky enough to attend for several years, and I promise that despite the price tag, few marquee experiences are as rewarding.

The US Open is a fortnight of Grand Slam tennis in the city that never sleeps and is one of the most vibrant and visceral sporting events on Earth. Where else can you watch matches into the wee hours of the morning alongside bonafide movie stars and bigwigs, with a boisterous and vocal crowd that hangs on every point? Professional tennis players agree this is the most exciting and electric tournament on the tour. Even if you don't normally watch tennis, attending the US Open is an energizing experience. There's also much to do and see off the courts; the local food offerings alone are worth the trip to Flushing Meadows. 

Here's everything you need to know about New York's Grand Slam tournament.

The tournament takes place from late August to early September, and 2025 is the first year with a Sunday start, on August 24, allowing tennis fans to see first-round action without having to take a day off work. The matches go on for two weeks, day and night, culminating in the finals on September 6 and 7. The day sessions begin at 11am, while the evening sessions kick off at 7pm.

All events take place at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, New York. 

Tickets to the US Open cost a lot of money. And all the sessions sell out almost immediately after going on sale, leaving only marked-up resale tickets on Ticketmaster. I won't say there's no way to get non-resale, face-value tickets – but that has been my experience. Other online ticket vendors, such as SeatGeek and StubHub, also offer resale tickets. It's best to shop around, and definitely make sure any ticket vendor guarantees the veracity and existence of the tickets. 

To give an idea of prices, a first-round grounds pass for the day session (which means you can access outer courts and smaller stadiums on a first-come-first-serve basis) is currently hovering around $350 (originally selling for $175), but prices can, though rarely do, fluctuate.

The deeper you get into the tournament – or if you wish to get assigned seating in one of the three stadiums – the more you'll have to pay. It can get, frankly, ridiculous and infuriating. What's worse is that after you pony up double what tickets originally cost, you'll see an ungodly abundance of empty seats, especially in the early rounds. DO BETTER, US OPEN!

If money is no object, check out On Location, which specializes in hospitality offerings, such as individual courtside seats and access to a luxury box.

Pro tip: There is a way to experience the Open without dropping a dime: Fan Week. The week before the action starts, anyone can visit the grounds at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and get a taste of the action. While there are no matches, you can catch Carlos Alcaraz, Jessica Pegula, Ben Shelton, Iga Świątek and all the big-name star players practicing on all the courts. 

Night sessions are where the fire is, and they get more boisterous as the tournament progresses. I prefer day sessions during the early rounds, and I recommend arriving early because lines can be long. Doors open at 9:30am during the tournament and at 10am during Fan Week.

Few options are more convenient than hotels near Flushing, Queens. Those hotels usually sell out early, but keep an eye out for cancellations. Alternatively, you can stay in Manhattan and commute via subway. Airbnb and short-term rentals have been all but outlawed (unless the host is there), so hotels or crashing with friends or family are your best bet. 

I usually suggest the NH Collection near Grand Central Station to people who come in from out of town. It's a generally affordable, convenient, well-appointed 4-star hotel that isn't on many travelers' radars. Rooms hover around $300–400 per night, for two nights early in the tournament. That may sound pricey, but by Manhattan standards it's a good deal. Our New York City guidebook also recommends the chic Boro Hotel in Long Island City. 

For something more unique, NYC has some charming B&Bs, including the Black-owned Akwaaba Mansion in Brooklyn, that can give you a taste of local life as well as a memorable, personalized stay. 

Could you drive or take an Uber? Yes. But real New Yorkers take the 7 train to Mets-Willets Point (Citi Field is here, too) to get to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows. From Grand Central Station, it takes about 45 minutes and a short walk over a pedestrian bridge will bring you to the entrance. This is NYC at its best.

Bring as little as possible to remain unencumbered and whiz through the security checks. I carry only my phone (it doubles as my wallet), a spare charger, a hat, sunglasses and my fave liquid 50 SPF sunscreen (no spray cans allowed) to prevent my skin from burning. Stuff all of it into your pockets if possible, and if you need to bring a bag (no backpacks), you may have to put up with a longer line for it to go through the security screening – bags need to be small (12” W x 12” H x 16” L).

There are so many wonderful things to eat and drink at the Open, and it's all pretty pricey (nothing about tennis is cheap). They change up the purveyors every year, but they're all local: try a Fuku fried chicken sandwich, a lobster roll from Red Hook Lobster Pound, or cool off with some Van Leeuwen Ice Cream (the affogato cream is my favorite). 

If you're a drinker, you must order a Honey Deuce, the tournament's signature cocktail made with Grey Goose vodka, lemonade, raspberry liqueur and a spear of three tennisy melon balls,  served in a commemorative plastic cup – it's the perfect souvenir. Or you can opt for an Aperol spritz from the eponymous stand near the outer courts.

You can pay to store luggage prior to entering the grounds if you're arriving at the Tennis Center before you can drop your gear. 

Chase cardholders can borrow mobile phone chargers, and American Express cardholders get portable radios that wrap around your ear, so you can hear the televised commentary. 

Expect large crowds on the grounds. It can be difficult to navigate, so get your bearings before you arrive, download the US Open app with the grounds map and decide what matches you want to see and the courts on which they'll be played.

You can only enter certain courts at certain intervals during each match, so don't get frustrated if you're held back from entering. 

Finally (and this is probably not encouraged), after the day session, I stay on the grounds and perch myself outside Arthur Ashe (the center court of the US Open) to watch the first few games of the evening session from the main plaza, Honey Deuce in hand. This is how I watched Serina Williams' final professional match, along with a large crowd of fans, and it is one of my favorite moments of any tournament I've ever attended.

Novak Djokovic looks to stay in the running for a record 25th Grand Slam title with a semifinal battle looming Friday at the 2025 French Open. The match is scheduled to start at 1 p.m. ET (7 p.m. in Paris) with TV coverage on TNT and truTV and streaming on-demand.

Sinner carries the world No. 1 ranking and is on a head-to-head hot streak with Djokovic, having beaten him in four of their past five meetings. Friday's semifinal will be their first meeting of the 2025 season, during which Sinner won his second straight Grand Slam tournament at the Australian Open. The 23-year-old Italian has yet to win the French Open and could make personal history if he beats Djokovic to make his first career final. 

#1 Jannik Sinner vs. #6 Novak Djokovic

French Open semifinal at a glance

Djokovic had to survive a major test in No. 3 Alexander Zverev in the quarterfinal round, winning three straight sets after dropping the opener to surge into the semis. Though the French Open is statistically Djokovic's least successful with three wins in 20 tries, he has won the tournament twice in the past four years. Djokovic had his bid for a second straight Roland Garros title cut short last year when he had to retire due to injury.

Coco Gauff's first Grand Slam title came at the 2023 U.S. Open by beating Aryna Sabalenka in the final

PARIS — The biggest difference Coco Gauff sees between the player who lost her first Grand Slam final at the 2022 French Open at age 18 , and the one who will play for the trophy again on Saturday at 21, this time against No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, is the way she views the importance of the occasion.

Three years ago at Roland-Garros , Gauff was making her debut on that sort of stage and with that sort of prize at stake. It felt like the outcome meant absolutely everything, a burden that was a lot at the time and made her nervous.

Now, the No. 2-ranked Gauff says, she understands “how miniscule” the result Saturday is in the scheme of things.

“Everybody is dealing with way bigger things in life than losing a final,” the American said after beating 361st-ranked French wild-card entry Loïs Boisson 6-1, 6-2 in the semifinals Thursday.

“I'm sure there are hundreds of players that would kill to win or lose a final, so just knowing that (makes) me realize how lucky and privileged I am to be in this position,” Gauff said. “At first, I thought it would be the end of the world if I lost, and, you know, the sun still rose the next day. ... Regardless of the result, the sun will still rise.”

Here's another key difference: The Gauff of today is a Grand Slam champion. She won the 2023 U.S. Open ; her opponent in that final just so happened to be Sabalenka.

“I just remember kind of feeling,” Gauff said, “like I was holding my breath to the match point.”

Their head-to-head series is tied 5-5 entering the first No. 1 vs. No. 2 matchup in a French Open women's final since Serena Williams beat Maria Sharapova in 2023.

Sabalenka beat Gauff in their most recent meeting, which came at the Madrid Open in May on the type of red clay used at Roland-Garros. So Gauff is well aware of Sabalenka's many talents, which were on full display during a 7-6 (1), 4-6, 6-0 semifinal victory over three-time defending champion Iga Swiatek .

“She can come up with some big shots and big winners pretty much at all areas of the court,” Gauff said about the 27-year-old from Belarus. “She's a fighter, as well. She's going to stay in the match regardless of the scoreline.”

After getting pushed to a third set by Swiatek, who had won 26 matches in a row at the French Open, Sabalenka was pretty much perfect down the stretch.

Even Sabalenka called the lopsided nature of that last set “shocking for me.”

She didn't make a single unforced error; Swiatek had 12.

“The pace was from her (was) super fast,” Swiatek said. “It was just hard to get into any rally.”

Sabalenka took over the top ranking from Swiatek last October and has remained there. Sabalenka is 40-6 this season with three titles and, while her three major championships all came on hard courts — at the 2023 and 2024 Australian Opens and the 2024 U.S. Open — the work she's put in to improve on clay is clearly paying off.

“I can go flat. I can (play) with the spin. I can go back and play in defense,” Sabalenka said. “That's what works the best on the clay court for me.”

The truth is, regardless of the surface, Sabalenka still appears to be most comfortable when she hits the ball as hard as possible.

Her high-risk style offers a contrast to Gauff, who has been making an effort to be more aggressive with her forehand but usually is at her best when she is making opponents hit shot after shot because she can get to everything with her speed, instincts and defense.

“She's going to come out swinging,” Gauff said. “I just have to expect that and do my best to kind of counter that.”

Last June as a 15-year-old wild card, Hannah Klugman made it to the final round of Wimbledon qualifying on a surface British players traditionally prefer.Nearly twelve months later, Klugman has posted her best junior singles result across the English Channel on red clay. Seeded No. 8 in the Roland Garros girls' event, the now 16-year-old finds herself two wins away from lifting the trophy.“Everyone says the Brits don't like the clay. But I actually really like it!” Klugman told Prakash Amritraj on Tennis Channel.“I think it really suits my game. Me and my coach this year, we said let's do a long bloc on clay. We've done two months and I'm really loving it. I'm not ready to get off yet and go to grass.”

As Klugman navigates the external noise that comes with an upward trajectory in the sport, a compatriot of note is ready to guide her through it all. Earlier this year, world No. 5 Jack Draper had lunch with his fellow Londoner and encouraged Klugman to reach out when she needs a hand.“We go through a lot of mentally tough times. Last year, I kind of struggled a bit. He spoke to me a lot,” Klugman shared. “He had a time when he also struggled.“He really helped me and he's been someone who's always there. He said to me, ‘whenever you need help, I'm here for you.' That was really nice.”

That was really nice.”

“He really helped me and he's been someone who's always there. He said to me, ‘whenever you need help, I'm here for you.' That was really nice.”

Klugman isn't running away from the spotlight, either. The energetic teen, now in online schooling, keeps “normal” by staying close to her friends. Top 25-ranked juniors Mika Stojsavljevic (No. 6) and Mingge “Mimi” Xu (No. 24) provide plenty of local competition to ensure no one feels alone in the path being taken.“I think it's pretty cool. I love it. I'm still young, I'm enjoying it. It's a long journey, I've realized,” said Klugman, who has also contested a pair of junior Grand Slam doubles finals. “I just take it in my stride and I'm excited. We've got an amazing bunch of juniors right now. We definitely push each other to be better.”A stretch of play on home soil awaits after Paris, with her backyard tournament waiting in the wings. A good time with her friends and another chat with Draper just may be on the calendar of events, too.

As the other Grand Slams embrace automation, the French Open remains rooted in a more tactile, time-honored version of the game.

In the third set of her fourth-round match, serving at 4-4, Elena Rybakina faced a break point. When her second serve was called out, Iga Swiatek began the walk to her changeover chair, thinking she'd be serving for the match.

But chair umpire Kader Nouni, unsure of the line judge's call, scrambled down from his seat and scrutinized the mark. He (correctly, as it turned out) determined that the ball had clipped the service line and Rybakina was awarded a first serve -- and rallied from 15-40 down to take the lead Swiatek thought was hers.

“I wasn't overthinking it,” Swiatek said later. “When I came close, yeah, the ball seemed like it touched the line. Elena, I don't think she asked for the umpire's opinion, but he obviously needs to check if he has doubts.

“So for sure I felt like it's over a little bit, but on the other hand, I just refocused immediately. It wasn't such a big deal for me. It was more just a situation, and it passed, and I was ready for another ball anyway.”

Swiatek won 12 of the last 15 points to advance to the quarterfinals at Roland Garros, keeping alive her quest for a fourth consecutive title. But the “situation” focused attention on The French Tennis Federation's resistance to electronic line calling (ELC) and the decision to employ conventional line judges.

The Australian Open turned to ELC in 2021 and the US Open followed a year later. With Wimbledon, the epitome of tennis history, set to pivot to ELC later this month, the French Open is the last Grand Slam holdout. The new technology is now required at all ATP Tour events, including clay, the only surface where the ball always leaves a visible mark.

“For Roland Garros, we want to keep our linesmen as long as the players agree with that,” said FFT President Gilles Moretton.

But how long will that be? The majority of the players, despite occasional, high-profile, in-match objections, seem to side with technology.

“I don't know if it's like Gen Z in me, but I think if we have the technology we should use it,” Coco Gauff said. “Obviously umpires are great. These small details in the match can matter in the grand scheme of things.

“But I respect the tournament's decision, and I respect the fact that they still have line umpires. I'm not going to be out here advocating and pushing for it. But yeah, if I had a preference I would choose to play on the court maybe where the robots are making the decisions.”

But, of course, there are misgivings, too. Resisting technology -- embracing the status quo -- is a natural impulse. It's what we're used to. It's why people of a certain age prefer newspapers to reading online, or old-fashioned CDs (in extreme cases, even vinyl records) to streaming music.

ELC, in theory, allows for the depth of the layer of clay on the court and the speed and trajectory of the ball on impact. Still, there are questions.

Back in April, World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka fought technology … with technology.

It was 3-3 against Elise Mertens at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, when her volley was called out by ELC, giving the game to Mertens. Sabalenka objected, prompting chair umpire Miriam Bley to inspect the mark. She confirmed the call, but during the changeover, Sabalenka grabbed a phone supplied by her team, walked over to the mark and snapped a photo.

The crowd was divided between whistles and cheers, but Bley hit Sabalenka with a code violation for unsportsmanlike conduct.

Later, after winning nine of the last 10 games, Sabalenka insisted the ball was in.

“We all making mistakes, and it's OK,” Sabalenka explained later. “Right now I prefer the Hawk-Eye system. I trust it more with most of the referees.”

At the Mutua Madrid Open, Alexander Zverev made headlines by taking a photo of a mark from Alejandro Davidovich Fokina that ELC called in, but he thought was out.

There was another collision between man and machine in the fourth round when Zheng Qinwen, serving at 4-2 in the third set, hit an apparent ace to get to deuce with Liudmila Samsonova. There was no objection from ELC, but chair umpire Pierre Bacchi studied the mark before calling it out. The double fault gave Samsonova the game and, temporarily, the match was back on serve.

Mirra Andreeva was serving for the match in her Round of 16 match against Yuliia Starodubtseva when a massive power outage shook Madrid. The chair umpire agreed to call the lines and Andreeva dug out of a 15-40 hole to win the match.

While Andreeva appreciated the intervention, she prefers electronic line calling.

“It's kind of what the system says, you just go with it, and you cannot really argue with that,” Andreeva said. “It's just easier for me to not to pay attention if the call is right or wrong.”

Madison Keys, the Australian Open champion, has mixed feelings.

“I think it's great in some ways because it takes kind of the arguing out of it,” she said. “I also know that electronic line calling has a margin for error. I think it gets a little bit tricky when you're staring at a mark that's clearly out, but the board is saying that it's touching. 

“I don't know where I stand on it quite yet.”

With only a few matches left at Roland Garros, we might well be seeing the end of an era.

“I don't know,” Sabalenka said. “I had situation with the referee in Stuttgart, and also there was tricky calls with the Hawk-Eye system in Rome. I guess there is some, like, old school why having the referees and calling the referee to check the mark. I think that's something which brings like in old days, which is cool, probably.

“Honestly, I'm really confused with my opinion.”

As the other Grand Slams embrace automation, the French Open remains rooted in a more tactile, time-honored version of the game.

The American, regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time—with four Olympic gold medals and 23 Grand Slam singles titles—says winning the title in Melbourne while expecting her first daughter was the highlight of her career. 'I don't know how I did that.'

Serena Williams had many outstanding moments during her storied tennis career.

But the American superstar singles out winning a Grand Slam while pregnant as probably her most astonishing achievement.

“I don't know how I did that, honestly,” Williams said on Wednesday (6 June) at the SuperReturn private equity conference in Berlin, Germany.

“I don't know what I was doing then, I was nine weeks pregnant ... I do remember not being able to run for a long time.”

The four-time Olympic gold medallist, now 43, won a record 23 Grand Slam title at the 2017 Australian Open while pregnant with her first of two daughters, Olympia, at the age of 35. Even more remarkable was that she didn't drop a set on her way to winning her seventh title in Melbourne.

She beat her sister Venus in that epic final.

“I didn't tell anyone,” continued Williams, who retired from professional in 2022 after a 27-year career.

“I mean, Venus knew, and I still feel really bad about that, because a deep part of me feels like because we played each other in the final, I'm like, she must have known, and she must have felt some sort of deep heaviness to go even further and go all out. But she was only one of two people that knew.”

“I remember one time playing a long point against one player, and I couldn't breathe. And I'm like, how does she not see that I'm not able to breathe right now, and so I just intentionally lost the next point just to kind of try and get my energy back. But then I was like: Why am I playing this far pregnant? This is nuts.”

Williams was speaking in Berlin to private equity professionals as the owner of Serena Ventures, a venture capital firm she runs.

Judy Murray doesn't believe her son Andy Murray will take up a new coaching role ahead of Wimbledon after his split with Novak Djokovic.

Djokovic and Murray announced the end of their partnership last month despite the Serbian previously stating that he hoped to continue working with the British legend through the French Open and Wimbledon this year.

Some fans were hoping to see Murray form a dream team with Emma Raducanu but that looks to be unlikely ahead of this year's Championships with Mark Petchey set for a bigger role during the 2025 grass-court swing.

Three-time major winner Murray has previously named Raducanu as a player he'd love to coach one day along with British No.1 Jack Draper, Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz and Greek star Stefanos Tsitsipas.

But his mother Judy doesn't think her son is ‘ready to jump straight back into coaching' and suggested he may take some time away from tennis.

‘Andy had just retired and wasn't looking to go into coaching but he stepped in because Novak asked him,' she told The Herald.

‘When they joined-up, I was certainly interested to see how he got on being on the other side of things and realising how stressful it can be.

Djokovic had been in poor form all season ahead of the French Open, which is currently ongoing, and it seems he made the change to boost his chances of a strong performance at Roland-Garros.

The Murray split appears to have paid off after Djokovic booked his spot in the French Open semi-finals on Wednesday with an impressive win over Alexander Zverev, who was the runner-up in Paris last year.

Read statements from Murray and Djokovic here about their split.

‘I don't think he's ready to jump straight back into coaching, though, because the tennis circuit is relentless.

‘I can see him doing a consultant type role with young players and he's already done a lot of mentoring with the British players on the men's side who are coming through but I can't see him being a full-time tennis coach.

‘There's more to life than jumping straight back into the tennis rat race after nearly 20 years as a player. 

‘I don't think he'll necessarily want to jump back onto that merry-go-round – not when you're someone who's got four kids to taxi around and you want to get your golf handicap to scratch.

‘Whether he does it in the future, I don't know – that's for him to answer and I actually don't think he knows the answer either but my guess is not right now.'

Since his retirement from tennis after the Olympic Games in Paris last year, Murray has spent lots of time on the golf course.

Murray made his Pro-Am debut at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth in September, teaming up with fellow Scot Robert MacIntyre.

‘For someone that's not really played that much, I thought he was good,' MacIntyre said about Murray's golfing skills. ‘I was very impressed with his game.'

Murray regularly posts videos and pictures of himself playing golf across his social media accounts and has become a member at Beaverbrook Golf Club in Surrey.

The former world No.1 tennis star signed his first golf equipment deal earlier this year, becoming a brand ambassador for Callaway.

Murray, who appeared at this year's French Open for Rafael Nadal's farewell ceremony, could now be set for a golfing reunion with his former Spanish rival.

Jim Courier enjoyed a legendary tennis career, reaching world number one and winning multiple Grand Slam titles.

Competing for 12 years between 1988 and 2000, Courier won four Grand Slam titles and held the number one ranking for 58 weeks.

Courier won the Australian Open and French Open twice, but fell short in his sole final appearances at Wimbledon and the US Open.

Retiring in 2000, Courier began working as a commentator shortly after, sharing his opinions on the sport with fans around the world.

He did just that during Novak Djokovic's win over Alexander Zverev on Wednesday night, as the American selected the greatest single game of tennis he'd ever seen.

During his commentary of Djokovic's quarterfinal win at the 2025 French Open, Courier named the greatest game of tennis he'd seen.

“We shouldn't really be surprised that we've seen some of the most breathtaking single points between these two players,” he said.

“The single greatest game that I've ever seen played in tennis was these two guys in the semi-finals of the US Open in 2021.

“[Alexander] Zverev serving to stay in the set at that point, one set apiece. 

“There was an 18-shot rally, 32, a 12-shot rally, a 21-shot rally, a 53-shot rally, and finally [Novak] Djokovic broke serve on a 17-shot rally to take the set.

“He would win it in five sets, but I've never seen a game that competitive before or since. It was astonishing, the physicality, the emotion, it was a privilege to witness it.

“You think about the greatest round of boxing you've ever seen, this was the tennis version.”

On set point at *4-5, 15-40, Zverev and Djokovic battled it out in one of the greatest points of Grand Slam tennis you will ever see.

The pair hit the ball ferociously for over a minute before a thunderous forehand from Zverev won the marathon 53-shot rally.

It was going to be tough to top that, but Zverev and Djokovic certainly came close during their French Open quarterfinal match.

Down break point in the fourth set against Zverev, Djokovic proved why many consider him to be the greatest of all time.

After 38 brutal shots, Djokovic hit a beautiful drop shot which his German rival did well to retrieve.

Zverev's return gave Djokovic a great chance to hit a forehand, an opportunity he grasped as he saved the break point. 

Commentator John McEnroe couldn't quite believe what he'd seen.

“I've got goosebumps just watching these two dig deep right there,” he said.

McEnroe wasn't the only one to be impressed by the point as fans took to X to share their thoughts.

Wow. Just wow. 41 shot rally that had pretty much everything. And on BP!

“Wow. Just wow,” said one fan.

“41-shot rally that had pretty much everything, and on break point.”

“Unreal, mind-boggling, jaw-dropping 41-shot rally to save a break point,” added another.

“Novak Djokovic is 38 years old, playing a 28-year-old. Beyond crazy.”

Djokovic with that 41-shot rally to save break point. He never gives up.

“Djokovic with that 41-shot rally to save a break point. He never gives up,” said another fan.

“That 41-shot rally shows why tennis is pure art. Not just about power, it's footwork, stamina, and pure grit. Djokovic's mental toughness in these marathon points is what separates champions from contenders,” said one fan on X. 

Djokovic went on to win the match in four sets, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4, booking his place in the semi-finals where he'll take on Jannik Sinner.

Sinner and Djokovic will face off for a place in the French Open final on Friday, June 6.

The festival's founder, Kevin Lyman, talks about revitalizing the 30-year-old punk rock road show and why $149 is the right price for today's fans.

	Dave Brooks



Vans Warped Tour might be one of the best-selling festivals of 2025, but organizers say no one music act is responsible for moving the bulk of the 240,000 tickets sold so far across three U.S. cities. Indeed, the brand name alone seems to have been enough. 


	“We sold the vast majority of those tickets before we had a lineup,” says Kevin Lyman, founder and producer of the traveling punk show, which ran from 1995 to 2018 before returning this year for a limited 30th anniversary run. Lyman, who has partnered with Live Nation festival company Insomniac for this year's Warped, is working from a makeshift office and headquarters after the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year forced him to leave his Altadena home, which was damaged but largely spared from the blaze.  


	“I think there's nostalgia in the market, but it's not just for the music — people are longing for events that are affordable and give them a chance to discover something,” says Lyman. Prices for this year's Warped Tour are $149 for a two-day pass, and the tour is much shorter, with just three stops this year instead of the typical 36 markets. Two of the three markets piggyback off events organized by Insomniac: Warped's Washington, D.C. stop, from June 14-15, comes two weeks after Insomniac's Project Glow EDM fest; while the Orlando stop, Nov. 15-16, takes place one week after EDC Orlando at Camping World Stadium. Warped Tour is also coming to Long Beach, Calif., from July 26-27 at Shoreline Waterfront Park. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Each of the three two-day stops on the tour accounts for nearly 80,000 tickets sold. When combined, the fans attending all six days of the Warped Tour this summer will have purchased 240,000 tickets. That's likely more tickets than were sold at Coachella this year, which took place over two consecutive three-day weekends, sources tell Billboard. It also likely surpasses the number of tickets sold at the three-day Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas. 


Billboard recently caught up with Lyman to discuss the 30th anniversary tour, including how he pitched it to Steven Van Doren, son of Vans founder Paul Van Doren; his expectations from the fans; and whether the 2025 outing is a one-and-done or has the potential to return in 2026 and beyond. 


What made you decide to bring Warped Tour back? 


	People don't miss something until it's taken away. I had a fantastic crew; we did a lot of marketing for bands and helped a lot of younger artists. And then, when we took it away, people realized that there was a place for something like Warped Tour. But by then I was busy doing other things — traveling, teaching my class at USC and working on other projects. And then the pandemic hit, and being on a college campus and being around young people, I could see a new need for Warped Tour arise.  


What kind of reception have you received so far? 


	I think it's been exciting because the bands that remember Warped Tour remember how important it was to their careers, and the younger bands now are super excited to be able to have that experience and be part of it.  


Why did you bring in Insomniac for this year's Warped Tour? 


	There's a lot of people over there that grew up around Warped Tour, attended in the past and even worked on Warped Tour. Maureen Valker-Barlow, who works as a senior vp at Insomniac and landed her first job at Warped Tour, approached me, and it was easy for us to figure out how to work together. And then it was like the green light came on, and we just ran with it. They have great people over there like Amanda Phelan, who is a great booker, and Maureen, who I previously mentioned, handling sponsorship, as well as Chris Barlow and Nathan Armstrong in production. I've always operated as very small and independent, working in a garage, and they're a big company, and they know how to run festivals. They handle a lot of the day-to-day stuff, absorbing a significant part of the logistics. And marketing. They've given me a little bit more of that structure.  What was it like approaching Vans to do another tour?  That was easy, because Steve Van Doren and myself go back — we're talking 25 years of Warped Tour and years before that. It was easy to go over there and say, “Hey, here's the idea, let's bring it back with these people. I have faith in them.”  Sure, there was a lot of paperwork, but it only took ten minutes of conversation to get this thing going. 


Was it difficult to come up with a budget around a $149 ticket price? 


	Not at all, because I knew from the beginning that Warped would only work if we kept the ticket price fair. I feel strongly that a $149, two-day ticket is affordable to our fans. I think 90% of the reason that people are getting turned off by festivals is because they're too expensive. Warped was always the show for people that maybe didn't have that money for some of the other festivals. Both myself and Insomniac felt $149 was the right price, and a lot of people have responded to that price. It also helps that we delivered the lineup. It's an eclectic lineup that touches on our history and past, but it also looks forward to the future. I'm excited to see which of the younger bands we've booked get the biggest reaction from the fans. 


You've got some big names on the lineup this year like Avril Lavigne, Fishbone, Less Than Jake, Dropkick Murphys, Pennywise and Sublime. You've also got dozens of baby bands and newcomers scheduled to play. How do you strike the right balance between old and new? 


	Well, it's partially an economic exercise. Every band you book, no matter how big, makes up part of your ticket price, and you always have a few that are reliable and a few that are more of a gamble. We're booking some of these bands in January, wondering how big they will be in August? Are they going to be bigger than what we paid them? Can the $5,000 band generate $25,000 in value from fans who are excited to see them? If you look at our social media right now, we really don't need to push Sublime or Rise Against. They're already known. People are going to enjoy them, and they're going to have a big, big crowd. We want to grab onto those younger acts like LØLØ or Honey Revenge and really boost them on our social media so they have a big audience at Warped Tour. A lot of what we focus on is leveraging the Warped brand and the larger bands to help raise the profile of the smaller acts. 


Did you get the idea to list the bands on the lineup poster in alphabetical order from Insomniac? 


	No, that's something I started doing in 1996 because I hate arguing over billing. I think we waste so much time arguing over font size on the poster when we should be marketing to fans and getting behind the show. People are smart. People will come and find the bands they want to see. If you could put Korn in the bottom corner of a festival lineup, people would find them and be excited about them.  


What about scheduling? How do you keep egos in check with the schedule? 


	We don't announce the set times until the day of the show. I do that because I want people to come early and enjoy all the young bands. I go to too many festivals where people come in at sunset and miss all the great young bands. And my thing is, Warped fans are diehard music fans. They're not fashion fans, they're there for the music. And they're going to figure out the lineup. And I think everything we're doing so far is working. Hopefully, we deliver the show that people will want to come see next year. 


So Warped is not a one-and-done? This is a multi-year project? 


	I want to really go see what the first show is like in D.C. before we make any final decisions on that. I want to go see the audience and who's coming. Is it people that want to be part of something moving forward, or people trying to capture a memory? My guess is that it will be a blend of both, but we'll see. 


Could it return as a true touring property, going from city to city, buses and all? 


	No. Definitely not. I can't do that to myself, hitting the road for two months straight. I've had seven different surgeries because of the Warped Tour. I don't need any more.

			By Anthony D'Alessandro, Justin Kroll 


EXCLUSIVE: Talks for who'll wind up with the much-prized Texas Chainsaw Massacre IP are beginning Monday as anywhere from five to eight studios and/or streamers are vying for the rights of the Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel created property which canvases film, TV, live events and games. 


	We first told about this beauty contest, administered by Verve; the agency having repped the rights to the slasher franchise since 2017. Exurbia Films is the primary production company behind Texas Chainsaw Massacre with Pat Cassidy, Ian Henkel and Kim Henkel as producers. The property is repped by attorney Marios Rush. 

	











	There are no clear frontrunners, however, new creative parties have emerged with a passion for the project. Myriad notable creative entities have teamed up with studios to pitch Verve and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre rights holders on their vision for notorious killer Leatherface, who uses his chainsaw to go on a cannibalistic killing spree. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Since we first told you about the project, Taylor Sheridan's name has gained steam as having interest in the property. At this point in time, Sheridan would only serve as a producer on a future Texas Chainsaw Massacre project. No surprise that he's interested as Sheridan was raised in Texas. 


	In regards to the Oz Perkins' version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, we understand the Longlegs filmmaker would only produce and co-write with Bryan Bertino. Bertino, who directed the original 2008 The Strangers, would helm this particular version of Leatherface, should NEON win rights. 

	











	Jordan Peele's Monkeypaw is another new party to emerge with an eye on Texas Chainsaw Massacre, also in producing capacity. Monkeypaw has a production deal at Universal.  


	We first reported that Strange Darling‘s J.T. Mollner and A Minecraft Movie and Weapons producer Roy Lee were kicking the tires. We understand that's a TV a pitch aligned with A24, and will have Austin, TX native Glen Powell involved, but not starring. 


	Separately, Lee has a feature film pitch for Texas Chainsaw Massacre which would be set up at Netflix. 


	The original 1974 movie was made for $140K and distributed Bryanston Distributing Company, famed for its theatrical release of 1972 X-rated title Deep Throat. Texas Chainsaw Massacre would go on to make $31M with the filmmakers getting stiffed on profits. In 1983, New Line Cinema acquired distribution rights with the entire franchise via nine movies grossing north of $252M worldwide There also comics, a novel and two video game adaptations. 


	New Line launched a prolific 2003 remake directed by German filmmaker Marcus Nispel with Michael Bay producing and pre-Quiet Place Andrew Form and Brad Fuller executive producing. Starring Jessica Biel just as she was segueing from 7th Heaven to feature films, that title remains the highest-grossing in the 51-year old franchise at $107M.


	Classic horror franchises, rebooted after several years laid dormant, are a big a business, especially when left in the hands of passionate auteurs, i.e. Scream VI under the direction of Radio Silence opened to a series best at the domestic box office with $44.4M (and $108M domestic), ditto for 2018's Halloween which saw the return of Jamie Lee Curtis under the direction of David Gordon Green; that pic opening to a franchise high of $76.2M (and ending its domestic at $159.3M). Recently, Final Destination: Bloodlines, the first sequel in 14 years in the New Line 25-year old series, opened to a franchise high of $51.6M and quickly became the highest installment in a six film series with a current running global take of $235M.

Summer doesn't technically start until June 20 this year, but already its season of new movies is in full swing. Earlier this week, journalists caught the first IMAX preview screening of Joseph Kosinski's racing drama “F1” — starring Brad Pitt, who does his own driving, and in theaters from Warner Bros. June 27 before streaming later on Apple TV+.

The purported $300-million movie also stars “Snowfall” breakout Damson Idris as Pitt's rookie prodigy, plus Javier Bardem, Kerry Condon, Tobias Menzies, and Shea Whigham. “Screen Talk” podcast co-host Anne Thompson caught the early screening, praising the film‘s technical specs and Pitt's intense gaze from behind the steering wheel, as he balances a dramatic performance with actual race-car driving.

Co-host Ryan Lattanzio finally caught up with Celine Song's “Past Lives” follow-up “Materialists,” out from A24 June 13. Mixed early word-of-mouth out of New York City set an uncertain tone for the movie going in, but he says Song delivers an entertaining and shrewdly written rom-dram in the spirit of the greats of its genre from the late-'90s through the early aughts. Dakota Johnson stars as a disaffected matchmaker who's disarmed by a suave private equity broker played by Pedro Pascal. Meanwhile, she's reconnected with her ex-boyfriend, a middling New York theater actor and cater-waiter played by Chris Evans in one of his most compelling performances.

 










Anne argues that “Materialists” — far less fizzy than its marketing would have you believe, including a subplot involving Johnson's desperately single client played by “Succession” star Zoë Winters — doesn't satisfy as a romance. Ryan is more taken by the film, which at times fascinatingly feels like an ethnographic study of how a romantic comedy or drama moves, operates, and behaves. Anne doesn't think the chemistry between Johnson and Pascal sparks enough, while Ryan argues that's the point, as you'll see in the film. Where Anne and Ryan really disagree is in the commercial potential of “Materialists”; Anne sees the film as a box-office, audience-pleasing play, while Ryan attests that the film is darker, more cynical, and even at times weirder than the more conventionally minded movie it may appear to be on its surface.

In this week's episode, we also take a look at the ongoing Tribeca Festival in New York City, where Ryan has already seen a few standout titles on the ground. Plus, we debate whether exhibitors and theater owners should be allowed to join The Academy, as recently posited by Clayton Davis in a Variety piece. Anne explains why that shouldn't happen. It's a long road to creating another branch anyway, as The Academy has only just made way for stunt and casting kudos.

			By Denise Petski, Dessi Gomez 


UPDATED, June 6: The body swap shenanigans will continue at a whole new level in Freakier Friday, previewed in the film's newest trailer.


	Lindsey Lohan's Anna Coleman has many wedding preparations to undergo, and her mom Tess (Jamie Lee Curtis) is there to help. Unfortunately, Anna's daughter (Julia Butters) and Anna's husband-to-be Eric's (Manny Jacinto) daughter do not get along, as evidenced in Anna's daughter writing her mock vows and calling Lily Davies “a little demon thing with an obnoxious accent.”


	Flash forward from a fortune teller (Vanessa Bayer) incident on Anna's bachelorette where Bayer assesses that Butters' and Sophia Hammons' step sisters to be “are called to be family” and tells Anna and Tess that they may learn another lesson from “walking in each other's paths,” the lightning that does strike them twice puts them all in a quartet body swap situation.

	











	“Change the hearts you know are wrong,” Bayer's voice says. “To reach the place where you belong.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Chaos ensues as the four realize that Anna and her daughter have swapped bodies while Tess, aka grandma, and Lily have swapped bodies.

	Lily as Jamie Lee Curtis says “we can break our parents up for good,” and the original duo set out to do just that and “reunite her (Anna) with her first love” who is Chad Michael Murray's Jake.


Previous, March 14: They're back. Twenty-two years after the premiere of Freaky Friday, Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan have reunited as mother-daughter, reprising their roles as Tess and Anna Coleman, respectively, in the sequel Freakier Friday.












	The story picks up years after Tess (Curtis) and Anna (Lohan) endured an identity crisis. Anna now has a daughter of her own and a soon-to-be stepdaughter. As they navigate the myriad challenges that come when two families merge, Tess and Anna discover that lightning might indeed strike twice.

	Check out the first trailer below.


	In it, a fortune teller (Vanessa Bayer) reads Tess and Anna's palms and marvels at the fact that their life lines have intertwined in the past, while the mother-daughter duo tries to downplay that incident. She warns them that the lesson they learned might come into play once more.


	Set to Chappel Roan's “HOT TO GO!” the ground shakes and Tess and Anna find themselves going through a chaotic body swap all over again, but this time with two more people involved. And of course Chad Michael Murray, returning to reprise his role of Jake, rolls up on a motor cycle in the end of the clip to make a “grand, sexy entrance.” No sign of Manny Jacinto, who will play Lindsay Lohan's character's husband, or Never Have I Ever breakout Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, but eagle-eyed fans have spotted Elaine Hendrix, one of Lohan's costars from The Parent Trap (1998) in a brief scene.

	The film hits theaters on August 8.

Talking to Ridley Scott feels a bit like it must have been to watch gladiator matches in the Roman Colosseum: You never quite know what to expect, but it's guaranteed to be an exciting ride.

He's been knighted, nominated for four Oscars, and his films have grossed more than $5 billion worldwide. Even if he wasn't 87 years old and 30 films into an almost 50-year career, Scott has earned the right to talk about what he likes. On a recent Sunday morning, the subject was his 2005 film “Kingdom of Heaven,” which now receives a limited re-release in theaters and a spanking-new 4K transfer on home video. 

 










Starring Orlando Bloom, Eva Green, Jeremy Irons, David Thewlis, Brendan Gleeson, and Edward Norton, the original “Kingdom of Heaven” grossed $218 million worldwide up against a $130 million budget and mixed reviews. At the time an underwhelming period follow-up from the man who previously directed Best Picture winner “Gladiator,” its director's-cut version has earned a reputation as one of Scott's best films. Yet 20 years later, he's as eager to digress from his intended path as to luxuriate in a well-earned victory lap.

Related Stories Does ‘Materialists' Satisfy as a Romance? Screen Talk Debates Celine Song's Film, Shares ‘F1' First Reactions ‘I Don't Understand You' Review: Nick Kroll and Andrew Rannells Kill It in Grisly Destination Rom-Com 

Speaking recently to IndieWire, Ridley Scott looked back at “Kingdom of Heaven” and its unconventional approach to exploring the twin histories of Christianity and Islam in a post-9/11 cinematic landscape. In addition to comparing it to the red-meat satisfaction of “Gladiator,” Scott recalled the process of casting Edward Norton as leprosy-stricken King Balthazar without giving him credit, discussed the inspirations of David Lean and John Ford's “The Searchers,” and revealed the one script in his war chest of unrealized projects that he's still desperate to make.

This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

IndieWire: As the man who popularized director's cuts with “Blade Runner,” where does this film rank for you in terms of Hollywood's mistreatment of your work?

Ridley Scott: You could write a book about that, dude — and that would be Chapter One only. The problem is it is a constant aggressive dance between commerce against art, and each side has the right to have an opinion. If somebody's giving me a million dollars to fuck around and make my movie, he has a right to have some opinion. If somebody's giving me $200 million, he has every right to have a fucking opinion. If I was on that side, I would want to know everything. So in a way, you both get in each other's way. 

 










But I never made a movie until I was 40 — I was experienced in advertising. I'd done Steve Jobs' first commercial. but I'd probably done 2,000 or 3,000 commercials as a filmmaker and operator, and I was very, very successful where we had offices in Paris, London, New York, and L.A. So when I moved to Hollywood, I ain't a learner. I'm not a kid. I'm walking in with “The Duellists,” which won [best debut film] at Cannes. They [didn't] know what to do with it, so they made seven prints for America. My first film is “Duellists,” my second film is “Alien,” third one is “Blade Runner,” the fourth film is “Legend.” And at the end of all that, because none of them quite worked except for “Alien,” one of them said, “Have you ever thought making a film about normal people?” I thought, maybe they're right. So then there was a very little, really great film called “Someone to Watch Over Me.”

You had been intrigued by the Crusades for a really long time, but “Kingdom of Heaven” feels heavily filtered through a more secular, contemporary perspective. How intentional was that as you and William Monahan began to put this together?

Bill's writing is so persuasive that I didn't fully recognize, even though 9/11 had just happened, what thin ice we were walking on. Also, Bill's coming at it from a reverse point of view that the infidel[s] — us — are the assholes, and we are invading a place where we shouldn't even be. Doesn't that echo many cases today? We're not going to go there, but it fucking does. On top of that, the King of Morocco asked to see me, and so I go to his court, he sits down, has a cigarette, and we chat. He said, “This script is beautiful. It has such respect for my faith and my culture. I will help you and protect you.” That was the beginning, and I'd just had one of the best experiences I've ever had in Morocco. I've [now] done five things in Morocco. Frankly, I nearly always had a good time because I feel comfortable with the culture.

 










Was this film always meant to be a slightly more subdued or slower-burn kind of story than something soapier and more conventionally crowd-pleasing like “Gladiator”?

Listen, crowd-pleasing is a billion dollars, dude. So believe me, I'm very happy if I please the crowd. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that, because we are in the business of entertainment. If not, you shouldn't be doing it.

Of course, but was this something where that different perspective was going to demand an approach that wasn't as flashy as “Gladiator” was?

Well, I don't think “Gladiator” was flashy to start with, but I think I understood what the Roman universe would be like. I'm good at getting into the smell of the time. And all I can do is look at reference [materials] and try and imagine what it was like. In Rome, they still celebrate “Gladiator” by running the Coliseum once a year. So the Italians quite like it. And then “Kingdom of Heaven” was the most popular film in Egypt, and I think it's partly because when the film was put out 20 years ago, it seems to be about religion and the conflict of that. I think a certain kind of audience will simply not go and sit because they're not interested. So my feeling is that because of the platform [of home video], “Kingdom of Heaven” is there all the time, every night globally and people got to sit and go, “Wow, that's good.” And so off that, Fox now has had a very, very good 20 year run with it. And that's why they came back and said, “I want to put it out in 500 theaters in 4K. Are you up for it?” I said, “Of course.” Now, I've had many journalists who say they're experts, and they said, “But this was not like that… and that was not like that.” And my question to them was, “Were you there?” And they said, “No.” So I said, “Well, shut the fuck up. Go fuck yourself. Go write a book.”

 










There's this incredible silent weapon in this film with Edward Norton as the masked King Baldwin. Was he always meant to be uncredited?

He didn't want to. I said, “Ed, are you sure you want to do this?” He said, “Yes, I don't give a fuck. I want to be in the movie.” He said, “And don't credit me because I'm not there. It's only my voice. But [as an actor,] I want to experience the film.” And that was it.

And I got lucky because I met [Ghassan Massoud,] who was really a very strong Muslim actor who played Saladin so well and so sympathetically — fundamentally based on actual history. Saladin died, not exactly a pauper, but a poor man because he began life as a soldier, a general, a warrior, a philanthropist, a rich man. Then when he insisted people had to leave Jerusalem, and without [violence], his fervent guys with behind him said, “There has to be blood.” He said, “No, there has to be tax.” They settled for the tax to leave. Saladin paid for it, and it bankrupted him.

Restored in the director's cut, the inclusion of Sibylla's son was a big point of contention in the conception of this film. Were there other details that you faced hurdles in trying to include?

Bill wrote a character I can only describe within his Muslim faith as a fundamentalist who was constantly contradicting Saladin. There's great scenes where [this character] said, “Why haven't you done this? You should have done that.” And then Saladin would come back; he gives an answer which cuts his balls off. Every faith has fundamentalism, so we included those extremities, and the guy who played the extremist was fucking great as well.

 










Bill wrote the script, and now and then I was helpful. With [King Baldwin,] I used to live in a house from 1360. Does that say much? I had a fucking moat. It was lit with candles — nuts, right? I love feeling like I'm living in the past. And as Sibylla's brother, he got leprosy at 15, and he functioned till he died at 23, 24, and had to wear a mask because he was so disfigured. He had to be lifted in the saddle to appear to be fine because he was supporting his position as the King of Jerusalem. In the recorded history, it was purported that Sibylla's child had passed at about 13 or 14. It also suggested that the child may have had leprosy, and therefore, she could not bear to see her child go through what her brother would go through with an incurable disease. So we enlarged on that. [Eva Green] never forgave me for cutting that 17 minutes. Her mother shouted at me. “How can you do this?” I said, “I know, I'm sorry!”

I read a quote that said that “Lawrence of Arabia” is a constant point of inspiration for you as a filmmaker. When you're making a film like this, do you have a moment where you're like, “I don't mind stealing that shot of Peter O'Toole atop a sand dune?” Or, say, borrow a classic “Searchers” shot — those classic film tropes — when you're coming up with shots?
 










Yeah, the best shot in “The Searchers” is the doorway in silhouette, and [John Wayne] fucking steps outside. When I was 11 years old, I saw that and said, “I want to do a Western.” I mean, “The Searchers,” in many respects, you don't have war parties in that part of the world. They're Navajo, so it was all wrong. But it's majestic and marvelous, right? I just cannot criticize it. And not only that, it jumped onto the first idea that many women who had experienced life with a tribe never wanted to come back. Not because of what might be smuttily thought of as a thing, but the fact that their way of life was more attractive. So [John Ford] even dared to do that with Natalie Wood. Then they tried to correct it because John Wayne wants to shoot her.

But David Lean, I have great admiration for everything he did. One day I actually had lunch with him. I was making “Legend” with a 21-year-old Tom Cruise in Pinewood. I've got my massive forest on the Bond stage, and David walked in saying, “Who the is this madman building this fucking forest?” So he said, “You want to have lunch?” So I had lunch with David Lean. And he was great, very elegant man. Smoked a lot. And at two o'clock, he said, “I think you should get back.” I said, “Absolutely,” and I sort of saluted him and left.

 










Not just with this release, but in the 20 years since it was released, do you feel like “Kingdom of Heaven” has truly been vindicated?

If a film educates at all, it was worth it. People sit and watch this who'd never normally watch it, so thank you for streaming — otherwise, it would be lying on a fucking shelf in some vault somewhere for 20 years. “The Duellists” runs every night on Netflix. That's 50 years old! So thank God when people say, “What the fuck is that?” and click. And they go, and they're engaged. And in “The Duellists” you'll learn a little bit about Napoleon, right? You know, but I loved doing “Matchstick Men,” which is comically funny. But I try and change my venue constantly — I like being on thin ice.

Looking at your filmography, there are dozens of projects that came and went. “Tripoli” was the film that led to “Kingdom of Heaven.” Is there one among those unrealized projects that you haven't been able to do that still kind of haunts you?

Well, those, I own them. There's always a time that they can be done. I own a Western, which is the best Western I've read, which was written 1980 by a very good writer who passed away in COVID. We [contacted] his estate and said, “Can I buy the script?” So I own it. And if you're going to do a Western, for me, it can't be about towns and saloons and batwing doors and reeling lines with a whip — you know, cow catching and shit like that. I mean, that's not my kind of Western. It has to be about the Indigenous people and the trappers or the men who wander through the plains from minus 40 degrees to 110 and live their life having to evolve around the Indigenous people. So it's that, and it's so fundamental. It's absolutely great.

 










Is that a Cormac McCarthy adaptation, or something else?

No, I did one thing with Cormac McCarthy, which I think is one of my best films, but it's too dark. It's called “The Counselor.” If you are a writer, I think it might appeal because the dialogue of Cormac is phenomenal, and I fell in love with it. You know we made that film for $32 million with that cast? It speaks for Cormac. I read it and went, “Whoa!” And I started making phone calls, and I had everyone cast by noon.

Thank you so much for your time. Can you tell me the name of that Western that you wanted to make?

No.

The director's cut of “Kingdom of Heaven” is now available on 4K Blu-ray.

The most beautiful and dangerous thing about parent-child relationships is that they're always changing, even as the love that holds them in place never does. 

It's beautiful, of course, that newly widowed horse mom Kate (Julianne Moore) would still do anything for her precious Claire (Sydney Sweeney, raw enough to plow through some very goofy dialogue), even though the once-adoring little girl has matured into a shrieky, manipulative drug addict who now sees her mom as a hindrance to scoring heroin. The danger there, as we see over the course of Michael Pearce's luridly enjoyable “Echo Valley,” is that doing “anything” for her full-grown junkie daughter requires a very different kind of commitment from Kate than it did when Claire was a kid. Back in the day it probably just meant buying her a pony for their farm. Now it means dumping her boyfriend's dead body in the nearest lake so that Claire won't go to jail for “accidentally” bashing his brains in with a rock. The contract is the same, but the terms have grown a bit more complicated.

 








Related Stories Does ‘Materialists' Satisfy as a Romance? Screen Talk Debates Celine Song's Film, Shares ‘F1' First Reactions ‘I Don't Understand You' Review: Nick Kroll and Andrew Rannells Kill It in Grisly Destination Rom-Com 

Scripted by “Mare of Easttown” writer Brad Ingelsby, and soaked in a similar fear of white suburban rot, this protean Apple TV+ thriller works best when it operates by the same principle. The first half of the film seems to shift into a different genre every few minutes; what starts as a chilly grief drama about a depressed New Jersey lesbian who can't pay her farm bills — to the great annoyance of her rich landowner ex-husband, played by a fiery Kyle MacLachlan in a one-scene cameo that feels like an unresolved parenthetical — sours into a Cassavetes-loud heartwrencher when Claire shows up at her mother's door in desperate need of help. 

 










But that vibe — and the domestic violence that comes with it — lasts just long enough to set up a very different sort of movie. You see, Claire thought it would be funny to throw her “fuckface” boyfriend's stuff off a local bridge, but she failed to realize that $10,000 of his dealer's heroin was bundled up inside of it. Womp womp. Now the couple has to come up with the money themselves, or Jackie is going to kill them both (he's played by a scummy as hell Domhnall Gleeson, who predictably delights in a role that allows him to subvert the inherent kindness of his demeanor). And as if that weren't bad enough, the stakes get raised even higher when Claire returns to the horse farm a few days later covered in her boyfriend's blood and crying for her mommy.

Not only will Kate do anything to help, but — suddenly endowed with the sort of preternatural confidence that some parents are able to muster from the worst of their panic — she also seems to know exactly how to do it. Moore has always displayed a rare gift for revealing her characters' inner strength by allowing us to watch them unravel (see: the pharmacy scene in “Magnolia”), and she conveys so much about the ineffable weight of motherhood through Kate's wounded but unflinching reaction to the crisis that Claire lays at her feet. No joke: There was a brief stretch of this story where I thought it might turn out that Kate used to kill people for a living, but “retired assassin forced back into the game” is one of the few sub-genres that “Echo Valley” doesn't entertain.

 










“It must be fucking awful having a kid like that,” Jackie snarls to her at one point. “Always having to clean up their shit.” But a sociopath like him could never understand that “having to clean up someone's shit” can be the most affirming obligation this world has to offer, even if that shit is a lot messier than any parent would ever want for their child. 

That's why “Echo Valley” is at its richest and most self-possessed during the fleeting moments when it seems like dumping a body at the bottom of a lake might be the magic bullet that brings these two women back together again. The unconditionality of Kate's love for her daughter is put to the test, and — grim as the circumstances of that test might be — there's something inescapably tender about how Kate passes it with flying colors. In the absence of her late wife, and the unfortunate proximity of her sniveling ex-husband, Kate can't help but exalt in the purity of the affection she'll always have for Claire. 

Alas, Pearce (“Beast,” “Encounter”) does better with ambivalent threats than he does with emotional openness, and Ingelsby's script is too eager to shift into yet another different gear for “Echo Valley” to kindle any lasting warmth from its mother-daughter murder duo. Opting to embrace an increasingly soapy and sordid crime saga at the exact moment when it should be growing closer to its characters, the movie fatally diverts its attention from the unconditional love between them. At first it seems as if the story is pivoting to focus on the imbalance of that relationship, but Claire soon disappears from the picture entirely, leaving Kate to clean up the mess with Jackie by herself. 

 










There's some fun to be had in watching “Echo Valley” shift into a battle of wits between Moore and Gleeson, as both actors mine devious nuance from the thin gruel of a paperback thriller (though I was just as amused by the movie's growing reliance on Apple software, and by whatever corporate machinations led to Verizon getting a shoutout instead of AT&T). But “Echo Valley” loses its reason for being as soon as its self-impressed third act decides to focus on Kate's resourcefulness at the expense of her emotional responsibility. 

This movie can get away with murder so long as it's about a mother turning into a master criminal because her daughter is in danger — a perfect summer riff on the concept of a parent who finds the strength to lift a car when it rolls over their child. It's only when Kate becomes the subject of Jackie's ire that “Echo Valley” blunders away the source of its power. Without that unconditional love to hold it together, this movie's volatile changes can't help but obscure the essence of a story about what it really means for some things to always stay the same. 

“Echo Valley” is now playing in select theaters. It will be available to stream on Apple TV+ starting Friday, June 13.

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	Pair stars like Julianne Moore and Sydney Sweeney, add BAFTA-winning director Michael Pearce and a top screenwriter of, among others, the Emmy-winning Mare of Easttown in Brad Ingelsby and major producers including Ridley Scott and it is not a surprise that they have collectively cooked up one barnburner of a thriller. And the “barnburner” part you can take literally.


	It is called Echo Valley and will begin streaming on Apple TV+ on June 13, but this could do well in theaters (it supposedly will play in a select few). Nevertheless, it is gripping stuff no matter how you find it.

	











	Moore, in fine form, plays Kate, divorced and now estranged from her ex-husband Richard (Kyle MacLachlan, in all too briefly) and grieving the loss of her wife, also has to deal with an on-and-off relationship with volatile daughter Claire (Sydney Sweeney), who is running with the wrong crowd and hopelessly addicted to drugs. Kate has been doing everything she can to help her and get her back on track. But she is broke thanks to Claire's travails, and even resorts to begging her ex for money to fix her Echo Valley Farm roof which is one storm away from caving in.




			Watch on Deadline		







	To make ends meet she boards horses and gives riding lessons, but it is not enough. Claire has a run-in when her bad-news boyfriend Ryan (Edmund Donovan) shows up with his petty criminal drug dealer Jackie Lyman (Domhnall Gleeson), the latter strong-arming her and demanding the return of a case with drugs that she unknowingly tossed over a bridge during a fight with Ryan. He demands $10,000 until Kate discovers the altercation and kicks him out. After hysterically trying to force money from her mother, Claire takes off. Things don't go well from there and when she finally returns, a mess with blood all over her, Kate asks what happened. Turns out another encounter with Ryan and Jackie ended violently and Kate confesses she accidentally killed Ryan. “Did you go to the police?” her mother asks. “No,” she replies.

	











	At this moment what is a mother who has lost everything going to do with the daughter, no matter how difficult, who is all she has left? “Where's the body?” Kate asks. From this point on hang on to your seat because you will be jumping out of it due to the myriad twists and turns this wild ride takes us on.


	Ingelsby is an exceptional storyteller and has provided a real crackerjack of a thriller with this premise that also examines family dynamics and just how much is too much unconditional love of a mother for her child. For a while I was thinking this is all a great advertisement against ever having kids, and it is only because Moore is just so exceptional in this kind of harrowing situation that you believe she would go as far as she does indeed go for the sake of saving Claire from herself. Echo Valley is the perfect match for someone of Moore's prodigious talents, a role requiring physicality, strong emotions and belief this is a woman with more than one trick up her sleeve to survive and keep what is left of her family together. Sweeney goes for it too, a true powder keg going off at any moment, and she makes Claire into one humdinger of a problem. In Sweeney's hands you can see someone believably falling under the spell of such a dead-end lover, but you just want to lock her up and throw away the key. The dynamic, ever-changing and charged between the two, is palpable.


	Into all this comes Jackie Lyman, and I had no idea it was Gleeson who totally transforms into this creepy little small-time monster who terrorizes Claire, and then most memorably Kate (there are shades of Max Cady from Cape Fear here). Gleeson delivers one of the more convincing bad dude turns in recent years, evil personified but a guy who thinks he is much smarter than he really is. You just hate Jackie, but Gleeson you cannot take you eyes off whenever he is on screen. Among the rest of the cast, Fiona Shaw is excellent as the grounding best friend who tries to calm an increasingly troubled Kate. There is also fine work from Albert Jones as a police detective and Donovan as the loser boyfriend.


	Pearce's slick production is aided immeasurably by Benjamin Kracun's first-rate cinematography and the superb atmospheric production design from Keith P. Cunningham.


	Producers are Ridley Scott, Michael Pruss, Kevin J. Walsh and Ingelsby.

Billy Joel reveals that he twice attempted suicide — sparked by his affair with a band mate's wife — in his new HBO documentary And So It Goes, and that one of the attempts left him in a coma.


	Before he was “The Piano Man,” a twentysomething Joel played in a Long Island hard rock band called Attila alongside his then-best friend Jon Small. At one point, Joel moved in with Small, his wife Elizabeth Weber, and their young son, during which Joel and Weber spent “a lot of time together” and a “slow build” romance developed. Joel eventually admitted to Small, “I'm in love with your wife.” 


	“I felt very, very guilty about it. They had a child. I felt like a homewrecker,” Joel said in the documentary, according to People. “I was just in love with a woman, and I got punched in the nose, which I deserved. Jon was very upset. I was very upset.”


	The affair resulted in Attila's breakup, the (temporary) end of his best friendship, and Joel getting evicted from Small's house. “I had no place to live. I was sleeping in laundromats and I was depressed, I think to the point of almost being psychotic,” Joel added. “So I figured, ‘That's it. I don't want to live anymore.' I was just in a lot of pain, and it was sort of like, ‘Why hang out? Tomorrow is going to be just like today is and today sucks.' So, I just thought I'd end it all.”

	Joel's sister Judy, then a medical assistant, had previously prescribed her brother sleeping pills to help him sleep; Joel's first suicide attempt came when he “decided that he was going to take them all.”

	











	“He was in a coma for days and days and days,” Judy says in the documentary. “I went to go see him in the hospital, and he was lying there white as a sheet. I thought that I'd killed him.”


	Joel, disappointed that his attempt failed, woke up in the hospital and swore to do it “right” the second time. He said he drank an entire bottle of the cleaning product “lemon Pledge,” after which his ex-best friend, Small, took him to the hospital. “Even though our friendship was blowing up, Jon saved my life,” Joel said.


	Small added in the documentary, “He never really said anything to me, the only practical answer I can give as to why Billy took it so hard was because he loved me that much and that it killed him to hurt me that much. Eventually I forgave him.”


	Following that attempt, Joel entered himself into an observation ward for a few weeks, a decision that changed the trajectory of his life. “I got out of the observation ward, and I thought to myself, you can utilize all those emotions to channel that stuff into music,” Joel said.

	A postscript to the affair: Joel and Weber eventually reunited, and the pair wedded. The marriage lasted from 1973 to 1982.


And So It Goes premiered Wednesday at the Tribeca Film Festival, with Joel unable to attend the screening due to his recent brain disorder diagnosis. The singer, however, did send a message via the filmmakers: “Getting old sucks, but it's preferable to getting cremated.”

Darren Aronofsky is supporting the documentation of the Israel-Palestine conflict: The auteur produces award-winning feature “Holding Liat,” directed by Brandon Kramer. “Holding Liat” tells the story of Liat Beinin-Atzili, an Israeli-American woman who was taken hostage by Hamas alongside her husband Aviv on October 7, 2023. Liat and Aviv have been held captive in Gaza with 250 other people, 12 of whom, like Liat, are American citizens.

The film details how Liat's parents, sister, and children had to navigate the American political landscape to try to get her released. The official synopsis reads: “Caught between international diplomacy and a rapidly escalating war, their family must face their own uncertainty and conflicting perspectives in the pursuit of Liat and Aviv's release. This agonizing process, and the ultimate fate of their loved ones, challenges how the members of the family understand themselves and their place in the conflict.Through the intimate lens of a family's experience, ‘Holding Liat' poses complex questions of identity across generations, as the family is thrust into the epicenter of a global conflict rapidly unfolding in real-time.”

“Holding Liat” is an independent production of Aronofsky's Protozoa and Meridian Hill Pictures. The film was a Berlinale documentary award winner and will make its North American premiere at Tribeca 2025. Liat and her family will attend Tribeca screenings and answer audiences questions during the festival.

Director Kramer is actually related to Liat, and knew he had to tell her story onscreen. “This film represents the greatest challenge of my career: it's a deeply personal chronicle of my extended family's intimate experiences, set against the larger Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which continues to impact so many people's lives,” Kramer told IndieWire. “Our team carefully considered the film's rollout, which kicked off with sold-out screenings at the Berlinale – where it was recognized with the Documentary Film Award – and subsequent international premieres in Hong Kong, Brazil, Croatia, Poland, and Israel.” Kramer continued, “As American filmmakers, with a film largely shot in the U.S., the North American premiere is a significant opportunity to reach audiences who are yearning for humane and nuanced storytelling, especially around the complex issues explored in the film. After premiering our last film ‘The First Step' at Tribeca in 2021, it's an honor to return this year with ‘Holding Liat.' We are deeply grateful to Tribeca and our subsequent hometown premiere at DC/DOX for bringing this story to American audiences in a moment that feels more urgent than ever.” 

In a director's statement, Kramer cited how the international conflict is still sadly enduring. “More than a year after October 7, lives are still imperiled: with hostages still held, tens of thousands of Palestinians killed, and people across the region suffering,” he said. “Our conversations about all these issues have only become more polarized, even within communities and families. By telling an intimate story of one directly impacted family, and the way they navigated differences amongst each other, we hope to open up new possibilities for understanding this conflict, and contribute to an end to the unrelenting violence in the region. We are keenly aware that this film is just one family's story out of countless others, and that many important stories may tragically never be told. We hope through the family's resilience and openness, alongside other Israeli and Palestinian films that seek to broaden understanding, audiences will find room to ask deeper questions that help mark a path toward healing and reconciliation.” 

“Holding Liat” is produced by Aronofsky, Justin A. Gonçalves, Lance Kramer, Ari Handel, and Yoni Brook. Aronofsky also has his “Underland” nature documentary, directed by Robert Petit, at Tribeca.

Rose Byrne knew she was fated to bring the story of Amanda Ogle to the screen. Byrne stars in “Tow,” based on Ogle's story as an unhoused woman fighting to reclaim her car from a predatory towing company after it refuses to return her stolen vehicle.

“Tow” is premiering at Tribeca 2025 on ​Saturday, June 7. Byrne leads the ensemble cast, which also includes Oscar winners Octavia Spencer and Ariana DeBose, plus Demi Lovato, Elsie Fisher, and “The Holdovers” breakout Dominic Sessa. Stephanie Laing directs from a script written by Brant Boivin and Jonathan Keasey.

 










“It was so moving and wildly original and timely,” Bryne told IndieWire about first learning about the film. “It is a timely tale right now to tell. I am so proud we are bringing Amanda's story to audiences. The fall into being unhoused is full of such assumption, prejudice, and ignorance from people. This tells a story of how it can happen to anyone, and hopefully, in a way that is not like homework but entertaining and moving. She is a character with such fight, humor, and spirit, and I feel the audience will root for her to win.”

Director Laing was determined to have Byrne portray Ogle in the feature, especially after watching her performance on Apple TV+ series “Physical” while on set. “She has such depth and handles tricky tones with a delicate touch,” Laing said of the “If I Had Legs I'd Kick You” star. “Rose disappears in this role. She's also the queen of micro-expressions.”

“Tow” was filmed in only 19 days and for “very little money,” as “Friends and Neighbors” director Laing told IndieWire. “It was a true indie filmmaking process,” she said. “It's a great way to stretch yourself creatively, going from TV to indie films.”

The star-studded cast also made filming easy: “Working with Octavia [Spencer] was a dream,” Laing said. “She was our guiding light. I think Ariana's performance brings the levity and she's funny as hell but those dramatic moments really hit hard. Dominic is such a star and his instincts in the way he played Kevin were spot on. He had a different walk and the he held his hands. I was very lucky to have this cast. And let's not forget to talk about how nice it is to see Simon Rex, also playing opposite of what we've seen him do in the last [‘Blink Twice']. Everyone really came to play and crushed it. And Demi Lovato was fearless.” 

As “Tow” gets ready to speed off into the world, Laing hopes that audiences resonate with Ogle's crusade as much as she did. “When I first read the script I knew I had to tell Amanda's story,” Laing said. “She's tenacious and a fighter. I hope audiences walk away feeling hopeful. In many ways this is a film about being stuck in a broken system with very high stakes. Amanda never gave up. I hope that none of us do, when we need to fight for what is right and just in the world. I also hope we can be more kind. Start there, remember kindness.”

	In a new interview with Rolling Stone, Eric Church says he was once roped into a Taylor Swift copyright lawsuit after the superstar mentioned his song during a deposition.


	Back in 2017, Swift was sued by the songwriters behind 3LW's “Playas Gon' Play” for using the lyrics “players gonna play, haters gonna hate” in her hit “Shake It Off.” The lawsuit sparked a years-long legal battle that was ultimately voluntarily dismissed in late 2022. But during her deposition months earlier, Swift claimed she first knew of the lyric from Church's song “The Outsiders.”


	“In her deposition, when [talking about the line] ‘players gonna play, haters gonna hate,' she says, ‘The first time I heard that phrase was in Eric Church's song ‘The Outsiders,”” Church said in the Rolling Stone Interview. “She was saying she never heard it on the [original song], which is what they were suing her for. And two weeks later, I got served by the people that were suing her!”


	Specifically, Swift had said she had “heard the phrases ‘players gonna play' and ‘haters gonna hate' uttered countless times to express the idea that one should shrug off negativity,” and had referred to the Church track.

	











	“I sent her a text, and she responded,” Church recounted. “I was like, ‘Hey, thanks. Next time, let's just skip that part?' And she sent me a text: ‘I'm sorry. It's the truth, though. That's when I first heard that phrase.'”


	He added, about his own case: “It's since been settled. But I was like, ‘How did this even happen?'”

	











	Swift and the two songwriters who accused her of copyright infringement on “Shake It Off” agreed to dismiss the lawsuit a month before it was set to head to trial in December 2022. The filings did not include any reason for the agreement to dismiss the case, but it started in 2017 after Sean Hall and Nathan Butleer sued Swift in 2017 for allegedly taking the line from “Playas Gon' Play.”

	Last week, Swift successfully gained control of her recorded music catalog six years after her old label, Big Machine Label Group, sold it to Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings. Church, meanwhile, is currently performing around Nashville during CMA Fest. On Thursday, he made a surprise appearance at Spotify House, performing hits like “Springsteen” and supporting his latest album, Evangeline vs. the Machine.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


FRIDAY AM UPDATE, after exclusive: Lionsgate is reporting $3.75M for the previews to Thunder Road's John Wick spinoff Ballerina. That number is from Wednesday and Thursday shows.


	The Rotten Tomatoes audience score stands at 93%, equal to 2023's John Wick: Chapter 4‘s which is best in the Keanu Reeves franchise.


Ballerina‘s audience score also is higher than previous solo femme action movies Furiosa (88%, 2024) and Alita: Battle Angel (91%, 2019).


	Exits on PostTrak were excellent Thursday night with a 79% definite recommend. Again, that's the fans, but it speaks volumes; we've said this before, but with the Comscore/Screen Engine polling service, “definite recommend” carries more weight than the positivity score which is 87%, still very good. This should bode well for Ballerina prancing past $30M. Men showed up to the guns-blazing ballet Thursday night at 61%. Best definite recommend and positive scores came from women over 25, who showed up at 29% and gave it an 83% and 90%, respectively.

Ballerina takes place during the events of John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum and follows orphaned Eve Macarro (Ana de Armas), who is beginning her training in the assassin traditions of the Ruska Roma. Her father died at the hands of Gabriel Bryne's The Chancellor. She's as mad as hell, and she's not going to take it anymore.

	Social media org RelishMix says: “Convo on Ballerina is running positive for action fans excited to see one of their favorite franchises expand in glorious fashion. The cast is the cause of a lot of the film's positive sentiments including Ana de Armas, who has gained a lot of good will in other roles, and the promise of a returning Keanu Reeves as John Wick. Some comments are, ‘I love Ana de Armas, and I'm so excited to see her doing this kind of film after No Time to Die. She was the best Bond Girl!' and ‘I didn't actually expect Keanu to show up in the movie, glad he is gonna be in it!' plus, ‘Did I spy Norman Reedus? Between Ian McShane, Keanu, and the legendary Mr. Lance Reddick‘. Many are pleased with the direction of this film and the action spotlighted in the trailer, sharing, ‘I was wondering if they were going to do a spinoff with the dancers! This looks EPIC!!!' and, ‘I really hope that this is the start of a trilogy.'”

	











	RelishMix also notes that Reedus has the most social media followers from the Ballerina cast with his activated 19.2M, and de Armas has 15M fans, while Reeves is still off the grid for his movies.


	And as we told you Thursday night, it was imminent that Disney's Lilo & Stitch would cross $300M at 4,410 theaters, the second movie to do so YTD at the domestic B.O. after Warner Bros/Legendary's A Minecraft Movie. The hybrid/live-action feature take on the 2002 Disney toon made $5M Thursday, -7% from Wednesday, for a second week of $86.1M and a running total of $303.1M. Lilo & Stitch is expected to reign again with a third weekend of $35M.

	Rest of the top five for the week is as follows:


	2.) Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning (Par) 3,861 theaters, Thu $2.3M (-10% from Wed), Wk $38.9M (-59%), Total $134.2M/Wk 2


	3.) Karate Kid: Legends (Sony) 3,809 theaters, Thu $1.2M (-10%), Wk $26.7M, Wk 1


	4.) Final Destination Bloodlines (NL) 3,134 theaters, Thu $1.M (-11%), Wk $16.1M (-48%), Total $117M, Wk 3


	5.) Bring Her Back (A24) 2,449 theaters, Thu $675K (-12%), Wk $10.4M, Wk 1 


EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us tonight that the John Wick spinoff Ballerina is looking to do around $3.5M-$4M in previews. That's all in, including Wednesday fan screenings that started at 7 p.m. as well as Thursday showtimes that began at 6 p.m.


	The hope is that the $80M-$90M Lionsgate production gets to north of $30M, which, as we told you, is around where recent female solo action movies openings live at the box office, read Furiosa ($26.3M 3-day last year) and 2019's Alita: Battle Angel ($28.5M 3-day in 2019).


	The Len Wiseman-directed spinoff produced by Thunder Road is expected to rank second behind Disney's third weekend of Lilo & Stitch, which is looking to make around $35M; that movie crosses $300M today.


Ballerina was delayed a year to undergo additional photography.  


	Upside on Ballerina is that Thursday night fans are enjoying the Ana de Armas movie with a Keanu Reeves cameo, giving a 94% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes — as of this minute, that's higher than any John Wick RT popcorn score; John Wick: Chapter 4 received a 93% in 2023. Critically, even though Ballerina is 72% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, it's not as high as the John Wick movies, which had film review scores ranging from 86%-94% certified fresh.


Ballerina‘s all-in preview cash is on par with the Thursday preview box office of Furiosa ($3.5M) and higher than the $2.4M Tuesday night preview cash of Alita: Battle Angel. Essentially, the thinking is to comp Ballerina to female solo action movies instead of John Wick movies. Female solo action movies are a completely different subgenre and don't always attract the full-on male audience that typically attends an action movie with a male leading star.


	Still, Ballerina‘s combined preview cash is higher than the Thursday night of 2017's John Wick 2 ($2.2M) but far under both 2019's John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum ($5.9M, ) and 2023's John Wick: Chapter 4 ($8.9M, best preview cash in franchise).


	We'll have more updates as they happen Friday morning. Lionsgate didn't return our request for comment.

Daron Malakian has strong opinions about what's missing in heavy music today: danger and risk. “I think you have a generation of fans who are very easily offended,” he tells Rolling Stone. “Offensiveness and shock should not be taken away from rock music in general.”


	Those qualities are inherent in “Killing Spree,” the bloodthirsty first single off Addicted to the Violence, the new album from Daron Malakian and Scars on Broadway, due out July 18. “Insanity/Controlling me,” he sings in the song's chorus, “Society/The kids are on a killing spree.” Built on manic, strobing guitars and undulating waves of distortion, the music feels both cutting and brutalizing. “It's gonna feel like a Jesus comin' back,” he sings, stretching the last word heavenward with giddy, helium-like aplomb. “It's gonna feel like the devil's on the attack.”


	“I think the song ‘Killing Spree' is a subject that I don't think a lot of people want to touch,” Malakian, 49, says via email. “I don't care, I'll touch it because it exists. It's not to be shocking or offensive, but it exists, and that's what I'll write about if I want to. I'm not going to edit myself if someone is going to be offended. I think that's missing in heavy metal music.”

	











	He's reluctant to explain the song — “Your kids are on a killing spree, so your kids have something to do with it,” he says vaguely — partially because he doesn't see anything controversial about the subject matter of killing sprees. “We live in a world, and things happen in this world, and killing sprees are one of those things that I've seen happen kind of often in the last 15 years or so — but I actually wrote the song way before that,” he says. Moreover, he looks at the song as commentary more than a transgressive statement. “It's not for or against anything,” he says. “It just is.”

	











	These days, Malakian says he just writes songs for the sake of it. As guitarist-singer for System of a Down, he's been keeping busy touring with them. Since that band has reached a creative stalemate, at least when it comes to making a new album (they did record a couple of songs a few years ago), he has been slowly working on a follow-up to the last Scars on Broadway album, Dictator, which came out in 2018. That album contained songs he had once hoped to record with System of a Down; Addicted to the Violence, he says, is more general.

	“At this point in my life, I don't write any songs for System or for Scars,” he says. “I just write songs. I think if System was making an album, some of those songs would probably end up on a System album, but System does not make albums these days, so they go to Scars.”


	Malakian had recorded Dictator as a distraction from “some personal things going on with my family and my life,” so he recorded a bunch of songs in the space of two weeks, doing everything himself, from the vocals and guitars to the drums. Addicted to the Violence has been a more considered affair that found him collaborating on songwriting with his friend, multi-instrumentalist Orbel Babayan, drummer Roman Lomtadze, and saxophonist Matthew “Narducci” Silberman.


	“This album probably took me longer than any album I've ever made to decide it was done,” Malakian says. “On this one, I did more home demos, recorded some stuff at home, picked the songs in my rolodex of songs that were like, ‘Let's record this one, see how it goes.'”

	Scars on Broadway first recorded the songs at Malakian's home, but it didn't sound right, so they went to a studio, recutting everything but the vocals. He estimates it took close to two years to get everything the way he wanted it. “I was in no rush,” he says. “I'm never in any rush. I'm sure people who like what I do realize I don't put out an album every year. … That's just my process.”


	So will people be able to hear these songs in a concert setting? “I have plans to play live, but I don't have any tours scheduled or anything like that,” he says. “But I definitely have plans to play live.”

After getting serious on Sincere, Khalid is ready to have fun again.


													By
												

	Richard Trapunski



TikTok is a time machine. Hearing his songs on the app, Khalid finds himself in an earlier era.  


	Last February, the Billboard Hot 100-topping R&B and pop artist noticed one of his early hits was resurfacing. “Location” — which peaked at No. 16 in 2017 — was connecting with listeners all over again, who were singing along to the yearning lyrics about love in the digital age with a fresh perspective.  


	“It's a whole new society, a whole new age of young adults who are experiencing this song,” Khalid says. “I lived it, and I performed it, but to see people who are now the age I was then listening to that song, it's surreal, funny and nostalgic. It makes me live vicariously through that experience. I'm like, wow, there's a reason why it resonates with them: because that was real.” 


	When he first wrote the song, Khalid was a teenager himself. A 17-year-old living in El Paso, Texas, he uploaded the track to SoundCloud without ever considering the impact the now-diamond-certified song might one day have on young lovelorn listeners a decade later.  

	











	“Turning 27 this year came with a lot of reflection on life,” he says. “I started to look back at where I was when I was 17. To be able to be in my career for as long as I have, to still have an impact, even to see things going viral on TikTok — I feel like that version of me 10 years ago would be so proud and so happy. And if you had told him all of [what would happen in the next 10 years]?” he says with a chuckle. “He wouldn't have had a clue.” 

	











	Now fully cemented as an in-demand collaborator, global arena artist and reliably charting hit-maker, Khalid is ready to rediscover the innocent version of himself that he was before he found success.  


	He wants to be the most open and honest version of himself — not necessarily the serious and emotional version  Khalid spent years of his life pouring into 2024's Sincere, but one that is able to relax because he has fully embraced his own identity.  


	“Not just my moody side, but the fun side,” he says. “The flirty side.” 


Though Sincere was a deeply personal album, there was one part of himself Khalid hadn't quite revealed yet.  


	In November 2024, Khalid was outed by an ex-boyfriend. Though it's not how he wanted to share that part of his identity with his fans, with a simple rainbow emoji he confirmed that he is gay and “not ashamed of [his] sexuality.'” 


	He was never hiding anything, he says, just protecting that part of his privacy. Stepping back onstage and seeing the reaction from his fans reaffirmed his open and honest approach to music. 


	“I had a moment where I walked out and I looked into the crowd, and I'm singing these songs that — I was obviously gay when I wrote them, but the world may not have known,” he recounts. “Everybody is singing them the same way they were before I was outed! So [that shows me] none of my fans care about my sexual preferences. I think they care about our mutual respect for music.” 


	He realized he didn't have to keep finding ways to protect his privacy. It was a liberating experience, he says, seeing that very little had changed.  


	“Finding that freedom comes from knowing I can just be myself and still be embraced and appreciated,” he says. “That doesn't change because the world finds out I'm gay. Because I don't change because the world finds out I'm gay.” 

	











	Though artists express themselves through their music, the songs live their own lives. Once they're out in the world, fans can project their own feelings and experiences onto them. In some ways, the music belongs to the listener as much as the artist.


	After he came out, a fan pointed out that his 2022 song “Satellite” was already “an LGBTQ anthem.” In addition, “Better” has been used as a first dance at multiple weddings, and the 2017 song “Young Dumb & Broke” has become a staple at graduations. As listeners find meaning in the music, it takes on its own dimensions.  


	“When you're an artist, you carry a responsibility,” Khalid says. “People will live to your music, people will die to your music, people will give birth, people will be reborn. There's so much emotion involved in the exchange of music from artists to listeners.” 


	He uses “Young Dumb & Broke” as an example. The song's universal experience of the feeling of invincibility of life in your teenage years has persisted from one generation to the next, which is something he would not have predicted.  


	“ ‘Young Dumb & Broke' lasting as long as it has now would have never been anything I imagined, because when I made that song, I was so presently focused on being young, dumb and broke,” he says. “When I was singing that song at 19, I probably would have told you that I couldn't wait to stop singing that song. Now, I love it.” 


	Khalid says he wants to inspire young Black men to be comfortable being open about their sexuality, but he doesn't see the music as appealing to any specific kind of listener because of the identity of the person making it.  


	“Music is subjective,” he says. “If you place yourself in an experience, we can relate to people all across the board. It doesn't matter if you're gay, it doesn't matter if you're straight. We all have feelings and we all have emotions.” 

	











Khalid is a major star of the streaming era. He has multiple songs in Spotify's Billions Club (tracks with 1 billion streams), including “Location,” “Young Dumb & Broke” and “Lovely,” his collaboration with Billie Eilish. At his 2019 streaming peak, he spent some time as the most popular artist on the platform. 


	When he first started, though, those platforms were barely on his radar. Instead, he uploaded his first songs to SoundCloud, the streaming site where users once shared their own music and mixtapes — a popular platform for new musicians. There was very little thought to strategy or rollout.  


	“Naturally, that led to other apps like YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music and so on. But that's where it all started,” he recalls. “I remember being on the phone with a friend, like, ‘I'm about to upload my song to the internet.' It felt so carefree back then — just making songs with my friends and throwing them online. Nobody could have imagined what streaming would become today.” 


	Though he couldn't have predicted it, Khalid was uniquely positioned for the streaming era. He's often categorized as an R&B singer, but he has a genre fluidity that has landed him on a diverse number of Billboard charts: Adult Contemporary, Latin, Rock & Alternative, Rap, Dance. He has a song for every playlist.  


	As a child, Khalid's parents were in the Army and he often found himself moving around. He spent six years living in Germany when he was young, then spent some of his formative teen years from eighth grade until just before his senior year in upstate New York, just 20 minutes from the Canadian border.


	“Being a military kid, I was like a sponge, just soaking in all the cultures around me,” he recounts. “When I was in northern New York, I got introduced to American folk music, which became a big part of my foundation as an artist and really shaped my songwriting. Then living in Germany exposed me to pop music from a different perspective. And coming from the South, R&B is definitely at my core. So all these different shades of music come together to make who I am.” 


	He'd moved to El Paso by the time he released his breakout 2017 debut album, American Teen, but it was inspired by his experiences growing up both there and at Fort Drum, just outside of Watertown, N.Y. Like so many other teenagers growing up outside of a major city, he spent a lot of time bored or partying — and dabbling in music.   

	











	“A lot of the stories that ended up inspiring American Teen came from that time in my life,” he recalls. “It was cold and kind of bleak, with not a whole lot to do — but there were definitely a lot of parties. At the time, it was fun and wild. Looking back now as an adult, I'm like, ‘Why did you get yourself into some of those situations?' But honestly, it was the perfect setting for teenage angst — just growing up, facing challenges and mentally taking notes.” 


	His mother was restationed to El Paso before his senior year of high school, and he decided to go with her. Lonely and separated from his friends, he began writing songs and uploading them online. At the time, Right Hand Co.'s Courtney Stewart was managing a number of producers when he was introduced to Khalid through mutual friends on Twitter and heard some of his SoundCloud demos. 


	“He didn't know it at the time, but he was writing a generational album in American Teen,” Stewart says. “As soon as I heard that voice and those lyrics, I was like, ‘This is incredible.' It was something I had never heard before. His tone, the youthfulness of the lyrics and just how it made me feel. So I got on a plane and went and met with him.” (Khalid's management team now includes Stewart, Mame Diagne, Jordan Holly and Relvyn Lopez at Right Hand.) 


	Other artists and producers have heard the same thing in his music. His ability to adapt to different sounds and his breadth of universal experiences has made him an ideal collaborator for everyone from J Balvin to Marshmello to Logic to Halsey.  

	











	Growing up near the Canadian border may also have endeared him to artists from the country. He's collaborated with a number of Canadian artists, including Majid Jordan, Tate McRae, Shawn Mendes, Alessia Cara and Justin Bieber. He's also made a big impact in the country, with 40 songs charting on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100.  


	Khalid says he loves collaborating, which brings the best attributes of two sounds together. Having another voice in the room can also let him get out of his own head, he says, and recognize when a song is a hit.  


	Most importantly, he's sure enough in his own voice that no matter the genre he's working in or the artist he's performing with, he's still recognizably Khalid.  


	“I think not losing sight and just trusting my voice has led me to be in any sound comfortably because I get to pull up as myself,” he says. “When you feel yourself on a track, you can't fake it. It's real.”


Being rather private, Khalid worries he's created an impression of himself as an introverted person. Now, he's ready to bust that myth. 

	











	“I'm actually extremely extroverted,” he says. “I love to socialize, I love to hang out, I love to see new things and meet new people. I mean, my [2019] album was called Free Spirit, but I really do believe I am one. I made that album only to go into hiding afterward. I don't feel like that's very much freedom. But now, I feel like I do have my freedom.” 


	Embracing his full self has brought him back to the carefree headspace of his SoundCloud days — but with the experience and maturity of an established music career.  


	“I started off just having fun and when I gained a career, I started to take myself a little too seriously,” he admits. “I had my fair share of time to be serious. Now I don't have a care in the world. I can just have fun.” 


	In a recently posted TikTok clip, Khalid is vibing to a snippet of an unreleased song on the streets of Manhattan. In a black hoodie and throwback raver pants and holding a black handbag, he dances along to a track that blends his signature mellow, wise-beyond-his-years vocals with a sound that evokes decadent early-2000s pop by Britney Spears or The Pussycat Dolls. Grinning ear to ear, he stops to take a quick photo with a fan. It takes only 15 seconds to see the comfort and excitement of his new chapter. 


	“My new era of music feels like I'm finally ready to be the artist I've always dreamt of being,” he says. “It goes back to the regressions of when I was a child — imagining myself and thinking, ‘I want to be this artist one day.' Now I feel like I have the confidence to finally be that artist.”

EXCLUSIVE: Mubi has acquired rights to Hal & Harper, the acclaimed indie TV series from actor-filmmaker Cooper Raiff (Cha Cha Real Smooth), for streaming in the U.S. and France, on the heels of its premiere at this year's Sundance Film Festival. The eight-episode family drama, co-starring Lili Reinhart and Mark Ruffalo, will premiere exclusively on the service this fall.


	Lionsgate financed the series, handled the sale and distributes it worldwide.


	This marks another win for independently produced television at a time when the business model is still being tested. Other recent examples of indie series that have gone on to significant streaming deals include Shane Gillis' hit comedy Tires, which just returned for a second season, as well as Mark Duplass' Penelope, both of which wound up at Netflix.

	











Hal & Harper marks the latest acquisition in a notable expansion into series this year for Mubi, following recent acquisitions of Joe Wright's Mussolini: Son of the Century and Wong Kar Wai's Blossoms Shanghai, across multiple territories. Upcoming, Mubi will also be releasing David Lynch and Mark Frost's Twin Peaks (1990) and Twin Peaks: A Limited Event Series (2017) in the U.S. and other select territories starting June 13, in honor of the franchise's 35th anniversary.  




			Watch on Deadline		







	Recently screening at France's Series Mania, where Reinhart won the award for Best Actress, Hal & Harper will next make its New York premiere at the 2025 Tribeca Festival on June 8.

	











	The show centers on two codependent siblings Hal (Raiff) and Harper (Reinhart), who are facing big life changes. The pair's intimacy is built on a lifetime of inside jokes and shared pains, portrayed via flashbacks where Raiff and Reinhart play the elementary school-aged versions of themselves. As their father, Ruffalo's charm belies a chasm of guilt, which is at the root of all that Hal & Harper is trying to uncover.


	Created and directed by Raiff, the show also stars Betty Gilpin (GLOW), Havana Rose Liu (Bottoms), Addison Timlin (Start Up), and Alyah Chanelle Scott (The Sex Lives of College Girls). Thomas Hartmann served as producer, with Raiff, Clementine Quittner, Reinhart, Daniel Lewis, and Addison Timli exec producing.


	Said Raiff in a statement to Deadline, “MUBI is the perfect home for our very specific family show. They're a singular platform that understands the art they're putting out. I am in awe of what they've done recently, and am excited to be a part of the family.”


	Raiff is represented by UTA, Black Bear, and Fusion Entertainment.

Livvy Dunne knows that she's not what people typically think of when they imagine a world-famous athlete. 


	The 22-year-old gymnast, whose legal name is Olivia Paige Dunne, grew a social media platform 8 million followers deep on TikTok — posting videos of her life, routine, and experiences as a gymnast at Louisiana State University. (In 2023, Dunne was featured on Rolling Stone's Creator List). The athlete, who was recently a cover star for the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, was part of the LSU gymnastic team that took home the 2024 Collegiate National Championship — the first in the school's history. But her presence on the national stage continues to grow, even as she announced her retirement from the sport in April 2025. Now no longer on the uneven bars, Dunne tells Rolling Stone that she's excited to see how she can spend her time post-college still advocating for women in sports. 


	“I'll always advocate for women's sports — they're so important,' she says. “I have a fund at LSU called the Livvy Fund, and it's to help provide NIL [name, image, likeness] deals for female student athletes. I'd like to expand that to other schools and keep helping women and educating them because it is harder for women to get NIL deals and to know what to do. Because there's not a lot of knowledge or opportunity in that area. That's so important to me.”

	In May, Dunne opened Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit Runway Show during Miami, Florida's Swim Week alongside athletes like Jordan Chiles and Ilona Maher. It was Dunne's first runway show, and even though she was nervous, she decided to fully lean into the performance — dropping down into a split at the end of the runway. 

	











	“I was so nervous that during rehearsal I walked down the wrong side of the runway,” Dunne says, laughing. “But whenever I get nervous, I just take a deep breath and smile, because that makes me feel my best. I actually had my Invisalign aligners in and then I went on the runway, had all the confidence in the world and dropped into a split. Because why not? Gymnastics will never leave me. I'll always be a gymnast at heart.”

	One of the things that Dunne feels even more passionate about is using her platform to call out bad behavior and harassment that female athletes often experience once they reach a certain level of fame. While fans were celebrating Dunne on the cover of Sports Illustrated, she posted that she was getting harassed by groups of middle aged men who would figure out her flight information and stalk her while she was in airports, following and yelling at her for an autograph. The experience has been echoed by other female sports stars, including Gabby Thomas, an Olympic gold-medalist for track and field. 


	“There's a line and it was being crossed. I mean, I love signing autographs for people. I never have a problem. But it's when somebody knows where you're going to be before you,” she says. “Sometimes they'll buy tickets to get through security to wait. It's a little uncomfortable for a female traveling alone, and a little creepy. So I think me speaking out about it and bringing it to light again was important because it was a bit out of hand.”

	And now that she's hung up her leotard, what's next? Dunne will continue to be an influencer, picking up deals with companies like Invisalign, while also helping fellow female athletes trying to grow in their sport and also take control of their own social media presences. 


	“My favorite thing about social media is the friendships that I've made,” she tells Rolling Stone. “Meeting other people that have the same passion as you and a similar drive is so fun. And the way that you can connect with people in different parts of the country, that's so special. It's changed my life.”

Donald Trump's top campaign firm has quietly handled the administration's television advertisements thanking the president for closing the border and locking up criminals, according to a Rolling Stone review.


	Strategic Media Services Inc. does not appear in any publicly available records regarding the Department of Homeland Security's controversial $200 million ad campaign. However, the ad buying firm — which was the single-biggest vendor for Trump's 2024 campaign — is the only company that's been associated with DHS' ads in filings with the Federal Communications Commission since the department announced the ads in February.  


	A DHS spokesperson denies knowing anything about Strategic Media Services, and says the firm isn't one of the department's vendors. “DHS doesn't have control of subcontractors and cannot tell a vendor who or who not to hire,” they add. Strategic Media Services did not respond to outreach from Rolling Stone.


	The Trump administration has faced scrutiny over its profligate, political-style ad campaign, in which Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem repeatedly thanks the president while attempting to scare immigrants into leaving the United States or never coming here at all. The ad campaign is one of many ways that Trump and his administration are marshaling vast public resources to make the president feel good about himself.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In one set of ads, Noem thanks Trump for “securing our border and putting America first,” while telling undocumented immigrants: “We will find you and deport you.” In another, she credits “President Trump's leadership” for her Department of Homeland Security having caught several people accused of heinous crimes.

	











	A Trump White House official says that “it is normal for an agency head to thank their principal — in this instance the president of the United States — for their policies and leadership.”


	While Trump has purged the federal workforce and slashed government programs in the name of eliminating waste and abuse, his administration determined there to be such “an unusual and compelling urgency” for this $200 million ad campaign that officials selected two Republican firms to work on the ads without a competitive bidding process.

	One of the firms, called People Who Think, has ties to former top Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski, a longtime Noem confidant who is reportedly acting as her “gatekeeper” at DHS. (They have both denied reports that they had an affair.) The second vendor, Safe America Media, is a newly created shell company operating at the home of GOP consultant Mike McElwain. 


Rolling Stone attempted to call McElwain for this story, but the man who picked up immediately hung up the phone and did not respond to texts. People Who Think did not respond to a request for comment. 


	Officials specifically exempted the DHS ads from review by Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency. The DHS briefly attempted to fund these ads with money from its Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, an oversight office the administration has tried to gut, but backtracked after Rolling Stone reported on the maneuver. 


	The involvement of Strategic Media Services, the Trump campaign's ad buyer, has not been disclosed in government procurement files or spending data.


	Trump's campaign committee disclosed paying $270 million to Strategic Media Services during the 2024 election — or more than half of what the campaign raised, according to federal election records. Most of the spending went toward ad placements.

	Dozens of FCC records show the firm buying TV time for DHS ads in recent months. The firm's buys can be traced to a 30-second version of the ad in which Noem starts: “Thank you, President Donald J. Trump, for securing our border and putting America first.” 


	Strategic Media Services also apparently placed an ad in which Noem says: “An accused rapist, murderer and child pornographer. All illegal aliens caught because of President Trump's leadership.” Noem pledges in that ad that “if you're here illegally, you will be fined nearly $1,000 a day, imprisoned, and deported,” as video plays showing her touring CECOT — the notorious mega-prison in El Salvador where Trump shipped hundreds of immigrants without due process, in open defiance of a judge's order. 

	











	After encouraging immigrants to self-deport, Noem concludes: “Under President Trump, America will be protected.”


	So far, DHS has disclosed spending roughly $77 million on the ads, federal records show. 


	Tony Carrk, executive director at the watchdog Accountable.US, tells Rolling Stone, “President Trump and his allies in Congress say they have no choice but to rip away health care and basic food aid from millions of working people and seniors. Yet there's somehow plenty of money for more Trump tax breaks for his billionaire donors and for an overtly political taxpayer-funded vanity project to repair Kristi Noem's image after her many scandals. That's the Trump administration in a nutshell: There's always enough taxpayer money to promote their brands or enrich themselves and wealthy insiders — but no money left to help everyday Americans get ahead.”

	In a budget hearing in May, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) pressed Noem on the way her department is using the public's money, including her spending “$200 million for an ad campaign fawning over President Trump's supposed accomplishments.”


	“You're just spending recklessly and it would seem wastefully, without authorization,” Blumenthal said. “That's against the law.”

	There's something special about a game of Mario Kart. Even with 30-plus years of iteration, the basic conceit hasn't changed much, and doesn't need to. Whether it's piled up on the bedroom floor in front of an old tube TV or, now, live chatting via an in-game Zoom, the joy of go-cart racing with friends remains timeless.


	But when it comes to Nintendo, there's a distinct knack for changing things just enough to twist well-worn territory into new. And while their newest console, Switch 2, isn't exactly their most ambitious, its flagship title certainly is. With Mario Kart World (out now), Nintendo aims to deliver on ideas the developers have been holding onto for a while, creating a game that's bigger and more chaotic than ever before, without skimping on the little details that give the brand its spirit.


	And while it'd be easy for more cynical folks to write it off as a tweaked take on more of the same, or a side quest rather than a much-needed killer app for a new console launch, Mario Kart World personifies everything that's great about Nintendo. It's a game of tight systems, belied depth, and endless whimsy that's going to have some staying power. It might even be the best one yet.

	











	From the start, the most obvious addition to the old Mario Kart formula comes from the game's name: its large-scale interconnected world. Historically, Mario Kart sees players select a handful of courses to run through in a cup prix, and that remains true in the new one for most modes, but now each level has been overlayed on top of a fully explorable world map. In Free Roam, which is instantly accessible from the main menu (although corralled off from the main menu as though it's a separate, more esoteric experience), players can take control of any of the game's few dozen racers and begin tearing up the terrain.

	











	It feels strange at first; going off course feels antithetical to the strict route Mario Kart normally requires. After cutting the wheel and taking to the backroads and hillsides, players will find that there's plenty to discover. Each of the game's different courses are fully available to drive through at pace to peep for collectibles (there's hundreds) and alternate paths to remember later in races. There's also P-switches to hit (again, hundreds) that kick off short, timed missions like collecting coins and dodging enemies that help hone skills and further familiarize people with the world.

	The world itself is lively, if not exactly dense. NPC passenger cars zoom around without causing a threat and there's no repercussions for running into other vehicles or even other people (Grand Theft Auto, this ain't). Seasoned players of open world games might find the free roam zone lacking, but the scattered missions string together nicely, one often flowing into the next as players are left with one or more switches just on the horizon after completing a trial. It's easy to get sucked into a string of missions organically, before getting distracted by a new costume icon, Peach medal, or secret lever to chase.


	The interconnected regions adhere to Nintendo's design philosophy that dates to Super Mario Bros. 3 and, especially, Super Mario World for the SNES, where every area has its own stock geography (snowy zones, desert areas, volcanoes, etc.), and each house about four racetracks that stick to the theme. In Grand Prix, selecting a four-race cup essentially designates a region to race through, all with an environmental throughline. Even when you're not going off alone on the open road, the world feels woven into just about every aspect of the game.

	Outside of Free Roam, Mario Kart World offers up all the well-known modes that are staples of the franchise. Grand Prix is a series of four races that can be played at one of three difficulties (with increasing speed), although the individual cups having themes means that they feel more cohesive than before. Choosing the Flower Cup, for instance, will weave together a route that begins in the desert (Desert Hills) and leads into an equally sandy Shy Guy Bazaar, then to the monster-truck-rally-esque Wario Stadium before finishing in the sky bound Airship Fortress.

	











	It's not a hard and fast rule — some tracks still pop in with a surprising change of scenery — but the curation feels good; it's less of a random assortment of races and more of an A to D journey each time.


	The journey element plays especially well in Knockout Tour, the game's take on battle royale racing. In this mode, 24 players must race through a chosen rally of four to six levels that are fully interconnected. Whereas Grand Prix stops down to show the results in between bouts, Knockout Tour is one extended cross-country death race where competitors keep driving in between tracks with just a little breather before the action picks back up.


	For players who love the stress of a nail-biting Mario Kart experience, Knockout Tour is the pinnacle of the concept. As a battle royale, each race requires players to place in a high position, with anyone below the cut off losing entirely and knocked out of the match. While Mario Kart has always shined when friends are throttling each other for first, the heightened stakes of knowing one wrong move can end the run completely makes the experience much sweatier. Winning the cup after defying death over the course of a full 20-minute sessions evokes the thrills of games like Fortnite at their peak, amplified by the lack of breaks. If you're the friend who tends to scream their way through an evening with Mario Kart, this mode will run your throat raw.


	Other than dedicated group races, there are solo Time Trials and VS Race, with the latter available in both single-player and multiplayer. In VS, custom rules can be implemented like specific item types, and a route of courses can be chosen at will. There's also Battle modes like Coin Runners and Balloon Battle, which tend to be the favorite for people who can never seem to get a leg up on actual races. With 24-players (up from 12), the battle courses are expanded in size but always end up being frenetic.


	While there's plenty to do, perhaps the best aspect of Mario Kart World is all the little details to see. With 50 characters (up from the last game's 42), including the obvious choices like Mario, Luigi, and Peach, the game's roster now includes tons of ridiculous inclusions from the lore of Mario games — including some deep cuts. Players can now choose former NPCs like Mario 64's penguin and Sidestepper (who's just a tiny crab), all of whom are brimming with personality.

	











	In 2025, lively character animations shouldn't be that impressive, but from the driver select screen to mid-race gameplay, each of the racers exude an infectious charisma. Flipping through before a race, it's easy to get caught up watching the towering Wiggler do a Carlton-like dance or Monty Mole rhythmically slapping his belly as it jiggles. Little details like this make Mario Kart World feel modern in a subtle way even when the graphics aren't exactly cutting edge. Nintendo is wise enough to know that showcasing the power on its new console doesn't just boil down to lifelike facsimiles or breaching the uncanny valley; it's best suited to making everything even more fantastical.


	The level of detail plays heavily into how Mario Kart World actually works, too. With increased horsepower comes more complex physics and capabilities in-game. While older games in the series relied heavily on memorizing courses and perpetually driving with precision around every bend, there's now a lot more ways to play catch up and get ahead.


	Like in Mario Kart 8, executing a taunt (with the drift button) at the apex of a ramp will let players get a little speed boost. But now, with the inclusion of the Charge Jump (using the same button on straightaways), it's possible to jump onto rails and powerlines to grind or along walls for a sideways ride. Grinding on railroad tracks offers a speed boost and can be reupped by performing the taunt. But little opportunities arise everywhere; heavy waves in water can propel racers just enough to warrant a boost push and can strung together by smart player to blast through areas that otherwise might've slowed them down.

	Tracks have been sized up to accommodate more racers, but it also leads to open areas where there's so much going on, you might not even know what's happening in the periphery. Small pockets of micro-incursions can break out in open fields of dust storms where a few players are battling it out while you're on your merry way grinding on the far edge of the lane. It all adds to the feeling that every race has more emergent elements, even when so many of the obstacles are scripted. How 24 people react in real time is what keeps every competition interesting.


	It would've been easy for Nintendo to make a Mario Kart 9 that stuck to its more linear roots, but by leaning into what works best and turning up of the knob on the things people love most — the accessibility, charm, and chaos — Mario Kart World ends up being a peak for a classic franchise. This is a game that will be dominating time on rec room TV or backseat car rides for years to come.

"I said I love them dangerous," the vocalist croons on the track.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Mariah Carey isn't playing it safe on new single “Type Dangerous,” which ushered in a new musical era for the vocalist Thursday (June 5).


	Featuring the superstar singing over a swaggering, percussion-heavy beat, the track showcases Mimi channeling her sultriest, most confident self. “Looking for the dangerous type,” she croons. “I like them dangerous/ That's my type/ I said I love them dangerous.”


	The track arrives after several days of teasing on Carey's social media accounts, with the icon first getting her Lambs hyped by sharing a video of herself in a luxury car, listening to a mysterious track titled “T:D_MC16.mp3.” In that same clip, the camera panned down to show that the vehicle's license plate displayed the characters, “MC16” — leading fans to conclude that the Songbird Supreme also has a new album on the way. 

	











	“Type Dangerous” serves as Carey's first proper single in years, with the five-time Grammy winner last dropping an album, Caution, in 2018. The project — which marked the 15th album in her discography — reached No. 5 on the Billboard 200. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Carey has since busied herself with her annual “All I Want for Christmas Is You” promotional cycles, as well as celebrating the anniversaries of her most iconic albums. Most recently, she commemorated The Emancipation of Mimi turning 20 years old by dropping an expansive two-disc set compiling numerous remixes, bonus tracks, radio mixes and a cappella cuts. (Billboard also celebrated the milestone by ranking all 18 of the album's original tracks.)


	Listen to Carey's new song “Type Dangerous” below.

An awesomely violent and artfully staged piece of animated pulp, “Predator: Killer of Killers” feels like a movie that was dreamed up by a couple of stoned teenage boys in a suburban basement one night during the summer of 1987, but this is the rare case where that feels like a good thing. A very good thing, even. 

Close your eyes and you can practically hear Dan Trachtenberg — whose impressive “Prey” made him the de facto thought leader of the “Predator” franchise — passing a miserable blunt to screenwriter and co-director Micho Robert Rutare as one of them asks “Who would win in a fight: a Predator or a ninja? What about a Predator or a Viking?” These are some of the great questions of our time, and “Killer of Killers” answers them with enough style and savagery to share a sweet little contact high with everyone who streams it.

The project's charm lies in the fact that it doesn't try to do anything else. An anthology-like collection of death matches in which cinema's most toxically militaristic alien species hunts the greatest human warriors across our planet's history, “Killer of Killers” is so mission-driven and self-possessed that it never feels the least bit like an elaborate teaser for Trachtenberg's forthcoming “Badlands” (a theatrical release that will determine the continued viability of the “Predator” franchise), even if it does a phenomenal job of convincing people to give a shit about the “Yautja” again — or for the first time. 

 










All red meat and no gristle, “Killer of Killers” leapfrogs through the centuries — with occasional flash-forwards into sci-fi territory — as if it were using the “Assassin's Creed” games like a treasure map. The action starts on the shores of Valhalla circa 841 A.D., where a vengeance-obsessed valkyrie named Ursa (voiced by Lindsay LaVanchy) leads her son Anders on a raid to kill the barbarian king who ransacked her village when she was a child. “Why do we fight?,” she asks the boy. “Because our enemy still lives,” he replies. 

Locked into the siege like Timothée Chalamet at a Knicks playoff game in Indiana, the invisibility-cloaked Predator who's watching from the sidelines may have traveled hundreds of light years for a front-row seat to the carnage, but that sort of zero-sum ethos surely reminds him of home. The alien's plan is the same across the first three of the movie's four segments: Let the humans slaughter each other, and then ambush the last — and presumably strongest — warrior standing as a test of its own skill as a hunter. One second Ursa is standing triumphant over the corpse of her enemy, and the next her minions are screaming “Grendel!” as the Predator starts ripping their spinal cords out of their backs and/or pulverizing their bodies into red mush. 

 










While those combat tests have a tendency to be wildly unfair (I'm not sure what a Predator would prove to itself by using a space-age shockwave gun to obliterate a guy holding a wooden spear, but maybe a red-blooded American man who shoots forest animals for sport could explain it to me), the Yautja also have a tendency of failing them in spectacular fashion, as it quickly becomes clear that people are still the most dangerous game. Contextualized as a duel between two different breeds of “monster” (one being Ursa's bloodlust, and the other a demon from outer space), the battle that comprises much of the opening chapter is nothing less than nerd-ass shit par excellence. 

As in subsequent episodes, the movie's “violence is unevolved” moral framing doesn't stop Rutare and Trachtenberg from choreographing the Viking vs. E.T. fight with fetishistic grace, particularly because the CG animation — stilted in its faux-rotoscoped movement, but soaked with the detail and lush ferity of a classic graphic novel — allows them to stage action that would be impossible to sell (or afford) in live-action. Moving away from green screen, the Volume, and other sources of sludgy-looking FX also gives the filmmakers license to make fantastic use of their characters' environments. 

 










A good time for its gore alone, the Ursa brawl is made all the more satisfying because of how cleverly she weaponizes Viking ships against against the Predator, in much the same way as the Japan-set episode that comes next takes full advantage of Tokugawa period architecture as a shinobi hops around a 17th century fortress with a Yautja on his tail (no spoilers, but let's just say the Predators are ill-prepared to fight on the Kawara tiles that lined every 17th castle from Edo on out). 

If “The Sword” maxes out all of the cultural tenets you'd expect an American cartoon like this to exploit, Rutare and Trachtenberg solve the triteness of its story — two brothers, raised by their father as bitter rivals, fight to the death in order to prove their supremacy — by embracing its basicness. Almost entirely wordless from start to finish, the segment pares the sibling rivalry down to its purest level so that it can distill what its characters might be capable of achieving together if they ever fought as one… a theme that “Killer of Killers” will return to with a vengeance in its out-of-this-world fourth segment.

But in order to reach those heights, the movie first has to take to the skies, which it does in a 1942-set chapter about a wide-eyed Navy mechanic (voiced by Rick Gonzalez) who steals a rickety old plane and flies into battle against the Nazi fleet after he becomes convinced that something else has been hiding in the clouds and shooting down all his friends. This episode is slow to take off, as it starts by doubling down on the film's recurring fixation with children proving themselves to their parents (a relevant motif in a franchise preoccupied with self-worth, but one that “Killer of Killers” can only glance at between grudge matches), and its chatty protagonist grows tiresome in a hurry. 

 










But once he's airborne, Rutare and Trachtenberg delight in orchestrating some ultra-graphic aerial mayhem, as our hero tries to outfox a heat-seeking alien jet from the cockpit of a busted tin can. Tom Cruise might have a slight edge when it comes to realism, but Rutare and Trachtenberg giddily compensate for that with stratospheric nose-dives and hailstorms full of disembodied limbs. The gore never quite reaches “Ninja Scroll” levels or anything like that, but “Killer of Killers” is able to maintain a rock-hard R without ever lowering itself to the level of empty titillation. 

By that point in the movie, there's little mystery left as to what Rutare and Trachtenberg are building toward for a grand finale: A melee that will somehow blend Ursa's ambivalent revenge with the ninja's regretful lonerism and the flyboy's inextinguishable resourcefulness. This final segment is a bit sillier and more cartoonish than the ones before it, as “Killer of Killers” is suddenly forced to juggle a variety of (very) different personalities on a hostile alien world whose rules and physics are as rooted in fiction as the film's previous settings were rooted in fact, but there's a satisfying concision to how the script pulls all of its various stories together, and — for a project that could have felt like nothing but fan service — I appreciated that Rutare and Trachtenberg save their movie's only explicit allusion to the rest of the “Predator” franchise until the end credits. 

 










Running a very tight 80 minutes or so between titles, “Killer of Killers” doesn't pretend to be a blockbuster-sized entry in a series that has always struggled to find the right scale for itself, but it even more adamantly refuses to be the sort of throwaway junk that we've been conditioned to expect from straight-to-streaming spinoffs, remakes, sequels, and the like. Fantastic as this film would be to see on the big screen, I'd go so far as to say that this is what streaming should be for: Immaculately crafted bonus treats that stand on their own two feet and demand to be watched with both eyes at the same time as they serve to reinforce the primacy of the theatrical releases that prop them up. In a bottomless content abyss where only the strongest material survives, “Killer of Killers” should have no trouble slaying the rest of its competition on your Hulu home page. 

“Predator: Killer of Killers” will be available to stream on Hulu starting Friday, June 6.

Ahead of Father's Day, the 'Jungle Cruise' superstar is bringing Papatui to Walmart stores — these are his top gift picks "for fathers, grandfathers and father figures who could use a little self care."

	Ahead of Father's Day, Dwayne Johnson reveals how he continues to honor his influential late grandfather through his men's grooming brand, Papatui, and his film roles.


	In a new Instagram post, the Jungle Cruise star and girl dad shared how his Samoan grandfather, High Chief Peter Maivia, “epitomized true masculinity and ‘self care' before self care became a popular term,” he wrote. “[He] was a big influence on me, respected everywhere he went and knew how to take care of himself, and he was also the inspiration behind my character Maui from Moana,” Johnson explains in the video, which also coincides with Papatui's debut in Walmart stores and online. The brand is also available at Target.

	The superstar entrepreneur has previously spoken about how his affordable body care company's name comes from “little tui,” the nickname given to him by his grandfather; and “papa,” which also means “rock” in Samoan and references his favorite role as a father.

A post shared by Dwayne Johnson (@therock)


	The 53-year-old father of three continued, “We all have fathers, grandfathers, father figures in our lives who could use a little self care, which is why this Father's Day, I recommend you get them Papatui men's care essentials from Walmart. Unleash your inner Papatui — I have no idea what that means but it sounds cool!”


	Launched last year, Papatui spans skin care; body washes, soaps and lotions; aluminum-free deodorants and antiperspirants; hair care; tattoo care and more grooming products, all under $13. The formulas are all vegan, cruelty-free and formulated without phthalates, parabens and sulfates, while the brand's hero fragrances were developed by Frank Voelkl, who created Le Labo's best-selling Santal 33. Voelkl is behind signature scents such as Sandalwood Suede, Papatui's warm and woody “proprietary five-star resort and spa” fragrance; Lush Coconut with notes of vanilla that smells like “a luxury island escape”; and Cedar Sport, a fresh cedarwood aroma that “gives a hit of ‘conquer the day' energy in the mornings.” (The brand also offers Vanilla Shea and unscented options.)

When Adam David won season 27 of “The Voice” in May 2025, he knew it would not be the last time he saw his coach, Michael Bublé. 

Although many contestants never see the celebrity coaches they worked with on the show once their season is over, Bublé promised his back-to-back winners — David and season 26's Sofronio Vasquez — he would continue to be their coach and friend long after the show was over. Both singers have said the superstar is keeping his word.

A post shared by Sofronio Vasquez III (@sofroniovasquez)

Since his win in 2024, Vasquez — the first Filipino singer to win the U.S. version of “The Voice” — has documented some of the ways Bublé has continued to be involved in his life and career, from working on new music to helping him get gigs. 

On June 5, he posted a screenshot from a FaceTime chat he'd just had with Bublé and wrote, “Not only is he my coach from The Voice, which historically made us win, but he also became family. He calls and sends some wisdom and great news for people like me who dream bigger than the world. Thank you, @michaelbuble”

The two reunited on May 7, when Vasquez shared two Instagram posts showing them together in Los Angeles and captioned their joyful selfies by writing, “had a very productive lunch with the man himself @michaelbuble. we skipped dessert because we are on diet LOL 😂”

Vasquez told WKTV in Utica that Bublé has been instrumental in his success since the show, sharing that the Grammy winner “managed to pull in people that he worked with before—like writers, musical producers. And some of the songs that he has written have not been recorded, or he's written new songs just for me.”

Bublé has also made it possible for Vasquez to perform for and with major celebrities, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates in March, when he attended prolific producer David Foster's birthday party for his wife, Katharine McPhee.

Meanwhile, Bublé has also said he plans to be part of David's life and career, too. Right after David won season 27, the Grammy winner told People that he was so excited, he probably wouldn't be able to sleep that night. 

He told the outlet, “You know what? This is personal for me because honestly, when the cameras shut off, we're friends. He's such a good dude. I won't sleep.”

“He had all the talent, all of it, all the ambitions, all of the unique ability,” Bublé continued. “And all I ever did was just, I wasn't coach. I was a buddy, man. Not all of our conversations are music, which is amazing.” 

On May 22, David told Good Housekeeping that he'd already had talks with both his coach and Vasquez about possible collaborations. 

“Obviously, I want to continue growing my relationship with Michael,” he told the outlet. “I don't think I can reveal anything truly, but we've had some conversations about things. And actually, I spoke with Sofronio Vasquez, and we've had some conversations, too.”

The season 19 trailer for “The Real Housewives of Orange County” dropped on June 5, and fans can't wait for the premiere to start.

In the preview shared by Bravo, the cast, which consists of Katie Ginella, Shannon Beador, Emily Simpson, Heather Dubrow, Tamra Judge, Gina Kirschenheiter, and Jennifer Pedranti, are seen taking a polygraph test.

Past “RHOC” star Gretchen Rossi is returning as a friend-of.

A post shared by Bravo (@bravotv)

“There's a snake in the group,” Beador is heard saying. “No one likes a liar,” Judge says. Dubrow adds, “She's not telling the truth.”

It's unclear who they're talking about, the trailer also shows some lighthearted moments from the cast's New Orleans and Amsterdam trip.

Fans are also looking forward to Rossi's return after her departure following season 8. She dredges up her years-long feud with Judge, who tells her, “12 years you've been going after me!”

“Tamra and Gretchen's feud back on screen is a dream come true, now that is an insane old school rivalry. Inject this into my veins!” a fan wrote on X.

Drama between Judge and Pedranti is also revisited from season 18, and it looks like the former Cut Fitness owner also gets into it with Beador.

“Shannon saying, ‘Are you kidding me?' is like the familiar sound of home. Can't wait,” an eager viewer posted.

A few “RHOC” season 19 cast members are already fan-faves and one wrote, “Clocking in to defend Jenn & Gretchen all season!! My absolute [favorites] from new school & old school Orange County!!!”

After Rossi's long hiatus from “RHOC,” Beador is happy to have her on board. “I am excited about it, and she's very kind,” she told Us Weekly in March.

“She's been nothing but sweet to me, so I think she's going to be a good addition,” Beador added.

Beador continued, “We're just finished week three — and the drama's already starting.”

Rossi shared with Us Weekly in April 2021 that she hadn't spoken to Judge in years, so their drama has been brewing before their reunion in the upcoming season.

“Thankfully, we don't really live in the same community, so I don't have to run into her or anything like that,” she said.

The mom of one stated, “I really don't hold grudges, whatever, [let] bygones be bygones, I'm in such a better place in my life than I was dealing with all that on ‘Housewives.'”

Fans of “Summer House” have plenty to talk about when it comes to Paige DeSorbo's personal life and her career. Rumors continue to swirl about her connection to Joe D'Amelio, especially now that DeSorbo has officially announced her exit from “Summer House” after seven seasons. Here's everything we know.

A post shared by B the Prosecco Princess  🥂 (@bravoandcocktails)

Following her late 2024 breakup with “Southern Charm” star Craig Conover, Paige DeSorbo insists she is currently single. However, her fans and Bravo gossip accounts aren't so sure. Clues continue to surface suggesting that DeSorbo is dating businessman Joe D'Amelio.

Sightings of the pair date back to January, when a fan submitted a photo to “Bravo and Cocktails” showing them together at a Philadelphia Eagles game. In February, they were allegedly spotted holding hands at the Super Bowl in New Orleans.

Celebrity gossip outlet Deux Moi posted an image that reportedly shows the two walking hand-in-hand during Super Bowl weekend. “Steph With Da Deets” also highlighted that the mystery man with DeSorbo wore the same watch and shoes as D'Amelio and that his tattoos match those seen in other photos.

Meanwhile, “Xoxo Bravo Girl” shared a post of flowers that appeared in DeSorbo's Instagram story—with what looked like part of D'Amelio's tattooed arm also visible. The fan account commented, “If these flowers were from her parents or a friend she would've said so, I'm sure.”

DeSorbo recently told People, “I'm definitely not jumping into anything serious right now. I want to focus on my career, and I want to do things when I want to do them, with who I want to do them with, so I'm just enjoying my time.” Still, the Super Bowl photos suggest something might be blooming. Deux Moi reported that DeSorbo was “spotted getting cozy with her rumored friend,” while Enty Lawyer teased that a certain reality star (believed to be DeSorbo) was trying to quietly manage a new relationship.

Fans have also noticed her purse in a selfie posted by D'Amelio, as well as what appear to be matching hotel room photos shared by both.

A post shared by Bravo (@bravotv)

While speculation about her love life continues, DeSorbo just confirmed a major career move—she is leaving “Summer House.” The announcement came the morning after part two of the season 9 reunion aired.

“I have a little life update for you: I've made the decision not to return to ‘Summer House,'” DeSorbo shared via Instagram Stories on June 5. “Being part of this show has been one of the most rewarding chapters of my life—the friendships, the drama, the giggles. All unforgettable.”

DeSorbo joined the Bravo series in season 3, which debuted in 2019. “You've seen me grow up over these last seven summers,” she reflected. “I'll always be grateful for the memories, the community, and the opportunities this wild ride has brought me.”

The 32-year-old added, “But like all good things (and some bad decisions), it's time for this chapter to close.” She also promised fans: “You haven't seen the last of me, I promise. So much more to do together, but for now you know you can always find me and Daphne in my bed.”

As for rumors that DeSorbo might join “The Real Housewives of New York City,” she recently told Glamour, “Housewives is such an established franchise, I think it would be very hard for me to assimilate. I would never say never, but it's not something I'm working toward.”

Sources told “Bravo and Cocktails” that her decision to leave “Summer House” may be related to her desire to keep her single life more private. “My thought is she doesn't want her single love life played out on camera,” one source shared.

“Dancing With the Stars” alum Brooke Burke is in a long-term relationship with Scott Rigsby, and the couple has been engaged since September 2021. They should have celebrated their wedding day last week, but had to make the tough decision to postpone, and now Burke is opening up about why they did that.

A post shared by Brooke Burke (@brookeburke)

In an interview with Page Six on May 28, which was published on June 4, Burke was asked about her wedding day, and she revealed that it was meant to be that day. She confirmed that “actually no one knew,” that they had confirmed the date, but they were filled with sadness about not having the ceremony. “Today when I woke up, we were both, like, [crying],” she told Page Six. “We have been so busy. We built a home in Arizona. We blended our family. We moved in together [in Malibu]. We had the fires and then the fires again and the floods.”

Burke also discussed how the last few years had been “weird” for her and Rigsby, and that after being engaged for almost four years, she felt it was “almost embarrassing” when people ask about when she will get married. She doesn't want to stay engaged forever. It is not just her fans who are curious about their wedding, but even their children. Burke confirmed that she and Rigsby would like to have their wedding before the end of 2025.

The topic of wedding planning has been something Burke has been asked about several times in the last few weeks. In an interview with People on June 3, she commented again on her upcoming nuptials. She also revealed why May 28 was so special to her (so could 2026 be the year she says “I do?”).

“I had a really weird wish — because I'm a little bit weird — to get married on 5/28, which is the frequency of love,” she told People. The publication reports that the “love frequency” is often thought to be 528 Hz. 

Burke again commented on how they had been busy and the date had to be pushed back again. But she teased, “We gotta do it next year.” The actress referred to herself as being “slow” to get married, but when she does, it's going to be a memorable occasion. “It's got to be big,” she told People. “That's why it hasn't happened yet.”

She continued, “We want to do something different and innovative and show people how to make a difference. But it's not just about writing checks, it's about having fun, telling your story, living out loud, participating. Generational philanthropy. Nobody's talking about that.”

The woman going by Jane Doe from the witness stand at the rap mogul's trial detailed a romantic courtship that devolved quickly into drug-fueled sex marathons with other men. 


							By 

	Kevin Dolak



	A woman federal prosecutors are calling a victim of Sean “Diddy” Combs took the stand at his federal trial in lower Manhattan on Thursday, telling the court that during their three year relationship, which lasted up until his September arrest, 90 percent of their time together was during drug-fueled, days-long “freak-offs” where she was coerced into performing sex acts with male sex workers.


	The woman, who is being referred to as Jane Doe during the trial to protect her identity, is the latest woman brought forth by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York to explain how the feds say the once powerful rap and fashion mogul used his companies and loyal staff as a criminal enterprise to coerce and control women, whom he would blackmail and manipulate into performing in “freak-off” sex marathons, which the near-billionaire would often film while masturbating. Combs has pled not guilty to all charges in the feds' five-count indictment, which includes sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution.

	Taking the stand after court had returned from the day's lunch break, Jane Doe revealed early in her testimony that prior to connecting romantically with Combs in 2021, she was involved with a man with whom Combs has history and a tense relationship. She said she met the rap world icon in Miami at a party she attended with a group of girlfriends, one of whom was casually dating Combs at the time, since his 2018 split with R&B singer Cassie Ventura, the federal prosecutors' star witness. Combs has been involved with several women at once, a fact that Doe told the jury was known to her as the relationship's inception.

	Over her first few hours of testimony Thursday afternoon, Doe painted a picture of the couple's meet-cute and easy segue into a more serious relationship, which grew over phone calls, texts and FaceTime video calls. In fact, their relationship saw a boom when Doe's friend, who was dating Combs, got engaged and moved to Europe. Soon, she told the court, Combs swept her off her feet with a trip to Turks and Caicos and the Bahamas over 15 days. The two enjoyed the relaxing island and dinner on their hotel suite's balcony, where they enjoyed viewing sunsets together. She recalled how he even bought her a bracelet that spells out L-O-V-E. Their sex life was the two of them; she was smitten. 


	“I really fell head over heels for Sean,” she said, adding that it was OK for her that he was also seeing other people because she really liked him. “I understood that on his end, it was never a monogamous relationship. 


	One small hiccup on the trip, she recalled, came when Doe was handed an ecstasy pill by Combs and ended up so gobsmacked by the mind-bending drug that she doubled over in the sand and had to be taken into a tepid shower; over the remainder of the 15-day trip, Doe said she took Ecstacy 10 more times in smaller increments that were pieced out by Combs. 


	The questioning prosecuting attorney on Thursday quickly moved on to the moment that the relationship soured for Doe, when she asked her to recall for the court the night of March 21, 2021, when she was asked to participate in her first “freak-off” with Combs, which were also referred to as “hotel nights” at times. After Combs' assistants had set up the hotel suite, Doe said, she would dress in racy lingerie and high-heeled shoes. That was when Combs told her someone was coming: a male escort named Don, whom Combs said he knew. The encounter as described by Doe followed a familiar trajectory, one described by Ventura a few weeks ago when she testified about her “freak-off” experiences: the woman and escort would pour baby oil onto each other's bodies (12 bottles one time, she said); the two begin touching; Doe begins to perform oral sex on Don as Combs watches, masturbating. From the witness stand, Doe said that it was she who “tried to move things along” into the suite's bedroom. Combs protested when Doe asked to use a condom, she explained to the court, but he soon provided one and Don and Doe began to have sex. 

	











	Doe said that her initial experience performing a “freak-off” hotel night with Combs made her “happy” and that “it was taboo.”


	“I just thought that it was a night of fun; I didn't think that we'd be doing it again,” she told the court, at that point holding back tears. “I think that night opened a Pandora's Box in our relationship and I was never able to shut it. It just completely set the tone for our relationship moving forward.”


	When asked to give a percentage figure by federal prosecutors, Doe told the court that after May 2021, 90 percent of the sexual experiences she had with Combs involved other men. The rapper, Doe told the court, suggested they have a hotel night the very next time the two saw each other. 


	“I just wanted to satisfy my partner,” she said of participating in the freak-offs. 


	As their relationship stretched into months, Combs began to give large sums of money to Doe, whose work marketing brands on her social media accounts was dwindling. He handed her $10,000 after their initial trip to Turks and Caicos as she'd missed out on some work while on the trip with him; later, he'd typically give her $5,000 or $6,000 incrementally. As was the case with Ventura, he began to pay for her apartment; Doe said this was a reason she felt compelled to participate in “freak-offs” even when she started to not enjoy them.


	“I felt obligated to perform because my partner was paying my rent,” she explained. 

	











	An attempt she had planned to earn her own money by launching an Only Fans account, where she would appear in lingerie and bikinis, could have helped out with a sense of independence — as she told Combs, a friend had claimed she'd brought in $4 million in a year doing a Just Fans page. But Combs, she testified, was having none of that, telling her, “Let's just give it time.” Prosecutors believe this constitutes coercion to keep Doe financially dependent on him so he could control her and force her into his sexual fantasies. 


	At a point, Doe says, she asked Combs if they could stop doing “freak-offs” altogether. His response, she told the court, was to threaten her livelihood and home. 


	“He would just say things like, ‘If you want to break up, that's fine. You have three months left on the house because I'm not about to be paying rent,'” Jane recalled Combs saying.


	Doe's testimony will continue Friday as the prosecution begins to eye the resting of its case.

Yolanda Hadid and ​​Joseph Jingoli started dating in January 2019 and got engaged three years later. Fans may have assumed they were in the middle of wedding planning, but People reports that they broke up in January 2025. The news had not been reported until now. But what went wrong, and why did the pair end their engagement?

A post shared by YOLANDA (@yolanda.hadid)

“They remain friends and have nothing but fond memories of their time together,” the source said on June 5, People reports.

The former couple first met in 2017 after the “Real Housewives” alum moved to Pennsylvania. In 2022, during a trip to Holland, they became engaged. Still, apart from a few glimpses into their relationship on Instagram and a rare interview, Hadid and Jingoli chose to keep their coupling out of the spotlight. This was a different tactic for Hadid, who has previously been married to Mohamed Hadid and David Foster, the latter of whom featured in the reality show “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.”

No further details on why Hadid and Jingoli broke up have been revealed, but we do know that there was a time when they were incredibly in love.

After Hadid's divorce from Foster in 2015, she took time for herself and had no intentions of dating again. That changed when Jingoli entered her life by chance. “I really started focusing,” she told People in January 2018. “I made a love spiral and wrote down exactly everything that was important to me in a man and he magically just rang the doorbell at the farm.”

She also shared how their health struggles bonded them. “When you meet somebody that thought he was going to die, like I felt I was gonna die, you have a whole new appreciation for life and you kind of share that, so that's really already a common bond that we have,” she said. “To live in the moment, enjoy every day, and not wait. Why take it slow? Let's just go for it and have a great time.”

Hadid has been open about her Lyme disease diagnosis in 2012, and the couple even made their public debut when they attended the Global Lyme Alliance's Annual Gala in N.Y.C. in October 2019. 

Hadid has also celebrated their relationship with Instagram posts, including one on January 9, 2019, marking their second anniversary. “All my life I prayed for someone like you!! “ Hadid captioned a photo of them. “Thank you for being such a bright light in my life, the calm in my storm, and for being the most honorable man that I know.”

As “American Idol” winner Jamal Roberts' star continues to rise, from jam-packed shows to a chart-topping single, the soul singer from Meridian, Mississippi, took time on June 4, 2025, to clarify comments he made about his upbringing days earlier on “The Love You Moore Show.”

Roberts, 27, vulnerably shared with host Willie Moore Jr. that when he was two, his parents separated and his dad gained full custody of him and his older brother. Roberts bravely admitted that he felt “abandoned” by his mom, Kim, and that he struggled to understand why she didn't fight to be with him, especially when she later had more children. But he told Moore Jr. that he was “fine” with not knowing why his mom was so absent years ago and confirmed she is back in his life today. 

After the interview, Roberts was dismayed to see many social media comments and posts that he felt “twisted” his remarks. So, he hosted a nearly hour-long Facebook Live session on June 4, hoping to dissuade people from bad-mouthing his mom and questioning his relationship with her. He also shared how much good came out of him sharing his truth.

“Everybody got something to say,” he said with a smile. “I can't entertain everybody. You wake up in the morning and you making long posts about something that don't even concern you? That ought to just speak for itself. It ain't got nothing to do with you.”

Roberts tagged his mom during his Facebook Live, which he hosted from his Nashville hotel room as he prepared for the 19 Recordings/BMG Takeover with fellow “American Idol” finalists. Over 3,500 people watched his monologue live, and thousands more have viewed it since. 

The reason he shared the story of his upbringing, Roberts said, was to be transparent and to show how his faith has helped him through challenging times. 

“I'm talking about when you have your own story, like when you know the pros, you know the cons, you know in your mind how you felt in that moment,” he said. “My story is not bashing anybody. My story is simply saying that you can come out of anything. God will walk with you. He'll walk beside you. He'll take you through.” 

Roberts also told his Facebook Live viewers that sharing his story was eye-opening for him and others, explaining, “You know what I found out over all the hundreds of thousands of messages I received? I'm not the only one that's been through that or that has a similar story to me.” 

“I'm so happy I spoke,” he continued, “and I'm so happy to see all the other people that was afraid, all the other people that was in that situation … like, they starting to heal. They were like, ‘Okay, so it is okay.' It's okay! We all go through different battles. It's okay! You're not in it alone. My story is still being written.” 

Roberts' mom, who was frequently seen cheering for Roberts in the “American Idol” studio audience, shared her own Facebook post on the morning of June 4, writing, “GOOD MORNING … I'm not embarrassed about anything I went through what may be tea for some, it is a testimony for me if you're gonna talk about what broke me invite me to the table so I can tell you what God did with the pieces. #Godisgood”

During his Facebook Live, Roberts praised his dad, stepmom, and grandparents for filling the “void” of having an absent parent. He also assured his fans that there are no hard feelings with his mom because his childhood shaped him in many positive ways. 

“My mom is not a bad person,” he said. “We all go through different things, but God's always putting somebody in your life that can just fill that void like he filled that void for me.”

“This is why people don't tell their stories,” he continued. “This is why people don't tell their stories right now, because you got people that will twist it and fold it and make it to whatever they want it to be … taking it out of its original context.” 

Noting that “I'm healing from all that,” Roberts said that his experience with letting go of the past and forging a positive relationship with his mom is part of why Tom Odell's song “Heal” resonated so deeply with him during “American Idol.” Roberts said he hopes his version, a single that immediately shot up the Billboard charts, inspires others to do whatever they need to do to heal emotionally, too.

“I'm healing, I have my parents in my life,” he said, later adding, “I love my mom, I love my dad, I love my family, you know, but at a time in my life, I did feel alone.” 

Before signing off, Roberts sweetly told those watching, “I love y'all. I love y'all, for real. If you don't hear it from nobody else, I love you.”

‘The more I can run around on spaceships, the better.'

by  Samantha Nelson

USA/Syfy's Resident Alien started as a quirky mashup of Northern Exposure and Invader Zim, a fish-out-of-water comedy where Harry Vanderspeigle (Alan Tudyk of Firefly, Rogue One, and Andor), the new doctor in the small town of Patience, Colorado, is actually an alien who wants to take over Earth. Harry's secret was originally only known to Max Hawthorne (Judah Prehn) — a kid with the rare genetic ability to see through alien disguises, who devotes himself to trying to stop Harry's plans — and health-clinic worker Asta Twelvetrees (Sara Tomko), who teaches Harry the value of humanity.

Though the series' protagonist is an alien, the show's science fiction elements were relatively subtle in the early seasons. Harry spends as much time investigating the murder of the town's last doctor as he does trying to fix his ship and get his mission back on track. The locals write off his weirdness because they're dealing with their own challenges: Asta confronting her abusive ex, her best friend D'arcy Bloom (Alice Wetterlund) dealing with opioid addiction, Max's parents Ben (Levi Fiehler) and Kate (Meredith Garretson) winding up on opposites sides of a debate about bringing a fancy ski resort to Patience.

“I think it was a nice way to be introduced to the sci-fi world for people who don't normally like [the genre],” Tomko told Polygon in a video interview.

But as the series went on, more characters wound up uncovering the show's secrets. Deputy Sheriff Liv Baker (Elizabeth Bowen) began looking for unconventional explanations for the odd crimes Patience experienced. Ben and Kate were abducted by aliens who stole their baby. Asta shared Harry's true identity with D'arcy so she could stop lying about it. Even skeptical Sheriff Mike Thompson (Corey Reynolds) had a close encounter with an extraterrestrial. The science fiction elements are fully on display in season 4, which premieres on June 6.

“What I love about our show is there's Harry's world, which is the world of aliens, and there's people in town who haven't know about that, and you care about them because the writing is so strong that everyone is really well developed,” Garretson told Polygon in a video interview. “What's cool about season 4 is that more and more of Harry's world is bleeding into the town, so I think it's an opportunity for the characters to become even more three-dimensional. When are people going to find out what's going on, and then how do they handle that?”

D'arcy was quick to embrace the chance to help Harry, who is now focused on saving humanity from other aliens. She's gone on several dangerous missions, including sneaking into the home of a human-alien hybrid and infiltrating a gray alien base on the moon, where she rescued the Hawthornes' daughter. This season, she even travels back in time with Harry to recover alien technology. Wetterlund, who's also the co-host of the “Treks and the City” Star Trek: The Next Generation podcast, is very enthusiastic about the way Resident Alien has evolved.

“I think that science fiction is a perfect slate on which to examine the human experience, because it removes the historical context that humanity is in and puts it in this imagined world,” she told Polygon in a video interview. “How would these humans in a small town deal with the exploding of their worldview? That is exciting for me. I've always wanted to be part of a sci-fi project like this. The more I can run around on spaceships, the better.”

Reynolds said he grew up watching the Aliens franchise and RoboCop, and he's excited about the chance to get more involved in Resident Alien's science fiction elements.

“I'm proudly a nerd, so this fits my wheelhouse perfectly,” he told Polygon.

Acknowledging the existence of aliens has fundamentally shifted the dynamics in Patience's sheriff's office, where Mike has often been dismissive of Liv's ideas. Now they're working together to uncover a dangerous conspiracy and help an alien tracking cyborg played by Lost's Peter Bach.

“I think we've really stepped into the realm of them being partners, and out of the shadow of the subordinate aspect of things,” Reynolds said. “Mike understands Liv was right. You don't earn any more credibility in Mike's world faster than being right. She was right the whole time. That dynamic fused with what they've been through personally has created a bond that is everything.”

Scenes involving alien spaceships and time portals cost a lot more than ones set in Patience's bar or city hall, and showrunner Chris Sheridan has had to get creative as the show's science fiction elements have expanded — especially since the series had its budget significantly cut going into season 4. One of the main ways the show is saving time and money is by having the gray aliens remove Harry's ability to transform into his alien form.

“That saves us Alan getting in and out of makeup,” Sheridan told Polygon. “Whenever he walks by a mirror, we see a reflection, and that takes time and money animating him.”

Among all the ideas Sheridan had for hiding the budget cuts, that one stuck with him because it fit so well with the show's themes and plot, where Harry has slowly gained more emotional awareness and attachments as he's come to appreciate humans.

“What if he's in this place where he's just human for a while?” Sheridan asked. “What does that do to the character? There's a challenge every year to try to mix things up and add something new, so we were looking to bring out something new in Harry.”

Resident Alien season 4 premieres on Syfy and USA at 11 p.m. ET on Friday, June 6. Episodes will be available to stream on Peacock one week later.

The trove of papers from pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing was discovered in a loft.

A trove of Alan Turing's papers, including his own personal copy of his PhD dissertation, is going up for auction June 17 after narrowly avoiding destruction.

The papers were "offprints," or copies of papers distributed in small batches within academia. They include not only Turing's signed dissertation, but also 1937's "On Computable Numbers," considered the first computer programming manual, and 1952's "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis," Turing's last major published work.

Turing was an English mathematician, codebreaker and one of the first computer scientists. The newly discovered papers were given by his mother, Ethel Turing, to her son's friend, fellow mathematician Norman Routledge, according to Rare Book Auctions, the company handling the sale.

After Norman's death in 2013, one of his daughters stuck the papers in her own loft. When she moved into a care home almost a decade later, one of her daughters found the papers and considered shredding them. But she asked around the family and decided to get them appraised instead, taking them along to specialists Rare Books Auctions in a carrier bag.

"Nothing could've prepared me for what I was about to find in that carrier bag," Rare Books Auction director Jim Spencer said in a statement.

The auction house is offering the papers for individual sale. They are expected to fetch a price of 40,000 to 60,000 British pounds ($54,220 to $81,324) for the copy of "On Computable Numbers," which introduced the idea of a "universal computing machine," and a similar price for the signed dissertation.

“We even have Turing's first published paper from 1935 – Equivalence of Left and Right Almost Periodicity – which is simply a single sheet of paper," Spencer said.

Ethel Turing made her gift to Routledge in May 1956, nearly two years after Turing died at age 41 on June 7, 1954. After a brilliant career at Princeton University, where he earned his doctorate, and Bletchley Park, the U.K.'s code-breaking agency, Turing worked at the U.K.'s National Physical Laboratory and the University of Manchester, where he designed some of the first forerunners of today's computers.

But in 1952, while reporting a burglary, he acknowledged a sexual relationship with another man to police and was persecuted under an 1885 law that criminalized homosexual acts as "gross indecency." To avoid prison, he was forced to submit to chemical castration — doses of estrogen that had a feminizing effect. He was also denied entry into the United States.

Turing was found dead in his home of cyanide poisoning, which may have been a result of suicide or an accident resulting from a chemistry experiment he was running at the time. His case inspired a 2009 apology from the British government and a 2017 law, known as the "Alan Turing Law," that retroactively pardons people convicted under historical legislation in England and Wales for homosexual acts.

Dan Da Dan returns for an even more satisfying spectacle of supernatural and occult shenanigans as Jiji experiences a monstrous metamorphosis.

There's an exciting, electric feeling whenever a series concludes a near-flawless freshman season that can quickly turn to dread when the prospect of topping that next year is considered. Dan Da Dan was far and away 2024's pop culture juggernaut, thanks to its effortless mix of horror, science fiction, and coming of age rom-com bliss. There's an inherent challenge to sequels — or second seasons — which is why there are so many properties that start out strong, but ultimately leak quality over time. Dan Da Dan avoids these expected pitfalls and delivers something that must be seen to be believed — just like some urban legend cryptid.

Dan Da Dan: Evil Eye tells a strong story that proves the first season's magic wasn't a fluke and that the next batch of episodes are likely to surpass the previous season's greatest heights, just like how Evil Eye surpasses the other cinematic compilation, Dan Da Dan: First Encounter. Dan Da Dan's first season was so successful that it wouldn't have been difficult for the anime to coast on this energy and deliver more of the same. Thankfully, Evil Eye prides itself on its ability to go for broke. It's the proper heightening of storytelling, stakes, and character relationships that you'd hope for from a show's second season. Evil Eye is everything fans want from Dan Da Dan, while also throwing in a few things that they never knew they needed.

Dan Da Dan: Evil Eye is an odds and ends amalgamation of season one's finale and season two's first three episodes that begins with a sizzle reel of highlights from last season. Evil Eye adopts a curious approach where season one's finale immediately feeds into new material, albeit in a slightly revised manner that's not so clear cut. The two are inexorably intertwined and turned into something original that doesn't cheat its way out of what happened in the finale, but still effectively builds upon it with a more effective and narratively suspenseful presentation of events.



Dan Da Dan: Evil Eye and the anime's second season would be facing an uphill battle under any circumstances after its knockout freshman year. The series finds itself at an especially crucial inflection point as Momo and Okarun's duo becomes a trio with Jiji. Many series fumble as they expand their core cast, yet Jiji becomes Evil Eye‘s secret weapon, both figuratively and literally. Jiji was a recent addition who came in at the end of Dan Da Dan's first season and put a huge wrench in Momo and Okarun's budding prospective romance. 

Jiji was a delight during these introductory episodes, but Evil Eye is really Jiji's time to shine and a proper showcase for the newer character. Jiji may have seemed abrasive to the Momo/Okarun shippers and set up to fail in some respects. However, it's hard not to be a Jiji fan after the burst of affable character development that he experiences here. He's just such a ray of sunshine in human Labrador form. Jiji feels just as important and beloved as Momo and Okarun by the end of Evil Eye, which is no small feat.

Dan Da Dan has showcased a wide range of supernatural disturbances across its first season between aliens, spirits, crab men, and more. This trend continues in Evil Eye with the creepy Kito family, outrageous elderly landlords who are another strong example of terrifying occult creatures who have mundane, normalized attitudes so they feel more like put-upon people instead of folkloric monsters. There's a fascinating energy to the Kito family and the predatory dynamic that they have over Jiji. 

The Kito family tap into an energy that's honestly akin to home invasion horror where innocent characters are desperate to break free, but forced to carry out the sick whims of twisted interlopers. The Kitos' macabre aggression with Jiji often brings Funny Games or even The Texas Chain Saw Massacre's Sawyer family to mind. It's a good fit for Dan Da Dan that effortlessly meshes with the anime's reverence towards iconic horror and sci-fi texts, but it's also a style and subgenre that wasn't explored during season one.



Momo's fight against the Kito family is thrilling and reminiscent of combat that's ripped out of Stephen Chow's Kung Fu Hustle. That being said, the Kito are easily the least interesting of Dan Da Dan's supernatural antagonists to date. They're a perfunctory obstacle and the decision to repeatedly threaten Momo with sexual danger grows progressively weaker and more manipulative each time it's done. There are some great set-pieces around these enemies, but it feels like they really could have been triggered by any occult obstacle. Drama is born out of the Kitos' victory over Okarun and Jiji, which pushes Momo into a difficult situation. However, giving the Kito family greater authority so that they actually defeat Okarun and Jiji might have helped these monsters stand out a little more. 

The Kito may slightly lack impact, but they're merely an aperitif for Evil Eye's main event – the giant Kuragari Serpent Lord –  a Mongolian Death Worm – who definitely doesn't disappoint. This creature was actually teased during the tail end of season one. However, it's a monster that exceeds expectations even without Dan Da Dan neatly connecting these dots. Dan Da Dan has been rich in disturbing creature designs and the Great Serpent Lord indulges in uncomfortable Eldritch imagery that feels appropriate for this unexplainable and all-encompassing invader. The anime continues to effortlessly blend actual folklore and urban legends with gripping action storytelling.



The Great Serpent Lord also emits powerful psychic waves that culminate in what's easily one of Dan Da Dan's most unnerving sequences. There's a reverence to this monstrosity that praises him like some sick God. This threat intensifies as Kuragari — the Evil Eye — battles against the heroic trio. Evil Eye, in many ways, is Dan Da Dan's most dangerous enemy yet and he wields a fatal Medusa-esque power. It's a deeply dark idea that teases a more mature and emotionally intense second season ahead. 

Looking beyond the occult action, Evil Eye is an utterly gorgeous film that's on par with anything from season one. However, there are some particular highlights, such as Momo's fight against the Kito or the heightened spectacle that concludes the movie. Most of these moments involve Momo, yet Okarun is still essential and there's a satisfying sense of growth when it comes to their respective skills. Momo and Okarun's personal friendship and emotional bond evolve just as much as their increasingly confident combat skills.



Dan Da Dan has also quietly made a name for itself with its over-the-top chase sequences, which have practically become one of the anime's signatures. Evil Eye doesn't disappoint in this regard and it features a Jiji-driven destructive pursuit that's destined to become a classic. This story turns to more stylized visuals for its emotional moments, like heightened watercolors that dominate melancholy flashbacks. The film's final fight is especially vibrant and accented by kaleidoscopic neon colors and kinetic images. It's such a beautiful and visually inventive expression from Science Saru that reiterates why Dan Da Dan is currently one of the best in the biz when it comes to creative shonen action. You'll curse your eyes for needing to blink and missing a single frame of mayhem.

There's a satisfying sense of closure that's reached by the end of the three episodes that comprise this movie. This feels like a complete story, albeit one that still ends on a cliffhanger. That being said, Dan Da Dan: Evil Eye is a movie that amounts to far more than merely an extended tease for season two. If nothing else, it's just so much fun to spend time with these characters, watch them gain ground, and become more powerful in this beautifully unique universe. Evil Eye is the must-see anime event of the season, whether it's enjoyed in theaters or in piecemeal when season two begins.



‘Dandadan: Evil Eye' is now playing in select theaters.

Season 2 premieres July 3, 2025 on Netflix.

Daniel Kurland is a freelance writer, comedian, and critic, whose work can be read on Splitsider, Bloody Disgusting, Den of Geek, ScreenRant, and across the Internet. 

Daniel knows that "Psycho II" is better than the original and that the last season of "The X-Files" doesn't deserve the bile that it conjures. If you want a drink thrown in your face, talk to him about "Silent Night, Deadly Night Part II," but he'll always happily talk about the "Puppet Master" franchise.

Dylan Thuras: It was 1988, and all year, Jim Weiner had been having a terrible time sleeping. He was having nightmares, but these were not normal nightmares, because Jim said he felt like he was awake, almost like it was some kind of sleep paralysis.

He'd wake up to the overwhelming sense that there was someone in the room with him. He'd hear a flurry of voices, but he couldn't understand them. He couldn't move anything but his eyes. And often, his twin brother Jack was there, along with two college friends, Chuck and Charlie.

Jim would be lying on this table in a bright white room. At first, Jim thought he knew what was causing this strange, awful sensation. Years earlier, he'd been in a bad accident. He'd injured his spine and his brainstem. He told his psychiatrist, it seems like things were under control.

They were going to get better. But then Jim got on the phone with his brother Jack, and they made a very unnerving discovery.

This was happening to Jack too. The bright white room, the table, Charlie and Chuck, the paralysis. Jack said he was seeing the same things. And as they dug deeper, the brothers would trace this strange sensation to an incident that happened more than a decade earlier, in the north woods of Maine, in the Allagash Wilderness Waterway.

I'm Dylan Thuras, and this is Atlas Obscura. And today, we are talking UFOs. We are talking alien abductions. And we're doing it National Parks style.

This is an edited transcript of the Atlas Obscura Podcast: a celebration of the world's strange, incredible, and wondrous places. Find the show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major podcast apps.

Dylan: National Parks are pretty much universally beloved. You have to be, like, a pretty unpleasant person to really dislike National Parks. But there's also this other side to these enormous wild places. People die or disappear in National Parks actually pretty frequently. I don't say this to discourage anyone from visiting the parks. Millions and millions of people go there. They are wonderful. They are safe. They are amazing. But they are big and they are wild. And there's a hidden side to everything, including these places that we revere. So I am here today with two people who know more about the dark and sinister side of National Parks than I would guess almost anyone else. Danielle LaRock and Cassie Yahnian are hosts of the podcast National Park After Dark, a podcast for the morbid outdoor enthusiast, which is not a thing that I knew I was until I heard your work. So, Danielle, Cassie, thanks for coming on the show.

Danielle LaRock: Thank you so much for the lovely introduction.

Cassie Yahnian: Yes. We're excited to be here.

Dylan: It's great. Meeting of the morbid outdoor enthusiasts. Yeah, so where are you two right now in the world? You look like you are in nice places.

Danielle: I'm in Maine.

Dylan: Oh, great.

Cassie: Yeah, and I'm in Vermont.

Dylan: Oh, nice. Yeah, this is great. I went to college in Bennington.

Cassie: Oh, very cool. Bennington's a very cool area.

Dylan: Yeah. It's also actually a place where there's like all these weird, mysterious disappearances. The like, little Bennington Triangle. It's like a whole—we could do a whole other thing.

Danielle: There's some vibes happening.

Dylan: There's some vibes. There are some vibes in that Bennington Triangle. And we're going to get back to Jack and Jim's story in just a second. But to further set the mood, why don't you give me a quick lightning round of a few of your favorite morbid stories that have taken place in national parks. Danielle, go.

Danielle: Okay. Everglades National Park. In the 1800s, bird populations were being decimated for fashion and one of the first men who tried to save them was killed for it.

Cassie: Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park. A backcountry ranger went missing while out on patrol and then the largest search operation ever recorded in those parks uncovered a complicated marriage, a mistress, and reasons he may have wanted to disappear.

Danielle: Joshua Tree National Park. Graham Parsons' friends wanted him to go out like he lived: as a rock star. After his untimely end, they stole his body from a plane, loaded it into a friend's hearse, drove it into Joshua Tree, and attempted a makeshift cremation.

Dylan: It makes me think the cremation went poorly.

Cassie: It did.

Dylan: That's a lot of, like, death, murder, mayhem in national parks. It just makes me feel like people, I don't know, maybe there's just something about national parks where people feel like they can get away with things. So, okay, let's talk about one of these cases. Let's get back to our brothers, Jim and Jack. And this story takes place in the Allagash Wilderness, which is technically not a national park, but an enormous state park in Maine. More than a decade before the brothers are having these strange visions, back in 1976, Jack and Jim are in their 20s. And what's going on with them? What sort of precipitates all of this stuff that happens later?

Danielle: Yeah, so you set the scene so brilliantly, so let's pick up from there. In August of 1976, the twins, Jim and Jack, along with Charlie Foltz and Chuck Rak, were in the midst of a two-week camping trip and fishing trip along the Allagash Waterway. The area, like you said, is part of the National Wild and Scenic River System. For anyone who has not been to Maine or Northern Maine, it's absolutely beautiful. It's super remote, and this area in particular is about 93 miles long worth of ribbons of lakes and streams, and it's just so beautiful. And the four of them had prepared for this trip for nearly a year beforehand, prepping, researching, getting ready to go. So at this point in time, they're dropped off in the wilderness by a bush plane, and they began their journey.

Dylan: And you said they got dropped off by a plane. So, I mean, they're, like, totally alone out there. It's, like, not the place you would bump into a random stranger. They seem quite far out in the wilderness.

Danielle: You can't just drive or walk up to a place like this. You need to intentionally seek it out. There's a few other campers around, moreso people that are doing a similar thing, right? So, canoers and paddlers—actually, this day, they run into another group of campers on a lake that they are also planning to camp on. And they had lost—one of the teenagers in their group had gotten separated and hadn't come back to their campsite yet. So, they actually offered to search for him. And this is when kind of the prelude happens to the encounter. And they're picking up binoculars, they're scanning this lake for the teenager. That's when the entire group all initially spot something strange that they, at first, just kind of write off as, ah, that's a weird, strange light in the sky.

Dylan: What do they see?

Danielle: So, when they're scanning the tree line, they're looking through binoculars. All of these people see this bright light, and it was in the eastern part of the sky, and it was moving slightly. And at first, they collectively thought they were maybe looking at Mars because it had this reddish tint to it. But suddenly, they all kind of look at each other like, this is weird. Because not only did everyone notice it, it was astoundingly bright. It seemed to be hovering about 200 feet from the top of the tree line. And then it all of a sudden, as they describe it, inverted on itself. So, it closed in kind of like an eyelid shutting, and then it blinked out from sight.

Dylan: That's not—that's slightly unnerving. Did they ever find the people they were looking for?

Danielle: Yes. The kid came back, and it was fine. And then they all went their separate ways and never saw each other again.

Dylan: Right. So, this sort of strange thing happens as they're looking for this lost camper, and they find the camper. Seems like that was not the end of things. What do they do after they have that first experience?

Cassie: So, later that evening, after settling into camp and making a large fire on the lake shore, the men decided that they wanted to go back onto the lake and do a night paddle. And that night was pretty eerie and quiet. They actually kind of noticed how dark it was and how quiet things were. And while Chuck was paddling, he suddenly felt like something was off, and he really felt like he could feel someone watching him. So, he threw his gaze over his shoulder, and he saw this ball of light rising from the trees about 200 yards away. Jim, Jack, and Charlie, they all turned around at this point to look, and a large round bright light was rising more above this tree line. It ascended roughly 300 feet, and then it hovered. It fluctuated between red, green, and yellow, and it wasn't solid, but rather had an almost liquid appearance to it.

Dylan: I would be pretty highly alarmed here if this is what was going on.

Danielle: So, after they all noticed this light rising up, they noticed a couple of things. First of all, it's way closer than whatever they saw hours prior. It is illuminating the entire forest, and it's dead silent. Chuck decides to lean down, grab his flashlight, points it at this source of light, and clicks the flashlight on and off in the universal, at least earthly, signal for SOS. And suddenly, this light source emits a light source of its own, kind of like a searchlight, and starts scanning the water, and it's moving in their direction. So, now, collectively, all the men are having this oh crap moment.

Dylan: Yeah, at this point.

Danielle: And start paddling like crazy back to their camp. So, they get back to the shoreline, but interestingly, there's a chunk of time that they can't recall, at least at first. So, they all remember seeing this light and turning to paddle back to shore, and then the next thing they remember is skidding up onto the shoreline to their campsite, where just 20 minutes prior, they had set a huge fire. And their fire is now smoldering, just smoldering coals. So, they clocked that as strange, and they kind of talked amongst each other for a brief minute about, huh, that was kind of weird, right? And then they all remember feeling like they were in this daze, and kind of equated it to after you come out of anesthesia, you're awake and you're conscious, but you're loopy and kind of scatterbrained. And they just went to sleep. The next day, they get up, they ran into a ranger, actually, and inquired if, you know, did you see anything like that? What was that?

Dylan: Yeah, what could that have been?

Danielle: Yeah. And he actually said, well, you know, there's a new hardware store out in Millinocket that had those, you know, those big Hollywood floodlights. And, you know, that is dozens of miles away. It does not match the description of what they encountered. So, they kind of said, oh, okay. Like, sure, that sounds like it. Thanks.

Dylan: Yeah, the local hardware store opening, you know, yeah, right.

Danielle: That must be it, right. But, yeah, so anyways, after that, they kind of dropped it, surprisingly. They continued their trip. They went on with their entire lives. They went back to school. They graduated. They had families. And like you said at the beginning, you know, decades go by. We're now in 1988 where this is starting to surface again.

Dylan: Okay, so we are back to where we started. Jim is having these crazy night visions. He talks to his brother, Jack. They realize that they're maybe experiencing the same thing. How does this all sort of start to connect for them? How do they start to realize that maybe there's something more to this past experience than what they initially thought?

Cassie: Well, then they ended up contacting Chuck and Charlie to speak about that night again, to be like, hey, are you experiencing any of this? Like, we're both having these weird dreams. Are you? And then it turned out that all of them were experiencing the same thing, and it was kind of that moment where they're like, wait, we forgot about this. We kind of pushed it to the side, but maybe there's something more here that we didn't realize.

Dylan: Yeah.

Danielle: And surprisingly, you know, you mentioned that Jim's physicians initially said, hey, we're going to recommend you for further help. And of all people, they recommend him to a ufologist. And that ufologist is the one that recommended they start doing some regression hypnotherapy. All four of the men agreed to do that. And separately, they start to uncover eerily similar experiences of lost memories from that evening.

Dylan: To quickly recap, Jim, Jack, Chuck, Charlie, they go on this trip in the 70s, they've got this crazy experience with these floating lights, they kind of lose time, which is like classic UFO stuff, you know, you're like, I was only gone for five minutes, what do you mean? And then a decade later, they end up talking to this alien researcher, they do this hypnotic regression therapy. And over the course of that two years, they all end up with this sort of picture, or they converge on this understanding, of what happened. So what do they end up saying happened during that key, like missing period?

Danielle: Yeah. So long story short: They all—after two years—they come to realize that under hypnosis, they were finding out the same things. Essentially, they all recalled being aboard a spacecraft, where they were all subjected to different medical examinations by some of these humanoid entities. They all described them as having large heads, dark eyes, slender bodies, they don't speak with words, but rather telepathically send messages to them. And that was what was coming up also in their dreams and starting to kind of surface that way.

Dylan: Right. Yeah, what you're describing sounds a lot like the visions that Jim described having 10 years later.

Danielle: Yeah. Now they're all under the impression of, wow, we were gone for hours. We thought it was minutes. And we were abducted by aliens and experimented on and placed back into our canoe and sent on our way.

Dylan: And they like, they ended up, you know, sort of becoming a little bit famous, right?

Danielle: Yeah. And to be clear, you know, there, at first they were very scared. They were—this was traumatic memories for them. This was not something they looked back on fondly. After this collective understanding of this is a shared experience, or at least that's what they were under the impression of, they come to this sort of solace that, you know, this happened and let's own it and let's start talking about it. And that's what they did. And for years, they went on different speaking circuits. They talk a lot at different UFO conferences.

Dylan: Yeah, right. They became known as the Allagash Four, this kind of like, you know, group of abductees who could just talk about this experience and kind of shared it. But then later, later, I think it's Charlie, was it Chuck or Charlie? Who came forward?

Danielle: Chuck. Chuck was the one.

Dylan: Okay. Yeah. Chuck came forward and said, basically, yeah, some of this is bullshit, or like, we made some of this up. Like, did he actually say it was a hoax or was he sort of just like walking back some of it?

Danielle: He walked back some of it. So, his stance was that the incident with the other campers and seeing that strange light was true.

Dylan: Yeah.

Danielle: And also their experience on the lake, just the four of them, was true. Where he started to go off on his own was saying that the abduction part was fabricated. But the other guys point to, yeah, well, the only reason he's saying that now after years of us going on Joan Rivers and doing different television programs and all of this and wanting to write books, and the only reason he's saying that is because we had a big falling out in our friendship.

Dylan: I mean, I have to ask the question, what do you two think? You guys spend a lot of time out, way out in the wilderness, you know, under the night sky. I mean, are you believers?

Cassie: It would be very unbelievable for me to think that we are the only planet with life on it. You know? I think that it is way more unrealistic to think that we are the only people or life forms that exist in the entire universe.

Dylan: What about you, Danielle?

Danielle: I co-sign all of that.

Dylan: Have you two ever seen anything truly weird and unexplainable on any of your adventures?

Danielle: I saw Starlink and thought it was UFOs.

Dylan: I know so many people who were convinced they were seeing an alien invasion, but were just 100 percent seeing Starlink. Like, what is that? That's funny. Yes. It's super interesting. I don't know what I think. Maybe I'm more of a skeptic than you two. I have some mixed feelings. It's clear that, like, for some of these kind of abductee cases, like, something is going on. People are having very intense and genuinely traumatic experiences. They are experiencing something real for them. And I can't help but note that when all this is happening, like the late 80s and the early 90s, this is an absolute alien craze, right? The X-Files has just started. All of this stuff is happening on TV about, like, Area 51. There's, like, nothing hotter than kind of, like, weird aliens. I think it's possible, you know, they're doing this hypnotic regression therapy. And one of the big critiques of this is that it can, like, implant memories. And the person who did this to them also, like, wrote a book about it, and I think probably did pretty well on that book. I honestly don't know. It seems likely that they saw something very strange, to which I have no explanation of.

Danielle: So now that we're all kind of coming around to the government being like, yeah, aliens are real, you know, that's not new.

Dylan: Or at least we don't know what any of this stuff is. Like, we can't tell you or we don't know.

Danielle: Right. We can't confirm nor deny. But you know, now, as time goes on, we're starting to accept that aliens might be real. Whether or not they're the gray aliens that we think of when we imagine an alien, or if they're something completely different, we're coming around to the thought that we aren't alone in the universe.

Dylan: Interesting. Yeah, I think one of the things I like about this story is just that, especially when you're out there in the wilderness at night on your own, whatever—sometimes I do these bike rides, these, like, late night bike rides that go, it's like a full moon ride, and we all go look at the full moon, it's really nice—and I'm riding through a really familiar trail, but I'm riding at night, my little flashlight is shining. And the whole thing just starts to take on this other terrifying kind of aspect. And I can't really explain it. It's not rational. But I just, I do think that sometimes we just have experiences that we cannot explain. And there's something about being in the woods at night that just evokes those kinds of experiences. And I almost don't feel like I need an explanation to understand that feeling of: something is happening that I can't quite explain. How has covering all this affected your relationship with national parks and wilderness areas? Does it ever freak you out? Do you, you know, at night, camping out somewhere far away, are you, like, flashing back to these stories? Or are you kind of like, this is what we live for?

Cassie: Sometimes. I mean, yeah, for sure. There are, I think, on the brighter side, sometimes these stories, I like to feel like I am more prepared and more knowledgeable. But on the other side, when I have extensively researched a grizzly bear mauling, I cannot help but worry when I'm sleeping outdoors in grizzly territory.

Dylan: Also, a grizzly is not—that's a reasonable thing to be afraid of in a national park. That's quite a practical, real thing to be like, yeah, don't attract the grizzly to the tent. Danielle, how about you?

Danielle: I definitely am way more aware of my surroundings, but I'm trying to adopt her mantra of whatever's happening outside of the tent is none of my business.

Dylan: Yeah, good. Whatever that weird sound was, don't worry about it.

Danielle: Right.

Dylan: That was Danielle LaRock and Cassie Yahnian. They are the hosts of a really delightful, sometimes terrifying podcast called National Park After Dark. It's basically kind of true crime survival adventure in national parks. And you can find it wherever you get your podcast. It is really delightful. Give it a listen.

Dylan Thuras: It was 1988, and all year, Jim Weiner had been having a terrible time sleeping. He was having nightmares, but these were not normal nightmares, because Jim said he felt like he was awake, almost like it was some kind of sleep paralysis.

He'd wake up to the overwhelming sense that there was someone in the room with him. He'd hear a flurry of voices, but he couldn't understand them. He couldn't move anything but his eyes. And often, his twin brother Jack was there, along with two college friends, Chuck and Charlie.

Jim would be lying on this table in a bright white room. At first, Jim thought he knew what was causing this strange, awful sensation. Years earlier, he'd been in a bad accident. He'd injured his spine and his brainstem. He told his psychiatrist, it seems like things were under control.

They were going to get better. But then Jim got on the phone with his brother Jack, and they made a very unnerving discovery.

This was happening to Jack too. The bright white room, the table, Charlie and Chuck, the paralysis. Jack said he was seeing the same things. And as they dug deeper, the brothers would trace this strange sensation to an incident that happened more than a decade earlier, in the north woods of Maine, in the Allagash Wilderness Waterway.

I'm Dylan Thuras, and this is Atlas Obscura. And today, we are talking UFOs. We are talking alien abductions. And we're doing it National Parks style.

This is an edited transcript of the Atlas Obscura Podcast: a celebration of the world's strange, incredible, and wondrous places. Find the show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major podcast apps.

Dylan: National Parks are pretty much universally beloved. You have to be, like, a pretty unpleasant person to really dislike National Parks. But there's also this other side to these enormous wild places. People die or disappear in National Parks actually pretty frequently. I don't say this to discourage anyone from visiting the parks. Millions and millions of people go there. They are wonderful. They are safe. They are amazing. But they are big and they are wild. And there's a hidden side to everything, including these places that we revere. So I am here today with two people who know more about the dark and sinister side of National Parks than I would guess almost anyone else. Danielle LaRock and Cassie Yahnian are hosts of the podcast National Park After Dark, a podcast for the morbid outdoor enthusiast, which is not a thing that I knew I was until I heard your work. So, Danielle, Cassie, thanks for coming on the show.

Danielle LaRock: Thank you so much for the lovely introduction.

Cassie Yahnian: Yes. We're excited to be here.

Dylan: It's great. Meeting of the morbid outdoor enthusiasts. Yeah, so where are you two right now in the world? You look like you are in nice places.

Danielle: I'm in Maine.

Dylan: Oh, great.

Cassie: Yeah, and I'm in Vermont.

Dylan: Oh, nice. Yeah, this is great. I went to college in Bennington.

Cassie: Oh, very cool. Bennington's a very cool area.

Dylan: Yeah. It's also actually a place where there's like all these weird, mysterious disappearances. The like, little Bennington Triangle. It's like a whole—we could do a whole other thing.

Danielle: There's some vibes happening.

Dylan: There's some vibes. There are some vibes in that Bennington Triangle. And we're going to get back to Jack and Jim's story in just a second. But to further set the mood, why don't you give me a quick lightning round of a few of your favorite morbid stories that have taken place in national parks. Danielle, go.

Danielle: Okay. Everglades National Park. In the 1800s, bird populations were being decimated for fashion and one of the first men who tried to save them was killed for it.

Cassie: Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park. A backcountry ranger went missing while out on patrol and then the largest search operation ever recorded in those parks uncovered a complicated marriage, a mistress, and reasons he may have wanted to disappear.

Danielle: Joshua Tree National Park. Graham Parsons' friends wanted him to go out like he lived: as a rock star. After his untimely end, they stole his body from a plane, loaded it into a friend's hearse, drove it into Joshua Tree, and attempted a makeshift cremation.

Dylan: It makes me think the cremation went poorly.

Cassie: It did.

Dylan: That's a lot of, like, death, murder, mayhem in national parks. It just makes me feel like people, I don't know, maybe there's just something about national parks where people feel like they can get away with things. So, okay, let's talk about one of these cases. Let's get back to our brothers, Jim and Jack. And this story takes place in the Allagash Wilderness, which is technically not a national park, but an enormous state park in Maine. More than a decade before the brothers are having these strange visions, back in 1976, Jack and Jim are in their 20s. And what's going on with them? What sort of precipitates all of this stuff that happens later?

Danielle: Yeah, so you set the scene so brilliantly, so let's pick up from there. In August of 1976, the twins, Jim and Jack, along with Charlie Foltz and Chuck Rak, were in the midst of a two-week camping trip and fishing trip along the Allagash Waterway. The area, like you said, is part of the National Wild and Scenic River System. For anyone who has not been to Maine or Northern Maine, it's absolutely beautiful. It's super remote, and this area in particular is about 93 miles long worth of ribbons of lakes and streams, and it's just so beautiful. And the four of them had prepared for this trip for nearly a year beforehand, prepping, researching, getting ready to go. So at this point in time, they're dropped off in the wilderness by a bush plane, and they began their journey.

Dylan: And you said they got dropped off by a plane. So, I mean, they're, like, totally alone out there. It's, like, not the place you would bump into a random stranger. They seem quite far out in the wilderness.

Danielle: You can't just drive or walk up to a place like this. You need to intentionally seek it out. There's a few other campers around, moreso people that are doing a similar thing, right? So, canoers and paddlers—actually, this day, they run into another group of campers on a lake that they are also planning to camp on. And they had lost—one of the teenagers in their group had gotten separated and hadn't come back to their campsite yet. So, they actually offered to search for him. And this is when kind of the prelude happens to the encounter. And they're picking up binoculars, they're scanning this lake for the teenager. That's when the entire group all initially spot something strange that they, at first, just kind of write off as, ah, that's a weird, strange light in the sky.

Dylan: What do they see?

Danielle: So, when they're scanning the tree line, they're looking through binoculars. All of these people see this bright light, and it was in the eastern part of the sky, and it was moving slightly. And at first, they collectively thought they were maybe looking at Mars because it had this reddish tint to it. But suddenly, they all kind of look at each other like, this is weird. Because not only did everyone notice it, it was astoundingly bright. It seemed to be hovering about 200 feet from the top of the tree line. And then it all of a sudden, as they describe it, inverted on itself. So, it closed in kind of like an eyelid shutting, and then it blinked out from sight.

Dylan: That's not—that's slightly unnerving. Did they ever find the people they were looking for?

Danielle: Yes. The kid came back, and it was fine. And then they all went their separate ways and never saw each other again.

Dylan: Right. So, this sort of strange thing happens as they're looking for this lost camper, and they find the camper. Seems like that was not the end of things. What do they do after they have that first experience?

Cassie: So, later that evening, after settling into camp and making a large fire on the lake shore, the men decided that they wanted to go back onto the lake and do a night paddle. And that night was pretty eerie and quiet. They actually kind of noticed how dark it was and how quiet things were. And while Chuck was paddling, he suddenly felt like something was off, and he really felt like he could feel someone watching him. So, he threw his gaze over his shoulder, and he saw this ball of light rising from the trees about 200 yards away. Jim, Jack, and Charlie, they all turned around at this point to look, and a large round bright light was rising more above this tree line. It ascended roughly 300 feet, and then it hovered. It fluctuated between red, green, and yellow, and it wasn't solid, but rather had an almost liquid appearance to it.

Dylan: I would be pretty highly alarmed here if this is what was going on.

Danielle: So, after they all noticed this light rising up, they noticed a couple of things. First of all, it's way closer than whatever they saw hours prior. It is illuminating the entire forest, and it's dead silent. Chuck decides to lean down, grab his flashlight, points it at this source of light, and clicks the flashlight on and off in the universal, at least earthly, signal for SOS. And suddenly, this light source emits a light source of its own, kind of like a searchlight, and starts scanning the water, and it's moving in their direction. So, now, collectively, all the men are having this oh crap moment.

Dylan: Yeah, at this point.

Danielle: And start paddling like crazy back to their camp. So, they get back to the shoreline, but interestingly, there's a chunk of time that they can't recall, at least at first. So, they all remember seeing this light and turning to paddle back to shore, and then the next thing they remember is skidding up onto the shoreline to their campsite, where just 20 minutes prior, they had set a huge fire. And their fire is now smoldering, just smoldering coals. So, they clocked that as strange, and they kind of talked amongst each other for a brief minute about, huh, that was kind of weird, right? And then they all remember feeling like they were in this daze, and kind of equated it to after you come out of anesthesia, you're awake and you're conscious, but you're loopy and kind of scatterbrained. And they just went to sleep. The next day, they get up, they ran into a ranger, actually, and inquired if, you know, did you see anything like that? What was that?

Dylan: Yeah, what could that have been?

Danielle: Yeah. And he actually said, well, you know, there's a new hardware store out in Millinocket that had those, you know, those big Hollywood floodlights. And, you know, that is dozens of miles away. It does not match the description of what they encountered. So, they kind of said, oh, okay. Like, sure, that sounds like it. Thanks.

Dylan: Yeah, the local hardware store opening, you know, yeah, right.

Danielle: That must be it, right. But, yeah, so anyways, after that, they kind of dropped it, surprisingly. They continued their trip. They went on with their entire lives. They went back to school. They graduated. They had families. And like you said at the beginning, you know, decades go by. We're now in 1988 where this is starting to surface again.

Dylan: Okay, so we are back to where we started. Jim is having these crazy night visions. He talks to his brother, Jack. They realize that they're maybe experiencing the same thing. How does this all sort of start to connect for them? How do they start to realize that maybe there's something more to this past experience than what they initially thought?

Cassie: Well, then they ended up contacting Chuck and Charlie to speak about that night again, to be like, hey, are you experiencing any of this? Like, we're both having these weird dreams. Are you? And then it turned out that all of them were experiencing the same thing, and it was kind of that moment where they're like, wait, we forgot about this. We kind of pushed it to the side, but maybe there's something more here that we didn't realize.

Dylan: Yeah.

Danielle: And surprisingly, you know, you mentioned that Jim's physicians initially said, hey, we're going to recommend you for further help. And of all people, they recommend him to a ufologist. And that ufologist is the one that recommended they start doing some regression hypnotherapy. All four of the men agreed to do that. And separately, they start to uncover eerily similar experiences of lost memories from that evening.

Dylan: To quickly recap, Jim, Jack, Chuck, Charlie, they go on this trip in the 70s, they've got this crazy experience with these floating lights, they kind of lose time, which is like classic UFO stuff, you know, you're like, I was only gone for five minutes, what do you mean? And then a decade later, they end up talking to this alien researcher, they do this hypnotic regression therapy. And over the course of that two years, they all end up with this sort of picture, or they converge on this understanding, of what happened. So what do they end up saying happened during that key, like missing period?

Danielle: Yeah. So long story short: They all—after two years—they come to realize that under hypnosis, they were finding out the same things. Essentially, they all recalled being aboard a spacecraft, where they were all subjected to different medical examinations by some of these humanoid entities. They all described them as having large heads, dark eyes, slender bodies, they don't speak with words, but rather telepathically send messages to them. And that was what was coming up also in their dreams and starting to kind of surface that way.

Dylan: Right. Yeah, what you're describing sounds a lot like the visions that Jim described having 10 years later.

Danielle: Yeah. Now they're all under the impression of, wow, we were gone for hours. We thought it was minutes. And we were abducted by aliens and experimented on and placed back into our canoe and sent on our way.

Dylan: And they like, they ended up, you know, sort of becoming a little bit famous, right?

Danielle: Yeah. And to be clear, you know, there, at first they were very scared. They were—this was traumatic memories for them. This was not something they looked back on fondly. After this collective understanding of this is a shared experience, or at least that's what they were under the impression of, they come to this sort of solace that, you know, this happened and let's own it and let's start talking about it. And that's what they did. And for years, they went on different speaking circuits. They talk a lot at different UFO conferences.

Dylan: Yeah, right. They became known as the Allagash Four, this kind of like, you know, group of abductees who could just talk about this experience and kind of shared it. But then later, later, I think it's Charlie, was it Chuck or Charlie? Who came forward?

Danielle: Chuck. Chuck was the one.

Dylan: Okay. Yeah. Chuck came forward and said, basically, yeah, some of this is bullshit, or like, we made some of this up. Like, did he actually say it was a hoax or was he sort of just like walking back some of it?

Danielle: He walked back some of it. So, his stance was that the incident with the other campers and seeing that strange light was true.

Dylan: Yeah.

Danielle: And also their experience on the lake, just the four of them, was true. Where he started to go off on his own was saying that the abduction part was fabricated. But the other guys point to, yeah, well, the only reason he's saying that now after years of us going on Joan Rivers and doing different television programs and all of this and wanting to write books, and the only reason he's saying that is because we had a big falling out in our friendship.

Dylan: I mean, I have to ask the question, what do you two think? You guys spend a lot of time out, way out in the wilderness, you know, under the night sky. I mean, are you believers?

Cassie: It would be very unbelievable for me to think that we are the only planet with life on it. You know? I think that it is way more unrealistic to think that we are the only people or life forms that exist in the entire universe.

Dylan: What about you, Danielle?

Danielle: I co-sign all of that.

Dylan: Have you two ever seen anything truly weird and unexplainable on any of your adventures?

Danielle: I saw Starlink and thought it was UFOs.

Dylan: I know so many people who were convinced they were seeing an alien invasion, but were just 100 percent seeing Starlink. Like, what is that? That's funny. Yes. It's super interesting. I don't know what I think. Maybe I'm more of a skeptic than you two. I have some mixed feelings. It's clear that, like, for some of these kind of abductee cases, like, something is going on. People are having very intense and genuinely traumatic experiences. They are experiencing something real for them. And I can't help but note that when all this is happening, like the late 80s and the early 90s, this is an absolute alien craze, right? The X-Files has just started.

A war of words between SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump could lead to significant fallout for U.S.-led space exploration.

An explosive, and very public, feud between President Donald Trump and SpaceX founder Elon Musk on Thursday (June 5) has raised doubts over the future of America's space industry.

The war of words could place $22 billion of SpaceX's government contracts with multiple U.S. space programs at risk, according to one estimate, although the real figure — which remains classified — could be significantly higher.

Following threats from the president on his social media platform Truth Social that the U.S. could cancel the government contracts and subsidies awarded to Musk's companies, the CEO of SpaceX retorted that his space company would "begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately."

Hours later, Musk responded to a follower telling him to "cool off" by saying "Good advice. Ok, we won't decommission Dragon."

The disagreement began on Tuesday (June 3) when Musk criticized the administration's proposed tax and spending bill on his social media platform X.

"This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it," Musk wrote on X.

This then escalated into a full-blown social media feud on Thursday, with Musk claiming that Trump's name appears in unreleased files relating to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The White House condemned these allegations. "This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted," representatives wrote on X.

Trump then claimed Musk "just went CRAZY," posting: "The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!"

SpaceX's Dragon capsule is a reusable spacecraft capable of carrying up to seven passengers and cargo to and from Earth orbit, according to SpaceX. NASA currently relies on the capsule to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS), so canceling these government contracts effectively eliminates America's ability to launch astronauts to space from American soil, Live Science's sister website, Space.com, reported.

NASA also heavily relies on SpaceX for other space programs, having selected the Starship Human Landing System (HLS), a lunar lander variant of the company's next-generation Starship spacecraft, to carry American astronauts to the moon for the first time in more than 50 years aboard the 2027 Artemis 3 mission.

NASA is investing $4 billion into Starship's development, and canceling its contract could seriously handicap NASA and the future of U.S.-led space exploration.

While other competitors exist, such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin and Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, they lag far behind SpaceX.

—Trump's 2026 budget would slash NASA funding by 24% and its workforce by nearly one third

—NASA plans to build a giant radio telescope on the 'dark side' of the moon. Here's why.

The Starliner capsule is not yet certified to fly operational astronaut missions and was responsible for "stranding" two astronauts on the ISS for nine months last year. The astronauts returned to Earth on March 18 aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule, and neither Boeing nor NASA have offered any significant updates into fixes that will make Starliner flightworthy.

SpaceX's lead on its competitors is reflected in the size of its government subsidies. In April, the U.S. Space Force, the military branch of U.S. space exploration, awarded the company nearly $6 billion in launch contracts, while the United Launch Alliance received $5.4 billion and Blue Origin $2.4 billion.

In response to the feud between Musk and Trump, NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens declined to comment on SpaceX, but she did tell Reuters that "we will continue to work with our industry partners to ensure the president's objectives in space are met."

NASA's deputy administrator Lori Garver told Reuters that, as well as not being in national interests, canceling SpaceX's contacts would probably not be legal. However, she also added that "a rogue CEO threatening to decommission spacecraft, putting astronauts' lives at risk, is untenable."

In Supernatural's fifteen seasons on the air, the horror fantasy delved into obscure monster lore, urban legends, religions, and more. Sam and Dean Winchester traversed the country several times, hunting for everything that went bump in the night. Through the drama, the scares, and the sibling angst, Supernatural never shied away from poking fun at itself.

The series perfected the meta episode, with its crowning achievement being "The French Mistake." In addition to being the most meta episode of the series, it's also one of the funniest and Jared Padalecki's favorite. The iconic episode features a hilarious real-life joke in the form of tweets by Misha Collins.

"The French Mistake" opens with Balthazar showing up to give Sam and Dean a key before sending them to an alternate reality. Sam and Dean crash through the window in Bobby's house and end up on a film set, where they're the two lead actors on a TV show called Supernatural. The meta episode playfully takes shots at the cast and crew alike, featuring characters based on director Robert Singer, creator Eric Kripke, and showrunner at the time, Sera Gamble.

"The French Mistake"

February 25, 2011

9.6/10

Sam and Dean are thrust into the lives of their alter egos, Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, who apparently don't get along. As the boys delve deeper into the lives of their respective actors, they learn that Jared has an alpaca and a giant portrait of himself riding a horse, and that Jensen has an aquarium in his trailer and used to be in a soap opera. Then they discover J-Squared's wallets. Sam and Dean run up the actor's credit cards, buying the ingredients they needed for a spell.

Supernatural was never meant to go beyond five seasons, and fans still question whether the show should have ended earlier than season 15.  

The episode was hilarious, drawing comparisons to the gritty and dangerous world from which the brothers came with the frivolous and oftentimes absurd alternate reality. Whether it's watching Sam and Dean try to act, or seeing the crew discuss Sam and Dean attempting to kill an extra, to Eric Kripke walking straight into gunfire, and getting shot multiple times before going down, "The French Mistake" is easily one of the best and funniest episodes of Supernatural. It's no wonder it's not just Jared Padalecki's favorite episode, but also Misha Collins and Eric Kripke's.

Part of the masterpiece that is "The French Mistake" is the fictionalized Misha Collins. He's a bit of a dope and a bit of a jerk. Sam and Dean first run into their co-star Misha, mistaking him for Cas. They ask about the key from Balthazar and "Castiel" responds accordingly, but when Sam and Dean ask about the "TV crap," Misha breaks character. Sam and Dean angrily take the key back and storm off, taking digs at the names Misha and Jensen. As they walk away, Misha calls after them, thinking it is all a joke. He then tweets about the encounter, and Misha Collins amped up the meta-ness of the episode by actually tweeting Fake-Misha's post the night the episode aired.

Like the Winchesters, Castiel has also died a few times in Supernatural, only to be brought back every time for some higher purpose. 

When Sam and Dean have a rough go at acting, Misha starts to get frustrated with how many takes they need to film the scene. Collins revealed at a convention that wanted to "douche the character up as much as possible." He pushes one crew member away and ignores another. During a break in filming, Misha sends another fantastic tweet that Misha Collins posted a few hours after the first. Fake-Misha had one other tweet to send that read, "Ever get that feeling... Someone's in the backseat? Frowny face." Unfortunately, the angel that followed Sam and Dean was, in fact, in the backseat.

Virgil popped up and held a knife to Misha's throat before he could press send. After that, Virgil kills Misha to make a transdimensional call to Raphael. This final tweet never got posted in real life either, but he did keep the meta, reality-hopping story going with a final tweet.

This is the moment ghost hunters visiting caves in the Peak District captured ‘crying child ghosts' and ‘screams for help' on camera.

Ghost hunter Tony Ferguson, accompanied by fellow paranormal-enthusiasts Jon Brown and his friend, Simon, captured the chilling footage during a visit to the haunted Hidden Druids Caves. Stunned by what they filmed, the trio caught ghosts warning them to ‘get out.'

“We arrived at 9pm and by the time we had started we were already hearing things," said Tony. "At first, we heard a pair of boots clunking behind us, before children's laughter and a woman telling us to get out.”

Tony captured the chilling moment the ghosts tried to communicate with his friend, John, during his lone vigil at the caves in Birchover, Matlock. According to Tony, ‘voices' can be heard again, telling John to ‘f*** off'.

Tony said: “It was too strange to be a coincidence. We were filming until about half 10 at night, and the cliffs are impossible to get to without climbing rocks. Why would a lone woman or man be there?”

Tony, 40, explained that he always had an affinity for the paranormal. He said: “It started when I was a small boy at my Grandad's house - I would always see a male figure in a suit. Being young my parents thought I didn't like visiting, but as I got older, they started talking about the house and how it was haunted. After that, I was hooked.”

Tony officially started Ghosthunting in 2016, supported by friends like John (Exploring the Afterlife) and Simon (GS Searching for Ghosts). Tony said: “I am quite sceptical but quite shocked by what I experienced. After I got home, I googled the history of the caves as I do not like to be influenced and sure enough - the place was known for ritualistic sacrifice."

Tony concluded that the video was one of his most compelling yet. He said: “All three of us were silent on the way home. In cases like these I know your mind can play tricks on you, but there was something incredibly heavy about that spot.”
