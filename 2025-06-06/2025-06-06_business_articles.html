Chris Van Hollen meets with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, left, at an undisclosed location in San Salvador, El Salvador, in this handout provided by Sen. Chris Van Hollen's Office, on April 17.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man wrongly deported by the Trump administration to a prison in El Salvador, is being brought back to the US to face federal charges that he illegally transported undocumented immigrants within the country.

Abrego Garcia was indicted by a grand jury in Tennessee in May, according to court filings released Friday. In the indictment, the government alleges he was a member of the notorious MS-13 criminal gang.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange and custodian founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has confidentially filed for an IPO in the U.S., according to a press release on Friday. The number of shares and the pricing terms have not yet been decided upon, and the company said a listing "is expected to occur after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market and other conditions." By filing confidentially, Gemini can test investor appetite and prepare for a public debut without immediate scrutiny of its financials. The announcement comes after the SEC wrapped up its investigation into Gemini in February without recommending enforcement action, and follows a $5 million settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in January. Gemini is the latest crypto firm to pursue a public listing as President Donald Trump's administration pushes more favorable regulations for the industry, which heavily funded his campaign. Stablecoin issuer Circle held a blockbuster debut this week, with its stock soaring in its first two days on the market. Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital moved its listing from Toronto to the Nasdaq last month. Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange and custodian, was founded by the Winklevoss twins in 2014. In March, the company named former Affirm executive Dan Chen as its CFO in preparation for a public offering. "I'm looking forward to helping Gemini scale by driving financial strategy as the company enters its next phase of growth," Chen wrote in a post on LinkedIn at the time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon's retail business is locking down its hiring budget. According to an internal email, this major part of the company will keep a "flat headcount opex," or operating expenses, this year compared to 2024. Headcount operating expense refers to employee salaries plus their stock-based compensation, the email noted. The update was shared earlier this year by a finance leader in Amazon's retail unit. This executive explained that any increase in the hiring budget will be "scrutinized" and require "strong supporting reasons." That likely means managers now have a strict predefined budget allocated to their teams, instead of specific headcount targets when hiring. These changes only apply to corporate employees in Amazon's retail business. The retail organization includes everything from Amazon's online marketplace to its logistics arm and Fresh grocery business. In an email to BI, Amazon spokesperson Zoe Hoffman said this is the "responsible way" to grow a company of its size, and stressed that not growing the hiring budget in a given year is not the same as not hiring. Amazon continues to hire across the company, she added. "Each of Amazon's many businesses has its own approach to hiring based on its individual needs," Hoffman added in a statement. The move underscores CEO Andy Jassy's relentless push for increased efficiency and higher profit margins. Since taking over in 2021, he's slashed jobs, revamped pay, trimmed management layers, and even reconsidered Amazon's product listing approach, all in the name of saving money and driving efficiency. Amazon reported record profit of $59 billion in 2024, nearly double its 2023 result. Holding the hiring budget steady could encourage Amazon retail managers to get smarter and more flexible with compensation expenses. HR professionals say budget-based planning offers tighter financial control than headcount targets. Managing headcount instead of a hiring budget lets managers bring on high-cost talent without worrying much about salary, David Kryscynski, a human resources professor at Rutgers, told BI. But with a fixed labor budget, he said, managers are more likely to stay within financial limits, either by hiring less or opting for lower-cost candidates. This model also gives managers more staffing flexibility, said Shaun Pichler, a management professor at California State University, Fullerton. Without headcount targets, they can bring on cheaper contractors or temporary workers. And they're not pressured to spend the full budget, often resulting in leaner teams. "Tech firms have more widely adopted OpEx targets post-pandemic for largely the same reasons — high labor costs, reduced revenues, and to give managers more flexibility," Pichler said. Amazon's retail arm remains laser-focused on cutting costs. At an internal all-hands meeting earlier this year, retail chief Doug Herrington told employees that belt-tightening would likely extend into 2025, even as the company pours money into major investments elsewhere, BI previously reported. "We have to keep reducing costs so that we can afford the big investments in big new businesses," Herrington said. Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China has granted temporary export licenses to rare-earth suppliers of the top three U.S. automakers, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, as supply chain disruptions begin to surface from Beijing's export curbs on those materials. It was not immediately clear what quantity or items are covered by the approval or whether the move signals China is preparing to ease the rare-earths licensing process, which industry groups say is cumbersome and has created a supply bottleneck. China's decision in April to restrict exports of a wide range of rare earths and related magnets has tripped up the supply chains central to automakers, aerospace manufacturers, semiconductor companies and military contractors around the world. China's dominance of the critical mineral industry, key to the green energy transition, is increasingly viewed as a key point of leverage for Beijing in its trade war with U.S. President Donald Trump. China produces around 90% of the world's rare earths, and auto industry representatives have warned of increasing threats to production due to their dependency on it for those parts. Suppliers of three big U.S. automakers, General Motors, Ford and Jeep-maker Stellantis got clearance for some rare earth export licenses on Monday, one of the two sources said. GM and Ford each declined to comment. Stellantis said it is working with suppliers "to ensure an efficient licensing process" and that so far the company has been able to "address immediate production concerns without major disruptions." China's Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. China's critical-mineral export controls have become a focus on Trump's criticism of Beijing, which he says has violated the truce reached last month to roll back tariffs and trade restrictions. On Thursday, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping had a lengthy phone call to iron out trade differences. Trump said in social-media post that "there should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products." Both sides said teams will meet again soon. Ford shut down production of its Explorer SUV at its Chicago plant for a week in May because of a rare-earth shortage, the company said. The approval for the auto suppliers follows a green light granted to a U.S. electronics firm's suppliers last week and another one issued earlier this week to suppliers of a U.S. non-auto company, the first person said, declining to name the companies. Reuters reported on Wednesday that China has introduced a tracking system for its rare earth magnet sector in a move to improve its control over the sector and crackdown on smuggling.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This was CNBC's live blog covering European financial markets. European stock markets rose after digesting news of the ECB rate cut and the upward revision of first-quarter eurozone GDP this week. Why are UBS shares rallying after the Swiss government proposed tough new capital rules? JPMorgan analysts might also have the answer to that question. "Today's outcome is positive for UBS, based on our initial view, although we need to go through the full set of documents, due to the long timeframe for implementation in our view," said JPMorgan's analyst Kian Abouhossein in a note to clients. Shares of the bank jumped as much as 6% after Switzerland announced highly-anticipated capital regulations calling on UBS to hold an additional $26 billion in Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. The Wall Street bank's analysts said that UBS is expected to generate around $12 billion [per annum] in profits with a dividend of about $3 billion, which means the bank can "fulfill its 'capital gap' by 2033+ and still continue with buybacks." Why are UBS shares rallying after the Swiss government proposed tough new capital rules? Shares of the bank jumped as much as 6% after Switzerland announced highly-anticipated capital regulations calling on UBS to hold an additional $26 billion in Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. Johann Scholtz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, says the proposals are "as bad as it will get for UBS" — but that could give the bank some breathing room to lobby for concessions. "As we expected, there will be a long phase-out for UBS to deploy this, with the earliest that it will apply in full being 2034," says Johann Scholtz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. That means UBS "can now lobby for some concessions and take some actions themselves to mitigate impact, for instance upstream some excess capital from its subsidiaries," according to the analyst. Shares of UBS rose 5.4% after the Swiss government proposed strict new capital regulations which would require the banking giant to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital, following its 2023 takeover of stricken rival Credit Suisse. On Thursday, the U.S. Treasury Department added nine economies to a "monitoring list" of trading partners "whose currency practices and macroeconomic policies merit close attention." "It does not seek to prevent adjustments in the balance of trade or to gain unfair competitive advantages for the Swiss economy." A spokesperson for the SNB noted that it may need to intervene in foreign exchange markets if deemed necessary for the Swiss economy, which recently fell into disinflation as a soaring Swiss franc lowered the cost of imports. Stéphane Boujnah, CEO of Euronext, visited the CNBC studio in London this morning to chat to the "Squawk Box Europe" anchors about regional markets. He said interest in Europe had already started to pick up "before the Trump moment," but tariffs-induced volatility worsened the trend. "Many people decided that if you want to have your money in a predictable environment, in a rule of law environment, in an environment where the basic assumption of capitalism operates, then Europe is not a bad place," Boujnah said. Euronext operates exchanges in several European markets, including Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Milan. The Bank of Russia has announced it will cut interest rates to 20% from 21%, the first reduction since September 2022. "While domestic demand growth is still outstripping the capabilities to expand the supply of goods and services, the Russian economy is gradually returning to a balanced growth path," the central bank said Friday, adding that monetary policy would remain tight "for a long period" in order to return inflation to its 4% target. Tesla shares were 4.5% higher in premarket trade at 4:31 a.m. ET, after a war of words between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump helped wipe $152 billion off its value on Thursday, the biggest-ever hit to its market cap. The European Stoxx Automobiles and Parts index is 0.5% lower in early trade, after electric vehicle behemoth Tesla saw $152 billion wiped from its market cap in the wake of CEO Elon Musk's public spat with U.S. President Donald Trump. The sector has already seen volatile trade this week, as investors reacted to Trump doubling tariffs on steel to 50%. Europe's Stoxx 600 index is fractionally higher at 8:17 a.m. London time, up around 0.02%, coming off the back of three positive sessions. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 is leading the way with a 0.15% rise as oil and gas stocks advance amid higher crude prices, though Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 are down 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. In case you missed it, the spat between U.S. President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, the world's richest person, entered new territory overnight. What began with Musk publicly slamming Trump's spending bill has evolved into a full-on row between the two, with the president threatening to withdraw billions of dollars' worth of government contracts for Musk's companies. Musk, meanwhile, claimed Trump would never have won a second term in office without his input in the campaign, and said SpaceX would immediately decommission its Dragon spacecraft due to Trump's threats to cut funding. In the fallout, Tesla saw $152 billion wiped off of its market cap — the biggest hit to its valuation ever. FTSE 100 futures are currently 0.1% lower, while futures tied to the French CAC 40 and Germany's DAX are down by 0.4% and 0.1%, respectively. Regional stocks ended Thursday's session higher after the European Central Bank trimmed interest rates in a widely anticipated move. U.S. nonfarm payrolls data is due to be published later on Friday, with economists expecting a contraction in jobs from the previous month. Trade tensions are also still in focus for global investors after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Thursday. Trump said the 90-minute call was "very good" and "almost entirely" focused on trade. Overnight in Asia, stocks have been trading in mixed territory as investors digest the news that Trump and Xi held what the U.S. President described as a "very good" call. On Wall Street, U.S. stock futures are trading higher ahead of May's nonfarm payrolls data. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to lift a court order to reinstate U.S. Department of Education employees the administration had terminated as part of its efforts to dismantle the agency. More than 1,300 employees were affected by the mass layoffs in March. A federal appeals court had refused on Wednesday to lift the judge's ruling. In his May 22 preliminary injunction, Joun pointed out that the staff cuts led to the closure of seven out of 12 offices tasked with the enforcement of civil rights, including protecting students from discrimination on the basis of race and disability. (Around 17 million families apply for college aid each year using the form, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.) The Education Department cannot be abolished without approval by Congress. The Trump administration announced its reduction in force on March 11 that would have gutted the agency's staff. Two days later, 21 states — including Michigan, Nevada and New York — filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for its staff cuts. After President Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 20 aimed at dismantling the Education Department, more parties sued to save the department, including the American Federation of Teachers. Former President Jimmy Carter established the current-day U.S. Department of Education in 1979. Since then, the agency has faced other existential threats, with former President Ronald Reagan calling for its end and Trump, during his first term, attempting to merge it with the Labor Department.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just under three months ago, President Donald Trump stood next to Elon Musk outside the White House to choose a new Tesla. A senior White House official confirmed to Business Insider that Trump was considering selling or giving away the red Model S, which has a list price of about $80,000. Trump picked out the Model S from a lineup of Tesla vehicles during a sales pitch-like event with Musk at the White House in March. At the time, it was a show of support from Trump to his biggest financial backer, with Tesla stock plunging and the company becoming a target for protests due to Musk's efforts to slash the government workforce at DOGE. At the event, Trump said he was buying a Tesla because "it's a great product, as good as it gets," and because Musk had "devoted his energy and his life to doing this, and I think he's been treated very unfairly by a very small group of people." A high-profile spat began on Thursday with Musk criticising Trump's "big, beautiful" tax bill in a series of posts on X. Trump then called the billionaire "crazy" and suggested that "the easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts." If Trump does decide to sell his Model S, he should probably get a move on. A study by used car site iSeeCars in April found that used Model S prices had dropped more than any other model over the past year, as the resale value of used Teslas continues to slide. Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.</p>

Apple:

Company set to highlight software redesigns as it remains on sidelines of AI revolution.

Apple's previous WWDC event last June.

Apple Inc.'s upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference will do little to assuage fears that the iPhone maker is a laggard in AI. Instead, the event will focus on design and productivity enhancements for its long-established operating system franchises.

The company's keynote address, which begins at 10 a.m. Pacific time on Monday, will introduce redesigned software interfaces for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV and Apple Watch, in addition to more minor tweaks to the Vision Pro headset.</p>

Donald Trump speaks during a news conference with Elon Musk in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on May 30.

The White House is signaling that President Donald Trump intends to move on from his acrimonious fallout with billionaire Elon Musk, focusing on securing passage of his signature tax and spending bill and other economic policies.

After Thursday's blow-up, in which Trump and Musk traded threats of cutting government contracts and ending spaceflight programs, the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer indicated a willingness to defuse tensions, suggesting an eagerness for an off-ramp for a clash that risks costing his companies deeply.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Adam Foroughi tends to eschew the typical trappings of a billionaire. He has one car, and would rather it were self-driving. He rarely appears on TV or conference stages. In his downtime, you're more likely to find him at home with his five children than schmoozing on the slopes of Davos. People who know him point to his mild manner and lack of ego. His advertising technology company, AppLovin, is similarly unflashy. With an ad network that reaches around a billion daily users and a market cap more than twice that of Snap, Pinterest, and Reddit combined, it was the technology behemoth you'd never heard of. "We're a $100 billion-plus company, not many people know of us, so that's probably a flaw on me," Foroughi told Business Insider in an interview. Ahead of a June 19 deadline, AppLovin and Foroughi, 45, made a last-minute bid to acquire the international assets of TikTok as the Chinese-owned company faces a potential ban in the US. It's an audacious move for any company, let alone one with a founder who usually goes out of his way to avoid the spotlight. President Donald Trump has said he's been negotiating with multiple potential buyers. Investors like Kevin O'Leary of "Shark Tank" fame and former Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have signaled interest, and other tech companies are in the mix. Foroughi executes with a hands-on management style that has, at times, seen him struggle to delegate to execs who don't fit the mold. And the company's recent financial success has also caught the attention of short sellers who have raised questions about its data practices. With TikTok, Foroughi would be taking on an organization with a much bigger spotlight — and the heat that comes from running a user-generated content business popular among teens and often lambasted by parents. Most of the former AppLovin employees, competitors, and business associates who spoke with BI believe he's up to the task. "We've been competing for over a decade, and I've never seen anyone like him — he's all around amazing, it hurts me to say it," said an executive at one of AppLovin's competitors. "He's the most talented CEO I have ever seen." Foroughi acknowledged that the TikTok bid is uncharted territory for him, but "I don't really care about 'uncomfortable,'" he said. His father, once one of Iran's leading real estate developers, left nearly all his wealth behind, and the family had to adjust to a more frugal lifestyle, a new culture, and a different language. Eventually, as the app stores of Apple and Google became dominant, he looked to apps. In 2012, they launched their third attempt — an app that allowed friends to connect and send recommendations for other apps to download. If you were playing "Words with Friends," the app could send a push notification to your contacts, asking them to join. Like many tech companies, AppLovin — which Foroughi insists wasn't inspired by McLovin, the nerdy character in the stoner film "Superbad" — decided to pivot to advertising. The business model is fairly simple: It helps app developers make money and find users using in-app ads. While TikTok has soared in popularity, particularly among Gen Z, its ad revenue lags behind Google, Meta, and Amazon. AppLovin thinks its adtech can help close the gap. After it opened up its ad platform to e-commerce advertisers, some said that they were excited for an alternative to Meta, which had become increasingly expensive in their hunt for new customers. Mike True, CEO of the e-commerce marketing platform Prescient AI, said AppLovin is the fourth most invested-in channel among its advertiser clients, behind Meta, Google, and Amazon Ads. "The fact that advertisers continue to invest in AppLovin, even amid a cautious market, suggests growing confidence in its long-term role within the performance stack," True said. Last year, the company posted net income of $1.58 billion at 34% margins — a margin profile almost on a par with Meta, and ahead of its closest adtech rival, The Trade Desk, which had a profit margin of 16% in 2024. But some observers said that while AppLovin helped e-commerce advertisers extract more sales from current customers, it was less effective in driving sales from new ones. Jones Road Beauty was one of AppLovin's early e-commerce clients, but its CEO, Cody Plofker, told BI it's no longer using AppLovin. "We found it not to be very incremental with new customers," Plofker said. Foroughi said that the e-commerce product is still in its infancy and doesn't yet work for everyone. One Silicon Valley tech veteran who interacted with AppLovin in the early years said taking meetings with Foroughi was a "breath of fresh air." He cut to the chase, no two-martini lunches necessary. Spaull stayed at the company for almost seven years, as it continuously posted record annual revenue, mostly growing traction through word of mouth in the gaming community. Foroughi has remained deeply enmeshed with day-to-day operations, including customer service. Up until around a year ago, he ran product and human resources alongside his CEO role. (He said he wanted to "get more involved in making sure our culture is aligned with the principles we had when we started the business.") "You don't know what's going on in your business if you don't work with your employees," Foroughi said. Foroughi has said some of the biggest mistakes he made as CEO involved taking outside advice, including briefly hiring a chief operating officer in 2012. "I thought, what's the point of me at this company, I'm hands-on, I'm not going to defer to this hire," Foroughi said at a recent conference held by the investment bank Jefferies. He had a similar reaction after following advice to bring on a chief revenue officer and a brand ad sales team, with staffers who were paid more than the company's best engineer, the person making the actual product. "It bugged the crap out of me," Foroughi said. The company's strategy has been defined in part by unrelenting efficiency. Foroughi, who said he considers Elon Musk as an inspiration, counts EBITDA — or profit — per employee as one of his most important success metrics. The company recently sold off its entire mobile gaming studio business — developers of hit games like "Mobile Strike" and "Project Makeover" — deeming it surplus after the apps had been sucked for data to use for its advertising algorithms. Foroughi also showed a cut-throat streak in 2022, when the gaming software development company Unity announced its intention to acquire AppLovin's app advertising rival, IronSource. Unity's management team wasn't happy, and they rejected the hostile takeover bid. Those within Foroughi's orbit say the billionaire has a generous side. A banker who worked on AppLovin's 2021 initial public offering recalled receiving an updated draft of the registration statement and noticing that Foroughi had recently sold off around $10 million of stock, at a low price, pre-IPO. The TikTok suitor is no stranger to US-China tensions. "CFIUS saved my ass," Foroughi said at the Jefferies Private Growth Conference earlier this year, referring to AppLovin's financial performance since. The company's methods have been called into question in recent months with four short-seller reports, published in quick succession. The most high-profile, from Carson Block's Muddy Waters Research, said AppLovin was "impermissibly extracting" data from top apps like Meta, Google, and TikTok, and targeting ads at "high value users" without their consent. The report also said AppLovin was using underhanded techniques to claim credit for sales it didn't generate. In an email to BI, Block said that Muddy Waters believed Foroughi "lied" in a March blog post, when he pushed back on the idea that the company "uses persistent user identifiers without their consent." Persistent identifiers follow users across different websites and devices, and it can be difficult for users to delete them or even know they exist. Muddy Waters said AppLovin's use of these IDs violates various platforms' terms of service and privacy laws in some jurisdictions. He was referring to Foroughi's tenure at a company called Claria, which owned a controversial eWallet software called Gator, that was said at the time to have distributed "adware" that collected users' browsing habits, and bombarded them with pop-up ads. One of Foroughi's early ad networks, SocialHour, was removed from Facebook in 2009 for violating its platform policies. Foroughi has previously said in blog posts that the short-seller reports were "littered with inaccuracies and false assertions" and were aimed at driving down AppLovin's share price for their own financial gain. In response to questions about SocialHour, he said all companies that monetized Facebook's inventory were removed when Facebook brought monetization in-house. Some industry insiders saw the reports as confirmation of their bafflement at AppLovin's success, particularly in light of its reliance on mobile games, which are not always highly valued by big brands and agencies. Foroughi describes this as an "enhancement" to Oracle, which is TikTok's cloud provider in the US. Under AppLovin's proposal, Oracle would still provide data storage and security. Oracle didn't respond to requests for comment. AppLovin has also pitched itself as a salve for TikTok's woes. "There are really big national security and data issues, and I think we could solve them," Foroughi told BI. "I see what folks in the administration are doing now, what someone like Elon has sacrificed to give back to the country, and I think we could play a small part here," Foroughi said in an interview that took place before Musk and Trump's spectacular falling out this week. TikTok didn't respond to a request for comment. Ari Paparo, a former Googler and adtech exec who now runs the marketing media company Marketecture, said AppLovin has some big advantages in its TikTok bid: Its monster market capitalization makes the financial side feasible, it has proven monetization capabilities that could make ads on TikTok better, and it isn't "Big Tech," which has drawn antitrust scrutiny. In April, Foroughi was spotted at the launch party of Donald Trump Jr.'s private members club. "​​I'm reclusive by design, so part of the challenge has been that I have to get out there, and get to be known, and I just wasn't before this," Foroughi said.

Shortly after Trump was wounded in an assassination attempt at a rally in July, Musk took to X to declare his endorsement of Trump's presidential bid. He later stood by Trump's side at Mar-a-Lago on election night, celebrating his victory. In November, Trump said Musk would help lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, which was tasked with cutting federal spending. Early in Trump's second term, Musk was a regular fixture at the White House. But in May, Musk began distancing himself from the administration. Then on Thursday, it all came crashing down: Musk and Trump had a very public falling out, trading barbs on their respective social media platforms. Musk, who left his role at DOGE last week, took to X to criticize Trump's tax bill in a flurry of posts, branding it the "Big Ugly Spending Bill." Trump then fired back during a White House event, expressing his disappointment in Musk and dismissing the criticism as a case of "Trump Derangement Syndrome," before turning to Truth Social to defend his tax bill. Representatives for Ackman and Ye did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider outside regular hours.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk's feud with President Donald Trump has officially reached orbit. Musk said in a post on X Thursday that SpaceX "will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately" in light of Trump's statement that floated canceling the billionaire's government contracts and subsidies. The SpaceX CEO included a screenshot of Trump's earlier Truth Social post, which said terminating Musk's government contracts would be the "easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars." Musk walked that decision back around five hours later. Cool off and take a step back for a couple days," X user Fab25june wrote on the platform. Ok, we won't decommission Dragon," Musk said. SpaceX's Dragon spaceships are used to transport NASA astronauts and supplies to and from the International Space Station. In a statement to Business Insider, Bethany Stevens, NASA press secretary, said: "NASA will continue to execute upon the President's vision for the future of space. We will continue to work with our industry partners to ensure the President's objectives in space are met." The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The comments came as the feud between the former allies exploded on Thursday, with Trump and Musk publicly trading insults on their respective social media platforms, Truth Social and X. The agency, which retired its space shuttle program in 2011, depended on Russian Soyuz spacecraft for crewed missions prior to partnering with SpaceX. Steve Bannon, who served as the White House chief strategist in Trump's first term, said in an interview Thursday that Trump should act immediately in response to Musk's announcement about decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft. "President Trump tonight should sign an executive order calling for the Defense Production Act," Bannon said, referring to a federal law that grants the president authority to influence or control domestic industry in the name of national defense,"and seize SpaceX tonight before midnight."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Twenty-five minutes of live TV, more than a dozen posts on X, and three posts on Truth Social over the period of five hours (and counting) — that's how the already fractured friendship of Elon Musk and President Donald Trump publicly unraveled on Thursday. The first signs of trouble began when Musk showed opposition to Trump's spending bill, the "One Big Beautiful Bill," though he never explicitly targeted Trump. "Shame on those who voted for it," Musk tweeted on Tuesday, referring to Congress members who voted for Trump's tax cut bill. Trump, for his part, had stayed uncharacteristically mum about Musk's criticism of the bill. But that all changed on Thursday morning. Musk began digging up Trump's old posts on what was then Twitter about the deficit, including one from January of 2013. Musk unearthed another old X post by Trump from back in July 2012, presumably as a swipe at the new Republican tax bill that many economists and the congressional Budget Office said would increase the country's deficits. Trump responded to Musk's attacks for the first time when answering press questions during a White House event to welcome German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. "And you know Elon's upset because we took the EV mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles," said Trump. "And they're having a hard time, the electric vehicles. And they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy. Trump's comments about Musk continued at the press appearance. "He said the most beautiful things about me. He hasn't said bad things about me personally, but I'm sure that'll be next. "I don't know what it is. The whole world is different, and they become hostile," he added. Musk began a whirlwind of tweets soon after, responding in near real time to what Trump said during the press appearance. "False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!" False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it! Musk then began a series of tweets directed at the president beyond the bill, including saying that without him, Republicans would have lost. Musk polls his X followers about creating a new political party "that actually represents the 80% in the middle." Mark Cuban quoted the post with three checkmarks. Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle? Not even those in Congress who had to vote on the Big Ugly Spending Bill had time to read it! "Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do! "The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!" Musk responds to Trump's posts on Truth Social, calling them "such an obvious lie." That is the real reason they have not been made public.Have a nice day, DJT! Trump posts on Truth Social again to defend his tax bill. "I don't mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress," Trump wrote. If this Bill doesn't pass, there will be a 68% Tax Increase, and things far worse than that. Musk says SpaceX will decommission its Dragon spacecraft "immediately." Prior to partnering with SpaceX, the agency depended on Russian Soyuz spacecraft for crewed missions. In light of the President's statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately pic.twitter.com/NG9sijjkgW Musk says that Trump's tariffs will "cause a recession in the second half of this year." Some economists have also predicted that Trump's tariffs would hurt the economy, and Trump himself declined to rule out the chances of a recession back in March. Musk retweeted what appears to be a video of Trump partying with Epstein from the 1990s, doubling down on his earlier statement about the Epstein files. "This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Business Insider in a statement. "The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again." Musk took a softer tone later on Thursday night. Some five hours after his post about decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft, he walked back the decision in a response to an X user. Ok, we won't decommission Dragon," Musk wrote at 9:20 p.m. In a separate exchange on X, billionaire investor Bill Ackman encouraged Musk and Trump to make up. We are much stronger together than apart," Ackman wrote.</p>
