                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration could have sent eight migrants with deportation orders and the immigration agents who were escorting them to a facility in the U.S. after a federal judge recently barred officials from deporting them to war-torn South Sudan, where they could face persecution or torture. Naval Base Camp Lemonnier in the East African country of Djibouti, where a court filing on Thursday said they face illness, the threat of rocket fire from nearby Yemen, temperatures that soar past 100°F daily, and rancid smoke from nearby burn pits where human waste and trash are incinerated. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, blamed U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy for “stranding” the 13 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and eight detainees at the naval base, where they have been housed since late May in a metal shipping container converted into a conference room with just six bunk beds. The administration has frequently attacked judges for issuing rulings that have interfered with President Donald Trump's ability to carry out his anti-immigration agenda. In a court transcript, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign told Murphy that “bringing them back would be a much broader remedy than necessary” and suggested the detainees could have a “reasonable fear interview where they are” in Djibouti to determine if they had a credible fear of persecution or torture if they were deported. Murphy had instructed officials to arrange reasonable fear interviews when he ruled in May that they could not be sent to South Sudan. “The judge did NOT require that anyone be ‘stranded' anywhere,” said Reichlin-Melnick. Murphy's ruling in May interrupted a deportation flight carrying the migrants — who have been convicted of crimes and are from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan, and Vietnam — to South Sudan. That ruling was underpinned by the Convention Against Torture, which bars governments from deporting people to countries where they could be face torture. This is a situation the government both created and can remedy if it so chooses.” The filing explained that they are unable to get tested to determine what the illness is, and there is only a small supply of inhalers, Tylenol, eye drops, and nasal spray to treat the symptoms. Based on what was described, Politico's Kyle Cheney asked: “Why is the Trump administration forcing them to stay there?” ICE describes absolutely hellish conditions for both its officers and immigrant detainees at a U.S. naval base in Djibouti — risk of malaria, extreme heat, limited lighting, sparse security measures, nearby burn pits, potential for rocket attacks, rampant sickness.It raises the… pic.twitter.com/VsIIJjjF3B “ICE's claims of difficulties here are ENTIRELY self-inflicted,” said Reichlin-Melnick. I have sympathy for the low-level officers stuck there, but it's ALL their bosses' fault.” The administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay Murphy's order requiring screenings for the migrants, claiming that ruling violated officials' authority to deport immigrants to third countries if their home countries won't take them back. Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director for Detention Watch Network, told Newsweek that the administration's insistence on detaining the migrants in a shipping container at Camp Lemonniere is “the latest move in Trump's shocking expansion of third country deportations.” The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As experts on public safety, we have seen firsthand the importance of childhood trauma in driving violence. At Newark's HUBB Arts and Trauma Center (HUBB ATC) we see every day the struggles of young people to overcome trauma in their daily lives and to take the difficult steps needed to break the cycle of violence. Both of us experienced untreated childhood traumas and understand the need for services tailored to young people's experiences. At 15, Alex Vitale was stabbed by a home intruder. For years, he suffered from anxiety and slept with a weapon next to his bed. As a child, Al-Tariq Best endured a range of traumatic experiences, including domestic violence, murder, drug exposure, and sexual abuse. After his mother made the difficult decision to leave and eventually divorce his father, they became entangled with another abusive man who inflicted relentless physical, emotional, and psychological abuse upon the family. Growing up in this chaos fostered a dangerous normalization of abuse, contributing to their own emotional insecurities and distorted perceptions of relationships. Research into violent crime has shown that past trauma plays a major role in predicting future violence, especially among young people. When people are exposed to or directly experience traumatic events such as suffering domestic violence, witnessing a shooting, or even regularly hearing about the violent deaths of friends and family members, it can lead to forms of post-traumatic stress, similar to that seen in combat veterans. Over 20 percent of children in the U.S. grow up in poverty, and youth violence is heavily concentrated within exactly this population. At the same time, they are less well equipped to manage this trauma because they are still developing emotionally and intellectually, making them more likely to engage in impulsive and poorly thought-out behavior. Over the last decade, new efforts have emerged to address trauma at the community level as part of an overall strategy to reduce community violence. Trauma recovery centers (TRCs) have been created across the U.S. that put clinical mental health workers in community-based settings to engage with people who have suffered trauma. The National Alliance of Trauma Recovery Centers reports that there are 59 such centers in 15 states that attempt to overcome the stigma too often associated with receiving mental health services. In New Jersey, Newark Community Street Team, a community-based violence reduction program created in 2014, opened its Trauma Recovery Center in 2020 and serves people who have experienced a broad range of traumas at no cost. The Grady TRC in Atlanta is based at a local hospital and helps people who have been the victims of violence get their lives back on track through medical services, psychological therapy, and essential social services that often harness victim services resources. Several states have attempted to support this work by authorizing TRCs to bill Medicaid for the delivery of these essential health services. Medicaid provides medical coverage for the poor and disabled through grants to states, which then decide how best to spend the money within federal guidelines. California, Oregon, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, and Illinois have all passed laws enabling TRCs to receive Medicaid reimbursements for their work. It has served young people in Newark at high risk of involvement in violence since 2013 by utilizing a mixture of arts programing, mentoring, social services, and mental health support to stabilize young people in crisis. The HUBB ATC is part of a citywide effort to build community capacity to stop violence outside the traditional use of police, courts, and prisons. Together, these groups have helped drive down violent crime in Newark to historic lows. Over the last few years, the organization has received grants and in-kind donations to build out a multifaceted youth trauma center that would allow for both situational and intensive long-term therapeutic interventions. New Jersey has been considering a bill to allow the use of Medicaid reimbursements, but that bill is likely to be moot given the massive cuts to Medicaid contained in the GOP budget bill. The proposed $800 billion reduction would make expansion in Medicaid coverage highly unlikely since states will be under huge pressure to make up for the forthcoming shortfalls. Hopefully the Senate will take steps to block the Medicaid cuts and New Jersey and other states can move forward with this essential service that will both improve the mental health of young people and help reduce violence. Otherwise, it will be up to local and state governments as well as philanthropy to try and make up the difference. The evidence is clear that youth violence is a public health issue that is best dealt with through community-centered behavioral health interventions and social services, not more intensive policing and mass incarceration.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taiwanese people who spend large amounts of time on TikTok are more likely to agree with some pro-China narratives, a survey has suggested. China's ruling Communist party (CCP) claims Taiwan is a province of China and has vowed to annex it under what it terms “reunification”, by force if necessary. Social media is a key battleground in China's information warfare, as it seeks to convince or coerce Taiwan into accepting annexation without military conflict. Differences were stark among supporters of Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive party (DPP), which the CCP has labelled illegal separatists. “Our analysis suggests that active TikTok use is more likely to influence users' political attitudes toward being more anti-democratic establishment and positive attitudes toward PRC governance, even among groups traditionally opposed to the CCP,” said the report's author, Eric Hsu. TikTok is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, and fears of it being used to spread pro-CCP propaganda have already resulted in restrictions or threats of outright bans in several countries, including the US. In Taiwan, there are rules against TikTok being used on government devices. In 2019, the Guardian revealed how ByteDance used TikTok to advance Beijing's foreign policy aims by moderating sensitive content. A 2023 study, by Rutgers University's Network Contagion Research Institute in the US, found TikTok's algorithms consistently amplify pro-CCP content and suppress anti-CCP narratives, with much of the pro-CCP content originating from state-linked entities. A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Titus C Chen, a research fellow at Taiwan's National Chengchi University, said the vast majority of TikTok users “aren't actively seeking out political content when they use the platform”. He said it could not be ruled out that users were just more inclined to agree with such views and so were being fed content that aligned with their interests. “That said, it's undeniably true that TikTok's content – both its Chinese and international versions – is heavily influenced and controlled by the Chinese government,” said Chen. “So it's very unlikely you'll come across much content on TikTok that supports liberal democracy.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alex Chiu fell 3,000ft from a climbing route on Denali, or Mount McKinley, and was not roped up at the time Mountaineering rangers in Alaska recovered the body of a Seattle man who died after falling 3,000ft from a climbing route on Denali, or Mount McKinley, the highest mountain in North America. The National Park Service said that Alex Chiu, 41, was on the treacherous mountain's west buttress route when he fell from a location called Squirrel Point, about 12,000ft above sea level. Chiu's body was transferred to the state medical examiner on Wednesday, the Denali national park and preserve said. Two other members of Chiu's team had reported on Monday that Chui had fallen and that they had lowered themselves over the edge as far as possible but were unable to see or hear Chiu. Ground and air search crews were unable to reach the site until early Wednesday because of very high winds and heavy snow. An unroped French mountaineer fell to his death near the same location in 2010. There are currently 500 climbers on the peak and more on other mountains and glacial approaches to peaks in the spectacular range that is breathtaking but fraught with risk. Denali is known to be deceptively dangerous, although it looks relatively benign to ordinary tourists viewing the summit on a clear day from Denali national park. Climbers wanting to summit Denali must scale 18,000 vertical feet compared with Everest's 12,000ft.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Prime Minister declined to answer a question Friday on whether he believed Mr. Modi was involved in the death of Mr. Nijjar, who was shot dead outside a Sikh gurdwara in Surrey, B.C. “There is a legal process that is literally under way and quite advanced in Canada, and it's never appropriate to make comments with respect to those legal processes,” he said. “My role as chair of the G7 it is important to invite the most important countries to attend to talk about important issues such as energy, artificial intelligence, critical minerals, and India is really at the very center of global supply chains,” Mr. Carney said. There's been no public indication that India has agreed to co-operate in Canada's investigation of the Nijjar slaying. Canada-India relations suffered a major rupture in September, 2023, when Mr. Trudeau told Parliament that Canada's national security apparatus has reason to believe “agents of the Indian government” killed Mr. Nijjar. Twenty months after this diplomatic breach, Canada's and India's ambassador-level posts in each other's country are still vacant. “As vibrant democracies bound by deep people-to-people ties, India and Canada will work together with renewed vigour, guided by mutual respect and shared interests,” he wrote. “For Sikhs in Canada, this is a betrayal, not just of our community, but of core Canadian values,” WSO President Danish Singh said in a statement. “We would never welcome leaders from Russia, China, or Iran under such circumstances. Yet India has done far more on Canadian soil in terms of foreign interference and transnational repression, including orchestrating murders, and is being rewarded with a red carpet welcome.” Canada-India relations will be repaired ‘one step at a time': Anita Anand Last week, Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand said Canada looks forward to rebuilding ties with India as part of an effort to diversify trade away from the United States – even as the RCMP investigation into Mr. Nijjar's murder continues. The Carney government, which also talked of repairing ties with China Thursday, is strengthening overseas relations as ties with the United States erode under U.S. President Donald Trump. Ms. Anand last week said the renewal of ties with India will take place “one step at a time.” “As I mentioned, the rule of law will never be compromised, and there is an ongoing investigation regarding the case that you mentioned,” she said in an interview, referring to Mr. Nijjar's murder. “On the global front, it's important that democracies work in concert at a challenging and uncertain time like this,” Mr. Hyder said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A long weekend, an old friend, her milestone birthday. But in this tumultuous spring of 2025, New York was not an option. We swapped out Broadway for an Ontario road trip to Prince Edward County; the only Big Apple these Canadians were going to get anywhere near was Colborne's roadside attraction along the 401. A version of this is being repeated across the country in this annus horribilis for Canadian-U.S. relations, with more tales of travel switch-outs emerging as the summer season begins. Canadians did not have a say in the U.S. election that has played havoc with the economy and brought threats to our sovereignty. Canadians go elbows up on U.S. travel, opting for these destinations instead And 75 per cent of Canadians who were planning a trip to the U.S. say the tariff announcements have influenced their travel plans. Travel to the U.S. was down in April, with a drop of more than 35 per cent in Canadian residents returning over land borders from the year before. For example, the Canadian firm representing Visit Detroit pitched a Mother's Day “stylish weekend” trip. Because the chances of Canada's national newspaper – which has taken on the grassroots Elbows Up campaign in a big way – suggesting you take mom over the border to celebrate her special day were approximately nil. Travellers change plans to avoid intense U.S. border checks as Canadian airlines rethink routes Publicists tell me, though, that while they are not getting much (or any) uptake on these pitches, their objectives include keeping their destinations on Canadian travellers' radars. This crisis has been a recurring theme this week in Saskatoon, at the Travel Media Association of Canada Conference, event chair Tania Kedikian tells me. Ms. Kedikian is senior account director at Development Counsellors International (“The Leader in Marketing Places”) and she oversees DCI's marketing strategy for all U.S. clients that are interested in the Canadian market. But, with her rose-coloured sunnies firmly on, she says she believes this is not a flat-out rejection of the U.S. For instance, she sees event-driven travel emerging strongly; trips to the U.S. tied to a specific event – the Boston Marathon, a Beyonce concert. “In those cases, opportunity is trumping all,” she wrote to me, employing an, er, interesting choice of words. Opinion: If Canadians have to ride the tariff rollercoaster, we can at least boycott U.S. travel And when FIFA's main event, the World Cup, comes to North America next year, how will all of this affect games played in the U.S.? There are more severe victims of the Donald Trump administration than Canadian publicists and PR firms, obviously. An even greater concern is for Canadian destinations that may experience a drop in U.S. tourism. A video released this week featuring local leaders in Northern Ontario's Lake Superior region suggests a slight air of desperation. “I'd like to send out a big smalltown welcome to our American friends,” says Kevin Mullins, mayor of the township of Schreiber. “I'd like you to know we're open for business.” Prince Edward County was lovely, if a little pricey. My friend and I got our celebratory weekend and we didn't have to deal with a hostile exchange rate or shakedown at the border. But here was the best part: I allowed myself, no prescribed myself, a break from anything involving He Who Is Ruining Everything.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>20,000 people chose to be part of the Kyiv Independent community —  thank you. Russia is prepared to offer political asylum to tech billionaire Elon Musk following his public feud with U.S. President Donald Trump, Dmitry Novikov, deputy chair of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, said June 6. "I think Musk is playing a completely different game, that he won't need political asylum, although if he did, Russia could certainly provide it," Novikov told the state-run news agency TASS. The remarks came days after Musk's 130-day stint as head of a temporary federal commission ended on May 30, and amid deepening tensions between the Tesla CEO and Trump. Trump responded by personally attacking Musk during his meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on June 5. In his Truth Social post, Trump said that Musk "just went crazy." Musk replied on social media that Trump owed his electoral victory to him, claiming that without his influence, Democrats would have maintained control of the House. Musk was a key figure in Trump's campaign and early administration. As head of the government efficiency task force, he led efforts to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which has provided over $37 billion in aid to Ukraine. Despite initially supporting Ukraine and providing Starlink satellite systems to bolster military communications, Musk has increasingly echoed Russian narratives. He has also lobbied against U.S. military assistance to Ukraine, arguing it only prolongs the war — a line frequently used by Kremlin officials to discourage Western backing for Kyiv. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A sweeping new travel ban on citizens from a dozen nations was announced by the White House on Wednesday, reviving a defining effort from the first Trump administration to crack down on entries from specific countries. Trump said in a video posted Wednesday that new countries could be added to the travel ban as “threats emerge around the world.” The 12 countries targeted – plus seven more, which face partial restrictions – are mostly nations with frosty, adversarial or outwardly antagonistic relations with Washington. Many are either failed states or in the throes of repressive rule, and some are governed by groups that took control after years of US involvement in their affairs. “Frankly, we want to keep bad people out of our country,” Trump said Thursday. Visa overstays have received renewed scrutiny since the Boulder, Colorado, attack last weekend against a group campaigning in solidarity with the Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Seven countries were included because the administration deemed they pose a “high level of risk” to the US: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. The travel ban does not target existing visa or green card holders, and it also features carve-outs for some visa categories and for people whose entry serves US interests. Its impact will vary greatly from country to country; some nations only receive a few hundred nonimmigrant visas per year, while others have seen hundreds of thousands of people enter the US in the past decade. Travel to the US has been fully restricted for citizens from Chad, Sudan, Libya, Eritrea, the Republic of Congo, Somalia and Equatorial Guinea. Meanwhile, a partial restriction has been imposed on nationals from Burundi, Togo and Sierra Leone. The US does not issue a high number of visas to most of those countries – according to State Department data, only a few hundred or a few thousand people from each were granted immigrant and nonimmigrant visas in 2023. The White House said Somalia had been identified as a “terrorist safe haven,” led by a government that lacks “command and control of its territory.” This year, the US carried out airstrikes in Somalia against ISIS and affiliated targets, in a joint counterterrorism effort with the nation. Relations with Sudan have soured; last month, the Trump administration said it would impose sanctions on the military-led Sudanese government after finding that it used chemical weapons last year during its ongoing war with a rival military faction. The US has been unable to broker a ceasefire to end the conflict that has raged on for two years, leaving tens of thousands dead. The White House has also had a frosty relationship with Chad, which demanded the removal of American troops from its territory last year, as well as with Eritrea, whose military the Biden administration accused in 2023 of committing war crimes during a conflict in northern Ethiopia. Similar reprimands have been made by the US State Department against state and non-state actors in Libya, which it accused of committing crimes against humanity. The White House said Wednesday that Chad's overstay rate is “unacceptable and indicates a blatant disregard for U.S. immigration laws.” The President of Chad, Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno, said on Facebook that he had told his government to “act in accordance with the principles of reciprocity” by suspending visas to citizens of the United States. “Chad has no planes to offer, no billions of dollars to give but Chad has his dignity and pride,” he added. The African Union Commission said in a Thursday statement it was “concerned” about the impact of bans “on people-to-people ties, educational exchange, commercial engagement, and the broader diplomatic relations that have been carefully nurtured over decades.” Haiti has been in the grips of violent unrest for years. The violence has left more than one million Haitians internally displaced. Two other Latin American nations – Cuba and Venezuela – also face restrictions, though Trump stopped short of implementing a full ban. Trump in March revoked temporary humanitarian parole for about 300,000 Cubans, amid a record number of arrivals of migrants from the Caribbean island. On Thursday, Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla said the ban “has racist undertones” and “damages personal, professional, academic, and cultural exchanges between the two countries.” Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yván Gil Pinto called the travel ban issued against Venezuelan nationals an “operation of hate and stigmatization,” in a statement released Thursday. For its reviled military leaders, it has brought opportunity Myanmar's ruling military junta has spent the past four years waging a brutal civil war across the Southeast Asian country, sending columns of troops on bloody rampages, torching and bombing villages, massacring residents, jailing opponents and forcing young men and women to join the army. The junta is headed by a widely reviled army chief who overthrew the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi and installed himself as leader, and the nation was thrown into further turmoil by a devastating earthquake in March. But relations have improved dramatically this century, and the US-Laos partnership is one of the most stable and productive of all 19 countries targeted by Wednesday's ban. Egypt has long been a key US partner in the Middle East. According to the US embassy in Egypt, some 450 Egyptians travel to the United States annually on professional and academic exchange programs. Since 1978, the US has contributed more than $50 billion in military assistance to Egypt, according to the American embassy, though some of this aid has been occasionally withheld on account of the country's human rights record.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A young Tibetan controversially appointed by China's atheist Communist Party as the second-highest spiritual leader in Tibetan Buddhism has pledged to make the religion more Chinese. The Beijing-appointed Panchen Lama is dismissed as an imposter by many Tibetans at home and in exile, but he is often quoted in China's state-run media toeing the Communist Party's line and praising its policies in Tibet. In a rare meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing on Friday, Gyaltsen Norbu vowed to make his own contributions to promoting ethnic unity and systematically advancing “the sinicization of religion,” state news agency Xinhua reported. The remarks refer to a sweeping campaign unleashed by Xi with an aim to purge religious faiths of foreign influence and align them more closely with traditional Chinese culture – and the authoritarian rule of the officially atheist Communist Party. Gyaltsen Norbu also vowed to keep Xi's teachings firmly in mind, resolutely support the party's leadership and firmly safeguard national unity and ethnic solidarity, according to Xinhua. He was told by Xi to carry forward the “patriotic and religious traditions” of Tibetan Buddhism and contribute to fostering “a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation,” Xinhua reported. But three days after he was chosen, according to the US government, Gedhun and his family were disappeared by the Communist Party, which then appointed an alternative Panchen Lama. In a statement marking that anniversary, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio denounced Chinese authorities for “abducting” him and his family. He called on Beijing to immediately release Gedhun Choekyi Nyima and “stop persecuting Tibetans for their religious beliefs.” In 2020, the Chinese government publicly acknowledged the fate of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima for the first time, describing him as “a college graduate with a job,” and that neither he nor his family wished to be disturbed in their “current normal lives.” Meanwhile, Gyaltsen Norbu has occupied an increasingly high-profile role since becoming an adult, joining a top Chinese political body, often appearing at important events in Beijing and meeting large crowds in the Tibetan regions of China. Related article Letter from Tibet: A breathtaking journey through the tightly guarded spiritual heartland For decades, the Dalai Lama has been a persistent thorn in Beijing's side as he commanded the loyalty of many Tibetan people from exile and kept their struggle for greater autonomy alive on the world stage. Beijing has insisted it will choose his successor – as well as the reincarnation of all Tibetan Buddhist lamas, but the Dalai Lama and his supporters have said that any successor named by China would not be respected.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>20,000 people chose to be part of the Kyiv Independent community —  thank you. Ukrainian forces struck multiple Russian airfields and military facilities overnight on June 6, hours before Russia launched one of its heaviest aerial assaults of the war, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported. Ukrainian strikes reportedly targeted Engels and Dyagilevo airfields — two key hubs for Russia's long-range bomber fleet, as well as logistics sites in Russia's Kursk Oblast. Engels-2 air base, located in Saratov Oblast, nearly 600 kilometers (370 miles) from Ukraine's front lines, hosts Russia's Tu-95, Tu-22M3, and Tu-160 bombers — aircraft regularly used in missile attacks on Ukrainian cities. Saratov Governor Roman Busargin acknowledged a fire at an unspecified "industrial enterprise" and damage from drones to a residential building. The Dyagilevo airfield in Ryazan Oblast, home to air refueling tankers and bomber escort fighters, was also targeted. Ukraine also claims to have struck a logistics center tied to the 30th Motorized Rifle Regiment of Russia's 72nd Division near Kulbaki in Kursk Oblast. "Strikes on military infrastructure will continue until the Russian Federation's armed aggression against Ukraine is completely stopped," Ukraine's General Staff said. The latest wave of Ukrainian strikes underscores Kyiv's evolving long-range strike capability, as well as its efforts to preemptively degrade Russian assets used in air assaults. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on June 1 launched Operation Spiderweb, a daring mass drone attack that damaged 41 Russian heavy bombers at four key airfields throughout the country. The operation reportedly targeted A-50, Tu-95, and Tu-22 M3 planes parked at the Belaya, Diaghilev, Olenya, and Ivanovo air bases, causing approximately $7 billion in damage.

MOSCOW, June 6. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump administration's steps toward building the Golden Dome missile shield are turning space into an arena of armed confrontation, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said in an interview with TASS.

"Steps taken by the Trump administration to develop the US ‘Golden Dome for America' missile defense system, which provides for a significant strengthening of the arsenal of tools to conduct military operations in space, including the deployment of interception systems in orbit, is a direct path not only to the militarization of outer space, but also to its transformation into an arena of armed confrontation," Ryabkov said.

Russia's senior diplomat stressed that such US actions provoke escalation of tensions and an arms race in space paves the way for mutual distrust as well as for serious obstacles to cooperation on inter-state level regarding the peaceful exploration of space.

"All of this is fraught with the most serious negative consequences for international security," Ryabkov continued.

"In order to counter Washington's steps to deploy weapons in outer space, together with our satellite countries, we exert efforts aimed at the early start of negotiations on the development of an international legally binding tool that prevents an arms race in outer space, abbreviated as the Prevention of Arms Race in Space [PAROS], prohibiting the deployment of any type of weapon in outer space, the use of force or threats of force against space objects or with their help," the high-ranking diplomat noted.

On May 20, US President Donald Trump announced his country's strategy regarding how its Golden Dome missile defense shield project would move forward. The administration plans to allocate approximately $175 billion for the project. According to Trump, construction will take a little under three years.</p>

LONDON, June 6. /TASS/. Aggressive rhetoric against Russia coming from representatives of the British government is aimed at diverting the attention of the country's population from the accumulated social and economic problems, Russian Ambassador to London Andrey Kelin told Sky News in an interview.

"This story is as old as the world," Kelin noted. "When the government is not capable of dealing with internal economics and could not provide the population with normal conditions of life, then it tries to find an outside threat and concentrate on this threat."

On June 2, the British authorities published ‘The Strategic Defense Review 2025' document regarding national defense issues, which identified Russia as an ‘immediate and urgent threat' to London.

In view of the provided background, the British government confirmed that it would increase defense spending from the current 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 and will go for increasing this figure to 3% of GDP by 2034.</p>
