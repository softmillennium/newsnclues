                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We have all heard of antibodies – proteins produced by our bodies to bind to viruses or bacteria, marking them for elimination by the immune system. But not all of us are familiar with aptamers: short segments of DNA or RNA that are designed to bind, like antibodies, to specific targets. When new aptamer binders are needed, for example to detect a new virus, they are developed from libraries of millions of nucleic acid sequences from which the best matches for a given target are selected and amplified. Until now, such libraries contained only monovalent binders: sequences that bind to one site on a target molecule. These structures, which viruses use to infect cells, are comprised of three identical subunits presenting three potential binding sites. Unfortunately, using monovalent binders for these three-unit (trimeric) complexes is hit-or-miss. In fact, Maartje Bastings, head of the Programmable Biomaterials Lab in EPFL's School of Engineering, compares it to "throwing a bowl of spaghetti at the wall, as something will certainly stick somewhere." You can't control where a monovalent binder interacts with its target: for example, it may bind to the side of a protein, rather than the binding interface, reducing its functionality. So, we thought: wouldn't it be better or pre-organize our library for binders that fit a target's exact geometry? And this approach turns out to be magically effective." Bastings and her team have recently reported the first technique for producing multimeric aptamers, which target protein complexes with unprecedented precision and functionality. Indeed, the binders developed with the lab's approach, dubbed MEDUSA (Multivalent Evolved DNA-based SUpramolecular Assemblies), yields binding affinities that are between 10 and 1,000 times stronger than those achieved with monovalent binders. In addition to being stronger, they also turned out to be much more selective, which is critical for diagnostics. The research has been published in Nature Nanotechnology. The key to developing trimeric binders is the scaffold: a molecular structure around which three binding units naturally assemble. "We have retro-engineered the natural paradigm seen in viruses, in which multivalent molecular complexes co-evolve, and translated it into a new binder discovery method that allows us to select multivalent binders that can block such viruses," summarizes PhD student and first author Artem Kononenko. Once a first batch of binders is identified, candidates with increasing affinity for their target are developed through an iterative process of selection and amplification called 'evolution'. Looking ahead, the research team aims to shorten this timeframe to better suit the needs of biomedical diagnostics and therapeutics. Another goal is to develop multimeric binders targeting pathogens with even more complex configurations, like Dengue fever (six binding subunits) or anthrax (seven).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are common in NSCLC and have made EGFR-targeting drugs like osimertinib a cornerstone of treatment. Despite their promise, combining these two therapies has proven problematic. Several clinical trials were halted after reporting high incidences of severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs)—such as interstitial pneumonia and hepatitis—linked to the combination. Due to these risks and the lack of mechanistic clarity, there is an urgent need to investigate the cellular drivers of this toxicity and identify safer strategies. A research team from Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute & Hospital published their findings (DOI: 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2024.0269) in Cancer Biology & Medicine, aiming to demystify the heightened immune toxicity triggered by osimertinib-ICI co-treatment. Their results not only offer a compelling explanation for these adverse reactions but also suggest that this toxicity may be preventable through targeted pharmacological intervention. Notably, flow cytometry revealed that EGFR expression was exclusive to macrophages, not T or NK cells. The turning point came when ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, was introduced into the regimen—leading to a marked decrease in inflammatory cytokines despite ongoing tissue-level inflammation. This finding suggests that systemic cytokine release, rather than local tissue damage, may be a more sensitive indicator of irAEs. The study proposes that osimertinib's inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation in macrophages, when combined with ICI-induced immune activation, triggers this inflammatory cascade. These results not only clarify the pathway responsible for irAEs but also spotlight ruxolitinib as a potentially safe and effective countermeasure. Our findings provide a crucial mechanistic link between osimertinib-ICI therapy and the dangerous cytokine surges seen in patients. By pinpointing the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 axis in liver macrophages, we not only clarify the pathogenesis of immune-related toxicity, but also suggest that targeted inhibitors like ruxolitinib can be safely integrated into cancer immunotherapy regimens. This represents a significant step toward safer combination treatments." This research delivers a mechanistic blueprint for understanding and managing irAEs in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients receiving combination therapy. By selectively inhibiting the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 pathway, clinicians may be able to protect patients from serious inflammatory reactions while preserving the anti-cancer potency of both osimertinib and ICIs. These results pave the way for future clinical trials to assess IL-6 pathway blockers as adjunct therapies in cancer immunotherapy. If successful, this strategy could significantly improve patient safety and expand the clinical utility of EGFR-TKI and ICI combination regimens. Osimertinib exacerbates immune checkpoint inhibitor-related severe adverse events by activating the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 pathway in macrophages.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A combination of facial thermal imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) can accurately predict the presence of coronary artery disease, finds research published in the open access journal BMJ Health & Care Informatics. This non-invasive real-time approach is more effective than conventional methods and could be adopted for clinical practice to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and workflow, pending testing on larger and more ethnically diverse numbers of patients, suggest the researchers. Current guidelines for the diagnosis of coronary heart disease rely on probability assessment of risk factors which aren't always very accurate or widely applicable, say the researchers. Thermal imaging, which captures temperature distribution and variations on the object's surface by detecting the infrared radiation emitted by that object, is non-invasive. And it has emerged as a promising tool for disease assessment as it can identify areas of abnormal blood circulation and inflammation from skin temperature patterns. The advent of machine learning technology (AI), with its capacity to extract, process, and integrate complex information, might enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of thermal imaging diagnostics. The researchers therefore set out to look into the feasibility of using thermal imaging plus AI to accurately predict the presence of coronary artery disease without the need for invasive, time consuming techniques in 460 people with suspected heart disease.Their average age was 58; 126 (27.5%) of them were women. Thermal images of their faces were captured before confirmatory examinations to develop and validate an AI assisted imaging model for detecting coronary artery disease. In all, 322 participants (70%) were confirmed to have coronary artery disease. They were also more likely to have lifestyle, clinical, and biochemical risk factors, as well as higher use of preventive meds. The thermal imaging plus AI approach was around 13% better at predicting coronary artery disease than the pre-test risk assessment involving traditional risk factors and clinical signs and symptoms. The approach also effectively identified traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease: high cholesterol; male sex; smoking; excess weight (BMI); fasting blood glucose, as well as indicators of inflammation. But they nevertheless write: "The feasibility of thermal imaging based coronary artery disease prediction suggests potential future applications and research opportunities." They add: "As a biophysiological-based health assessment modality, it provides disease-relevant Information beyond traditional clinical measures that could enhance atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease] and related chronic condition assessment. "The non-contact, real-time nature of it allows for instant disease assessment at the point of care, which could streamline clinical workflows and save time for important physician-patient decision-making. In addition, it has the potential to enable mass prescreening." And they conclude: "Our developed thermal imaging prediction models, based on advanced [machine learning] technology, have exhibited promising potential compared with the current conventional clinical tools. "Further investigations incorporating larger sample sizes and diverse patient populations are needed to validate the external validity and generalisability of the current findings."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Japanese researchers reveal that diets rich in pulses and vegetables may help reduce stress levels—not just through nutrients, but by supporting the growth of specific gut bacteria. In a recent study published in the journal Clinical Nutrition ESPEN, researchers investigated the relationship between diet quality, stress, and gut microbiota. Humans are exposed to stressors daily, and prolonged exposure can have a negative impact on both the body and mind. Besides, it can result in migraines, neurosis, stomach ulcers, anxiety, and depression. Furthermore, epidemiological studies suggest that diet plays a crucial role in stress, with various foods and nutrients affecting stress levels. Nutrient profiling is the science of ranking or classifying foods based on their nutritional value to promote health and prevent disease. Nutrient profile models (NPMs) serve as comprehensive assessment indices that consider multiple nutrients simultaneously, rather than focusing on a single one. Various NPMs have been developed to evaluate diet quality. One such NPM is the Nutrient-Rich Food Index 9.3 (NRF9.3), which can be applied to individual foods, menus, meals, and entire diets. However, there are limited studies on the relationship between health indicators and NRF9.3. Moreover, prior to this research, no study has investigated the relationship between NRF2.3 and the gut microbiota or stress. Foods acted as entry points: Natto, tomatoes, and green peppers were positioned as starting nodes in the network model, initiating the diet→microbiome→stress chain. They used data from the Sukoyaka Health Survey of Japanese adults aged 20–80, conducted twice a year (in winter and summer). This study analyzed data from the summers of 2019 and 2020. The gut microbiota composition was analyzed using shotgun metagenomics. NRF9.3 scores were computed using FFQ data, with higher scores indicating a diet rich in beneficial nutrients (e.g., minerals, dietary fiber, vitamins) and low in nutrients to be moderately consumed (e.g., saturated fat, sodium, added sugars). Hierarchical clustering was used to stratify subjects based on their stress levels. An exploratory probabilistic network modeling analysis was conducted to investigate the statistical associations and possible mediation pathways between gut microbiota, dietary factors, and stress response scores, while adjusting for age, body mass index, and blood pressure. The authors noted that other potential confounders, such as physical activity, socioeconomic status, and probiotic use, could not be adjusted for in this analysis. Age played a hidden role: Older participants showed stronger links between poor diet scores, altered gut bacteria, and higher blood pressure in the pathway analysis. The study included 1,058 healthy adults aged 48.9, on average. Further, cluster 2 had substantially lower NRF9.3 scores than other clusters, indicating poor diet quality. Moreover, cluster 2 had significantly reduced intake of vegetables and pulses compared to other clusters. The researchers further investigated specific food items in the FFQ and estimated individual food intake within nine vegetable- and four pulse-based foods. They found that cluster 2 had significantly lower intake of green peppers, tomatoes, and natto than the other clusters. The researchers found a statistically supported mediation pathway: a relationship between NRF9.3 and Lachnospira, as well as between Lachnospira and stress response scores, but not a direct effect of NRF9.3 on stress scores. Notably, while natto is a traditional Japanese food, the authors contextualize their findings by stating that similar bioactive components can be found in globally consumed fermented foods such as tempeh or kimchi. Stress clusters showed unexpected health patterns: The high-stress group had significantly lower blood pressure than the low-stress cluster—a counterintuitive finding suggesting complex physiological stress adaptations. Taken together, a higher NRF9.3 score was associated with increased relative abundance of Lachnospira and reduced physical and mental stress response scores. Increased Lachnospira abundance was also associated with lower stress response. The relationship between diet quality and stress appears to be mediated via Lachnospira, rather than being a direct effect of diet on stress. Furthermore, increased consumption of green peppers, natto, and tomatoes was associated with higher NRF9.3 scores and Lachnospira abundance, which, in turn, were associated with reduced stress response scores. The study's limitations include the self-reported nature of eating habits and dietary intake, possible selection bias related to a health-conscious, predominantly female Japanese sample, poor generalizability to other populations, limited adjustments for confounders, and the use of a subjective assessment of stress (BJSQ) rather than objective biomarkers. The cross-sectional design also prevents any inference of causality between diet, gut microbiota, and stress. Additional longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether specific dietary components affect the stress response by modulating gut microbiota. The authors note that while natto, tomatoes, and green peppers were identified in this Japanese cohort, similar bioactive components are present in other globally consumed foods, and broader dietary patterns rich in polyphenols, dietary fiber, and fermented foods may also be relevant to stress regulation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conducted by researchers from Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) and the University of West London, the qualitative study involved in-depth interviews with 33 older adults and has been published in the journal PLOS One. As well as not asking for help because of concerns over how others might view them, some participants talked about physical barriers, with standard care equipment and facilities often failing to accommodate individuals with higher body weights, resulting in inadequate support.​ The combination of physical limitations and societal stigma also contributed to feelings of isolation and decreased self-worth among participants.​ Financial hardship was also cited as an unmet need, with one interviewee having lost his full-time job due to pain caused by his obesity. Participants with higher obesity levels reported unmet needs primarily linked to emotional distress, including stress, frustration, social discrimination, isolation, feeling like a burden, lack of housing adaptations and safety, boredom, inability to continue hobbies, and limited access to support. The study also sets out a new framework designed to understand unmet care needs of older adults with obesity. Older adults with obesity face unique challenges in accessing and receiving appropriate social care. Despite growing concerns over obesity's impact on health, its influence on social care needs among this demographic remains underexplored. The hidden challenges faced by these individuals often go unrecognised, leading to unmet need and increased vulnerability. As the population ages and obesity rates continue to rise, it is imperative that our social care systems adapt to meet these evolving needs. Our research makes clear the need for increased awareness among healthcare professionals to better support older adults with obesity, with policy reforms, training programmes that address weight bias and the development of care plans that address the specific barriers faced by this group."
