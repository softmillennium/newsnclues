                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>USA/Syfy's Resident Alien started as a quirky mashup of Northern Exposure and Invader Zim, a fish-out-of-water comedy where Harry Vanderspeigle (Alan Tudyk of Firefly, Rogue One, and Andor), the new doctor in the small town of Patience, Colorado, is actually an alien who wants to take over Earth. Harry's secret was originally only known to Max Hawthorne (Judah Prehn) — a kid with the rare genetic ability to see through alien disguises, who devotes himself to trying to stop Harry's plans — and health-clinic worker Asta Twelvetrees (Sara Tomko), who teaches Harry the value of humanity. Harry spends as much time investigating the murder of the town's last doctor as he does trying to fix his ship and get his mission back on track. The locals write off his weirdness because they're dealing with their own challenges: Asta confronting her abusive ex, her best friend D'arcy Bloom (Alice Wetterlund) dealing with opioid addiction, Max's parents Ben (Levi Fiehler) and Kate (Meredith Garretson) winding up on opposites sides of a debate about bringing a fancy ski resort to Patience. “I think it was a nice way to be introduced to the sci-fi world for people who don't normally like [the genre],” Tomko told Polygon in a video interview. Ben and Kate were abducted by aliens who stole their baby. Asta shared Harry's true identity with D'arcy so she could stop lying about it. Even skeptical Sheriff Mike Thompson (Corey Reynolds) had a close encounter with an extraterrestrial. “What I love about our show is there's Harry's world, which is the world of aliens, and there's people in town who haven't know about that, and you care about them because the writing is so strong that everyone is really well developed,” Garretson told Polygon in a video interview. D'arcy was quick to embrace the chance to help Harry, who is now focused on saving humanity from other aliens. This season, she even travels back in time with Harry to recover alien technology. “I think that science fiction is a perfect slate on which to examine the human experience, because it removes the historical context that humanity is in and puts it in this imagined world,” she told Polygon in a video interview. “How would these humans in a small town deal with the exploding of their worldview? I've always wanted to be part of a sci-fi project like this. Reynolds said he grew up watching the Aliens franchise and RoboCop, and he's excited about the chance to get more involved in Resident Alien's science fiction elements. “I'm proudly a nerd, so this fits my wheelhouse perfectly,” he told Polygon. Acknowledging the existence of aliens has fundamentally shifted the dynamics in Patience's sheriff's office, where Mike has often been dismissive of Liv's ideas. Now they're working together to uncover a dangerous conspiracy and help an alien tracking cyborg played by Lost's Peter Bach. You don't earn any more credibility in Mike's world faster than being right. Scenes involving alien spaceships and time portals cost a lot more than ones set in Patience's bar or city hall, and showrunner Chris Sheridan has had to get creative as the show's science fiction elements have expanded — especially since the series had its budget significantly cut going into season 4. “That saves us Alan getting in and out of makeup,” Sheridan told Polygon. Among all the ideas Sheridan had for hiding the budget cuts, that one stuck with him because it fit so well with the show's themes and plot, where Harry has slowly gained more emotional awareness and attachments as he's come to appreciate humans. Resident Alien season 4 premieres on Syfy and USA at 11 p.m. Episodes will be available to stream on Peacock one week later. The best of Polygon in your inbox, every Friday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The trove of papers from pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing was discovered in a loft. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A trove of Alan Turing's papers, including his own personal copy of his PhD dissertation, is going up for auction June 17 after narrowly avoiding destruction. They include not only Turing's signed dissertation, but also 1937's "On Computable Numbers," considered the first computer programming manual, and 1952's "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis," Turing's last major published work. Turing was an English mathematician, codebreaker and one of the first computer scientists. When she moved into a care home almost a decade later, one of her daughters found the papers and considered shredding them. But she asked around the family and decided to get them appraised instead, taking them along to specialists Rare Books Auctions in a carrier bag. "Nothing could've prepared me for what I was about to find in that carrier bag," Rare Books Auction director Jim Spencer said in a statement. They are expected to fetch a price of 40,000 to 60,000 British pounds ($54,220 to $81,324) for the copy of "On Computable Numbers," which introduced the idea of a "universal computing machine," and a similar price for the signed dissertation. “We even have Turing's first published paper from 1935 – Equivalence of Left and Right Almost Periodicity – which is simply a single sheet of paper," Spencer said. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. But in 1952, while reporting a burglary, he acknowledged a sexual relationship with another man to police and was persecuted under an 1885 law that criminalized homosexual acts as "gross indecency." He was also denied entry into the United States. Turing was found dead in his home of cyanide poisoning, which may have been a result of suicide or an accident resulting from a chemistry experiment he was running at the time. His case inspired a 2009 apology from the British government and a 2017 law, known as the "Alan Turing Law," that retroactively pardons people convicted under historical legislation in England and Wales for homosexual acts.

Thankfully, Evil Eye prides itself on its ability to go for broke. It's the proper heightening of storytelling, stakes, and character relationships that you'd hope for from a show's second season. The two are inexorably intertwined and turned into something original that doesn't cheat its way out of what happened in the finale, but still effectively builds upon it with a more effective and narratively suspenseful presentation of events. The series finds itself at an especially crucial inflection point as Momo and Okarun's duo becomes a trio with Jiji. Many series fumble as they expand their core cast, yet Jiji becomes Evil Eye‘s secret weapon, both figuratively and literally. Jiji was a recent addition who came in at the end of Dan Da Dan's first season and put a huge wrench in Momo and Okarun's budding prospective romance. However, it's hard not to be a Jiji fan after the burst of affable character development that he experiences here. This trend continues in Evil Eye with the creepy Kito family, outrageous elderly landlords who are another strong example of terrifying occult creatures who have mundane, normalized attitudes so they feel more like put-upon people instead of folkloric monsters. It's a good fit for Dan Da Dan that effortlessly meshes with the anime's reverence towards iconic horror and sci-fi texts, but it's also a style and subgenre that wasn't explored during season one. There are some great set-pieces around these enemies, but it feels like they really could have been triggered by any occult obstacle. Drama is born out of the Kitos' victory over Okarun and Jiji, which pushes Momo into a difficult situation. However, giving the Kito family greater authority so that they actually defeat Okarun and Jiji might have helped these monsters stand out a little more. The Kito may slightly lack impact, but they're merely an aperitif for Evil Eye's main event – the giant Kuragari Serpent Lord –  a Mongolian Death Worm – who definitely doesn't disappoint. This creature was actually teased during the tail end of season one. Dan Da Dan has been rich in disturbing creature designs and the Great Serpent Lord indulges in uncomfortable Eldritch imagery that feels appropriate for this unexplainable and all-encompassing invader. The anime continues to effortlessly blend actual folklore and urban legends with gripping action storytelling. There's a reverence to this monstrosity that praises him like some sick God. Looking beyond the occult action, Evil Eye is an utterly gorgeous film that's on par with anything from season one. This story turns to more stylized visuals for its emotional moments, like heightened watercolors that dominate melancholy flashbacks. It's such a beautiful and visually inventive expression from Science Saru that reiterates why Dan Da Dan is currently one of the best in the biz when it comes to creative shonen action. You'll curse your eyes for needing to blink and missing a single frame of mayhem. If nothing else, it's just so much fun to spend time with these characters, watch them gain ground, and become more powerful in this beautifully unique universe. If you want a drink thrown in your face, talk to him about "Silent Night, Deadly Night Part II," but he'll always happily talk about the "Puppet Master" franchise. ‘The Summer Hikaru Died' Trailer – Coming-of-Age Horror Anime Drops on Netflix Next Month Go Nagai's ‘Devilman Lady' – Revisiting the Anime Horror Hidden Gem for #AniMay Netflix's ‘Devil May Cry' Hits a Bloody Bullseye With Hellbeasts, Brutal Battles & Buffoonery [Review] “Devil May Cry” Trailer – Dante Cuts Lives Into Pieces in Netflix Anime Series Anime Film ‘Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle' Set for September Theatrical Release</p>

Dylan Thuras: It was 1988, and all year, Jim Weiner had been having a terrible time sleeping. He was having nightmares, but these were not normal nightmares, because Jim said he felt like he was awake, almost like it was some kind of sleep paralysis. He'd wake up to the overwhelming sense that there was someone in the room with him. He couldn't move anything but his eyes. And often, his twin brother Jack was there, along with two college friends, Chuck and Charlie. Jim would be lying on this table in a bright white room. At first, Jim thought he knew what was causing this strange, awful sensation. Years earlier, he'd been in a bad accident. He told his psychiatrist, it seems like things were under control. They were going to get better. But then Jim got on the phone with his brother Jack, and they made a very unnerving discovery. This was happening to Jack too. Jack said he was seeing the same things. And as they dug deeper, the brothers would trace this strange sensation to an incident that happened more than a decade earlier, in the north woods of Maine, in the Allagash Wilderness Waterway. I'm Dylan Thuras, and this is Atlas Obscura. And today, we are talking UFOs. And we're doing it National Parks style. This is an edited transcript of the Atlas Obscura Podcast: a celebration of the world's strange, incredible, and wondrous places. Find the show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major podcast apps. Dylan: National Parks are pretty much universally beloved. But there's also this other side to these enormous wild places. People die or disappear in National Parks actually pretty frequently. I don't say this to discourage anyone from visiting the parks. And there's a hidden side to everything, including these places that we revere. So I am here today with two people who know more about the dark and sinister side of National Parks than I would guess almost anyone else. Danielle LaRock and Cassie Yahnian are hosts of the podcast National Park After Dark, a podcast for the morbid outdoor enthusiast, which is not a thing that I knew I was until I heard your work. So, Danielle, Cassie, thanks for coming on the show. Danielle LaRock: Thank you so much for the lovely introduction. Meeting of the morbid outdoor enthusiasts. Yeah, so where are you two right now in the world? Cassie: Yeah, and I'm in Vermont. I went to college in Bennington. It's also actually a place where there's like all these weird, mysterious disappearances. There are some vibes in that Bennington Triangle. And we're going to get back to Jack and Jim's story in just a second. But to further set the mood, why don't you give me a quick lightning round of a few of your favorite morbid stories that have taken place in national parks. In the 1800s, bird populations were being decimated for fashion and one of the first men who tried to save them was killed for it. Cassie: Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park. A backcountry ranger went missing while out on patrol and then the largest search operation ever recorded in those parks uncovered a complicated marriage, a mistress, and reasons he may have wanted to disappear. Graham Parsons' friends wanted him to go out like he lived: as a rock star. After his untimely end, they stole his body from a plane, loaded it into a friend's hearse, drove it into Joshua Tree, and attempted a makeshift cremation. Dylan: It makes me think the cremation went poorly. Dylan: That's a lot of, like, death, murder, mayhem in national parks. It just makes me feel like people, I don't know, maybe there's just something about national parks where people feel like they can get away with things. So, okay, let's talk about one of these cases. Let's get back to our brothers, Jim and Jack. And this story takes place in the Allagash Wilderness, which is technically not a national park, but an enormous state park in Maine. More than a decade before the brothers are having these strange visions, back in 1976, Jack and Jim are in their 20s. And what's going on with them? In August of 1976, the twins, Jim and Jack, along with Charlie Foltz and Chuck Rak, were in the midst of a two-week camping trip and fishing trip along the Allagash Waterway. The area, like you said, is part of the National Wild and Scenic River System. It's super remote, and this area in particular is about 93 miles long worth of ribbons of lakes and streams, and it's just so beautiful. And the four of them had prepared for this trip for nearly a year beforehand, prepping, researching, getting ready to go. So at this point in time, they're dropped off in the wilderness by a bush plane, and they began their journey. Dylan: And you said they got dropped off by a plane. So, I mean, they're, like, totally alone out there. It's, like, not the place you would bump into a random stranger. They seem quite far out in the wilderness. Danielle: You can't just drive or walk up to a place like this. You need to intentionally seek it out. There's a few other campers around, moreso people that are doing a similar thing, right? So, canoers and paddlers—actually, this day, they run into another group of campers on a lake that they are also planning to camp on. So, they actually offered to search for him. That's when the entire group all initially spot something strange that they, at first, just kind of write off as, ah, that's a weird, strange light in the sky. All of these people see this bright light, and it was in the eastern part of the sky, and it was moving slightly. And at first, they collectively thought they were maybe looking at Mars because it had this reddish tint to it. But suddenly, they all kind of look at each other like, this is weird. So, it closed in kind of like an eyelid shutting, and then it blinked out from sight. The kid came back, and it was fine. So, this sort of strange thing happens as they're looking for this lost camper, and they find the camper. Seems like that was not the end of things. Cassie: So, later that evening, after settling into camp and making a large fire on the lake shore, the men decided that they wanted to go back onto the lake and do a night paddle. And while Chuck was paddling, he suddenly felt like something was off, and he really felt like he could feel someone watching him. So, he threw his gaze over his shoulder, and he saw this ball of light rising from the trees about 200 yards away. Jim, Jack, and Charlie, they all turned around at this point to look, and a large round bright light was rising more above this tree line. Dylan: I would be pretty highly alarmed here if this is what was going on. Danielle: So, after they all noticed this light rising up, they noticed a couple of things. First of all, it's way closer than whatever they saw hours prior. Chuck decides to lean down, grab his flashlight, points it at this source of light, and clicks the flashlight on and off in the universal, at least earthly, signal for SOS. And suddenly, this light source emits a light source of its own, kind of like a searchlight, and starts scanning the water, and it's moving in their direction. So, now, collectively, all the men are having this oh crap moment. Danielle: And start paddling like crazy back to their camp. So, they get back to the shoreline, but interestingly, there's a chunk of time that they can't recall, at least at first. So, they all remember seeing this light and turning to paddle back to shore, and then the next thing they remember is skidding up onto the shoreline to their campsite, where just 20 minutes prior, they had set a huge fire. So, they clocked that as strange, and they kind of talked amongst each other for a brief minute about, huh, that was kind of weird, right? And then they all remember feeling like they were in this daze, and kind of equated it to after you come out of anesthesia, you're awake and you're conscious, but you're loopy and kind of scatterbrained. And they just went to sleep. The next day, they get up, they ran into a ranger, actually, and inquired if, you know, did you see anything like that? Dylan: Yeah, what could that have been? And he actually said, well, you know, there's a new hardware store out in Millinocket that had those, you know, those big Hollywood floodlights. And, you know, that is dozens of miles away. It does not match the description of what they encountered. So, they kind of said, oh, okay. Danielle: That must be it, right. But, yeah, so anyways, after that, they kind of dropped it, surprisingly. They went on with their entire lives. We're now in 1988 where this is starting to surface again. Jim is having these crazy night visions. He talks to his brother, Jack. How does this all sort of start to connect for them? How do they start to realize that maybe there's something more to this past experience than what they initially thought? Cassie: Well, then they ended up contacting Chuck and Charlie to speak about that night again, to be like, hey, are you experiencing any of this? Like, we're both having these weird dreams. And then it turned out that all of them were experiencing the same thing, and it was kind of that moment where they're like, wait, we forgot about this. We kind of pushed it to the side, but maybe there's something more here that we didn't realize. And of all people, they recommend him to a ufologist. All four of the men agreed to do that. And separately, they start to uncover eerily similar experiences of lost memories from that evening. Dylan: To quickly recap, Jim, Jack, Chuck, Charlie, they go on this trip in the 70s, they've got this crazy experience with these floating lights, they kind of lose time, which is like classic UFO stuff, you know, you're like, I was only gone for five minutes, what do you mean? And then a decade later, they end up talking to this alien researcher, they do this hypnotic regression therapy. And over the course of that two years, they all end up with this sort of picture, or they converge on this understanding, of what happened. So what do they end up saying happened during that key, like missing period? So long story short: They all—after two years—they come to realize that under hypnosis, they were finding out the same things. Essentially, they all recalled being aboard a spacecraft, where they were all subjected to different medical examinations by some of these humanoid entities. They all described them as having large heads, dark eyes, slender bodies, they don't speak with words, but rather telepathically send messages to them. And that was what was coming up also in their dreams and starting to kind of surface that way. Yeah, what you're describing sounds a lot like the visions that Jim described having 10 years later. Now they're all under the impression of, wow, we were gone for hours. Dylan: And they like, they ended up, you know, sort of becoming a little bit famous, right? And to be clear, you know, there, at first they were very scared. They were—this was traumatic memories for them. This was not something they looked back on fondly. After this collective understanding of this is a shared experience, or at least that's what they were under the impression of, they come to this sort of solace that, you know, this happened and let's own it and let's start talking about it. And for years, they went on different speaking circuits. They talk a lot at different UFO conferences. They became known as the Allagash Four, this kind of like, you know, group of abductees who could just talk about this experience and kind of shared it. Chuck came forward and said, basically, yeah, some of this is bullshit, or like, we made some of this up. Like, did he actually say it was a hoax or was he sort of just like walking back some of it? Danielle: He walked back some of it. So, his stance was that the incident with the other campers and seeing that strange light was true. Danielle: And also their experience on the lake, just the four of them, was true. Where he started to go off on his own was saying that the abduction part was fabricated. But the other guys point to, yeah, well, the only reason he's saying that now after years of us going on Joan Rivers and doing different television programs and all of this and wanting to write books, and the only reason he's saying that is because we had a big falling out in our friendship. You guys spend a lot of time out, way out in the wilderness, you know, under the night sky. Cassie: It would be very unbelievable for me to think that we are the only planet with life on it. I think that it is way more unrealistic to think that we are the only people or life forms that exist in the entire universe. Danielle: I co-sign all of that. Dylan: Have you two ever seen anything truly weird and unexplainable on any of your adventures? Danielle: I saw Starlink and thought it was UFOs. Maybe I'm more of a skeptic than you two. It's clear that, like, for some of these kind of abductee cases, like, something is going on. People are having very intense and genuinely traumatic experiences. They are experiencing something real for them. And I can't help but note that when all this is happening, like the late 80s and the early 90s, this is an absolute alien craze, right? All of this stuff is happening on TV about, like, Area 51. I think it's possible, you know, they're doing this hypnotic regression therapy. And one of the big critiques of this is that it can, like, implant memories. And the person who did this to them also, like, wrote a book about it, and I think probably did pretty well on that book. It seems likely that they saw something very strange, to which I have no explanation of. Danielle: So now that we're all kind of coming around to the government being like, yeah, aliens are real, you know, that's not new. Dylan: Or at least we don't know what any of this stuff is. We can't confirm nor deny. But you know, now, as time goes on, we're starting to accept that aliens might be real. Whether or not they're the gray aliens that we think of when we imagine an alien, or if they're something completely different, we're coming around to the thought that we aren't alone in the universe. Yeah, I think one of the things I like about this story is just that, especially when you're out there in the wilderness at night on your own, whatever—sometimes I do these bike rides, these, like, late night bike rides that go, it's like a full moon ride, and we all go look at the full moon, it's really nice—and I'm riding through a really familiar trail, but I'm riding at night, my little flashlight is shining. And the whole thing just starts to take on this other terrifying kind of aspect. And I can't really explain it. But I just, I do think that sometimes we just have experiences that we cannot explain. And there's something about being in the woods at night that just evokes those kinds of experiences. And I almost don't feel like I need an explanation to understand that feeling of: something is happening that I can't quite explain. How has covering all this affected your relationship with national parks and wilderness areas? Does it ever freak you out? Or are you kind of like, this is what we live for? There are, I think, on the brighter side, sometimes these stories, I like to feel like I am more prepared and more knowledgeable. But on the other side, when I have extensively researched a grizzly bear mauling, I cannot help but worry when I'm sleeping outdoors in grizzly territory. That's quite a practical, real thing to be like, yeah, don't attract the grizzly to the tent. Whatever that weird sound was, don't worry about it. Dylan: That was Danielle LaRock and Cassie Yahnian. They are the hosts of a really delightful, sometimes terrifying podcast called National Park After Dark. It's basically kind of true crime survival adventure in national parks.

Dylan Thuras: It was 1988, and all year, Jim Weiner had been having a terrible time sleeping. He was having nightmares, but these were not normal nightmares, because Jim said he felt like he was awake, almost like it was some kind of sleep paralysis. He'd wake up to the overwhelming sense that there was someone in the room with him. He couldn't move anything but his eyes. And often, his twin brother Jack was there, along with two college friends, Chuck and Charlie. Jim would be lying on this table in a bright white room. At first, Jim thought he knew what was causing this strange, awful sensation. Years earlier, he'd been in a bad accident. He told his psychiatrist, it seems like things were under control. They were going to get better. But then Jim got on the phone with his brother Jack, and they made a very unnerving discovery. This was happening to Jack too. Jack said he was seeing the same things. And as they dug deeper, the brothers would trace this strange sensation to an incident that happened more than a decade earlier, in the north woods of Maine, in the Allagash Wilderness Waterway. I'm Dylan Thuras, and this is Atlas Obscura. And today, we are talking UFOs. And we're doing it National Parks style. This is an edited transcript of the Atlas Obscura Podcast: a celebration of the world's strange, incredible, and wondrous places. Find the show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major podcast apps. Dylan: National Parks are pretty much universally beloved. But there's also this other side to these enormous wild places. People die or disappear in National Parks actually pretty frequently. I don't say this to discourage anyone from visiting the parks. And there's a hidden side to everything, including these places that we revere. So I am here today with two people who know more about the dark and sinister side of National Parks than I would guess almost anyone else. Danielle LaRock and Cassie Yahnian are hosts of the podcast National Park After Dark, a podcast for the morbid outdoor enthusiast, which is not a thing that I knew I was until I heard your work. So, Danielle, Cassie, thanks for coming on the show. Danielle LaRock: Thank you so much for the lovely introduction. Meeting of the morbid outdoor enthusiasts. Yeah, so where are you two right now in the world? Cassie: Yeah, and I'm in Vermont. I went to college in Bennington. It's also actually a place where there's like all these weird, mysterious disappearances. There are some vibes in that Bennington Triangle. And we're going to get back to Jack and Jim's story in just a second. But to further set the mood, why don't you give me a quick lightning round of a few of your favorite morbid stories that have taken place in national parks. In the 1800s, bird populations were being decimated for fashion and one of the first men who tried to save them was killed for it. Cassie: Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park. A backcountry ranger went missing while out on patrol and then the largest search operation ever recorded in those parks uncovered a complicated marriage, a mistress, and reasons he may have wanted to disappear. Graham Parsons' friends wanted him to go out like he lived: as a rock star. After his untimely end, they stole his body from a plane, loaded it into a friend's hearse, drove it into Joshua Tree, and attempted a makeshift cremation. Dylan: It makes me think the cremation went poorly. Dylan: That's a lot of, like, death, murder, mayhem in national parks. It just makes me feel like people, I don't know, maybe there's just something about national parks where people feel like they can get away with things. So, okay, let's talk about one of these cases. Let's get back to our brothers, Jim and Jack. And this story takes place in the Allagash Wilderness, which is technically not a national park, but an enormous state park in Maine. More than a decade before the brothers are having these strange visions, back in 1976, Jack and Jim are in their 20s. And what's going on with them? In August of 1976, the twins, Jim and Jack, along with Charlie Foltz and Chuck Rak, were in the midst of a two-week camping trip and fishing trip along the Allagash Waterway. The area, like you said, is part of the National Wild and Scenic River System. It's super remote, and this area in particular is about 93 miles long worth of ribbons of lakes and streams, and it's just so beautiful. And the four of them had prepared for this trip for nearly a year beforehand, prepping, researching, getting ready to go. So at this point in time, they're dropped off in the wilderness by a bush plane, and they began their journey. Dylan: And you said they got dropped off by a plane. So, I mean, they're, like, totally alone out there. It's, like, not the place you would bump into a random stranger. They seem quite far out in the wilderness. Danielle: You can't just drive or walk up to a place like this. You need to intentionally seek it out. There's a few other campers around, moreso people that are doing a similar thing, right? So, canoers and paddlers—actually, this day, they run into another group of campers on a lake that they are also planning to camp on. So, they actually offered to search for him. That's when the entire group all initially spot something strange that they, at first, just kind of write off as, ah, that's a weird, strange light in the sky. All of these people see this bright light, and it was in the eastern part of the sky, and it was moving slightly. And at first, they collectively thought they were maybe looking at Mars because it had this reddish tint to it. But suddenly, they all kind of look at each other like, this is weird. So, it closed in kind of like an eyelid shutting, and then it blinked out from sight. The kid came back, and it was fine. So, this sort of strange thing happens as they're looking for this lost camper, and they find the camper. Seems like that was not the end of things. Cassie: So, later that evening, after settling into camp and making a large fire on the lake shore, the men decided that they wanted to go back onto the lake and do a night paddle. And while Chuck was paddling, he suddenly felt like something was off, and he really felt like he could feel someone watching him. So, he threw his gaze over his shoulder, and he saw this ball of light rising from the trees about 200 yards away. Jim, Jack, and Charlie, they all turned around at this point to look, and a large round bright light was rising more above this tree line. Dylan: I would be pretty highly alarmed here if this is what was going on. Danielle: So, after they all noticed this light rising up, they noticed a couple of things. First of all, it's way closer than whatever they saw hours prior. Chuck decides to lean down, grab his flashlight, points it at this source of light, and clicks the flashlight on and off in the universal, at least earthly, signal for SOS. And suddenly, this light source emits a light source of its own, kind of like a searchlight, and starts scanning the water, and it's moving in their direction. So, now, collectively, all the men are having this oh crap moment. Danielle: And start paddling like crazy back to their camp. So, they get back to the shoreline, but interestingly, there's a chunk of time that they can't recall, at least at first. So, they all remember seeing this light and turning to paddle back to shore, and then the next thing they remember is skidding up onto the shoreline to their campsite, where just 20 minutes prior, they had set a huge fire. So, they clocked that as strange, and they kind of talked amongst each other for a brief minute about, huh, that was kind of weird, right? And then they all remember feeling like they were in this daze, and kind of equated it to after you come out of anesthesia, you're awake and you're conscious, but you're loopy and kind of scatterbrained. And they just went to sleep. The next day, they get up, they ran into a ranger, actually, and inquired if, you know, did you see anything like that? Dylan: Yeah, what could that have been? And he actually said, well, you know, there's a new hardware store out in Millinocket that had those, you know, those big Hollywood floodlights. And, you know, that is dozens of miles away. It does not match the description of what they encountered. So, they kind of said, oh, okay. Danielle: That must be it, right. But, yeah, so anyways, after that, they kind of dropped it, surprisingly. They went on with their entire lives. We're now in 1988 where this is starting to surface again. Jim is having these crazy night visions. He talks to his brother, Jack. How does this all sort of start to connect for them? How do they start to realize that maybe there's something more to this past experience than what they initially thought? Cassie: Well, then they ended up contacting Chuck and Charlie to speak about that night again, to be like, hey, are you experiencing any of this? Like, we're both having these weird dreams. And then it turned out that all of them were experiencing the same thing, and it was kind of that moment where they're like, wait, we forgot about this. We kind of pushed it to the side, but maybe there's something more here that we didn't realize. And of all people, they recommend him to a ufologist. All four of the men agreed to do that. And separately, they start to uncover eerily similar experiences of lost memories from that evening. Dylan: To quickly recap, Jim, Jack, Chuck, Charlie, they go on this trip in the 70s, they've got this crazy experience with these floating lights, they kind of lose time, which is like classic UFO stuff, you know, you're like, I was only gone for five minutes, what do you mean? And then a decade later, they end up talking to this alien researcher, they do this hypnotic regression therapy. And over the course of that two years, they all end up with this sort of picture, or they converge on this understanding, of what happened. So what do they end up saying happened during that key, like missing period? So long story short: They all—after two years—they come to realize that under hypnosis, they were finding out the same things. Essentially, they all recalled being aboard a spacecraft, where they were all subjected to different medical examinations by some of these humanoid entities. They all described them as having large heads, dark eyes, slender bodies, they don't speak with words, but rather telepathically send messages to them. And that was what was coming up also in their dreams and starting to kind of surface that way. Yeah, what you're describing sounds a lot like the visions that Jim described having 10 years later. Now they're all under the impression of, wow, we were gone for hours. Dylan: And they like, they ended up, you know, sort of becoming a little bit famous, right? And to be clear, you know, there, at first they were very scared. They were—this was traumatic memories for them. This was not something they looked back on fondly. After this collective understanding of this is a shared experience, or at least that's what they were under the impression of, they come to this sort of solace that, you know, this happened and let's own it and let's start talking about it. And for years, they went on different speaking circuits. They talk a lot at different UFO conferences. They became known as the Allagash Four, this kind of like, you know, group of abductees who could just talk about this experience and kind of shared it. Chuck came forward and said, basically, yeah, some of this is bullshit, or like, we made some of this up. Like, did he actually say it was a hoax or was he sort of just like walking back some of it? Danielle: He walked back some of it. So, his stance was that the incident with the other campers and seeing that strange light was true. Danielle: And also their experience on the lake, just the four of them, was true. Where he started to go off on his own was saying that the abduction part was fabricated. But the other guys point to, yeah, well, the only reason he's saying that now after years of us going on Joan Rivers and doing different television programs and all of this and wanting to write books, and the only reason he's saying that is because we had a big falling out in our friendship. You guys spend a lot of time out, way out in the wilderness, you know, under the night sky. Cassie: It would be very unbelievable for me to think that we are the only planet with life on it. I think that it is way more unrealistic to think that we are the only people or life forms that exist in the entire universe. Danielle: I co-sign all of that. Dylan: Have you two ever seen anything truly weird and unexplainable on any of your adventures? Danielle: I saw Starlink and thought it was UFOs. Maybe I'm more of a skeptic than you two. It's clear that, like, for some of these kind of abductee cases, like, something is going on. People are having very intense and genuinely traumatic experiences. They are experiencing something real for them. And I can't help but note that when all this is happening, like the late 80s and the early 90s, this is an absolute alien craze, right? All of this stuff is happening on TV about, like, Area 51. I think it's possible, you know, they're doing this hypnotic regression therapy. And one of the big critiques of this is that it can, like, implant memories. And the person who did this to them also, like, wrote a book about it, and I think probably did pretty well on that book. It seems likely that they saw something very strange, to which I have no explanation of. Danielle: So now that we're all kind of coming around to the government being like, yeah, aliens are real, you know, that's not new. Dylan: Or at least we don't know what any of this stuff is. We can't confirm nor deny. But you know, now, as time goes on, we're starting to accept that aliens might be real. Whether or not they're the gray aliens that we think of when we imagine an alien, or if they're something completely different, we're coming around to the thought that we aren't alone in the universe.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A war of words between SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump could lead to significant fallout for U.S.-led space exploration. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. An explosive, and very public, feud between President Donald Trump and SpaceX founder Elon Musk on Thursday (June 5) has raised doubts over the future of America's space industry. The war of words could place $22 billion of SpaceX's government contracts with multiple U.S. space programs at risk, according to one estimate, although the real figure — which remains classified — could be significantly higher. In light of the President's statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately pic.twitter.com/NG9sijjkgWJune 5, 2025 The disagreement began on Tuesday (June 3) when Musk criticized the administration's proposed tax and spending bill on his social media platform X. "This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.

This then escalated into a full-blown social media feud on Thursday, with Musk claiming that Trump's name appears in unreleased files relating to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. "This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted," representatives wrote on X. Trump then claimed Musk "just went CRAZY," posting: "The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!" NASA is investing $4 billion into Starship's development, and canceling its contract could seriously handicap NASA and the future of U.S.-led space exploration. While other competitors exist, such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin and Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, they lag far behind SpaceX. —Facing steep funding cuts, scientists propose using black holes as particle colliders instead of building new ones on Earth The Starliner capsule is not yet certified to fly operational astronaut missions and was responsible for "stranding" two astronauts on the ISS for nine months last year. The astronauts returned to Earth on March 18 aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule, and neither Boeing nor NASA have offered any significant updates into fixes that will make Starliner flightworthy. NASA's deputy administrator Lori Garver told Reuters that, as well as not being in national interests, canceling SpaceX's contacts would probably not be legal. However, she also added that "a rogue CEO threatening to decommission spacecraft, putting astronauts' lives at risk, is untenable." Pandora is the trending news editor at Live Science.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Supernatural's fifteen seasons on the air, the horror fantasy delved into obscure monster lore, urban legends, religions, and more. Sam and Dean Winchester traversed the country several times, hunting for everything that went bump in the night. The iconic episode features a hilarious real-life joke in the form of tweets by Misha Collins. "The French Mistake" opens with Balthazar showing up to give Sam and Dean a key before sending them to an alternate reality. Sam and Dean crash through the window in Bobby's house and end up on a film set, where they're the two lead actors on a TV show called Supernatural. The meta episode playfully takes shots at the cast and crew alike, featuring characters based on director Robert Singer, creator Eric Kripke, and showrunner at the time, Sera Gamble. Sam and Dean are thrust into the lives of their alter egos, Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, who apparently don't get along. As the boys delve deeper into the lives of their respective actors, they learn that Jared has an alpaca and a giant portrait of himself riding a horse, and that Jensen has an aquarium in his trailer and used to be in a soap opera. Sam and Dean run up the actor's credit cards, buying the ingredients they needed for a spell. Supernatural was never meant to go beyond five seasons, and fans still question whether the show should have ended earlier than season 15. Whether it's watching Sam and Dean try to act, or seeing the crew discuss Sam and Dean attempting to kill an extra, to Eric Kripke walking straight into gunfire, and getting shot multiple times before going down, "The French Mistake" is easily one of the best and funniest episodes of Supernatural. It's no wonder it's not just Jared Padalecki's favorite episode, but also Misha Collins and Eric Kripke's. Sam and Dean first run into their co-star Misha, mistaking him for Cas. They ask about the key from Balthazar and "Castiel" responds accordingly, but when Sam and Dean ask about the "TV crap," Misha breaks character. As they walk away, Misha calls after them, thinking it is all a joke. Like the Winchesters, Castiel has also died a few times in Supernatural, only to be brought back every time for some higher purpose. When Sam and Dean have a rough go at acting, Misha starts to get frustrated with how many takes they need to film the scene. Collins revealed at a convention that wanted to "douche the character up as much as possible." He pushes one crew member away and ignores another. During a break in filming, Misha sends another fantastic tweet that Misha Collins posted a few hours after the first. Virgil popped up and held a knife to Misha's throat before he could press send. This final tweet never got posted in real life either, but he did keep the meta, reality-hopping story going with a final tweet. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Be the first to post your thoughts. The Supernatural episode "Baby" was the most-watched in Season 11, thanks to its unique and groundbreaking premise. Eight years later, The Handmaid's Tale continues to have the same impact today as when it first aired. Even one of the stars' wives agrees. A new report suggests that when the SkyDance Media and Paramount merger finalizes, the new company will make a massive mistake with Star Trek.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is the moment ghost hunters visiting caves in the Peak District captured ‘crying child ghosts' and ‘screams for help' on camera. Ghost hunter Tony Ferguson, accompanied by fellow paranormal-enthusiasts Jon Brown and his friend, Simon, captured the chilling footage during a visit to the haunted Hidden Druids Caves. Stunned by what they filmed, the trio caught ghosts warning them to ‘get out.' "At first, we heard a pair of boots clunking behind us, before children's laughter and a woman telling us to get out.” Tony said: “It was too strange to be a coincidence. Why would a lone woman or man be there?” Tony, 40, explained that he always had an affinity for the paranormal. Being young my parents thought I didn't like visiting, but as I got older, they started talking about the house and how it was haunted. Tony officially started Ghosthunting in 2016, supported by friends like John (Exploring the Afterlife) and Simon (GS Searching for Ghosts). Tony concluded that the video was one of his most compelling yet. He said: “All three of us were silent on the way home. In cases like these I know your mind can play tricks on you, but there was something incredibly heavy about that spot.” Get all the latest and breaking news in Yorkshire by signing up to our newsletter here.
