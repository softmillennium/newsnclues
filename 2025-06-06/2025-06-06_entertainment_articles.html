                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vans Warped Tour might be one of the best-selling festivals of 2025, but organizers say no one music act is responsible for moving the bulk of the 240,000 tickets sold so far across three U.S. cities. Indeed, the brand name alone seems to have been enough. “We sold the vast majority of those tickets before we had a lineup,” says Kevin Lyman, founder and producer of the traveling punk show, which ran from 1995 to 2018 before returning this year for a limited 30th anniversary run. Lyman, who has partnered with Live Nation festival company Insomniac for this year's Warped, is working from a makeshift office and headquarters after the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year forced him to leave his Altadena home, which was damaged but largely spared from the blaze. “I think there's nostalgia in the market, but it's not just for the music — people are longing for events that are affordable and give them a chance to discover something,” says Lyman. Prices for this year's Warped Tour are $149 for a two-day pass, and the tour is much shorter, with just three stops this year instead of the typical 36 markets. Two of the three markets piggyback off events organized by Insomniac: Warped's Washington, D.C. stop, from June 14-15, comes two weeks after Insomniac's Project Glow EDM fest; while the Orlando stop, Nov. 15-16, takes place one week after EDC Orlando at Camping World Stadium. Warped Tour is also coming to Long Beach, Calif., from July 26-27 at Shoreline Waterfront Park. That's likely more tickets than were sold at Coachella this year, which took place over two consecutive three-day weekends, sources tell Billboard. Billboard recently caught up with Lyman to discuss the 30th anniversary tour, including how he pitched it to Steven Van Doren, son of Vans founder Paul Van Doren; his expectations from the fans; and whether the 2025 outing is a one-and-done or has the potential to return in 2026 and beyond. What made you decide to bring Warped Tour back? People don't miss something until it's taken away. And then, when we took it away, people realized that there was a place for something like Warped Tour. But by then I was busy doing other things — traveling, teaching my class at USC and working on other projects. What kind of reception have you received so far? I think it's been exciting because the bands that remember Warped Tour remember how important it was to their careers, and the younger bands now are super excited to be able to have that experience and be part of it. Why did you bring in Insomniac for this year's Warped Tour? There's a lot of people over there that grew up around Warped Tour, attended in the past and even worked on Warped Tour. Maureen Valker-Barlow, who works as a senior vp at Insomniac and landed her first job at Warped Tour, approached me, and it was easy for us to figure out how to work together. They have great people over there like Amanda Phelan, who is a great booker, and Maureen, who I previously mentioned, handling sponsorship, as well as Chris Barlow and Nathan Armstrong in production. They've given me a little bit more of that structure. What was it like approaching Vans to do another tour? That was easy, because Steve Van Doren and myself go back — we're talking 25 years of Warped Tour and years before that. It was easy to go over there and say, “Hey, here's the idea, let's bring it back with these people. I have faith in them.”  Sure, there was a lot of paperwork, but it only took ten minutes of conversation to get this thing going. Not at all, because I knew from the beginning that Warped would only work if we kept the ticket price fair. I feel strongly that a $149, two-day ticket is affordable to our fans. I think 90% of the reason that people are getting turned off by festivals is because they're too expensive. Warped was always the show for people that maybe didn't have that money for some of the other festivals. It also helps that we delivered the lineup. You've got some big names on the lineup this year like Avril Lavigne, Fishbone, Less Than Jake, Dropkick Murphys, Pennywise and Sublime. You've also got dozens of baby bands and newcomers scheduled to play. How do you strike the right balance between old and new? Every band you book, no matter how big, makes up part of your ticket price, and you always have a few that are reliable and a few that are more of a gamble. Are they going to be bigger than what we paid them? Can the $5,000 band generate $25,000 in value from fans who are excited to see them? If you look at our social media right now, we really don't need to push Sublime or Rise Against. We want to grab onto those younger acts like LØLØ or Honey Revenge and really boost them on our social media so they have a big audience at Warped Tour. I think we waste so much time arguing over font size on the poster when we should be marketing to fans and getting behind the show. People will come and find the bands they want to see. If you could put Korn in the bottom corner of a festival lineup, people would find them and be excited about them. How do you keep egos in check with the schedule? I go to too many festivals where people come in at sunset and miss all the great young bands. And they're going to figure out the lineup. And I think everything we're doing so far is working. Hopefully, we deliver the show that people will want to come see next year. I want to really go see what the first show is like in D.C. before we make any final decisions on that. I want to go see the audience and who's coming. My guess is that it will be a blend of both, but we'll see. I can't do that to myself, hitting the road for two months straight. I've had seven different surgeries because of the Warped Tour. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Talks for who'll wind up with the much-prized Texas Chainsaw Massacre IP are beginning Monday as anywhere from five to eight studios and/or streamers are vying for the rights of the Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel created property which canvases film, TV, live events and games. Exurbia Films is the primary production company behind Texas Chainsaw Massacre with Pat Cassidy, Ian Henkel and Kim Henkel as producers. The property is repped by attorney Marios Rush. There are no clear frontrunners, however, new creative parties have emerged with a passion for the project. Myriad notable creative entities have teamed up with studios to pitch Verve and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre rights holders on their vision for notorious killer Leatherface, who uses his chainsaw to go on a cannibalistic killing spree. Since we first told you about the project, Taylor Sheridan's name has gained steam as having interest in the property. No surprise that he's interested as Sheridan was raised in Texas. In regards to the Oz Perkins' version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, we understand the Longlegs filmmaker would only produce and co-write with Bryan Bertino. Jordan Peele's Monkeypaw is another new party to emerge with an eye on Texas Chainsaw Massacre, also in producing capacity. We understand that's a TV a pitch aligned with A24, and will have Austin, TX native Glen Powell involved, but not starring. Separately, Lee has a feature film pitch for Texas Chainsaw Massacre which would be set up at Netflix. The original 1974 movie was made for $140K and distributed Bryanston Distributing Company, famed for its theatrical release of 1972 X-rated title Deep Throat. In 1983, New Line Cinema acquired distribution rights with the entire franchise via nine movies grossing north of $252M worldwide There also comics, a novel and two video game adaptations. New Line launched a prolific 2003 remake directed by German filmmaker Marcus Nispel with Michael Bay producing and pre-Quiet Place Andrew Form and Brad Fuller executive producing. Starring Jessica Biel just as she was segueing from 7th Heaven to feature films, that title remains the highest-grossing in the 51-year old franchise at $107M. Classic horror franchises, rebooted after several years laid dormant, are a big a business, especially when left in the hands of passionate auteurs, i.e. Scream VI under the direction of Radio Silence opened to a series best at the domestic box office with $44.4M (and $108M domestic), ditto for 2018's Halloween which saw the return of Jamie Lee Curtis under the direction of David Gordon Green; that pic opening to a franchise high of $76.2M (and ending its domestic at $159.3M). Recently, Final Destination: Bloodlines, the first sequel in 14 years in the New Line 25-year old series, opened to a franchise high of $51.6M and quickly became the highest installment in a six film series with a current running global take of $235M.

Summer doesn't technically start until June 20 this year, but already its season of new movies is in full swing. Earlier this week, journalists caught the first IMAX preview screening of Joseph Kosinski's racing drama “F1” — starring Brad Pitt, who does his own driving, and in theaters from Warner Bros. June 27 before streaming later on Apple TV+. The purported $300-million movie also stars “Snowfall” breakout Damson Idris as Pitt's rookie prodigy, plus Javier Bardem, Kerry Condon, Tobias Menzies, and Shea Whigham.

Meanwhile, she's reconnected with her ex-boyfriend, a middling New York theater actor and cater-waiter played by Chris Evans in one of his most compelling performances. Anne argues that “Materialists” — far less fizzy than its marketing would have you believe, including a subplot involving Johnson's desperately single client played by “Succession” star Zoë Winters — doesn't satisfy as a romance. Ryan is more taken by the film, which at times fascinatingly feels like an ethnographic study of how a romantic comedy or drama moves, operates, and behaves. Where Anne and Ryan really disagree is in the commercial potential of “Materialists”; Anne sees the film as a box-office, audience-pleasing play, while Ryan attests that the film is darker, more cynical, and even at times weirder than the more conventionally minded movie it may appear to be on its surface. In this week's episode, we also take a look at the ongoing Tribeca Festival in New York City, where Ryan has already seen a few standout titles on the ground. Plus, we debate whether exhibitors and theater owners should be allowed to join The Academy, as recently posited by Clayton Davis in a Variety piece. It's a long road to creating another branch anyway, as The Academy has only just made way for stunt and casting kudos.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Unfortunately, Anna's daughter (Julia Butters) and Anna's husband-to-be Eric's (Manny Jacinto) daughter do not get along, as evidenced in Anna's daughter writing her mock vows and calling Lily Davies “a little demon thing with an obnoxious accent.” Flash forward from a fortune teller (Vanessa Bayer) incident on Anna's bachelorette where Bayer assesses that Butters' and Sophia Hammons' step sisters to be “are called to be family” and tells Anna and Tess that they may learn another lesson from “walking in each other's paths,” the lightning that does strike them twice puts them all in a quartet body swap situation. “Change the hearts you know are wrong,” Bayer's voice says. Chaos ensues as the four realize that Anna and her daughter have swapped bodies while Tess, aka grandma, and Lily have swapped bodies.

Twenty-two years after the premiere of Freaky Friday, Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan have reunited as mother-daughter, reprising their roles as Tess and Anna Coleman, respectively, in the sequel Freakier Friday.

And of course Chad Michael Murray, returning to reprise his role of Jake, rolls up on a motor cycle in the end of the clip to make a “grand, sexy entrance.” No sign of Manny Jacinto, who will play Lindsay Lohan's character's husband, or Never Have I Ever breakout Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, but eagle-eyed fans have spotted Elaine Hendrix, one of Lohan's costars from The Parent Trap (1998) in a brief scene.

Talking to Ridley Scott feels a bit like it must have been to watch gladiator matches in the Roman Colosseum: You never quite know what to expect, but it's guaranteed to be an exciting ride. He's been knighted, nominated for four Oscars, and his films have grossed more than $5 billion worldwide. Even if he wasn't 87 years old and 30 films into an almost 50-year career, Scott has earned the right to talk about what he likes. On a recent Sunday morning, the subject was his 2005 film “Kingdom of Heaven,” which now receives a limited re-release in theaters and a spanking-new 4K transfer on home video. Starring Orlando Bloom, Eva Green, Jeremy Irons, David Thewlis, Brendan Gleeson, and Edward Norton, the original “Kingdom of Heaven” grossed $218 million worldwide up against a $130 million budget and mixed reviews. At the time an underwhelming period follow-up from the man who previously directed Best Picture winner “Gladiator,” its director's-cut version has earned a reputation as one of Scott's best films. Yet 20 years later, he's as eager to digress from his intended path as to luxuriate in a well-earned victory lap. Related Stories Does ‘Materialists' Satisfy as a Romance? Screen Talk Debates Celine Song's Film, Shares ‘F1' First Reactions ‘I Don't Understand You' Review: Nick Kroll and Andrew Rannells Kill It in Grisly Destination Rom-Com Speaking recently to IndieWire, Ridley Scott looked back at “Kingdom of Heaven” and its unconventional approach to exploring the twin histories of Christianity and Islam in a post-9/11 cinematic landscape. In addition to comparing it to the red-meat satisfaction of “Gladiator,” Scott recalled the process of casting Edward Norton as leprosy-stricken King Balthazar without giving him credit, discussed the inspirations of David Lean and John Ford's “The Searchers,” and revealed the one script in his war chest of unrealized projects that he's still desperate to make. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. IndieWire: As the man who popularized director's cuts with “Blade Runner,” where does this film rank for you in terms of Hollywood's mistreatment of your work? Ridley Scott: You could write a book about that, dude — and that would be Chapter One only. The problem is it is a constant aggressive dance between commerce against art, and each side has the right to have an opinion. If somebody's giving me a million dollars to fuck around and make my movie, he has a right to have some opinion. If somebody's giving me $200 million, he has every right to have a fucking opinion. but I'd probably done 2,000 or 3,000 commercials as a filmmaker and operator, and I was very, very successful where we had offices in Paris, London, New York, and L.A. I'm walking in with “The Duellists,” which won [best debut film] at Cannes. They [didn't] know what to do with it, so they made seven prints for America. My first film is “Duellists,” my second film is “Alien,” third one is “Blade Runner,” the fourth film is “Legend.” And at the end of all that, because none of them quite worked except for “Alien,” one of them said, “Have you ever thought making a film about normal people?” I thought, maybe they're right. So then there was a very little, really great film called “Someone to Watch Over Me.” You had been intrigued by the Crusades for a really long time, but “Kingdom of Heaven” feels heavily filtered through a more secular, contemporary perspective. How intentional was that as you and William Monahan began to put this together? Bill's writing is so persuasive that I didn't fully recognize, even though 9/11 had just happened, what thin ice we were walking on. Also, Bill's coming at it from a reverse point of view that the infidel[s] — us — are the assholes, and we are invading a place where we shouldn't even be. Doesn't that echo many cases today? We're not going to go there, but it fucking does. On top of that, the King of Morocco asked to see me, and so I go to his court, he sits down, has a cigarette, and we chat. I've [now] done five things in Morocco. Was this film always meant to be a slightly more subdued or slower-burn kind of story than something soapier and more conventionally crowd-pleasing like “Gladiator”? Listen, crowd-pleasing is a billion dollars, dude. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that, because we are in the business of entertainment. If not, you shouldn't be doing it. In Rome, they still celebrate “Gladiator” by running the Coliseum once a year. And then “Kingdom of Heaven” was the most popular film in Egypt, and I think it's partly because when the film was put out 20 years ago, it seems to be about religion and the conflict of that. I think a certain kind of audience will simply not go and sit because they're not interested. So my feeling is that because of the platform [of home video], “Kingdom of Heaven” is there all the time, every night globally and people got to sit and go, “Wow, that's good.” And so off that, Fox now has had a very, very good 20 year run with it. And that's why they came back and said, “I want to put it out in 500 theaters in 4K. Are you up for it?” I said, “Of course.” Now, I've had many journalists who say they're experts, and they said, “But this was not like that… and that was not like that.” And my question to them was, “Were you there?” And they said, “No.” So I said, “Well, shut the fuck up. There's this incredible silent weapon in this film with Edward Norton as the masked King Baldwin. Was he always meant to be uncredited? I said, “Ed, are you sure you want to do this?” He said, “Yes, I don't give a fuck. I want to be in the movie.” He said, “And don't credit me because I'm not there. But [as an actor,] I want to experience the film.” And that was it. And I got lucky because I met [Ghassan Massoud,] who was really a very strong Muslim actor who played Saladin so well and so sympathetically — fundamentally based on actual history. Then when he insisted people had to leave Jerusalem, and without [violence], his fervent guys with behind him said, “There has to be blood.” He said, “No, there has to be tax.” They settled for the tax to leave. Were there other details that you faced hurdles in trying to include? Bill wrote a character I can only describe within his Muslim faith as a fundamentalist who was constantly contradicting Saladin. You should have done that.” And then Saladin would come back; he gives an answer which cuts his balls off. Every faith has fundamentalism, so we included those extremities, and the guy who played the extremist was fucking great as well. With [King Baldwin,] I used to live in a house from 1360. It was lit with candles — nuts, right? In the recorded history, it was purported that Sibylla's child had passed at about 13 or 14. It also suggested that the child may have had leprosy, and therefore, she could not bear to see her child go through what her brother would go through with an incurable disease. [Eva Green] never forgave me for cutting that 17 minutes. When you're making a film like this, do you have a moment where you're like, “I don't mind stealing that shot of Peter O'Toole atop a sand dune?” Or, say, borrow a classic “Searchers” shot — those classic film tropes — when you're coming up with shots? They're Navajo, so it was all wrong. And not only that, it jumped onto the first idea that many women who had experienced life with a tribe never wanted to come back. So [John Ford] even dared to do that with Natalie Wood. But David Lean, I have great admiration for everything he did. One day I actually had lunch with him. I was making “Legend” with a 21-year-old Tom Cruise in Pinewood. I've got my massive forest on the Bond stage, and David walked in saying, “Who the is this madman building this fucking forest?” So he said, “You want to have lunch?” So I had lunch with David Lean. And he was great, very elegant man. Not just with this release, but in the 20 years since it was released, do you feel like “Kingdom of Heaven” has truly been vindicated? People sit and watch this who'd never normally watch it, so thank you for streaming — otherwise, it would be lying on a fucking shelf in some vault somewhere for 20 years. “The Duellists” runs every night on Netflix. So thank God when people say, “What the fuck is that?” and click. And in “The Duellists” you'll learn a little bit about Napoleon, right? You know, but I loved doing “Matchstick Men,” which is comically funny. Looking at your filmography, there are dozens of projects that came and went. “Tripoli” was the film that led to “Kingdom of Heaven.” Is there one among those unrealized projects that you haven't been able to do that still kind of haunts you? There's always a time that they can be done. I own a Western, which is the best Western I've read, which was written 1980 by a very good writer who passed away in COVID. I mean, that's not my kind of Western. Is that a Cormac McCarthy adaptation, or something else? No, I did one thing with Cormac McCarthy, which I think is one of my best films, but it's too dark. It's called “The Counselor.” If you are a writer, I think it might appeal because the dialogue of Cormac is phenomenal, and I fell in love with it. Thank you so much for your time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. The most beautiful and dangerous thing about parent-child relationships is that they're always changing, even as the love that holds them in place never does. It's beautiful, of course, that newly widowed horse mom Kate (Julianne Moore) would still do anything for her precious Claire (Sydney Sweeney, raw enough to plow through some very goofy dialogue), even though the once-adoring little girl has matured into a shrieky, manipulative drug addict who now sees her mom as a hindrance to scoring heroin. The danger there, as we see over the course of Michael Pearce's luridly enjoyable “Echo Valley,” is that doing “anything” for her full-grown junkie daughter requires a very different kind of commitment from Kate than it did when Claire was a kid. Back in the day it probably just meant buying her a pony for their farm. Now it means dumping her boyfriend's dead body in the nearest lake so that Claire won't go to jail for “accidentally” bashing his brains in with a rock. Screen Talk Debates Celine Song's Film, Shares ‘F1' First Reactions ‘I Don't Understand You' Review: Nick Kroll and Andrew Rannells Kill It in Grisly Destination Rom-Com Scripted by “Mare of Easttown” writer Brad Ingelsby, and soaked in a similar fear of white suburban rot, this protean Apple TV+ thriller works best when it operates by the same principle. The first half of the film seems to shift into a different genre every few minutes; what starts as a chilly grief drama about a depressed New Jersey lesbian who can't pay her farm bills — to the great annoyance of her rich landowner ex-husband, played by a fiery Kyle MacLachlan in a one-scene cameo that feels like an unresolved parenthetical — sours into a Cassavetes-loud heartwrencher when Claire shows up at her mother's door in desperate need of help. But that vibe — and the domestic violence that comes with it — lasts just long enough to set up a very different sort of movie. You see, Claire thought it would be funny to throw her “fuckface” boyfriend's stuff off a local bridge, but she failed to realize that $10,000 of his dealer's heroin was bundled up inside of it. Now the couple has to come up with the money themselves, or Jackie is going to kill them both (he's played by a scummy as hell Domhnall Gleeson, who predictably delights in a role that allows him to subvert the inherent kindness of his demeanor). And as if that weren't bad enough, the stakes get raised even higher when Claire returns to the horse farm a few days later covered in her boyfriend's blood and crying for her mommy. Moore has always displayed a rare gift for revealing her characters' inner strength by allowing us to watch them unravel (see: the pharmacy scene in “Magnolia”), and she conveys so much about the ineffable weight of motherhood through Kate's wounded but unflinching reaction to the crisis that Claire lays at her feet. No joke: There was a brief stretch of this story where I thought it might turn out that Kate used to kill people for a living, but “retired assassin forced back into the game” is one of the few sub-genres that “Echo Valley” doesn't entertain. “It must be fucking awful having a kid like that,” Jackie snarls to her at one point. “Always having to clean up their shit.” But a sociopath like him could never understand that “having to clean up someone's shit” can be the most affirming obligation this world has to offer, even if that shit is a lot messier than any parent would ever want for their child. That's why “Echo Valley” is at its richest and most self-possessed during the fleeting moments when it seems like dumping a body at the bottom of a lake might be the magic bullet that brings these two women back together again. Alas, Pearce (“Beast,” “Encounter”) does better with ambivalent threats than he does with emotional openness, and Ingelsby's script is too eager to shift into yet another different gear for “Echo Valley” to kindle any lasting warmth from its mother-daughter murder duo. There's some fun to be had in watching “Echo Valley” shift into a battle of wits between Moore and Gleeson, as both actors mine devious nuance from the thin gruel of a paperback thriller (though I was just as amused by the movie's growing reliance on Apple software, and by whatever corporate machinations led to Verizon getting a shoutout instead of AT&T). But “Echo Valley” loses its reason for being as soon as its self-impressed third act decides to focus on Kate's resourcefulness at the expense of her emotional responsibility. Without that unconditional love to hold it together, this movie's volatile changes can't help but obscure the essence of a story about what it really means for some things to always stay the same.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Billy Joel reveals that he twice attempted suicide — sparked by his affair with a band mate's wife — in his new HBO documentary And So It Goes, and that one of the attempts left him in a coma. Before he was “The Piano Man,” a twentysomething Joel played in a Long Island hard rock band called Attila alongside his then-best friend Jon Small. At one point, Joel moved in with Small, his wife Elizabeth Weber, and their young son, during which Joel and Weber spent “a lot of time together” and a “slow build” romance developed. Joel eventually admitted to Small, “I'm in love with your wife.” I felt like a homewrecker,” Joel said in the documentary, according to People. The affair resulted in Attila's breakup, the (temporary) end of his best friendship, and Joel getting evicted from Small's house. Joel's sister Judy, then a medical assistant, had previously prescribed her brother sleeping pills to help him sleep; Joel's first suicide attempt came when he “decided that he was going to take them all.” “I went to go see him in the hospital, and he was lying there white as a sheet. Joel, disappointed that his attempt failed, woke up in the hospital and swore to do it “right” the second time. He said he drank an entire bottle of the cleaning product “lemon Pledge,” after which his ex-best friend, Small, took him to the hospital. “Even though our friendship was blowing up, Jon saved my life,” Joel said. Small added in the documentary, “He never really said anything to me, the only practical answer I can give as to why Billy took it so hard was because he loved me that much and that it killed him to hurt me that much. Following that attempt, Joel entered himself into an observation ward for a few weeks, a decision that changed the trajectory of his life. “I got out of the observation ward, and I thought to myself, you can utilize all those emotions to channel that stuff into music,” Joel said. Being Stray Kids Takes a Lot of Work — and Close Friendships Inside the Billion-Dollar Effort to Make Trump Feel Good About Himself And So It Goes premiered Wednesday at the Tribeca Film Festival, with Joel unable to attend the screening due to his recent brain disorder diagnosis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Back in 2017, Swift was sued by the songwriters behind 3LW's “Playas Gon' Play” for using the lyrics “players gonna play, haters gonna hate” in her hit “Shake It Off.” The lawsuit sparked a years-long legal battle that was ultimately voluntarily dismissed in late 2022. And two weeks later, I got served by the people that were suing her!” Specifically, Swift had said she had “heard the phrases ‘players gonna play' and ‘haters gonna hate' uttered countless times to express the idea that one should shrug off negativity,” and had referred to the Church track. “I sent her a text, and she responded,” Church recounted. He added, about his own case: “It's since been settled. But I was like, ‘How did this even happen?

Church, meanwhile, is currently performing around Nashville during CMA Fest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Daron Malakian has strong opinions about what's missing in heavy music today: danger and risk. “I think you have a generation of fans who are very easily offended,” he tells Rolling Stone. “Offensiveness and shock should not be taken away from rock music in general.” “Insanity/Controlling me,” he sings in the song's chorus, “Society/The kids are on a killing spree.” Built on manic, strobing guitars and undulating waves of distortion, the music feels both cutting and brutalizing. “It's gonna feel like a Jesus comin' back,” he sings, stretching the last word heavenward with giddy, helium-like aplomb. “I think the song ‘Killing Spree' is a subject that I don't think a lot of people want to touch,” Malakian, 49, says via email. He's reluctant to explain the song — “Your kids are on a killing spree, so your kids have something to do with it,” he says vaguely — partially because he doesn't see anything controversial about the subject matter of killing sprees. “We live in a world, and things happen in this world, and killing sprees are one of those things that I've seen happen kind of often in the last 15 years or so — but I actually wrote the song way before that,” he says. Moreover, he looks at the song as commentary more than a transgressive statement. These days, Malakian says he just writes songs for the sake of it. As guitarist-singer for System of a Down, he's been keeping busy touring with them. That album contained songs he had once hoped to record with System of a Down; Addicted to the Violence, he says, is more general. Malakian had recorded Dictator as a distraction from “some personal things going on with my family and my life,” so he recorded a bunch of songs in the space of two weeks, doing everything himself, from the vocals and guitars to the drums. Addicted to the Violence has been a more considered affair that found him collaborating on songwriting with his friend, multi-instrumentalist Orbel Babayan, drummer Roman Lomtadze, and saxophonist Matthew “Narducci” Silberman. “On this one, I did more home demos, recorded some stuff at home, picked the songs in my rolodex of songs that were like, ‘Let's record this one, see how it goes. Addison Rae's Pop Queen Dreams Are Massive, and Just Out of Reach Talking Heads Celebrate 50th Anniversary With ‘Psycho Killer' Video Starring Saoirse Ronan Inside the Billion-Dollar Effort to Make Trump Feel Good About Himself Scars on Broadway first recorded the songs at Malakian's home, but it didn't sound right, so they went to a studio, recutting everything but the vocals. So will people be able to hear these songs in a concert setting? Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After getting serious on Sincere, Khalid is ready to have fun again. Hearing his songs on the app, Khalid finds himself in an earlier era. Last February, the Billboard Hot 100-topping R&B and pop artist noticed one of his early hits was resurfacing. 16 in 2017 — was connecting with listeners all over again, who were singing along to the yearning lyrics about love in the digital age with a fresh perspective. “It's a whole new society, a whole new age of young adults who are experiencing this song,” Khalid says. It makes me live vicariously through that experience. I'm like, wow, there's a reason why it resonates with them: because that was real.” When he first wrote the song, Khalid was a teenager himself. “Turning 27 this year came with a lot of reflection on life,” he says. And if you had told him all of [what would happen in the next 10 years]?” he says with a chuckle. Now fully cemented as an in-demand collaborator, global arena artist and reliably charting hit-maker, Khalid is ready to rediscover the innocent version of himself that he was before he found success. He wants to be the most open and honest version of himself — not necessarily the serious and emotional version  Khalid spent years of his life pouring into 2024's Sincere, but one that is able to relax because he has fully embraced his own identity. Though it's not how he wanted to share that part of his identity with his fans, with a simple rainbow emoji he confirmed that he is gay and “not ashamed of [his] sexuality. “Everybody is singing them the same way they were before I was outed! I think they care about our mutual respect for music.” It was a liberating experience, he says, seeing that very little had changed. “That doesn't change because the world finds out I'm gay. Once they're out in the world, fans can project their own feelings and experiences onto them. After he came out, a fan pointed out that his 2022 song “Satellite” was already “an LGBTQ anthem.” In addition, “Better” has been used as a first dance at multiple weddings, and the 2017 song “Young Dumb & Broke” has become a staple at graduations. As listeners find meaning in the music, it takes on its own dimensions. There's so much emotion involved in the exchange of music from artists to listeners.” “ ‘Young Dumb & Broke' lasting as long as it has now would have never been anything I imagined, because when I made that song, I was so presently focused on being young, dumb and broke,” he says. Khalid says he wants to inspire young Black men to be comfortable being open about their sexuality, but he doesn't see the music as appealing to any specific kind of listener because of the identity of the person making it. “If you place yourself in an experience, we can relate to people all across the board. Khalid is a major star of the streaming era. He has multiple songs in Spotify's Billions Club (tracks with 1 billion streams), including “Location,” “Young Dumb & Broke” and “Lovely,” his collaboration with Billie Eilish. When he first started, though, those platforms were barely on his radar. Instead, he uploaded his first songs to SoundCloud, the streaming site where users once shared their own music and mixtapes — a popular platform for new musicians. There was very little thought to strategy or rollout. “Naturally, that led to other apps like YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music and so on. “I remember being on the phone with a friend, like, ‘I'm about to upload my song to the internet.' It felt so carefree back then — just making songs with my friends and throwing them online. Nobody could have imagined what streaming would become today.” Though he couldn't have predicted it, Khalid was uniquely positioned for the streaming era. He's often categorized as an R&B singer, but he has a genre fluidity that has landed him on a diverse number of Billboard charts: Adult Contemporary, Latin, Rock & Alternative, Rap, Dance. As a child, Khalid's parents were in the Army and he often found himself moving around. He spent six years living in Germany when he was young, then spent some of his formative teen years from eighth grade until just before his senior year in upstate New York, just 20 minutes from the Canadian border. “When I was in northern New York, I got introduced to American folk music, which became a big part of my foundation as an artist and really shaped my songwriting. Then living in Germany exposed me to pop music from a different perspective. And coming from the South, R&B is definitely at my core. So all these different shades of music come together to make who I am.” He'd moved to El Paso by the time he released his breakout 2017 debut album, American Teen, but it was inspired by his experiences growing up both there and at Fort Drum, just outside of Watertown, N.Y. Like so many other teenagers growing up outside of a major city, he spent a lot of time bored or partying — and dabbling in music. “A lot of the stories that ended up inspiring American Teen came from that time in my life,” he recalls. “It was cold and kind of bleak, with not a whole lot to do — but there were definitely a lot of parties. Looking back now as an adult, I'm like, ‘Why did you get yourself into some of those situations?' But honestly, it was the perfect setting for teenage angst — just growing up, facing challenges and mentally taking notes.” His mother was restationed to El Paso before his senior year of high school, and he decided to go with her. At the time, Right Hand Co.'s Courtney Stewart was managing a number of producers when he was introduced to Khalid through mutual friends on Twitter and heard some of his SoundCloud demos. “He didn't know it at the time, but he was writing a generational album in American Teen,” Stewart says. It was something I had never heard before. Other artists and producers have heard the same thing in his music. He's collaborated with a number of Canadian artists, including Majid Jordan, Tate McRae, Shawn Mendes, Alessia Cara and Justin Bieber. Khalid says he loves collaborating, which brings the best attributes of two sounds together. Having another voice in the room can also let him get out of his own head, he says, and recognize when a song is a hit. “I think not losing sight and just trusting my voice has led me to be in any sound comfortably because I get to pull up as myself,” he says. I made that album only to go into hiding afterward. I don't feel like that's very much freedom. Embracing his full self has brought him back to the carefree headspace of his SoundCloud days — but with the experience and maturity of an established music career. “I had my fair share of time to be serious. Now I don't have a care in the world. In a recently posted TikTok clip, Khalid is vibing to a snippet of an unreleased song on the streets of Manhattan. It takes only 15 seconds to see the comfort and excitement of his new chapter. “My new era of music feels like I'm finally ready to be the artist I've always dreamt of being,” he says. “It goes back to the regressions of when I was a child — imagining myself and thinking, ‘I want to be this artist one day.'

In a new Instagram post, the Jungle Cruise star and girl dad shared how his Samoan grandfather, High Chief Peter Maivia, “epitomized true masculinity and ‘self care' before self care became a popular term,” he wrote. “[He] was a big influence on me, respected everywhere he went and knew how to take care of himself, and he was also the inspiration behind my character Maui from Moana,” Johnson explains in the video, which also coincides with Papatui's debut in Walmart stores and online.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Adam David won season 27 of “The Voice” in May 2025, he knew it would not be the last time he saw his coach, Michael Bublé. Although many contestants never see the celebrity coaches they worked with on the show once their season is over, Bublé promised his back-to-back winners — David and season 26's Sofronio Vasquez — he would continue to be their coach and friend long after the show was over. Both singers have said the superstar is keeping his word. The two reunited on May 7, when Vasquez shared two Instagram posts showing them together in Los Angeles and captioned their joyful selfies by writing, “had a very productive lunch with the man himself @michaelbuble. Vasquez told WKTV in Utica that Bublé has been instrumental in his success since the show, sharing that the Grammy winner “managed to pull in people that he worked with before—like writers, musical producers. And some of the songs that he has written have not been recorded, or he's written new songs just for me.” Bublé has also made it possible for Vasquez to perform for and with major celebrities, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates in March, when he attended prolific producer David Foster's birthday party for his wife, Katharine McPhee. Meanwhile, Bublé has also said he plans to be part of David's life and career, too. Right after David won season 27, the Grammy winner told People that he was so excited, he probably wouldn't be able to sleep that night. This is personal for me because honestly, when the cameras shut off, we're friends. Not all of our conversations are music, which is amazing.” On May 22, David told Good Housekeeping that he'd already had talks with both his coach and Vasquez about possible collaborations. “Obviously, I want to continue growing my relationship with Michael,” he told the outlet.</p>

Past “RHOC” star Gretchen Rossi is returning as a friend-of. “There's a snake in the group,” Beador is heard saying. It's unclear who they're talking about, the trailer also shows some lighthearted moments from the cast's New Orleans and Amsterdam trip. Fans are also looking forward to Rossi's return after her departure following season 8. “Tamra and Gretchen's feud back on screen is a dream come true, now that is an insane old school rivalry. Inject this into my veins!” a fan wrote on X. Drama between Judge and Pedranti is also revisited from season 18, and it looks like the former Cut Fitness owner also gets into it with Beador. A few “RHOC” season 19 cast members are already fan-faves and one wrote, “Clocking in to defend Jenn & Gretchen all season!! After Rossi's long hiatus from “RHOC,” Beador is happy to have her on board. “She's been nothing but sweet to me, so I think she's going to be a good addition,” Beador added. Beador continued, “We're just finished week three — and the drama's already starting.” “Thankfully, we don't really live in the same community, so I don't have to run into her or anything like that,” she said. The mom of one stated, “I really don't hold grudges, whatever, [let] bygones be bygones, I'm in such a better place in my life than I was dealing with all that on ‘Housewives.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rumors continue to swirl about her connection to Joe D'Amelio, especially now that DeSorbo has officially announced her exit from “Summer House” after seven seasons. Following her late 2024 breakup with “Southern Charm” star Craig Conover, Paige DeSorbo insists she is currently single. However, her fans and Bravo gossip accounts aren't so sure. Clues continue to surface suggesting that DeSorbo is dating businessman Joe D'Amelio. Celebrity gossip outlet Deux Moi posted an image that reportedly shows the two walking hand-in-hand during Super Bowl weekend. “Steph With Da Deets” also highlighted that the mystery man with DeSorbo wore the same watch and shoes as D'Amelio and that his tattoos match those seen in other photos. Meanwhile, “Xoxo Bravo Girl” shared a post of flowers that appeared in DeSorbo's Instagram story—with what looked like part of D'Amelio's tattooed arm also visible. The fan account commented, “If these flowers were from her parents or a friend she would've said so, I'm sure.” DeSorbo recently told People, “I'm definitely not jumping into anything serious right now. Deux Moi reported that DeSorbo was “spotted getting cozy with her rumored friend,” while Enty Lawyer teased that a certain reality star (believed to be DeSorbo) was trying to quietly manage a new relationship. Fans have also noticed her purse in a selfie posted by D'Amelio, as well as what appear to be matching hotel room photos shared by both. “I have a little life update for you: I've made the decision not to return to ‘Summer House,'” DeSorbo shared via Instagram Stories on June 5. “You've seen me grow up over these last seven summers,” she reflected. The 32-year-old added, “But like all good things (and some bad decisions), it's time for this chapter to close.” She also promised fans: “You haven't seen the last of me, I promise. As for rumors that DeSorbo might join “The Real Housewives of New York City,” she recently told Glamour, “Housewives is such an established franchise, I think it would be very hard for me to assimilate. “My thought is she doesn't want her single love life played out on camera,” one source shared. Do you think Paige DeSorbo and Joe D'Amelio are still an item?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A woman federal prosecutors are calling a victim of Sean “Diddy” Combs took the stand at his federal trial in lower Manhattan on Thursday, telling the court that during their three year relationship, which lasted up until his September arrest, 90 percent of their time together was during drug-fueled, days-long “freak-offs” where she was coerced into performing sex acts with male sex workers. Combs has pled not guilty to all charges in the feds' five-count indictment, which includes sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. Diddy Trial Sees Heckler Disrupt Court as Judge Learns Anonymous Witness' Name Leaked Online Taking the stand after court had returned from the day's lunch break, Jane Doe revealed early in her testimony that prior to connecting romantically with Combs in 2021, she was involved with a man with whom Combs has history and a tense relationship. She said she met the rap world icon in Miami at a party she attended with a group of girlfriends, one of whom was casually dating Combs at the time, since his 2018 split with R&B singer Cassie Ventura, the federal prosecutors' star witness. Over her first few hours of testimony Thursday afternoon, Doe painted a picture of the couple's meet-cute and easy segue into a more serious relationship, which grew over phone calls, texts and FaceTime video calls. In fact, their relationship saw a boom when Doe's friend, who was dating Combs, got engaged and moved to Europe. Soon, she told the court, Combs swept her off her feet with a trip to Turks and Caicos and the Bahamas over 15 days. “I really fell head over heels for Sean,” she said, adding that it was OK for her that he was also seeing other people because she really liked him. “I understood that on his end, it was never a monogamous relationship. After Combs' assistants had set up the hotel suite, Doe said, she would dress in racy lingerie and high-heeled shoes. The encounter as described by Doe followed a familiar trajectory, one described by Ventura a few weeks ago when she testified about her “freak-off” experiences: the woman and escort would pour baby oil onto each other's bodies (12 bottles one time, she said); the two begin touching; Doe begins to perform oral sex on Don as Combs watches, masturbating. It just completely set the tone for our relationship moving forward.” When asked to give a percentage figure by federal prosecutors, Doe told the court that after May 2021, 90 percent of the sexual experiences she had with Combs involved other men. “I just wanted to satisfy my partner,” she said of participating in the freak-offs. As their relationship stretched into months, Combs began to give large sums of money to Doe, whose work marketing brands on her social media accounts was dwindling. He handed her $10,000 after their initial trip to Turks and Caicos as she'd missed out on some work while on the trip with him; later, he'd typically give her $5,000 or $6,000 incrementally. An attempt she had planned to earn her own money by launching an Only Fans account, where she would appear in lingerie and bikinis, could have helped out with a sense of independence — as she told Combs, a friend had claimed she'd brought in $4 million in a year doing a Just Fans page. At a point, Doe says, she asked Combs if they could stop doing “freak-offs” altogether. His response, she told the court, was to threaten her livelihood and home. “He would just say things like, ‘If you want to break up, that's fine. You have three months left on the house because I'm not about to be paying rent,'” Jane recalled Combs saying. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>
