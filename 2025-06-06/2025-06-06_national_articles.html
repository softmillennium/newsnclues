A Seattle man died after falling 3,000 feet from a climbing route at Denali National Park in Alaska, the National Park Service said Wednesday. Alex Chiu, 41, was ascending the West Buttress route of Mount McKinley on Monday, June 2, one of the park's most frequently climbed routes, while not attached to a rope, the agency said in a statement. He was ski mountaineering, which involves ascending and descending the route with skis. He was joined by two others in his expedition to conquer North America's highest peak. Two others witnessed his fall onto the rocky face covered in jagged ice, and lowered themselves over the edge as far as they could, but they could not see or hear him after the fall, officials said. The body of a deceased ski mountaineer was recovered on the morning of Wednesday, June 4. Alex Chiu, 41, of Seattle, Washington, died as a result of a 3,000-foot fall from the Mt. Due to high winds and snow, ground and air search teams were unable to quickly reach the area where he had fallen on Monday. On Wednesday, clear weather allowed two rangers to depart Talkeetna, a village south of the mountain, in a helicopter search for Chiu. When his body was found, it was transferred to the state medical examiner, the agency said. Fox News Digital has reached out to the Alaska State Medical Examiner's Office for Chiu's official cause of death. In a diagram, provided by the National Park Service, Alex Chiu's route is mapped out on Mt. Chiu was an aerospace engineer at the Federal Aviation Administration and, before that, a software engineer at Boeing, according to his LinkedIn profile. On his social media accounts, he described himself as a storyteller, traveler, scuba diver, rock climber, alpinist and marathon runner. He wrote on his Instagram account about how living in Seattle allowed him to take his ice-climbing tools to the mountains every weekend. He shared that following the daily grind of his 9-to-5, he would pack up his gear and head to the mountains. "I had become so good at what I did that I started teaching others how to do it, and that was even more fun to teach others how to experience the joy you have in these wild places," he wrote in an Instagram post. I was smart, witty, passionate, and bold." "So tomorrow I am getting on an airplane to Alaska," he wrote in an Instagram post on May 19, "in an attempt to climb the third-highest peak in the world because I don't want to know what happens to a dream deferred." The Alaska Range with Mount McKinley and Wonder Lake with Tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus) in the fall, Denali National Park, Alaska. Chiu is one of several people who have died while climbing Mount McKinley or other areas of Denali National Park. In April 2024, 52-year-old Robbi Mecus, of Keene Valley, New York, fell to his death while climbing an estimated 1,000 feet off Mount Johnson in the national park. That incident involved an unroped French mountaineer, who fell to his death on the Peters Glacier.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The National Hurricane Center is “fully staffed” and any suggestion that the Trump administration fired meteorologists at the National Weather Service is “fake news,” “preposterous and silly,” Commerce Sec. Howard Lutnick testified to Congress this week. The NHC, like many other parts of the NWS, has a staffing shortfall currently, with five vacancies at the center in Miami, including at least four meteorologists. The critical staffing issues — which have meant some forecast offices are no longer monitoring the weather 24/7 or launching twice-daily weather balloons — have raised concerns that forecast accuracy will suffer during this hurricane season. There are no openings on the National Hurricane Center, zero. It is fully staffed,” Lutnick said before a Senate appropriations subcommittee during hearings on the Commerce Department budget on Wednesday. Lutnick claimed again on Thursday the NHC is “fully staffed,” and falsely stated local weather service forecast offices are fully staffed in an appearance before the House Appropriations Committee. “It is fake news and inappropriate to suggest a single meteorologist or hydrologist was fired,” Lutnick said. The Trump administration cut about 100 jobs at the NWS, including meteorologists and hydrologists, according to a fact sheet from Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell's office. Many local NWS offices are so short on meteorologists in the wake of Trump administration firings, buyouts and early retirement incentives that the agency has authorized internal transfers to fill critical gaps, in addition to the 126 new hires. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reiterated Lutnick's claims in a Thursday statement: “The National Hurricane Center is fully staffed to meet the rigorous demands of the hurricane season,” spokesperson Kim Doster said. “Future positions that may be advertised at the NHC will provide additional support and a deeper bench for our ongoing around-the-clock operations.” A Commerce Department spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment. The hurricane center's staff website shows all but one of its vacancies, which include at least one hurricane specialist, one hurricane forecaster and two meteorologist/programmers. One staff member who took an early retirement offer is still listed on the roster, according to an NWS employee familiar with the matter.</p>

This image provided by Penguin Random House LLC, shows the book cover of “Who Is Tibet's Exiled Leader? : The 14th Dalai Lama” (Penguin Random House LLC via AP) Vishavjit Singh, who educates youth about Sikhism through his Captain Sikh America character, poses for a portrait in costume at home, in New York's Harlem neighborhood, Friday, May 30, 2025. This image provided by John Porcellino shows “The Weight of my Bones” by John Porcellino, part of his King-Cat Comics and Stories, his long-running series that reflects the author's Zen practice. This image provided by John Porcellino shows “Non-thinking” by John Porcellino is part of his King-Cat Comics and Stories, a long-running series that reflects the author's Zen practice. Vishavjit Singh looked at the boy who uttered those words, and then he looked at himself — a skinny, bespectacled, turbaned, bearded Sikh in a Captain America suit. “I wasn't offended, because I knew that this kid was going to have this image of me, a Sikh Captain America, forever in his mind,” Singh said. Representation of non-Abrahamic religions and spiritual traditions, particularly in the mainstream comics universe, is minimal. Even when they are portrayed in comics, their presentation, as Singh and others in the field point out, is often inauthentic and sometimes negative. Recently, however, comic book writers and academics who study the intersection of religion and comics observe a renaissance of sorts, which they say is happening because people close to these faith traditions are telling these stories with a reverence and sincerity that resonate with a wider audience. Singh's journey to make that connection began after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, triggered anti-Sikh hate incidents. Having faced hate and exclusion throughout his life, he decided to spread his message of kindness and inclusion by capitalizing on the appeal of comics and superheroes — an area where he found Sikh representation to be “virtually zero.” He suited up as Captain Sikh America in Manhattan for the first time in summer 2013 — one year after a self-proclaimed white supremacist opened fire inside a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, killing six and injuring four others. A couple wanted me to be part of their wedding ceremony. He doesn't speak directly about religion but rather the core values of Sikhism. Marvel's Black Panther heralded better representation for Africana religions in the U.S., according to Yvonne Chireau, a professor of religion at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. For example, one page might talk about the Orishas, divine spirits that play a key role in the Yoruba faith of West Africa, while another might feature Egyptian gods. One of the first superheroes with African religious roots, Chireau said, was Brother Voodoo, created in the 1970s by Marvel publisher Stan Lee, writer Len Wein and artist John Romita. The turn of the last century was a time of revival for Black-centric comics, she said, adding that immigration from African and Caribbean countries, including Haiti, led to increased understanding of religious practices originating in those places. “It's definitely gotten a lot better and much more authentic because the people who are telling these stories care about those religious practices,” she said. Brooklyn-born Haitian American comic book writer Greg Anderson Elysée said he didn't learn about African and Caribbean religious traditions until he was a teenager. Elysée was raised Catholic, but he now considers himself agnostic. Common depictions of African faith as voodoo and witchcraft are colonialist narratives aimed at demonizing Indigenous spiritual practices, he added. When we know who we are — whether you believe in the religion or not — it fills you with joy, a purpose and a sense of being.” Elysée is excited and relieved by the reaction to his work. “While this is entertainment, you also don't want to offend those who believe in it and truly get so much power from it,” he said. Zen Buddhism has informed much of John Porcellino's work. Porcellino was drawn to Buddhism in his 20s after what he describes as a period of intense mental suffering and health problems. As a punk rock fan, Porcellino saw commonalities between punk and Zen because “they are both concerned with the essence of things rather than appearances.” Both are ways of life — simple yet nuanced. He gave the example of a wordless story titled “October,” featured in King-Cat's 30th issue, that shows him as a high school student walking home one night from school. Porcellino views these comics as a healing presence in his life. “They are an important part of my spiritual practice,” he said. Robeson liked the idea of representing a religion and culture that do not get much attention in media. “Children's books are like mirrors and windows for kids,” she said. “It's helpful especially for children of immigrants who don't often see themselves in mainstream literature. At the same time, it also helps kids who are not Asian or Buddhist to learn something about those communities.” Amar Chitra Katha was a comic book company started by the late Anant Pai in Mumbai in 1967 as a way to teach Indian children about their own mythology and culture. Pai was an engineer turned comic books seller who used varied marketing techniques, including walking around with planks, nails and hammers in his bag so he could build shelves for bookstores that refused to display his comics because they lacked shelf space, said Reena I. Puri, the company's managing director and a 35-year veteran of the business. “Most recently we've also portrayed (Indigenous) religions and have gathered folktales relating to these traditions from all over India,” she said. “We've educated ourselves and realized that our ancient texts were not as racist or colorist as we may be today,” she said. British comic book writer Mike Carey is known for his 2000-2006 DC Comics series “Lucifer,” which depicts the titular character's adventures on Earth, in Heaven and in various realms after abandoning Hell. Carey counts himself an atheist who went to Sunday school only “for the fun, stories and chocolate.” Carey delved into the concepts of faith, God and morality in a series titled “My Faith in Frankie,” which tells the story of a teenager with a personal god called Jeriven who gets jealous of her boyfriend. Even though many of his comics and novels explore religion and ethics, Carey said, he has never “felt any temptation whatsoever to believe.” “I've become more and more entrenched in that position, because organized religions are like any organization that sustain themselves, amass power, wealth and authority,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The most powerful alliance in US politics crumbled in real-time on Thursday, with President Donald Trump and Elon Musk lobbing political barbs and personal insults at each other from their respective social media platforms. Greg Gutfeld demanded the pair “knock it off” and make up. Don't “sabotage” a Trump “Golden Age,” he said, “with this self-inflicted feud.” Longtime Trump ally and personal friend Laura Ingraham exhorted Musk, whom she called a modern-day Thomas Edison, to see that “Trump is not the problem here.” She confessed the situation “makes me sad,” and solemnly claimed she “talked to an insider today who said it is irreparable.” Other Fox News personalities seemed to deny the severity of the two most powerful figures in conservative politics publicly calling each other liars, losers and worse. “There is no split,” declared “Fox & Friends” co-host Lawrence Jones on Friday morning. “They're going to bury the hatchet.” He added: “You've got two strong alpha males that are deep in their convictions and it just exploded online.” Primetime host Jesse Watters suggested Trump and Musk were “just blowing off steam” and likened the situation to buddies in a love triangle: “Guys sometimes will punch you in the face, and the next night you're having beer; sleep with your girlfriend, and you patch things up.” “Everyone's been in a relationship where in the very beginning you're crazy about each other, you're talking marriage, you're talking about meeting the family, and then all of a sudden it takes a turn and you don't like each other anymore.” Related article The ugliest things Trump and Musk just said about one another Surprisingly, the network hasn't shied away from repeating Musk's allegation that Trump is mentioned in the so-called Epstein files, long a subject of right-wing conspiracy theories. Trump “was one of the first people to realize just how horrible Epstein really was,” Hannity offered in a defense. “﻿What are you doing?” However, Kilmeade was careful to praise Musk's efforts during his time in the Trump administration. Notably, none of Fox's MAGA-aligned opinion stars explicitly chose a side, instead choosing to believe this is a mere blip in their big, beautiful friendship. It will be interesting to see where they fall should things get even uglier. US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy breaks down the growing rift between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk as the two trade public jabs, including threats to cut government contracts. FIRST ON FOX: The chairman of the House Budget Committee is pushing back on Elon Musk's claim that President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill" is full of "pork." Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, told Fox News Digital it was not possible for "pork barrel spending" to be included in the legislation, called a budget reconciliation bill, because the reconciliation process was simply not the mechanism for such federal funds. "Reconciliation does not have anything to do with discretionary spending - earmarks, and all of that," Arrington said. "And quite frankly, the [Department of Government Efficiency] findings were, I think, almost entirely an issue for . "Discretionary spending" refers to the annual dollars allocated by Congress each year through the appropriations process – also known as "spending bills." President Donald Trump said he was "disappointed" with Elon Musk after the billionaire criticized the Big Beautiful Bill. It's a process that's historically known to be rife with "pork barrel spending" from both Republicans and Democrats – funding for pet projects or other specific initiatives benefiting a certain member of Congress' district. But reconciliation deals with the government's "mandatory spending" – largely government welfare programs that can only be amended by changing the law. "We're dealing with mandatory spending programs – entitlements, health care, welfare and the tax code," Arrington said. The question, I think, for some folks and the objective of mine and my budget committee members was, whatever we're doing on tax or security to unleash growth and to buy greater security for the American people, we wanted it to be done in a fiscally responsible way." Senior White House adviser Stephen Miller echoed that sentiment on X: "The reconciliation bill cuts taxes, seals the border and reforms welfare. House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington said that lawmakers did not put "pork" in a reconciliation bill. The vast majority of the trillions of dollars in the bill are aimed at Trump's tax policies – extending his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) while implementing new priorities like eliminating taxes on tips and overtime wages. The legislation is also aimed at amending current laws to enable new funding for border security and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) – projected to boost those priorities by billions of dollars. To offset those costs, House GOP leaders are seeking stricter work requirements for Medicaid and food stamps, while shifting more of the cost burden for both programs to the states. Republicans are also looking to roll back green energy tax subsidies in former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). But Musk and other fiscal hawks' main concern has been that the legislation does not go far enough with those spending cuts. They've also raised concerns about the overall bill adding to the national debt – which is currently nearing $37 trillion. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller also argued that reconciliation bills couldn't include "pork." Musk reposted another X user who wrote, "Drop the tax cuts, cut some pork, get the bill through." He's also shown support on X for Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and his call to strip the debt limit provision out of the bill. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has projected that the bill would cut taxes by $3.7 trillion while raising deficits by $2.4 trillion over a decade.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lululemon's stock is on pace for one of its biggest routs in history after the athleisure maker warned that tariffs will dent its profit. The company cut its full-year guidance citing a “dynamic macroenvironment” that includes a decline in visits to its US stores, the impact of tariffs and and rising competition from other brands, such as Vuori and Alo. Lululemon (LULU) shares plunged more than 17% Friday, on pace for the stock's worst day in more than five years and its fourth-worst day ever. Following the likes of Nike, Roger Federer-backed On and other similiar brands, Lululemon will also implement “strategic price increases” on a “small portion” of its lineup that includes pricey yoga pants, shoes and shorts, Chief Financial Officer Meghan Frank revealed on the call, but said the price hikes “will be modest in nature.” Despite that, McDonald said Lululemon is “better positioned than most” to endure and navigate the financial environment because it has $1.3 billion in cash and no debt, “which provides us significant financial flexibility,” he said. Lululemon is the latest company to reduce its guidance because of the at-least 30% tariffs on imports from China and 10% tariffs from other countries implemented by President Donald Trump. Sister brand Old Navy also recently launched a new, budget-friendly activewear line this month, that could further pressure Lululemon and attract budget-conscious customers. Lululemon stock is down about 11% for the year. Most stock quote data provided by BATS. US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

USAID was an independent agency to provide impoverished countries aid and offer development assistance, but the agency was upended since February when President Donald Trump installed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to oversee the organization amid concerns that USAID did not advance U.S. core interests. This increased scrutiny on USAID spending is valid, according to Risch. "The amount of money that we're spending on that has to be reviewed top to bottom," Risch said during an event Wednesday at the Washington-based think tank the Hudson Institute. This increased scrutiny on USAID spending is valid, according to Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho. Risch said that several weeks into the Trump administration, he and others, including Rubio, evaluated a list of programs that detailed $3 million in funding for "promotion of democracy in Lower Slobovia." According to Risch, the description didn't provide enough information and items like these are totaling up to billions of dollars that must undergo review. "Lower Slobovia" is a fictional place and a term used by Americans to describe an underdeveloped foreign country. "So, if you say, well, we're eliminating this program, be careful you don't say, 'Oh, that means we're walking away from human rights.' If America leads the way on human rights. We are the world standard on human rights. We have no intention of giving that position up." The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) targeted USAID in its push to eliminate wasteful spending. The agency came under fire for many funding choices, including allocating $1.5 million for a program that sought to "advance diversity, equity and inclusion in Serbia's workplaces and business communities" and a $70,000 program for a "DEI musical" in Ireland. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and James Risch, R-Idaho, attend the Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing for Marco Rubio to be Secretary of State on January 15, 2025. As a result, Rubio announced on March 11 that the State Department completed a six-week review and would cancel more than 80% of USAID programs — cutting roughly 5,200 of USAID's 6,200 programs. Fox News Digital was the first to report later in March that the State Department planned to absorb the remaining operations and programs USAID runs so it would no longer function as an independent agency. The move means eliminating thousands of staff members in an attempt to enhance the existing, "life-saving" foreign assistance programs, according to a State Department memo that Fox News Digital obtained. Sen. Jim Risch said the increased scrutiny evaluating USAID funding is warranted. "Foreign assistance done right can advance our national interests, protect our borders, and strengthen our partnerships with key allies," Rubio said in a March statement to Fox News Digital. "Unfortunately, USAID strayed from its original mission long ago. "We are reorienting our foreign assistance programs to align directly with what is best for the United States and our citizens," Rubio said. "We are continuing essential lifesaving programs and making strategic investments that strengthen our partners and our own country." "Donald Trump and Elon Musk's destruction and dismantling of USAID is not only disastrous foreign policy and counter to our national security interests; it is plainly illegal," the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., said in a statement in March. "Congress wrote a law establishing USAID as an independent agency with its own appropriation, and only Congress can eliminate it."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why does flying seem to bring out the worst in us? Airplanes are, quite literally, a pressure cooker for emotions. For many, airports and airplanes are synonymous with anxiety, which often begins well before they step into the terminal. These environments combine stress, discomfort and a loss of control, often leaving even the calmest travelers feeling on edge. We've all experienced the envy of walking through first-class cabins to reach economy. It's easy to see why air rage has become so common. But more importantly, what we can do about it. In recent years, reports of unruly passenger behavior around the world have surged. In 2021, the administration recorded 5,973 incidents of unruly passenger behavior. This is a staggering 492% increase compared to the year before. While the numbers have decreased since their peak in 2021, they remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Since 2021, fines totalling more than $21 million have been levied as a result of such incidents. The most common types of incidents include non-compliance, verbally abusive behavior and intoxication. Notably, while non-compliance incidents initially fell after mask mandates were removed on most flights, the frequency began to rise again in 2022, ending the year 37% higher than in 2021. Related article Solo flyers on US flights can pay much more than those traveling as a pair, report finds Scholarly research has highlighted that the phenomenon arises from an interplay of stressors unique to aviation. Research consistently identifies the physical environment of airplanes as a significant contributor to passenger frustration and antisocial behavior. Psychological factors such as anxiety, claustrophobia and aviophobia (fear of flying) can also trigger an unusual behavior that the passenger may not show in other social contexts. In some studies, physical discomfort, such as encroachments into personal space, has been found the leading trigger for anger among passengers. Emotional triggers such as frustration over delays, long lines at the security check or unmet service expectations, can escalate minor grievances into disruptive outbursts. It can create a volatile atmosphere even before passengers acted out. Research has also suggested that low-cost carriers, while not directly responsible for air rage, create environments conducive to disruptive behavior due to reduced service levels, inadequate facilities and passenger stress from automation and cost-cutting measures. Interestingly, situational inequality can even affect first-class passengers, by highlighting their privileges, sometimes fostering a sense of entitlement that may lead to antisocial behavior. Alcohol is a dominant precipitant of air rage incidents. Some studies have found that more than half of reported air rage cases involved alcohol intoxication, often fuelled by liberal airport alcohol policies and in-flight consumption. Empirical data suggest sociodemographic factors play a significant role in air rage incidents. One study examining 228 air rage cases found nearly 90% of incidents involved male passengers, with younger adults, particularly those aged 30–39, being the most frequently implicated. Cultural norms and expectations around air travel also influence behavior. They shape how passengers respond to delays, discomfort, breaches of etiquette or perceived inequities. Related article They became millionaires – in frequent flyer points In the UK, airlines and airport authorities have implemented measures, such as Edinburgh's “No Excuse for Abuse” campaign, to address the rise in disruptive behavior. De-escalation techniques and early recognition of disruptive behavior can help diffuse situations before they escalate. Studies suggest experienced and well-trained crew members are better equipped to handle such incidents. There are also simple things you can do to improve the flying experience. Ultimately, it may be helpful to remember that air travel isn't always glamorous. Milad Haghani is a senior lecturer in urban risk and resilience at UNSW Sydney.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong stands outside the Legislative Council building in Hong Kong, Thursday, Nov. 28, 2019. HONG KONG (AP) — Prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong on Friday was charged with conspiracy to collude with foreign forces to endanger national security under a Beijing-imposed law that critics say has crushed Hong Kong's once-thriving pro-democracy movement. He was already convicted in a separate subversion case linked to an unofficial primary election and was sentenced last year to four years and eight months in jail for that charge. The prosecution accused Wong, 28, of conspiring with fellow activist Nathan Law and others to ask foreign countries, institutions, organizations or individuals outside of China to impose sanctions or blockades, or engage in other hostile actions, against Hong Kong and China. The alleged offenses occurred between July 2020 and November 2020. The charge carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. After hearing the charge in court, Wong, who wore a blue shirt and was visibly thinner, said he “understood” the charge. National security police arrested Wong in Stanley prison on Friday on the new national security charge and also on suspicion of “dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offense,” police said in a statement. Wong rose to prominence in Hong Kong in 2012 as a high school student leading protests against the introduction of national education in the city's schools. Two years later, he became world famous as a leader of the Occupy Movement. In 2016, Wong co-founded a political party named Demosisto with fellow young activists Law and Agnes Chow. His activism led Beijing to label him an advocate of Hong Kong's independence who “begged for interference” by foreign forces. Demosisto disbanded when Beijing imposed the security law in 2020. In 2023, Hong Kong authorities offered rewards of 1 million Hong Kong dollars ($127,600) for information leading to the arrests of Law, who moved to Britain, and several other overseas-based activists. Amnesty International's China Director Sarah Brooks said in a statement that the new prosecution against Wong showed the security law's “capacity to be used by Hong Kong authorities to threaten human rights in the city is as potent and present as ever.” “This latest charge against him underscores the authorities' fear of prominent dissidents and shows the lengths they will go to keep them behind bars for as long as possible -- in so doing, continuing a chilling effect on civic activism in the city,” she said, urging the government to drop the charge and cease enforcing the law.</p>

Any reasonable American could objectively ask what exactly President Donald Trump's new travel ban, which affects a dozen countries, is about. Is it about protecting Americans from “murderers,” as Trump said Thursday, or punishing small countries for a modest number of students who overstayed their visas? The drive for Trump's first-term travel ban in 2017 and 2018 was clear. It was only by agreeing to ignore Trump's anti-Muslim 2016 campaign statements and focus solely on the security-related language in his third attempt at a travel ban that the US Supreme Court ultimately gave its blessing to that ban. Trump is using that authority again in his second term. It was an attack on Jewish community members in Colorado by an Egyptian national that convinced Trump to speed up plans to ban people from a dozen countries from entering the US, restarting the travel ban policy he pioneered during his first term. But Egypt is not on the travel ban list. “Egypt has been a country we deal with very closely. They have things under control,” Trump told reporters Thursday. Instead, the travel ban includes countries that Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who assembled the list, feel don't have things under control. Neither is a nexus of terror threatening the American homeland. Trump's order announcing the travel ban explains that these countries have high rates of students and other travelers overstaying their visas in the US. It points to a report of DHS “overstay” data from 2023 to argue that for more than 70% of people from Equatorial Guinea with US student visas, there is no record of them leaving the US when their visa ended. In real numbers, that equals 233 people with student visas. The numbers are similarly small for other African countries. “They're just throwing things at the wall,” said David Bier, an immigration expert at the libertarian-leaning Cato institute and a Trump immigration policy critic. “There's not really a coherent philosophy behind any of this,” Bier added. The reinstated travel ban does include countries associated with terrorism, including Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, all of which were also included in Trump's first-term travel ban. But it's worth noting that no immigrant or traveler from one of these countries has launched a terror attack on the US in recent years, according to a review by the Washington Post during Trump's first term. “The president claims that there is no way to vet these nationals, yet that is exactly what his consular officers and border officials have successfully done for decades,” Bier said. The man responsible for the ISIS-inspired truck bomb in New Orleans in January, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, was a Texas-born Army veteran and US citizen. The new travel ban also includes Afghanistan, which could jeopardize many Afghans related to those who aided the US during its war there, as Shawn VanDiver, president of the aid organization #AfghanEvac, told CNN's Jim Sciutto on Thursday. “There are 12,000 people who have been separated through the actions of our government, who have been waiting for more than three and a half years,” he said. “It's our honor to have them, frankly, we want to have foreign students, but we want them to be checked,” Trump said, suggesting there will be even more strenuous background checks in the future.</p>

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — There is an unmistakable air of Peckham these days in Bosnia's capital, Sarajevo, as the legendary yellow three-wheeled van from the BBC's long-running sitcom “Only Fools and Horses” cruises the city streets. The Fatics are dealers in home appliances, running a successful company with dozens of employees and a huge shop on the outskirts of Sarajevo. Tarik Fatic sits down in the Reliant Regal, an exact copy of the famous BBC TV show “Only Fools and Horses” iconic yellow car in Hadzici, suburb of Sarajevo, Bosnia, Wednesday, June 4, 2025. Over the course of seven series and several Christmas specials, the Trotters tried various get-rich-quick schemes, buying low-quality or sometimes black-market goods and selling them at the market. Many in Bosnia and in the wider Balkans easily identify with the Trotters' endless wheeling and dealing. Tarik Fatic along with his brother Mirnes drives the Reliant Regal, an exact copy of the famous BBC TV show “Only Fools and Horses” iconic yellow car in Sarajevo, Bosnia, Wednesday, June 4, 2025. Also from a working-class family, and growing up in a country that was devastated in the bloody 1992-95 ethnic conflict, the brothers tried trading in food, poultry and clothes before settling on home appliances. “The market (in Bosnia) is still disorganized and unstable,” Tarik Fatic, 33, said. “Not a day passes without the two (Del Boy and Rodney) crossing my mind.” Known here as Mucke, which actually means something like wheeling and dealing, “Only Fools and Horses” became hugely popular throughout what was still Yugoslavia from the 1980s onwards. Murals with images of main characters have been painted on the walls; many cafes were named after the series, while visiting actors were greeted with frenzy. The Reliant Regal was made by a British company, famous for its eccentric vehicles, that went out of business in 2002. In Sarajevo, people wave, take pictures with their phones, honk their horns when they see the yellow van in the streets. The Fatic brothers imported it from Manchester six months ago after a long search. It took a while to register the unusual vehicle, said Mirnes Fatic, 38.

The Fatic brothers have also named their company after the series — Only Fools and Horses Brothers Mucke. There have been some doubts how clients and banks would react but it turned out really well, Mirnes added. “We hope and believe that this time next year, we will be millionaires,” he smiled, using the famous phrase from the show.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While declining to name specific examples, Murphy said Democrats' 2024 messaging of saving democracy “fell flat” because voters thought “this version of democracy seems rigged” or “only works for the powerful.” Murphy's comments came at a liberal event in Washington D.C., moderated by Neera Tanden, who is under congressional investigation into whether White House aides covered up former President Joe Biden's health decline. Neither Tanden nor Murphy addressed the controversy, which escalated this week when Trump ordered an investigation into Biden's White House and the House Oversight Committee subpoenaing Biden's doctor. “I think young people do fundamentally believe that the Democratic Party is just as corrupt as the Republican Party is, and so while they're noticing Trump's corruption, they don't see it as a reason to come out on the streets, because the alternative doesn't look much better,” Murphy said, citing Trump accepting a luxury jet from Qatar as one example. Murphy told the audience that Democrats have a habit of normalizing corrupt government acts by not bringing enough attention to them. He criticized the Left for their treatment of male mental health in what he deems as a post-feminism “loss of meaning and purpose.” Democrats have responded that men should “get over it,” and “that's not satisfactory,” Murphy said. “There is a difference between male identity and female identity and there are still some really important things about masculinity, whether it be physicality or risk-taking, that are still core parts of your identity that you do not have to lose even in a moment when you are competing, rightfully, with women in the workplace,” Murphy said. Murphy, who is considered a possible 2028 presidential contender, said Democrats also need to be authentic. We've got to start talking in an unfiltered way more often,” said Murphy, noting he runs his own social media accounts.

American Airlines plane catches fire at Denver International Airport. They landed safely, but soon after arriving at a gate, passengers and crew members noticed fire and smoke filling the cabin. The plane was towed to a hangar for examination. An American Airlines plane that caught fire in Denver had dark streaking which was consistent with in-flight streamlines, according to a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report. In addition, "the lockwire of a fuel fitting on the variable stator vane (VSV)" was loose and installed in the incorrect direction, in addition to other issues. Further examination of the engines found that one fan blade platform was fractured, according to the report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt brushed aside a question from a reporter on Elon Musk‘s assertion that Donald Trump hasn't released the files regarding the late convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein because the president is in them. Musk feuded with Trump on an epic scale Thursday, appearing to call for his impeachment and decommissioning his Dragon spacecraft, among other things, as a result. “This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,” Leavitt said. “The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again.” Musk said earlier on Thursday that Trump is in the Epstein files and that is why they haven't been made fully public. Attorney General Pam Bondi promised a full release months ago, but the FBI says they are still redacting victims' likenesses. That is the real reason they have not been made public,” he posted. The president told New York magazine in 2002 what he knew of Epstein, whose 2019 death in a prison cell while he was awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges was ruled a suicide. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. Musk thinks the bill doesn't cut spending enough, while Trump has pushed Congress to pass the legislation to keep his tax cuts in effect.</p>

Mexican drug cartels are getting help from the Chinese to build their drug empire that feeds off American consumers. Border patrol officials intercepted 50,000 kilos of precursor chemicals this week used in the process of manufacturing methamphetamines, sent from China and intended for members of the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico. "For far too long, the Mexican drug cartels have raked in billions of dollars at the expense of our local communities leaving nothing but addiction, death and despair in their wake," said Chad Plantz, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent in Charge in Houston. "This initiative provides HSI with a game-changing method to stay one step ahead of the cartels by disrupting the flow of chemicals that they depend on to produce illicit narcotics." The seizure was part of an ongoing initiative launched in 2019 to identify suspicious shipments of precursor chemicals from China, India and other countries that are destined for Mexican drug cartels. Immigration officials' bust comes amid news of a spate of other incidents involving Chinese nationals or individuals working for China who have engaged in espionage efforts, ranging from agroterroism and selling military secrets, to infiltrating U.S. universities and utilizing American-based products to sow political divisions online. In the latest incident, two Chinese nationals were charged with allegedly smuggling a "dangerous biological pathogen" into the U.S. to study at a University of Michigan laboratory. This happened amid controversy over the Trump administration's effort to intensify visa scrutiny for Chinese nationals trying to enter the United States. Last month, an expansive investigation by a group of Stanford students detailed how there is a culture of students and faculty at their school doing work for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The report highlighted how some students want to work with the Chinese government, such as through sharing intellectual property or aligning their research priorities with Chinese interests, while others are sometimes coerced into doing work for the CCP, particularly if they have family back in Beijing. Chinese Nationals Charged with Conspiracy and Smuggling a Dangerous Biological Pathogen into the U.S. for their Work at a University of Michigan Laboratory (Detroit Free Press/IMAGN) Meanwhile, just this week, reports of Chinese efforts to steal U.S. state secrets or sow political divisions have surfaced. On Friday, the Department of Justice indicted two Chinese nationals and a lawful permanent resident for conspiring to traffic sensitive American military technology to the CCP. American artifical intelligence company OpenAI this week also shutdown a Chinese-linked influence operation that was utilizing its ChatGPT product to generate social media posts and sow political division related to U.S. politics online. "The new visa policy is long overdue," Congresswoman Michele Steel said. "After four years of willful ignorance – or gross incompetence – under the Biden administration, President Trump has wasted no time in directing his administration to take the decisive, necessary action to finally thwart the pervasive and growing threat of Chinese communist espionage."
