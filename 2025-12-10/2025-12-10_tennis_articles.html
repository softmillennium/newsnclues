                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ricardas Berankis, the highest-ranked Lithuanian player in history, announced his retirement from professional tennis on Tuesday via a post on X. “Today is one of those days that seems like it will never come, but when it does, it touches me very sensitively and deeply,” wrote the 35-year-old. “I want to announce that I have made one of the most difficult decisions of my life – to end my professional tennis career.” 50 in the PIF ATP Rankings in 2016 and finished his career as a two-time finalist on the ATP Tour. “Twenty-five years is not just a number. It is a life path, a childhood dream of reaching the heights of tennis that I have been following,” Berankis continued. “This stage passed in a moment, but at the same time it left an unimaginable amount of excitement, struggle, victories, painful experiences, lasting memories, and acquaintances that will accompany me for the rest of my life.” “Every story has its beginning and its end… Today I am closing one of the most important chapters of my life, and I do so with peace and gratitude.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They arrive on the ATP scene from different corners of the tennis world, but Dino Prizmic, Learner Tien and Nicolai Budkov Kjaer share a common thread. Each has forged early career's through setbacks, adaptation and a relentless commitment to improvement. “When I had injury with my wrist, that was a very tough moment because I stopped with the tennis for a couple of months and after that, we solved that problem and I'm happy to be back and really pleased with what I could do in 2025," Prizmic told ATPTour.com. The 20-year-old, who will make his debut at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF later this month, keeps his approach to tactics simple: trust your instincts. “I think you just need to play your game and be focused on how you need to play,” Prizmic explained. The biggest leaps in Prizmic's level have been physical but he also has a music-fuelled process on match days: I also have a good process in place on matches which helps. It has worked so far this year overall." The 19-year-old also earned a tour-level win in Bastad. “Someone watching me for the first time can expect a modern tennis game,” Budkov Kjaer told ATPTour.com in October. “A powerful serve, fast balls from both sides. His willingness to adjust has already paid off. Mid-season, after working with his father to alter the mechanics of his serve, he surged to three ATP Challenger Tour titles. “I need to improve all areas of my game,” Budkov Kjaer admitted. I think all the best players always reinvent their game, maybe especially after losing and learning." Access to elite training blocks with top players accelerates that cycle. And like many Nordic talents, he draws motivation from close to home. “Casper [Ruud] has always inspired me,” Budkov Kjaer said. “He proved that it's possible to come from a small tennis country like Norway and achieve great things.” “I really enjoy the tactical aspect,” Tien told ATPTour.com. Tien, a Tour-level champion in Metz and a finalist in Beijing, doesn't overwhelm opponents with sheer force; he outthinks them. “I wouldn't say I'm someone who often blows people off the court,” said Tien, who is at a career-high No. “But I do a great job of adapting and problem-solving.” His improvements, particularly in his forehand and serve, have come through “a little bit of work each day” that compounds over time. I don't like thinking too much before matches, sometimes that stresses me out. Unlike many rising stars, Tien doesn't model himself after a specific player. Instead, he absorbs bits and pieces from everyone around him.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anticipation is building for the 2025 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, and this year's contenders know the track record is impossible to ignore. The 20-and-under showcase has evolved from a glimpse of potential into a springboard for future champions, highlighted by names who have already reshaped the sport, such as Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, the current World No. The field for the eighth edition features Learner Tien, Alexander Blockx, Dino Prizmic, Martin Landaluce, Nicolai Budkov Kjaer, Nishesh Basavareddy, Rafael Jodar and Justin Engel, all chasing a trophy that now comes with prestige. He has since amassed four major titles, offering early proof that the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF could be a powerful stepping stone, but Alcaraz's story raises the bar slightly further. Carlos Alcaraz beats Sebastian Korda for the 2021 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF title. Last year in Jeddah, Joao Fonseca provided the most immediate recent example of fast progress. Sinner, Alcaraz and Fonseca have reshaped how the event is perceived, but they are part of a broader picture rather than a guaranteed equation. Daniil Medvedev, who competed at the inaugural event in 2017, took a different route — slowly but equally deliberate — before lifting the US Open trophy in 2021 and rising to World No. Stefanos Tsitsipas won the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF in 2018 and then triumphed at the Nitto ATP Finals on his debut just 11 months later. Last year's finalist Tien has already experienced a powerful surge of his own. The American has climbed to a career-high No. You May Also Like: Learner Tien on the #NextGenATP surge: 'Everyone wants to catch the top guy' For Spaniards Landaluce and Jodar, the pathway is theirs to define, but the inspiration is immediate. Both have received advice from Alcaraz, while Landaluce has also benefitted from guidance at the Rafa Nadal Academy — insight that may not promise success, but helps soften the unknown that awaits. For eight rising talents, Jeddah represents the first big test of whether possibility can become greatness.
