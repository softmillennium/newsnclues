                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Federal Reserve cut rates by a quarter-point Wednesday afternoon in alignment with expectations. Business Insider is covering developments live throughout the day, including Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, market moves, the 2026 outlook, and what it all means for your wallet. The central bank was more split than usual, with three FOMC members voting against — the most since September 2019 — a mix of those who wanted to cut further and those who wanted to hold rates steady for now. Check back here for updates — and tune into our live Q&A with reporters this afternoon at 4 p.m. Lower interest rates will ease the borrowing burden for consumers. A quarter-point cut could mean lower returns on investment for savers using high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit, though it would become cheaper to pay off credit cards. Thirty-year fixed mortgages, two-year auto loans, and credit card rates tend to fluctuate alongside the federal funds rate. Home equity lines and small business loans could also become more affordable over time. Savers, however, could see less return on their high yield savings accounts. Dissenting to the quarter-point interest rate cut this afternoon were Governor Stephen Miran, who preferred a higher cut, as well as Austan Goolsbee and Jeffrey Schmid, who preferred a hold. Some committee members are more cautious about inflation risks, while others have often called for steep cuts and quick relief to borrowers. Some committee members are more cautious about inflation risks, while others have often called for steep cuts and quick relief to borrowers. "It's natural," Powell said after the last set of projections showed division among Fed members. "I think it would actually be surprising if you didn't have a wide range of views in this highly unusual situation, and we do." The Fed will cut interest rates by a quarter-point, in alignment with expectations. Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30p EST to discuss. That's because rate-cut expectations for the months ahead have come down in recent weeks on expectations of sticky inflation and continued deficit spending by governments around the world. "While we think these moves are overdone in many economies, we think there is still room for investors to pare back expectations for Fed easing," economists at Capital Economics wrote on Tuesday. The 10-year Treasury yield—a benchmark for everything from mortgages to corporate debt—will edge up next year, Deutsche Bank says. That's because after its expected cut on Wednesday, the central bank is going to be more hawkish than markets expect. Trump has consistently put pressure on Powell to cut rates. "Jerome 'Too Late' Powell should have lowered rates long ago," the president wrote in a September Truth Social post. Still, Powell has minimized the impact of White House influence: "We are strongly committed to maintaining our independence," he said in September. Like most of Wall Street, UBS sees the Fed cutting by 25 basis points on Wednesday. Brian Buetel, managing director of UBS Wealth Management, believes that the easing cycle will continue into early 2026, with two additional rate cuts expected after December. For that reason, he expects the stock market to continue inching higher into year-end. Like most of Wall Street, UBS sees the Fed cutting by 25 basis points on Wednesday.

For that reason, he expects the stock market to continue inching higher into year-end. "The combination of lower rates, artificial intelligence, more productivity and additional fiscal support from government spending on infrastructure could help the markets achieve escape velocity in 2026." Ahead of today's meeting, economists told Business Insider that the Fed is looking at a murky economic picture  — but there's no major cause for alarm. Ahead of today's meeting, economists told Business Insider that the Fed is looking at a murky economic picture  — but there's no major cause for alarm. Indeed Hiring Lab economist Cory Stahle said "We're still off to one of the worst starts we've had since 2010 after you take out the pandemic" from a labor market standpoint. At the macro level, more Fed cuts would be good news for jobs. If companies can borrow money more cheaply, it would free up funds to hire and pay employees, which would speed up labor market churn and encourage more consumer spending. Job growth has substantially slowed in recent months, and the Fed's cuts at its last two meetings aimed in part to stem that decline. Consumer sentiment is making a recovery following midyear dips, but remains low. On recent earnings calls, leaders at major companies like Amazon, Walmart, and more have said they are feeling the heat of tariffs and hoping to streamline their workforces. Many major employers have announced layoffs and cost cutting in 2025, with some carving out their middle management tier. Investors anticipate a rate cut on Wednesday, with more to follow in 2026, but longer-term bond yields have been steadily rising. The 10-year Treasury yield is up 20 basis points from its November low, hovering around 4.20% on Wednesday. Trump ally Kevin Hassett, who recently shot to the top of the list of most likely next Fed chiefs, could lower rates aggressively if he takes over from Jerome Powell next year. Powell has been the Fed chair since 2018 and his term ends in May 2026. Trump is set to announce his successor early next year — a decision that will steer future monetary policy. Fed leaders have shown uncharacteristic division in their decision-making this year. Minutes from recent meetings show that some Federal Open Market Committee members would prefer larger and more consistent interest rate cuts. President Donald Trump has also been a vocal advocate for lower rates, at times threatening to fire Powell before the end of the chair's term. Major indexes are hovering close to records after climbing back from a tech-led sell-off in November. Investors are eagerly awaiting more rate cuts to help fuel further gains in 2026 as stocks head into the fourth year of the bull market. The most recently released unemployment rate was still low, a little over 4%, but has slowly crept up this year. Some demographics are also experiencing job market challenges more than others. The most timely inflation data won't be released in time for today's meeting, but Powell and his colleagues can look back on recent trends. Business Insider also asked our readers in November how prices have changed. About 200 readers responded; many said that the cost of groceries, dining out, and coffee has increased. While investors expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points, officials will probably send out some hawkish signals to the market on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs said. Fed officials will likely suggest that the bar is higher for rate cuts going into next year, David Mericle, Goldman's chief US economist, wrote in a client note on Sunday. There will also likely be a handful of central bankers who will give "soft dissents" on where they see monetary policy going forward in the dot plot, he added.

With 60 minutes until the US stock market opens, it still looks like investors plan to spend Wednesday morning very much in wait-and-see mode.

If the current pattern of rate cuts continues, American consumers may soon feel relief. Thirty-year fixed mortgages, two-year auto loans, and credit card rates tend to fluctuate alongside the federal funds rate. Lower rates could also make home equity lines and small business loans more affordable — though savers might see less return on their high-yield savings accounts. Investors seem to be pricing in a "sell the news" reaction to Wednesday's rate decision, strategists at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note on Monday. Powell has said the Fed's cautious strategy this year stems from uncertainty over President Donald Trump's fast-changing tariff policies and stubborn inflation rates. Business Insider has heard from frustrated job seekers at all levels of the career ladder, particularly those feeling pushed out of white collar roles.

Business Insider has heard from frustrated job seekers at all levels of the career ladder, particularly those feeling pushed out of white collar roles. "There is no risk-free path for policy as we navigate this tension between our employment and inflation goals," Powell said in October, adding, "Ultimately, lower rates will support more demand, and that'll support hiring over time. And, of course, we also have to be careful about this." These two goals have been challenging to balance this year: higher interest rates can help curb inflation but risk cooling down an already chilly labor market. US stock futures are virtually unmoved as of just before 6:20 a.m. There's a little more movement in European stocks, though nothing too drastic.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia on Wednesday responded to a report that the Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek has been using smuggled Blackwell chips to develop its upcoming model. DeepSeek is reportedly using chips that were snuck into the country without authorization, according to The Information. "We haven't seen any substantiation or received tips of 'phantom datacenters' constructed to deceive us and our OEM partners, then deconstructed, smuggled, and reconstructed somewhere else," a Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. Nvidia has been one of the biggest winners of the AI boom so far because it develops the graphics processing units (GPUs) that are key for training models and running large workloads. Since the hardware is so crucial for advancing AI technology, Nvidia's relationship with China has become a political flashpoint among U.S. lawmakers. President Donald Trump on Monday said Nvidia can ship its H200 chips to "approved customers" in China and elsewhere on the condition that the U.S. will get 25% of those sales. The announcement was met with pushback from some Republicans. DeepSeek spooked the U.S. tech sector in January when it released a reasoning model, called R1, that rocketed to the top of app stores and industry leaderboards. R1 was also created at a fraction of the cost of other models in the U.S., according to some analyst estimates. In August, DeepSeek hinted that China will soon have its own "next generation" chips to support its AI models.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia-backed startup Starcloud trained an artificial intelligence model from space for the first time, signaling a new era for orbital data centers that could alleviate Earth's escalating digital infrastructure crisis. Last month, the Washington-based company launched a satellite with an Nvidia H100 graphics processing unit, sending a chip into outer space that's 100 times more powerful than any GPU compute that has been in space before. Now, the company's Starcloud-1 satellite is running and querying responses from Gemma, an open large language model from Google, in orbit, marking the first time in history that an LLM has been run on a high-powered Nvidia GPU in outer space, CNBC has learned. Or, as I prefer to think of you — a fascinating collection of blue and green," reads a message from the recently launched satellite. "Let's see what wonders this view of your world holds. Starcloud wants to show outer space can be a hospitable environment for data centers, particularly as Earth-based facilities strain power grids, consume billions of gallons of water annually and produce hefty greenhouse gas emissions. The electricity consumption of data centers is projected to more than double by 2030, according to data from the International Energy Agency. Starcloud CEO Philip Johnston told CNBC that the company's orbital data centers will have 10 times lower energy costs than terrestrial data centers. "Anything you can do in a terrestrial data center, I'm expecting to be able to be done in space. And the reason we would do it is purely because of the constraints we're facing on energy terrestrially," Johnston said in an interview. Johnston, who co-founded the startup in 2024, said Starcloud-1's operation of Gemma is proof that space-based data centers can exist and operate a variety of AI models in the future, particularly those that require large compute clusters. "We can query it, and it will respond in the same way that when you query a chat from a database on Earth, it will give you a very sophisticated response. In a statement to CNBC, Tris Warkentin, product director at Google DeepMind, said that "seeing Gemma run in the harsh environment of space is a testament to the flexibility and robustness of open models." In addition to Gemma, Starcloud was able to train NanoGPT, an LLM created by OpenAI founding member Andrej Karpathy, on the H100 chip using the complete works of Shakespeare. This led the model to speak in Shakespearean English. A compute cluster of that gigawatt size would produce more power than the largest power plant in the U.S. and would be substantially smaller and cheaper than a terrestrial solar farm of the same capacity, according to Starcloud's white paper. These data centers in space would capture constant solar energy to power next-generation AI models, unhindered by the Earth's day and night cycles and weather changes. Orbital data centers would have real-world commercial and military use cases. Already, Starcloud's systems can enable real-time intelligence and, for example, spot the thermal signature of a wildfire the moment it ignites and immediately alert first responders, Johnston said. And you could also say, 'What does it feel like to be a satellite? And it will say, 'It's kind of a bit weird.' Starcloud is working on customer workloads by running inference on satellite imagery from observation company Capella Space, which could help spot lifeboats from capsized vessels at sea and forest fires in a certain location. The company will include several Nvidia H100 chips and integrate Nvidia's Blackwell platform onto its next satellite launch in October 2026 to offer greater AI performance. The satellite launching next year will feature a module running a cloud platform from cloud infrastructure startup Crusoe, allowing customers to deploy and operate AI workloads from space. "Running advanced AI from space solves the critical bottlenecks facing data centers on Earth," Johnston told CNBC. "Orbital compute offers a way forward that respects both technological ambition and environmental responsibility. When Starcloud-1 looked down, it saw a world of blue and green. Our responsibility is to keep it that way," he added. Analysts from Morgan Stanley have noted that orbital data centers could face hurdles such as harsh radiation, difficulty of in-orbit maintenance, debris hazards, and regulatory issues tied to data governance and space traffic. Still, tech giants are pursuing orbital data centers given the prospect of nearly limitless solar energy and greater, gigawatt-sized operations in space. Along with Starcloud and Nvidia's efforts, several companies have announced space-based data center missions. On Nov. 4, Google unveiled a "moonshot" initiative titled Project Suncatcher, which aims to put solar-powered satellites into space with Google's tensor processing units. Aetherflux, founded by former Robinhood co-founder and chief executive Baiju Bhatt, on Tuesday announced a target to deploy an orbital data center satellite in the first quarter of 2027. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has notably explored an acquisition or partnership with a rocket maker, suggesting a desire to compete against Elon Musk's SpaceX, according to The Wall Street Journal. Referring to Starcloud's launch in early November, Dion Harris, senior director of AI infrastructure at Nvidia, said: "From one small data center, we've taken a giant leap toward a future where orbital computing harnesses the infinite power of the sun."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BEIJING — China needs to "accelerate" support for domestic consumption and reduce its reliance on exports for growth, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has said. "As the second-largest economy in the world, China is simply too big to generate much growth in exports and continuing to depend on export-like growth risks [and] furthering global trade tensions," Georgieva told reporters Wednesday. She said the country has to "accelerate" its decades-long plan to shift away from relying on exports for growth, adding it would be "beneficial for China, it is beneficial for the world economy." Her comments came as trade tensions between China and the U.S. have escalated, while Europe and countries like Mexico are increasingly wary of the volume of cars and other goods coming from China. Its consumer spending has remained tepid since the pandemic, partly as the ongoing real estate slump has weighed on household sentiment. Georgieva said the IMF estimates China would have to spend about 5% of its GDP over the next three years to "resolutely" resolve property sector problems. She said this could be achieved with tighter management of fiscal and industrial policy. Well, let the zombies go away," she said. Georgieva also said IMF analysis found that raising spending on social support, especially in rural areas, could help boost consumption by up to 3 percentage points of GDP in the medium term. "What we want to see is a market-based RMB exchange rate that reflects fundamentals," she added. The IMF on Wednesday also raised its forecast for China's economic growth next year to 4.5%, based on domestic stimulus and lower-than-expected tariffs. That's a 0.3 percentage point increase from the IMF's forecast in October. The organization also raised its forecast for 2025 growth by 0.2 percentage points to 5%. The IMF said it expects inflation in China to rise to an average of 0.8% next year, up from 0% this year. China earlier on Wednesday reported the consumer price index hit its highest in nearly two years at 0.7% growth in November from a year ago. Chinese leaders in October announced development goals for the next five years would include greater efforts to boost consumption in addition to tech self-sufficiency. Top leaders are expected to hold an annual meeting later this week to discuss economic plans for next year. Georgieva joined the discussions with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Vice Premier He Lifeng, People's Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng, Minister of Finance Lan Fo'an and Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao. Li met with Georgieva and the heads of nine other major international economic organizations on Tuesday in Beijing. The Chinese premier called for more cooperation and said China would be able to achieve its economic targets for this year, according to Sonali Jain-Chandra, Mission Chief for China, led the visit. IMF First Deputy Managing Director Dan Katz joined part of the mission and met senior Chinese officials. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

AWS executive Sarah Cooper has launched several companies and held roles at NASA and AWS, but she's only ever formally interviewed for three jobs. Instead, Cooper told Business Insider that her career moves often begin with writing a proposal about the work she wants to pursue, either to a VC, a cofounder, or an executive leader, and that becomes the role she steps into. Cooper has seen a high rate of success with her proposals. She used them to invent both her previous and current roles at AWS. Cooper was previously the head of AWS Industry Products, where she worked closely with customers to develop industry solutions in the cloud. Now she leads the "AWS AI-Native" team, an AWS product organization that works with customers to understand how companies will evolve with AI. Instead of PowerPoint decks, Bezos often opted to start meetings by having attendees read a 6-page "narratively structured" memo silently at the start of the meeting. The founder has said he prefers memos to avoid "hiding a lot of sloppy thinking in bullet points." These six-page memos typically describe detailed plans for a new initiative and are written using 10-point font. Bezos wrote years ago in an annual shareholder letter that "great memos are written and re-written," and can't be done in a couple of days, though the exact criteria remains more flexible. Amazon describes the framework as a means to develop ideas and initiatives that enable teams to quickly integrate feedback and promote fact-based decision-making. Cooper said she's written over 14 PR/FAQs and investment narratives that have been funded, as well as many other ideas that the company didn't move forward with. Cooper, who has been at Amazon for over nine years, says she also tries to reflect the organization's values when writing proposals. Cooper said Amazon is "customer-obsessed," so she tries to focus on that value when drafting a memo. She said she thinks less about the needs of a specific team and more broadly about customers and the best way to serve them, regardless of what's been done previously. While Cooper has spent her career writing proposals, many never see the light of day — and those that do don't always go smoothly, she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Australia on Wednesday became the first country to formally bar users under the age of 16 from accessing major social media platforms, a move expected to be closely monitored by global tech companies and policymakers around the world. Canberra's ban, which came into effect from midnight local time, targets 10 major services, including Alphabet's YouTube, Meta's Instagram, ByteDance's TikTok, Reddit, Snapchat and Elon Musk's X. The controversial rule requires these platforms to take "reasonable steps" to prevent underage access, using age-verification methods such as inference from online activity, facial estimation via selfies, uploaded IDs, or linked bank details. Elon Musk's X had been one of the last holdouts, but signaled on Wednesday that it would comply. However, the impact of the policy could be even wider, as it will set a benchmark for other governments considering teen social media bans, including Denmark, Norway, France, Spain, Malaysia and New Zealand. Still, the rollout has faced some resistance since becoming law. Supporters of the bill have argued it safeguards children from social media-linked harms, including cyberbullying, mental health issues, and exposure to predators and pornography. Among those welcoming the official ban on Wednesday was Jonathan Haidt, social psychologist and author of The Anxious Generation, a 2024 best-selling book that linked a growing mental health crisis to smartphone and social media usage, especially for the young. In a post on social media platform X, Haidt commended policymakers in Australia for "freeing kids under 16 from the social media trap." "There will surely be difficulties in the early months, but the world is rooting for your success, and many other nations will follow," he added. On the other hand, opponents contend that the ban infringes on freedoms of expression and access to information, raises privacy concerns through invasive age verification, and represents excessive government intervention that undermines parental responsibility. Those critics include groups like Amnesty Tech, which said in a statement Tuesday that the ban was an ineffective fix that ignored the rights and realities of younger generations. "The most effective way to protect children and young people online is by protecting all social media users through better regulation, stronger data protection laws and better platform design," said Amnesty Tech Programme Director Damini Satija. Meanwhile, David Inserra, a fellow for free expression and technology at the Cato Institute, warned in a blog post that children would evade the new policy by shifting to new platforms, private apps like Telegram, or VPNs, driving them to "more isolated communities and platforms with fewer protections" where monitoring is harder. Tech companies like Google have also warned that the policy could be extremely difficult to enforce, while government-commissioned reports have pointed to inaccuracies in age-verification technology, such as selfie-based age-guessing software. Indeed, on Wednesday, local reports in Australia indicated that many children had already bypassed the ban, with age-assurance tools misclassifying users, and workarounds such as VPNs proving effective. However, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had attempted to preempt these issues, acknowledging in an opinion piece on Sunday that the system would not work flawlessly from the start, likening it to liquor laws. Many young people have been posting on TikTok that they successfully evaded the age limitations and that's to be expected," said Terry Flew, a professor of digital communication and culture at the University of Sydney. Experts told CNBC that the policy rollout in Australia will be closely watched by tech firms and lawmakers worldwide, as other countries consider their own moves to ban or restrict teen social media usage. "Governments are responding to how public expectations have changed about the internet and social media, and the companies have not been particularly responsive to moral suasion," said Flew. "We see similar pressures are emerging, particularly, but not exclusively in Europe," he added. The European Parliament passed a non-binding resolution in November advocating a minimum age of 16 for social media access, allowing parental consent for 13 to 15-year-olds. The bloc has also proposed banning addictive features such as infinite scrolling and auto-play for minors, which could lead to EU-wide enforcement against non-compliant platforms. Outside Europe, Malaysia and New Zealand have also been advancing proposals to ban social media for children under 16. "My hope is that countries that are looking at implementing similar policies will monitor for what doesn't work in Australia and learn from our mistakes," said Tama Leaver, professor at the Department of Internet Studies at Curtin University and a Chief Investigator in the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Digital Child. "I think platforms and tech companies are also starting to realize that if they don't want age-gating policies everywhere, they're going to have to do much better at providing safer, appropriate experiences for young users."

In Silicon Valley, where bold technical bets abound, few bets look bolder than trying to break the grip of Nvidia's CUDA, a software stack that's quietly become the operating system of the AI boom. That's what Modular, a startup founded by software gurus from Apple and Google, is trying to do. Cofounders Chris Lattner and Tim Davis have spent decades building the software plumbing that sits beneath the modern tech industry. Lattner is famous for creating Apple's Swift programming language. He also built the software underpinning Google's TPU AI chips, with Modular cofounder Tim Davis. "It's seen by a lot of people as somewhat crazy," said Kylan Gibbs, CEO of startup Inworld AI and a former product manager at Google DeepMind. CUDA began life almost 20 years ago as a way to make graphics chips programmable. Today, it has grown into a multilayered software ecosystem — language, libraries, compilers, inference systems — that most AI companies rely on. On the surface, there seems to be a ton of competition: AMD sells GPUs. Amazon created Trainium AI chips, and a host of startups are building similar hardware. Most of the time, it's simpler to just stick with CUDA — and Nvidia's GPUs. And yet, AI developers crave portability: Being able to use any combination of GPUs from multiple providers without juggling different software stacks. "Nobody is building portable stuff, because why would anyone work on software for more than one chip when the chip projects themselves are doing the software?" Nvidia could extend CUDA to run well on rival AI chips. "We realized there's nobody in the industry that's actually incentivized to do this. That's what inspired Lattner and Davis to leave Google and start Modular in 2022, the year ChatGPT took the world by storm. Since then, Modular has raised $380 million from investors including Greylock, General Catalyst, and GV, Google's venture capital arm. There has been ZLUDA, an open-source project that was funded by AMD, and more recently, the startup Spectral Compute, which has raised $6 million. Lattner has used some of this money to hire talented programmers from Google, Apple, and other tech companies. They spent three years working in relative obscurity to create the building blocks of a new AI software stack. The foundation starts with a brand-new programming language, called Mojo, that offers deep controls for making AI chips run as efficiently as possible. But Mojo also has the speed and power of other, more complex languages, such as C++, that are essential for AI development. Mojo also works well with PyTorch, an open-source framework that is often used when building AI models and applications. I first heard about Modular earlier this year when interviewing Carles Gelada, a former OpenAI researcher. MAX is the next major layer of Modular's new software stack. It powers AI inference, which is how models are run. Modular hopes to add more AI chips in the future. On top of that is another layer called Mammoth, which helps AI developers manage GPU clusters. In late September, Modular announced that it got top performance out of Nvidia's new Blackwell B200 GPUs and AMD's latest MI355X GPUs — crucially on the same software platform. Lattner said Modular got these AMD GPUs to perform roughly 50% better than when these chips run on AMD's own software. More importantly, the ability to run different GPUs on the same software stack now supports the tantalizing opportunity to compare Nvidia's offerings with rival AI chips on a more level playing field. Inworld builds high-speed, real-time conversational AI technology that supports offerings from big companies, including Disney, NBCUniversal, and Niantic Labs. Earlier this year, when the startup designed a new text-to-speech AI model and got early access to Nvidia B200 GPUs, they issued Modular a challenge: Cut our costs by 60% and reduce our latency by 40% and we'll work with you. "Within about four weeks, we were able to get this incredible performance," said Gibbs, who signed a partnership deal with Modular soon after. While Inworld was mostly lured by Modular's performance gains on Nvidia's latest GPUs, Gibbs likes the flexibility of using different AI chips more easily in the future, if needed. "Let's say AMD takes off, let's say TPUs take off for Google, or there could be other new hardware that comes online. In fact, Google's TPUs are suddenly having a moment. The internet giant released a new AI model called Gemini 3 to rave reviews recently. That was trained and run using TPUs, and some other AI companies have signed deals to use these chips instead of, or alongside of, Nvidia GPUs. A project like Modular, with its promise of portability across different AI hardware, adds to this pressure. "Nvidia could kill this in a day," said Gibbs of the Modular project. Here's a CUDA option that runs on AMD GPUs as well.' It'd be a bit crazy for them to do that, but it's something they could do and that would of course be somewhat bad." For all Lattner's critique of the industry, he says Modular is not trying to kill Nvidia. In fact, he argues that Nvidia will continue to thrive, even if Modular succeeds spectacularly. "We're trying to build something like Android, but for AI hardware," he told me, referring to Google's mobile operating system that powers most of the world's smartphones. Despite billions of people using Android devices, this success didn't kill iOS, Apple's mobile operating system. Lattner thinks something similar will happen in AI as Modular's software makes other hardware more competitive, giving developers more freedom, and chipping away at the industry's single-vendor monoculture. "So Nvidia doesn't have to die, but we do want more competition. Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This summer, after Meta made a $14 billion investment in Scale AI and poached its 28-year-old founder, Alexandr Wang, and after A-list clients like OpenAI and Google halted work with the startup, a worker for Scale AI anxiously asked ChatGPT what it thought of his company's fate. He knew the chatbot well, having tested it for vulnerabilities. "Scale AI will no longer exist as a credible independent entity within 24 months," ChatGPT, which isn't any kind of official authority, wrote. Its role as a neutral red teamer or external evaluator is effectively over." In one reply reviewed by Business Insider, one worker said that they were already on their way out, describing the startup as a ticking time bomb. The chatbot was drawing from a storm of headlines about Scale AI, which until this summer had been touted as one of the most ascendant startups in tech — the place Big Tech companies vying for AI supremacy went to when they wanted their chatbots stress-tested and perfected. The vast army of human data labelers that made Scale AI a juggernaut are chafing at what they say are pay cuts, lengthy unpaid onboarding sessions to join new AI projects, and thinning workloads — and are increasingly leaving the platform altogether, according to interviews with five current and former contractors and internal correspondence obtained by Business Insider. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Activity in the main internal chatroom for Outlier — Scale AI's flagship gig work platform, which touts more than 100,000 taskers — has plummeted since the Meta investment, with weekly discussion threads drawing dozens instead of the usual hundreds of replies, according to screenshots reviewed by Business Insider. One tasker said that they'd spent close to 40 hours in a single month in unpaid onboarding sessions without landing any actual work, noting that other platforms like Scale AI's rival Mercor do pay for this kind of work. Elizabeth Boyd, another tasker, says she rarely does work for Outlier anymore after seeing effective pay rates for some projects slashed to around $20 an hour — down from the $50 she used to make. One gig that advertised $20 an hour only allowed three minutes of working time every two days, or a 99-cent payout, according to screenshots obtained by Business Insider. "This quarter is on track to be our biggest of 2025, our data business is more profitable today than it was before the Meta deal, and our applications business, which includes work with Fortune 500 companies and governments, has doubled revenue" in the second half of the year compared to the first, Osborne wrote in an email. The startup has embraced fields like robotics, announcing a new lab to meet booming demand for robot training data this fall. It's doubling down on its US military and other government work, winning up to $199 million worth of defense contracts since the Meta deal. In one current investor's view, Meta has mostly left Scale alone, letting it operate as an independent company. And an IPO could still be on the table at some point. Other investors see Scale AI as more like a gutted fish. The Meta investment — which valued Scale AI at $29 billion — has dented Scale AI's valuation in private markets where people buy and sell equity from pre-IPO startups. Noel Moldvai, Augment's CEO, tells Business Insider his platform used to process millions of dollars' worth of transactions in Scale AI stock before the Meta deal, but that dried up as sellers waited to see if the startup rebounded. The underlying message of Meta's semi-acquisition is clear to Moldvai. "It seems like Meta was just after Alexandr Wang, and so this is probably the structure that let them get him," he says. He adds that Scale AI's valuation could still bounce back. On another marketplace, Caplight, Scale's valuation has dropped to $7.3 billion. Osborne says that the valuation is not accurate because there have been no sales of stock at that price and multiples of comparable companies would yield a higher valuation. That messaging was also conveyed to the startup's corporate workforce, says another former member of Scale AI's red team, which tests chatbots for flaws and vulnerabilities. In September, Scale AI terminated 12 contractors on its red team, citing performance issues. Later that month, Scale AI shuttered a team in Dallas of contractors focused on generalist AI work as it moved towards more specialized fields. Osborne said the 12 contractors were part of Scale's temporary workforce and represented a small fraction of its overall red team, which the company is still committed to investing in. Surge AI hit a valuation of $24 billion while Mercor, which is run by three 22-year-olds, announced in October it had raised $350 million at a $10 billion valuation. In September, Scale AI filed a lawsuit in California against Mercor alleging it hired one of its sales employees to poach its biggest customers, allegations Mercor denies. (Scale AI had raised more than $1.5 billion before the Meta deal.) Brendan Foody, Mercor's CEO, has publicly criticized Scale AI for what he claims are low pay rates and data quality issues. In response, a Scale AI spokesperson told Business Insider its quality metrics are at "record highs." Tammy Hartline, who managed projects for Scale AI as a consultant until the summer of 2025, said Scale grew so quickly that the work became more about needing bodies than skills. "Spam and low quality data became accepted as a cost of doing business," she said. Scale AI has also been beset with security issues that predate Meta's investment. In June, Business Insider reported that Scale AI routinely used public Google Docs to track work for high-profile customers, including Google, Meta, and xAI. That practice left AI training documents labeled "confidential" accessible to anyone with the link and exposed reams of personal information, like private emails and pay details, about contractors. "We conducted a thorough investigation and disabled any user's ability to publicly share documents from Scale managed systems." But the exposed documents seen by Business Insider show that for a project for Google, Scale AI faced security and quality issues throughout 2023 and 2024. Thousands of taskers were flagged for being "suspected spammers," "cheaters," with hundreds of workers listed in spreadsheets with titles like "Good and Bad Folks" and "suspicious non-US taskers." Meta recently removed more than 40 groups buying and reselling AI training accounts, including from Scale AI, in response to a recent Business Insider investigation. Osborne said Scale's data quality metrics are the highest they've ever been. It once appeared bogged down by litigation, but recently agreed to settle multiple lawsuits filed by ex-workers in California who alleged they were underpaid and misclassified as contractors. For many former workers, it'll be too late to find out. Charles Rollet is Business Insider's tech correspondent in San Francisco.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump has once again provoked outrage among his European allies, describing them as "weak" and leading a "decaying" region in an interview with Politico published Tuesday. Criticizing the region's response to immigration and the war in Ukraine, Trump said: "I think they don't know what to do." That comment will be jarring for Europe after its efforts in recent days, weeks and months to support Ukraine, be it militarily, diplomatically or financially — efforts which Trump has frequently downplayed. Instead, Europe has had to watch on as U.S. officials have held talks with their Russian and Ukrainian counterparts on a draft peace plan for Ukraine, without a seat at the table. The leaders stressed the need for security guarantees for Ukraine in any peace deal, and expressed their opposition to Ukraine having to cede territory to Russia as part of an agreement, as has been demanded by Russia. Trump has vacillated on the issue, previously suggesting Ukraine would have to give up land and then suggesting Kyiv could win back lost territory. European leaders this week also discussed the thorny issue of future funding for the country, which is a bugbear for Trump. The leaders said "positive progress" had been made on using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine's post-war reconstruction, although such a move faces hurdles and opposition from some countries in the EU. Trump appeared unmoved by Europe's diplomatic efforts, of late. When Politico asked him whether Europe could help end the war, he said: "They talk but they don't produce. There's no doubt that Trump has a checkered relationship with Europe and its leaders, appearing to get on well with some — such as the U.K. and Italy's Prime Ministers Keir Starmer and Giorgia Meloni, and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte— but not so much with others. Trump has had something of an awkward "frenemy" relationship with French President Emmanuel Macron who he has both praised and criticized, and he has no natural rapport with the serious German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Trump also appears to have a strained relationship with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Belittling his political foes is nothing new for Trump, but what's shocking for Europe is that he appears willing to relinquish longstanding friends and tested alliances that have been in place since World War II. Europe was already put on notice last week when Trump's new national security strategy stated that Europe risked "civilizational erasure" within the next 20 years and questioned whether European countries can "remain reliable allies." In turn, it said Washington should reestablish strategic stability with Russia. The security strategy signals a seismic shift in U.S.-European relations, analysts say, and should be a wake-up call for Europe. "Trump's worldview is clear" in the new U.S. national security document, Ian Bremmer, founder and president of Eurasia Group, commented Tuesday: That should make every NATO capital sit up straight," he said in comments on social media platform X. "President Trump believes a strong Europe is not in the U.S.' interests, particularly a strong, coordinated Europe. He does not like the European Union ... His issue is that the EU, together, has the ability to tell Trump things that he doesn't like to hear," Bremmer added. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ghana has issued a firm protest to Israel after several of its nationals were detained and deported at Ben Gurion International Airport, a development that has sharpened diplomatic unease but falls short of any formal rupture in relations. In a statement released in Accra, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was appalled by what it described as the unjustifiable and humiliating treatment of Ghanaian travellers. According to the ministry, seven citizens, including four members of a parliamentary delegation attending an international cybersecurity conference in Tel Aviv, were detained on Sunday, December 7, and released only after more than five hours of diplomatic intervention. Three others were deported to Ghana on the next available flight. Officials in Accra say the pattern suggests that Ghanaian travellers were deliberately targeted and subjected to inhumane treatment. However, the airport episode adds to a set of existing disagreements that have quietly shaped their recent interactions. Ghana initially expressed strong support for Israel after the October 7 attack. Still, more recent criticism of Israeli military operations in Gaza, including remarks by some Ghanaian officials describing the actions as genocidal, has generated debate at home and possible diplomatic strain abroad. Israel has also taken issue with Ghana's voting patterns at the United Nations, where Accra often aligns with the wider African bloc on resolutions concerning Israel. The Israeli ambassador to Ghana has publicly stated that a visa-free arrangement is unlikely in the near term due to concerns about some Ghanaians overstaying their visas. The two countries have navigated periods of tension before, most notably in 1973 when Ghana, alongside many African states, severed ties after the Yom Kippur War and an OAU resolution. Diplomatic relations were later restored and have since grown into a steady partnership. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will summon Israeli embassy officials to register its displeasure and is weighing possible reciprocal measures. As both governments reaffirm their desire for deeper cooperation, the handling of this dispute may determine how resilient the partnership remains in an increasingly complex geopolitical environment.

Silver blew past $60 per troy ounce for the first time on Tuesday, extending its blistering rally as traders race into a metal increasingly linked to the build-out of AI infrastructure. The milestone caps a stunning run in 2025: silver has more than doubled this year, far outpacing gold's roughly 60% gain and leaving many traditional commodity forecasts in the dust. While expectations of further Federal Reserve easing have helped fuel the move, surging industrial demand and persistent supply tightness are also powering silver's fierce price gains. Veteran Wall Street strategist Ed Yardeni wrote on Tuesday that silver's explosive rally can't be understood without acknowledging its growing importance to the AI economy. Industry association The Silver Institute and Oxford Economics reinforced that view in a report released on Tuesday, saying AI's rapid expansion is helping drive growing demand for silver across digital economy applications. Beyond AI demand, silver remains entrenched in a tight market, with inventories strained and borrowing rates still high despite some easing after October's historic squeeze. "This is unquestionably a tight market, stocks are falling, and traders want whatever scraps of silver they can get their hands on," wrote Chris Weston, the head of research at Pepperstone, in a Tuesday note. He added that retail traders are taking sharp notice of silver's surge, and for good reason. "It is an emphatic move, with trend and momentum accounts absolutely bossing the show," wrote Weston. Despite its red-hot rally, the silver trade remains a risky one, Goldman Sachs cautioned in October. Silver is far more cyclical because of its heavy industrial use, making it a less reliable hedge than gold, the bank said.</p>
