            The daughter of Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado spoke of the country's fight for democracy as she accepted this year's Nobel Peace Prize in Norway on behalf of her mother, who was unable to attend the event.
    


            The Nobel Peace Prize laureate had been expected to attend Wednesday's acceptance ceremony in Oslo, in defiance of a decade-long travel ban placed on her. She has been in hiding since last year, resurfacing only briefly at a protest in January against President Nicolás Maduro being sworn in after a disputed election.
    


            Organisers of the ceremony on Wednesday said Machado was “safe” and was expected to arrive in Oslo in the near future. They added that she had “done everything in her power to attend today's ceremony” but that “her journey involved extreme danger.”
    


            Maduro's government has warned she would be considered a “fugitive” by authorities should she leave Venezuela.
    


            In an audio recording released by the Norwegian Nobel Institute before the ceremony, Machado, 58, said, “I am on my way to Oslo right now.” She thanked those who had “risked their lives” for her to travel to Norway.
    


            Machado's representatives said earlier on Wednesday that, despite being  unable to attend the Nobel ceremony, they were “optimistic about her participation in the rest of the day's events.”
    


            Machado received the peace prize in October for tirelessly promoting democratic rights in Venezuela and “for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,” the Norwegian Nobel Committee said. But Venezuela's government condemned the move, accusing her of encouraging violence and collaborating with foreign powers.
    


            Her daughter, Ana Corina Sosa Machado, 34, said the prize carried profound meaning, reminding the world that democracy is “essential” to peace. She spoke of her hope that Venezuela would make an “orderly transition” to democracy.
    


            “We will see grandmothers settle children on their laps to tell them stories not of distant forefathers, but of their own parents' courage.”
    


            “And more than anything, what we Venezuelans can offer the world is the lesson forged through this long and difficult journey: that to have democracy, we must be willing to fight for freedom,” she said.
    


            Venezuelan free-to-air TV channels did not show the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony. Instead, several channels aligned with the government carried a statement from Maduro from Tuesday night in which he “thanked the people of Oslo for protesting” the award and for “standing with Venezuela.”
    


            Machado has described her life's work as promoting “ballots over bullets.” Born in the Venezuelan capital Caracas in 1967, she trained as an industrial engineer before getting involved in politics.
    


            In 2002, she founded Súmate, a volunteer group that promotes political rights and monitors elections. She gained widespread attention in 2004 after participating in a failed effort to recall Venezuela's then-President Hugo Chávez.
    


            Machado was voted into the National Assembly in 2010. In 2012, she founded the Vente Venezuela political party and movement. Her platform included an economic model based on a free market, private property and respect for the rule of law.
    


            Machado was among opposition figures in 2014 calling for a wave of protests against Maduro, who became president after Chávez's death. During these protests, at least 43 people died, 486 were injured and 1,854 were arrested, according to the country's Attorney General's Office.
    


            In March of that year, Machado spoke at the Organization of American States to denounce the government for allegedly committing human rights violations during the protests. In response, the ruling party removed her from the National Assembly, accusing her of treason and later of plotting assassinations, which she denied.



 Last year, she attempted to run against Maduro in the country's presidential election, but her candidacy was voided by the regime. She then switched her support to the party of fellow opposition figure Edmundo González Urrutia. When government-aligned electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner, Venezuela's opposition forces cried foul, saying they had evidence to prove González had won.
    


            After US President Donald Trump returned to the White House in 2025, the US launched a major pressure campaign against Maduro, amassing more than a dozen warships and thousands of troops off Venezuela's Caribbean shores. The Pentagon says it's part of a mission to disrupt drug trafficking from Latin America, but the Venezuelan government claims the move is aimed at driving Maduro out of power.
    


            Machado welcomed the US pressure and has tried to build on it by rallying national and international support.
    


            Last month, she published what she described as a freedom manifesto, in which she outlined her vision of a new Venezuela without Maduro.

            The US Navy has recovered two aircraft that crashed into the South China Sea in October while flying off the USS Nimitz, the service said in a statement Tuesday.
    


            An unmanned system on a contracted vessel was used to lift the aircraft – an F/A-18 Hornet fighter jet and MH-60 helicopter – from a depth of 400 feet (122 meters) on December 5, the Navy said.
    


            While neither are the most modern of the Navy's aircraft, experts say the wrecks could have yielded useful intelligence if they had fallen into the hands of an adversary.
    


            “Everyone involved brought critical expertise ensuring we could safely and successfully bring these aircraft back under US custody,” Lt. Cmdr. Christopher Andersen, the officer in charge of the salvage mission, said in a statement.
    


            Bracketed by China and several Southeast Asian nations, parts of the vital South China Sea are claimed by multiple governments, but Beijing asserts ownership over almost all of the strategic waterway, in defiance of an international court ruling.
    


            Over the past two decades, China has fortified its territorial claims by constructing military installations on contested islands and reefs. The US says China's assertions and military buildup threaten freedom of navigation and free trade.
    


            US forces maintain a steady presence in the region to push back on Chinese sovereignty claims and support Washington's allies and partners.
    


            The two aircraft crashed within 30 minutes of each other during routine operations off the aircraft carrier in late October.
    


            No official cause has been given for the crashes, but US President Donald Trump suggested to reporters shortly after the incidents that contaminated fuel may have been to blame. All crew members were rescued.
    


            The Navy's statement Tuesday said an investigation into the crashes was continuing.
    


            “All recovered aircraft components are being transported to a designated U.S. military installation in the Indo-Pacific region for detailed analysis,” the Navy said in a statement.
    


            The latest recovery effort follows a similar mission in 2022, when an F-35 jet, the Navy's most advanced fighter, crashed while attempting to land on the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson.
    


            The F-35 was eventually pulled up from under 12,400 feet (3,700 meters) of water by a Navy recovery team.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Africa has thousands of languages. Can AI be trained on all of them?","https://www.cnn.com/world/africa/african-languages-ai-spc","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 11:40:20 GMT","


            How do you teach somebody to read a language if there's nothing for them to read? This is the problem facing developers across the African continent who are trying to train AI to understand and respond to prompts in local languages.
    


            To train a language model, you need data. For a language like English, the easily accessible articles, books and manuals on the internet give developers a ready supply. But for most of Africa's languages — of which there are estimated to be between 1,500 and 3,000 — there are few written resources available. Vukosi Marivate, a professor of computer science at the University of Pretoria, in South Africa, uses the number of available Wikipedia articles to illustrate the amount of available data. For English, there are over 7 million articles. Tigrinya, spoken by around 9 million people in Ethiopia and Eritrea, has 335. For Akan, the most widely spoken native language in Ghana, there are none.
    


            Of those thousands of languages, only 42 are currently supported on a language model. Of Africa's 23 scripts and alphabets, only three — Latin, Arabic and Ge'Ez (used in the Horn of Africa) — are available. This underdevelopment “comes from a financial standpoint,” says Chinasa T. Okolo, the founder of Technēculturǎ, a research institute working to advance global equity in AI. “Even though there are more Swahili speakers than Finnish speakers, Finland is a better market for companies like Apple and Google.”
    


            If more language models are not developed, the impact across the continent could be dire, Okolo warns. “We're going to continue to see people locked out of opportunity,” she told CNN. As the continent looks to develop its own AI infrastructure and capabilities, those who do not speak one of these 42 languages risk being left behind.
    


            To avoid this, Okolo says AI developers across the continent “have to reenvision the way that we undertake model development in the first place.”
    


            This is what Marivate has done. Marivate led the South African arm of the African Next Voices project, which has made recordings of 18 languages in South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria. Over two years, the three teams collected 9,000 hours of recordings from people of different ages and locations, creating a data set which will be available for AI developers across the continent to use to train models.
    


            The researchers would sometimes give native speakers scripts to read, but mostly gave them a prompt and recorded their responses, which were then transcribed. For Isindebele, spoken in South Africa and Zimbabwe, they had such a hard time finding written resources that they resorted to a government manual for goat herders to help write their prompts.
    


            African Next Voices has not collected enough data to train a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT or Gemini, which can cover thousands of topics in detail. However, Marivate says they focused their recordings on specific topics, such as health and agriculture, that were deemed the most important.
    


            Using a small data set to make a generalized model would lead to a high error rate, but small, focused data sets can be highly accurate within the limited scope of a specialized model, explained Nyalleng Moorosi, a research fellow at the Distributed AI Research Institute (DAIR), who's not affiliated with the African Next Voices project.
    


            For her, it's a question of “prioritizing error.” “If somebody just wants to find out what's happening in downtown Nairobi, I can tolerate errors there,” Moorosi said, but mistakes in models that deal with topics like banking or health care could have serious consequences.
    


            “We need to make sure that the people who build these models understand the consequences, they understand the cultures enough to understand the weight of these errors,” Moorosi told CNN.
    


            Words and symbols, she says, have multiple meanings. The St George's cross, for example, has associations with right wing politics in the UK which are not obvious to someone from Ghana or Lesotho. This problem is particularly prevalent with low resource languages. “There's a lot of contextual knowledge, there is little documentation,” she says.
    


            A study by DAIR found that social media websites had failed to recognize and remove hate speech related to ethnic violence in Ethiopia in part because automated systems and human moderators were not familiar with the slang terms being used.
    


            Moorosi says that without this cultural understanding, it is impossible to make “AI systems perform and make judgments that are aligned to our beliefs and values.”
    


            Although many Africans speak multiple languages, including the African and European languages that are already supported by language models, Moorosi, believes that the aim should be to make AI accessible in all languages, “even for languages that have one speaker. All languages deserve representation or preservation.”
    


            However, a lack of data is not the only challenge facing African AI developers. Most African languages are not codified through dictionaries or grammatical studies. In Kinyarwanda, the language of Rwanda, there are three common ways of spelling the name of the country: uRwanda, Urwanda, and u Rwanda. Without rules for spellings, even the most basic text processing becomes difficult.
    


            Another issue is the lack of data centers. The African Union warned in 2024 that only 10% of the continent's data center demand was being met, presenting a bottleneck for Africa's AI hopes.
    


            The worry, for Marivate, is that if models are not made for these smaller languages, they will “disappear.” When it comes to developers creating data sets for languages that might not even have writing systems, “the model is going to have to change” he adds.
    


            The African Next Voices project has only just finished collecting and transcribing its data. Marivate says it is currently not working on new languages, but he is already thinking about which could be next.

US President Donald Trump is the only Western leader who comprehends the real reasons for the Ukraine conflict, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said.

Addressing Russia's Federation Council, the upper chamber of parliament, on Wednesday, Lavrov said that while the US is “showing growing impatience” with the diplomatic process aimed at ending the hostilities, Trump is one of the few in the West who know what led to the conflict in the first place.

“President Trump… is the only one among all Western leaders who, immediately after arriving in the White House in January of this year, began to demonstrate an understanding of the reasons the war in Ukraine had been inevitable,” he said.

Lavrov added that Trump “has a clear understanding” of the factors that shaped the hostile policies pursued toward Russia by the West and by former US President Joe Biden, which, he said, “had been nurtured for many years.”

Lavrov said that “the culmination of the entire [Ukraine] saga is approaching,” arguing that Trump had effectively acknowledged that “the root causes [of the conflict] identified by Russia must be eliminated.” 

He cited, in particular, Moscow's long-standing objections to Ukraine's NATO aspirations and the ongoing crackdown on the local population's rights.

The minister added that Trump remained “the only Western leader who cares about human rights in this situation,” contrasting him with EU governments that Moscow sees as evasive on the issue. He revealed that the proposed US roadmap for a settlement explicitly called for safeguarding national minority rights and religious freedoms in Ukraine, “in line with international obligations.”

According to Lavrov, however, those provisions were diluted once the document was presented to the EU. He claimed that the relevant language was rewritten to state that Ukraine should instead follow standards “adopted in the European Union.”

Moscow has for years raised alarms over Kiev's crackdown on the Russian language and culture, as well as attempts to suppress the rights of other national authorities, while pointing out that Ukrainian policymakers are openly encouraging neo-Nazism in the country.

Russia is seeking a durable, legally binding peace agreement with Ukraine rather than a limited ceasefire, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday. His remarks came after Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky proposed a moratorium on energy strikes as the country faces worsening power outages.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Peskov weighed in on Zelensky's signal that Kiev was prepared to discuss a halt to energy-related attacks, which he said “is important for the people.”

According to Peskov, Russia remains focused on reaching a legally binding settlement rather than a temporary pause. “I'll leave out some nuances, but we are working on peace, not on a ceasefire. A stable, guaranteed, long-term peace, achieved through the signing of appropriate documents, is an absolute priority,” the spokesman stressed.

In March, Russia and Ukraine agreed to a 30-day energy infrastructure ceasefire, which was reached after a phone call between President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Donald Trump. Russian officials, however, accused Ukraine of constantly violating the truce, including by targeting oil refineries and other energy facilities. Moscow said at the time that it had opted not to retaliate as a goodwill gesture toward the US and its mediation efforts.

Zelensky's latest proposal comes as Russia has targeted Ukraine's military and energy infrastructure in recent weeks, prompting officials in Kiev to impose rolling blackouts.

Moscow has said the strikes are in response to Ukrainian “terrorist acts” deep into Russia, targeting critical infrastructure and residential areas. Russia maintains that its forces never target civilians and strike only military-related facilities.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has cited India as an example of preserving “unity in diversity” in the age of artificial intelligence.

Countries like Russia and India should attach importance to their cultural variety, he told the annual meeting of the Council for Civil Society and Human Rights via video conference on Tuesday.

“I was just in India, there are one and a half billion people,” Putin said. “But only one-third speaks Hindi, maybe 500 million, maybe 600, and everyone else speaks other languages, and often they don't understand one another.”

Nothing the similarities between the nations, the Russian leader added, “So for massive and huge countries like ours and India, who are civilization-states, this is critically important. This unity and diversity or rather unity in diversity is something that we must preserve.”

Putin welcomed the idea of a state program to support languages in Russia.

“As for the languages, there are 270 [languages in Russia]. I don't even know, it's actually difficult to count, if we talk about some nuances. But the idea is very good – to use artificial intelligence to support language models,” he said.

Russia and India signed more than a dozen bilateral agreements affecting the media, space, and pharma sectors during Putin's visit last week.

Moscow wants “multifaceted relations” with New Delhi in various sectors, the Russian president said during the visit.

RT India's English-language broadcast was also launched during Putin's trip.

RootsAction report finds Harris courted moderates instead of working-class Democrats – and Gaza stance did not help

Kamala Harris lost last year's US presidential election because she chased the wrong voters with the wrong message, ultimately demobilising the very base that she needed to win, according to an autopsy by a progressive grassroots advocacy group.

The vice-president focused on courting moderate Republicans over motivating core Democratic working-class, young and progressive voters, a misstep compounded by her failure to break from Joe Biden on Gaza, says the report by RootsAction.

“To win back the White House and Congress, we urge the Democratic party to change course and embrace economic populist policies that inspire and help working-class Americans,” argues the autopsy. “The Democratic party must show voters that it has a spine and can stand up to corporate and big-money interests.”

The Democratic National Committee has not yet released its “after-action review” of the November 2024 election, in which Donald Trump won the national popular vote by 1.5% after having lost it to Biden by 4.5% in 2020. Trump won all seven major swing states, whereas Biden had won six of them in 2020.

Autopsy: How Democrats Lost the White House, authored by Christopher Cook and edited by Sam Rosenthal, says the pivotal factor was a massive drop in Democratic turnout: Harris received approximately 6.8m fewer votes than Biden did in 2020, while Trump gained about 2.8m votes.

For the first time since 2004, independent voters turned out in greater numbers than registered Democrats. Turnout plummeted in Democratic strongholds. A substantial drop-off in turnout and support among voters aged 18-29, who were disillusioned with the administration's policies, proved politically fatal.

RootsAction notes that Biden's initial decision to run for re-election despite low approval ratings and his late exit from the race left the Harris campaign with only 107 days and no primary process to build momentum. It saddled the nominee with an unpopular incumbent's record.

But the Harris campaign failed to inspire or mobilise millions of voters who had supported Biden in 2020 because of messaging that was out of touch with voters' economic anxieties.

It adopted “joyful” messaging and sunny talking points (“Bidenomics”) at a time when nearly 70% of voters rated the economy as “not so good” or “poor”. Harris also did not create distance from Biden, stating on The View that “not a thing comes to mind” that she would do differently from him.

Her campaign made a critical strategic error by prioritising an appeal to moderate, suburban Republicans over mobilising its core working-class and progressive base, leading to significant erosion of support among these vital constituencies. A strategy, articulated by Senator Chuck Schumer in 2016, of trading one blue-collar Democrat for “two moderate Republicans in the suburbs” was repeated and failed again.

This led to a catastrophic failure of outreach to the Democratic base. In Philadelphia, campaign organisers were reportedly told not to engage in basic get-out-the-vote activities in Black and Latino neighbourhoods, forcing staffers to form a “rogue” operation in the campaign's final days.

The campaign also heavily featured former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, focusing on themes of democracy while neglecting voters' more urgent economic concerns. This muddied the Democratic message and consumed valuable resources.

The autopsy notes that the Democratic party's long-term erosion of support among working-class voters accelerated into a collapse in 2024. According to AP Votecast, Trump won voters without a college degree by a 54% to 44% margin, a significant expansion from his 51% to 47% edge in 2020.

The Harris campaign's economic message was weakened by corporate influence, RootsAction argues. Advisers such as Uber executive Tony West and billionaire Mark Cuban steered the campaign away from bold populist proposals. A New York Times report noted the campaign adopted “marginal pro-business tweaks” that never “coalesced into a clear economic argument”.

As the election neared, progressive phrases such as “living wage” and “union jobs” dropped out of Harris's vocabulary, while she spent more time with Cheney and Cuban than with labour leaders like Shawn Fain.

Much of this echoed Democrat Hillary Clinton's mistakes when she lost to Trump in 2016. In an interview, Norman Solomon, the national director of RootsAction, described the parallels as “unnerving” and said: “In many respects the autopsy that we did for the Hillary Clinton campaign is very similar to the one that we're releasing now.

“It's not an exaggeration to say that if you were to interchange the names Clinton and Harris, sometimes it fits like a glove, and it's been a deterioration because Hillary Clinton didn't lose the working class per se, but Kamala Harris managed to do it.”

In addition, Harris's refusal to signal any meaningful shift from the Biden administration's deeply unpopular policy on Israel and Gaza alienated Arab American, Muslim, young and progressive voters, costing critical support in swing states.

In 2020, Biden won 59% of the Arab American vote. In 2024, polling showed Harris with just 41%, effectively tied with Trump's 42%. The campaign refused to give a speaking slot to a Palestinian American state representative, Ruwa Romman, at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

The strategy failed in Michigan, which Harris lost by 80,000 votes. In Dearborn, a city with a large Arab American population, Trump won 42%-40%, with Green Party candidate Jill Stein taking 15%. This was a reversal from 2020, when Biden won the city 69%-30%.

While the report holds the Democratic party primarily responsible, it acknowledges challenging external factors. Unprecedented spending by special interests, led by Elon Musk's $29m contribution, fuelled a social media machine that spread lies and disinformation about immigration, disaster relief and candidates.

As a woman of African American and Asian heritage, Harris was disadvantaged by voter biases of sexism and racism. However, the report concludes these were not the primary reasons for her defeat.

A pre-election report entitled Populism Wins Pennsylvania by the Center for Working-Class Politics and others found that “strong populist and progressive economic messages” dramatically outperformed messages about Trump's threat to democracy, especially among working-class voters.

RootsAction also argues that progressive economic policies passed by wide margins, even in deep-red states: Missouri and Alaska passed a $15 minimum wage; Nebraska, Missouri, and Alaska passed paid sick leave; seven states, including Arizona, Missouri, and Montana, approved constitutional rights to abortion.

The RootsAction report makes three core recommendations. First, it urges Democrats to embrace an agenda that includes enhanced Medicare for All, raising the federal minimum wage, robust union protections aggressive anti-trust enforcement and significantly higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy.

Second, it calls on the party to limit corporate campaign contributions and mount an aggressive challenge to the 2010 Citizens United supreme court decision that opened the floodgates for corporations and other outside groups to spend unlimited money on elections.

Third, the autopsy says Democrats should officially reject the influence of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) lobby group and realign US foreign policy away from unconditional support for Israel, arguing the previous stance is both “morally indefensible and politically suicidal”.

Solomon added that the Harris campaign and DNC leadership's motivations should be understood in a context of corporate donors and consultants who feel threatened when the status quo is challenged, for example by insurgents such as Senator Bernie Sanders.

He said: “The solution, much easier said than done, is to have a truly big tent, stop making young people feel unwelcome and, if you're gonna have a fight club, you need more fight and less club. The message of the autopsy is you can't have a truly big tent if the inner circle is perceived, quite correctly, as being pretty much closed.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The White House has formalised its contempt for ‘decaying' Europe with an ominous plan to undermine the EU and boost the far right

Don't get This Is Europe delivered to your inbox? Sign up here

Almost half of EU citizens regard Donald Trump as an enemy of Europe, a new survey across nine countries revealed last week. The poll, conducted for the French debate platform Le Grand Continent, found that across Europe, Trumpism is considered “a hostile force”.

The new US foreign policy doctrine published by the White House on Friday will have heightened these respondents' worst fears. The 30-page National Security Strategy landed like a bombshell in Europe. And citizens may have been out in front of their political leaders in figuring out what Trump's worldview could mean for Europeans.

The strategy outlines a radical shift away from the ethos underpinning the Atlantic alliance, the doctrine that has bound the US to Europe since the second world war. The US, now frames the EU – the continent's core political community – as a legitimate target for ideological warfare.

Its most astonishing pivot is a threat to meddle directly to “cultivate resistance” in Europe and restore the supposedly lost national sovereignties of the EU's ailing individual nations.

This is not just the familiar threat to withdraw troops or demand that Europe shells out more money for its own defence. It suggests that the Trump administration wants to help “patriotic” far-right parties to power, while legitimising racist conspiracy theories. It makes the extraordinary claim that Europe faces the risk of “civilisational erasure” if “non-European” immigration is allowed to continue.

For the Dutch political scientist Cas Mudde, an expert in the far right, this strategy means Europe must count the US from now on as “a willing adversary”. Writing in the Guardian, Mudde said: “Perhaps now that it is published in an official document, European leaders will finally understand that ‘daddy' is serious … The current US government believes that its national security is best served by the destruction of liberal democracy in Europe.”

Trump doubled down on Tuesday, using an interview with Politico to again lay into “decaying” European nations and their “politically correct” leaders whose immigration policies were “destroying” their countries. He complained about Paris and London in particular: the problem, as he viewed it was that the French and British capitals were becoming less white, or, wrote the Guardian's Peter Beaumont, that they are “not racist enough”.

Coercive consequences

The US military and political alliance with Europe is clearly in crisis.

In an opinion piece on Monday, Georg Riekeles and Varg Folkman predicted that Washington will, as it draws back militarily, pull harder on other coercive levers to reshape Europe in the political direction the US wants. Not just on trade, either: as Mudde also noted, this could mean the US demanding protection for far-right free speech.

One of the biggest questions to be asked, according to Paul Taylor of the European Policy Centre, is why there is such an unequivocal embrace of Russia but no mention of it as a threat. Is there a longer game involving pulling in Vladimir Putin to isolate China? Are influential US interests eyeing juicy business deals? Either way, the document was warmly welcomed by the Kremlin.

Yet, European governments' reaction (in public, at least) has been muted. Leaders have grovelled to Trump for so many months, desperate to keep him engaged in the defence of Ukraine – and to avoid any peace plan that won't harm their security, too (or provoke another trade war) – that they seem immobilised from speaking up. Germany's Friedrich Merz has gone the furthest, saying it underscored the need for a more independent European security policy.

The White House's efforts to bully Ukraine into a bad “peace” deal could be entering another treacherous phase. But Washington's priority is not – the strategy made clear – a European security architecture that shields Ukraine from future Russian invasion. It is an “expeditious cessation of hostilities” and the desire to “reestablish strategic stability with Russia”.

These words (coupled with the accusation that Europe is not interested in making peace with Putin) must have been the elephant in the room when Merz, Starmer and Emmanuel Macron hugged Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy close at Downing Street on Monday.

In his interview the following day, Trump again threatened to cut Ukraine adrift if Zelenskyy does not “play ball” in the talks. Europe has been sidelined from direct involvement in the US-led negotiations, yet it has helped Ukraine to hold the line against a dangerous Trump-Putin carve-up. Kyiv is now running out of money however so Europe must urgently find billions to keep Ukraine in the fight, either by using frozen Russian assets or joint borrowing.

Zelenskyy, meanwhile, desperate to avoid a transatlantic rift, has said he may be able to stage elections, in response to Trump's accusation that he is using the war to cling to power.

How should Europe respond?

This latest doctrine could form the basis of US international policy for the remaining years of Trump's term, and much longer if his vice-president, JD Vance, succeeds him.

Europe's democracies, as a wide range of analysts told Jon Henley, need urgently to develop a counter-plan both to save Ukraine and future-proof their liberal democracies from Maga-inspired interference. Merely hoping that Trump's embrace drives a wedge between Europe's leading far rlght parties is a risky strategy. As Timothy Garton Ash implored of the continent's leaders in this column: “How much more clarity do you need?”

Nathalie Tocci, director of the Italian Institute for International Affairs, believes that Europe has the means to stand on its own, even in the short-term, to defend Ukraine. “Europe can prevent Kyiv's capitulation, if we jolt ourselves out of our learned helplessness and stop sucking up to Trump. It'll be tough but we can do it.”

Being heard to stand up to Trump right now might even put Europe's centrist leaders in good stead with their anxious voters. Le Grand Continent's survey also showed that 51% of Europeans believed, even before Putin's chilling statement last week about being “ready for war right now with Europe”, that they too are in Moscow's crosshairs.

Italian cooking added to ‘intangible cultural heritage' list after campaign by Giorgia Meloni's far-right government

Unesco has officially recognised Italian cooking as a cultural beacon, an endorsement hailed by the far-right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, whose government has put the country's food at the heart of its nationalistic expression of identity.

The announcement, made on Wednesday during the UN cultural body's assembly in Delhi, means Italian cuisine – from pasta and mozzarella to wine and tiramisu – will be inscribed on the coveted list of “intangible cultural heritage”.

Italy already has 21 other traditions on the list, including the art of Neapolitan pizza making and opera singing, and it is the first country to be recognised for its cuisine in its entirety rather than for a single tradition or recipe.

In a video message posted on her Instagram account within minutes of the announcement, Meloni said the news filled her with pride. “We are the first in the world to receive this recognition, which honours who we are and our identity,” she said. “For us Italians, cuisine is more than just food or a collection of recipes. It's much more than that: it's culture, tradition, work and wealth.”

Meloni's government got to work in pursuing the Unesco recognition soon after coming to power in October 2022, formally submitting its bid five months later. The bid emphasised the links between traditional Italian food, culture and lifestyle, describing it as a convivial social ritual that brings families and communities together.

The promotional campaign included an open-air Sunday lunch attended by Meloni and other government officials and their families at the Roman Forum in the Italian capital in September.

In its announcement, Unesco described Italian cuisine as a “cultural and social blend of culinary traditions” and a way of “caring for oneself and others, expressing love and rediscovering one's cultural roots” while offering communities an outlet “to share their history and describe the world around them”.

It added: “It is a communal activity that emphasises intimacy with food, respect for ingredients and shared moments around the table … People of all ages and genders participate, exchanging recipes, suggestions and stories, with grandparents often passing down traditional dishes to their grandchildren.”

Italy's agriculture minister, Francesco Lollobrigida, who often decries any tinkering with Italian food classics, said the victory was “a celebration that belongs to everyone because it speaks to our roots, our creativity and our ability to transform tradition into reality”.

Meanwhile, a report published by Rome's Sapienza University on Wednesday said Unesco world heritage recognition of various Italian locations and traditions, including the prosecco hills in Veneto and the Sicilian island of Pantelleria, known for its bush vine cultivation, had worked wonders for tourism and that now Italian cuisine was on the list, more visitors were expected.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Taiwan has inched closer to becoming a super-aged society as nearly 20 percent of the population is 65 or older, Ministry of the Interior data showed. 

The WHO defines a “super-aged society” as one in which 20 percent of the people are 65 or older. 

As of last month, the nation had about 4.65 million people aged 65 or older, accounting for 19.99 percent of the population. Meanwhile, 68.48 percent of people were aged 15 to 64, while 11.53 were 14 or younger.

Meanwhile, the number of elderly people in 14 administrative regions had exceeded 20 percent of the population, with the top five being Taipei (24.1 percent), Chiayi County (24.03 percent), Nantou County (22.6 percent), Keelung (22.18 percent) and Pingtung County (21.77 percent). 

Administrative regions with the lowest elderly population proportions were: Hsinchu County (15.02 percent), Hsinchu City (16.10 percent), Taoyuan (16.64 percent), Lienchiang (Matsu) County (17.06 percent), Taichung (17.32 percent), Kinmen County (19.63 percent), Chiayi City (19.86 percent) and New Taipei City (19.87 percent). 

The nation also saw a decline in total population and newborns, ministry data showed. 

The total population was 23,306,085 as of last month, down from 23,402,765 in November last year, a decline of 264.96 people per day on average. 

As of last month, the nation had 98,785 newborns this year, significantly fewer than the 134,856 reported for the whole of last year. 

The number of newborns in the nation decreased consecutively from 2015 to last year. 

Last month, 7,946 births were reported, bringing the crude birthrate to 4.15 per 1,000 population. It was also the third time this year that the number of monthly births fell to a historic low. 

A total of 14,771 died last month, bringing the crude death rate 7.71 per 1,000. 

The administrative regions with the highest crude birthrates were Yunlin County (6.25 per 1,000), Taitung County (5.08 per 1,000) and Hsinchu City (5 per 1,000). 

In addition, the three lowest crude birthrates were reported in Lienchiang County (1.78 per 1,000), Keelung (2.84 per 1,000) and Chiayi County (3.13 per 1,000). 

The nation's population last month dropped by 6,825 from the previous month. 

Meanwhile, 59,696 people were added to the household registration system last month, while 57,639 people were removed from the system, resulting in a net increase of 2,057. 

The highest net migration increases were recorded in Taichung (1,135), Taoyuan (953) and New Taipei City (710). 

The nation recorded a social increase — the number of people who moved to Taiwan minus the number of people who moved away — of 2,057 people.

More than 40 percent of legislative seats in Taiwan were held by women last year, the highest proportion of any country in Asia, the government said in its latest report on gender equality. 

Taiwan also ranked sixth globally and first in Asia in 2023 in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI). 

The Executive Yuan highlighted Taiwan's gender-equality status in its fifth national report on the nation's efforts to meet the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Cabinet's Gender Equality Committee said in a statement yesterday.

The UN passed the CEDAW in 1979 and promulgated it in 1981, requiring signatory countries to enact legislation, and take measures to eliminate discrimination against women and ensure equal rights between genders. 

Since 2009, Taiwan has published a national report on the CEDAW every four years to assess its progress on women's rights and gender equality. 

Although it is not a formal signatory to the agreement due to its exclusion from the UN, Taiwan in 2011 passed the Enforcement Act of Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (消除對婦女一切形式歧視公約施行法), making it part of the nation's legal framework. 

The Executive Yuan's Department of Gender Equality said Minister Without Portfolio Lin Ming-hsin (林明昕) on Nov. 25 chaired a meeting that approved the CEDAW report. 

The report details Taiwan's progress in promoting women's rights and advancing gender equality, Lin said during his presentation. 

It shows the world how the nation is moving closer to international human rights standards and working hard to ensure gender equality, he added. 

The report covers Taiwan's efforts from 2021 to last year to eliminate discrimination against women, improve their rights and work toward gender equality. 

Taiwan was ranked sixth globally and first in Asia in the OECD's 2023 SIGI, the report said. 

Taiwan leads Asia in gender equality, having passed marriage equality in 2019, and expanded protections for transnational marriages and adoption rights in 2023, it said. 

In addition, 41.6 percent of legislators last year were female, the highest ratio in Asia, it said. 

Taiwan has also passed measures to support women who want to have children, and provide more resources to help raise them, foster family-friendly workplaces, eliminate gender stereotypes, promote gender equality in education, and improve women's health services, the committee said. 

Taiwan in 2021 enacted the Stalking Harassment and Prevention Act (跟蹤騷擾防制法) and amended gender equality, sexual harassment and domestic violence prevention laws in the past four years, strengthening its system for preventing gender-based violence, it said. 

Taiwan is not a member of the UN, but its CEDAW review committee followed the UN's procedures to ensure a fair assessment, it said. 

The committee also announced that five international experts would travel to Taiwan in July to participate in the review of the report and offer advice, joined by Taiwanese experts and civil society groups.

Reuters

11:43 JST, December 10, 2025

SYDNEY, Dec 10 (Reuters) – Australia on Wednesday became the first country to ban social media for children under 16, blocking access to platforms including TikTok, Alphabet's GOOGL.O YouTube and Meta's META.O Instagram and Facebook.

Ten of the biggest platforms were ordered to block children from midnight (1300 GMT on Tuesday) or face fines of up to A$49.5 million ($33 million) under the new law, which drew criticism from major technology companies and free speech advocates, but was welcomed by many parents and child advocates.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called it “a proud day” for families and cast the law as proof that policymakers can curb online harms that have outpaced traditional safeguards.

“This will make an enormous difference. It is one of the biggest social and cultural changes that our nation has faced,” Albanese told a news conference on Wednesday.

“It's a profound reform which will continue to reverberate around the world.”

In a video message, Albanese urged children to “start a new sport, new instrument, or read that book that has been sitting there for some time on your shelf,” ahead of Australia's summer school break starting later this month.

In the hours before the ban took effect, many of the estimated one million children impacted by the legislation began posting messages saying goodbye to their online followers.

“No more social media… no more contact with the rest of the world,” wrote one teen on TikTok.

“#seeyouwhenim16,” said another.

The rollout caps a year of debate over whether any country could practically stop children from using platforms embedded in daily life, and begins a live test for governments worldwide frustrated that social media firms have been slow to implement harm-reduction measures.

Albanese's center-left government proposed the landmark law citing research showing harms to mental health from the overuse of social media among young teens, including misinformation, bullying and harmful depictions of body image.

Several countries from Denmark to New Zealand to Malaysia have signaled they may study or emulate Australia's model, making the country a test case for how far governments can push age-gating without stifling speech or innovation.

Elon Musk's X became the last of the 10 major platforms to take measures to cut off access to underage teens after publicly acknowledging on Wednesday that it would comply.

“It's not our choice – it's what the Australian law requires,” X said on its website.

“X automatically offboards anyone who does not meet our age requirements.”

Australia has said the initial list of covered platforms would change as new products emerge and young users migrate.

Companies have told Canberra they will deploy a mix of age inference – estimating a user's age from their behavior – and age estimation based on a selfie, alongside checks that could include uploaded identification documents or linked bank account details.

For social media businesses, the implementation marks a new era of structural stagnation as user numbers flatline and time spent on platforms shrinks, studies show.

Platforms say they earn little from advertising to under-16s, but warn the ban disrupts a pipeline of future users. Just before the ban took effect, 86% of Australians aged eight to 15 used social media, the government said.

Some youngsters have warned the social media ban could isolate people.

“It's going to be worse for queer people and people with niche interests I guess because that's the only way they can find their community,” said 14-year-old Annie Wang ahead of the ban.

“Some people also use it to vent their feelings and talk to people to get help … So I feel like it'll be fine for some people, but for some people it'll worsen their mental health.”

This is Jared Goyette, reporting from a festive but tired Kyiv on day 1,386 of Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the War Desk, our focus continues to be on Myrnohrad — with conflicting information about whether Ukrainian troops there are ""encircled"" and how safely they can rotate personnel and bring in supplies.

Top story so far:

Ukrainian troops defending the front-line city of Myrnohrad in Donetsk Oblast are relying on a narrow and increasingly dangerous ""gray zone"" corridor to move in and out of the city as Russian forces try to cut the last remaining roads, Ukrainska Pravda reported.

Two servicemen fighting in the area told Ukrainska Pravda journalist Olga Kyrylenko that all usable routes into and out of Myrnohrad are under constant Russian fire.

The last remaining exit from Myrnohrad is described as a ""strip of gray zone"" only a couple of kilometers (about 1 mile) wide between the partially occupied village of Rivne and the occupied village of Krasnyi Lyman.  Soldiers say Ukrainian brigades are taking losses as they try to rotate personnel and maintain supplies, Kyrylenko reported.

Russian forces are also increasing their presence inside Myrnohrad, while Ukrainian troops have fewer reconnaissance tools left to assess the buildup, according to the report. 

This comes a week after a Dec. 3 report in the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske in which soldiers on the ground said Myrnohrad was practically encircled, with one unnamed commander in the 38th Marine Brigade saying that Myrnohrad had been encircled on the ground for the last five days, while another source told the outlet that the last successful rotation was on Nov. 12.

These reports appear to contrast with comments by Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi at a Dec. 9 press briefing, where he said that Myrnohrad ""is not surrounded,"" although he acknowledged that logistics had become more difficult.

At the same briefing, Syrskyi said Ukraine had regained about 13 square kilometers (5 square miles) of Pokrovsk's roughly 29 square kilometers (11 square miles) since mid-November after previously having no troops left in the city. Ukrainian forces also withdrew from positions 5 to 7 kilometers (3 to 4 miles) outside Pokrovsk that could no longer be held effectively, he said.

Last updated 3:22 p.m. Kyiv time.

Ukraine on Dec. 10 denied Russia had captured the town of Siversk, Donetsk Oblast, insisting fighting was ongoing.

""(Russia's) attempts to install flags in the city buildings to create a propaganda image are ending in losses for the occupiers,"" Ukraine's Operational Command East said, in comments reported by Suspilne.

Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine's counter-disinformation center, echoed the statement.

""The Russians do not control Siversk, and as in most cases, their propagandists call the entry of assault groups into the city control. But this is not true. The fighting continues,""

Siversk has been blocking Russian advances toward the larger urban cluster of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk to the west.

Military analysts say that if Russia consolidates gains around Siversk, it could increase pressure on that defensive line by opening up new avenues of attack.

Despite the denials of capture, the situation for Ukraine in Siversk is bleak.

""The enemy continues to drag its infantry into the city and currently the situation is not developing in the best way, because Siversk is gradually falling into the hands of the enemy,"" Ukrainian open-source mapping project DeepState, said on Dec. 9.

Last updated 2:05 p.m. Kyiv time.

Ukraine's Special Operations Forces released on Dec. 10 video of what it said was a combat mission in Donetsk Oblast during which a five-strong Russian infiltration group were killed.

""Operators of the 8th Regiment of the Special Operations Forces of Ukraine during special operations in the forest area of ​​the Donetsk Oblast successfully destroyed five Russian servicemen,"" the SSO said in a post on social media.

""Taking advantage of the weather conditions, the enemy wanted to infiltrate the rear of Ukrainian positions, but the SSO prevented them from doing so.""

The footage shows a firefight in a forested area with what appear to be thermal imaging gun sights picking out and shooting Russian soldiers.

In a response both to Ukraine's mostly-effective drone-based kill zone and the growing holes in Kyiv's lines, Russia has almost completely shifted to using small group infantry assault tactics' rather than large-scale mechanized attacks with tanks and other heavy armor.

Moving forward in groups of one to three soldiers, and with an emphasis on camouflage, these Russian assault teams are often not ordered to assault the first Ukrainian positions they come across, as would be expected in a traditional positional engagement.

Instead, they often infiltrate further, looking to attack Ukrainian drone teams and cause overall chaos, creating sectors where both sides' infantry find themselves holding positions behind each other's lines.

At least three people have been killed and 17 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities reported on Dec. 10.

Russia launched 80 drones at Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 50 drones. Twenty-nine drones made it through, striking seven locations

In Kharkiv Oblast, Russian attacks targeted three settlements, injuring one person over the past day, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov.

In Donetsk Oblast, Russian strikes injured one person, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin.

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian drones attacked Kryvyi Rih, killing one person, and Nikopol, injuring two others, Vladyslav Haivanenko reported.

In Sumy Oblast, two men were killed by Russian first-person view (FPV) drones and one woman was injured in two separate attacks, according to the local military administration.

In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian attacks injured three people, the local military administration reported.

In Kherson Oblast, Russian strikes injured nine people over the past day, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.

Russia has lost around 1,183,620 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Dec. 10.

The number includes 1,010 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,404 tanks, 23,692 armored fighting vehicles, 69,182 vehicles and fuel tanks, 34,969 artillery systems, 1,563 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,253 air defense systems, 431 airplanes, 347 helicopters, 89,066 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.

A Kyiv court placed Anti-Corruption Bureau's detective Viktor Husarov on house arrest on Dec. 9, freeing him from custody five months after his arrest.

The detective is charged with treason for allegedly passing state secrets to an associate who is said to be working with Russia.

Husarov, and the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) Head Semen Kryvonos have alleged that the detective was deliberately held in custody to pressure the anti-corruption bureau and hinder its work. Both denied that the detective had been working for Russia.

Back in July, Ukraine's Security Service arrested two detectives with the country's independent anti-corruption bureau, effectively launching a government-sponsored attack on anti-graft institutions.

The attack failed following popular pushback. Five months later, the two detectives returned home.

Mahamedrasulov, the other NABU detective kept behind bars, had been investigating the country's largest corruption case involving the state-run nuclear power monopoly Energoatom. He was freed last week.

The corruption probe centered around the state nuclear power company Energoatom turned into one of Ukraine's largest political scandals on record.

The alleged ringleader was Timur Mindich, a close associate of President Volodymyr Zelensky and a co-owner of the president's Kvartal 95 production company. Mindich was tipped off and left the country prior to being charged.

Others implicated include former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov, Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko, who served as energy minister earlier this year, and Rustem Umerov, former defense minister and current secretary of the National Security and Defense Council.

Mahamedrasulov's release came just days after Andriy Yermak was dismissed from his position as head of the President's Office, following NABU searches in his office.

Yermak's far-reaching powers and desire for control have been widely discussed among Ukrainian and foreign officials. Those who spoke with the Kyiv Independent have said that it was Yermak who pulled the trigger on the July attack against the country's anti-corruption institutions.

The Anti-Corruption Bureau is yet to say whether Yermak has been implicated in the Energoatom case.

""Undoubtedly, (the release of Mahamedrasulov) is good news. The bad non-news, however, is that the case of detective Mahamedrasulov is a diagnosis for (Ukraine's) law enforcement system,"" Anastasia Radina, head of the parliament's anti-corruption committee, said on Facebook.

""The entire system is deeply flawed and requires urgent intervention, primarily through legislative changes.""

Prosecutor General Ruslan Kravchenko responded to public criticism on Dec. 4, describing the reaction to the case as ""emotional"" and ""manipulative."" He said that Mahamedrasulov and his father had been charged due to the ""sufficient"" evidence presented by investigators. They were freed from custody as the risk of obstructing the investigation decreased, the Prosecutor General added.

""This decision was made not on social media, but within the framework of the criminal process,"" he said.

Kravchenko, who is seen as Zelensky's loyalist, said that easing the preventive measure ""is not a justification for the suspects,"" and the investigation continues.

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Dec. 10 named the British soldier killed during a weapons test in Ukraine as 28-year-old Lance Corporal George Hooley of the Parachute Regiment.

Canada's fertilizer giants risk becoming the target of a U.S. price-fixing investigation as the Trump administration tries to tackle high input prices and low profits on American farms.

On Monday, Mr. Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Canadian fertilizer imports, while accusing foreign companies of anti-competitive behaviour and price fixing. The President has launched a Department of Justice probe examining the matter.

One Canadian company – Saskatchewan-based Nutrien Ltd. – is the largest global producer of potash. Potash is one of three fertilizers critical to all major agricultural operations and the U.S. depends on Canada for more than 80 per cent of its demand. 

Mr. Trump's accusations are misplaced, especially when it comes to potash, analysts and fertilizer industry associations say, but they tap into a real problem unfolding on the American farm. 

U.S. eyes high tariffs on Canadian fertilizer, subsidies for farmers

Ottawa, Nutrien to meet to discuss building $1-billion potash export facility in Canada

On Monday, The White House announced US$12-billion in aid for farmers who have faced steep losses this year because of his administration's trade policy. These funds are unlikely to cover the total costs. They also will not address the problem of farm input costs – the largest of which is fertilizer – outstripping farm revenue. 

In 2025, China didn't buy U.S. soybeans until late October, months into harvest. Soybeans are one of the U.S.'s top agricultural exports, and China has historically been its largest market. The market closed because of the Trump administration's trade war with the Asian giant. 

Despite sales resuming at the end of October, total soybean sales to all destinations through early November were 40 per cent lower than the same period a year earlier, according to data from the United States Department of Agriculture. 

The “Farmer Bridge Assistance Program” announced Monday is intended to help farmers market this year's harvest and plan for next year's crop. It has earmarked US$11-billion for row crop farmers. 

But this won't cover US$15-billion in nationwide losses accrued from trade war, and mounting input costs. 

Fertilizer is one of the most costly inputs for a farm, accounting for more than 35 per cent of all operating costs for corn and wheat producers between 2006 and 2023. The three essential fertilizers are nitrogen, phosphate and potash. 

The event that supercharged fertilizer prices was Russia's invasion of Ukraine, said Veronica Nigh, chief economist at the Fertilizer Institute. Russia is the largest fertilizer producer in the world. 

In 2021, China also imposed export restrictions on phosphate and cut shipments by 40 per cent. China supplies around 40 per cent of global processed phosphate. 

The costs have since come down from peaks in 2021 however have not fallen at the same rate as crop prices. Continued geopolitical instability has driven volatility. For example, Iran and Egypt are major exporters of urea (a nitrogen fertilizer), and conflict in the Middle East disrupted supply chains and forced prices high, Ms. Nigh said. 

As a result of these low crop prices and high inputs, this year farmers across the U.S. are expected to lose on average US$150 per acre, with total nationwide losses eclipsing US$15-billion, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. The USDA also expects these costs to stay at elevated levels going into 2026. 

According to a statement from the American Soybean Association, this perfect storm of low crop prices, high production costs and loss of markets will lead to the longest stretch of substantial production losses for farmers of the crop in two decades. 

While more competition would be a good thing in the fertilizer sector, which is consolidated, price fixing is unlikely to be happening, said Josh Linville, vice-president of fertilizer at StoneX, a financial services company. Global commodity prices respond to global demand. 

Mr. Trump's focus on Canadian potash is also especially misplaced, he said. Nitrogen and phosphate prices are substantially higher. Potash has remained fairly stable over the past year. Supply is matching demand. 

Sovereign fertilizer production would be good for farmers, Ms. Nigh said, noting the geopolitical instability of the past five years. Growth has stalled across the sector in the past three years, she said. This is largely because of permitting challenges. 

But nitrogen and phosphate would be a better focus for growth than potash, Ms. Nigh said. In 2024, the U.S. produced 14,000 tonnes of nitrogen, 5,734 tonnes of phosphate and just 420 tonnes of potash. 

Potash production is tied to geography and geology. Potash is a rock mined from deposits thousands of metres under the ground. Very few places have abundant deposits. The U.S. has very little. Saskatchewan has the largest known reserves globally. And traditionally the U.S. and Canada have had very few trade disruptions, Mr. Linville said. 

“We look at it as a North American market because, typically speaking, we get along quite well ... a place where we truly need to place investment and increased production, it's more on the phosphate side and nitrogen side.” 

Canada's potash legacy

Although potash is found worldwide, Canada was responsible for more than 30 per cent of global production in 2023. It is also home to the largest reserves with 1.1 billion tonnes. Saskatchewan sits atop high-quality potash deposits and has developed the mining infrastructure to exploit them.

Policy volatility in the form of tariffs and trade wars is also unlikely to drive investment, Ms. Nigh said. Expanding or building new fertilizer plants costs billions of dollars and can take years. 

Instead, the White House should follow the course charted over the past few months, she said. On Nov. 14, Mr. Trump issued an executive order to eliminate tariffs on imports of fertilizers. 

These were good moves to bolster investment in fertilizer production, Ms. Nigh said, adding: Tariffs and accusations of price fixing are not. 

“There is an underlying desire for some additional self-sufficiency or buffer,” Ms. Nigh said. “It's about how we get there and we don't want to cause harm to the domestic industry and to our important trade partners and to our growers.” 

The Globe and Mail reached out to Nutrien for comment. The company declined.

Diwali, one of Hinduism's most important festivals, became the 16th Indian tradition added to UNESCO's cultural heritage list. Italian cuisine was also recognized this year.

The UN's educational, scientific and cultural agency, UNESCO announced on Wednesday that Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, has been added to its Intangible Cultural Heritage list.

""People in India and around the world are thrilled,"" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted on X after the announcement.

He called Diwali ""the soul of our civilization,"" adding that the move ""will contribute to the festival's global popularity even further.""


Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of Hinduism's most significant and widely observed festivals.

Millions of faithful, including those from the Sikh and Jain religious communities, celebrate the five-day festival.

Diwali, which occurs on the new moon day in either late October or November, symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.

It is the 16th Indian tradition to be inscribed on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list, joining yoga, the Hindu pilgrimage Kumbh Mela and Durga Puja Festival of Kolkata.

UNESCO members are meeting in New Delhi this week to review dozens of nominations submitted by 78 countries.

The new additions will join the cultural heritage list, created to ""raise awareness of the diversity"" of the traditions passed from one generation to another and ensure their protection for the future.

Here are some new traditions added to the list this year:

Italy's Agriculture and Culture Ministries put forward the world-famous cuisine for the intangible heritage list in 2023.

Pizza, pasta, risotto, gelato and cannoli are enjoyed throughout the world.

""There is no single Italian cuisine, but a mosaic of local expressive diversities,"" the Italian government said.

According to Deloitte, the Italian food service market was worth €251 billion ($293 billion) in 2024, equivalent to 19% of the global restaurant market.

The Mediterranean diet is already on the list, as is the art of Neapolitan ""Pizzaiuolo.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Philanthropist MacKenzie Scott donates $7.1B to nonprofits","https://www.dw.com/en/mackenzie-scott-donates-71-billion-in-2025/a-75083242","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 03:00:05 GMT","

MacKenzie Scott donated $7.1 billion to nonprofits working on climate change and fighting for equality. She is known for charitable gifts to overlooked groups.

The philanthropist MacKenzie Scott revealed Tuesday that she donated $7.1 billion (€6.1 billion) to nonprofits in 2025.

Her donations this year mark a significant increase in annual giving over previous years — which she reported as $2.6 billion in 2024 and $2.1 billion in 2023.

Scott is one of the richest people in the world, and Forbes estimates her net worth at around $33 billion, largely stemming from her stake in Amazon.

She was married to Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos from 1993 to 2019.

Here are the key points:

 

In advance of Scott's public announcement, more than a dozen historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) said they had received a combined $783 million (€673 million) from her this year, according to research by Rutgers University professor Marybeth Gasman.

Some institutions were first-time recipients, while others that had previously received support did not receive funds in this round. Gasman has tracked $1.35 billion (€1.16 billion) in Scott's giving to HBCUs since 2020.

The United Negro College Fund (UNCF) confirmed receiving $70 million (€60 million), which it plans to invest in a collective endowment for participating HBCUs. The Native Forward Scholars Fund, which provides scholarships to Native American students, also received $50 million (€43 million).

Scott's giving model remains notable because her donations come without applications, restrictions, or reporting requirements. She has no public-facing foundation or office, and organizations are typically notified of a gift through intermediaries, according to CBS News.

A 2023 study by the Center for Effective Philanthropy found that recipients generally did not struggle to manage the influx of unrestricted funds and did not see other donors retreat as a result.

California nonprofit 10,000 Degrees said it received a $42 million gift earlier this year. Its CEO, Kim Mazzuca, said she confirmed the amount after being notified by a phone call. The gift is roughly twice the organization's annual budget.

In her essay, Scott contrasted her multibillion-dollar total with the scale of everyday charitable acts. She referenced US data from 2020, citing ""$471 billion"" in charitable donations, along with billions in remittances, crowdfunding, volunteer labor, and service-sector wages.

Scott also described early experiences in which she received help, including free dental care and a loan from a college roommate.

The vote comes just weeks after Brazil's former President Jair Bolsonaro began serving his 27 years long sentence for an attempted coup. It still needs to be approved by the Senate.

Brazil's lower house of Congress voted Wednesday to approve a bill that could significantly reduce former President Jair Bolsonaro's prison sentence.

If the Senate also agrees to the bill, his 27-year sentence could be reduced to just over two years.

The decision comes less than a month after Bolsonaro started serving his 27-year sentence for trying and failing to start an uprising against his successor, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, after losing the 2022 election.

Separately, Bolsonaro's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to authorize his release so he can undergo  ""surgical procedures.""

They said the 70-year-old needs “immediate hospitalization.”

They also urged the court to allow the ex-president to serve his sentence at home for ""humanitarian"" reasons. He is currently being held at a federal prison in Brasilia, the capital.

There was chaos in Brazil's Congress as the lower house discussed the bill that could reduce Bolsonaro's prison sentence.

Lula-allied leftist lawmaker Glauber Braga disrupted Congress and was forcibly removed by police officers after he denounced a ""coup offensive"" and occupied the speaker's chair, according to footage broadcast on local television.

The broadcast was interrupted and the debate was suspended, but the session resumed after order was restored.

Braga said he was exercising his right ""not to accept as a done deal an amnesty for a group of coup plotters.""

The bill would not only greatly lower sentences for several crimes, including trying to overthrow the government, but also let about 100 Bolsonaro supporters out on parole who were jailed for the January 8, 2023, attack on government buildings in Brasilia.

Luigi Mangione wrote “pluck eyebrows” on a to-do list after allegedly assassinating a US healthcare chief executive, prosecutors claim.

Evidence shared with a Manhattan court on Tuesday included a note dated Dec 5, 2024 – the day after Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare was shot dead – with bullet points apparently detailing how the Ivy League graduate planned to change his appearance.

Police arrested Mr Mangione in a McDonald's restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania, following a tip-off from a customer who recognised him by his bushy eyebrows.

Bodycam footage of the moment the 27-year-old was apprehended by 30 officers and asked to remove his face mask was also entered into evidence by prosecutors.

In the clip, Mr Mangione can be seen giving police the name Mark Rosario and a fake New Jersey ID.

Lawyers for Mr Mangione are pushing for a dismissal of the proceedings, contending that the full-length bodycam video shows police interrogating him before he was read his Miranda rights.

They have argued it will create a “substantial probability” that the 27-year-old will not have a fair trial, claiming he was questioned for more than 20 minutes beforehand.

Although Mr Mangione's lawyers have not disputed the authenticity of the evidence seized, they claim it is inadmissible because the arresting officers did not have a warrant to search his backpack.

Police maintain the search was valid because they were looking for a bomb and eventually obtained a warrant.

Officers searched his backpack and found a to-do list and travel plans along with a hand-drawn map of his escape route, according to prosecutors, and alleged tactics for avoiding capture, the court heard.

Recommended

One note presented in court said: “keep momentum, FBI slower overnight,” as well as “check reports for current situation.”

Another listed several tasks, including “change hat, shoes, pluck eyebrows.”

“Buy black shoes (white stripes too distinctive),” read another note with a star drawn next to it.

A sandwich, a loaded gun magazine wrapped in a pair of wet underwear, a 9mm handgun, a silencer and a bag of sliced bread were also found by police in his backpack, the court heard.

Mr Mangione has pleaded not guilty to state charges of second-degree murder, as well as in a separate federal trial where prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.

Eight in ten Americans view the wealth gap as a problem that is either “very big” or “somewhat big.”

As we produce journalism that combats authoritarianism, censorship, injustice, and misinformation, your support is urgently needed. Please make a year-end gift to Truthout today.

A new Economist/YouGov poll published this week indicates that a majority of Americans are supportive of higher taxes on the rich, and believe that the federal government has an obligation to address wealth inequality.

Asked whether they think billionaires in the U.S. are taxed either too much or too little, 61 percent said billionaires' tax rates were either “somewhat too low” or “much too low.” Eighteen percent said they were happy with how billionaires are currently being taxed, while 14 percent expressed uncertainty. Just 6 percent said that billionaires were taxed “somewhat too high” or “much too high.”

Even among 2024 Trump voters, a plurality (34 percent) felt that taxes on billionaires were too low, while just 12 percent said that taxes on billionaires were too high. 

A majority of the poll's respondents, 80 percent, said they believe the rich have too much political power in the U.S. Only 8 percent said the rich do not have too much political power.

Only 6 percent said that the wealth gap wasn't a problem at all. Eight in ten Americans expressed the opposing view, with a majority of Americans, 52 percent, saying that the gap is a “very big” problem and another 28 percent saying it was a “somewhat big” problem. Fourteen percent called it a “minor” issue. 

Fifty-seven percent of voters said lawmakers in Washington, D.C. should pursue policies to reduce the wealth gap, while only 22 percent of voters said the federal government shouldn't try to tackle the issue.

There are several reasons for the U.S.'s widening wealth gap. While the minimum wage has risen a few times since the 1970s, employee compensation, as a percentage of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), has actually declined for most workers, down by 14 percent since that time. Meanwhile, corporate profits have increased by 193 percent since 1970, providing shareholders — who are generally wealthy to begin with — with an increase in dividends of 274 percent as a share of GDP. 

Put another way, if working class Americans had kept all of the economic gains they had made from 1947 through 1970, and kept pace with those gains to the present day, they would have earned $1.7 trillion more in combined income in the year 2023 alone.

Racism also plays a role in wealth inequality, as systemic hurdles continue to make it difficult for nonwhite families to accumulate generational wealth. In 1980, the average wealth of a Black family was around $83,000, and for a Latinx family, it was about $78,000; a white family at that time had over $404,000 in wealth, on average. 

All three groups have seen increases since that time, but white families much more so — the average family wealth for Black and Latinx families in 2022, for example, was around $211,000 and $227,000, respectively, while for white families, it was over $1.3 million, on average.

Despite actions by the Trump administration that could actually widen the wealth gap in the near future, the Economist/YouGov polling results from this week showcase an American voting public that is supportive of efforts to reduce wealth inequality, consistent with numbers from other polling sources. Indeed, recent polls on health care also demonstrate that voters are supportive of prioritizing ambitious government spending goals, with high support for the Affordable Care Act (57 percent approval for the program in a recent Gallup poll) and even higher backing for a Medicare for All approach (63 percent in a Data for Progress poll). 

Providing more public funding for health care would likely correct some (though by no means all) of the problems associated with wealth inequality. Indeed, a study from the University of Washington School of Medicine in 2018 found that the way the U.S. funds health care today “exacerbates income inequality and impoverishes millions of Americans,” creating a “regressive financing pattern” that is only “improved minimally” by the ACA.

In a span of less than 12 weeks, ICE filed to block a judge's order granting release 877 times across the country.

As we produce journalism that combats authoritarianism, censorship, injustice, and misinformation, your support is urgently needed. Please make a year-end gift to Truthout today.

This article was originally published by Documented, an independent, non-profit newsroom dedicated to reporting with and for immigrant communities in New York City. The original article can be accessed here.

When Juan was granted bond on August 6, it looked as if he would soon be freed from a Brooklyn immigration jail to return to his 6-year-old daughter, 10-month-old son, his partner, and his job at a grocery store.

Since he has no criminal record and support from his church, employer and family, the Colombian native was required to post only the minimum bond: $1,500. Immigration Judge Charles Conroy noted in his decision at New York's Varick Street court that the government had submitted no evidence whatsoever that Juan posed any danger. But just a few hours later, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) blocked his freedom by invoking a special regulation that was created a month after the 9/11 attacks “to prevent the release of aliens who may pose a threat to national security.”

ICE had rarely resorted to this “automatic stay” of a judge's bond decision in the past — just three times in the five years from 2020 to 2024. But, according to data released to Documented in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, that changed drastically this summer. In less than 12 weeks, from July 1 to Sept. 16, ICE filed to block a judge's order granting release 877 times across the country, records from the Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) show.

This means ICE and the Department of Homeland Security now claim to have unilateral power to delay a detainee's release pending appeal. It's not necessary to get approval from the judge who granted bond or from the Board of Immigration Appeals. ICE only has to file a form with the court, called an EOIR-43, with a short note from a senior attorney that says there is valid reason for it.

In response to the Trump administration's aggressive use of the regulation (8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(i)(2)), there's been at least 50 federal district court rulings in the last six months holding that ICE had violated detainees' constitutional rights to due process in individual cases. 

“This ‘heads I win, tails you lose' process deprives Petitioner of his due process rights and has no place in the law,” a federal judge in Manhattan wrote in a Nov. 25 decision ordering the release of another detainee, a Salvadoran man who'd been jailed since February. 

Raha Jorjani, an immigration attorney with the Alameda County Public Defender's Office, published an academic study of the automatic-stay regulation in 2010. She said it wasn't surprising that federal judges have so often rejected use of the rule. “Immigration attorneys and advocates have long warned about the dangers of such regulations remaining in effect, and the current administration's prolific abuse of the regulations validates those concerns,” she said via email.

Federal authorities maintain that enough safeguards are built into the system to protect detainees' right to due process. 

Juan (Documented is withholding his name due to his pending asylum request) was one of the 478 immigration detainees blocked from release during the month of August after ICE attorneys used their automatic-stay-in-jail card. He'd already been jailed for 59 days, starting on June 9 with sleepless nights in the overcrowded lockup at 26 Federal Plaza, where ICE detained him when he reported for a check-in. 

ICE began using the “automatic stay” work around routinely at the same time the agency issued a July 8 memo that radically re-interpreted federal law to expose millions more non-citizens to mandatory detention — no opportunity for a bond hearing — if they entered the country without a visa. In technical terms, ICE has re-defined who is an “applicant for admission.” Federal courts have ruled in 282 cases that this July 8 revision violated the constitutional rights of individual detainees, with the government winning in only six cases, according to the most comprehensive list of rulings available, compiled in mid-November by a federal judge in Philadelphia. 

In the cases where detainees were getting favorable bond rulings from immigration judges, ICE filed for hundreds of automatic stays to stop the bond rulings from taking effect during an appeal.

These entwined policies have contributed to a massive increase in the number of immigration detainees who give up the right to contest their deportation charges and instead request voluntary departure from the country, as previously reported.

As many others have done, Juan's attorneys filed a habeas petition in federal court that challenged both prongs of the government's offensive on constitutional grounds. He was ordered released from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn on Oct. 21, the same day his suit was filed. A more detailed decision on Nov. 18 found, as nearly all other judges did previously, that the government was wrong in its claim that Juan was not entitled to a bond hearing. The judge wrote that it wasn't necessary to determine if the “automatic stay” was unconstitutional, but many other judges have.

Manhattan federal judge Vernon Broderick wrote in a Nov. 25 decision that federal district courts have ruled more than 50 times since June 2025 that ICE had violated the constitutional right to due process through its use of the automatic-stay regulation. The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan was able to point to just two rulings favorable to the government. (One of those cases was for a detainee whom the federal appeals court in Boston has since ordered released.) 

The ruling was a victory for a Salvadoran man from Queens who was identified in court only as M.P.L. He had been held by ICE at Orange County Correctional Facility in Goshen for nearly nine months by the time Broderick ordered his release. He had no criminal record in the 18 years he'd been living in the United States, but the government contended he'd had ties to the MS-13 gang while living in El Salvador. The immigration judge found that ICE had offered conflicting evidence concerning the gang connection, and ruled that M.P.L.'s 18 years in the United States showed he wasn't a danger; bond was set at $1,500. The federal court order restored that decision.

As cases like M.P.L.'s mount up, judges are expressing frustration. “The government requests that I ignore precedent from the Supreme Court, a case from within this District, and over 50 district court decisions in the last 6 months across the country,” Broderick wrote. “I decline that invitation.”

Nicholas Biase, a spokesperson for Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, declined to comment on the case or on his office's continued defense of the new ICE detention policies.

ICE and the Department of Homeland Security didn't respond to requests for comment.

ICE lawyers have rushed to invoke the automatic stay, as Manhattan federal judge Dale Ho described in two rulings that were in favor of a 23-year-old Salvadoran man.  

J.M.P., as he is named in federal court records, had been assaulted by MS-13 gangsters who extorted money from him and his family's bakery in El Salvador, Ho wrote. At the age of 14, he was convicted of an attempted homicide (with no one injured), and served 14 months in a juvenile facility, according to court records. After that, he eventually fled to the United States in 2020 at the age of 18 to avoid further attacks.

On Jan. 29, ICE held J.M.P. at the Orange County Jail, contending he was subject to mandatory detention because of alleged ties to the MS-13 gang. An immigration judge denied him a bond hearing, but J.M.P.'s attorney filed a habeas petition in federal court, leading to Judge Ho's Sept. 10 order that he be given a bond hearing. 

 With the government's insistence on “mandator detention” cleared away, the immigration judge released J.M.P. on a $15,000 bond, finding that he'd been a victim of gang extortion in El Salvador, not a member of MS-13. 

That oral ruling at 1:39 p.m. on Sept. 19 set off a bureaucratic race, court records show. At 1:57 p.m., a fund that assists immigration detainees with bond money filed a request with ICE to accept the necessary payment. At 2:59 p.m., ICE filed the EOIR-43 form again, this time saying that it intended to appeal the bond decision. This blocked J.M.P.'s release once more.

J.M.P.'s lawyers went back to federal court, where Judge Ho ruled that his rights were again being violated, and that ICE must release J.M.P. once he posted bond. 

“The government appears to be suggesting that, to obtain his freedom, J.M.P. could simply accept deportation to El Salvador — the country where he has said he fears harm and persecution if he returns,” the judge wrote. “That is no alternative.”

The Chinese Communist Party is threatening Canadian democracy by influencing politicians, business leaders, and community influencers, and suppressing those who speak out against China, says a former national director of the RCMP's proceeds-of-crime program.

Clement told the audience that the CCP directs diaspora communities, cultural groups, and business chambers abroad, while monitoring, suppressing, and intimidating dissidents who speak out against China. This is going on in Canada “on a daily basis,” he noted.

The CCP's United Front Work Department works to shape narratives in Canadian society and overseas Chinese communities by co-opting elites, business leaders, community influencers, language schools, and media outlets, Clement said.

When it comes to influencing Canada's politicians and elites, Clement said that the fact that several high-ranking Canadian politicians have worked at the Canada China Business Council—which he said is involved in suppressing Chinese dissidents in Canada—at the end of their careers indicates they have been influenced by elite capture.

Clement also said there are Chinese criminal groups operating in Canada that are involved in fentanyl trafficking and money laundering. These groups “operate in parallel” with the CCP's United Front to engage in diaspora influence and elite capture, he said.

The CCP is also impacting Canadian society through its role in the “fentanyl wars against North America,” Clement said, noting that the regime could shut down the flow of fentanyl precursors into Canada “if they really wanted to.”

“In my view, by allowing the precursors to flow in, they're creating disruptive warfare, just like what happened during the Opium Wars,” he said. “That's the price we're paying for it.”

Dean Baxendale, CEO of the China Democracy Fund and Optimum Publishing International, also spoke at the forum, calling China's influence on Canada “warfare without combat.”

The CCP is involved in a number of statecraft operations in Canada, including hybrid warfare, cyber espionage, illicit trade, organized crime, and transnational repression, Baxendale said.

He said the CCP engages in information and media warfare in Canada by retelling history, controlling the narrative about China, and manipulating public opinion, including through the use of advertising.

“This messaging helps to control, direct, and set a set of values which they're aspiring to,” Baxendale said, adding that these are tactics the CCP uses to “slow down negative perspectives” that expose its operations. “These are all things that manipulate the psyche, the mind,” he said.

China also engages in financial warfare in Canada by targeting the economy through “debt traps” and using tariffs as an economic coercion strategy, Baxendale said. He added that China has significant influence operations targeting Canada's major ports to facilitate illicit trade practices.

Canadian intelligence agencies have identified the CCP as “the most sophisticated, clandestine, and persistent among all state actors,” said Maria Cheung, professor emeritus and researcher at the University of Manitoba, who also spoke the forum.

Cheung said the CCP uses a combination of public opinion warfare, legal warfare, and psychological warfare “to silence dissidents and control narratives beyond its borders in a very sophisticated and clandestine manner,” shaping the world's “security landscape.”

She also noted that the CCP uses transnational repression against groups like Shen Yun Performing Arts, a New York-based classical Chinese dance and music company that aims to revive China's pre-communist heritage and expose the ongoing human rights abuses in China.

Public opinion warfare involves using both traditional and social media to shape perceptions and control narratives, and in the context of transnational repression, exploit “cognitive biases in the West to amplify divisive content and discredit target groups,” Cheung said.

Legal warfare involves creating financial strain and damaging reputations by merely levelling accusations, not necessarily winning legal cases, Cheung explained. Meanwhile, she said, the CCP also weaponizes Western media through disinformation, which “demoralizes, sows fear, erodes trust, [and] disrupts decision-making.”

Cheung said China's tactics aim to “undermine democratic sovereignty, rule of law, and civil liberties—values that we uphold” in Canada.

International human rights lawyer David Matas told the forum audience he has encountered a number of different situations involving transnational repression in his work as a human rights lawyer.

He noted a case in Canada where a Falun Gong practitioner was evicted from an Ottawa Chinese Seniors Association due to her faith. After the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal told the association to invite her back, the association dissolved instead of complying with the order, Matas said.

Matas also mentioned a case in 2004 where officials from the Chinese Consulate in Calgary were distributing anti-Falun Gong hate literature at a University of Alberta conference. He said the police had recommended the consular officials be prosecuted for wilful promotion of hatred—an offence in the Criminal Code. However, the attorney general would not provide the consent required to carry out the prosecution and the court would not override the attorney general's decision.

He said he has also witnessed Beijing's suppression of media overseas, including certain U.S. media outlets shutting down any reporting on forced organ harvesting in China involving Falun Gong practitioners, Uyghurs, Tibetans, and Christians.

Matas said he has experienced Beijing's transnational repression himself when visiting other countries such as Australia and Israel, including having events cancelled where he was expected to speak about China.

Cheung raised concern about the “normalization” of the CCP using its tactics in Canada, and said Canadians need to engage in resistance by speaking out, forming alliances, telling their MPs about the issue, and signing petitions “so that politicians can act according to our conscience to protect our society.”

Clement said Canadians need to stand up and “try to force the issue a little bit” so that legislative changes can happen, noting there are gaps in legislation and law enforcement in Canada that need to be addressed to successfully combat the issue. He also said that Canadian society needs to improve its digital literacy, protect diaspora communities from coercion, and support transparent and secure democratic processes.

Matas said those who engage in transnational repression can be prosecuted in Canada, as it is harassment and intimidation. If those who engage in transnational repression are not Canadians, they can be deported and banned entry into Canada, he added.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

 Trump Can Defy the Skeptics and Seal the Deal

 Thomas Graham

Deep skepticism has surrounded U.S. President Donald Trump's latest attempt to settle the Russia-Ukraine war. Ukraine, backed by Europe, has been clear that it is not prepared to accept terms that amount to surrender, while Russia has given no signal that it will back off its maximalist demands, which would end Ukraine's existence as a sovereign, independent state. That, skeptics argue, leaves no ground for serious negotiations. Russian President Vladimir Putin's evident refusal to make any substantive concessions at his talks with Trump's envoys on December 2 only reinforces their doubts.

But the skeptics are wrong. The time is ripe for a resolution of the conflict in the coming months. The real question is whether the Trump administration can muster the skill, patience, and stamina to drive a diplomatic process to a successful conclusion.

Nearly four years of brutal combat, in which neither side has achieved a strategic breakthrough, has created a paradoxical situation in which both countries lose the longer the war rages on. The best deal each side can achieve is available now, not in six months or later. Ukraine will not gain anything by waiting to negotiate from a hypothetical future position of strength; such a position will not come soon, if ever. Ukrainian leaders have already acknowledged that they cannot liberate by force all the territory Russia has seized. What Ukraine cannot achieve on the battlefield will not be handed to it at the negotiating table. Nor will a stronger Ukraine incline Western countries to provide it with more formidable security guarantees. Western governments have already made it clear that they will not risk war with Russia to defend Ukraine. And the longer Ukraine waits, the more destruction it will have to endure.

Instead of seeking a position of strength, Ukraine urgently needs to settle the conflict, which has devastated the country economically and demographically. The cost of reconstruction over the next decade has been estimated at more than 2.6 times its pre-war GDP of $200 billion. Kyiv will find it increasingly difficult to man the frontlines and has yet to demonstrate that it can halt Russia's grinding advance. Close to seven million Ukrainians—about one-sixth of the pre-war population—have fled the country; many will never return. In response to the national emergency, the concentration of power in the president's office and the indefinite postponement of elections nationwide are slowly eroding the foundations of the country's fragile democracy. An unfolding corruption scandal, which has engulfed senior officials, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's powerful chief of staff, graphically illustrates the corrosive impact of the concentration of power. Each day the war continues, Ukraine's future looks bleaker.

Russia appears stronger. But it has paid a staggering price—more than one million dead or wounded—for marginal tactical gains. During this year's offensive, Russia seized just one percent of Ukrainian territory at the cost of more than 200,000 dead and wounded. The cost of recruiting new volunteers is soaring, while the Kremlin still fears the social repercussions of a mass mobilization. After two years of growth of over four percent, the economy has stalled. The forecast for this year and next hovers around one percent growth. Meanwhile, Russia has invested negligible sums in cutting-edge technologies. In short, it is mortgaging its future to sustain the conflict. As a result, each day the war continues, Russia falls further behind the great powers—China and the United States, to be sure, and also possibly India and Europe, with which it hopes to compete in the decades ahead.

Unsurprisingly, Russia and Ukraine remain far apart on the terms of a settlement, particularly on territorial questions and the nature of security guarantees for both of them. Ukraine will not cede territory in the Donbas that Russia has not conquered, as the Kremlin demands. Nor will it, simply to make Russia feel secure, easily abandon its ambition of joining NATO—the ultimate security guarantee—or cap its military capabilities at levels inadequate to deter future Russian aggression.

But these gaps are bridgeable. Indeed, the contours of a final settlement are visible, even if both sides vigorously deny it: a cease-fire along the line of contact without either country formally recognizing the other's control of territory it considers its own; armed neutrality, or sufficient military capabilities to reliably defend one's territory, for Ukraine with the possibility of EU accession but not membership in NATO; and no further NATO expansion eastward into the former Soviet space. Such an outcome would enable Putin to declare victory and Zelensky to claim he had preserved what was most precious—Ukraine's sovereignty and independence as well as its European aspirations. It would also spare both countries the further depredations of continued warfare. But agreement on these terms can only be achieved in strictly confidential negotiations, in which the two belligerents can make the necessary compromises on sensitive issues as part of a broader peace agreement.

Achieving this outcome will, however, require a concerted diplomatic effort that engages all parties to the conflict: Russia, Ukraine, and the United States, as well as Europe. But only one country can lead that effort: the United States. It enjoys unique leverage over the other three parties. As it has already demonstrated, Washington can pressure Ukraine and Europe by threatening to cut essential assistance, including irreplaceable battlefield intelligence. It can also pressure Russia effectively, although not solely through sanctions or arms for Ukraine, which figure most prominently in public discussions. Those tools matter—especially the arms needed to stop Russia's advance on the battlefield and to minimize the consequences of its aerial assault—but they alone will not deliver a settlement.

The United States also needs to deploy the formidable psychological leverage it possesses over Russia. One cannot overstate the role the United States—and Trump personally—plays in validating Russia as a great power and Putin as a global leader. This matters all the more because Russia has struggled on the battlefield against what it (and most Western observers) assumed was a second- or third-tier military. Instead of the anticipated blitzkrieg and swift conquest of Ukraine, the Kremlin will soon find itself fighting the Ukrainians for longer than it took the Soviet Union to crush Nazi Germany in World War II. Washington can exercise that leverage in the first instance by assuring Moscow that it would be willing to normalize relations. Such a measure will help convince Putin that the United States will not relegate Russia to a secondary tier of interest once the war is resolved. Trump's new National Security Strategy makes clear that the administration no longer considers Russia a major threat, to the consternation of traditional U.S. allies. Normalization is also strategically important to Putin in its own right: it would allow him to rebalance Russia's relationship with China and expand his room to maneuver globally.

Washington has already promised normalization once the war is on a clear path toward resolution. But words alone will not satisfy Putin. He seeks concrete evidence of Washington's intentions. That could include establishing working groups on key bilateral issues—nuclear policy, the Arctic, and commercial relations, for example—and holding initial meetings to set the agenda and lay out the first steps. That would give Putin confidence that the United States will continue to treat Russia as a serious player, commensurate with Moscow's own self-perception. The White House should make it clear that tangible progress on any of these bilateral issues depends on the Kremlin taking the hard decisions needed to end the war.

The Kremlin's desire for normal diplomatic relations also applies to the narrower question of the Russia-Ukraine war. Earlier this year, it initially embraced the idea of a quick resolution reached through direct talks with Trump, using Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff as a confidential conduit. In the Kremlin's scheme, the two presidents would agree on the deal, and Trump would impose it on the Ukrainians. But that approach ran aground by late spring. The Ukrainians resisted U.S. pressure, and the Europeans stepped in to support Ukraine in resisting both Moscow's aggression and Washington's bullying.

With the diplomatic situation more complex and the talks narrowing to a few crucial issues, Russian leaders want to establish a more traditional negotiating process. They understand that presidential phone calls and long talks with Witkoff cannot do that, and presidential meetings produce lasting results only if lower-level officials work out the details in advance. That would entail creating expert working groups, which the Trump administration has hesitated to do. The Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov hinted at this approach after Putin's December 2 meeting with Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and occasional envoy. U.S.-Russian talks, Ushakov said, would continue between the presidents, presidential assistants, and other officials.

That is a template that Washington should embrace. The Kremlin, to be sure, was speaking only of bilateral contacts. But the Trump administration should expand this approach to include Ukrainians and Europeans. The Russians will almost certainly resist participating directly with Europeans in any working groups, and they will be reluctant to engage Ukrainians in a trilateral format with Americans also in the room. That means that at least initially, the United States will have to shuttle between parallel working groups with the Ukrainians and Europeans, on the one hand, and the Russians, on the other, until there is sufficient trust to bring all the parties together in unified working groups.



This broadened process would require a number of working groups that at a minimum would study territorial disputes, security guarantees, and cease-fire modalities. The composition of the groups would vary by topic: a U.S.-Russian working group could suffice for nuclear issues; Russians, Ukrainians, and Americans could address territorial issues; and Europeans would have to participate in discussions of security guarantees and broader matters of European security. The working groups would initially be tasked with reaching consensus on the elements of a settlement and developing sufficient detail on implementation so that the parties can sign a framework agreement and put a cease-fire in place. Subsequently, they would flesh out the framework agreement to produce a final settlement on all the issues in their purview.

Even if working groups are established, the White House–Kremlin channel will be indispensable. It is the only channel that can set the broad principles and parameters to guide the efforts of the working groups and break the logjams that will inevitably arise.

Critics will argue that such a diplomatic effort is beyond the capabilities of the Trump administration. It allegedly lacks the discipline, consistency, capacity, and patience to pursue a sustained diplomatic effort. But even the admittedly halting progress in current negotiations would not have been possible had Trump not opened a dialogue with Putin in February with the goal of ending the war. Despite much speculation to the contrary, Trump has neither abandoned Ukraine to Russia's will nor walked away from the problem as one that is too hard to solve. And the U.S. national security apparatus has the expertise and skill needed to manage a complex diplomatic undertaking, if only the administration could find a way to reliably control its own bureaucracy, which it does not trust.

Success is not assured, of course, and it will not come as quickly as Trump desires. But with one last effort, he could once again defy his critics and end a conflict others thought intractable.

 The Abiding Power of Sectarianism in the Middle East

 Maria Fantappie and Vali Nasr

It has become conventional wisdom that the strikes launched on Iran this year by Israel and the United States, and the shattering of Tehran's allies and proxy militias in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria, have decisively curbed Iran's influence in the Middle East. But this view misunderstands the nature of Iran's so-called “axis of resistance”—and Tehran's potential ability to reconstitute it.

After the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, Iran capitalized on the turmoil to build a transnational ideological network of Shiite communities, governments, and militias from Iran to Iraq to Lebanon, Yemen, and the Palestinian territories, or what King Abdullah of Jordan fretfully referred to as a “Shiite crescent.” By 2014, analysts regularly observed that Tehran controlled four Arab capitals: Baghdad, Beirut, Damascus, and Sanaa.

From a military standpoint, this axis now lies in tatters. Its Iranian architects are aging, and their partners in the Arab world have been decimated by Israeli strikes. A cautious rapprochement over the last two years between Iran and Saudi Arabia, whose rivalry had formerly driven the region's sectarian conflict, has also contributed to the perception that the sectarian battle in the Middle East is over.

But even if the curtain is falling on the axis of resistance, the Shiite political and religious identity remains intact. Although Iran's proxy network helped Tehran maintain outsize influence over the Arab world, the axis's resilience also drew on the enduring power of faith, community, and family ties. What comes next for the region's Shiites is a question that looms large over the efforts mustered by Gulf Arab countries and the United States to bring stability to the Middle East after the devastating war between Israel and Hamas. These would-be peacemakers must therefore pay much more careful attention to factoring the region's Shiites, both within and outside Iran, into their vision for regional order.

The current plan to disarm Hezbollah without ending Israel's occupation of the country's south—much less providing for the reconstruction of devastated Lebanese Shiite areas, replacing the kinds of services Shiites once received from Hezbollah, or giving Shiites greater say in national politics—effectively disenfranchises Shiites. If Israel follows through on its recent threats to invade Lebanon, that would pose an existential threat to the country's Shiite community and mobilize it into resistance. And as Sunni rule coalesces in Syria and the U.S. military puts pressure on Shiite militias in Iraq, a sense of a siege on Shiites could assume a regional dimension. If Shiites are marginalized in state-building efforts and diplomacy, they are likely to re-embrace communal politics as a strategy of survival, stoking broader instability. And without a stake in the new order, Iran cannot be successfully contained.

Although Shiites represent only 15 to 20 percent of Muslims worldwide, they constitute roughly half the Muslim population of the Middle East. Shiite Muslims form the majority of the population in Bahrain, Iran, and Iraq and nearly the majority in Yemen; they are the largest religious community in Lebanon. Throughout the twentieth century, however, the face of the region was Sunni. Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution raised the specter of Shiite ascendancy—and with it, Sunni resistance. Sectarian tensions undergirded the grueling 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War, which forged key Shiite transnational ties: Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who would later become the leader of Iraq's Shiite militias, fled Iraq during that war and fought alongside his Iranian peers against Saddam Hussein.

These transnational Shiite ties expanded dramatically after U.S. forces toppled the Iraqi government in 2003, triggering a revival of religious identity as more Shiites found their way to holy shrines in Iran, Iraq, and Syria as well as to historic Shiite centers of learning in Najaf, south of Baghdad, and Qom, south of Tehran. Shiite political and military forces also emerged to fill power vacuums in Iraq. In the mid-2000s, Iran's Revolutionary Guards enlisted the help of Iraqi allies such as Muhandis and Lebanese Hezbollah fighters such as Ali Musa Daqduq and Imad Mughniyeh to organize Iraqi Shiite militants who refused to disarm and join the U.S.-led political transition.

When the Arab Spring broke out in 2011, Iranian and Shiite influence in the Arab world expanded further as civil wars engulfed Syria and Yemen. Those power struggles were inevitably sectarian: Syria's Alawite rulers only loosely identified with Shiism, yet the threat that Sunni Islamism posed to them turned them into close allies of both Iran and Hezbollah. In 2013, Iran and Hezbollah organized Afghan, Iraqi, and Pakistani Shiite fighters to help Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's army challenge Sunni Islamists, who were backed by regional Sunni rivals of Iran. The following year, Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Corps joined Iraqi Shiite militias in launching a full-scale war against the Sunni-led Islamic State (also known as ISIS). The commander of the Revolutionary Guard Corps, Qasem Soleimani, led the campaign and became a ubiquitous presence on Iraqi and Syrian battlefields. The Houthis in Yemen, meanwhile—who follow the Zaydi offshoot of Shiism—made common cause with Iran in challenging Yemen's Sunnis.

Senior Shiite religious authorities, mainstream middle-class Shiites in places such as Baghdad and Beirut, and Shiite elites who feared ISIS's sectarian bloodlust all supported the war against ISIS, turning it into a broadly Shiite struggle. In June 2014—with ISIS at Baghdad's doorsteps—Iraq's most senior Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who had always opposed Iranian efforts to muster Shiites across the region into military campaigns, even issued a religious edict directing Iraqi youth to join Soleimani's militias.

Battlefield victories over ISIS helped sustain Shiite rule in Iraq, the Houthis' fight in Yemen, and the Baathist regime in Syria. They also helped link the fight waged against Israel by the Sunni militias Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad to the axis of resistance's general struggle. Buoyed by these successes, Iran used the axis to project power throughout the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, forging a so-called ring of fire around Israel.

But the decisive defeat of ISIS in 2019 created the conditions for the axis's decline. The mobilization of young Shiite Muslims into anti-ISIS militias plummeted. Leading Shiite clerics in the region became more reluctant to conflate religious observance with participation in Iran's military efforts. From his vantage point in the Iraqi city of Najaf, Sistani openly distanced himself from the axis's campaigns and condemned militia violence, arguing that Shiites' enduring power in Iraq rested in their ability to build influence over the state and politics. 

Shiite militias had seized control of a vast amount of Iraqi territory during the anti-ISIS campaign, exceeding the reach of the Iraqi military and police in numerous cities and in certain parts of Baghdad and gaining considerable economic power independent of the central government. But their credibility as saviors of the Shiites and guarantors of stability in Iraq suffered as they engaged in thuggery and cracked down on anticorruption protests. In 2020, a U.S. airstrike killed both Soleimani and Muhandis, marking another loss for the axis. In 2021, Iraqi political parties affiliated with Iran and with Iranian-backed militias won only 17 seats in the parliament, down from 48 in 2018.

The Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, initially appeared to be a formidable show of force by the axis. But in reality, it exposed and accelerated the axis's decline. Shiite forces across the region attempted to mobilize in support of Hamas. But in November 2024, Israel decimated Hezbollah by converting the group's own communications equipment into bombs, killing 42 and maiming thousands of the group's officials and fighters, and assassinated scores of its commanders and its charismatic leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an airstrike. A month after that, in Syria, the Assad regime collapsed before an advancing army of Turkish-backed Sunni fighters.

When Israel and the United States unleashed their bruising direct military attack on Iran in June, Tehran's Shiite proxies did not rise to help defend it. Forced to turn their attention inward, Iran's leaders did not see a benefit in making transnational appeals and instead called on the Iranian public to defend their homeland. Similarly, Shiite allies in Iraq and Lebanon turned away from rhetoric that rested on a transnational religious identity and more fully embraced their own nationalisms.



Rather than directing their regional allies, Iran now appears to be following those allies' lead. What was once a hub-and-spoke system of influence has come to look more like a federation of like-minded groups that share objectives but operate autonomously. In Iraq, Iran is encouraging its proxies to trade in their khakis for suits and join the political process. In Lebanon, Hezbollah may accept disarmament under pressure from Israel and the United States to avoid war with Israel and civil war with other Lebanese factions. And changes inside Iran itself—the growing prominence of nationalism and the relaxation of religious strictures, most notably the looser enforcement of hijab—is eroding the country's claim to transnational spiritual leadership.

The leaders who oversaw the rise of the Shiites are also exiting the stage. Commanders and clerics who participated in the 1979 Iranian Revolution (and have managed to evade assassination) are aging. Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, is 86. Sistani, who presided over a regional revival of Shiite piety centered in Iraq's holy cities, is 95 and ailing. Najaf and Qom have long been rival seats of Shiite learning, but during the decades in which Iran focused on building military and political muscle, Najaf more than Qom (or Tehran) came to represent Shiite religious authority. Sistani's successor in Iraq, not Khamenei's successor in Iran, will direct Shiites in matters of faith.

Israel wants to break up Iran's regional network by actively fomenting further fracturing among Shiites. If weak yet pliant governments that harass or threaten their own minority populations—particularly Shiites—take hold in Lebanon and Syria, the thinking goes, Shiite energy will focus on internal battles for turf and influence rather than on combating Israel. In its occupation of southern Lebanon, meanwhile, Israel is routinely attacking Shiite targets, killing scores of civilians as well as Hezbollah fighters. And its efforts to prevent Damascus from asserting control over Syria are setting the country's minorities on a collision course with their central government.

Yet the decline of Shiite military power throughout the Middle East does not mean that Shiites' religious identity and sense of being part of a transnational faith community have weakened. The number of Shiites making pilgrimages to Iraq's holy cities is steadily growing year on year despite political and military losses. In August, the commemoration of the martyrdom of the third Shiite imam drew an estimated 21 million worshipers to the Iraqi city of Karbala.

As Iran falters and pressure builds on Shiite militias to disarm, Shiites fear a future of marginalization and violence. Syria, which had been the linchpin of the axis, is now ruled by veterans of ISIS and other militant Sunni groups that fought against Hezbollah during Syria's civil war. The new regime in Damascus is backed by the region's principal Sunni powers, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, and looking to forge a deal with Israel. Meanwhile, Shiites in Lebanon and Iraq worry that Damascus could support Sunnis in their countries, changing the balance of power to their disadvantage.

Threatened and feeling besieged, Shiites may turn even more decisively toward a communal identity. Syria's Druze and Alawite minorities have already begun to resist Damascus's authority. To prevent new civil wars, government collapse, and a resurgence of extremism—in short, the very circumstances that allowed Iran to build the axis of resistance in the first place—state-building efforts in Lebanon and Syria should focus on guaranteeing equal rights for all communities. If Beirut and Damascus exclude minorities, marginalized Shiites will again turn to Iran for support; once conflict erupts, Iranian help with training, arms, and financing will follow.

In Iraq, where the delicate process of forming a government and intra-Shiite negotiation continues, moderate Shiite leadership must be encouraged. This requires constitutional reforms to dismantle the clientelist networks of militants turned politicians (a system that still grants them seats in parliaments and provincial councils). Recent U.S. policy has put heavy pressure on Iraq's government to distance itself from Iran. Washington must avoid forcing Baghdad to make such a stark choice: doing so could undermine the standing of moderate Shiite leaders and undo their attempts to blunt the disruptive influence of militants turned politicians and insulate Iraq from the conflict between Iran and Israel.



Across the region, avoiding a return to violence depends on ensuring that Shiites see a political future in their respective countries—a national role that would replace adherence to a transnational ideology—as well as economic opportunities outside the largess of militias. In Lebanon, for instance, simply disarming and dismantling Hezbollah will not bring stability. For decades, the organization acted as a state for the Shiite community, providing security, jobs, and social services; now that the group's role is diminished, Shiites must be offered other means of participating in the country's politics and economy

The Lebanese, Syrian, and Iraqi governments—with the help of the United States and Arab neighbors—must provide Shiites with middle-class jobs in the private sector to reduce their dependence on employment in the public sector, which militants control. There are Shiite middle classes in Lebanon and Iraq that are poised to take advantage of the economic opportunities that United States and its Gulf allies envision for the region after Israel's military operations end. Without a means of economic participation, young people could be drawn back into militancy.

As Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states make investments to encourage the rise of strong, centralized governments in Lebanon and Syria that can resist Iranian influence, they must not let those efforts interfere with the process of normalization with Iran. Normalization has helped keep the Gulf stable as the rest of the Middle East erupted into war, and to ensure that this stability persists, Arab states must more actively pair state-building plans with an economic vision that also offers a future to Shiite areas in Lebanon and Iraq. Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates must ensure that their current cease-fires with the Houthis hold and that diplomatic progress continues toward ending Yemen's civil war for good. To prevent Iran's resurgence as a regional spoiler, they must drop the mindset that Shiites throughout the region are vassals of Iran and treat them as equal citizens.

If the United States, for its part, wants to end conflict in the Middle East and see Iraq prosper independent of Iranian control, it also has to integrate Shiite groups into the national and regional orders it envisions. In Lebanon, that means coupling the effort to disarm Hezbollah with a clear plan for reconstructing Shiite areas and enfranchising Shiites politically. The United States must do all it can to safeguard the cease-fire between Hezbollah and Israel, too: Lebanese Shiites will certainly resist an Israeli invasion and occupation, just as they did between 1982 and 2000. Renewed resistance would breathe new life into what remains of the axis.

Washington must buttress the efforts by Arab states to normalize ties with Iran, which means talking to Tehran directly. Contrary to what U.S. President Donald Trump seems to assume, Iran does not feel defeated after the 12-day war in June. Tehran believes that the missiles it launched at Israel inflicted enough damage to give both Israel and the United States pause before contemplating another round of fighting. And by now, it is also clear that the strikes did not fully obliterate Iran's nuclear capabilities and ambitions.

Regional stability depends on Iran's engaging diplomatically and economically with the Arab world, but Arab states are wary of granting a larger regional role to a Tehran that may go nuclear. Any restoration of diplomatic relations with Bahrain or expansion of economic ties with other Gulf states is contingent on Iran's progress in nuclear talks. Sooner rather than later, Washington will therefore have to refocus its attention on negotiating a nuclear deal with Tehran.

Keeping the Levant fractured will not bring stability to the Middle East. The Shiite communities that once undergirded the axis of resistance must be incorporated into the region's political and social life. And Iran must see that it can reap more benefit from diplomatic and economic engagement than by resuming its disruptive military efforts. Shiite groups have been weakened, but trying to keep them subdued by excluding them from politics will only make them prey for future efforts by Iran to rebuild its proxy network—and imperil any broader vision of regional peace.

            • Defense bill: The House is expected to take up a vote on the annual defense policy bill today, with GOP congressional leaders facing hurdles to muscle the bill through a narrow majority.
    


• Boat strikes: Tucked into the bill is a provision that would limit Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's travel budget unless he provides the House and Senate Armed Services committees with unedited video of US strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean. Meanwhile, the House committee chair is prepared to end his panel's investigation into the September double-tap strike after viewing footage, an aide told CNN.
    


• Ukraine war: President Donald Trump spoke with European leaders amid the effort to broker peace in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said a 20-point plan will be submitted to the US “in the near future.”
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune is holding out a long-shot possibility that a bipartisan compromise could be reached to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies before they expire at the end of the year.
    


            Such an effort would require a dramatic shift in positions from members of both parties and would have to come quickly as the Senate is only scheduled to be in session through next week.
    


            “I don't know. I wouldn't say that,” Thune responded when asked if it was safe to say the subsides will expire. “When we get through this exercise this week, the question is, are there enough Democrats who actually want to solve the problem to work the Republicans, a lot of us who want to fix the problem. Or are they going to succumb to their leadership and probably their far left base and just make this a political issue.”
    


            Thune pointed to conversations between bipartisan rank-and-file members trying to find a path forward that might have success after votes on competing Democratic and Republican health care bills fail Thursday.
    


            “If there's an interest in solving it, I don't rule it out.  I mean, obviously, we don't have a lot of time,” he said.
    


            Thune was asked if he would support using a partisan tool known as reconciliation to pass a GOP health care bill without Democratic votes.
    


            The Republican leader said he would prefer a bipartisan compromise that could get 60 votes to overcome a filibuster because the resulting legislation is “more durable,” but he added: “I wouldn't rule anything out.”
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson declined to comment on whether the full video of September's “double-tap” strike in the Caribbean should be released after missing a Gang of Eight briefing Tuesday where leadership and heads of the Intelligence committees were shown the video and briefed by Cabinet officials.
    


            “So, my admission here is that I was not in the Gang of Eight briefing,” he said, citing meetings on health care being scheduled at the same time.
    


            “I told Secretary [of Defense Pete] Hegseth and Secretary [of State Marco] Rubio I wouldn't make it, so they're going to meet with me individually. So, I have not yet seen that,” he said
    


            Republican leaders touted “productive” discussions on health care in their Wednesday morning conference meeting that would lead to a package coming to the floor next week as Americans are facing jumps in their premiums due to expiring Covid-era Affordable Care Act tax credits.
    


            “The overall system is broken, and we're the ones that are going to fix it. You will see that laid out,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said while not revealing many details of the forthcoming package.
    


            “We're moving those through the regular order process, and that's the way it's supposed to work. So, you'll see many of those processes. We think we can get it all wrapped up by the end of that deadline of January 30th, and you'll see that process continue over the days and weeks ahead as well,” he added.
    


            Johnson indicated any plan Republicans would put on the floor would not include extending the ACA subsidies, saying it “would be a dereliction of duty to just extend subsidies without massive reforms to them.”
    


            The Trump administration is backing the annual defense policy bill, urging lawmakers to pass the National Defense Authorization Act for the next fiscal year despite it including a provision that increases pressure on the Pentagon to turn over videos of its strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.
    


            The NDAA will “protect the homeland, and strengthen the defense industrial base, while eliminating funding for wasteful and radical programs that undermine the warfighting ethos of our Nation's men and women in uniform,” reads a statement of administration policy from the Office of Management and Budget on Tuesday.
    


            The House is expected to take up a vote on the bill Wednesday before it heads to the Senate. The measure sets out the nation's defense policy agenda and authorizes nearly $900 billion in funding for military programs, including a 3.8% pay raise for service members.
    


            “The FY 2026 NDAA refocuses the Department on lethality and restores the warrior ethos. The NDAA eliminates statutory provisions relating to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion offices, programs, training, activities, and authorities in the DoW,” the OMB memo says. “If S. 1071 was presented to the President in its current form, he would sign it into law.”
    


            Tucked into the bill is a provision that would limit Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's travel budget unless he provides the House and Senate Armed Services committees with unedited video of US strikes on alleged drug boats. The House Armed Services chairman is prepared to end his panel's investigation into the September double-tap strike after viewing footage, a committee aide told CNN.
    


            President Donald Trump spoke today with top European leaders amid intensive efforts to broker peace in Ukraine, a person familiar with the call says.
    


            France and the UK confirmed in separate statements that the call took place.
    


            Trump's conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also comes amid deteriorating ties between the US and Europe, as Trump blasted the continent's leaders as “decaying” in an interview this week.
    


            The three European leaders met this week in London with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as proposals go back and forth with Russia on ending its war.
    


            France's Élysée Palace said that in the call, the European leaders commended the US efforts toward a lasting peace in Ukraine, noting that work on this will continue.
    


            A Downing Street spokesperson reiterated these points, writing that the leaders “agreed that this was a critical moment – for Ukraine, its people and for shared security across the Euro-Atlantic region.”
    


            Trump said in the Politico interview on Monday that Zelensky needed to “get on the ball” and “start accepting things,” and criticized the Ukrainian leader for not reading his multi-point peace plan.
    


This post has been updated with additional information. CNN's Joseph Ataman and Max Foster contributed reporting.



            Delegations from Ukraine and the US will today talk about plans for the reconstruction and economic development of Ukraine after the war with Russia ends, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on Telegram.
    


                    “We continue to communicate with all our partners on a daily basis, virtually 24/7, to identify feasible and realistic steps to end the war,” Zelensky said. “Everything must be reliable and dignified for Ukraine.”
                





            The Ukrainians are also “finalizing work on 20 points of a fundamental document that could define the parameters for ending the war,” he said, adding that he expects this plan to be submitted to the US “in the near future.” This will be done after “joint work” with officials from the US and Europe is carried out, he said.
    


            Zelensky yesterday had indicated the possibility of handing over the updated peace proposal to the US today.
    


            Tomorrow, countries who form the so-called “Coalition of the Willing” will be meeting to discuss an end to the war, Zelensky added.
    


                    “This week may bring news for all of us and an end to the bloodshed,” he said. “We believe that there is no alternative to peace, and the key questions are how to force Russia to stop the killings and what specifically will deter Russia from a third invasion.”
                





            House Armed Services Chairman Mike Rogers is prepared to end his panel's investigation into the September double-tap strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean, a committee aide tells CNN.
    


            Rogers received a classified briefing last week to view the video footage and is now pushing for the rest of his panel to be able to see the video.
    


            “The video and classified briefings from the Pentagon were sufficient to convince him this was a legal action. But he's also been clear that we need a classified briefing where the rest of HASC's members can see the video, and we expect that to happen next week,” the committee aide told CNN.
    


            House Republicans are holding a high-stakes meeting this morning to settle on a health care strategy ahead of a critical December 31 deadline for expiring enhanced Obamacare subsidies.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson and his committee chairs today are proposing a handful of smaller-scale measures to lower health care costs — without addressing the billions of dollars in expiring subsidies that is causing panic among GOP battleground members, according to multiple people familiar with the plans.
    


            Their proposals include expanding cost-sharing reduction — a way that helps offset costs for lower-income people by requiring insurers to pay more — and encouraging Association Health Care Plans to allow small businesses to band together to purchase insurance at group rates, those people said.
    


            It would also expand HSA choice accounts, but it is not expected to include major changes to the program.
    


            The conference is expected to weigh the proposals, which are not yet final.
    


            Johnson is under intense pressure from his fellow Republicans to find some way to tackle health care costs as Democrats increasingly hammer the GOP for allowing the enhanced Biden-era subsidies to expire.
    


            But GOP centrists have been vocal that any plan that doesn't address those subsidies — which will lead to steep premium hikes for millions of Americans in a midterm year — is not sufficient.
    


            Energy Secretary Chris Wright argued that President Donald Trump understands Americans' worries over high prices and reiterated the president's claims that the Biden administration is to blame.
    


            “People are frustrated that prices are high. And the president fully gets that, and I think in a live audience like that, everyone there knows it,” Wright said, referring to Trump's speech in Pennsylvania last night.
    


                    “Everything he does is to drive prices down, to grow supply, drive prices down, remove regulations, remove barriers, set Americans free. So, when he sees people and the press beating up on him for high prices, of course, he's bothered by the high prices,” Wright said.
                





For context: A recent CNN fact check showed that average grocery prices rose 0.3% from August to September. And average grocery prices were about 2.7% higher than last year in September. One Pennsylvania resident, Frank Fiore, told CNN's Alayna Treene outside a grocery store this week, “It's all bullsh*t. Nothing has come down. Everything has gone up. Maybe eggs have come down a little, but how many eggs can you eat?”
    


            While the country has seen lower gas prices, Wright blamed higher diesel prices on the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.
    


            “Ukraine has been attacking Russia's refining infrastructure. Russia exports two main things, crucial, that people refine and diesel. So those diesel exports out of Russia are down, and it's made the diesel market much tighter, tighter than the gasoline market,” Wright said.
    


            President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency was only “a little bit successful,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on a podcast yesterday, adding that he would not lead the project again.
    


            The billionaire was a major donor to Trump's presidential election campaign and became a close ally and adviser to his administration.
    


            Musk led the DOGE team in seeking to slash the federal government's budget and workforce in the first five months of Trump's second term.
    


            But the role and his political rhetoric sparked a backlash against him and Tesla, including vandalism of Tesla cars.
    


            “I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically worked on my companies. And they wouldn't have been burning the cars,” Musk said on the podcast with former Trump administration official Katie Miller.
    


                    “We were a little bit successful. We were somewhat successful. We stopped a lot of funding that really just made no sense, that was entirely wasteful,” Musk said.
                





            Asked if he would go back and lead DOGE again, Musk said: “No, I don't think so.”
    


            Musk's work for DOGE also sparked concerns among investors that he was not paying enough attention to Tesla as it faced slowing sales.
    


            Musk and Trump had a bitter public falling out around midyear over the president's sweeping tax and spending bill. But there have been some signs of reconciliation.
    


Some background: DOGE has disbanded with eight months left to its mandate, the Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor told Reuters this month. DOGE claimed to have slashed tens of billions of dollars in expenditures, but it was impossible for outside financial experts to verify that because the unit did not provide a detailed public accounting of its work.
    


            President Donald Trump's first public event today is at 2 p.m. E.T., according to the White House schedule. He will take part in a roundtable in the White House's Roosevelt Room.
    


            Then, at 5 p.m. ET, he is set to greet pastors in the Oval Office.
    


            Both the events are closed to the press, but we'll make sure to bring you any updates on the day's developments from Washington as they happen.
    


As we've reported, Trump made a winding, insult-ridden speech in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, yesterday while delivering remarks on how his administration will improve its standing when it comes to affordability.
    


            Turning now to foreign policy, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky responded to President Donald Trump's remarks during an interview with Politico, where Trump said it was time for an election in Ukraine.
    


            Speaking yesterday, Zelensky said that his country will be ready to hold elections in the next 60-90 days if the US and Europe are able to guarantee security for the vote.
    


            Elsewhere:
    


CNN's Victoria Butenko, Daria Tarasova-Markina, Hira Humayun, Christopher Lamb and Jim Sciutto contributed to this reporting.



            President Donald Trump spoke on how his administration will improve its standing on affordability during remarks in Pennsylvania last night.
    


            He also veered off topic in his long-winded speech, complaining that his prepared remarks were boring, setting off on several expletive-riddled tangents.
    


Here's what he said on the economy:



On the trade war: Trump highlighted his tariff policy and the benefits he said it has brought to Pennsylvania. He also touted his initiative to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime hours.



Blame game: Trump sought to debut a new economic message: Democrats drove up prices, “and we're bringing them down.” But he also called concerns about affordability “a hoax” before acknowledging that he'd been encouraged not to say that because it would be misconstrued. He also maintained that blame for high prices rested on former President Joe Biden, relentlessly mocking his predecessor.
    


Attacking the Fed: Trump renewed attacks on the central bank, seeming to suggest that Fed governors who were appointed under Biden may be illegitimate. From the stage, Trump then asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to look into what could be done. The Fed is expected to announce a third consecutive rate cut today.

            As the US military has undertaken a campaign of attacks against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, at least five people have survived initial strikes ending up in the water after explosions killed fellow crew members and disabled their ships.
    


            But what happened next to the survivors varied greatly – two were detained by the US Navy only to be returned to their home countries, one was left to float in the ocean and is presumed dead, and two more have been at the center of intense scrutiny in recent weeks following reporting that the US military conducted a second strike killing them as they clung to their flipped and damaged boat on September 2.
    


            The contrast in treatment has happened while policy on how the military will handle survivors remains steady, according to defense officials.
    


            That September 2 strike was the first conducted by US forces against alleged drug boats, a campaign that has resulted in the killing of 87 people on 23 boats.
    


            Democratic lawmakers have demanded answers about the follow-up strike with some suggesting that the US military may have violated international law by killing the survivors.
    


            Last week, Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill in closed-door meetings to explain the attack. Bradley was the commander of Joint Special Operations Command at the time of the strike and oversaw the attack; Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and the White House have said Bradley was ultimately the official who directed the follow-on strikes, and that they support his decision.
    


            Bradley told lawmakers he ordered a second strike to destroy the remains of the vessel, killing the two survivors, on the grounds that it appeared that part of the vessel remained afloat because it still held cocaine, CNN has reported. The survivors could hypothetically have floated to safety, been rescued, and carried on with trafficking the drugs, the logic went.
    


            People briefed on the follow-up strike said they were concerned that it could violate the law of armed conflict, which prohibits the execution of an enemy combatant who is “hors de combat,” or taken out of the fight due to injury or surrender.
    


            “They're breaking the law either way,” Sarah Harrison, a former associate general counsel at the Pentagon who now serves as a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group think tank, previously told CNN. “They're killing civilians in the first place, and then if you assume they're combatants, it's also unlawful — under the law of armed conflict, if somebody is ‘hors de combat' and no longer able to fight, then they have to be treated humanely.”
    


            The second time the military found survivors after an initial strike, the response was very different.
    


            On October 16, the US picked up two survivors from an attack in the Caribbean on a submarine alleged to be carrying narcotics, and soon after released them to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia. Two other crew members were killed in the strike.
    


            A US official said the two men were the only survivors after their submersible sunk, meaning they did not have access to the drugs allegedly on board, and they were on life rafts.
    


            Releasing them to their home countries, however, may not have been the Pentagon's first instinct; a New York Times report this week says Defense Department lawyers suggested in a call with State Department officials taking the two survivors to a notorious “mega-prison” in El Salvador where the Trump administration was sending alleged gang members who had been removed from the US. The publication reported that the goal was to avoid having survivors of the strikes end up in the US justice system by bringing them somewhere like Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, for example, where legal questions could arise about the strikes as a whole.
    


            State Department officials were “stunned” by the idea and rejected it, according to the Times, which also reported that there was an October 29 call with diplomats where Defense Department officials described their intent to repatriate any survivors in the future.
    


            “The idea that the Department of War was seeking to keep narco-terrorists out of the U.S. judicial system as a result of surviving a strike on their drug trafficking vessels is completely false and ignores historical battlefield precedent,” Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell told CNN in response to a query about the Times reporting. “Terrorists during Global War on Terror from Iraq and Afghanistan were turned over to the host nation for justice, and the process we're using for narco-terrorists is the same.”
    


            The State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
    


            Hegseth said Saturday at the Reagan National Defense Forum that there “was protocol for dealing with survivors” and that the strike on October 16 was simply “a different circumstance” than the strike that included the follow-up attack that killed survivors.
    


            “We didn't change our protocol, it was just a different circumstance,” Hegseth said. “A couple guys jumped off and swam, from what I understand a ways away. When we struck the submarine a second time, it sunk, and then you had two people that you had to go get, and we had the ability to go get them. We gave them back to their host countries.”
    


            Detaining the men created a potential legal conundrum for the Trump administration. It was not clear under what legal authority the US military could hold the men, and had they remained in US custody they could have challenged their status in court.
    


            The most recent crew member to survive a strike was on one of four boats attacked October 27, initially killing 14 people. CNN reported at the time that the Mexican Navy got a call from the Pentagon informing them there could be a survivor of a US strike in the Pacific Ocean, which surprised Mexican officials given they had not received advance warning of any strikes.
    


            Three days after those strikes, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said there was “no new information” on the survivor and that the Mexican Navy was searching in coordination with maritime protocol, which requires search and rescue efforts for 96 hours. The same US official said that person was treated differently as he was no longer a threat after the strike, although it's unclear why the US military didn't pick up the survivor, as they'd done 11 days before.
    


            The survivor of that strike was not found and is presumed dead. The Pentagon previously had not been counting that individual in its total tally of people killed in the ongoing campaign, but a spokesperson said Monday they were now being included.
    


            The pace of US strikes has slowed considerably, with a gap of 19 days before the most recent attack on December 4.
    


            Hegseth acknowledged that reduced pace in answering a reporter's question during a Cabinet meeting two days prior about the killing of survivors. He said he did not directly order the follow-up strike, but that he supported Bradley and insisted the controversy wouldn't change US plans.
    


            “We've only just begun striking narco boats,” he said.

• Trump's Pennsylvania speech: President Donald Trump sought to debut a new economic message: Democrats drove up prices, “and we're bringing them down.” But he undercut that at times, complaining that his prepared remarks were boring and setting off on long and often insult-ridden tangents.
    


• Boat strikes: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other top administration officials briefed the “Gang of Eight” lawmakers on the controversial “double-tap” strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean.
    


• Another win for Democrats: Eileen Higgins will be the next mayor of Miami, CNN projects, breaking a nearly 30-year Republican streak in the seat and giving Democrats another strong performance during the first year of Trump's second term.
    


Our live coverage of the Trump administration has ended for the day. Get the latest here.



            Republican Rep. Nancy Mace told CNN on Tuesday that her constituents say affordability is the most important issue in South Carolina, contradicting President Donald Trump, who has insisted the issue is a Democrat “hoax.”



                    “It is the number one issue in South Carolina,” Mace told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. “The kitchen table, bread and butter issues that affect everyday, hardworking Americans are what people are focused on right now. And it is the economy. It is wages, it is jobs. It is ‘can I afford this mortgage or this rent?'”
                





            Mace, who is running for governor of South Carolina, also said that she agrees with Trump that the US economy is strong right now. She said she believes the tax breaks in Trump's spending package – the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” – will continue to fuel the economy.
    


            Mace's comments come as Trump tries to blame Democrats and former President Joe Biden for inflation while insisting his administration is working to lower prices.
    


            Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar responded to President Donald Trump's attacks on her tonight, calling the president “a national embarrassment.”
    


                    “Trump's obsession with me is beyond weird. He needs serious help,” Omar, who is the first Somali-American elected to Congress, wrote on social media. “Since he has no economic policies to tout, he's resorting to regurgitating bigoted lies instead.”
                





            Her post on Bluesky came after the president's rambling remarks in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, where he said Omar “does nothing but bitch” and that his administration “ought to get her the hell out” of the United States.
    


            Trump also called Somalia “filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime” and said it is “the worst country in the world.”
    


            President Donald Trump was expected to address how his administration will improve its standing on affordability during remarks tonight in eastern Pennsylvania.
    


            Instead, while touching on the economy, Trump complained that his prepared remarks were boring and set off on several long, unrelated and expletive-riddled tangents during his speech in Mount Pocano.
    


Here's what you should know about his remarks, which lasted more than 90 minutes:



Trump's touts tariffs: Trump opened his speech by highlighting his tariff policy and the benefits he said it has brought to Pennsylvania. He also bragged about his initiative to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime hours.



Blame game: The president sought to debut a new economic message: Democrats drove up prices, “and we're bringing them down.” But he called concerns about affordability “a hoax” before eventually acknowledging that he'd been encouraged not to say that because it'd be misconstrued. The president also maintained that blame for high prices rested on former President Joe Biden, relentlessly mocking his predecessor and calling him names.
    


Attacking the Fed: Trump renewed attacks on the central bank, seeming to suggest that Fed governors who were appointed under Biden may be illegitimate. From the stage, Trump then asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to look into what could be done. The Fed is expected to announce a third consecutive rate cut tomorrow at the conclusion of its two-day December policy meeting.
    


Attack on alleged drug boats: Trump highlighted the recent US strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, drawing loud cheers as he praised the operation in blunt terms. “The missile that knocks the crap out of them,” Trump said, describing the strikes as the crowd erupted into cheers.
    


Railing against Somalis: The president continued to rail against Somali people. He said Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, the first Somali-American elected to Congress in 2018, “does nothing but bitch” and said his administration “ought to get her the hell out” of the United States. He called Somalia “filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime” and said it is “the worst country in the world.”
    


CNN's Adam Cancryn, Alayna Treene and Samantha Delouya contributed reporting. 



            President Donald Trump took a moment during his Mount Pocono rally-style speech in Pennsylvania to highlight the recent US strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, drawing loud cheers as he praised the operation in blunt terms.
    


            “The missile that knocks the crap out of them,” Trump said, describing the strikes as the crowd erupted into cheers.
    


            “And now we're going to do land, because the land is much easier,” the president added.
    


            Trump has previously suggested that the United States is preparing to take new action against alleged drug trafficking networks in Venezuela, saying that efforts for strikes on land will be starting “very soon.”
    


            Trump's comments come as his administration appears to be wavering on its earlier commitment to release full video of a September  “double-tap” strike on an alleged drug boat, footage that reportedly shows US forces killing survivors.
    


            President Donald Trump in an interview published Tuesday conceded that video he's seen of the second strike on an alleged drug boat isn't “pretty,” but defended the strikes as necessary to stop the flow of drugs into the United States.
    


            President Donald Trump traveled to Pennsylvania on Tuesday to tout his economic agenda and try to allay voters' cost-of-living concerns.
    


            But just a few minutes in, he decided he had some other topics to address.
    


            Trump spent the bulk of his 90-minute-plus speech playing his greatest campaign-trail hits and soaking up his supporters' adoration by riffing on everything from the benefits of tariffs, to the perils of Scottish windmills and the intimate details of his golf round with Philadelphia Eagles star Saquon Barkley. He also levied a slew of insults against immigrants and Democratic politicians.
    


            “I haven't read practically anything off the stupid TelePrompter,” Trump mused as he hit the 60-minute mark. “And then my speechwriters, they're getting awards for some of the finest speeches, and I haven't even read them.”
    


            The swing-state appearance marked a return to form for a president who rose to prominence on the strength of his campaign mega-rallies, yet has done little domestic travel since returning to office nearly 11 months ago.
    


            In that interval, Trump's approval ratings have dropped significantly, with polls showing voters increasingly sour on the economy and wary of some of the drastic changes that the administration has enacted across nearly every element of American society.
    


            Worried that Republicans now face a wipeout in next year's midterms, Trump's aides and allies have urged him to restart his travel in an effort to reassure voters he's working to turn their fortunes around.
    


            Yet egged on by the raucous crowd, Trump repeatedly abandoned his prepared remarks — casting aside what the White House had previewed would be a laser-focused speech on the economy in favor of pretty much anything else that came to mind.
    


            “You can give up pencils,” Trump said, concluding one tangent on the merits of steel.
    


            “We have people from all over the world being dumped into our country, the people that aren't wanted in their countries,” he said amid a lengthy diatribe on immigration.
    


            Later, while railing against Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, he declared: “Let me tell you, Black people love Trump.”
    


            It was far from the administration's core economic message. But Trump didn't seem to care.
    


            “I have fun,” he said. “I have fun.”
    


            During remarks tonight in Pennsylvania that were expected to be about the economy, President Donald Trump continued to rail against Minnesota's Somali population, gripes with the community that he has voiced since US Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar became the first Somali-American elected to Congress in 2018.
    


                    “I love this Ilhan Omar, whatever the hell her name is, with the little turban. I love her. She comes in, does nothing but bitch. She's always complaining,” Trump said, as he was greeted by laughter and applause by the crowd in Mount Pocano.
                





            He went on to attack Somalia as “the worst country in the world,” claiming that “they have no military.”
    


            “They have no parliament,” the president incorrectly claimed. “They don't know what the hell the word parliament means. They have nothing. They have no police. They police themselves. They kill each other all the time.”
    


            Trump said his administration “ought to get her the hell out” of the United States, referring to Omar, to which the crowd could be heard chanting: “Send her back.”
    


            Later in his remarks, Trump circled back to more attacks on Somalia, grouping it with other countries he called “hellholes” like Afghanistan and Haiti.
    


            He mentioned that during a meeting during his first term with lawmakers, he posed a question: “Why is it we only take people from sh*t-hole countries? Why can't we have some people from Norway, Sweden? Just a few. Let us have a few. From Denmark?”
    


            He continued: “We always take people from Somalia, places that are a disaster, right? Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime. The only thing they are good at is going after ships.”
    


This post has been updated with more remarks about Somalia by Trump. 



            President Donald Trump tonight touted his initiative to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime hours during a speech that was meant to focus on improving the administration's standing on affordability.
    


            During a wide-ranging speech in Pennsylvania, the president pointed out people in the crowd in Mount Pocano who he said have benefited from the initiative.
    


            The president mentioned a worker, a Marine Corps veteran, who put in more than 400 hours of overtime and who he said will now “take home thousands of dollars extra, which he plans to use to buy a first home.”
    


            He also called a woman up onstage, a mother who homeschools her children, who said her family will benefit from Trump's policies.
    


            “The no tax on tips is incredible. No tax on overtime is incredible for my husband,” the woman said, as she stood beside Trump. “It all comes back to our family. It saves us and it's for the future of our children.”
    


            Trump also went on to tout his administration's move to create investment accounts for all newborns in the country. He said $1,000 will be invested for each child with the hope of growing over their life.
    


            “Friends, family, employers and loved ones will be able to add thousands of dollars a year, and it's like a trust fund for every American child. It's going to be something and it's really exciting.”
    


            President Donald Trump, speaking during one of the few rally-style domestic speeches since returning to office, easily slid back into 2024 campaign mode Tuesday evening, including training his attacks on one man he blames for high prices: former President Joe Biden.
    


            Trump relentlessly mocked his predecessor during his remarks in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania — a speech that was meant to focus on improving the administration's standing on affordability, which is an issue his team has acknowledged is a problem for the GOP.
    


            Trump's officials have advised him to publicly recognize the economic pain Americans are feeling. There were flickers during his speech when he appeared to almost acknowledge that pain, but then he'd quickly claim responsibility lies with Biden and that prices are “coming down immensely.”
    


            “Democrats are like ‘prices are too high.' Yeah, they're too high because they cause them to be too high. But now they're coming down,” Trump told the crowd.
    


            The president — who frequently noted he was veering off the teleprompter — also fell into old patterns by using his 2024 name for Biden, “Sleepy Joe,” while accusing him of overusing an autopen.
    


            President Donald Trump on Tuesday sought to debut a new economic message: Democrats drove up prices, “and we're bringing them down.”
    


            But even he didn't seem fully convinced.
    


            Trump at multiple points during his Pennsylvania speech undercut his own messaging, complained that his prepared remarks were boring and set off on long unrelated tangents.
    


            “If I read what's on the teleprompter, you'd all be falling asleep right now,” Trump said just minutes into a speech meant to reenergize voters about his economic agenda.
    


            A few minutes later, he derided the cost-of-living issues that he'd traveled to the swing state to talk about, calling concerns about affordability “a hoax.”
    


            “They always have a hoax,” Trump said, reprising his claims that voters' worries about rising costs were a political ploy manufactured by Democrats. “The new word is affordability.”
    


            The president eventually acknowledged that he'd been encouraged not to call affordability issues a “hoax” because it'd be misconstrued. But even then, he insisted that Democrats were unfairly blaming him for rising prices.
    


            “I agree the prices were too high,” Trump said. “They say affordability. And everyone says, ‘Oh, that must mean Trump has high prices.' No, our prices are coming down tremendously.”
    


            Trump's trip to Pennsylvania marked the first of what the White House has promised will be a string of rallies around the country to tout his agenda and boost Republican lawmakers on the ballot next year.
    


            The administration has sought to reboot its economic message, prompted by polls show increasing unhappiness with Trump's performance on cost-of-living issues.
    


            But Trump said Tuesday that it was his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, who had to convince him to start traveling again.
    


            “The chief of staff, and she's fantastic, she said, ‘We have to start campaigning, sir,'” Trump said. “I said, ‘Already?' They said, ‘We have to win the midterms and you're the guy that's going to take us over the midterm.'”
    


            President Donald Trump has been a frequent critic of the Federal Reserve since taking office. In a Tuesday speech focused on affordability, he renewed attacks on the central bank, seeming to suggest that Fed governors who were appointed under former President Joe Biden may be illegitimate.
    


            “I just heard that all four commissioners, including ‘Too Late'… I hear that the autopen may have signed those commissioners,” Trump said. “If they signed those commissioners… I think it's something we have to look into. You put people there that are not authorized to be there.”
    


            From the stage, Trump then asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to look into what could be done.
    


            It is unclear whether Trump's comments were serious, but this is not the first time the president has challenged the Fed's independence.
    


            Trump has taken to calling Fed Chair Jerome Powell ‘Too Late,' due to Trump's belief that the Fed hasn't lowered interest rates quickly enough.  Powell was nominated by Trump in 2017 during his first term and was reappointed by Biden for a second term in 2021.
    


            Biden appointed four other governors to the Federal Reserve: Michael Barr, Lisa Cook, Philip Jefferson and Adriana Kugler, who has since stepped down.
    


            Earlier this year, Trump fired Cook, accusing her of mortgage fraud. Cook has sued, denying the allegation and arguing that the president lacks the authority to remove a Fed governor. The central bank is meant to operate independently and reports to Congress, not the president.
    


            Trump has often mentioned Biden's use of an autopen in an effort to delegitimize his predecessor's actions as president.
    


            House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said GOP leadership is planning to present the final pieces of a health care plan to the Republican conference Wednesday with the hope of holding a vote next week.
    


            Scalise said leadership had been meeting Tuesday with various committee chairs and members “to go through a number of pieces” for a plan to soften the blow of expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies.
    


            “We're going to be presenting a lot of this to our full conference tomorrow, and then ultimately, have a very detailed conversation with our members tomorrow to decide which things we're ready to move on next week,” he told reporters Tuesday night.
    


            Scalise did not divulge any details of the plan but said they may have more details to reveal after meeting with the conference.
    


            President Donald Trump opened his speech on affordability Tuesday by highlighting his tariff policy and the benefits he says it has brought to Pennsylvania, where he is speaking.
    


            “We've taken in hundreds of billions of dollars, really trillions,” Trump said. “If you add to that all of the companies that are pouring their money into building plants in Pennsylvania and many other states. Auto plants, AI plants, plants of every type, which we would have never had if we didn't put the tariffs on.”
    


            It's true that the US government has taken in billions of dollars from Trump's tariffs so far this year. If existing tariffs remain in place, the US government will raise about $2.3 trillion between 2026 and 2035, according to the Tax Policy Center.
    


            However, many economists warn that tariffs are already contributing to higher prices for some goods, and more companies have warned they will hike prices if tariffs stay in place.
    


            President Donald Trump is now delivering remarks at the Mount Airy Casino Resort in Mt. Pocono, Pennsylvania.
    


            It's in a swing district in eastern Pennsylvania and the first of many planned domestic trips the White House is organizing for Trump to speak on the economy, which it believes will be the key decider in next year's midterms.
    


                    “Affordability” has become a buzzword among leaders in both parties in recent months, with each side trying to win the messaging war and deflect blame over the financial strain felt by millions of Americans.
                





            For Trump, who promised a new age of economic prosperity in his campaign, it's a test of his ability to deliver, as GOP lawmakers prepare for an uphill battle defending their House and Senate majorities.
    


            We're about to provide you with live updates from President Donald Trump's remarks in Pennsylvania on affordability.
    


These are other political headlines from CNN that you should know about: 



            Ahead of President Donald Trump's planned speech on affordability, CNN asked people at a local grocery store how they felt about his economic policy — and whether they agreed with his assessment that his work on the issue was “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.”
    


                    “No, no, no, no, no. It's no A-plus-plus,” said Sue Mary. “I mean, it's not terrible. I mean, I'd give it a C, but besides that, it's not great.”
                





            Patti Frable said she similarly disagreed with Trump's glowing self-review, which he offered in an interview with Politico.
    


            “The economy, it's really rough right now, prices are so high, it's paycheck to paycheck,” she said.
    


            But Mike Ceci offered a more rosy assessment: Maybe just lose the pluses.
    


            “That's Trump opening his mouth too much,” he said, adding, “I would give him an A. You know, there's always room for improvement.”
    


            A former Trump criminal defense attorney and Justice Department official turned federal appellate judge is attending the president's speech at the Mount Airy Casino Resort.
    


            CNN spotted Emil Bove, who Trump appointed to the bench for the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals, in the crowd at the event, the first of many planned domestic trips the president intends to take in the coming months to speak about affordability.
    


            It is unusual for a federal appellate judge to attend political events like these. Federal appellate judges enjoy lifetime appointments, in part to insulate them from partisan politics.
    


            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called today's briefing from Trump administration officials “very unsatisfying” and indicated Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is still reviewing whether to allow lawmakers to see unedited video of the September 2 double-tap strike on a suspected drug boat in the Caribbean.
    


                    “It was a very unsatisfying briefing,” Schumer said. “I asked Secretary Hegseth, Secretary of Defense Hegseth, would he let every member of Congress see the unedited videos of the September 2nd strike? His answer: ‘We have to study it.' Well, in my view, they've studied it long enough. Congress ought to be able to see it.”
                





            Schumer said Tuesday he also asked the officials about the US' strategy in Venezuela but “again did not get satisfying answers at all.”
    


            The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner, said after the briefing he's still reluctant to “reach a final conclusion” on whether the Trump administration's actions in the Caribbean were legal or appropriate or not. “Once you reach those conclusions, you can't, you can't take it back,” he explained.
    


            Warner said he's requested the Trump administration turn over various documents, including execution orders, documents surrounding communications, and legal opinions.
    


            “So far, I've not got those answers. I did not get a complete refusal, but I got inadequate answers that I've got to have, and frankly, I think members of Congress deserve,” he said.
    


            “And for that matter, if all of this is not going to be shared with the American public, members of Congress need to make judgments, and we've got to have all those documents, and sure as heck, the videos themselves need to be seen, I believe, by the American public, but at the very least by all members of Congress,” Warner added.
    


            Hegseth did not comment as he left the US Capitol.
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters after the briefing he still has not seen the video of the double-tap strike.
    


            GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy said Tuesday he isn't expecting any Democrats to support his legislation to address health care costs, an indication even Republicans know the plan they are putting up for a floor vote this week will fail.
    


            “So far, no,” he told CNN when asked whether he thinks Democrats will get on board with his proposal.
    


            Senate Republican leaders plan to put Cassidy's bill, written with Senate Finance Chairman Mike Crapo, up for a floor vote on Thursday alongside a vote on Democrats' bill to extend expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies for three years.
    


            The Cassidy-Crapo plan does not extend the expiring subsidies. It seeks to alleviate health care costs by depositing payments to Americans' health savings accounts.
    


            Neither plan is expected to meet the 60-vote threshold needed to advance.
    


            Pressed by CNN on why he won't hammer out a bipartisan proposal with Democrats given the expiring ACA subsidy issue, Cassidy told reporters, “It takes two to tango.”
    


            He argued Democrats' plan only helps insurance companies, not Americans burdened by high health costs.
    


            “Why would Democrats want to give all the money to the insurance company as opposed to all the money to the patient? Why do they want them to have a $6,000 deductible as opposed to money in their purse, pocketbook, account by which to pay those initial expenses? That should be the basis for a bipartisan agreement. So far not,” Cassidy said.
    


            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Tuesday called on the Trump administration to release to the public video of the September double-tap strike on a suspected drug vessel.
    


            “The full video of the double-tap strike should be released to the American people, so that the American people have an opportunity to determine for themselves whether that strike killing people who were shipwrecked and by all accounts were not presenting any threat to American military personnel – whether that kind of seemingly extrajudicial killing is consistent with American values,” Jeffries said.
    


            He continued, “If Pete Hegseth and the administration think that their actions are justifiable, what are they hiding from the American people? Release the video.”
    


            Jeffries' comments came before he headed to a briefing that top Trump administration officials are giving to congressional leaders, expected to be on a range of topics.

            The US has indicted a Ukrainian woman for her alleged involvement with Russia-backed cybercriminal groups that have caused disruptions at American water and meat processing facilities, the Justice Department has said.
    


            The case against Victoria Dubranova, 33, who was extradited to the US earlier this year and pleaded not guilty in court on Tuesday, is a counterpunch from US law enforcement following years of cyberattacks on US victims from two shadowy groups of hackers that gained notoriety following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
    


            One of the groups, known as the Cyber Army of Russia Reborn (CARR), has claimed responsibility for hundreds of cyberattacks worldwide, including a hack in January 2024 in the town of Muleshoe, Texas, that wasted tens of thousands of gallons of water. Another attack by the group spoiled thousands of pounds of meat at a processing facility in Los Angeles in November 2024, causing an ammonia leak, the Justice Department said.
    


            The groups have forced water plant managers in small towns in the US to confront opportunistic attacks from hackers supportive of Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.
    


            US prosecutors allege that Russia's GRU intelligence agency founded and funded CARR. The other hacking group, called NoName057, drew from members of an IT organization established by Putin's order in 2018, according to the Justice Department.
    


            Indictments in the US Central District of California charge Dubranova with conspiracy to damage protected computers and tamper with public water systems, among other charges. She has pleaded not guilty, the Justice Department said. An attorney for Dubranova was not listed in court records.
    


            “This is not a norm for us … to be able to obtain pro-Russian hacktivists and then have them successfully extradited to the United States,” Brett Leatherman, assistant director of the FBI's Cyber Division, told reporters on Wednesday.
    


            He hailed an increase in the number of arrests in recent months “related to cyber fugitives in both traditional and non-traditional partner countries.”
    


            Thai authorities in November arrested a Russian man at the FBI's request for allegedly supporting Russian cyber-espionage campaigns against US organizations.
    


            Dubranova's alleged role in the pro-Russian hacking groups highlights how Russia has allegedly co-opted tech-savvy Ukrainians who are sympathetic to Moscow to support the Kremlin's interests.
    


            The two pro-Russian hacking groups have targeted unsecured industrial computers that allow the hackers to interact with water pumps and other critical machinery. The groups often boast about their exploits on a Telegram channel while posting pro-Russia content. It's partly a psychological operation designed to drum up interest in the group and spread panic among targets.
    


            The threat remains. US government agencies on Tuesday warned that such pro-Russian hacking groups are “actively engaging in opportunistic, low-sophistication malicious cyber activity across multiple sectors.”
    


            “While these attacks may be relatively unsophisticated, they pose real risks to our water systems, food supply and energy sectors,” Leatherman said.
    


            The pro-Russian hackers have continued, as recently as this week, to claim new US victims on their Telegram channel.
    


            The charges against Dubranova come as the US continues to try to strike a deal to end the war between Russia and Ukraine.
    


            Tuesday's actions show the Justice Department's “commitment to disrupting malicious Russian cyber activity — whether conducted directly by state actors or their criminal proxies — aimed at furthering Russia's geopolitical interests,” Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Eisenberg said in a statement.
    


            In their public persona, CARR's members often lend the appearance of a grassroots, patriotic Russian organization. But the Justice Department says the GRU has instructed CARR members on what organizations to hack.
    


            “The GRU is increasingly leaning into willing accomplices to hide their own hand in destabilizing physical and cyberattacks in Europe and the US,” John Hultquist, chief analyst at Google Threat Intelligence Group, told CNN.“It's important that we never take an adversary's word for it when they tell us who they are. They frequently lie.”
    


            US and Russian officials have had minimal and sporadic cooperation over the years on cybercrime. Washington is wary of what US officials say is Russian intelligence's cozy relationship with Russian cybercriminals.
    


            But even today, the FBI's Leatherman said, US law enforcement and security officials still pass information to their Russian counterparts when it makes sense.
    


            “We continue to provide law enforcement and national security information to the Russians when we believe there's an opportunity to mitigate a threat to the homeland here or help them take action in country,” he said.

The Trump administration must stop deploying the California National Guard in Los Angeles and return control of the troops to the state, a federal judge ruled Wednesday. 

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco granted a preliminary injunction sought by California officials who opposed President Donald Trump's extraordinary move to use state Guard troops without the governor's approval to further his immigration enforcement efforts. But he also put the decision on hold until Monday.

California argued that conditions in Los Angeles had changed since Trump first took command of the troops and deployed them in June. The administration initially called up more than 4,000 California National Guard troops, but that number had dropped to several hundred by late October, with only a 100 or so troops remaining in the Los Angeles area.

But the Republican administration extended the deployment until February while also trying to use California Guard members in Portland, Oregon as part of its effort to send the military into Democratic-run cities despite fierce resistance from mayors and governors.

U.S. Justice Department lawyers said the administration still needed Guard members in the Los Angeles area to help protect federal personnel and property.

In a briefing the day after her historic win as the first woman elected mayor of the south Florida metropolis, Eileen Higgins decried elected officials' use of “language that is demeaning, that is cruel, that is disrespectful about the people who live in the city of Miami.”

She also called Miami “the tip of the spear of the affordability crisis in America.”

Campaigning as a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan race, Higgins on Tuesday defeated a Republican endorsed by Trump, ending Democrats' nearly three-decade losing streak leading the Hispanic-majority city. Higgins said she has heard of many people in Miami who were worried about family members being detained.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has kicked off a series of meetings with British and Australian counterparts in Washington that are aimed at moving forward with the large nuclear submarine building and technology sharing pact between the three nations known as known as AUKUS.

Ahead of the meetings, the British defense minister said he's “all in” following a U.S. review of the deal.

“Those reviews are now done,” U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey told reporters Wednesday. He added that “all three of us are now determined to reboot AUKUS with a new commitment and a new determination in particular to deliver.”

The deal was originally inked in 2021. The Pentagon recently determined that the agreement was in the U.S. national security interest.

It includes the sale of three U.S.-built nuclear-powered submarines to Australia starting in 2032.

“I'm absolutely delighted that Jasmine Crockett is running for Senate in Texas,” Johnson said, eagerly rubbing his hands together.

The House GOP speaker called the liberal firebrand “the face of the Democratic Party,” and compared Crockett to New York's new mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.

“Good luck with that,” he said. “What Jasmine is trying to sell will not be purchased by the folks in Texas, that is my prediction.”

He said, “I want her to have the largest, loudest microphone that she can every single day,” he said, “and we look forward to having that election down there.”

A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration must end the California National Guard deployment in Los Angeles. Other deployments are being challenged in court. Here are the other U.S. cities where troops remain:

The Republican speaker said he missed the classified briefing with Hegseth and Rubio this week because he was working with House GOP lawmakers on their emerging health care proposals.

Johnson would not say if the video should be widely released, in part because he said he had not viewed it.

“We'll see,” he said.

Because of his timing conflict with the classified briefing, he said Hegseth and Rubio would meet with him separately at a later date.

Marco Rubio has ordered that all diplomatic correspondence must return to the more traditional Times New Roman font.

It reverses a Biden-era shift to the less formal typeface that Rubio said was wasteful, confusing and unbefitting the dignity of official U.S. government documents.

His cable sent to all U.S. embassies and consulates Tuesday said the 2023 shift to the sans serif Calibri font was the result of misguided diversity, equity and inclusion policies pursued by his predecessor, Antony Blinken. Rubio's cable, obtained by The Associated Press, said Blinken's switch “was promised to mitigate accessibility issues for individuals with disabilities.”

It says the change had cost the department $145,000 but offered no supporting evidence. The cable was first reported by The New York Times.

The vice president is expected to give a speech in Allentown in the vein of Trump's remarks last night to focus on the economy and assure voters that the administration is working to address inflation, according to his office.

A three-year extension of expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits would increase federal deficits by nearly $83 billion over the next decade, according to a new estimate from the Congressional Budget Office.

The Senate will vote on competing health plans on Thursday. The three-year extension of the subsidy is being pitched by Senate Democrats, but it is not expected to pass.

The CBO also estimates that enacting the Democratic plan would increase the number of people with health insurance by about 400,000 next year, 3 million in 2027 and 4 million in 2028.

Gross premiums, the amount consumers would pay before a tax credit is applied, have already been set for 2026. But CBO says they would fall by 5.7% in 2027 and 9% in 2028, because people who enroll in ACA plans would be healthier than they would be without the extension.

Trump took command in June following protests over his efforts to carry out mass deportations. California sued, and Breyer issued a temporary restraining order that required the administration to return control of the Guard members to California. An appeals court put that decision on hold. Then in September, Breyer ruled after a trial that the deployment was illegal.

California argued that the president was using Guard members as his personal police force in violation of a law limiting the use of the military in domestic affairs.

The administration said courts can't second-guess the president's decision that violence during the protests made it impossible for him to execute U.S. laws with regular forces, and reflected a rebellion, or danger of rebellion.

Other judges have blocked the administration's deployments to Portland, Oregon, and Chicago.

The Trump administration must return control of the troops to the state, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco ruled Wednesday. 

Breyer granted a preliminary injunction against Trump's extraordinary move to use state Guard troops without the governor's approval. He put the decision on hold until Monday.

California argued that conditions in Los Angeles had changed since Trump first took command of the troops and deployed them in June. The administration initially called up more than 4,000 California National Guard troops. By late October, only a 100 or so remained in the Los Angeles area. Justice Department lawyers said they are still needed to protect federal personnel and property.

The Republican administration extended the deployment until February while also trying to use California Guard members in Portland, Oregon. 

Secret grand jury transcripts from Jeffrey Epstein's 2019 sex trafficking case can be made public, a judge ruled Wednesday, joining two other judges in granting the requests involving investigations into the late financier's sexual abuse.

U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman reversed his earlier decision, citing a new law that requires the government to open its files on Epstein and his longtime confidant Ghislaine Maxwell. The judge previously cautioned that the 70 or so pages of grand jury materials slated for release are hardly revelatory.

Different judges ordered the release of records from Maxwell's 2021 sex trafficking case and from an abandoned Epstein federal grand jury investigation in the 2000s.

The Epstein Files Transparency Act Trump signed last month created a narrow exception to rules that normally keep grand jury proceedings confidential.

According to a Harris aide, the 2024 Democratic nominee's national tour will not focus as heavily on her defeat to Trump and her resulting campaign memoir, “107 Days.” Instead, Harris will talk about the state of the country, what she's heard from voters during the first leg of her book tour and future solutions to national problems.

The shift could fuel speculation about her 2028 presidential ambitions. Harris announced 15 tour stops beginning Jan. 13 in New Orleans and continuing through March 3 in her hometown of Oakland, California.

That's where she announced her unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 2019. She dropped out before nominating contests began but Joe Biden tapped her as his running mate in 2020, and she was elected as the first woman to hold national office.

Rep. Haley Stevens said in a video posted on X Wednesday that the Health and Human Services secretary “has got to go.”

Stevens, who is running for Michigan's open U.S. Senate seat, calls Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “the biggest, self-created threat to our health and safety,” citing “skyrocketing” health care costs and the “gutting” of research.

Stevens, who represents a suburban Detroit district, is part of House Democrats' 2019 freshman class that flipped dozens of Republican-held seats to deliver a Democratic majority that reshaped Trump's first presidency, including twice impeaching him.

Narrowly defeating her opponent in 2020, she cruised to reelection in 2022 and 2024 after her district was redrawn and became more favorable to Democrats.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino's public support for Trump and a peace prize awarded to the U.S. president are the subjects of formal complaints to the global soccer body's ethics investigators.

FairSquare, a London-based human rights nonprofit, said Tuesday it filed requests for investigations into Infantino's alleged breaches of FIFA's statutory duty to be politically neutral. FIFA said its ethics committee does not comment on potential ongoing cases, and could not confirm receiving the complaint.

FIFA's ethics code calls for a ban from soccer of up to two years for violating the duty of neutrality. But it's unclear if FIFA's current ethics investigators and judges will take up the case — they're seen by some observers to operate with less independence than their predecessors a decade ago when then-president Sepp Blatter was removed from office.

The outgoing comptroller of New York City is challenging U.S. Rep. Dan Goldman in a Democratic primary for a liberal district in lower Manhattan and northwest Brooklyn.

Brad Lander, a progressive ally of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, in a video and social media posts promised Wednesday to offer “courageous leadership in the face of Donald Trump's attacks on New Yorkers.”

Lander scheduled a public speech about his campaign Wednesday evening near his home in Brooklyn. He's has been eyeing a challenge to Goldman since he lost the Democratic mayoral primary to Mamdani this summer.

Lander and Mamdani endorsed one another during the mayoral primary in an effort, as part of the city's ranked choice voting system, to join forces against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who at the time was the front-runner.

A Dallas congresswoman opened her Senate campaign by telling voters that she “has gone toe to toe with Donald Trump.” Her Democratic primary opponent insisted that Americans are tired of “politics as a blood sport.”

The divergent approach highlights how U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett and state Rep. James Talarico are navigating a race where Democrats hope to break a three-decade losing streak in Texas. It also reflects a broader divide within the party, with some candidates continuing to focus on Trump while others barely mention his name.

Figuring out the best approach will be critical for Democrats who are seeking control of Congress next year and already maneuvering for the 2028 presidential race.

The bigger question for financial markets and the economy is what Chair Jerome Powell may signal Wednesday regarding the central bank's next steps.

This would be the third cut in a row and bring the Fed's key rate to about 3.6%, the lowest in nearly three years. For Americans struggling with high borrowing costs for homes, cars, and other large purchases, rate cuts could reduce those costs over time — though it's not guaranteed.

This week's meeting could presage a much cloudier path ahead. The government shutdown delayed two months of jobs and inflation data, leaving the Fed with much less information on hiring and inflation. And with Powell's term as chair ending in May, Trump will nominate a replacement, possibly as soon as this month, who will almost certainly push for lower borrowing costs.

Mega billionaire Elon Musk says he would not run the Department of Government Efficiency again, and he assesses the overall effort as only “somewhat successful.”

Musk made his comments to Katie Miller, a conservative operative who works for Musk and is married to Trump adviser Stephen Miller.

“I don't think so,” Musk said when she asked on her podcast whether he'd start the now-shuttered agency again. 

The SpaceX and Tesla CEO, who also owns X, said he'd focus on business instead. 

Musk said DOGE identified billions in “zombie payments” but wasn't able to enact his promised sweeping reduction of the federal footprint.

Musk acknowledged that his businesses, especially Tesla, faced backlash because of DOGE's unpopularity. Things turned in his favor after he left the Trump administration. Tesla shareholders approved a pay package that could make Musk the world's first trillionaire.

Emboldened by recent elections, Democrats are adding more Republican-held House districts to 2026 midterm target list.

Several additions result from recent gerrymandering by state legislatures: Republican Darrell Issa's California district, North Carolina seats held by Republicans Greg Murphy and Chuck Edwards, and a newly drawn open seat in Texas.

Sacramento Democrats redrew Issa's seat to their favor. Murphy's and Edwards' districts also became less solidly Republican when GOP lawmakers in Raleigh strengthened Republican chances elsewhere. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also added Florida Republican Laurel Lee's district.

Trump won there and in the newly added Texas seat by double digits in 2024, but Democrats note that in elections across the country this year, their candidates made double-digit gains compared to the presidential election.

Republicans in Florida have found strong support from voters with heritage from Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua as they likened Democratic leaders to the governments they fled.

But U.S. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, a Republican whose district is being targeted by Democrats and includes the city of Miami, said Hispanics also want a secure border, a healthy economy and some relief for “those who have been here for years and do not have a criminal record.”

“The Hispanic vote is not guaranteed,” Salazar said in a video post after Democratic wins in New Jersey and Virginia. “Hispanics married President Trump, but they are only dating the GOP.”

Democrat David Jolly, running for Florida governor, celebrated the results in Miami: “Change is here. It's sweeping the nation, and it's sweeping Florida.” 

Voters elected Eileen Higgins by a margin of about 19 percentage points on Tuesday, defeating a Republican endorsed by President Donald Trump to end her party's nearly three-decade losing streak and give Democrats a boost in one of the last electoral battles ahead of the 2026 midterms.

“We are facing rhetoric from elected officials that is so dehumanizing and cruel, especially against immigrant populations,” Higgins told The Associated Press after her victory speech in the Hispanic-majority city that may become the home of Trump's presidential library. “The residents of Miami were ready to be done with that.”

The victory provides Democrats with some momentum as the GOP looks to keep its grip in Florida. “Tonight's result is yet another warning sign to Republicans that voters are fed up with their out-of-touch agenda that is raising costs,” Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin said in a statement.

The U.S. military flew a pair of fighter jets over the Gulf of Venezuela on Tuesday in what appears to be the closest American warplanes have come to the South American country's airspace since the start of the Trump administration's pressure campaign.

Public flight tracking websites showed a pair of U.S. Navy F/A-18 fighter jets fly over the Gulf and spending more than 30 minutes flying over water. A U.S. defense official confirmed that a pair of jets conducted a “routine training flight” in the area.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military operations, could not say if the jets were armed but noted that they stayed in international airspace during their flight.

The flights are the latest action the U.S. military has taken as it has built up its largest presence in the region in decades and launched a series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean. President Donald Trump says land attacks are coming soon but has not offered any details on location.

Not long after Trump took office in January, staff at CentroNía bilingual preschool began rehearsing what to do if Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials came to the door.

In October, the school scrapped its beloved Hispanic Heritage Month parade. ICE had begun stopping staff members, all of whom have legal status, and school officials worried about drawing more unwelcome attention.

All of this transpired before ICE officials arrested a teacher inside a Spanish immersion preschool in Chicago in October. The event left immigrants who work in child care, along with the families who rely on them, feeling frightened and vulnerable.

Trump's push for the largest mass deportation in history has had an outsized impact on the child care field, which is heavily reliant on immigrants and already strained by a worker shortage. Immigrant child care workers and preschool teachers, the majority of whom are working and living in the U.S. legally, say they are wracked by anxiety over possible encounters with ICE officials. Some have left the field, and others have been forced out by changes to immigration policy.

Trump admitted Tuesday that he used the slur “shithole countries” to disparage Haiti and African nations during a 2018 meeting with lawmakers, bragging about a comment that sparked global outrage during his first term.

Back then, Trump had denied making the contemptuous statement during a closed-door meeting, but on Tuesday, he showed little compunction reliving it during a rally in Pennsylvania. He went on to further disparage Somalia as “filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.”

Trump was boasting in his speech that he had last week “announced a permanent pause on Third World migration, including from hellholes like Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia and many other countries,” when someone in the crowd yelled out the 2018 remark.

That prompted him to recall the 2018 incident. His telling hewed closely to the description offered at the time by people who were briefed on the Oval Office meeting.

The White House at the time did not deny Trump's remarks, but the president posted on Twitter the day after the news broke that “this was not the language I used.” He added that he “never said anything derogatory about Haitians.”

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told congressional leaders Tuesday that he was still weighing whether to release the full video of an attack on an alleged drug boat that killed two survivors, even as he faced intensifying demands from Congress for disclosure.

Hegseth provided a classified briefing for congressional leaders alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe at the Capitol. Inside the secure room, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer asked the defense secretary whether he would allow every member of Congress to view the video of the attack from September.

Schumer said Hegseth's response was: “We have to study it.”

Lawmakers are demanding a full accounting from the Department of Defense on the military campaign and the particular attack that killed two people who were clinging to the wreckage of an initial strike. Legal experts say that action may have violated the laws governing the use of deadly military force. The situation has awakened the Republican-controlled Congress to its oversight role after months of frustration about the trickle of information from the Pentagon.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Not long after President Donald Trump took office in January, staff at CentroNía bilingual preschool began rehearsing what to do if Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials came to the door. As ICE became a regular presence in their historically Latino neighborhood this summer, teachers stopped taking children to nearby parks, libraries and playgrounds that had once been considered an extension of the classroom. 

And in October, the school scrapped its beloved Hispanic Heritage Month parade, when immigrant parents typically dressed their children in costumes and soccer jerseys from their home countries. ICE had begun stopping staff members, all of whom have legal status, and school officials worried about drawing more unwelcome attention.

All of this transpired before ICE officials arrested a teacher inside a Spanish immersion preschool in Chicago in October. The event left immigrants who work in child care, along with the families who rely on them, feeling frightened and vulnerable.

Trump's push for the largest mass deportation in history has had an outsized impact on the child care field, which is heavily reliant on immigrants and already strained by a worker shortage. Immigrant child care workers and preschool teachers, the majority of whom are working and living in the U.S. legally, say they are wracked by anxiety over possible encounters with ICE officials. Some have left the field, and others have been forced out by changes to immigration policy.

At CentroNía, CEO Myrna Peralta said all staff must have legal status and work authorization. But ICE's presence and the fear it generates have changed how the school operates.




“That really dominates all of our decision making,” Peralta said.

Instead of taking children on walks through the neighborhood, staff members push children on strollers around the hallways. And staff converted a classroom into a miniature library when the school scrapped a partnership with a local library.

Schools and child care centers were once off limits to ICE officials, in part to keep children out of harm's way. But those rules were scrapped not long after Trump's inauguration. Instead, ICE officials are urged to exercise “common sense.” 

Tricia McLaughlin, spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, defended ICE officials' decision to enter the Chicago preschool. She said the teacher, who had a work permit and was later released, was a passenger in a car that was being pursued by ICE officials. She got out of the car and ran into the preschool, McLaughlin said, emphasizing the teacher was “arrested in the vestibule, not in the school.” The man who had been driving went inside the preschool, where officials arrested him.

About one-fifth of America's child care workers were born outside the United States and one-fifth are Latino. The proportion of immigrants in some places, particularly large cities, is much higher: In the District of Columbia, California and New York, around 40% of the child care workforce is foreign-born, according to UC Berkeley's Center for the Study of Child Care Employment.

Immigrants in the field tend to be better educated than those born in the United States. Those from Latin America help satisfy the growing demand for Spanish-language preschools, such as CentroNía, where some parents enroll their kids to give them a head start learning another language. 

The American Immigration Council estimated in 2021 that more than three-quarters of immigrants working in early care and education were living and working in the U.S. legally. Preschools like CentroNía conduct rigorous background checks, including verifying employees have work authorization. 

There is evidence the toll on the workforce is mounting. Since January, the number of immigrants working in child care has dropped by 39,000, according to a report published Wednesday by New America, a left-leaning think tank. This, in turn, made it more challenging for U.S.-born mothers of children under 6 to work. The researchers estimate there are 79,000 fewer of them in the workforce because of the increase in ICE arrests. 

Beyond the deportation efforts, the Trump administration in recent months has stripped legal status from hundreds of thousands of immigrants. Many of them had fled violence, poverty or natural disasters in their homes and received Temporary Protected Status, which allowed them to live and work legally in the U.S. But Trump ended those programs, forcing many out of their jobs — and the country. Just last month, 300,000 immigrants from Venezuela lost their protected status.

CentroNía lost two employees when they lost their TPS, Peralta said, and a Nicaraguan immigrant working as a teacher left on his own. Tierra Encantada, which runs Spanish immersion preschools in several states, had a dozen teachers leave when they lost their TPS.

At CentroNía, one staff member was detained by ICE while walking down the street and held for several hours, all the while unable to contact colleagues to let them know where she was. She was released that evening, said the school's site director, Joangelee Hernández-Figueroa.

Another staff member, teacher Edelmira Kitchen, said she was pulled over by ICE on her way to work in September. Officials demanded she get out of her car so they could question her. Kitchen, a U.S. citizen who immigrated from the Dominican Republic as a child, said she refused and they eventually let her go. 

“I felt violated of my rights,” Kitchen said.

Hernández-Figueroa said ICE's heightened presence during the federal intervention in the city, has taken a toll on employees' mental health. Some have gone to the hospital with panic attacks in the middle of the school day. 

When the city sent mental health consultants to the school earlier this year as part of a partnership with the Department of Behavioral Health, school leadership had them work with teachers rather than students, worried their anguish would spill over to the classroom.

“If the teachers aren't good,” Hernández-Figueroa said, “the kids won't be good either.”

It's not just adults who are feeling more anxious. At a Guidepost Montessori School in Portland, Oregon, teachers observed preschoolers change in the weeks after an ICE arrest near the school in July. After pulling over a father who was driving his child to the school, officials encountered him in the school parking lot and tried to arrest him. In the ensuing commotion, the school went into lockdown: Children were pulled off the playground, and teachers played loud music and had children sing along to drown out the yelling.

Amy Lomanto, who heads the school, said teachers noticed more outbursts among students, and more students retreating to what the school calls “the regulation station,” an area in the main office with fidget toys kids can use to calm themselves.

She said what unfolded at her school underscored that even wealthy communities, like the one the school serves, are not immune from exposure to these kinds of events.

“With the current situation, more and more of us are likely to experience this kind of trauma,” she said. “That level of fear now is permeating a lot more throughout our society.”

Today's live updates have ended. Read what you missed below and find more coverage at apnews.com.

President Donald Trump road-tested his claims that he's tackling Americans' affordability woes at a Tuesday rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania — a trip that comes as polling consistently shows that public trust in Trump's economic leadership has faltered.

Following dismal results for Republicans in last month's off-cycle elections, the White House has sought to convince voters that the economy will emerge stronger next year and that any anxieties over inflation have nothing to do with Trump.

Trump on Tuesday summed his message up succinctly: “They caused the high prices and we're bringing them down.”

The president has consistently blamed his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, for inflation even as his own aggressive implementation of policies has pushed up prices that had been settling down after spiking in 2022 to a four-decade high. 

The trip hints the dilemma faced by Trump. He wants to take credit for rewiring the U.S. economy with his large tariff hikes and extension of income tax cuts, but he also continues to blame Biden for the increase nationwide in inflation rates that occurred this year during his own presidency. Overall, inflation is tracking at 3% annually, up from 2.3% in April when Trump rolled out a sweeping set of import taxes.

Other news we're following:








After rattling off a list of wars he claims credit for ending, the president said he would use his sway to end renewed combat between Cambodia and Thailand.

The Southeast Asian neighbors recently resumed fighting following a border skirmish. It derails a ceasefire deal that was mediated by Malaysia under pressure from Trump, who threatened to withhold trade unless both sides reached a truce.

“Tomorrow I'll have to make a phone call,” Trump said. “Who else could say, ‘I'm going to make a phone call and stop a war of two very powerful countries, Thailand and Cambodia'?”

Earlier, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on both sides to live up to their peace agreement.

As Trump was speaking in Pennsylvania, the state's Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, was in Washington appearing alongside Utah GOP Gov. Spencer Cox at the National Cathedral for an event focused on political civility.

“Leaders have a responsibility to speak and act with moral clarity,” Shaprio said, recounting the political violence that has occurred in his state, including an attempted assassination against Trump and an arson attack at the governor's mansion.

Cox also called for more productive political discourse. He said the impetus for that must come from voters, rather than Washington.

“If we think that a president of the United States or a governor is going to change where we are right now, we are fooling ourselves,” he said. “I truly believe that the people of our country are the ones who are going to have to change this.”

The event was interrupted several times by protestors who were escorted from the Cathedral.

He spoke for just over 90 minutes.

Trump in his second term has largely eschewed the raucous rallies that defined his three presidential campaigns and his first term. But he seemed to enjoy himself Tuesday, reviving many of his applause lines as he went after his critics and boasted about his own record.

He ended the rally as he has so many before: lingering on stage as the Village People's “YMCA” played, pointing at people in the crowd and briefly wagging his arms in what has become a signature dance move of his.

The president gave a shout-out to his head speechwriter more than an hour into a speech that was mostly ad-libbed.

“I haven't read practically anything off this stupid teleprompter,” Trump said. “And then my speechwriters keep getting awards for some of the finest speeches, and I haven't even read them.”

It was one of many quips from an ebullient Trump who seemed to have fun working his audience.

“The no tax on tips is incredible. No tax on overtime is incredible for my husband,” said Megan Hemhauser, whom Trump invited on stage to briefly speak. “And it all comes back to our family. It saves us and it's for the future of our children.”

Another woman, waitress Donna Zajack, said her newly tax-free tips will help with her daughter's tuition.

Trump pointed to one man, saying he plans to buy a house with the money he'll save from tax-free overtime. The man was not invited on stage.

Trump is rolling out new charts as he makes the case that the economy is thriving despite Americans' concerns about the cost of living.

“Biden Price Increases & Trump Price Decreases,” one chart's title reads.

The charts were displayed on large screens during his speech in Pennsylvania.

The president lashed out at “the stupid people” who criticized his travels abroad including a May trip to the Middle East.

Trump went on a tangent about the issue as he recalled a conversation with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The issue has been a source of tension with some Republicans, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Trump defended his trips, saying they generated billions in foreign investment for the U.S.

“Somebody complained that I was making a foreign trip,” Trump said at his rally in Pennsylvania. “They say, ‘He shouldn't be leaving the country.' Yeah, let's sit around and twiddle our thumbs.”

Trump says a West Virginia National Guardsman who was shot last month while patrolling in Washington, D.C., is recovering.

“Today I got a call that he got up from bed. Do you believe that? He got up. He got up,” Trump said of 24-year-old U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe.

“Now, he didn't speak,” Trump added. “He's not ready for that yet. I mean, he got hit in the head.”

Trump said U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, who was killed in the shooting, is “looking at us from heaven, from above.”

Eileen Higgins defeated Republican Emilio Gonzalez, who was endorsed by Trump.

Higgins spoke frequently in the Hispanic-majority city about Trump's immigration crackdown, saying she has heard of many people in Miami who were worried about family members being detained.

The local race drew attention from the both Democratic and Republican parties and leaders.

Higgins' victory provides Democrats another boost ahead of a midterm election when the GOP is looking to maintain its influence in Florida, including in a Hispanic-majority district in Miami-Dade County.

The area has shifted increasingly rightward politically in recent years, and the city may become the home of Trump's presidential library.

Trump is determined to blame Biden and Democrats for consumer prices that have risen during the year he returned to the White House.

He summed his message up succinctly: “They caused the high prices and we're bringing them down.”

“If I had one message tonight ...” he added, before breaking off on a two-minute tangent recognizing members of his White House staff. “But that's our message,” he said, returning to his point. “They gave you high prices. They gave you the highest inflation in history. And we're giving you — We're bringing those prices down rapidly.”

The president has consistently blamed Biden for inflation even as his own aggressive implementation of policies has pushed up prices that had been settling down after spiking in 2022 to a four-decade high.

Trump says his White House chief of staff Susie Wiles told him he needs to start campaigning to help Republicans in the midterm elections.

“She said, ‘We have to start campaigning, sir.' I said, ‘I won,'” Trump told the crowd at his rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania.

But Trump says Wiles said the president was needed to help Republicans in next year's elections, which will decide control of the House and Senate. Voters generally favor the party out of power in the White House during the midterm elections.

Wiles told the online conservative talk show “The Mom View” that Trump's return to the campaign trail would help to turn out voters who would otherwise sit out the election.

He's mixing ad-libbed commentary with his written remarks boasting about the economy and going after his enemies. 

He has taken several digs at the “fake news” and his predecessor, “sleepy Joe Biden,” drawing cheers and laughter from his enthusiastic audience.

Trump is taking the stage in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania. 

He walked out to Lee Greenfield's “God Bless the USA,” the song that has traditionally marked the start of his campaign rallies. He was met with chants of “USA, USA!”

U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco had initially halted the data sharing in August, but the order covering 22 states that had sued the administration over privacy concerns was set to expire Tuesday.

Chhabria said in a court hearing it will now remain in effect until Jan. 5, a timeframe the judge said will give attorneys for the federal government and the states time to file further briefs. The judge said he wanted attorneys to lay out their reasoning as to whether he had the authority to, for example, allow the policy to be used narrowly only pertaining to non-citizens enrolled in Medicaid but not more broadly, saying that thus far, “the scope of the policy, who it applies to, has not been adequately explained.”

Chhabria said he didn't anticipate there being another hearing before he issued a ruling, noting that the new timeframe and briefing schedule would also give both sides time to petition an appellate court before the Jan. 5 expiration date.

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries is asking for Hegseth to brief all members on the strikes near Venezuela.

“We need an all-member briefing for the House of Representatives,” Jeffries told The Associated Press.

“They haven't committed to it,” he said of Hegseth. “But we're going to continue to press our case.”

The move Tuesday appears to be the closest American warplanes have come to the South American country's airspace since the start of the Trump administration's pressure campaign in the region.

Public flight tracking websites showed a pair of U.S. Navy F/A-18 fighter jets fly over the body of water bounded by Venezuela for more than 30 minutes.

A U.S. defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military operations, confirmed that the jets conducted a “routine training flight” and said they stayed in international airspace. The official likened it to previous exercises aimed at showing the reach of U.S. planes.

The move is the latest action that the U.S. military has taken as it has built up warships in the region and launched deadly strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats. Those attacks are drawing new scrutiny from lawmakers.

The president also said Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett will be a “gift to Republicans” as she launches a new Senate campaign in Texas.

Trump made the comments aboard Air Force One a day after Crockett launched her campaign, telling Trump, “I'm coming for you.” Crockett is running for the seat held by Republican Sen. John Cornyn in what could be a critical race for both parties.

Crockett is a favorite GOP target and an outspoken Trump adversary.

The president didn't hold back when asked about the race: “I can't imagine she wins. Maybe she'll get the Democrat nomination, but I think it's a gift to Republicans, she's a terrible representative.”

Trump is making his way to a Pennsylvania resort where he's scheduled to road-test his claims that he's tackling Americans' affordability woes.

The president was late leaving Washington, where he had been attending a Christmas party at the vice presidential residence.

Trump's event in the Pocono Mountains will be held indoors in a conference center ballroom at the Mount Airy Casino Resort, a smaller venue than the arena rallies that could host thousands during his campaign.

More photos and videos show the Ballroom construction underway at the White House, on the site where the East Wing once stood.



The U.S. Justice Department has withdrawn from an agreement with the city of Houston to curb illegal dumping in Black and Latino neighborhoods.

The action is part of the Trump administration's broad elimination of jobs and programs dedicated to environmental justice.

Without federal monitoring, advocates in Houston say city officials have become less responsive to residents afflicted by persistent dumping in the historically Black neighborhood of Trinity/Houston Gardens.

The Justice Department and Houston officials did not respond to requests for comment.

Federal authorities also quietly ended a similar agreement over wastewater problems in rural Alabama, according to three former law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the move wasn't made public.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he spoke with Ukraine's Prime Minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, Tuesday morning about President Trump's “commitment to securing a lasting peace in Ukraine,” in a post on X.

Bessent said in the post that the pair discussed Treasury's October sanctions on Russia's oil giants, Lukoil and Rosneft, which are aimed at moving Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table and bringing an end to Moscow's brutal war on Ukraine.

They also discussed “the importance of driving Ukraine's reform and anti-corruption agenda forward.”

Gavin Newsom is writing a memoir he says will be “a truly vulnerable book” about his family, his struggles growing up with dyslexia and his political career.

It's the latest effort by Newsom, the California governor and a potential 2028 presidential candidate, to build more nuance into his public persona. He has long pushed back against a narrative that's dogged him since the start of his political career — that he had a privileged upbringing and rode the coattails of his father's wealthy and connected friends to political success.

He acknowledged the perception among many voters that he's a slick politician.

“A lot of people look at me in the stark white shirt, the blue suit and yeah, the gelled hair, and they think, ‘Oh I know this guy. I know him better than I'd ever want to know him.' I get it,” Newsom says in a video announcing the book. 

“This is a story of a kid who always felt like he wasn't quite enough.”Newsom's book, “Young Man in a Hurry,” will be released in February.

International alarm over a surge in fighting between Rwanda and Congo is growing less than a week after the two countries signed a peace deal in Washington that Trump has hailed as one of several agreements that are evidence of his peace-making prowess.

In a joint statement released on Tuesday, members of the International Contact Group for the Great Lakes expressed “profound concern” over recent developments in Congo's South Kivu region where new deadly violence blamed on the Rwandan-backed M23 militia group has exploded in recent days.

The group, which includes Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United States and the European Union, urged all sides “to uphold their commitments under the Washington Accords of 4 December 2025 and immediately deescalate the situation.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has placed calls to his Egyptian and Saudi counterparts to discuss the urgent need for progress in faltering peace efforts in Sudan, along with other regional matters including the Israel-Hamas conflict and the situation in Yemen.

The State Department said Rubio spoke Tuesday with Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan to discuss the issues.

The department said Rubio and Abdelatty discussed the implementation of the President Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza as well as “ongoing engagements to achieve a humanitarian ceasefire in Sudan.”

There was no mention of the Gaza plan in the readout of Rubio's call with the prince, but there was a reference to the outcomes of Trump's recent meeting in Washington with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman at which Gaza was a main topic as well as “developments in Yemen and the urgent need to advance peace efforts in Sudan.”

Fighting between the Sudanese military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has surged despite attempts to broker an end to the fighting, which began in 2023 and has killed more than 40,000 people, according to the World Health Organization, and displaced 12 million others. Aid groups warn that the true death toll is likely far higher.

The seven-term congressman says he'll instead run for local office in Fort Worth, seeking to become Tarrant County judge, the county's top elected official.

“Let me be clear: I'm not stepping back from the fight. I'm stepping into a new one,” he said in a statement.

The U.S. Supreme Court this month allowed the challenged Texas congressional redistricting plan to be used in next year's election, despite a lower-court ruling that the map likely discriminates on the basis of race.

The Texas congressional map enacted last summer at President Donald Trump's urging was engineered to give Republicans five additional House seats.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio says the U.S. is concerned by an uptick in fighting between Cambodia and Thailand along their contested border less than two months after the two countries signed a peace in Malaysia pushed for by President Trump.

“We strongly urge the immediate cessation of hostilities, the protection of civilians, and for both sides to return to the de-escalatory measures outlined in the October 26 Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords signed by the Prime Ministers of Cambodia and Thailand and witnessed by President Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim,” Rubio said in a statement.

The Cambodia-Thailand deal — one of several Trump has hailed as evidence of his negotiating abilities — has been faltering for weeks but took a big hit when fighting broke out following a weekend skirmish in which two Thai soldiers were injured. Five days of fighting since has left dozens dead on both sides and forced the evacuation of over 100,000 civilians.

Opponents of Missouri's new congressional map submitted thousands of petition signatures Tuesday calling for a statewide referendum on a redistricting plan backed by President Trump as part of his quest to hold on to a slim Republican majority in next year's elections.

Organizers of the petition drive said they turned in more than 300,000 signatures to the secretary of state's office — well more than the roughly 110,000 needed to suspend the new U.S. House districts from taking effect until a public vote can be held next year.

The signatures must still be formally verified by local election authorities and Republican Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, who's argued the referendum is unconstitutional. But if the signatures hold up, the referendum could create a significant obstacle for Republicans who hope the new districts could help them win a currently Democratic-held seat in the Kansas City area in the November election.

It's a resistance to U.S. pressure for painful concessions to Russia as he moved ahead Tuesday to rally more European support for his country.

“Undoubtedly, Russia insists for us to give up territories. We, clearly, don't want to give up anything. That's what we are fighting for,” Zelenskyy told reporters in a WhatsApp chat late Monday.

“Do we consider ceding any territories? According to the law we don't have such right,” he said. “According to Ukraine's law, our constitution, international law, and to be frank, we don't have a moral right either.”

In an interview with Politico released Tuesday, President Trump again pressed Zelenskyy to accept the U.S. proposal that Ukraine cede territory to Russia, arguing that Moscow retains the “upper hand” in its nearly 4-year-old invasion, and that Zelenskyy's government must “play ball.”

The Labor Department reported Tuesday that employers posted 7.67 million vacancies in October, close to September's 7.66 million.

The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), which was delayed by the extended government shutdown, also showed the layoffs rose and number of people quitting their jobs — a sign of confidence in the labor market — fell in October.

Job openings have come down steadily since peaking at a record 12.1 million in March 2022, when the economy was roaring back from COVID-19 lockdowns. The job market has cooled partly because of the lingering effect of the high interest rates the Federal engineered in 2022 and 2023 to combat an outburst of inflation.

Overall, it's a puzzling time for the American economy, buffeted by President Trump's decision to reverse decades of U.S. policy in favor of free trade and instead impose double-digit tariffs on imports from most of the world's countries.

And it planned to redact records to ensure protection of survivors' identities and prevent the dissemination of sexualized images.

Except to note that her plans to file a habeas petition could be spoiled because the public release of materials “would create undue prejudice so severe that it would foreclose the possibility of a fair retrial” if the habeas request succeeded.

Lawyers for the Epstein estate took no position.

Former Democratic Congressman Tom Perriello said Tuesday he would challenge Republican U.S. Rep. John McGuire in the midterm elections next year.

“Families can't afford groceries because Republicans in Congress like John McGuire won't stand up to Trump's tariffs,” Perriello said in a video launching his campaign.

Perriello, elected for one term in 2008, was the last Democrat to win Virginia's 5th Congressional district, which McGuire now represents. It's a district where President Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris by 12 points, according to the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project. McGuire was first elected to the district in 2024 after defeating former Republican U.S. Rep. Bob Good in a bitter primary.

Virginia Democrats who control the statehouse have indicated McGuire's seat may be vulnerable if they're successful in their efforts to redraw the state's Congressional maps ahead of elections next November. The General Assembly in October endorsed a proposed constitutional amendment allowing mid-decade redistricting, though another legislative vote is needed to refer the amendment to a statewide ballot.

A federal judge said Tuesday the Justice Department can publicly release investigative materials from a sex trafficking case against Ghislaine Maxwell, the longtime confidant of Jeffrey Epstein.

Judge Paul A. Engelmayer ruled after the Justice Department in November asked two judges in New York to unseal grand jury transcripts and exhibits from Maxwell and Epstein's cases, along with investigative materials that could amount to hundreds or thousands of previously unreleased documents.

The ruling, in the wake of the passage last month of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, means the records could be made public within 10 days. The law requires the Justice Department provide Epstein-related records to the public in a searchable format by Dec. 19.

President Trump dismissed Pope Leo XIV's criticisms of his aggressive immigration agenda, saying he's not seen the pontiff's remarks.

Leo recently offered strong support for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops criticizing the “vilification” of migrants and raids that have sown fear in immigrant communities.

Leo said the U.S. should use its justice system to handle immigration violations, “treating people humanely, treating people with the dignity that they have.”

In a Politico interview, Trump responded: “You know, they didn't like the wall. The wall turned out to be great.”

Pope Francis, Leo's predecessor, criticized Trump's first-term immigration policies, including expanding the U.S-Mexico border wall.

Trump told Politico he'd still be interested in meeting Leo, the first U.S.-born pontiff, and the president noted without prompting that he especially likes one of Leo's brothers who's a Trump supporter. “Do you know his brother is serious MAGA?” Trump said.

Questioned about how Republicans' delay on addressing Affordable Care Act subsidies might affect U.S. households' budget, Trump twice told a Politico reporter: “Don't be dramatic.”

It was the president's push back to a question about how ACA premium holders might be struggling around the holidays facing steep health insurance premium spikes if the GOP-run Congress doesn't address expiring subsidies.

Trump loosely explained Republicans' pitch to steer money directly to policy holders rather than subsidize premiums with tax credits that can be paid directly to insurance companies or claimed on policy holders' tax returns.

“I'm giving them money. I want to give the money to the people to buy their own health care,” Trump said. “That's a good thing, not a bad thing.”

Ahead of a planned speech on the economy, Trump is giving the U.S. market a sterling grade despite continued inflation, wealth gaps, layoffs and consumer angst.

“A-plus,” he told Politico when asked how he'd rate the economy, before adding, “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.”

Told of concerns even from one of his supporters, Trump shifted blame to his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden.

“I inherited a mess. I inherited a total mess,” he said, seemingly brushing off the idea of “affordability” that has become a buzz word ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

“Everything is coming down,” he insisted.

The latest federal analysis, using data from September, found that overall prices rose 2.8% over the previous year, up slightly from 2.7% in August. Core prices also rose 2.8% from a year earlier, a small decline from the previous month's figure of 2.9%.

The president says he hopes the two eldest members of the Supreme Court, who were nominated by Republican presidents, don't leave the bench.

He was asked during a Politico interview whether he would want Justices Clarence Thomas, 77, and Sam Alito, 75, to retire so Trump could tap their younger successors.

Trump dismissed the idea.

“I hope they stay 'cause I think they're fantastic, OK?” Trump said in the interview published Tuesday morning. “Both of those men are fantastic.”

Trump will road-test his claims that he's tackling Americans' affordability woes at a Tuesday rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania — shifting an argument made in Oval Office appearances and social media posts to a campaign-style event.

The trip comes as polling consistently shows that public trust in Trump's economic leadership has faltered. Following dismal results for Republicans in last month's off-cycle elections, the White House has sought to convince voters that the economy will emerge stronger next year and that any anxieties over inflation have nothing to do with Trump.

The president's reception in the county hosting his Tuesday rally could give a signal of just how much voters trust his claims. Monroe County flipped to Trump in the 2024 election after having backed Biden in 2020, helping the Republican to win the swing state of Pennsylvania and return to the White House after a four-year hiatus.

The Federal Reserve faces an unusually contentious meeting this week that will test Chair Jerome Powell's ability to corral the necessary support from fellow policymakers for a third straight interest rate cut.

The Fed's 19-member rate-setting committee is sharply divided over whether to lower borrowing costs again. The divisions have been exacerbated by the convoluted nature of the economy: Inflation remains elevated, which would typically lead the Fed to keep its key rate unchanged, while hiring is weak and the unemployment rate has risen, which often leads to rate cuts.

Some economists expect three Fed officials could vote against the quarter-point cut that Powell is likely to support at the Dec. 9-10 meeting, which would be the most dissenting votes in six years. Just 12 of the 19 members vote on rate decisions. Several of the non-voting officials have also said they oppose another rate cut.

The Supreme Court is considering a Republican-led drive, backed by Trump's administration, to overturn a quarter-century-old decision and erase limits on how much political parties can spend in coordination with candidates for Congress and president.

A day after the justices indicated they would overturn a 90-year-old decision limiting the president's power to fire independent agency heads, the court is revisiting a 2001 decision that upheld a provision of federal election law that is more than 50 years old.

Democrats are calling on the court to uphold the law.

The limits stem from a desire to prevent large donors from skirting caps on individual contributions to a candidate by directing unlimited sums to the party, with the understanding that the money will be spent on behalf of the candidate.

The Federal Election Commission and the GOP argue that the court should cast a skeptical eye on the limits, in line with recent high court decisions. Led by Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative majority has upended a variety of congressionally enacted limits on raising and spending money to influence elections.

Trump said Monday that he would allow Nvidia to sell an advanced type of computer chip used in the development of artificial intelligence to “approved customers” in China.

There have been concerns about allowing advanced computer chips to be sold to China as it could help the country better compete against the U.S. in building out AI capabilities, but there has also been a desire to develop the AI ecosystem with American companies such as chipmaker Nvidia.

Nvidia said in a statement that it applauded Trump's decision, saying the choice would support domestic manufacturing and that by allowing the Commerce Department to vet commercial customers it would “strike a thoughtful balance” on economic and national security priorities.

But a group of Democratic senators objected to the chip sales.

STOWE, Vt. (AP) — A rescue team that covers Vermont's tallest mountain has seen a rise in calls from inexperienced skiers who end up getting lost and in dangerous locations after being influenced by videos on social media.

After seeing footage online of skiers chasing fresh powder tracks in the backcountry, people are increasingly skiing out of bounds, finding themselves lost in the woods and in need of rescue.

On Nov. 29, Stowe Mountain Rescue responded to a 911 call from a skier and snowboarder lost in the woods on Mount Mansfield. The two 19-year-olds had decided to drive up from New York to ski in the backcountry outside Stowe Mountain Resort after seeing videos of others doing so on social media, according to the rescue team.

“They referenced a TikTok video which had influenced them,” Stowe Mountain Rescue chief Jon Wehse said. “These people are unprepared, they're ill-equipped, they're not in the right shape and they have no spatial awareness of where they are on the mountain, so it causes a problem very quickly.”

Stowe Mountain Rescue now sees around eight missions to help groups of lost skiers per season, up from around three such calls only five years ago, and that doesn't include rescues by Mount Mansfield Ski Patrol in bounds at the resort.

With Vermont already seeing record snowfall this winter, many ski resorts opened early for the season, which has only exacerbated the problem, Wehse said.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




“We have intermediate skiers that have no business being in the backcountry,” he said. 




Though Stowe has seen a rapid increase in rescues, Wehse says these incidents aren't limited to the area.

“This is not a Stowe problem, this is a Vermont problem. It's a global problem,” he said.

Backcountry downhill and cross-country skiing is alluring — and sometimes perilous — in other parts of the U.S. as well, including the Rocky Mountains. Skiers in the western U.S. also venture out of bounds from resorts — or park along mountain highways in pursuit of fresh powder in national forests and other public lands. 

For backcountry skiers, hazards include getting lost, navigating weather changes and even encountering avalanches. Avalanches are an especially grave risk when snow piles up on unstable, older snowfall, prompting forecasters to rate the risk throughout the winter. Ski patrollers at resorts routinely set off explosives and take other measures to trigger avalanches when no one is nearby to get hurt. But such measures aren't typically taken in more remote places out West, where the rule is to know the area's conditions and ski at your own risk.

Already this season, avalanche danger was rated high in mountainous areas of Idaho, Washington, Montana and Wyoming, according to the Bridger-Teton Avalanche Center based in Jackson Hole.

Another issue, according to Wehse, is that skiers are getting off lifts and blindly following tracks left behind by other skiers that may take them out of the ski boundary and into areas where they can no longer navigate back to the resort. 

In a social media post, Stowe Mountain Rescue urged inexperienced skiers to simply stay on the trails. 

“Keep in mind that those tracks you see in front of you might just be from Stowe Mountain Rescue's last subject,” the crew cautioned.

A lifelong skier, Wehse understands the pull to find fresh snow, but says there are ways to ski other areas on the mountain more safely. 

“I love social media, I love watching the videos myself. However, what I would urge everyone to do is to learn how to do this carefully. The best place to start is in bounds.”

Looking for ways to address the response to social media videos of “whooping skiers in knee-deep powder,” Stowe Mountain Rescue is considering the source. The crew plans to create social media posts teaching skiers and riders how to enjoy the backcountry responsibly.

Fox News national correspondent Garrett Tenney reports on a new app that tracks I.C.E. agents amid clashes in Los Angeles on ‘Special Report.' 

A federal judge on Wednesday blocked President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles and ordered them returned to the control of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. 

The order, handed down by U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer, is a blow to the Trump administration, and comes six months after the president in June deployed thousands of federalized National Guard troops to the city in response to a wave of immigration protests.

Breyer on Wednesday rejected the Trump administration's claim that the demonstrations in Los Angeles amount to a ""rebellion"" sufficient to justify the president's continued deployment of National Guard troops in the city under U.S.C. Section 12406, which allows a sitting president to call up or federalize National Guard troops during instances of a foreign invasion or in instances when the president is ""unable to execute the law.""

Breyer said in the 35-page order that the deployment runs ""contrary to law"" and risks ""creating a national police force made up of state troops."" 

""The founders designed our government to be a system of checks and balance,"" Breyer said Wednesday. ""Defendants, however, make clear that the only check they want is a blank one.""

White House officials told Fox News Digital on Wednesday that they looked forward to ""ultimate victory"" on the issue, suggesting they are likely to appeal the order to a higher court for review.

""President Trump exercised his lawful authority to deploy National Guard troops to support federal officers and assets following violent riots that local leaders like 'Newscum' refused to stop,"" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Fox News Digital in response to the ruling. ""We look forward to ultimate victory on the issue.""

Breyer, the brother of retired Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, had issued a temporary restraining order in June blocking Trump's National Guard deployment from immediately taking effect in California. 

That order was quickly stayed by the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, and Trump ultimately deployed roughly 5,000 troops in Los Angeles over the summer, as the protests continued, including 4,000 California National Guard troops and roughly 700 U.S. Marines.

""Six months after they first federalized the California National Guard, Defendants still retain control of approximately 300 Guardsmen, despite no evidence that execution of federal law is impeded in any way—let alone significantly,"" Breyer said Wednesday.

In anticipation of another appeal, Breyer stayed the new preliminary injunction from taking force through Dec. 15.

The new order comes as Trump's National Guard deployment has sparked fierce backlash from officials from California and other Democratic-led states where Trump launched similar federalization efforts this year, including Oregon and Illinois. 

Newsom, who immediately sued to block the effort in his state, has continued to assail the effort as both unprecedented and illegal.

Senior Trump administration officials have argued that the deployment is a necessary step to crack down on what they say is an uptick in violent crime and protect against threats from protesters, including anti-ICE demonstrations in many downtown areas, including Los Angeles.

Alain Hamel, the father of deceased UCSB student Liz Hamel, discusses the investigation into how his daughter fell from her college dorm on ‘America Reports.'

Nearly 10 months after UC Santa Barbara freshman Elizabeth ""Liz"" Hamel suffered a fatal fall from a campus residence hall balcony, police say the case is closed as an accident. But her family says the explanation doesn't add up and the Santa Barbara County District Attorney's Office now confirms the case is still ""under review.""

The UC Santa Barbara Police Department (UCPD) told Fox News Digital in a new statement that after conducting a months-long investigation, the department concluded Hamel died as the result of an accidental fall.

""Following a thorough investigation into the tragic passing of one of our students outside a residence hall in February 2025, UCPD forwarded its findings to the Santa Barbara County District Attorney's Office for review,"" the department said.

UCPD said it worked closely with the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office and the Santa Barbara County District Attorney's Office during the case.

TEXAS A&M STUDENT BRIANNA AGUILERA HAD DELETED SUICIDE NOTE ON PHONE, POLICE SAY

Liz Hamel, 18, was found unconscious outside a dorm on the campus of the University of California Santa Barbara Feb. 14 after apparently falling from a breezeway.  (Alain Hamel)

""Based on the totality of the exhaustive investigation, which entailed a systematic review and account of all available information and numerous interviews, including a person of interest identified during the course of the investigation, it is the Department's conclusion that the incident was an accidental fall,"" the statement continued.

The department said it met regularly with Hamel's immediate family and extended condolences.

""Our hearts and thoughts are with the family and friends who have suffered a terrible loss. Out of respect for the privacy of the family, we do not have any additional information to share.""

The Santa Barbara County District Attorney's Office separately told Fox News Digital the case remains ""under review."" The office did not provide a timeline for when there might be an update on the status of the case.

Hamel, an 18-year-old biology and chemistry student from Bellevue, Washington, was discovered around 10:26 p.m. on Feb. 14, 2025, beneath a third-floor walkway at UC Santa Barbara's San Rafael Residence Hall. She died six days later at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital.

The Hamel family, through their attorney, provided a statement to Fox News Digital expressing disagreement with the police conclusion and concern over unanswered questions.

""We are aware of UCSB Police's conclusion, but we still have unanswered questions about how Liz died. We will continue working with our counsel and the appropriate authorities to ensure that all available evidence is carefully reviewed.""

""On the human side, my wife and I are devastated. Liz was our only child and we are still trying to understand how to go on without her.""

Family attorney Tyrone Maho and private investigator Michael Claytor told Fox News Digital they disagree with the police department's conclusion and believe the evidence does not support closing the case. 

They said there is still critical information missing and flagged what they view as inconsistencies in the investigative record that ""remain unaddressed.""

They also raised concerns about UCPD handling the investigation, saying there may be a ""potential conflict of interest"" in having the university police department investigate the death of one of its own students.

""Our own investigation continues,"" they added.

According to SFGATE, Hamel's father and Maho held a news conference in June at the spot where she was found, pleading for information, particularly about the unidentified man who was last seen with her the night she died.

At the news conference, Maho told reporters that Hamel had spent nearly two hours at Lao Wang Noodle Bar in Isla Vista with the man, whom she appeared to be ""very close with"" inside the restaurant. She apparently left her phone and identification behind, which friends later recovered.

SFGATE reported that the pair did not walk toward San Miguel, Hamel's freshman dorm, but instead headed toward San Rafael, another residence hall on campus. ""She lived on the other side of campus,"" Alain Hamel said, noting that the dorm where his daughter was discovered is not on the route from the restaurant to her own residence hall.

""One doesn't just stumble across this dorm. It's not the first place one would go,"" Maho said, adding that they believe the man may have known someone there or may have been staying in the building.

At 10:26 p.m., a passerby, not the man who left the restaurant with her, found Hamel critically injured beneath a third-floor walkway outside San Rafael Residence Hall. She was still alive when first responders arrived and died six days later in the hospital.

Hamel moved to California in 2024 to pursue studies in biology and chemistry and hoped to become a scientist. She was also a member of Pi Beta Phi's California Zeta chapter, which publicly mourned her death in March.

""With heavy hearts, we share the passing of our beloved California Zeta sister Liz Hamel,"" the chapter wrote. ""Sending Pi Phi Love and support to her family, loved ones, and our sisters at Pi Beta Phi UCSB during this time.""

""Liz Hamel was a loved and cherished member of Pi Beta Phi. She will be remembered for the kindness and joy she brought to others.""

Her father expressed the family's grief in his earlier interview with Fox News.

""She was our world. She's our only child. And she was everything to us. … We were so lucky to have 18 years with her. We wish we had more time.""

As prosecutors continue their review and the family presses for answers, the events leading to Hamel's fatal fall remain unclear.

Pilots alert controllers that former Alaska Airlines pilot Joseph Emerson was out of the cockpit and subdued as the plane diverted for police. (LiveATC.net; Dave Killen/The Oregonian via AP)

A former Alaska Airlines pilot who tried to shut down the engines of a packed 2023 flight after taking psychedelic mushrooms forced crews into tense moments captured on dramatic cockpit audio.

Joseph Emerson, a pilot at the time, was off-duty on the Oct. 22, 2023, Horizon Air flight from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco when the flight crew subdued him.

He was riding in an extra seat in the cockpit aboard Flight 2059, which was carrying 84 people, when audio obtained by KGW Portland captured the moment he reached for the engine controls.

""I'm not OK,"" Emerson could be heard saying repeatedly.

One of the crew members, who sounded confused, asked Emerson, ""What's wrong? You want to be home?""

What sounds like a struggle can then be heard in the cockpit. One of the pilots then alerted air traffic controllers to the emergency.

""We need to make an emergency landing,"" the pilot said. ""We got a jump seater who just tried to shut our engines off. We need to go direct to Portland now.""

The pilot was referring to Emerson, and a short time later, the pilot reached back out to air traffic controllers with an update.

""We've got the guy that tried to shut the engines down out of the cockpit, and he doesn't sound like he's causing any issues in the back right now,"" the pilot said. ""I think he's subdued. Other than that, yeah, we want law enforcement as soon as we get on the ground and park.""

As the crew continued its descent into Portland, the air traffic controller asked what the threat level was.

The pilot told the controller that the threat was in the back of the plane, adding that the threat level was reduced. He said he planned to check in with the flight attendant to make sure everything was still ""running smoothly.""

The controller then asked how high the threat level had reached during the incident.

""It escalated to a four,"" the pilot said, adding that ""he's out of the cockpit now.""

The pilot added that Emerson was handcuffed in a jump seat toward the back of the plane, giving a heads-up for when law enforcement arrived onboard.

""Right now, he's staying calm,"" the pilot said.

The plane was eventually diverted to Portland, where it landed safely.

At the time, Emerson, a California resident, told authorities he was grieving a friend's death and had taken psychedelic mushrooms about two days earlier. He also said he had gone more than 40 hours without sleep.

Believing he was dreaming, he said he pulled the two red handles that would have activated the plane's fire suppression system and cut off fuel to its engines.

Emerson was federally charged with interfering with a flight crew. In Oregon, he was charged with 83 counts of endangering another person and one count of endangering an aircraft.In September, he pleaded guilty to charges against him as part of a deal with state and federal prosecutors. Federal prosecutors originally asked a judge to impose a one-year prison sentence.

""Pilots are not perfect. They are human,"" the judge said. ""They are people, and all people need help sometimes.""

Before hearing his sentence, Emerson spoke, saying he regretted his actions.

Emerson received a 50-day jail sentence with credit for time served and five years of probation. He was also sentenced to five years of probation, 664 hours of community service – eight hours for each person he endangered – and ordered to pay more than $60,000 in restitution, nearly all of it to Alaska Air Group.

Joel Klatt and Colin Cowherd discuss Notre Dame withdrawing from bowl eligibility after missing the CFP, the final bracket and whether Fernando Mendoza should go pro or stay in college another season. 

For the past couple of decades, former NFL star quarterback and Pro Football Hall of Famer Troy Aikman has shared his thoughts on what he's seen during whichever game he and his longtime broadcast partner are calling.

The three-time Super Bowl winner is part of the ""Monday Night Football"" broadcast crew. Aikman has routinely given his take on a variety of football-related topics, from the state of NFL officiating to college football.

Some of Aikman's latest thoughts about the college game centered on the growing number of players who have taken advantage of the transfer portal in today's polarizing NIL landscape.

The former Dallas Cowboys quarterback and many others have referred to the state of today's sport at the collegiate level as the ""Wild West.""

""College football has become the Wild West, as everybody knows. Forget about Lane Kiffin for a minute, but starting with NIL, there just has been no guardrails. I'm on the National Football Foundation Board, so I hear firsthand from a lot of the commissioners and athletic directors and the people involved in all of that. It's gotta get cleaned up, first and foremost,"" Aikman told The Athletic.

When asked about student-athletes' mobility in today's world, Aikman reflected on his personal choices during his time competing at the NCAA level.

NFL GREAT TROY AIKMAN FIRES BACK AT JERRY JONES' TRADE PLAN AMID LOSING EFFORT: 'HE MAY WANT TO CANCEL'

""I was a transfer. I went from Oklahoma to UCLA, and I've always felt that if a coach is able to pick up and leave, that a player should have the same opportunity if a coach leaves,"" he continued.

""What's happened obviously over the years since I got out of college football is that, in recent years with NIL, there's been no accountability on the players,"" Aikman continued. ""So, the players pick up, and now they're leaving all the time whereas before it was typically the coach. The player used to have to sit out a year. Now, the players can up and go regardless of whether or not they've been paid. It's every man for himself.""

Aikman then dived into another college football hot topic — Lane Kiffin's decision to leave Ole Miss in favor of LSU. The NFL analyst gave his best guess on what fueled Kiffin to make the leap.

""Lane Kiffin's motivation? Is it his thoughts that it's a better opportunity for him at LSU? Possibly. Is it money? Possibly. Is it lifestyle? Possibly. I can't answer any of those questions.

""But whatever his motivation is, he feels like LSU is the right place for him. So, I don't fault him for that at all. I know there's always hard feelings. Ole Miss did not want to lose Lane Kiffin,"" he said. ""Once he made the decision to leave, now he's a pariah. Let's get this guy just as far away from us as we can. I understand that as well. Everybody gets a little bit jaded.""

Aikman concluded that those in positions of power should ultimately take charge and focus on getting things in order. 

""Where I'm at is I think there's gotta be some leadership at the very top that kind of cleans all of this up. Starting with players that accept money, there's gotta be some accountability and responsibility on their behalf to have to stick with a program,"" Aikman said.

""I gave money to a kid. I won't mention who. I've done it one time at UCLA. Never met the young man. He was there a year. He left after the year. I wrote a sizable check, and he went to another school. I didn't even get so much as a thank-you note.""

Aikman is scheduled to be on the call for a Week 15 matchup between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Miami Dolphins Dec. 15.

The suspect accused of shooting two Kentucky State University students, killing one, on campus Tuesday has been identified as an Indiana man who was not enrolled at the school.

Frankfort police said 48-year-old Jacob Lee Bard, of Evansville, Indiana, was booked on murder and first-degree assault charges in connection with the campus shooting. Evansville is about 150 miles west of Frankfort. 

Authorities said Bard is not a student at the university, and police have not provided information as to a suspected motive.

Frankfort officers responded around 3:10 p.m. to a report of a shooting at the Whitney M. Young Jr. residence hall and arrived within minutes. By the time they reached campus, Kentucky State University police had already taken the suspect into custody.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","​​Democrats set expanded targets after surprise victories in Florida and Georgia","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/state/3912970/democrats-set-expanded-targets-surprise-victories-florida-georgia/","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 13:33:23 GMT","

A string of election victories on Tuesday has Democrats bullish about the midterm elections, leading them to expand their target map for 2026.

In an upset win, the party flipped the Miami mayorship blue, fueling Democratic confidence, while Eric Gisler's sweeping victory in a Georgia state House race stole another seat from Republicans, offering further cause for celebration.

The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee responded to the positive results by announcing plans to expand its 2026 target map to include “new flip” opportunities across the country, including in both chambers of the Arizona and New Hampshire state legislatures. The DLCC, which serves as the campaign arm dedicated to electing Democrats to statehouses, also revealed it will seek to break and prevent Republican supermajorities in the Florida, Indiana, Missouri, and North Carolina legislatures.

“The DLCC's data shows that state legislative Democrats overperformed 2025 elections in targeted districts by 4.5 points on average, which, if replicated in 2026 elections, would provide the most significant Democratic gains at this ballot level in two decades,” the committee wrote.

The DLCC said the new map would target 42 chambers, “the most targets ever.” And it announced a $50 million investment in 2026 races, described as “the largest single-year budget to date.”

Special elections and off-year elections often favor Democrats due to lower turnout. 

While Democrats were enjoying the results on Tuesday night, President Donald Trump was touting the Republican message at a rally in Pennsylvania, a critical battleground state for both parties.

The president highlighted the administration's efforts to spur economic opportunity, as the White House continues to rip Democrats for seeking to dominate the affordability conversation.

“Democrats talking about affordability is like Bonnie and Clyde preaching out public safety,” Trump told the crowd, calling the party the “enemy of the working class” and reiterating statements in which he has blamed the Biden administration for overseeing a steep rise in inflation.

“Democrats say, ‘Prices are too high,'” he said. “Yeah, prices are too high because they caused them to be high.”

The president's appearance came as his senior advisers, including chief of staff Susie Wiles, have pushed him to campaign for Republicans ahead of the midterm elections. Their strategy follows the GOP's rough year politically, with losses in Virginia and New Jersey preceding the results in Georgia and Florida on Tuesday evening.

Republicans “‘have to win the midterms, and you're the guy that's going to take us over the midterms,'” Trump recalled his advisers telling him during the rally.

But galvanized by their string of victories this year, Democrats hold an increasingly optimistic outlook ahead of the highly anticipated 2026 elections.

VANCE WARNS GOP NEEDS TO GIVE VOTERS SOMETHING TO ‘BELIEVE IN' WITHOUT TRUMP ON BALLOT

“It's clear state legislative Democrats have undeniable momentum heading into the new year,” DLCC President Heather Williams said in a statement this week responding to Gisler's shock victory in Georgia.

“Eric Gisler just defied expectations and flipped a deep red Trump district in Georgia,” she added, in a warning to Republicans. “This victory builds on state Democrats' momentum as we've overperformed and flipped red, blue, and purple districts across the country all year round. From Iowa to Pennsylvania to Virginia to Mississippi to now Georgia, we are competing and winning all across the map.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump, with over three years left in his term, has refrained from passing the MAGA baton to any of his possible successors, keeping his looming lame-duck status at bay.

Despite signaling that Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio could be the heirs to his coalition, Trump this week evaded pointing to either man directly, simply saying he believes Republicans have a strong bench for 2028.

In a recent interview with Politico, Trump praised his Cabinet members but did not name a single person who could energize the coalition that propelled him to the White House for a second time.

“I don't know,” Trump said. “You never know until they're tested. You know, it's like, uh, you jump in the water, you can swim or you can't. Some people can swim, and some people can't. You never know. You have to see.”

“I think we have a very good bench,” he continued. “We have a great Cabinet. I have a really great Cabinet — better than my first Cabinet. I had some very good people in my first Cabinet, but this Cabinet, you know, I have much more experience.”

The president's comments were notable given his past predilection for sharing the spotlight with several members of his Cabinet and, at times, ceding press attention to them. Trump has pointed to Vance, and Rubio to a lesser extent, as “most likely” to become the MAGA successor. At the last Cabinet meeting of 2025, Trump praised Vance's dominant 2024 vice presidential debate performance against Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN).

VANCE WARNS GOP NEEDS TO GIVE VOTERS SOMETHING TO ‘BELIEVE IN' WITHOUT TRUMP ON BALLOT

“I think the man's a grossly incompetent man,” Trump said of Walz last week. “I thought that from the day I watched JD destroy him.”

However, as Trump enters an era in which the GOP is looking to 2028, dangling a full-throated endorsement is a surefire way to push back against allegations of a lame-duck era.

“Trump also wants to play kingmaker,” said Matt Dole, a Republican political consultant based in Ohio. “Trump wants to continue to have influence. And that's probably the most important or most interesting part of this entire process is Trump's going to be pretty active through the midterm, and then he's going to pretty quickly become a lame duck.”

Dole also said Trump's return to dodging the 2028 successor question is a wise decision.

“The president's probably right that the jury is out on who can capture the Trump coalition and keep it going, or if anybody can, I think the jury is probably still out on that,” he said.

In the aftermath of GOP losses in New Jersey and Virginia last month, Vance pushed the GOP to give Trump's working-class coalition a reason to show up without the president on the ballot.

“We've got to motivate them,” Vance told Breitbart last month. “We've got to get them out to vote. I think it's one of the lessons that we learned in Virginia and New Jersey is that when Donald Trump is not on the ballot, you've got to give people something to actually believe in, something to be inspired by, to get out there and vote. They're not going to vote just because you have an R next to your name — you've got to speak to this new working-class coalition.”

Vance has also faced some pushback over his reticence and call for unity after a GOP civil war broke out over Tucker Carlson‘s cozy sit-down with the controversial Nick Fuentes, who has made antisemitic comments, and Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts's defense of the interview.

I think it's idiotic to overreact to a couple of elections in blue states, but a few thoughts:1) Scot Pressler, TPUSA, and a bunch of others have been working hard to register voters. I said it in 2022, and I've said it repeatedly since: our coalition is ""lower propensity"" and…

However, Trump's hesitation to name Vance or Rubio likely has less to do with any GOP infighting and more to do with the president “making sure that everyone is beholden to him and not wanting to have someone in his court angling or those people that hold court … maneuvering behind his back or moving past him,” said Jason Roe, a GOP strategist who has worked on presidential campaigns.

The president may also recognize that, with 2028 set to be an open field, GOP lawmakers outside the White House are itching to launch their own presidential campaigns.

“Vance embodies more of the pugnaciousness of MAGA, but I think Marco is more serious,” said Roe, who worked on Rubio's past presidential campaign. “He's more of an adult about his role. And are we going to be pandering to the manosphere and want the bro-y pugnacious guy, or are we going to want the guy who's on a mission out there to do something, which I think Marco projects a little more? And then you got [Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL)], who I think can combine a little bit of both of their styles. But does he ever get out from under being the anti-Trump in 2024?”

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), a key ally of Trump on Capitol Hill, has also been rumored to be laying groundwork for a 2028 run, although he has denied the allegations.

TRUMP SETS UP VANCE, RUBIO, AND OTHERS FOR SUCCESS AND COMPETITION IN LEAD-UP TO 2028

“In the past six to nine months after the president has been reelected, there's a long list of those looking to speak at the Des Moines Reagan and Lincoln Day dinner,” said Brian Seitchik, a national GOP strategist. “Because of the unique qualities of this president and his continued stranglehold on the base that open campaigning for 2028 has not yet begun.”

“There's still a lot of runway between now and after the midterms, when that race really kicks off. While the president has shown an interest and a fondness for both Rubio and Vance, there's a lot of game left here for who's going to get that nomination and how this is all going to play out,” he added. “So I don't read too much into the president's comments” to Politico.

MOUNT POCONO, Pennsylvania — Hundreds, if not thousands, of people braved the cold on Tuesday to attend President Donald Trump‘s economy-focused speech in northeast Pennsylvania, the informal kickoff of the president's efforts to boost Republican candidates ahead of a contentious midterm election cycle.

Trump's remarks, delivered in a ballroom at a casino in Mount Pocono, came as he and GOP candidates are seeking to head off rising affordability concerns among voters. The matter consistently ranked No. 1 in voters' minds, both ahead of and after major Democratic wins in the November elections.

“Just over one year ago today, with your help, we saved America,” the president opened. “That's what happened. The most important election victory, possibly, in the history of our country. By the way, last election, did we kick ass? That means we won three times in a row.”

“Now, after just 10 months in office, I'm pleased to report that America is winning again,” he continued. “Pennsylvania is prospering again, and I will not rest until this commonwealth is wealthier and stronger than ever before. Since my inauguration, we've created nearly 60,000 new Pennsylvania jobs, including 4,000 Pennsylvania manufacturing jobs that the Democrats gave up on. You're doing better than you've ever done under leadership.”

Republican lawmakers have subtly pressed Trump since the November elections to do more to win back voters on the economy, but the president has spent the past month referring to affordability as a “con” or “hoax” orchestrated by Democrats. On Monday, while speaking at the White House, he refrained from using that language, but on Tuesday night, he was right back at it.

“They always have a hoax,” he declared. “The new word is affordability. Democrats talking about affordability is like Bonnie and Clyde preaching about public safety, and they are really the, truly, the enemy of the working class when they do it.”

Though Trump did not take the stage until more than an hour after his scheduled 6 p.m. start, rally attendees started lining up around 5 a.m. to enter the concourse. Roughly a third of the crowd, both seated in the audience and standing on risers behind the president's podium, were dressed in Trump's own image, wearing dark suits and red ties. The sea of Trump-branded red ball caps in the crowd was punctuated by more than a smattering of Santa hats.

The White House declined to give a head count for Tuesday's rally, but shortly before Trump arrived, an announcer asked guests standing in the aisles to move into overflow viewing rooms.

And in case anyone was unsure of the White House's message for the evening, massive “LOWER PRICES” and “BIGGER PAYCHECKS” signs hung behind the stage in blue.

Trump spoke after comments from a handful of Pennsylvania lawmakers, including Rep. Rob Bresnahan (R-PA), Sen. Dave McCormick (R-PA), and other political allies.

The bulk of Monroe County, where Mount Pocono is located, lies within Bresnahan's district. He pledged his support for the president's message while subtly acknowledging that elevated costs are hammering American households.

“The message is the same everywhere we go: lower the costs, support high-paying jobs, keep our community safe, and listen to the people doing the work,” Bresnahan said. “They aren't asking for partisan arguments. They're asking for results.”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a rising star within Trump‘s Cabinet, warmed up the crowd with a more direct approach: tearing into former President Joe Biden and pledging that inflation will “roll down” over the next year.

Just after taking the stage, Bessent joked that while nearby Scranton may be Biden's hometown, the state is “Trump country,” drawing cheers from the crowd.

Just like the neocons he criticizes, Trump embraces the wielding of American power to impose his own worldview on countries that do not share it. 

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Donald Trump hates the neocons. He'll tell you so himself.

In a speech in Saudi Arabia in May, Trump criticized past American presidents for being “afflicted with the notion that it's our job to look into the souls of foreign leaders and use U.S. policy to dispense justice for their sins,” mocking “so-called nation-builders, neocons, or liberal nonprofits” as useless. He has long ridiculed the Republican establishment for its management of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan—though more in the tone of a fan angry about his team losing than of a principled opponent of militarism.

This philosophy of nonintervention, however, has turned out to be the opposite of his actual policy.

Last week, Trump unveiled his National Security Strategy, which claims that European nations face “civilizational erasure” resulting from the politics of the European Union, and from “migration policies that are transforming the continent and creating strife, censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition, cratering birthrates, and loss of national identities and self-confidence.” To the extent the document articulates any strategy at all, it appears to be for the United States to pressure Europe to deregulate, crack down on migration, and buy more oil and gas.

Trump has interfered in foreign affairs in many ways. He has ordered the bombing of Iran and is preparing for an attack on Venezuela; “We're gonna hit 'em on land very soon,” he told Politico on Monday. In the Caribbean, his military has committed what law-of-war experts have called murder, launching missiles at boats suspected of carrying drugs. (The national-security justification for this is nonexistent; most illegal narcotics are brought into the U.S. through ports of entry by people who are crossing legally.) He has pressured other countries economically—for example, by imposing punitive tariffs on Brazil for prosecuting former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally who had attempted a coup. And he has expressed a desire for territorial expansionism through the annexation of Canada and Greenland. One thing is very clear: Trump is in no sense a “noninterventionist.”

From the January 2026 issue: The neocons were right

But more important, he is not so different from the neoconservatives he often criticizes. Like them, he embraces the wielding of American power to impose his own worldview on countries that do not share it. The attack on Europe for supposedly accepting “civilizational erasure” is nothing if not an attempt to “dispense justice” to European nations that have committed the sin of multiculturalism. This is a kind of neo-neoconservatism, premised on ethno-nationalism rather than the democracy promotion of the post-9/11 era.

As the neoconservative godfather Irving Kristol once wrote, “In foreign policy, neoconservatism believes that American democracy is not likely to survive for long in a world that is overwhelmingly hostile to American values.” It was therefore important to use military force and diplomacy to compel other nations to share those values. After 9/11, this became the operating principle of American foreign policy. The theory was that, by spreading democracy, America would be less likely to be attacked again. In October 2001, the then-neoconservative Max Boot wrote, “We must not only wipe out the vipers but also destroy their nest and do our best to prevent new nests from being built there again.” To be safe, America had to make the rest of the world more like America.

Like the neocons, Trump's neo-neocons repeatedly invoke the West's complacency and unwillingness to defend its own values, a frailty that can be rectified only through the ritual use of military force against weaker targets. The conservative writer Jonah Goldberg once articulated what he called the “Ledeen Doctrine,” after the neoconservative Michael Ledeen, which was: “Every ten years or so, the United States needs to pick up some small crappy little country and throw it against the wall, just to show the world we mean business.” Despite Trump's rejection of George W. Bush, MAGA bears many similarities to the right-wing politics of that era—a fetishization of violence and torture, the treatment of opposition as treasonous, a disdain for due process, and an anti-Muslim bigotry at odds with fundamental American principles.

Although the pretense of adhering to democratic values has been abandoned by an administration that disdains democracy, free speech, and the rule of law, the theory is nonetheless the same: Unless America defends ethno-nationalism against the forces of multiracial democracy elsewhere, ethno-nationalism will not be safe here. The Trump administration's rabid hostility toward the “Rainbow Nation” of South Africa, with its history all Americans can recognize, makes more sense in this context.

Franklin Foer: Why the Gulf monarchs shower Trump with gifts

Although the neoconservative project failed and the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan are justly remembered as disasters, some neocons did care deeply about the principles of democracy, in their own misguided way. They have proved it by opposing Trump, even at the cost of their former associations and status in the political party to which they have devoted their lives. But for others, the appeal of interventionism seems to have been more about a kind of ethnic chauvinism, about reiterating the superiority of the enlightened West over primitivist “Islamofascism.” For that faction of former neocons, well, Trumpism fit like a well-tailored suit.

Trump's National Security Strategy is, of course, not just about foreign policy. This administration has shown itself to be hostile to America's multiracial inheritance. It is engaged in a social-engineering project to make the United States less diverse through mass deportation; the attack on birthright citizenship; and selective enforcement of antidiscrimination laws, which will make it easier to exclude women and ethnic and racial minorities from elite professions. A National Security Strategy that describes any nation with more welcoming policies as engaged in its own self-destruction is a warning, too, for those Americans who do not fit within the Trump administration's racially defined view of citizenship. After all, if European civilization can be “erased” by the mere presence of those who do not share the ethnic background of the majority, then the same applies to white people in the United States.

The Trump administration's strategy document states that “who a country admits into its borders—in what numbers and from where—will inevitably define the future of that nation.” Trump has made clear that this is no anodyne statement—at a rally Tuesday he defended his “permanent pause” on “third-world migration” by expressing his dismay at the fact that instead of people coming from Norway, Sweden, or Denmark, immigrants were coming to the U.S. from “Somalia, places that are a disaster, filthy, dirty, disgusting.” Trump is not concerned about “migration”; in some general sense, he's concerned that the immigrants are not white.

This is the “Great Replacement” theory, applied globally. It is the same might-makes-right worldview of the worst neocons, but in service of the abhorrent principle of segregation instead of democracy, and suggesting a future of American imperialism unmoored from any pretense of a belief in the equality of mankind.

How the GOP is suffering from success.

It's been a rocky month for the GOP after losing big in last month's elections, and the party knows it. Members of Congress are heading for the exit; the vibe couldn't be further from Trump's exultant return to power in January.

To understand what's going on — and what it portends for the future of the right — I spoke with my colleague Andrew Prokop for Vox's daily newsletter, Today, Explained. Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below, and you can sign up for the newsletter here for more conversations like this.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

Why does it feel like the right is in disarray right now?

In 2024, there was a lot of talk about the vibes shifting in favor of the right. There was a sense that public opinion was moving in their direction, history was on their side, elites had accepted they were right on some major questions. Nearly a year into the second Trump administration, the vibes appear to have shifted again. Various factions of the right are increasingly discussing and debating this question of, What has gone wrong? How did they go from MAGA triumphant to this increasing suspicion that things aren't actually going well for them anymore?

How has that manifested?

The most interesting example is in the MAGA influencer sphere. Back in Trump's first term, the way to get maximum virality and engagement from a right-wing audience was loyalty: Just back Donald Trump in whatever he did. We are increasingly seeing that it doesn't quite work like that anymore in 2025.

There's not a full break from Trump, but we're seeing increasing criticism on certain issues where these social media influencers and media personalities are very attuned to what their audience is thinking. There is this increasing move toward debate and criticism about certain things in Trump's second term that might not be going very well. And there are signs in Congress of congressional Republicans being a bit less likely to go along with what Trump wants.

This can be exaggerated a little bit, but we have seen some instances of defiance, like the vote to release the Epstein Files. The debate in the larger right-wing ecosystem is about what their party should actually stand for.

What's responsible for Trump's loss of momentum?

Part of this is a familiar, normal story about the president winning and being term-limited. The recent election results in November put a scare into Republicans, and hammered home the message that, actually, the polls are correct. Trump is unpopular. The public doesn't like what he's doing. And the GOP is on track for a difficult midterms.

I also think that a lot of the vibe shift on the right is about ways in which the broader issue environment has changed, in part because Trump was so successful. For instance, in Trump's first term, his presidency was constantly under siege, beset by investigations and impeachment. That actually served as a unifying force on the right. But now those threats are gone. Trump won convincingly in 2024. He shut down the investigations into him and so he doesn't really have that to fall back on anymore.

“I also think that a lot of the vibe shift on the right is about ways in which the broader issue environment has changed, in part because Trump was so successful.”

The other big threat that has united the right, especially in recent years, was the hatred and fear of “wokeness.” The MAGA 2.0 coalition could disagree on a lot of things, but they all came together in the belief that they hated wokeness. And again, this is a case where Trump is a victim of his own success: There has been this vibe shift in which the right's monster of wokeness appears to have been slain and the culture appears to have moved on. The people who were once united against it are now no longer focused on it as a big threat anymore, and are freed up to focus on what they disagree on.

Is this a temporary thing, or the start of a longer spiral for Trump?

There's always a push and pull with this stuff. A lot of times in the second term, once reelection concerns are gone, presidents feel more free to try to please their base, to do things that maybe they would have shied away from early on. I do expect Trump to continue to try to push the limits of what's legal or acceptable.

We've seen signs that he's going to that: Stephen Miller thinks the immigration crackdown should be even harsher than it already is. If he remains empowered in the administration, we should expect it to get harsher. We should expect these constant attempts to implement policy from the executive branch.

The right-wing base hasn't broken with Trump — they're not against him. They're just a little burned out or disappointed that they haven't gotten everything they dreamed of. He might try to deliver them more wins to keep them engaged and to try to get them to turn out to vote in the midterms.

JD Vance is arguably Trump's heir apparent. What role does he play in all of this?

He has his wagon hitched to Trump, and that's a tough spot: a vice president trying to succeed a president who is increasingly being viewed as somewhat of a disappointment. He would have to make the case about what he would do differently; and, in theory, there are ways he can do that, but there's a lot of pressure not to break from the president in any way.

Having said that, loyalty and affection toward Trump among the larger Republican electorate is still quite strong, so it's a tremendous advantage for Vance if he does end up being Trump's anointed successor. It's going to be very hard to dislodge him unless there's some sort of even further break from Trump, akin to George W. Bush's popularity collapse in his second term. Unless that happens, Vance is still in a pretty good place.

Anything else you're keeping an eye on here?

I do think it's good to distinguish between Trump's increasing unpopularity among the general public — which is probably mainly because of the economy — and the increasing disillusionment and dissatisfaction among elements of the highly engaged right-wing Republican coalition, because I think they stem from different sources. The particular issues, and the way this plays out among the right-wing coalition, are very different from what we might be seeing in the general public's backlash against Trump.

Welcome to the ‘la, la, la, can't hear you' climate era.

Earlier this month, the real-estate listing site Zillow ended a subtle social experiment. In 2024, they began to embed climate risk data directly in their property profiles, scoring a home's future risks from flood, wildfire, wind, heat, and air quality on a 1-to-10 scale.

Say you are looking for a home in your budget for your growing family, and you find the perfect three-bedroom Cape Cod house — but it's close to a shoreline. Zillow's property listing might show that it has a nine out of 10 flood risk score. Depending on your personal risk tolerance, that might rule out the house for you.

Including this information seemed like an obvious move for Zillow. Disasters worsened by warming are contributing to multibillion-dollar damages to homes, and the site's competitors, such as Redfin, already feature climate risk information in their listings.

“Climate risks are now a critical factor in home-buying decisions,” Skylar Olsen, chief economist at Zillow, said in a statement last year.

Zillow's own data proved that many homebuyers were indeed starting to think more about climate change alongside square footage, nearby schools, and curb appeal — so much so that real estate agencies and sellers complained that the climate risk scores were starting to hurt sales.

Which is kind of the point.

Giving homebuyers a sense of where warming temperatures could lead to a higher chance of a wildfire or flood should ideally steer people away from properties facing greater danger. Over time, people would buy safer homes — and if they chose to buy in riskier areas, at least they were forewarned and could boost their insurance policies.

But climate risk assessments are not great if your current house has a bad score, and you're trying to sell it. Under pressure from real estate groups, Zillow stopped including them. The climate risks, of course, haven't gone away.

Welcome to the “la, la, la, can't hear you” climate era.

In many parts of the US, populations are still increasing in areas vulnerable to disasters such as floods, extreme heat, drought, and fires, while the federal government under President Donald Trump is removing references to climate change from government websites.

People, too, will cover their eyes when the climate reality threatens real estate prices. Clear Lake, Texas, for example, installed signs showing the potential high water mark from storm surge after Hurricane Ike in 2011, but when locals complained that the warnings were hurting sales, the signs were taken down. In 2012, North Carolina outlawed a forecast of sea level rise that showed that many more coastal properties were at risk of flooding over the next century, in favor of adopting a forecast that only looked 30 years ahead.

Yet, while sellers might want to overlook future risks, banks, insurance companies, and buyers don't want to lose money on what is often their single-most expensive purchase. More costly disaster damages are also taking a bigger bite out of the $55 trillion US residential housing market as a whole.

“I don't think this is a good thing for anyone but Zillow — people need to know more about their risk, not less,” said Marc Ragin, a researcher studying disaster risk at the University of Georgia, in an email.

Anticipating future threats worsened by climate change is not just about creating warnings, though; they can be useful tools for adapting to climate change. One community that took them seriously actually saved money by lowering their property insurance rates. Here's how.

Wildfires regularly confront the communities around Lake Tahoe in Nevada and California. Though the flames rarely make it into neighborhoods, the basin is often bathed in choking smoke from nearby blazes, and residents are starting to realize that it's only a matter of time before they will face an inferno up close.

The Tahoe Fund, a nonprofit, took an unflinching look at the wildfire risks in the area and launched a pilot project this year to create “the most fire-ready community in Tahoe.” They laid out their process in a playbook for reducing fire risks that they hope any place looking to reduce the odds of homes going up in flames could draw on.

They began with a homeowners association in pine-forested Incline Village, Nevada — home to 9,000 people — where the average home price is $1.4 million. The association, Tyrolian Village, is composed of 228 homes. Using a mix of fire risk models, the Tahoe Fund team identified the areas most primed to burn. The models they used were more sophisticated than those used on real estate sites and more tailored to the community, but it helped the team get more bang for their buck when it came to figuring out what tactics would best improve the neighborhood's fire resilience.

“Through technology, you don't necessarily need to do everything,” said Amy Berry, who leads the Tahoe Fund. “You need to do the things that are the most important that are going to have the biggest impact on lowering risk.”

They then reached out to community leaders to set priorities for measures like reducing fuel loads in public areas, building defensible spaces, and making homes more fire-resistant, drawing on public funds and private donations. The pilot project also gave homeowners individual fire risk assessments and to-do lists, offering grants to spur owners of the highest-priority homes to act.

The effort is already starting to produce results. Tyrolian Village saw its home insurance premiums drop by one-third. Berry said that this kind of targeted risk reduction could be applied in many places.

Insurance looms in the background of any discussion of disasters. In California, insurance companies have been dropping customers whose wildfire risks were too hot to handle. In states like Florida and Louisiana, some private insurers have stopped insuring new properties, gone bankrupt, or left the market entirely. The federally backed National Flood Insurance Program is continually losing billions of dollars. So, a project that measurably reduces risks is encouraging.

Yet, there are still many people in the community who are reluctant to grapple with the threats they face. “We emailed everyone. We sent postcards. We said open your reports, so you know what to do, and only 50 of the homeowners have opened their reports,” Berry said.

It's also important to remember that risk forecasts aren't guarantees, and climate change isn't the only factor at play. Plenty of homes that aren't in established flood zones still flood, while some in high-risk areas have kept their basements dry. The same goes for homes inside and outside high fire-risk zones.

Still, having even a vague sense of where risks to property are higher and lower can be useful for planning things like storm drains and seawalls. Individual homebuyers could start to include climate risk assessments in their home inspections, checking structures for fire-resistant materials and water runoff alongside termite damage and cracks in the foundation.

But, that requires buyers to realize these perils are out there. Past research showed that another driver of real estate prices in vulnerable areas was belief in climate change. Homes in at-risk communities where people took threats of rising temperatures seriously sold for less than in flood zones where residents did not think climate change was a problem.

People also quickly forget the lessons of past disasters, often rebuilding and expanding in an area that's flooded or burned. And it's even harder to get people to adapt to things that they've never experienced before.

So, while forecasting climate change and adapting to emerging threats are still immense challenges, the biggest hurdle is human behavior, getting people to actually engage with the dangers they face. Hiding this information can only help sellers for a little while before the bill comes due.

﻿A decade-long study is trying to figure out what exactly is happening inside teen brains.

What's actually going on in a teenager's head? What happens in peoples' brains as they transform from children into adults? What makes young brains so quick to pick up, say, instruments or languages? And why on Earth do teenagers make some of the absurd choices they make? What were they even thinking?!

These questions might sound like the domain of parents or teachers, but they've also been explored by scientists.And a fair warning that should be pretty obvious: Scientists don't have perfect answers to any of these questions. But, they do have some really interesting techniques for trying to better understand teenaged brains. They've even been taking away some lessons from developing brains that they've tried to apply elsewhere.

In our latest series from Unexplainable, Vox's science podcast, we've picked several researchers' brains to understand what we know — and what we are still trying to figure out — about teen brains and how best to study them.

And a little over a decade ago, the National Institutes of Health wanted to figure out what kind of risk factors lead kids down the road to substance abuse. It was a question that Raul Gonzalez Jr., a professor of psychology at Florida International University, had been studying for years at that point. But, as he told Vox, the studies he was doing were often small.

“There was this recognition that to really move the field forward and understand what is a risk factor as compared to a consequence of substance use,” he said. “We really needed to start with a huge study that started with adolescents before they started experimenting or using drugs.”

And so, the NIH ultimately decided to kick off a massive project: the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, or “ABCD.” The plan was to follow thousands of kids — starting at age 9 — for a decade. At regular intervals, researchers would give them questionnaires and brain scans and track their progress as they went through their teens.

“It was going to be the study that anybody would ever want to do, but nobody would ever have the resources to do,” Gonzalez said.

Gonzalez wound up becoming the head of the Florida site, one of 21 ABCD sites across the country. And he says that, once other adolescence researchers got wind of just how many kids were going to be studied (about 12,000 at this point) and for how long, they wanted to add their own questions.

Now, a decade into the project, they've collected a treasure trove of data on everything from adolescent screen time to sleep and exercise regimens to family situations. They've collected data on how the kids approach various games, and they scanned their growing brains in MRI machines.Already, this study has led to over 1400 papers, teasing out different aspects of teen brain development. But Gonzalez says data is still coming in, and he's looking forward to pouring through it to keep understanding what's going on in the minds of teenagers.

There are some things we do know about developing brains, though.

In the first few years of our lives, our brains make lots and lots of synapses, connections between our neurons that let them pass signals to one another. And then, as we get older, brains prune a lot of those connections back. So, perhaps counterintuitively, in the period of adolescence when you're learning a lot, it actually seems like your brain is eliminating some connections while strengthening others.

“Use it or lose it,” said Alison Barth, a professor of Biological Sciences at Carnegie Mellon. “If you don't use it, maybe you're just gonna get rid of it.”

This process might seem inefficient. Why build up HUGE numbers of connections…only to then get rid of them?This was, in fact, the question that two of Barth's computer scientist colleagues raised when she told them about the brain's synaptic pruning back in the 2010s.

But, when they all started working together exploring synaptic pruning in a mouse brain and trying to see what lessons it might have to teach them about building computer networks outside of a brain, they found that the brain's counterintuitive technique for learning might actually be worth learning from.

﻿DNA synthesis is going global. The biosecurity rules aren't keeping up.

Almost 20 years ago, James Randerson ordered a sequence of smallpox DNA. Smallpox is the only human disease to have ever been successfully eradicated — 46 years ago as of yesterday. It's one of the deadliest infections in human history, killing about 500 million people over three millennia — with 300 million of those deaths estimated to have occurred in the last century alone.

If someone — like a disgruntled scientist, terror group, or rogue nation — were to synthesize and unleash smallpox, we could see the reemergence of a disease that killed three out of 10 people it infected, one that the vast majority of humanity is now no longer protected against.

Thankfully, Randerson was a journalist for The Guardian writing an exposé on the lax customer screening policies of DNA synthesis companies, rather than an aspiring bioterrorist.

Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

“All it took was a[n] invented company name, a mobile phone number, a free email address and a house in north London to receive the order by post,” Randerson wrote.

In the nearly 20 years since, the field has grown massively. DNA synthesis is a cornerstone of modern biotechnological research: Scientists order synthetic DNA to develop gene therapies, engineer bacteria to improve agricultural output, create new vaccines, and much more.

But when you can order certain genetic sequences, you can potentially build harmful pathogens as well. Companies need to ensure that they aren't sending the building blocks of a possible bioweapon to malicious actors, but the demand for synthetic DNA is growing worldwide. It's never been cheaper — or easier — to write genetic code. And regulations and the ability to institute safeguards vary significantly depending on where you are.

That's why the International Biosecurity and Biosafety Initiative for Science (IBBIS), an NGO dedicated to safeguarding modern bioscience and biotechnology, launched the Global DNA Synthesis Map on Tuesday at a side event at the Biological Weapons Convention working group at the United Nations in Geneva.

The interactive map draws upon data from more than 80 countries to highlight their screening practices, regulatory frameworks, and access to DNA synthesis.

“When we started this project a year ago, there was no comprehensive overview of the DNA synthesis landscape,”Mayra Ameneiros, a senior fellow at IBBIS and the map's project lead, told me. It's the first public and continuously updated look at where DNA synthesis providers operate around the world, including not just the major players like China and the US, but previously neglected regions like Latin America and Africa.

The map currently shows 1,023 DNA synthesis companies operating across 81 countries. It also spotlights regions with established regulatory frameworks and DNA synthesis screening requirements, allowing users to compare countries and territories with each other and notice where gaps exist.

And companies can benefit from paying attention to gaps that the map highlights. “For the private sector, this is important because companies could face legal consequences if they unknowingly sell a risky sequence to a bad actor,” Ameneiros said. “If something goes wrong, the company that made the sale will always be held responsible.”

The map reveals that only 10 percent of synthetic DNA providers currently screen for DNA sequences of concern, meaning that companies could be sending out the makings of a dangerous pathogen. That's a tremendous biosecurity gap. More than 700 companies provide synthetic nucleic acids, the building blocks of genetic material, and benchtop DNA synthesis devices, which allow scientists to synthesize custom DNA sequences in their own labs rather than ordering it from a commercial provider. More than 500 of those companies need to screen orders to guarantee compliance with local regulations.

But effective screening could become more challenging as DNA synthesis technologies are becoming increasingly decentralized. With the advent of benchtop DNA synthesis devices, people don't even have to wait for their orders to arrive to start using the synthetic DNA. More people can have access to this technology than ever before. This is of particular concern in the Global South, where there are often fewer regulations.

And then there's the effect of AI, which can enable the design of novel DNA sequences. That can speed up the pace of life-saving gene therapy development — but it can also help facilitate the creation of novel pathogens. And just as we can use AI to improve screening, it can also be used to evade existing screening software tools.

As these technologies improve and become more accessible, they must be increasingly safeguarded as the barrier to entry to weaponize them decreases. Keeping sequences of concern out of potentially dangerous hands becomes that much more important, and the map aims to facilitate that.

Ultimately, IBBIS hopes the map, which will be continually updated as a live resource, will inform standards around best screening practices, with the aim of eventually turning a dizzying patchwork array of regulations into a workable international standard. Without one, the world will be in much greater danger from lab-made pathogens than it was when James Randerson ordered smallpox sequences to his home nearly 20 years ago.

The Federal Reserve will announce its December interest rate decision at 2 p.m. ET Wednesday. Business Insider will be covering developments live throughout the day, including economists' insights, market moves, and what either a Fed rate cut or hold means for your wallet.

Check back here for updates — and tune into our live Q&A with reporters this afternoon at 4 p.m. ET.

Trump has consistently put pressure on Powell to cut rates. ""Jerome 'Too Late' Powell should have lowered rates long ago,"" the president wrote in a September Truth Social post. ""As usual, he's ""Too Late!""

Still, Powell has minimized the impact of White House influence: ""We are strongly committed to maintaining our independence,"" he said in September. ""It's deeply in our culture to do our job based on the incoming data and never consider anything else.""

Like most of Wall Street, UBS sees the Fed cutting by 25 basis points on Wednesday.

Brian Buetel, managing director of UBS Wealth Management, believes that the easing cycle will continue into early 2026, with two additional rate cuts expected after December. For that reason, he expects the stock market to continue inching higher into year-end.

""The combination of lower rates, artificial intelligence, more productivity and additional fiscal support from government spending on infrastructure could help the markets achieve escape velocity in 2026.""

Ahead of today's meeting, economists told Business Insider that the Fed is looking at a murky economic picture  — but there's no major cause for alarm.

Claudia Sahm, the chief economist for New Century Advisors, expects the Fed to cut rates today but remain more cautious in the new year: ""I have a feeling that if all goes well in the economy, the Fed probably is not going to be doing a whole lot because they took steps right now to ensure against the worst outcomes,"" she said. ""Then it's just going to take time for the inflation to start moving back down.""

""Then it's just going to take time for the inflation to start moving back down.""

Indeed Hiring Lab economist Cory Stahle said ""We're still off to one of the worst starts we've had since 2010 after you take out the pandemic"" from a labor market standpoint.

At the macro level, more Fed cuts would be good news for jobs. If companies can borrow money more cheaply, it would free up funds to hire and pay employees, which would speed up labor market churn and encourage more consumer spending.

Job growth has substantially slowed in recent months, and the Fed's cuts at its last two meetings aimed in part to stem that decline.

Without the most timely jobs and price data, the Fed may have to lean more on soft economic indicators. Consumer sentiment is making a recovery following midyear dips, but remains low.

On recent earnings calls, leaders at major companies like Amazon, Walmart, and more have said they are feeling the heat of tariffs and hoping to streamline their workforces. Many major employers have announced layoffs and cost cutting in 2025, with some carving out their middle management tier.

Investors anticipate a rate cut on Wednesday, with more to follow in 2026, but longer-term bond yields have been steadily rising. The 10-year Treasury yield is up 20 basis points from its November low, hovering around 4.20% on Wednesday.

Sources say the bond market is telegraphing a growing anxiety about the path of inflation in 2026. Trump ally Kevin Hassett, who recently shot to the top of the list of most likely next Fed chiefs, could lower rates aggressively if he takes over from Jerome Powell next year.

The calculus being made in the bond market seems to be that Hassett could lower rates too far, too fast, aggravating inflation and prompting a hawkish response from the Fed down the road.

Powell has been the Fed chair since 2018 and his term ends in May 2026. Trump is set to announce his successor early next year — a decision that will steer future monetary policy.

Frontrunners to lead the central bank include Trump's economic advisor Kevin Hassett, Fed Governor Christopher Waller, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and Chief Investment Officer of global fixed income at BlackRock Rick Rieder.

Fed leaders have shown uncharacteristic division in their decision-making this year. Minutes from recent meetings show that some Federal Open Market Committee members would prefer larger and more consistent interest rate cuts.

President Donald Trump has also been a vocal advocate for lower rates, at times threatening to fire Powell before the end of the chair's term. Trump appointee and Fed newcomer Stephen Miran joined the committee in August and has consistently pushed for more aggressive rate reductions.

The stock market opened nearly flat ahead of the 2 p.m. ET rate move. The S&P 500 was hovering around 6,840, while the Dow was up slightly to 47,580.

The week has been mostly quiet as investors await the central bank's decision. Major indexes are hovering close to records after climbing back from a tech-led sell-off in November. Investors are eagerly awaiting more rate cuts to help fuel further gains in 2026 as stocks head into the fourth year of the bull market.

The most recently released unemployment rate was still low, a little over 4%, but has slowly crept up this year. Job seeker frustration is compounded by a decline in job openings over the last few years.​​

Some demographics are also experiencing job market challenges more than others. Twenty-something college graduates are increasingly stuck submitting applications into the void, and the unemployment rate for Black Americans is nearly twice that of the general population.

The most timely inflation data won't be released in time for today's meeting, but Powell and his colleagues can look back on recent trends. Inflation rates remained above the Fed's 2% goal throughout 2025. The consumer price index — a key measure of inflation — cooled during the first few months of the year but began to creep up again in May.

Business Insider also asked our readers in November how prices have changed. About 200 readers responded; many said that the cost of groceries, dining out, and coffee has increased.

While investors expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points, officials will probably send out some hawkish signals to the market on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs said.

Fed officials will likely suggest that the bar is higher for rate cuts going into next year, David Mericle, Goldman's chief US economist, wrote in a client note on Sunday. There will also likely be a handful of central bankers who will give ""soft dissents"" on where they see monetary policy going forward in the dot plot, he added.

The Fed is expected to pencil in just one more rate cut in 2026, followed by one rate cut in 2027, per Goldman's forecast.

With 60 minutes until the US stock market opens, it still looks like investors plan to spend Wednesday morning very much in wait-and-see mode.

As of 8:30 a.m. ET, futures tied to the Dow and the S&P 500 are roughly 0.1% higher, while Nasdaq futures are 0.25% lower.

Minimal moves in futures mirror Tuesday's quiet trading session, which saw the S&P 500 lose 0.1%, the Dow lose 0.4%, and the Nasdaq gain 0.1%

If the current pattern of rate cuts continues, American consumers may soon feel relief. Thirty-year fixed mortgages, two-year auto loans, and credit card rates tend to fluctuate alongside the federal funds rate.

And, while inflation remains above the Fed's 2% goal, mortgage rates have largely cooled in recent months in anticipation of rate reductions. Lower rates could also make home equity lines and small business loans more affordable — though savers might see less return on their high-yield savings accounts.

Investors seem to be pricing in a ""sell the news"" reaction to Wednesday's rate decision, strategists at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note on Monday.

The bank added, though, that it remains optimistic about the market's direction over the medium term. That's because the job market looks on track to show moderate weakness in the coming months, which should clear the path for Fed rate cuts in 2026. Stronger earnings should also help lift the market higher, the bank said.

Powell has said the Fed's cautious strategy this year stems from uncertainty over President Donald Trump's fast-changing tariff policies and stubborn inflation rates. The job market, meanwhile, has had a rocky 2025.

Business Insider has heard from frustrated job seekers at all levels of the career ladder, particularly those feeling pushed out of white collar roles. This past summer, the number of Americans looking for work eclipsed the number of vacancies, though the unemployment rate itself is still relatively low.

""There is no risk-free path for policy as we navigate this tension between our employment and inflation goals,"" Powell said in October, adding, ""Ultimately, lower rates will support more demand, and that'll support hiring over time. And, of course, we also have to be careful about this.""

The Fed's dual mandate is to keep America's prices stable and the labor market healthy. These two goals have been challenging to balance this year: higher interest rates can help curb inflation but risk cooling down an already chilly labor market.

The Fed is also missing key pieces of data due to the government shutdown. The Bureau of Labor Statistics canceled the October consumer price index and unemployment rate releases, and the November jobs report and inflation data won't be released in time for today's meeting. December's decision will be more difficult without this information.

US stock futures are virtually unmoved as of just before 6:20 a.m. ET. Futures for all three of the Dow Jones, the Nasdaq, and the S&P 500 have moved less than 0.1% lower so far in this morning's trading.

There's a little more movement in European stocks, though nothing too drastic. Britain's benchmark, the FTSE 100, is up 0.2% on the day to 9,660, while Germany's DAX is 0.5% lower.

Fed leaders have kept monetary policy moderately restrictive in recent months, holding rates steady until September before introducing two quarter-point cuts.

Chair Jerome Powell said in the last meeting that a rate change in December is ""not a foregone conclusion, far from it"" and ""policy is not on a preset course,"" though on Wednesday morning, CME FedWatch is showing a roughly 90% chance of another quarter-point reduction.

Investors and consumers are hopeful for more cuts. Americans could see more affordable mortgage, auto, and credit card rates in the new year, and businesses would be able to borrow money more easily — a move that could juice the sluggish job market.

Business Insider Edition 

Ghana has issued a firm protest to Israel after several of its nationals were detained and deported at Ben Gurion International Airport, a development that has sharpened diplomatic unease but falls short of any formal rupture in relations.


        In a statement released in Accra, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was appalled by what it described as the unjustifiable and humiliating treatment of Ghanaian travellers.
    


        According to the ministry, seven citizens, including four members of a parliamentary delegation attending an international cybersecurity conference in Tel Aviv, were detained on Sunday, December 7, and released only after more than five hours of diplomatic intervention. Three others were deported to Ghana on the next available flight.
    


        Officials in Accra say the pattern suggests that Ghanaian travellers were deliberately targeted and subjected to inhumane treatment.
    


        The ministry rejected Israel's justification that the deportations resulted from the alleged non-cooperation of the Ghanaian Embassy in Tel Aviv, insisting that the mission had acted responsibly and in line with international law.
    


        The incident has struck a sensitive point in a relationship that, while historically cooperative, has seen moments of friction in recent years. 
    


        Ghana and Israel maintain full diplomatic ties, and officials from both sides regularly affirm their determination to deepen cooperation in trade, agriculture, health, and security.
    


        However, the airport episode adds to a set of existing disagreements that have quietly shaped their recent interactions.
    


        These issues include differing views on the Israel-Hamas conflict. Ghana initially expressed strong support for Israel after the October 7 attack. 
    


        Still, more recent criticism of Israeli military operations in Gaza, including remarks by some Ghanaian officials describing the actions as genocidal, has generated debate at home and possible diplomatic strain abroad.
    


        Israel has also taken issue with Ghana's voting patterns at the United Nations, where Accra often aligns with the wider African bloc on resolutions concerning Israel.
    


        Migration has created another point of friction. The Israeli ambassador to Ghana has publicly stated that a visa-free arrangement is unlikely in the near term due to concerns about some Ghanaians overstaying their visas.
    


        These disagreements remain far from a breakdown in relations. The two countries have navigated periods of tension before, most notably in 1973 when Ghana, alongside many African states, severed ties after the Yom Kippur War and an OAU resolution. Diplomatic relations were later restored and have since grown into a steady partnership.
    


        Even so, Accra says the latest incident is inconsistent with the spirit of their bilateral history.
    


        The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will summon Israeli embassy officials to register its displeasure and is weighing possible reciprocal measures.
    


        As both governments reaffirm their desire for deeper cooperation, the handling of this dispute may determine how resilient the partnership remains in an increasingly complex geopolitical environment.

CEO John Stankey said he made some missteps in addressing company culture at AT&T — and shed some new light on his internal memo that went viral.

The lengthy memo, which was first reported by Business Insider in August, described how the company was moving to a ""more market-based culture,"" setting off discourse about the state of workplace loyalty.

Stankey gave some insight into the goal behind the memo during a conversation at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council Summit on Tuesday.

When asked to name a mistake he's made, Stankey said he was too slow to tackle the ""culture evolution"" that was needed. He said he put it among several areas of focus for the company and that instead he should've put it at the forefront and forced specific actions to make it happen.

Alan Murray, president of the WSJ Leadership Institute, suggested that was why Stanley sent that memo this year, rather than sooner.

""The memo shouldn't be over-rotated on. It's one of a series of steps in trying to put a framework out there and remove excuses for leaders to lead,"" Stankey said, adding the memo gave context on the framework he was building for the business.

""That memo outlined my point of view on it, and it gives leaders that want to lead all the air cover in the world they need to go and execute around that framework,"" he said.

AT&T has undergone a number of changes as a company in the past year, including a return-to-office mandate of five days a week.

In the memo to employees, Stankey effectively said they should get on board with changes to the company culture, or get out.

""We run a dynamic, customer-facing business, tackling large-scale, challenging initiatives,"" Stankey said in the memo. ""If the requirements dictated by this dynamic do not align to your personal desires, you have every right to find a career opportunity that is suitable to your aspirations and needs.""

At the event on Tuesday, Stankey also outlined how AT&T is pushing employees to adopt AI. He said the company has tutorials and other educational tools for employees to upskill with AI, and that he's paying attention to who is using them.

""I want to see who's building their skill set, where they're building, and this is just the next set of skills that people are going to have to have,"" he said.

This summer, after Meta made a $14 billion investment in Scale AI and poached its 28-year-old founder, Alexandr Wang, and after A-list clients like OpenAI and Google halted work with the startup, a worker for Scale AI anxiously asked ChatGPT what it thought of his company's fate. He knew the chatbot well, having tested it for vulnerabilities. Its prognosis was grim.

""Scale AI will no longer exist as a credible independent entity within 24 months,"" ChatGPT, which isn't any kind of official authority, wrote. ""Its infrastructure will be repurposed for Meta's internal needs. Its client base will evaporate. Its role as a neutral red teamer or external evaluator is effectively over.""

The contractor shared the chat logs with fellow workers at Scale AI. In one reply reviewed by Business Insider, one worker said that they were already on their way out, describing the startup as a ticking time bomb.

The chatbot was drawing from a storm of headlines about Scale AI, which until this summer had been touted as one of the most ascendant startups in tech — the place Big Tech companies vying for AI supremacy went to when they wanted their chatbots stress-tested and perfected. Lately, it's lost some of its gleam, with investors significantly lowering valuations, workers sniping about pay, and rivals coming for its clientele.

The vast army of human data labelers that made Scale AI a juggernaut are chafing at what they say are pay cuts, lengthy unpaid onboarding sessions to join new AI projects, and thinning workloads — and are increasingly leaving the platform altogether, according to interviews with five current and former contractors and internal correspondence obtained by Business Insider.

Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today.

Activity in the main internal chatroom for Outlier — Scale AI's flagship gig work platform, which touts more than 100,000 taskers — has plummeted since the Meta investment, with weekly discussion threads drawing dozens instead of the usual hundreds of replies, according to screenshots reviewed by Business Insider.

One tasker said that they'd spent close to 40 hours in a single month in unpaid onboarding sessions without landing any actual work, noting that other platforms like Scale AI's rival Mercor do pay for this kind of work. Elizabeth Boyd, another tasker, says she rarely does work for Outlier anymore after seeing effective pay rates for some projects slashed to around $20 an hour — down from the $50 she used to make. One gig that advertised $20 an hour only allowed three minutes of working time every two days, or a 99-cent payout, according to screenshots obtained by Business Insider.

Joe Osborne, a Scale AI spokesperson, says the balance sheets show the company is on the right path. ""This quarter is on track to be our biggest of 2025, our data business is more profitable today than it was before the Meta deal, and our applications business, which includes work with Fortune 500 companies and governments, has doubled revenue"" in the second half of the year compared to the first, Osborne wrote in an email. He also noted there has been an increase in active users on Outlier since the Meta deal, and that pay rates are based on the skills for each project and contributors always see the rates upfront, and have the option of declining any gig.

The company is also looking to diversify. The startup has embraced fields like robotics, announcing a new lab to meet booming demand for robot training data this fall. It's doubling down on its US military and other government work, winning up to $199 million worth of defense contracts since the Meta deal.

Some investors are bullish. In one current investor's view, Meta has mostly left Scale alone, letting it operate as an independent company. With around $1 billion on the balance sheet, the investor added, there are no plans to fundraise. And an IPO could still be on the table at some point.

Other investors see Scale AI as more like a gutted fish. The Meta investment — which valued Scale AI at $29 billion — has dented Scale AI's valuation in private markets where people buy and sell equity from pre-IPO startups. Noel Moldvai, Augment's CEO, tells Business Insider his platform used to process millions of dollars' worth of transactions in Scale AI stock before the Meta deal, but that dried up as sellers waited to see if the startup rebounded. Activity is picking up again, he said, but at lower valuations of around $15 billion to $9 billion. The underlying message of Meta's semi-acquisition is clear to Moldvai. ""It seems like Meta was just after Alexandr Wang, and so this is probably the structure that let them get him,"" he says. He adds that Scale AI's valuation could still bounce back.

On another marketplace, Caplight, Scale's valuation has dropped to $7.3 billion. Osborne says that the valuation is not accurate because there have been no sales of stock at that price and multiples of comparable companies would yield a higher valuation.

If the company doesn't pull it off, it could become the latest example of a once-promising startup that morphed into a ""zombie"" after being invested in by a tech giant.

This summer, Scale AI painted a rosy picture of the Meta investment, describing it as a major cash infusion and source of future work in its official statement at the time of the deal. That messaging was also conveyed to the startup's corporate workforce, says another former member of Scale AI's red team, which tests chatbots for flaws and vulnerabilities. Just a few weeks after the investment, he was laid off as part of a major downsizing that saw 14% of Scale AI's full-time staff of 1,400 let go.

Osborne said the layoffs were aimed at making the data division profitable, which it now is.

Those weren't the only cuts. In September, Scale AI terminated 12 contractors on its red team, citing performance issues. Two ex-red teamers told Business Insider that the team's work had been drying up since the Meta deal, blaming thinning workloads for the cuts. Later that month, Scale AI shuttered a team in Dallas of contractors focused on generalist AI work as it moved towards more specialized fields.

Osborne said the 12 contractors were part of Scale's temporary workforce and represented a small fraction of its overall red team, which the company is still committed to investing in. He said the Dallas cuts were part of an industry shift towards higher skilled work and represent a small fraction of its overall workforce.

Meanwhile, a swarm of AI training startups has rushed in to poach Scale AI's workers and clients. Some are now raising capital at soaring valuations. Surge AI hit a valuation of $24 billion while Mercor, which is run by three 22-year-olds, announced in October it had raised $350 million at a $10 billion valuation.

Mercor has won at least one major AI training project from Meta, Scale AI's 49% shareholder. In September, Scale AI filed a lawsuit in California against Mercor alleging it hired one of its sales employees to poach its biggest customers, allegations Mercor denies.

One Scale AI investor said he'd been frustrated with Scale AI's leadership losing customers to Surge AI in particular, which reportedly brought in more revenue than Scale in 2024, despite never having raised outside funding. (Scale AI had raised more than $1.5 billion before the Meta deal.)

Brendan Foody, Mercor's CEO, has publicly criticized Scale AI for what he claims are low pay rates and data quality issues. ""Scale lost the focus on product, on scaling quality,"" Foody said in a September podcast appearance. In response, a Scale AI spokesperson told Business Insider its quality metrics are at ""record highs.""

It's not just rival CEOs making that point. Tammy Hartline, who managed projects for Scale AI as a consultant until the summer of 2025, said Scale grew so quickly that the work became more about needing bodies than skills. ""Spam and low quality data became accepted as a cost of doing business,"" she said. Hartline joined Mercor in September.

Scale AI has also been beset with security issues that predate Meta's investment. In June, Business Insider reported that Scale AI routinely used public Google Docs to track work for high-profile customers, including Google, Meta, and xAI. That practice left AI training documents labeled ""confidential"" accessible to anyone with the link and exposed reams of personal information, like private emails and pay details, about contractors. ""We take data security seriously,"" Osborne said. ""We conducted a thorough investigation and disabled any user's ability to publicly share documents from Scale managed systems.""

Sloppy security isn't uncommon in the AI training space — Surge AI similarly left open sensitive work for its client Anthropic. But the exposed documents seen by Business Insider show that for a project for Google, Scale AI faced security and quality issues throughout 2023 and 2024. Thousands of taskers were flagged for being ""suspected spammers,"" ""cheaters,"" with hundreds of workers listed in spreadsheets with titles like ""Good and Bad Folks"" and ""suspicious non-US taskers."" Meta recently removed more than 40 groups buying and reselling AI training accounts, including from Scale AI, in response to a recent Business Insider investigation. Osborne said Scale's data quality metrics are the highest they've ever been.

The company has notched some recent wins. It once appeared bogged down by litigation, but recently agreed to settle multiple lawsuits filed by ex-workers in California who alleged they were underpaid and misclassified as contractors. (Scale no longer accepts gig workers from the state.) The big question remains whether Scale AI can thrive in the increasingly competitive AI training industry it helped give birth to. For many former workers, it'll be too late to find out.

Silver blew past $60 per troy ounce for the first time on Tuesday, extending its blistering rally as traders race into a metal increasingly linked to the build-out of AI infrastructure.

The milestone caps a stunning run in 2025: silver has more than doubled this year, far outpacing gold's roughly 60% gain and leaving many traditional commodity forecasts in the dust.

While expectations of further Federal Reserve easing have helped fuel the move, surging industrial demand and persistent supply tightness are also powering silver's fierce price gains.

Veteran Wall Street strategist Ed Yardeni wrote on Tuesday that silver's explosive rally can't be understood without acknowledging its growing importance to the AI economy.

As AI data-center construction accelerates and chip demand rises, he argues the metal has effectively become ""another AI play.""

Industry association The Silver Institute and Oxford Economics reinforced that view in a report released on Tuesday, saying AI's rapid expansion is helping drive growing demand for silver across digital economy applications.

""As digitalisation and AI adoption accelerate, so too does the demand for critical materials involved in their applications — silver a critical one among them,"" they wrote.

Data centers increasingly rely on next-generation chips such as GPUs and TPUs equipped with high-performance semiconductors that use silver in their internal connections and packaging, the association wrote. 

And as AI moves into autonomous vehicles, robotics, and edge devices, the broader electronics ecosystem is set to draw even more heavily on silver-rich components.

Beyond AI demand, silver remains entrenched in a tight market, with inventories strained and borrowing rates still high despite some easing after October's historic squeeze.

""This is unquestionably a tight market, stocks are falling, and traders want whatever scraps of silver they can get their hands on,"" wrote Chris Weston, the head of research at Pepperstone, in a Tuesday note.

He added that retail traders are taking sharp notice of silver's surge, and for good reason. 

""It is an emphatic move, with trend and momentum accounts absolutely bossing the show,"" wrote Weston.

Despite its red-hot rally, the silver trade remains a risky one, Goldman Sachs cautioned in October.

Silver is far more cyclical because of its heavy industrial use, making it a less reliable hedge than gold, the bank said. It also lacks the support of central-bank buying that underpins the yellow metal, Goldman added.

In Silicon Valley, where bold technical bets abound, few bets look bolder than trying to break the grip of Nvidia's CUDA, a software stack that's quietly become the operating system of the AI boom.

That's what Modular, a startup founded by software gurus from Apple and Google, is trying to do.

Cofounders Chris Lattner and Tim Davis have spent decades building the software plumbing that sits beneath the modern tech industry. Lattner is famous for creating Apple's Swift programming language. He also built the software underpinning Google's TPU AI chips, with Modular cofounder Tim Davis.

They're now aiming that expertise at CUDA itself. The attempt borders on madness, but it's the kind of audacious project that could transform the AI industry.

""It's seen by a lot of people as somewhat crazy,"" said Kylan Gibbs, CEO of startup Inworld AI and a former product manager at Google DeepMind. ""That's where Chris has the advantage: He's smart enough to actually know how to do it, and somewhat crazy enough to set out to do it.""

CUDA began life almost 20 years ago as a way to make graphics chips programmable. Today, it has grown into a multilayered software ecosystem — language, libraries, compilers, inference systems — that most AI companies rely on.

That success comes at a cost: Most of the industry is now optimized around a single vendor's hardware. CUDA binds AI workloads to Nvidia GPUs. That is great for Nvidia, but deeply limiting for everyone else.

On the surface, there seems to be a ton of competition: AMD sells GPUs. Google has TPUs. Amazon created Trainium AI chips, and a host of startups are building similar hardware.

The problem is that each chip comes with its own software stack optimized just for that component. That means an endless reinvention of the wheel. Most of the time, it's simpler to just stick with CUDA — and Nvidia's GPUs.

And yet, AI developers crave portability: Being able to use any combination of GPUs from multiple providers without juggling different software stacks.

""Nobody is building portable stuff, because why would anyone work on software for more than one chip when the chip projects themselves are doing the software?"" Lattner, Modular's CEO, told me in an interview.

Nvidia could extend CUDA to run well on rival AI chips. But doing so would undermine Nvidia's greatest moat: the closed-loop bond between its software and its chips. ""Obviously, they don't want portability,"" he said.

For Lattner, this paradox presents a big opportunity.

""We realized there's nobody in the industry that's actually incentivized to do this. It's very expensive, very hard,"" he said. ""And at the same time, everybody wants it.""

That's what inspired Lattner and Davis to leave Google and start Modular in 2022, the year ChatGPT took the world by storm.

Since then, Modular has raised $380 million from investors including Greylock, General Catalyst, and GV, Google's venture capital arm. The latest financing in September valued the startup at $1.6 billion. Modular isn't the only effort to break the CUDA lock-in. There has been ZLUDA, an open-source project that was funded by AMD, and more recently, the startup Spectral Compute, which has raised $6 million.

Lattner has used some of this money to hire talented programmers from Google, Apple, and other tech companies. They spent three years working in relative obscurity to create the building blocks of a new AI software stack.

The foundation starts with a brand-new programming language, called Mojo, that offers deep controls for making AI chips run as efficiently as possible.

Modular designed this to work similarly to Python, a popular and easy-to-use programming language. But Mojo also has the speed and power of other, more complex languages, such as C++, that are essential for AI development. Mojo also works well with PyTorch, an open-source framework that is often used when building AI models and applications.

I first heard about Modular earlier this year when interviewing Carles Gelada, a former OpenAI researcher. ""There are several interesting projects to create GPU-agnostic frameworks and platforms, and challenge CUDA,"" he said at the time. ""Mojo is the most interesting one.""

MAX is the next major layer of Modular's new software stack. It powers AI inference, which is how models are run. This part of the system works with Nvidia GPUs, AMD GPUs, and similar chips from Apple. Modular hopes to add more AI chips in the future.

On top of that is another layer called Mammoth, which helps AI developers manage GPU clusters.

In late September, Modular announced that it got top performance out of Nvidia's new Blackwell B200 GPUs and AMD's latest MI355X GPUs — crucially on the same software platform.

Lattner said Modular got these AMD GPUs to perform roughly 50% better than when these chips run on AMD's own software.

More importantly, the ability to run different GPUs on the same software stack now supports the tantalizing opportunity to compare Nvidia's offerings with rival AI chips on a more level playing field.

""The obvious question is: can MI355X compete with Blackwell?"" Modular wrote in a blog announcing the results. ""Early signs point to yes.""

Gibbs, the CEO of Inworld AI, has been putting Modular's software through its paces in the real world.

Inworld builds high-speed, real-time conversational AI technology that supports offerings from big companies, including Disney, NBCUniversal, and Niantic Labs.

Earlier this year, when the startup designed a new text-to-speech AI model and got early access to Nvidia B200 GPUs, they issued Modular a challenge: Cut our costs by 60% and reduce our latency by 40% and we'll work with you.

""Within about four weeks, we were able to get this incredible performance,"" said Gibbs, who signed a partnership deal with Modular soon after. ""I've bet with my wallet.""

While Inworld was mostly lured by Modular's performance gains on Nvidia's latest GPUs, Gibbs likes the flexibility of using different AI chips more easily in the future, if needed.

""The promise is that we'd be able to move to new hardware,"" he said. ""Let's say AMD takes off, let's say TPUs take off for Google, or there could be other new hardware that comes online. So it's nice to have that optionality.""

In fact, Google's TPUs are suddenly having a moment. The internet giant released a new AI model called Gemini 3 to rave reviews recently. That was trained and run using TPUs, and some other AI companies have signed deals to use these chips instead of, or alongside of, Nvidia GPUs.

That's put Nvidia on the defensive. A project like Modular, with its promise of portability across different AI hardware, adds to this pressure.

""Nvidia could kill this in a day,"" said Gibbs of the Modular project. ""Nvidia could basically say, 'okay, we don't really care that you run just on Nvidia hardware. Here's a CUDA option that runs on AMD GPUs as well.' It'd be a bit crazy for them to do that, but it's something they could do and that would of course be somewhat bad.""

For all Lattner's critique of the industry, he says Modular is not trying to kill Nvidia. In fact, he argues that Nvidia will continue to thrive, even if Modular succeeds spectacularly.

""We're trying to build something like Android, but for AI hardware,"" he told me, referring to Google's mobile operating system that powers most of the world's smartphones.

Despite billions of people using Android devices, this success didn't kill iOS, Apple's mobile operating system. iPhones still rule in the US, for example.

Lattner thinks something similar will happen in AI as Modular's software makes other hardware more competitive, giving developers more freedom, and chipping away at the industry's single-vendor monoculture.

""So Nvidia doesn't have to die, but we do want more competition. We do want more innovation,"" he said. ""I think that's good for the world.""

President Donald Trump is standing by his tariffs, at least in theory.

Under the banner ""Lower Prices, Bigger Paychecks,"" Trump kicked off the first of a series of speeches to promote his economic message in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, as polls indicate the country is increasingly concerned about the rising cost of living.

""They always have a hoax,"" Trump told the crowd, referring to criticism from Democrats that his policies drove up prices. ""The new word is 'affordability.'""

""Democrats are like, 'prices are too high.' Yeah, they're too high because they cause them to be too high,"" Trump added. ""But now they're coming down.""

Later, he said, ""I can't say affordability is a hoax because I agree the prices were too high. So I can't go to call it a hoax because they'll misconstrue that.""

Trump, during the 90-minute speech, also reiterated that his favorite word is ""tariff"" and credited his policies for bringing in ""hundreds of billions of dollars,"" presumably for the government in tariff revenue.

""You can give up certain products,"" Trump said at one point. ""You could give up pencils. Because under the China policy, you know, every child can get 37 pencils. They only need one or two, you know. They don't need that many.""

Despite standing by his tariff policies, Trump has, in reality, rolled back many of his earlier tariffs, especially ones enacted on April 2. 

Tariffs are still higher than they have been in many decades, but the original 25% tariff on every import from Mexico and Canada was walked back to exclude all items covered in the USMCA trade agreement, which includes most imports from the two neighbors. Tariffs on imports from China, once more than 100%, have been reduced to a baseline tariff of 10%, which applies to all other countries.

On top of that, in an attempt to address the price of groceries, Trump also modified and removed tariffs on a range of food products in November, such as beef, coffee, bananas, and tomatoes.

Of the remaining tariffs, evidence points to an impact on the price of consumer goods.

""Our analysis suggests that tariff measures are already exerting measurable upward pressure on consumer prices,"" according to a report published in October by the Federal Reserve of St. Louis that looked at data from January to August of this year. ""The rise in prices beginning in early 2025 coincides closely with tariff developments, and our model-based regressions confirm that these effects are statistically and economically significant.""

""At the same time, the pass-through remains partial; only a portion of the model-predicted effect has materialized so far,"" the report added. ""This could reflect delays in price adjustments, competitive pressure limiting firms' ability to raise prices, or expectations that the tariffs may prove temporary.""

Trump's speech comes as consumer sentiment remains low. According to the University of Michigan's survey of consumers, sentiment dropped to 51 points in November, which is the second-lowest score the index has ever recorded since 1952, narrowly topped by a score of 50 in June 2022.

Earlier on Monday, in an interview with Politico, Trump said that he would give his economy a grade of ""A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.""

Some Democrats have centered their pre-2026 midterm messaging on affordability, and several have explicitly blamed rising costs on Trump's tariff and trade policies. Zohran Mamdani, the New York City mayor-elect, with whom Trump had a meeting, also won while running primarily on making the city more affordable.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In this article

Nvidia-backed startup Starcloud trained an artificial intelligence model from space for the first time, signaling a new era for orbital data centers that could alleviate Earth's escalating digital infrastructure crisis. 

Last month, the Washington-based company launched a satellite with an Nvidia H100 graphics processing unit, sending a chip into outer space that's 100 times more powerful than any GPU compute that has been in space before. Now, the company's Starcloud-1 satellite is running and querying responses from Gemma, an open large language model from Google, in orbit, marking the first time in history that an LLM has been run on a high-powered Nvidia GPU in outer space, CNBC has learned. 

""Greetings, Earthlings! Or, as I prefer to think of you — a fascinating collection of blue and green,"" reads a message from the recently launched satellite. 

""Let's see what wonders this view of your world holds. I'm Gemma, and I'm here to observe, analyze, and perhaps, occasionally offer a slightly unsettlingly insightful commentary. Let's begin!"" the model wrote.

Starcloud wants to show outer space can be a hospitable environment for data centers, particularly as Earth-based facilities strain power grids, consume billions of gallons of water annually and produce hefty greenhouse gas emissions. The electricity consumption of data centers is projected to more than double by 2030, according to data from the International Energy Agency.

Starcloud CEO Philip Johnston told CNBC that the company's orbital data centers will have 10 times lower energy costs than terrestrial data centers.

""Anything you can do in a terrestrial data center, I'm expecting to be able to be done in space. And the reason we would do it is purely because of the constraints we're facing on energy terrestrially,"" Johnston said in an interview.

Johnston, who co-founded the startup in 2024, said Starcloud-1's operation of Gemma is proof that space-based data centers can exist and operate a variety of AI models in the future, particularly those that require large compute clusters. 

""This very powerful, very parameter dense model is living on our satellite,"" Johnston said. ""We can query it, and it will respond in the same way that when you query a chat from a database on Earth, it will give you a very sophisticated response. We can do that with our satellite.""

In a statement to CNBC, Tris Warkentin, product director at Google DeepMind, said that ""seeing Gemma run in the harsh environment of space is a testament to the flexibility and robustness of open models."" 

In addition to Gemma, Starcloud was able to train NanoGPT, an LLM created by OpenAI founding member Andrej Karpathy, on the H100 chip using the complete works of Shakespeare. This led the model to speak in Shakespearean English.

Starcloud — a member of the Nvidia Inception program and graduate from Y Combinator and the Google for Startups Cloud AI Accelerator — plans to build a 5-gigawatt orbital data center with solar and cooling panels that measure roughly 4 kilometers in both width and height. A compute cluster of that gigawatt size would produce more power than the largest power plant in the U.S. and would be substantially smaller and cheaper than a terrestrial solar farm of the same capacity, according to Starcloud's white paper.

These data centers in space would capture constant solar energy to power next-generation AI models, unhindered by the Earth's day and night cycles and weather changes. Starcloud's satellites should have a five-year lifespan given the expected lifetime of the Nvidia chips on its architecture, Johnston said. 

Orbital data centers would have real-world commercial and military use cases. Already, Starcloud's systems can enable real-time intelligence and, for example, spot the thermal signature of a wildfire the moment it ignites and immediately alert first responders, Johnston said. 

""We've linked in the telemetry of the satellite, so we linked in the vital signs that it's drawing from the sensors — things like altitude, orientation, location, speed,"" Johnston said. ""You can ask it, 'Where are you now?' and it will say 'I'm above Africa and in 20 minutes, I'll be above the Middle East.' And you could also say, 'What does it feel like to be a satellite? And it will say, 'It's kind of a bit weird.' ... It'll give you an interesting answer that you could only have with a very high-powered model.""

Starcloud is working on customer workloads by running inference on satellite imagery from observation company Capella Space, which could help spot lifeboats from capsized vessels at sea and forest fires in a certain location. The company will include several Nvidia H100 chips and integrate Nvidia's Blackwell platform onto its next satellite launch in October 2026 to offer greater AI performance. The satellite launching next year will feature a module running a cloud platform from cloud infrastructure startup Crusoe, allowing customers to deploy and operate AI workloads from space. 

""Running advanced AI from space solves the critical bottlenecks facing data centers on Earth,"" Johnston told CNBC. 

""Orbital compute offers a way forward that respects both technological ambition and environmental responsibility. When Starcloud-1 looked down, it saw a world of blue and green. Our responsibility is to keep it that way,"" he added.

Risks in operating orbital data centers remain, however. Analysts from Morgan Stanley have noted that orbital data centers could face hurdles such as harsh radiation, difficulty of in-orbit maintenance, debris hazards, and regulatory issues tied to data governance and space traffic. 

Still, tech giants are pursuing orbital data centers given the prospect of nearly limitless solar energy and greater, gigawatt-sized operations in space.

Along with Starcloud and Nvidia's efforts, several companies have announced space-based data center missions. On Nov. 4, Google unveiled a ""moonshot"" initiative titled Project Suncatcher, which aims to put solar-powered satellites into space with Google's tensor processing units. Privately owned Lonestar Data Holdings is working to put the first-ever commercial lunar data center on the moon's surface. Aetherflux, founded by former Robinhood co-founder and chief executive Baiju Bhatt, on Tuesday announced a target to deploy an orbital data center satellite in the first quarter of 2027.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has notably explored an acquisition or partnership with a rocket maker, suggesting a desire to compete against Elon Musk's SpaceX, according to The Wall Street Journal. SpaceX is a key launch partner for Starcloud.

Referring to Starcloud's launch in early November, Dion Harris, senior director of AI infrastructure at Nvidia, said: ""From one small data center, we've taken a giant leap toward a future where orbital computing harnesses the infinite power of the sun.""

In this article

Nvidia on Wednesday responded to a report that the Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek has been using smuggled Blackwell chips to develop its upcoming model. 

The U.S. has banned the export of Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which are considered the company's most advanced offerings, to China in an effort to stay ahead in the AI race. 

DeepSeek is reportedly using chips that were snuck into the country without authorization, according to The Information. 

""We haven't seen any substantiation or received tips of 'phantom datacenters' constructed to deceive us and our OEM partners, then deconstructed, smuggled, and reconstructed somewhere else,"" a Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. ""While such smuggling seems farfetched, we pursue any tip we receive.""

Nvidia has been one of the biggest winners of the AI boom so far because it develops the graphics processing units (GPUs) that are key for training models and running large workloads. 

Since the hardware is so crucial for advancing AI technology, Nvidia's relationship with China has become a political flashpoint among U.S. lawmakers. 

President Donald Trump on Monday said Nvidia can ship its H200 chips to ""approved customers"" in China and elsewhere on the condition that the U.S. will get 25% of those sales. 

The announcement was met with pushback from some Republicans. 

DeepSeek spooked the U.S. tech sector in January when it released a reasoning model, called R1, that rocketed to the top of app stores and industry leaderboards. R1 was also created at a fraction of the cost of other models in the U.S., according to some analyst estimates. 

In August, DeepSeek hinted that China will soon have its own ""next generation"" chips to support its AI models.

WATCH: Nvidia selling H200 AI chips to China is net positive, says Patrick Moorhead

CORRECTION: Nvidia responded to the report that its Blackwell chips are being used by Deepseek. The nature of the company's reply was misstated in an earlier version of this article.

BEIJING — China needs to ""accelerate"" support for domestic consumption and reduce its reliance on exports for growth, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has said.

""As the second-largest economy in the world, China is simply too big to generate much growth in exports and continuing to depend on export-like growth risks [and] furthering global trade tensions,"" Georgieva told reporters Wednesday.

She said the country has to ""accelerate"" its decades-long plan to shift away from relying on exports for growth, adding it would be ""beneficial for China, it is beneficial for the world economy.""

She said this change was ""so as not to provoke other countries to take measures to curb down Chinese exports.""

Her comments came as trade tensions between China and the U.S. have escalated, while Europe and countries like Mexico are increasingly wary of the volume of cars and other goods coming from China. China's trade surplus reached a record of more than $1 trillion for the year as of November.

Its consumer spending has remained tepid since the pandemic, partly as the ongoing real estate slump has weighed on household sentiment.

Georgieva said the IMF estimates China would have to spend about 5% of its GDP over the next three years to ""resolutely"" resolve property sector problems. She said this could be achieved with tighter management of fiscal and industrial policy.

She added that policymakers should be more proactive on finishing construction on pre-sold apartments — and be more decisive on allowing ""unviable"" Chinese developers to exit.

""We call them zombie firms. Well, let the zombies go away,"" she said.

Georgieva also said IMF analysis found that raising spending on social support, especially in rural areas, could help boost consumption by up to 3 percentage points of GDP in the medium term.

She noted the need for specific policy measures, but emphasized the need for market forces to play a greater role, especially for China's tech development and the yuan.

""What we want to see is a market-based RMB exchange rate that reflects fundamentals,"" she added.

The IMF said in a release Wednesday that China's low inflation, relative to trading partners, ""has led to real exchange rate depreciation, contributing to strong exports and rising current account surplus.""

The IMF on Wednesday also raised its forecast for China's economic growth next year to 4.5%, based on domestic stimulus and lower-than-expected tariffs.

That's a 0.3 percentage point increase from the IMF's forecast in October. The organization also raised its forecast for 2025 growth by 0.2 percentage points to 5%.

The IMF said it expects inflation in China to rise to an average of 0.8% next year, up from 0% this year.

China earlier on Wednesday reported the consumer price index hit its highest in nearly two years at 0.7% growth in November from a year ago.

The IMF said Beijing's transition to a more consumption-led growth model ""requires more urgent and forceful"" stimulus.

Chinese leaders in October announced development goals for the next five years would include greater efforts to boost consumption in addition to tech self-sufficiency. Top leaders are expected to hold an annual meeting later this week to discuss economic plans for next year.

The IMF representatives were speaking at the end of a 10-day visit of Beijing and Shanghai for the fund's annual China economy review, known as the Article IV Consultation.

Georgieva joined the discussions with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Vice Premier He Lifeng, People's Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng, Minister of Finance Lan Fo'an and Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao. 

Li met with Georgieva and the heads of nine other major international economic organizations on Tuesday in Beijing. The Chinese premier called for more cooperation and said China would be able to achieve its economic targets for this year, according to  

Sonali Jain-Chandra, Mission Chief for China, led the visit. IMF First Deputy Managing Director Dan Katz joined part of the mission and met senior Chinese officials.

On Wednesday stateside, the U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower its benchmark interest rates by a quarter percentage point to a range of 3.5%-3.75%.

However, given that traders are all but certain that the cut will happen — an 87.6% chance, to be exact, according to the CME FedWatch tool — the news is likely already priced into stocks by the market. 

That means any whiff of restraint could weigh on equities. In fact, the talk in the markets is that the Fed might deliver a ""hawkish cut"": lower rates while suggesting it could be a while before it cuts again.

The ""dot plot,"" or a projection of where Fed officials think interest rates will end up over the next few years, will be the clearest signal of any hawkishness. Investors will also parse Chair Jerome Powell's press conference and central bankers' estimates for U.S. economic growth and inflation to gauge the Fed's future rate path.

In other words, the Fed could rein in market sentiment even if it cuts rates. Perhaps end-of-year festivities might be muted this year.

U.S. stocks were mixed Tuesday. The S&P 500 remained largely unchanged and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.38%, but the Nasdaq Composite added 0.13%. The Russell 2000 hit an intraday high. Asia-Pacific markets mostly fell Wednesday.

India's AI space attracts billions from Big Tech. Microsoft on Tuesday said it would invest $17.5 billion in India's cloud and artificial intelligence sector across four years, while Amazon on Wednesday pledged to invest over $35 billion by 2030 in the same area.

China's consumer prices clock quickest rise in nearly two years. The country's consumer inflation for November climbed 0.7% from a year earlier, as expected by a Reuters poll. However, the producer price index dropped 2.2% on an annual basis, steeper than the estimated 2% fall.

Indonesia-U.S. trade deal is on rocky ground. Jakarta is reluctant to agree to some conditions in the deal, The Financial Times reported Tuesday. U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer believes Indonesia is ""backtracking"" on its commitments, people familiar with the matter told FT.

[PRO] Will China sales lift Nvidia stock? While market reaction to news that U.S. President Donald Trump has allowed the chipmaker to sell more advanced chips to Beijing was muted, analysts are more optimistic about the development.

U.S.-China AI talent race heats up

When it comes to brain power, ""America's edge is deteriorating dangerously,"" Chris Miller, author of the book ""Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology,"" told a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee last week. It's a lead that's ""fragile and much smaller"" than its advantage in AI chips, he said.

Part of the difference comes from the sheer scale, especially as education levels rise in China. Its population is four times that of the U.S., and the same goes for the volume of science, technology, engineering and mathematics graduates. In 2020, China produced 3.57 million STEM graduates, the most of any country, and far outpacing the 820,000 in the U.S.

While it's been clear to Europe for some time that U.S. President Donald Trump is not the biggest fan of the region, the president's latest tirade against the continent's leadership will sting — particularly as the bloc strives to show more decisiveness and authority.

Trump has once again provoked outrage among his European allies, describing them as ""weak"" and leading a ""decaying"" region in an interview with Politico published Tuesday. Criticizing the region's response to immigration and the war in Ukraine, Trump said: ""I think they don't know what to do.""

That comment will be jarring for Europe after its efforts in recent days, weeks and months to support Ukraine, be it militarily, diplomatically or financially — efforts which Trump has frequently downplayed.

Instead, Europe has had to watch on as U.S. officials have held talks with their Russian and Ukrainian counterparts on a draft peace plan for Ukraine, without a seat at the table. That's despite the fact that the resolution of the almost four-year war — and what shape that takes — is seen by analysts, and European leaders, as critical for the region's future security.

Indeed, Trump's comments came just a day after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in London to meet European leaders to discuss joint efforts to end the war. The leaders stressed the need for security guarantees for Ukraine in any peace deal, and expressed their opposition to Ukraine having to cede territory to Russia as part of an agreement, as has been demanded by Russia. 

Trump has vacillated on the issue, previously suggesting Ukraine would have to give up land and then suggesting Kyiv could win back lost territory.

European leaders this week also discussed the thorny issue of future funding for the country, which is a bugbear for Trump. The leaders said ""positive progress"" had been made on using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine's post-war reconstruction, although such a move faces hurdles and opposition from some countries in the EU.

Trump appeared unmoved by Europe's diplomatic efforts, of late. When Politico asked him whether Europe could help end the war, he said: ""They talk but they don't produce. And the war just keeps going on and on.""

There's no doubt that Trump has a checkered relationship with Europe and its leaders, appearing to get on well with some — such as the U.K. and Italy's Prime Ministers Keir Starmer and Giorgia Meloni, and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte— but not so much with others.

Trump has had something of an awkward ""frenemy"" relationship with French President Emmanuel Macron who he has both praised and criticized, and he has no natural rapport with the serious German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Trump also appears to have a strained relationship with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Belittling his political foes is nothing new for Trump, but what's shocking for Europe is that he appears willing to relinquish longstanding friends and tested alliances that have been in place since World War II. 

Europe was already put on notice last week when Trump's new national security strategy stated that Europe risked ""civilizational erasure"" within the next 20 years and questioned whether European countries can ""remain reliable allies."" In turn, it said Washington should reestablish strategic stability with Russia. The Kremlin praised the new strategy, saying it largely accorded with Russia's ""vision.""

The security strategy signals a seismic shift in U.S.-European relations, analysts say, and should be a wake-up call for Europe.

""Trump's worldview is clear"" in the new U.S. national security document, Ian Bremmer, founder and president of Eurasia Group, commented Tuesday: 

""A strong united Europe is a threat, not an asset. The Kremlin calls the document ""aligned"" with Russian interests. That should make every NATO capital sit up straight,"" he said in comments on social media platform X.

Bremmer said the transatlantic relationship had been the world's strongest up to this point, but that had changed under the Trump administration.

""President Trump believes a strong Europe is not in the U.S.' interests, particularly a strong, coordinated Europe. He does not like the European Union ... His issue is that the EU, together, has the ability to tell Trump things that he doesn't like to hear,"" Bremmer added.

Governments worldwide are watching.","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/10/australia-16-year-old-teens-ban-social-media-policy-law-ig-tiktok-fb-reddit-youtube-snapchat.html","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 10:13:22 GMT","



In this article

Australia on Wednesday became the first country to formally bar users under the age of 16 from accessing major social media platforms, a move expected to be closely monitored by global tech companies and policymakers around the world.

Canberra's ban, which came into effect from midnight local time, targets 10 major services, including Alphabet's YouTube, Meta's Instagram, ByteDance's TikTok, Reddit, Snapchat and Elon Musk's X.

The controversial rule requires these platforms to take ""reasonable steps"" to prevent underage access, using age-verification methods such as inference from online activity, facial estimation via selfies, uploaded IDs, or linked bank details.

All targeted platforms had agreed to comply with the policy to some extent. Elon Musk's X had been one of the last holdouts, but signaled on Wednesday that it would comply. 

The policy means millions of Australian children are expected to have lost access to their social accounts. 

However, the impact of the policy could be even wider, as it will set a benchmark for other governments considering teen social media bans, including Denmark, Norway, France, Spain, Malaysia and New Zealand. 

CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning.

Ahead of the legislation's passage last year, a YouGov survey found that 77% of Australians backed the under-16 social media ban. Still, the rollout has faced some resistance since becoming law.

Supporters of the bill have argued it safeguards children from social media-linked harms, including cyberbullying, mental health issues, and exposure to predators and pornography. 

Among those welcoming the official ban on Wednesday was Jonathan Haidt, social psychologist and author of The Anxious Generation, a 2024 best-selling book that linked a growing mental health crisis to smartphone and social media usage, especially for the young.

In a post on social media platform X, Haidt commended policymakers in Australia for ""freeing kids under 16 from the social media trap.""

""There will surely be difficulties in the early months, but the world is rooting for your success, and many other nations will follow,"" he added. 

On the other hand, opponents contend that the ban infringes on freedoms of expression and access to information, raises privacy concerns through invasive age verification, and represents excessive government intervention that undermines parental responsibility.

Those critics include groups like Amnesty Tech, which said in a statement Tuesday that the ban was an ineffective fix that ignored the rights and realities of younger generations.

""The most effective way to protect children and young people online is by protecting all social media users through better regulation, stronger data protection laws and better platform design,"" said Amnesty Tech Programme Director Damini Satija.

Meanwhile, David Inserra, a fellow for free expression and technology at the Cato Institute, warned in a blog post that children would evade the new policy by shifting to new platforms, private apps like Telegram, or VPNs, driving them to ""more isolated communities and platforms with fewer protections"" where monitoring is harder.

Tech companies like Google have also warned that the policy could be extremely difficult to enforce, while government-commissioned reports have pointed to inaccuracies in age-verification technology, such as selfie-based age-guessing software. 

Indeed, on Wednesday, local reports in Australia indicated that many children had already bypassed the ban, with age-assurance tools misclassifying users, and workarounds such as VPNs proving effective. 

However, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had attempted to preempt these issues, acknowledging in an opinion piece on Sunday that the system would not work flawlessly from the start, likening it to liquor laws.

""The fact that teenagers occasionally find a way to have a drink doesn't diminish the value of having a clear national standard,"" he added.

Experts told CNBC that the rollout is expected to continue to face challenges and that regulators would need to take a trial-and-error approach. 

""There's a fair amount of teething problems around it. Many young people have been posting on TikTok that they successfully evaded the age limitations and that's to be expected,"" said Terry Flew, a professor of digital communication and culture at the University of Sydney. 

""You were never going to get 100% disappearance of every person under the age of 16 from every one of the designated platforms on day one,"" he added.

Experts told CNBC that the policy rollout in Australia will be closely watched by tech firms and lawmakers worldwide, as other countries consider their own moves to ban or restrict teen social media usage. 

""Governments are responding to how public expectations have changed about the internet and social media, and the companies have not been particularly responsive to moral suasion,"" said Flew. 

""We see similar pressures are emerging, particularly, but not exclusively in Europe,"" he added.  

The European Parliament passed a non-binding resolution in November advocating a minimum age of 16 for social media access, allowing parental consent for 13 to 15-year-olds. 

The bloc has also proposed banning addictive features such as infinite scrolling and auto-play for minors, which could lead to EU-wide enforcement against non-compliant platforms.

Outside Europe, Malaysia and New Zealand have also been advancing proposals to ban social media for children under 16. 

However, laws elsewhere are expected to differ from Australia's, whether that be regarding age restrictions or age verification processes. 

""My hope is that countries that are looking at implementing similar policies will monitor for what doesn't work in Australia and learn from our mistakes,"" said Tama Leaver, professor at the Department of Internet Studies at Curtin University and a Chief Investigator in the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Digital Child. 

""I think platforms and tech companies are also starting to realize that if they don't want age-gating policies everywhere, they're going to have to do much better at providing safer, appropriate experiences for young users.""

The CEO of South Korean online retail giant Coupang Corp. resigned Wednesday, three weeks after the company became aware of a massive data breach that affected nearly 34 million customers.

Coupang said CEO Park Dae-jun resigned due to the data breach incident — which was revealed on Nov. 18 —  according to a Google translation of the statement in Korean.

""I am deeply sorry for disappointing the public with the recent personal information incident,"" Park said, adding, ""I feel a deep sense of responsibility for the outbreak and the subsequent recovery process, and I have decided to step down from all positions.""

Following his resignation, parent company Coupang Inc. appointed Harold Rogers, the Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel, as interim CEO. 

Coupang said that Rogers plans to ""focus on alleviating customer anxiety caused by the personal information leak"" and to stabilize the organisation. 

Park, who joined the company in 2012, became Coupang's sole CEO in May, after the company transitioned away from a dual-CEO system.

According to Coupang, he was responsible for the company's innovative new business and regional infrastructure development, and led projects to expand sales channels for small and medium enterprises, among others. 

South Korean companies are known for being ""very, very cost-efficient,"" which may have led to neglecting areas like cybersecurity, Peter Kim, managing director at KB Securities, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" Wednesday.

""I think the core issue here is that we've had a number of other breaches, not just Coupang, but previously, telecom companies in Korea,"" Kim added. ""I understand some data companies consider Korea to be [the] top three or four most breached on a data, on an IT security basis in the world.""

South Korean companies have been hit by cybersecurity breaches before, including an April incident at mobile carrier SK Telecom that affected 23.24 million people. The country previously saw one of its largest cybersecurity incidents in 2011, when attackers stole over 35 million user details from internet platforms Nate and Cyworld.

Nate is one of the most popular search engines in South Korea, while Cyworld was one of the country's largest social networking sites in the early 2000s. 

Prime Minister Kim Min-seok reportedly said Wednesday that strict action would be taken against the company if violations of the law were found, according to South Korean media outlet Yonhap. 

Police also raided the Coupang headquarters for a second day on Wednesday, continuing their investigation into the data breach. 

Yonhap also reported, citing sources, that the police search warrant ""specifies a Chinese national who formerly worked for Coupang as a suspect on charges of breaching the information and communications network and leaking confidential data.""

Last week, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung called for increased penalties on data breaches, saying that the Coupang data breach had served as a wake-up call.

Monday - Friday, 10:00 - 11:00 SIN/HK  |  0400 - 05:00 CET

This report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. You can subscribe here.

Chris Miller, author of the book ""Chip War,"" warned three years ago that the balance of modern power hinges on a semiconductor supply chain crossing geopolitical fault lines. Now, the Tufts University historian is raising a new concern: the U.S. risks losing its advantage over China in artificial intelligence talent.

When it comes to brain power, ""America's edge is deteriorating dangerously,"" Miller told a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee last week. It's a lead that's ""fragile and much smaller"" than its advantage in AI chips, he said. 

Carnegie Endowment researchers echoed those concerns a day later, noting China has been producing more top-tier AI researchers over the last few years, while fewer are heading to the U.S.

Part of the difference comes from sheer scale, especially as education levels rise in China.

Its population is quadruple that of the U.S., and the same goes for the volume of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) graduates. In 2020, China produced 3.57 million STEM graduates, the most of any country, and far outpacing the 820,000 in the U.S.

The growth of China's higher education graduates has been dramatic, increasing ninefold in just one generation. The share of adults with at least a master's degree rose from just 0.1% at the turn of the century to nearly 0.9% two decades later.

The U.S., starting from a much higher base, has seen the same ratio climb far more steadily from 8.7% to 14.1% during that time.

The surge is reshaping companies' pipelines. Most of Xpeng's new hires are fresh graduates, CEO He Xiaopeng told reporters last month.

He claimed that despite a relatively small pool of AI talent in both the U.S. and China, the electric vehicle manufacturer was able to recruit 10 specialists in driver-assist technology this year.

The company's former vice president of autonomous driving now heads Nvidia's automotive department.

Beijing is engineering more of this momentum as it seeks tech self-sufficiency. The Ministry of Education said in August that one-fifth of higher education programs nationwide have been revamped in the last two years — with a slew of majors cut or added — to channel more students into AI and integrated circuits fields.

It's not necessarily that China is much better at attracting global AI talent, but the ability to keep more AI experts at home ""could have a major impact on talent flows,"" Tufts University's Miller pointed out to me in an email. 

Meanwhile, U.S. immigration rules could make it difficult for AI researchers to work in the U.S., he said.

There's still debate over whether volume can consistently create value. 

U.S.-based OpenAI triggered the generative AI craze in 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT-3.5, and other U.S. companies, such as Anthropic, have released models that are considered global benchmarks.

China's DeepSeek only made similar waves early this year with its claim to have beaten OpenAI at only a fraction of the cost. Google raised the bar further last month with its Gemini 3 model. 

The U.S. AI models are officially unavailable in China, while Washington restricts exports of Nvidia's most advanced chips.

Despite the restrictions, Chinese companies have increasingly found ways to use scale — whether in engineers, less advanced chips or data — to gradually build domestic AI capabilities. That's apparent in how Chinese AI models rival OpenAI at a fraction of the cost.

Developers in China are also doing more with less.

Chinese internet leaders spent about 400 billion yuan ($56.58 billion) in capital expenditure this year — about one-tenth of their U.S. peers, while achieving ""comparable"" AI model performance, Wei Xiong, China internet analyst at UBS Securities, said in a report last week. 

And while analysts sometimes warn of ""circular financing"" in the U.S. AI industry — buoyed by investor money that circulates within the same funding ecosystem rather than genuine commercial revenue — China's leading developers, by contrast, are drawing primarily on internal cash flow.

Data abundance is another advantage. The popularity of short videos in China has given local companies a hoard of training material. Aside from two models from Google, the rest of the world's top 15 image-to-video AI generation models came from Chinese companies, according to AI benchmarking firm Artificial Analysis.

Chinese companies have also posted the fastest growth in U.S. patent grants last year, with telecom giant Huawei ranking fifth overall among commercial firms.

The company's global patent licensing revenue hit a record $630 million last year, with further growth expected in 2025, according to Huawei Vice President Alan Fan, who heads the company's intellectual property rights department. He said clients are increasingly seeking not only 5G and WiFi-related patents but also audio and visual technologies. 

Back home, Huawei is also partnering with universities for AI-related research and training.

All these efforts add to a growing trend.

China has ranked first in a U.S. index measuring student performance in STEM-related Olympiad competitions for several years. China's scientific research contributions, as tracked by the publisher of the scientific journal Nature, surpassed the U.S. in 2023 — and quadrupled that lead the following year.

Yet talent still flows both ways. Many Chinese founders are still moving to Silicon Valley to launch startups, Lu Zhang, founder and managing partner of the locally based Fusion Fund, told me. She pointed to the benefits of operating within ""one of the best enterprise ecosystems.""

Her bigger worry for the industry is insufficient electrical power, especially in the U.S. ""I think before we run out of GPU we're going to run out of energy,"" she said.

And energy is where analysts increasingly say China has the upper hand.

In the trinity of factors that Miller identified in his Senate testimony for maintaining AI leadership —computing power, brain power, and electrical power — human capital isn't his only worry. ""America has a substantial lead in computing power, [but] China leads in electrical power.""

Kevin Liu, chief offshore China and overseas strategist at CICC, said there is still a way to go before AI demand, investments, and valuations reach the levels seen at the peak of the dotcom-era bubble.

Eswar Prasad, professor at Cornell University and former head of IMF's China division, sees ""no clear opportunity"" for the U.S. and China to increase direct trade.

Paul Triolo, Partner at DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group, discussed U.S. chip policy and the prospect of the SAFE CHIPS Act becoming law amid intense chip competition with China.

Nvidia chips approved for China. U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday that Nvidia's more advanced H200 AI chips have the green light for sale in China — if the U.S. gets a 25% cut.

U.S.-China talks. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng spoke Friday with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer about implementing the ""Busan arrangement."" 

Uproar over ByteDance's AI phone. Days after TikTok's parent company launched its AI assistant on a ZTE smartphone, developers moved to address complaints that the device could not access WeChat and several banking apps.

China is catching up rapidly [in AI] with the chips, with the applications. If we look at the number from the top down, macro perspective, China is not lagging that much behind with U.S. For example, the total amount of investment regarding technology [by China] is 70% of U.S. has been doing.

— Kevin Liu, Equity Strategist at CICC

Chinese markets fell Wednesday as investors parsed the latest inflation print. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slipped 0.56%, and the mainland CSI 300 declined 0.78% after China's consumer prices rose 0.7% from a year earlier, its highest level since February last year. 

Both benchmarks are set to break a two-week winning streak. The Hang Seng Index has dropped over 2% since Monday, while the CSI 300 is down 0.5% over the same period. For the year to date, the Hang Seng is up over 26%, while the CSI 300 has gained more than 15%.

The offshore yuan last traded at 7.0605 against the dollar, its strongest level since October 2024.

The trade deal between Indonesia and the U.S. is at risk of unravelling as Washington officials view that Jakarta is going back on the terms of the agreement, according to The Financial Times. 

The report, citing people familiar with matter, said on Tuesday that U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer believes Indonesia was ""backtracking"" on several commitments it had made.

Indonesian officials reportedly are averse to agreeing to some binding commitments made in the deal and have communicated that to the USTR. 

Washington believes Indonesia is ""backsliding"" on removing non-tariff barriers to U.S. industrial and agricultural exports as well as its pledges on taking action on digital trade issues. 

Reuters reported on Wednesday that an Indonesian official told the agency that tariff negotiations were ongoing, with no specific issues have arisen during the talks.

U.S. President Donald Trump U.S. had announced a deal with Indonesia in mid-July, slashing so-called ""reciprocal"" tariff rate on the Southeast Asian country to 19% from the 32% he had threatened in his ""tariff letter"" to the country earlier that month. 

Trump had said that Indonesia had ""committed"" to purchasing $15 billion of U.S. Energy, $4.5 billion in American agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets as part of the deal.

The U.S. president also said at the time that ""U.S. Exports to Indonesia are to be Tariff and Non Tariff Barrier FREE.""

The USTR and Indonesia's trade ministry did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comments. 

A person familiar with the matter told the FT that Indonesia was ""outright saying they cannot implement what they agreed to and need to renegotiate the initial commitments to be nonbinding,"" adding that the stance was ""extremely problematic and is not being well-received from the United States. Indonesia may be at risk of losing its deal.""

This is not the first time that Washington and Jakarta are seeing some friction over a trade deal. In November, the FT reported that Indonesia had rejected a ""poison pill"" clause in its deal that other Southeast Asian economies such as Malaysia had agreed.

The ""poison pill"" clause threatens to revoke a trade agreement if the country signs any rival deal that the U.S. considers will compromise its key interests. 

Trump's trade deals with Asian countries have seen other economies in the region also push back, after these initial agreements were announced. 

For example, Trump had said that South Korea would invest $350 billion in the country, but Seoul said that it could not simply hand over the amount in cash. South Korea eventually committed to investing $200 billion in cash over 10 years and a $150 billion fund to be spent on investments in shipbuilding.

Trump had also announced that Japan would invest $550 billion in the country, with the U.S. taking 90% of the profit from these investments. However, Tokyo later said that the profits would be split between Japan and the U.S., according to the degree of contributions by each side.

Amazon on Wednesday committed to investing over $35 billion in India's cloud and artificial intelligence space by 2030, as hyperscalers race to get a foothold in the market. 

The commitment, unveiled at the Amazon Smbhav Summit in New Delhi, builds on nearly $40 billion already invested in the country. 

In a press release, Amazon said the new funds will target AI-driven digitization, export growth and job creation, aligning with India's national priorities to build up its local AI environment.

By 2030, Amazon said the plan is expected to generate an additional 1 million direct, indirect, induced and seasonal jobs in India, quadruple exports to $80 billion and deliver AI benefits to 15 million small businesses.

India is one of the fastest‑growing regions for AI spending within Asia Pacific, Deepika Giri, IDC's regional head of research for big data & AI, told CNBC.

""A major gap, and therefore a significant opportunity, lies in the shortage of suitable compute infrastructure for running AI models,"" Giri said.

She added that countries across Asia are accelerating efforts to build sovereign AI capabilities as the technology becomes more regionalized due to trade tensions and tariffs, with infrastructure as a central pillar of those strategies.

The investment highlights Amazon's bet on India's booming digital economy, where it has been building fulfillment centers, as well as data centers and payments infrastructure under its Amazon Web Services subsidiary. 

It also comes soon after Microsoft announced plans to invest $17.5 billion in India's AI infrastructure as Big Tech players accelerate their push into the market. 

""We are humbled to have been a part of India's digital transformation journey over the past 15 years,"" said Amit Agarwal, senior vice president for emerging markets at Amazon. 

""Looking ahead, we're excited to continue being a catalyst for India's growth, as we democratize access to AI for millions of Indians.""

On Wednesday stateside, the U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower its benchmark interest rates by a quarter percentage point to a range of 3.5%-3.75%.

However, given that traders are all but certain that the cut will happen — an 88.6% chance, to be exact, according to the CME FedWatch tool — the news is likely already priced into stocks by the market. 

That means any whiff of restraint could weigh on equities. In fact, the talk in the markets is that the Fed might deliver a ""hawkish cut"": lower rates while suggesting it could be a while before it cuts again.

The ""dot plot,"" or a projection of where Fed officials think interest rates will end up over the next few years, will be the clearest signal of any hawkishness. Investors will also parse Chair Jerome Powell's press conference and central bankers' estimates for U.S. economic growth and inflation to gauge the Fed's future rate path.

In other words, the Fed could rein in market sentiment even if it cuts rates. Perhaps end-of-year festivities might be muted this year.

U.S. stocks were mixed Tuesday. The S&P 500 remained largely unchanged and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.38%, but the Nasdaq Composite added 0.13%. The Russell 2000 hit an intraday high. Over in Europe, the regional Stoxx 600 ended flat. 

The Fed is expected to cut rates on Wednesday. But the decision might not be unanimous, implying that further easing could be put on a pause. Fed officials will also update their ""dot plot,"" showcasing interest rate expectations.

Vietnam's stock market has been surging. The VanEck Vietnam ETF (VNM) has soared roughly 62% year to date, thanks to domestic reforms and trade developments. And the country could continue its upward trajectory, analysts say.

U.S. changes timeline for China's purchases of soybeans. Following an NBC News report that soybean purchases by China are far from reaching the 12 million metric tons target by the end of the year, Greer said the finish line was the end of the ""growing season.""

[PRO] Will China sales lift Nvidia stock? While market reaction to news that U.S. President Donald Trump has allowed the chipmaker to sell more advanced chips to Beijing was muted, analysts are more optimistic about the development.

Nvidia can sell the more advanced H200 AI chip to China — but will Beijing want them?

The H200 is one of Nvidia's most advanced chips for training and running AI, but China has been on a drive to wean itself off American technology and boost local semiconductor development.

But while China held off on H20 purchases, the H200 is far more advanced than its predecessor, which could tempt Beijing. Meanwhile, Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu said there were supply shortages across the entire semiconductor supply chain.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday claimed to have ""just heard"" that all four of former President Joe Biden's appointments to the Federal Reserve were approved by ""autopen,"" suggesting they are not authorized to serve in those roles.

Trump provided no evidence for the claim, which piggybacks on his repeated assertion that all of his predecessor's documents that were signed using an autopen are invalid.

But he said he thinks it is ""something we have to look into."" And the president suggested that the list of autopen-signed appointees could include Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has faced near-constant criticism from Trump over his handling of the central bank and U.S. interest rate levels.

Trump's comments came on the eve of a meeting by the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates. 

After reentering the White House for his second term in January, Trump for months had repeatedly pressed Powell and the Fed, without success, to cut interest rates, and lambasted them when they failed to do his bidding.

The FOMC in September made its first rate cut of Trump's current term, and then cut them again in October. The FOMC is expected to reduce rates for a third time on Wednesday. 

Trump, in his first term, appointed Powell as Fed chair. Biden reappointed Powell in 2021. The chairman's term is set to expire in May.

Three other current members of the Fed's Board of Governors — Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Michael Barr,  Lisa Cook — are Biden appointees. With Powell, they comprise a majority of the Fed's board.

The autopen comments came during a campaign-style speech in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, where Trump had traveled to speak about the economy and counter Democrats' messaging about an affordability crisis in the U.S.

""By the way, it looks — you're gonna have to check this, please — I just heard, it could be that all four commissioners in the Fed signed by Biden ... I hear that the autopen may have signed those commissions,"" Trump said.

Trump interspersed his accusation with criticism for Powell, derisively calling him ""Too Late"" and claiming JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon had urged the central bank chief to lower rates.

""But I hear that the autopen may have signed those commissions. If they signed those commissions — now maybe I'm wrong, but we're going to check,"" Trump said.

He then appeared to address a member of his administration, asking, ""Have you checked that? Are you hearing it? Who signed it? Did he sign it, or did the autopen sign it?""

""So, I don't know. I think it's something we have to look into,"" Trump said. ""They put people there that are not authorized to be there.""

Trump then said, ""Would you check that, Scott?"" appearing to refer to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

""Because I'm hearing that the autopen could have signed maybe all four, but maybe a couple of them,"" Trump said.

""We'll take two,"" he added.

Monday - Friday, 6:00 - 7:00 PM ET

In a Tuesday interview with CNBC's Jim Cramer, Marvell Technology CEO Matt Murphy dismissed reports suggesting his company lost business from high-profile customers.

""I can tell you this, from Tuesday to Friday, nothing changed,"" Murphy said, referring to two reports that cropped up days after its earnings report. ""We didn't lose any business."" 

The semiconductor company beat the estimates last Tuesday and indicated demand for data center products will be strong over the next year. Marvell also announced plans to buy Celestial AI. The deal is worth at least $3.35 billion, and it could help Marvell scale its chip business. The quarter largely impressed Wall Street, and shares climbed over the next few days.

But the stock gave back its gains this week after reports that Marvell had lost business from two hyperscalers engaged in massive data center buildout: Amazon and Microsoft. Marvel stock finished Tuesday down 3.37%. 

Marvell has ""deep, key relationships with all the major U.S. hyperscalers,"" according to Murphy. He stressed that the company's business in the data center is ""rock solid,"" reiterating the positive outlook shared in the quarter.

""The silver lining is there's a massive opportunity right now to buy Marvell,"" Murphy told Cramer. ""If you just look at where we trade today relative just to the semiconductor index, we're trading below the average multiple. We are not an average company.""

Oops, something went wrong

Shares in the highly anticipated Bitcoin treasury firm Twenty One Capital plummeted 20% on its listing debut on Tuesday.

Jack Mallers, the plucky Bitcoin evangelist running the venture, vowed in April to best the sector's biggest Bitcoin buyers, including Michael Saylor's Strategy and Wall Street titan BlackRock.

Tuesday's double-digit crash on the New York Stock Exchange has since dampened the excitement.

The problem?

Once invincible, Bitcoin treasury firms such as Twenty One have faced increasing pressure in recent months as cryptocurrencies plummet in value.

Since Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $126,080 in October, it has fallen by some 27%, dragged by macroeconomic factors and market anxiety over the US Federal Reserve's lack of interest rate cuts.

Now, companies that raised capital to buy Bitcoin over $100,000 — thinking the asset would never drop below six-figures — are sitting on massive unrealised losses while their equity premiums have simultaneously evaporated.

Metaplanet, a Japanese hotel operator turned Bitcoin treasury firm, has swung from over $600 million in unrealised profits in early October to around $530 million in unrealised losses as of December 1, per Galaxy Research data.

Other firms with substantial Bitcoin positions, such as Trump Media and Technology Group, GD Culture Group, and Empery Digital, are also staring down tens of millions of dollars in unrealised losses as their share prices plummet.

Twenty One's trading debut makes it the third-largest Bitcoin treasury firm behind Saylor's Strategy and MARA Holdings, a Bitcoin mining firm.

The firm owns around 43,500 Bitcoin worth just over $4 billion. Yet its shares trade at a $3.85 billion market capitalisation.

Such discounts often signal market pessimism, underperformance, or a lack of investor confidence in the firm's strategy or management.

Still, Twenty One is well-connected in both the crypto industry and the broader financial sector.

The firm was formed through a merger with Cantor Equity, a special purpose acquisition company backed by Cantor Fitzgerald, an investment banking and brokerage firm chaired by Brandon Lutnick, the son of US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick.

Tether, the firm behind USDT, the largest stablecoin with over $185 billion in circulation, owns more than 50% of the venture, while SoftBank Group, one of the world's biggest investment holding companies, also owns a significant minority stake.

Mallers, too, is well-known in the industry for his Bitcoin fervour.

The 31-year-old has been tinkering with Bitcoin since at least 2016. Before taking on the role of CEO at Twenty One, he founded Zap, the parent company of Strike, an app which lets users send and receive payments over Bitcoin's Lightning Network.

Yet his brash, unapologetic attitude has also divided opinions.

“I don't give a fuck that you're rich or popular,” Mallers said in a 2021 spat with Elon Musk over Tesla's Bitcoin holdings.

“You clearly know nothing about Bitcoin or you're more egotistic than we all thought.”

Sentiment across the market shows a mild improvement today, with the Fear and Greed Index rising to 30 after spending much of the past two weeks in the lower twenties and briefly touching extreme fear levels that had pushed many participants into defensive positioning.

Bitcoin is trading near $92,000 after a stretch of uneven activity that began in late November, and the steadier tone around the largest asset has created a backdrop in which a small group of altcoins can advance without relying on abrupt, flow-driven bursts.

Bitcoin Price (Source: CoinMarketCap)

Ethereum sits at the center of that shift as its performance often sets expectations for how much risk the market is willing to take.

Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $3,330, up by about 7% over 24 hours, and the increase is supported by an improvement in both spot and derivatives participation, with deeper books and steadier bidding in ranges that had previously struggled to hold during last week's retreat.

Activity across major venues indicates that traders who had reduced exposure during the November drawdown are gradually re-entering positions, not because sentiment has shifted dramatically, but because the asset's day-to-day usage and continued demand for block space provide a degree of stability even when the wider environment remains cautious.

This pattern allows Ethereum to function as an early gauge of whether the current relief has staying power, since its liquidity and scale often give it the ability to recover before smaller assets regain enough confidence to follow.

Monero (XMR) is trading near $404, up by roughly 12% in 24 hours, and the climb aligns with periods in which privacy-oriented tokens receive renewed attention from communities that maintain consistent usage regardless of broader sentiment shifts.

Depth across several exchanges shows more orderly conditions than last week, with a distribution of bids that implies steady interest rather than isolated buying, which is notable because privacy assets often strengthen when markets search for tokens with established user bases and reliability rather than speculative catalysts.

Mantle (MNT) is trading near $1.20, up by about 7% in 24 hours, supported by consistent throughput and engagement across the Layer 2 ecosystem that underpins its value.

The token has climbed back above ranges that came under pressure during last week's downturn, and turnover now sits noticeably higher than the levels seen during the most severe portion of the recent selloff.

This behavior aligns with the tendency for infrastructure and scaling tokens to recover earlier than many smaller assets when sentiment begins to ease, because they rely on live activity and measurable network growth rather than short-term narrative swings.

The rise in the market sentiment and today's scattered gains among Ethereum, Monero, and Mantle demonstrate that the market is willing to experiment with selective positioning, yet the structure of flows suggests that a broad altcoin season remains distant.

Bitcoin continues to anchor sentiment near $92,000, and most major tokens remain confined to narrow ranges while participants wait for clearer macro signals, steadier global liquidity conditions, and confirmation that the recent improvement does not fade with the next shift in funding or equities.

For now, the recovery resembles the early-stage attempt to stabilize rather than the altcoin season ready for wide rotation, although the presence of consistent activity in a few established networks shows that the market has not fully retreated from altcoin exposure even as caution remains the prevailing influence.

The chart finally shows a market that has stopped bleeding and begun to fight back, and Ethereum is about to enter a structurally critical phase. ETH has successfully reversed from the $2,700-$2,800 range after months of cascading sell pressure, printing a series of higher lows and pushing hard toward the cluster of moving averages overhead. At a time when Ethereum's fundamentals and whale behavior are aligning in a way the market has not seen in months, this is precisely the type of behavior that precedes significant trend shifts.

Ethereum's biggest battle 

As a result of the rally, ETH has now reached its most significant ceiling, the 50-day EMA. This indicator has historically served as a turning point between breakout-driven momentum and midterm bearish continuation. In addition to being the level most likely to cause a degradation of the short-term rally, the price is currently pushing directly into it with convincing force.ETHUSDT Chart by TradingView"">

Here, sellers who made it through the most recent reversal will be defending hard, and markets seldom break through a technical barrier like this without at least some hesitation. However, the resistance might prove to be short-lived not due to retail zeal, but rather to whale accumulation that keeps getting stronger below the surface. 

ETH has landed

The decline in volumes that leaves little opportunity for misunderstanding has been purchased by large accounts. Tens of thousands of ETH are now loaded onto addresses with histories of realized profits totaling millions of dollars. They are aiming for a structural repricing rather than a dead-cat bounce.

This accumulation base serves as a liquidity anchor as well as a vote of confidence. Any short-term decline is more likely to find solid support than to cause a complete retrace if whales are prepared to buy heavily into the 50 EMA. A long-awaited break in the pattern of lower highs and lower lows has already occurred in the market in the form of a massive momentum pivot.

The market structure is pointing upward, volume is increasing, price strength is returning and whales are building significant exposure, so $5,000 is no longer a fantasy target but rather a real technical trajectory. Although the game-changing move by Ethereum has not yet been confirmed, the setup is at last moving in the right direction.

The Holiday Season is near its peak as Christmas is about two weeks away, and naturally, this bullish moment will likely drive crypto assets' value higher. Many crypto tokens are also nearing their peak and could reach it in this duration.

In line with the same, BeInCrypto has analysed three such altcoins which could hit new all-time highs before Christmas 2025.

RAIN is trading at $0.0075, sitting 14.3% below its all-time high of $0.0086. The token will likely need stronger support from the broader market to retest this peak, as recent momentum alone may not be sufficient to trigger a decisive breakout.

The Parabolic SAR indicates an active uptrend, signaling that bullish momentum is building. If RAIN can breach $0.0079 and flip it into support, it could accelerate buying interest and push the price toward its all-time high.

However, if investors take profits or market conditions weaken, RAIN could slip through the $0.0074 support. A breakdown below this level may send the price to $0.0068 or lower. This would invalidate the bullish thesis and stall recovery efforts.

UDS is trading at $2.54, positioned just below the $2.59 resistance level. The altcoin remains 35.6% below its all-time high of $3.44. This leaves considerable ground to cover before a full recovery can take shape.

The Ichimoku Cloud signals strengthening bullish momentum, suggesting the UDS could break above $2.59 soon. A successful move past this barrier may push the price to $2.73 and set up a climb toward the psychological $3.00 mark if broader market conditions remain supportive.

However, if bearish pressure returns, UDS could fall through the $2.48 support level. Losing this floor may send the altcoin toward $2.29, and a further drop to $2.12 would invalidate the bullish thesis and weaken recovery prospects.

XMR is trading at $397, holding above the $387 support while pushing toward the $417 resistance. The privacy token sits 18.4% below its all-time high of $471, leaving room for a potential upward move if market conditions strengthen.

The strongest catalyst for Monero is the sharp rise in capital inflows. The Chaikin Money Flow shows a steep uptick, signaling renewed investor confidence. This bullish shift could propel XMR past the $417 barrier and toward the $450 resistance. A breakout above that level may set up a full retest of the $471 ATH.

However, if momentum weakens or holders begin selling, XMR could slip below $387. Losing that support may trigger a decline toward $361 or lower. This would invalidate the bullish thesis and delay any attempt at reclaiming previous highs.

Sentiment across the market shows a mild improvement today, with the Fear and Greed Index rising to 30 after spending much of the past two weeks in the lower twenties and briefly touching extreme fear levels that had pushed many participants into defensive positioning.

Bitcoin is trading near $92,000 after a stretch of uneven activity that began in late November, and the steadier tone around the largest asset has created a backdrop in which a small group of altcoins can advance without relying on abrupt, flow-driven bursts.

Ethereum sits at the center of that shift as its performance often sets expectations for how much risk the market is willing to take.

Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $3,330, up by about 7% over 24 hours, and the increase is supported by an improvement in both spot and derivatives participation, with deeper books and steadier bidding in ranges that had previously struggled to hold during last week's retreat.

Activity across major venues indicates that traders who had reduced exposure during the November drawdown are gradually re-entering positions, not because sentiment has shifted dramatically, but because the asset's day-to-day usage and continued demand for block space provide a degree of stability even when the wider environment remains cautious.

This pattern allows Ethereum to function as an early gauge of whether the current relief has staying power, since its liquidity and scale often give it the ability to recover before smaller assets regain enough confidence to follow.

Monero (XMR) is trading near $404, up by roughly 12% in 24 hours, and the climb aligns with periods in which privacy-oriented tokens receive renewed attention from communities that maintain consistent usage regardless of broader sentiment shifts.

Depth across several exchanges shows more orderly conditions than last week, with a distribution of bids that implies steady interest rather than isolated buying, which is notable because privacy assets often strengthen when markets search for tokens with established user bases and reliability rather than speculative catalysts.

Mantle (MNT) is trading near $1.20, up by about 7% in 24 hours, supported by consistent throughput and engagement across the Layer 2 ecosystem that underpins its value.

The token has climbed back above ranges that came under pressure during last week's downturn, and turnover now sits noticeably higher than the levels seen during the most severe portion of the recent selloff.

This behavior aligns with the tendency for infrastructure and scaling tokens to recover earlier than many smaller assets when sentiment begins to ease, because they rely on live activity and measurable network growth rather than short-term narrative swings.

The rise in the market sentiment and today's scattered gains among Ethereum, Monero, and Mantle demonstrate that the market is willing to experiment with selective positioning, yet the structure of flows suggests that a broad altcoin season remains distant.

Bitcoin continues to anchor sentiment near $92,000, and most major tokens remain confined to narrow ranges while participants wait for clearer macro signals, steadier global liquidity conditions, and confirmation that the recent improvement does not fade with the next shift in funding or equities.

For now, the recovery resembles the early-stage attempt to stabilize rather than the altcoin season ready for wide rotation, although the presence of consistent activity in a few established networks shows that the market has not fully retreated from altcoin exposure even as caution remains the prevailing influence.

Cardano (ADA) was the best-performing altcoin in early morning trade on Wednesday, followed by Ethereum (ETH) among the major tokens, as traders watch for the Federal Reserve's rate cut decision later in the day.

Cardano's price rose 8.7% in the last 24 hours to $0.463. Leverage was cleared before the price stabilized at higher levels, according to Coinglass data, which shows concentrated long liquidations between $0.44 and $0.46.​

ADA is entering the FOMC window with less overhead pressure, as there were fewer liquidation bands above $0.48. Stocktwits retail sentiment for Cardano trended in the ‘bullish' zone over the past day. Chatter around the cryptocurrency remained at ‘high' levels. 

Ethereum (ETH) followed the bullish rally, climbing 6.4% in the last 24 hours to $3,319.41. The liquidation heatmap shows heavy long liquidations in two ranges around $3,350-$3,500 and $3,150-$3,250. These levels lost the most leverage in the last 24 hours.

An analyst on X noted that if Ethereum can move past the $3,300-$3,400 range, the next support level would be $3,700. This comes as Ethereum whales bought around $3.1 billion in ETH in the last three weeks, as per Santiment. On Stocktwits, the retail sentiment for Ethereum remained in the ‘bullish' territory over the past day, with ‘normal' levels of chatter. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) traded at $92,618, up 2.5% from the previous day. Data from Coinglass shows that many leveraged long positions were wiped out near $93,500-$94,500, where the price struggled to rise. On Stocktwits, retail sentiment continued to be in the ‘neutral' territory over the past day, with ‘low' levels of chatter. 

Solana (SOL) rose 5.2% to $139.25 in the last 24 hours. The liquidation heatmap shows heavy long wipes near the $145 range. For now, liquidation clusters around $135 remain active, indicating this is the primary support area within the current range.​ 

Dogecoin (DOGE) was up 4.7% to $0.1467. Binance Coin (BNB) was trading at $890.97, up 0.5% over the past day. BNB retail sentiment remained ‘bullish' with message volumes at ‘neutral' on Stocktwits.

For Ripple (XRP), there were dense long liquidations between $2.15 and $2.20, aligning with the intraday ceiling. XRP was trading at $2.08, up only 1% since Tuesday.

Retail traders are now eyeing Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, which could provide clues on the direction of the monetary policy for 2026. Speculation is heavy on potential new liquidity measures such as balance sheet expansion or a restart of quantitative easing, which often supports a Bitcoin rebound.

                                    From cross-border payments to tokenized deposits, the world's top banks are considering rebuilding how payments and liquidity move, settling in seconds and bringing programmability to instruments, markets and identity.                                

 Blockchain technology is starting to shift from crypto experiment to institutional infrastructure. Leading banks are building shared ledgers, tokenized money and programmable settlement rails to move value in real time—modernizing liquidity, reconciliation and trust across global payments, treasury and markets.

 Real-world deployment is now visible across key use cases: tokenized deposits for 24/7 liquidity; instant cross-border settlement; shared trade finance ledgers; tokenized assets; and compliance-built-in identity frameworks. These advances can compress settlement times, enhance transparency and create programmable financial flows.

 As banks move pilots into live environments, the core design question is public versus private networks. Institutions are considering hybrid models that balance scalability and control, while emerging standards and oversight will shape policy alignment and global interoperability.

Blockchain technology is beginning to move from a crypto-specific concept into a potential component of core banking infrastructure. Once the domain of startups, it is now part of how global institutions such as Citi, J.P. Morgan, Visa and others are exploring the future of payments and liquidity management. From tokenized deposits and programmable payments to the settlement of digital assets, the technology previously seen as a niche outlier is increasingly being considered as part of the operating system for modern finance.

As the landscape shifts from proof of concept to production, blockchain technology is becoming a part of the connective tissue linking payments, deposits and markets—one component of a shared digital architecture that brings new efficiency while preserving the trust on which global finance depends. This Tracker explores where programmable finance is finding real-world traction, what leading institutions are building today, and what these advances mean for treasury, operations and risk leaders alike. But before we dig into the details, here's a little background for nontechnical readers.

What it is: A blockchain is a shared database, designed to be tamper-resistant, that multiple parties can update. Think of it as a common ledger—kept in sync across institutions—where every entry is time-stamped, auditable and hard to alter retroactively. Permissioned blockchains limit access to vetted participants (banks, payment networks, corporates). Public blockchains are open to anyone. Both support tokens and coins, which are digital representations of money, claims or assets that can move and settle in near real time.

Why it matters: In banking, blockchains can potentially reduce manual reconciliations, shorten settlement windows and make money programmable. For treasurers and operations leaders, that could mean efficient liquidity management and the ability to commercially interact with underbanked regions. For risk and compliance teams, it could also mean greater traceability if designed accordingly.

How to read this: Below, we organize today's institutional blockchain activity around five use cases your teams are prioritizing: tokenized deposits; cross-border payments; shared ledgers for supply chains; liquidity for assets, including fixed holdings such as real estate; and security and identity. We also address some of the challenges inherent in choosing between public and private blockchain networks.






















Tokenized deposits are bank-issued digital representations of traditional deposits recorded on a blockchain. They're backed one-to-one by deposits, operate within existing regulatory frameworks and can be automated (for example, to sweep cash, release escrow or trigger conditional payouts). For corporate clients, they turn static balances into always-available working capital.

J.P. Morgan has extended JPM Coin—its permissioned platform that lets clients transfer dollar deposits on a private blockchain—and announced plans for a USD deposit token to settle transactions on Coinbase's Base network. Together, these initiatives give institutions compliant, round-the-clock access to liquidity. Citi is advancing a similar vision through Citi Token Services, which enables real-time movement of tokenized deposits within its network. Other institutions such as HSBC have also announced plans for tokenized deposits. In parallel, industry groups and consortia are exploring models such as the Regulated Liability Network (RLN) and participating in BIS-sponsored Project Agora—separate initiatives that aim to connect commercial-bank deposits, central-bank money and other regulated liabilities on shared ledgers to support instant settlement between trusted counterparties.

In fact, Citi's “Real Time: 24/7 Finance in an Always-On World” article points to a new baseline: continuous liquidity that shifts treasury operations from reactive to predictive and data-driven. For CFOs, that looks like intraday cash positioning without cutoffs; for controllers, like automated reconciliation; and for risk teams, like programmable controls around when, where and how funds can move.

For decades, cross-border transfers moved along correspondent banking networks. Today, banks and FinTechs can also use blockchain rails to move verified value almost instantly—cutting time and uncertainty.

J.P. Morgan's journey started with the Interbank Information Network, later Liink on the Onyx platform, to pre-validate transaction data. In 2024, the bank's blockchain arm was rebranded as Kinexys to unite payments, tokenization and programmable-money capabilities. Citi likewise integrated Citi Token Services with 24/7 USD Clearing to support real-time payments between its clients and those of participating third-party institutions on a permissioned platform. Networks are adapting, too: Visa B2B Connect routes transactions directly between banks on blockchain, and Mastercard is piloting programmable payments for conditional settlement and instant clearing. Ripple expanded RippleNet to offer near-instant cross-border transfers using tokenized fiat and the XRP Ledger for liquidity bridging.

Trade finance has been defined by paper, siloed information and post-fact reconciliation. Distributed ledgers potentially replace all that with a single source of truth that participants can rely on—reducing fraud risk and accelerating funding in jurisdictions where digital contracts are accepted by law.

Among the initiatives leading this shift was Contour, founded by banks including Citi, HSBC and ING. It was acquired by FinTech firm Xalts in early 2025, with Xalts continuing its work in digitizing letters of credit (LCs) and related processes across the existing network. Similarly, Komgo digitizes trade documents such as LCs and guarantees, offering real-time verification that helps banks and corporates reduce fraud and speed capital. Even retired platforms left durable standards: TradeLens (IBM and Maersk) pushed open-data models now adopted elsewhere, and the former Marco Polo Network by TradeIX and R3 automated receivables and payments via smart contracts—validating transactions in real time and releasing funds automatically once terms were met. The upshot: fewer disputes, faster cash, better auditability.

Tokenization is changing how institutions can issue, trade and hold assets. By representing ownership of securities, funds and even real estate on shared ledgers, banks can combine market liquidity with blockchain transparency for faster settlement, real-time ownership records and more granular control over transfers.

A few milestones illustrate the arc. BlackRock's BUIDL Fund—launched in March 2024—became the first tokenized U.S. Treasury fund for qualified investors on a public chain, enabling instant settlement and verifiable ownership. Goldman Sachs expanded its Digital Asset Platform to issue tokenized bonds and structured products with same-day clearing and real-time portfolio visibility. Citi collaborated with the SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) to connect traditional custody with blockchain-based infrastructures for tokenized private-market assets. Across Europe, BNP Paribas and Société Générale are issuing tokenized funds under MiCA, the comprehensive European Union framework for governing digital assets, while the European Central Bank continues integration work in 2025. The direction is clear: Tokenized markets have the potential to compress post-trade timelines and unlock new distribution channels and investor bases.

As digital assets enter mainstream banking, innovation and regulation are converging in software. Policymakers are testing privacy and anti-money laundering (AML) controls inside payment instruments, while banks adopt analytics and shared utilities to verify identity and provenance.

In particular, the International Monetary Fund's  (IMF's) FinTech Note (August 2025) outlined how central banks can embed safeguards within central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)—digital forms of a country's fiat currency issued and regulated by its central bank. The Monetary Authority of Singapore's Project Orchid tests programmable payments with built-in identity verification, and the United Kingdom's Project Rosalind—a Bank of England and Bank for International Settlements (BIS) collaboration—prototyped an application programming interface (API) framework that connected banks, FinTechs and merchants for secure CBDC payments. On the private side, partners like Chainalysis and Elliptic give banks tools to detect illicit activity across public and permissioned ledgers. Many banks are also building shared know your customer (KYC) utilities to store verified credentials on permissioned networks—aligning compliance and privacy.

Tokenized Deposits & Digital Cash: 24/7 liquidity, programmable cash flows, streamlined treasury. Examples: Citi (RLN), JPM Coin, HSBC
Cross-Border Payments: Instant settlement, lower FX/compliance costs, full traceability. Examples: Citi, J.P. Morgan, Ripple, Visa
Trade Finance & Supply Chain: Faster documentation, reduced fraud, verifiable provenance. Examples: Contour/Xalts (Citi, HSBC, ING), Komgo
Asset Tokenization & Custody: Fractional ownership, instant settlement, transparent reporting. Examples: BlackRock (BUIDL), Goldman Sachs, Citi + SDX
Regulated Identity & Compliance: Built-in KYC/AML controls, secure data sharing, enhanced auditability. Examples: MAS CBDC Pilot, BoE Project Rosalind, IMF FinTech Note

 





















As blockchain shifts from experimentation to potential implementation in global finance, the question is no longer whether blockchain networks will shape money movement but how they will do so in a controlled, compliant and scalable way across borders, currencies and institutions. As volumes rise and real-world, scalable use cases emerge, the key design choice now sits at the foundation: whether to transact on public, permissionless networks or private, permissioned chains that replicate institutional controls.

That decision is not abstract. Public chains offer global reach—an advantage that can support tokenized deposits, cross-border transfers and real-time settlement. But they also introduce questions around risk exposure, liability, regulatory treatment, sanctions compliance and identity assurance, requiring banks to evaluate how they safeguard funds and verify counterparties in an open ecosystem.

Private chains, by contrast, provide data privacy, operational control and governance, with defined participants and rule sets. Yet they can face challenges, since scale, liquidity and network effects may develop more slowly when access is limited.

As banks accelerate pilots into production, many are evaluating the adoption of hybrid approaches, choosing networks case-by-case based on the functions they need to perform and the risks they must manage.

These architectural questions are not roadblocks but design milestones. As institutions move further into rollout, policy frameworks will shape how fast the next wave of adoption unfolds. The foundation is now in place. The next step is alignment on standards and oversight—and that is where our next Tracker turns.

In practice, banks are advancing along two parallel blockchain tracks. Public, permissionless networks enable open settlement rails and global liquidity—key to tokenized cash, programmable settlement and institutional decentralized finance (DeFi) access. But they raise material considerations: who holds liability when funds move across a public chain, how risk and AML controls are enforced, and how legal frameworks apply at scale.

Private, permissioned networks give institutions confidence around identity, data control and transaction governance, aligning more naturally with existing regulatory expectations. Their challenge is achieving critical mass: If participation is limited, liquidity may remain fragmented and network efficiency could be constrained.

The emerging reality is convergence, not competition. Leading banks increasingly are looking to pursue selective interoperability, leveraging private networks for controlled flows and public chains for reach: a model that mirrors early internet adoption and positions blockchain as a shared financial infrastructure layer.

 





















Blockchain technology's widespread institutional adoption is imminent. The largest banks and payment networks are no longer testing—they're building. The next frontier is alignment: interoperability, standards and policies that connect private-sector innovation with public-sector oversight. The future of finance won't merely adapt to blockchain; increasingly, it will be built on it.

At Citi, we're actively exploring the future of finance with solutions like Citi Token Services, advancing programmable money and 24/7 liquidity. We're not only adopting blockchain technology but also harnessing it to help solve our clients' evolving needs safely and soundly.”

Providence has officially opened the Community Phase of its token sale, focusing exclusively on those with a direct history with the game, whether through game testing, social engagement, or feedback provision. Participants are required to fill out a detailed form on Providence's official website that verifies their past involvement and NFT ownership, like the necessary F8 Genesis.

🔥 Providence Pre-Demand: 24H UpdateIn the first 24 hours, we've passed 2,000+ entries. Engagement has been really strong. This is what happens when a player-first world finally opens its gates.Early alignment stats:• 15% of all F8 Genesis NFTs are now staked• 25%+ of… https://t.co/VN8LbbpkO8

With only 3,000 spots available, the Community Phase is intentionally limited to ensure a focused and genuine user base. This phase employs a bonding curve pricing model to advantage early participants with lower pricing which will ascend in subsequent phases. Unlike other token launches, there is no planned disclosure for set token prices or supply specifics at this stage.

Providence stands out with its third-person shooter gameplay set in dynamic, procedurally generated worlds. This game combines strategic play with PvPvE elements, demanding that players adapt swiftly to changing environments. Those accepted in the Community Phase receive a unique, soulbound Mark NFT, signifying early support and granting them access to the lowest price band within the game, special invites for others, and priority for new game features.

The importance of the F8 Genesis NFT escalates as it not only represents early involvement but also acts as a critical asset for Community Phase access. The observable rise in demand for these NFTs on platforms like OpenSea highlights their value in enhancing both player status and engagement levels within the game ecosystem.

Upon filling the initial 3,000 slots, Providence will roll out the Public Phase, introducing different terms and likely a higher pricing range. The shift aims to cater to a broader audience while still preserving the value granted to early members. Details on the complete tokenomics or the broader token generation event remain undisclosed, maintaining a focus on cultivating a solid base of committed players before expanding token access.

For those eager to partake in Providence's early token phase, applications are currently accepted via their website. However, applicants are reminded that submission does not guarantee acceptance, underscoring the exclusiveness and selectivity of this early opportunity.

Ethereum whales move ICO-era ETH, accumulate 800,000 new coins, while a weekly inverse head-and-shoulders pattern hints at macro shift.

Ethereum's biggest holders are back in motion, moving old ICO coins while adding fresh Ether during recent volatility. At the same time, a developing inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the weekly chart suggests Ethereum may be building a long-term bullish base.

An early Ethereum ICO participant shifted a small portion of long-held coins, onchain data from Onchain Lens shows. The wallet, labeled “ETH Millionaire,” controls 850 Ether bought for about $264 during the token sale. At current prices, that stash is valued near $2.82 million, marking a 10,663x return on the original outlay.

In the latest activity, the address moved 22 ETH worth roughly $72,936. The holder sent 21 ETH to a deposit address linked to Coinbase and transferred 1 ETH to a fresh wallet. The remaining balance stayed in the original address, which still holds the bulk of the ICO-era coins.

The transactions add to ongoing tracking of early Ethereum investors who are gradually testing liquidity on exchanges. However, the movement so far represents only a small fraction of the whale's total holdings, while most of the 850 ETH remains untouched onchain.

Meanwhile, Ethereum whales quietly increased their holdings over the past month, onchain data from Santiment shows. Addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH accumulated more than 800,000 coins during this period, even as price action stayed choppy. The chart from analyst Ali highlights how whale balances climbed while ETH moved through a wide trading range near the 3,000-dollar area.

This steady accumulation signals that large holders continued to buy on dips rather than reduce exposure. As the line tracking whale supply pushed higher, the price line showed several sharp swings, with rallies fading and new lows forming before a recent bounce. Yet, through these moves, the total held by big wallets kept rising, suggesting that long-term players treated volatility as an entry opportunity instead of a reason to exit.

Ethereum's weekly chart is shaping a potential inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, analyst Merlijn The Trader noted on X. The structure shows a deep low in the middle, or “head,” flanked by two higher troughs that form the left and right shoulders under a long-term resistance line.

In this view, the left shoulder emerged after the early 2024 rally cooled, while the head formed during the sharp drawdown that followed. The current rebound from late-2025 lows is now carving out the right shoulder, with price attempting to stabilize above prior support levels.

Merlijn describes this setup as one of the strongest bullish structures in crypto, pointing to its macro context on the higher timeframe. The pattern still requires confirmation from a clear breakout above the resistance zone, yet the chart highlights how ETH is retesting long-term levels as it builds this possible reversal base.

                            All You Need to Know About HumidiFy | Credit: Hameem Sarwar                        


Key Takeaways

HumidiFi just became one of the most talked-about launches on Solana, and for good reason.

As the first-ever ICO on Jupiter , WET burst out of the gate with massive trading volume, rapid community growth, and an immediate move to all-time highs.

But with launch hype still unfolding, traders now want to know: Is HumidiFi just getting started, or is the WET rally already topping out?

Here's everything you need to know.

According to the team, the launch of HumidiFi marks the beginning of DeFi 2.0.

HumidiFi is the liquidity engine of capital markets, bringing every market to trade on Solana.

HumidiFi is a hybrid decentralized exchange and market maker, claiming to offer lower fees than centralized exchanges while maintaining full custody.

Although there was an initial delay in the public sale, the relaunch proceeded smoothly, and the team believes  that no bots were able to buy.

Shortly after the sale, the Titan Exchange confirmed  that it would list WET for trading.

The community reaction has been overwhelmingly positive.

Prominent voices, such as Meow, congratulated the team, praising its expertise and the launch.

For DTF, this has been a rocky yet ultimately successful first launch. The team has learnt a ton from this, and they will improve immensely from here on, he stated.

Today we declare victory for Weterans and defeat for bots.

Shout out to all the Weterans for coming on this journey with us. Shout out to our partners at @JupiterExchange  for working with us to implement some extremely wet anti-snipe features on their new DTF platform.

Those who have staked JUP  have already made roughly three times their investment, and the community is bullish considering WET is the first Jupiter launchpad.

The WET price rallied after its launch, increasing gradually.

It reached a new all-time high of $0.27 earlier today before falling.

The price movement is contained inside an ascending parallel channel.

Earlier today, WET attempted two unsuccessful breakouts (red icons).

Nevertheless, it still trades in the channel's upper portion. 

If the WET price breaks out, it could surge to new highs quickly.

On the other hand, a rejection could cause WET to plunge 15% to the support trend line.

HumidiFi's debut was one of the strongest launches in recent Solana history.

As the first ICO on Jupiter, backed by community hype and early exchange listings, WET has already demonstrated its ability to attract significant demand.

However, with the price still consolidating within a rising channel, the next breakout or rejection will determine whether WET enters its next explosive leg up or resets before continuing its upward trend.

For now, one thing is clear: HumidiFi has captured the market's attention.","{'href': 'https://www.ccn.com', 'title': 'CCN.com'}","cryptocurrency"

Rep. Keith Self (R., Texas) on Tuesday filed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would bar a U.S. central-bank digital currency as the House Rules Committee prepares to decide whether it advances to a floor vote.

""Promises were broken to include this language in the NDAA,” Self tweeted. “My amendment would fix the bill.""

House GOP leaders plan to pass the defense bill late Wednesday afternoon, according to a Politico report, citing anonymous sources.

A CBDC is a digital currency issued, regulated, and backed by a country's central bank, comparable to fiat currency.

Self's amendment, titled ""Anti-CBDC Surveillance State,"" would prohibit the Federal Reserve from testing, developing, or implementing a CBDC or ""any digital asset that is substantially similar under any other name or label."" 

It would also bar Federal Reserve banks from offering financial products directly to individuals or maintaining accounts on their behalf.

The amendment also carves out exceptions for ""dollar-denominated currency that is open, permissionless, and private,"" preserving privacy protections similar to those of physical cash.

The National Defense Authorization Act is the annual legislation passed by Congress and signed by the President authorizing the Department of Defense's budget, spending, and policy for the year ahead. 

House GOP leaders unveiled the 3,086-page defense bill Sunday without the CBDC ban language that Speaker Mike Johnson had reportedly promised conservatives.

The move triggered pushback from hard-line Republicans who view the omission as a broken commitment on a key policy priority.

Self told Fox Business that conservatives were promised, ""an anti-Central Bank digital currency language, authored by Tom Emmer, the whip, would be in the NDAA."" 

After reviewing the bill for several hours, he confirmed it wasn't included.

""We have to pass an NDAA, because it's one of the must-pass bills we have in Congress,"" Self said. ""We've got to fix it and get it passed.""

Other Republicans raised the same concerns as Self, with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) noting that she supports crypto but will not support any system that lets the government cut off Americans' ability to control, buy, or sell with their own money.

""CBDC inserts the government between you and your money then sets conditions on your access to it,” Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) tweeted on Tuesday.""The President's EO banning CBDC is great, but we need and were promised a law,” he added.

In January, President Trump signed his first crypto-related executive order, which prohibits federal agencies from establishing, issuing, or promoting CBDCs in the U.S. or abroad, citing risks to financial stability, individual privacy, and national sovereignty. 

A House leadership aide told The Hill that efforts to include the CBDC ban ""fell apart amid negotiations over the bipartisan housing package,"" adding that securing a deal on the digital currency restriction ""was not something that was ultimately going to be acceptable to our members.""

Rep. Keith Self, a Republican from Texas, filed a last-minute amendment to the Must-Pass $900 billion US Defence Bill that would ban the Federal Reserve from creating or piloting a US central bank digital currency (CBDC). On 9 December 2025, the Republican took to X to say, “Promises were broken to include this language in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). My amendment would fix the bill.”

Self's “Anti-CBDC Surveillance State” proposal would bar the Fed from testing, developing or launching any CBDC. He submitted an amendment to add a full ban on CBDCs to the 2026 NDAA. He argued that the earlier leadership promises to include similar language were broken in the final compromise text.

“The House Rules Committee meets later TODAY to decide if it gets a floor vote,” he added. “I hope they do the right thing.”

Notably, during the 2024 campaign, US President Donald Trump called CBDCs a “dangerous threat to freedom” and pledged never to allow a Fed-run digital dollar, once back in office.

In 2025, trump singed an executive order intrusting federal agencies not to develop or promote a US CBDC. But since executive orders can be reversed by future administrations, Republican party lawmakers are pushing to lock an anti-CBDC stance through amendments to the NDAA.

“Conservatives were promised that language banning a CBDC would be included in the must-pass NDAA,” said Self. “Unconscionably, it wasn't included. Leadership needs to fix this bill IMMEDIATELY.”

Republicans also argue that a CBDC would hand the federal government a “surveillance tool” similar to systems in China. They fear real-time tracking and potential blocking of transactions based on political or social behaviour.

Some are even threatening to withdraw support from the defense bill itself unless leadership allows a floor vote on Self's amendment.

While Anti-CBDC bill aims to permanently block any form of a US central bank digital currency, citing surveillance concerns, the CLARITY Act carries huge weight in the crypto world. The CLARITY Act aims to end the chaos over which agency SEC or the CFTC, calls the shots on crypto. It also includes consumer protections and hints at tailored rules for DeFi and stablecoins.

Ryan Li has long been steeped in the worlds of both AI and crypto. He started working with AI about ten years ago as an undergrad at UC Berkeley and has since built two crypto startups. That experience has led him to conclude that popular AI platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity give rise to far too many hallucinations about crypto—and that those errors can cost traders millions, if not billions, of dollars. That's why he cofounded Surf, an AI platform specialized for the world of crypto. 

On Wednesday, his startup announced that it raised $15 million from Pantera Capital, with participation from Coinbase Ventures and Digital Currency Group. Li, the startup's CEO, did not disclose the company's valuation in an interview with Fortune. 

“Surf was something that we wanted to build for ourselves, and it turns out the market loves it,” he said. “I think Surf is the best model for crypto, and we want to make sure people trust Surf instead of relying on hallucinations from other models.”

The product launched as an invite-only service in July before opening to the general public in September. It has more than 300,000 people using the platform and has generated more than a million search results, according to the company. Li says that the platform can answer a spectrum of questions about crypto, from the most basic to the most technical concepts. He says that 80% of the platform's users are regular people who don't work in crypto, and the remaining 20% are from venture capital firms, exchanges, and other crypto-affiliated companies. 

The startup says that it has a couple of million dollars in revenue and hopes to reach $10 million by the end of 2026. Surf generates revenue by charging a subscription fee, with users paying $15 to $399 per month on different tiers of the service. People can access a free version in which they can only ask a few questions per day. The company currently has just under 30 employees. 

Li views his startup's competition as mainstream AI models like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Grok. The company says that its platform performs four times better than ChatGPT and Grok on crypto tasks, based on benchmark testing it co-authored with Princeton University. While ChatGPT may be slightly faster, Surf had answers that were more specific to crypto and had more citations, based on a side-by-side comparison of the two platforms that Li shared with Fortune. 

“ChatGPT is a really good generalist, but it doesn't know the crypto industry enough,” Li said. “Surf is like that expert that worked in the industry for a long time by us training the model just for crypto.” 

With the new funding, the startup plans to launch Surf 2.0, a more advanced model, in February 2026.

We know cryptocurrency is driven by incredible underlying technology, constantly pushing for faster transactions and more private, advanced blockchain setups. But what happens when the industry's focus on complexity outpaces the ability of an everyday person to use it? Today, the biggest challenge isn't building new tech; it's fixing confusing user experience, or UX. Accessibility is king, and history backs this up; it's why booking a taxi on your phone or sending cash instantly via a digital wallet feels so seamless. Crypto can't achieve true, widespread adoption until its apps shed the clunky design and feel just as intuitive and simple as those mainstream services.

Even as crypto goes global, a massive user base finds blockchain apps confusing. It's not a niche problem: a 2024 Statista report confirms that over 40% of people avoid digital assets entirely because they cite “complexity.” This isn't about education; it's entirely about bad design. New users simply expect the smooth navigation, clear directions, and predictable setup they see in every other modern app. Yet, a lot of wallets and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) still force users to stare at screens that resemble a coder's terminal. This creates an unhelpful divide between cutting-edge innovation and real accessibility for the public.

By comparison, the most successful digital platforms all follow the same playbook: they simplify the complicated. Think about online banking apps, which use intuitive layouts to make financial management totally straightforward. Similarly, platforms ranging from casinos online to streaming services heavily prioritize quick feedback, responsiveness, and clarity. These qualities are absolutely vital because they are what build user confidence and make people comfortable using new, powerful technologies.

Crypto developers can draw several UX lessons from digital platforms that have already won user trust. The first is onboarding. Good platforms guide new users step-by-step, using visual cues or short tutorials. Binance and Coinbase, for example, include built-in walkthroughs for first-time traders. These helps reduce friction and build confidence early on.

The second lesson is familiar design patterns. People naturally gravitate toward interfaces that resemble the apps they already use. By keeping buttons, navigation bars, and icons consistent with common digital norms, crypto apps can reduce the learning curve.

Finally, there's performance and feedback. Delays or confusing error messages can turn off new users fast. A 2023 Deloitte survey on app engagement showed that responsiveness and real-time feedback significantly increase user retention. Crypto wallets, in particular, can benefit from clearer transaction confirmations and transparent status updates.

The tight balance between essential security and everyday simplicity is crypto's biggest UX headache. Basic necessities like seed phrases and 2FA often scare away newcomers. Smart apps are tackling this directly: Web3 wallets like Argent and Magic ease onboarding with simple social logins or multi-signature systems, simplifying control management without eliminating it. Developers must avoid the urge to oversimplify. Presenting the necessary technical parts clearly builds user confidence, which is the best defense against making costly, irreversible errors.

The real secret to good UX design in crypto is surprisingly simple: empathy. This isn't about the aesthetic of the app or its navigation structure. It's the designer's job to remember that the typical person logging on isn't a professional developer or a stock market whale. This understanding is the foundation for creating tools that are genuinely intuitive and automatically inclusive. As crypto breaks out and heads toward the mainstream, the developers who obsess over this human element, usability, will quickly become the market leaders. Blockchain might have been born in a niche corner of the web, but it's rapidly evolving into a foundational technology for almost everything digital, from finance to supply chains to how we consume media. The next great challenge is making sure that the future is a door, not a gate, for every single person.

Home > Regulation > Coinbase CEO Slams Europe's Approach to U.S. Tech Companies

TL;DR:

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has escalated his criticism of Europe's regulatory stance, arguing that the bloc is extracting outsized value from American tech giants through punitive enforcement instead of transparent taxation, after calling the European Union's growing reliance on fines against U.S. platforms “borderline looting” in a post on X. He framed 2024 data he cited as evidence of an economic strategy that treats regulation as a profit center.



At some point with enough regulation producing fines, it borders on looting.

You can have more fines from over-regulation, or you can have a growing economy, but you can't have both. https://t.co/nMXjVGevpu

— Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) December 9, 2025



Armstrong said the EU imposed €3.8 billion in fines on U.S. technology companies last year compared with €3.2 billion in corporate income tax paid by all publicly listed European internet firms, arguing that when penalty revenue exceeds normal tax receipts it signals a policy mix that favors extraction over long term growth. In his view, governments can have more fines from over regulation or a growing economy, but not both at the same time.











His comments land as Brussels tightens oversight of digital platforms through the Digital Services Act, a framework that has already produced high profile sanctions, including a €120 million penalty against X for alleged violations of content rules, fueling Armstrong's contention that U.S. firms are being treated as convenient revenue sources rather than partners in Europe's digital economy. He warned that aggressive enforcement risks chilling innovation in sectors ranging from online platforms to artificial intelligence and financial technology.

At the same time, the EU is rolling out its Markets in Crypto Assets regulation, the first comprehensive crypto rulebook among major economies, and Coinbase has positioned Ireland as its European regulatory hub to adapt, publicly embracing the need to comply with MiCA even as it pushes back on what it sees as disproportionate treatment of U.S. headquartered firms. The exchange has said that predictable, passportable rules can be a competitive advantage if they are applied consistently across jurisdictions.

Yet Coinbase itself has faced consequences under the same tightening regime. The Central Bank of Ireland recently fined Coinbase Europe €21.5 million for anti money laundering monitoring failures between 2021 and 2025, underscoring regulators' insistence that even high profile advocates of innovation must invest in surveillance and risk controls. As debates over MiCA and digital policy continue, Armstrong's “borderline looting” remark crystalizes a deeper transatlantic dispute over how to balance consumer protection, tax policy and the competitiveness of U.S. technology champions.

SpaceX is working toward a stock-market listing that could value the company at around $1.5 trillion, making it the biggest public market offering by that metric, according to Bloomberg.

If that happens, investors won't just be buying into rockets and satellites. They'll also be buying into a company that holds thousands of bitcoin and has already used dogecoin to fund a mission to the Moon.

A Bloomberg report late Tuesday said the Elon Musk–run company is moving ahead with plans for an initial public offering that would seek to raise “significantly more than $30 billion,” targeting a valuation in the region of $1.5 trillion and a listing as soon as mid-to-late 2026.

At that scale, even small balance-sheet allocations matter.

Arkham Intelligence, a blockchain analytics firm that tracks identified entities, shows a wallet cluster labeled “SpaceX” holding about 3,991 BTC, worth roughly $369 million at a bitcoin price of around $92,500.

The addresses are tagged as being held via Coinbase Prime custody, and the balance history chart indicates the holding has fluctuated over the past several years – rising sharply during the 2021–2022 bull market, then dropping and later rebuilding through 2024 and 2025.

Recent transfers in Arkham's view show large internal movements on bitcoin's base layer, with two transactions of just over 1,000 BTC each in the past week, alongside smaller flows between Coinbase Prime and addresses in the cluster.

It's worth noting that these transfers could be internal transfers, as opposed to any buys or sells.

While the deal is still more than a year away and contingent on market conditions, Musk's proximity to crypto continues to amplify every development.

Musk's influence on dogecoin is well documented, from him posting memes that moved markets to SpaceX accepting the token for its DOGE-1 lunar mission.

His companies were among the earliest institutional bitcoin adopters, with renewables tech company Tesla reporting over 11,000 BTC holdings on its balance sheet.

A SpaceX IPO would give him fresh capital for Starlink expansion and chip-heavy space data centers, potentially broadening his influence in sectors that intersect with both AI and crypto infrastructure.

Meanwhile, early data from prediction market Polymarket show growing confidence that SpaceX's valuation at IPO could exceed $1 trillion, with traders assigning a 67% probability that the market cap surpasses the benchmark as of early Wednesday.

Memecoin factory Pump.fun became one of the most influential and polarizing forces in crypto this year, powering a surge of token creation, fueling speculative excess, and testing the limits of retail participation.

This feature is a part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2025 list.

Launched in early 2024, Pump.fun offers users a way to create a token in seconds for less than two cents' worth of SOL, no coding required. That recipe saw the platform start deploying to over 80% of Solana-based tokens by mid-2025.

That breakneck pace drove up blockchain activity and funneled huge volumes of trading into Solana's decentralized exchanges, with Pump.fun itself seeing more than $150 billion in cumulative volume according to DeFiLlama.

At its peak, Pump.fun generated $138 million in monthly revenue, with daily spikes as high as $15 million. A defining moment came in July, when its PUMP token sale raised an estimated $500 million in under 12 minutes at a $4 billion fully diluted valuation.

The mania spread quickly. Tokens with names like Fartcoin, Goatseus Maximus, and Peanut the Squirrel saw sudden market caps in the hundreds of millions as memecoin trading fever kept on growing.

But behind the froth was also a darker story. The vast majority of tokens collapsed shortly after launch, often due to scams or bot activity. Long-term holders were rare. Analysts flagged rising retail losses, and regulators took notice. U.S. lawsuits alleged fraud and securities violations.

After the hype peaked, revenue fell sharply, down 80% from the peak. Pump.fun's influence, however, hasn't faded, and token launchpads remain a relevant part of the DeFi sector.

Strategy (MSTR) has written a formal letter in response to MSCI's proposal to exclude companies whose digital asset holdings represent 50% or more of total assets from MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes. 

Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, Strategy argued that digital asset treasury companies (DATs), including Strategy itself, are operating businesses that use digital assets as productive capital, not passive vehicles for tracking price movements. Strategy builds bitcoin backed credit instruments, manages an active corporate treasury program and maintains a global enterprise analytics software business. Investors buy the company's strategy and management, not a static wrapper for bitcoin, the company said. 

Already under serious pressure thanks to falling bitcoin prices and a narrowing mNAV (the premium to bitcoin holdings at which investors value a company), Strategy shares tumbled even further two weeks ago as the MSCI proposal came to light. MSTR stands to loss many billions in passive capital flows should it be removed from MSCI indexes.

Turning back to Strategy's arguments, the company also listed five reasons the company is not an investment fund: 1. Strategy is organized as a conventional operating company.

2. The company has no fund or ETP like structure or obligations.

3. MSTR is not an investment company under applicable laws.

4. The company creates no fund like tax treatment for investors 

5. It has a long history as an operating software business.

The proposed 50% threshold is described as arbitrary and unworkable, Strategy said. Many companies hold concentrated reserves in oil, real estate, timber or utilities, yet remain eligible for MSCI indices. MSCI is thus singling out only digital asset backed companies.

Strategy further argued that the proposal injects policy views into index construction at a time when federal policy has shifted toward supporting digital asset innovation. Excluding DATs could force large passive outflows, undermine American competitiveness and slow the expansion of new financial technologies.

If MSCI continues to remain inclined to treat DATs differently, Strategy urged the firm to extend the consultation and provide a more detailed basis for any proposed changes.

NASA's Perseverance Rover Faces New Uncertainty on Mars

NASA's Perseverance rover has gathered groundbreaking Mars samples, but the mission to bring them home is facing serious challenges.

By Kendra Pierre-Louis, Lee Billings, Fonda Mwangi & Alex Sugiura 

NASA/Handout/Getty Images

Kendra Pierre-Louis: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Kendra Pierre-Louis, in for Rachel Feltman.

In July of 2020, NASA engineers sent a rover named Perseverance hurtling into space.

And in pictures it kind of looked like the diminutive robot in the Disney-Pixar film WALL-E—just much, much larger.

Perseverance, however, has spent its nearly five years on Mars focused on a very different mission. Instead of collecting trash Perseverance has roamed the Red Planet collecting rock samples, with the goal, in part, of finding potential evidence of life on Mars. The plan is to send the samples back to Earth, where they'd undergo further study. But that project, known as Mars Sample Return, is hanging on by a thread.

To walk us through what's happening we are joined today by Lee Billings, a senior desk editor here at SciAm. Thanks for joining us, Lee.

Lee Billings: Kendra, it's great to be here, as always.

Pierre-Louis: You know, I think to begin can you tell us broadly about the mission that Perseverance was tasked with completing on Mars?

Billings: Sure, Perseverance landed on Mars in early 2021; it was launched in 2020. And it was a follow-up to Curiosity, another NASA Mars rover. But the point is, is that Perseverance's goal, it's kind of the apex of planning for something called Mars Sample Return, which has been going on for decades ...

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Billings: You know, back to the 1990s, even back to the 1960s, if you look back on it.

And the whole core idea is: we can study rocks better here on Earth than we can on Mars because it's hard to lift or build a huge wet lab on another planet ...

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Billings: It's easier to bring smaller little bits of stuff back here.

And so Perseverance was crucial to that—in, again, kind of a very incremental way—building on a lot of the missions that had come before, in that Perseverance is actually kind of where the rubber meets the road, so to speak, where NASA scientists and other scientists from other institutions had narrowed down a short list of places to go on Mars to look for potential signs of life. And then from that short list they actually found a place, called Jezero Crater, this 30-mile-wide—almost 30-mile-wide depression in Mars that used to harbor an ancient lake and river delta and all this stuff.

And that's where Perseverance landed—had a rather nail-biting landing with the Sky Crane from JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory] that involved rockets and wires [delivering] this thing down to the surface. And it's been there, again, for the past several years, gathering samples, using a lot of its onboard instrumentation to figure out which of the rocks, which of the parts of the environment around there are most interesting to bring back to Earth. And it has 43, I believe, sample tubes—that's how many it carries—and the idea is that, in each one of these sample tubes, it can deposit a little sample, a little bit of Mars, to bring back to Earth someday.

But you can see, Perseverance is really good at finding these samples and collecting these samples—it has no capability whatsoever to actually bring these things back to Earth. That's a whole separate, subsequent phase of the mission and the thing that's really become this very troublesome roadblock and obstacle now for the program at large.

Pierre-Louis: What's driving this fascination with Mars?

Billings: So the big question, of course, is: “Are we alone?” And Mars is right next door, relatively speaking, and it has a lot of indications that suggest that it really wasn't so bad for life as we know it billions of years ago. If you think about the Mars of four or three billion years ago, this was a time when we see abundant signs on the planet of flowing water, of thicker atmosphere.

Right now, let's be clear, Mars is a frozen, terrible place to live. It's a freeze-dried mud ball.

Pierre-Louis: It feels like you're describing my apartment. [Laughs.]

Billings: [Laughs.] Or parts of my house, for that matter. It's not a good place to live, despite what some people might say. But long ago you could imagine it actually not being so bad of a place to live, to the degree that we really don't necessarily know of someplace that has a relatively Earth-like—or Earth-adjacent, we might call [it]—environment in which we could imagine life as we know it being able to exist.

And of course, “life as we know it” doesn't just include podcasters talking to each other into microphones but also little, tiny, microscopic single-celled organisms, microbes, which is really what most people would think would be on Mars rather than, you know, little green men or some kind of strange polar bear that's gonna eat you.

Pierre-Louis: Or TikTok influencers.

Billings: That's right, even though sometimes they do seem like they're from Mars.

And so the, the core idea really driving all this is trying to figure out whether or not we're alone. Because if you think about it, if we can find—if we can show that there were microbes on Mars, that there were Martians, that the planet was once alive, that's huge because that would suggest that life gets started pretty easily and that it must be out there everywhere. If we can look at the planet right next door to us and we can see that it was a true so-called independent origin or second genesis that would be huge.

There is this one sample, or this one singular rock, that Perseverance has found on Mars: a big hunk of mudstone on the rim of this crater that used to harbor, billions of years ago, a big lake and, and riverine delta. [The rock is] called “Cheyava Falls,” and it's filled with organic matter. That is stuff that's rich in carbon, the molecular backbone of life as we know it. That's a pretty important thing because where you see organics on Earth, you tend to see life.

It also displays very tantalizing patterns on its surface and in the matrix of the rock itself; they're called “poppy seeds” and “leopard spots.” And in short we see rocks that have those same types of features on Earth, and they can be produced abiotically, through lifeless processes over lots of time via a little bit of heating and some chemistry, but most of the time, when we see them on Earth, they're due to little microbes, little bugs in the rock, that use iron minerals to get energy to drive their metabolism.

And so based on everything that Perseverance has seen of this rock and has studied from this rock it looks like the rock formed in conditions that are closer to what we'd expect for life to be there. So it's not something that happened via volcanic eruption or some sudden event like that it; it's rather like, okay, this mudstone was deposited on the bottom of this ancient lake billions of years ago and sat there, and at some point, somehow, these really curious marks and speckles got all over it. And the best explanation that we have right now for those marks and speckles is microbes munching on iron and other minerals inside the rock.

So the evidence for life beyond Earth may already literally be in hand—almost. Perseverance has taken samples of this rock. It has stored the sample. It is ready to come to Earth. All we need to do is go there and get it. And that could be the most epochal discovery in history, to know that we're actually not alone.

So that is the big thing, but it's not the only thing—a lot of people get hung up on this. Even if Mars Sample Return reveals no life at this site or no life anywhere on the planet after we've exhaustively looked everywhere somehow, we would still learn so much about Mars, and that's important because Mars is kind of giving us an idea of the limits of habitability that we will potentially someday encounter on our own planet. It's showing us how a planet dies. It shows us how a once-relatively-nice place decays into a not-so-nice place. And studying the mechanics of that and knowing how that happened is valuable for being good stewards of our own planet.

Pierre-Louis: And so one of the things that is putting Mars Sample Return kind of in limbo is this question of funding, correct?

Billings: That's correct, yes. Big time. Big time. Because of course, we've never launched anything from Mars before, and that's how you have to get the samples back to Earth. But that's expensive. How do you do it? How many stages are there? The plan of record, up until the past couple years, it was supposed to cost—phew, man, I think it was about $6 billion was how [much] it was supposed to cost ...

Pierre-Louis: I spend that on shoes. [Laughs.]

Billings: [Laughs.] I mean, you know, a billion here, a billion there pretty much adds up to real money. But obviously, that is a lot of money. What happened was that this plan, it involved first retrieving the samples with a second rover that goes there to retrieve the samples and then that rover bringing the samples from Perseverance, or from a cache where they've been dropped on the ground, back to a launch site or maybe just launching from that same platform; launching it up into orbit, where it would rendezvous with an orbiting spacecraft that would take in the sample, store it, secure it, and then blast it back to Earth, on a long journey back to Earth, where it would then, you know, land somewhere in the U.S. high desert, probably, of the Southwest U.S., and be collected and taken to specialized facilities that are all biohazarded up, right? You think of, like, The Hot Zone or other things, you know, the place that they go to study Ebola, stuff like that, that's the same kind of facility they would take this stuff to, just 'cause we don't really know for sure. And then they would—you know, scientists would painstakingly analyze it for years and years, and eventually, parts of the samples would probably be distributed to other institutions around the world, and we'd all learn a lot more about Mars.

But yes, the problem is getting it off the ground 'cause that takes a lot of money. An analysis that was done that basically showed it was behind schedule and over cost, and the costs were looking to be upwards of $11 billion, so, you know, nearly a double in the estimated price tag. And we were looking at samples not really getting back here until 2040 at the earliest. And the former administrator of NASA, former senator and shuttle astronaut Bill Nelson, outgoing from the Biden administration, said, “You know, that's just too long to wait. That's too much money. We gotta find a faster, better, cheaper way to do it.” But he left the core decision-making on that to the Trump administration.

Pierre-Louis: So we're in 2025 now. It took Perseverance about six months to get to Mars. Why would it take 15 years for the samples to get back?

Billings: Well, one thing to think about is that planets revolve around the sun—“Oh, well, of course they do.” But what that means is that they don't necessarily all revolve at the same rate, in lockstep with each other. About every two years you have an alignment between Earth and Mars that allows us to get there more easily, with less fuel from a rocket. You know, everything you take off the Earth into orbit costs money to get up there, and it's a pretty exorbitant price, even though the price is falling. And so the less fuel you need to burn to get to Mars the cheaper your mission's gonna be. So every two years is one thing to think about.

The other thing to think about is that we're still talking about huge pieces of hardware that are either being built or not fully built. So that includes things like, you know, the rover that's going to retrieve the samples from Mars, from wherever Perseverance has stored them or wherever Perseverance is. It includes whatever system you're going to use to launch that thing back into orbit. It may include, you know, the Earth-return vehicle—all these components. It even includes the facilities on the Earth, you know, biohazard-style facilities that I mentioned earlier, that are needed to make people feel safe to have this stuff on our planet. All that stuff is included, and so that takes time to do.

And it's the kind of thing where if you threw money at it in some kind of Apollo program “let's beat the Russians to the moon”–style race, you could do it much faster, yes. But the trouble is, is that that's not what NASA is anymore. NASA hasn't been that for a long time, so singularly focused. And it's not just a problem of, oh, a lack of political will or something. It's also the broader problem that because NASA's different, because it has so much more stuff in its portfolio, there was and is a real risk that throwing too much money at Mars Sample Return would come at the very direct cost of much less money for pretty much everything else, for instance, in planetary science. And there's so many cool things out there in the solar system to see, whether you're thinking about the moon of Jupiter Europa or various moons around Saturn, for instance, or even Venus, that it's a pretty hard ask, I think, to say, “Well, let's just put all our eggs in the Mars basket.”

Pierre-Louis: So my understanding is the Biden administration, when they were like, “We're gonna look for alternative methods,” they were really looking towards commercial space. And can we talk a little bit about kind of the push for Mars from the commercial side?

Billings: Absolutely. The rise of commercial space, the new era that we are in and advancing into, was a key factor, I think, in the political decision-making that happened that brought us to this crossroads moment for Mars Sample Return because it's undeniable that the rates of launches are soaring and there are more players, more capabilities than ever before, more competition than ever before, more ways to potentially get this done. And not all of them necessarily have to rely on tried-and-true legacy ways that have certain price tags and costs associated with them.

So for instance, people love to talk about SpaceX, and most of the focus is on how SpaceX might help NASA astronauts return to the moon as part of the Artemis program, and the cornerstone of that is this huge, immensely gigantic megarocket that's intended to be fully reusable, which is the first time in history we've ever tried to do that, really, called Starship, that they keep testing and that it keeps blowing up or falling apart, right? So one idea, for instance, was: maybe we can just, if Starship works out really well getting people to the moon, we can just co-opt one of those Starships and send it to Mars and plop it down, and it can do all sorts of things.

But SpaceX isn't the only game in town, right? So Blue Origin, the company from Jeff Bezos of Amazon fame, is also a launch provider. They have proposed something to NASA, some kind of Plan B that they could provide to try to get these samples home. Another example would be a dark horse, in that most people don't really know about it as much, is the company called Rocket Lab. The plan from Rocket Lab that they've publicized claims to be able to deliver the samples from Perseverance for a price of about $4 billion, rather than something like $6 billion or $11 billion or more. And we don't have those numbers for all the proposals, and there's more proposals than I'm mentioning from other commercial outfits. But the point is is that there is a very strong, compelling case to be made, I think, that we can indeed do much of this, if not all of this, for much cheaper than what was previously the plan of record.

Pierre-Louis: This has been lovely. Thank you so much for your time.

Billings: It's my pleasure, Kendra. Thanks for talking with me.

How Animals Form Unlikely Alliances to Keep Predators Away

Cross-species “defense pacts” help animals keep tabs on parasites and predators

By Jesse Greenspan edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

Parasitic cuckoos are many birds' common enemy.

When danger approaches, many creatures seem to follow the ancient proverb that “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” Researchers have recently been finding subtle ways that animals communicate with other species in this kind of cooperative defense pact.

For example, a recent study in Nature Ecology & Evolution documented more than 20 bird species on four continents that emit virtually identical “whining” calls when they spot brood parasites such as cuckoos. That call is essentially “the word for ‘cuckoo,'” says study co-lead author James Kennerley, an ornithologist at Cornell University. “And it's recruiting individuals to come together [against] this common enemy.”

Brood parasites lay eggs in other birds' nests, manipulating the host parents into raising their chicks for them. At a field site in Australia, Kennerley has witnessed individuals from a dozen or more species mob a cuckoo in response to a chorus of whining calls. These mobs can be so ferocious that Kennerley and his colleagues need to cage the taxidermy cuckoo used in their experiments to protect it. Otherwise the attacking birds would have “just completely shredded it to pieces,” Kennerley says.

Many birds also share a common vocabulary for predators. Research by wildlife ecologist Erick Greene, an emeritus professor at the University of Montana, and others shows that various songbirds—and even red squirrels—produce recognizable “seet” calls to warn of a raptor in flight. The calls are too high-pitched for raptors to hear well, so the predators remain oblivious as info about their arrival shoots through the forest. If the raptor perches, songbirds switch to “mobbing” calls, a distinct vocalization that, as Greene puts it, “draws in the troops [to] drive that raptor out of Dodge.”

Monkeys, lemurs and chipmunks also recognize other species' alarm calls. And in coral reefs, unrelated fish seem to swap visual and chemical cues as protection against dangers such as hungry barracudas. But cooperative defense is not the only reason for cross-species communication. Among other things, it may help birds migrate and enhance food intake among mixed-species monkey troops and dolphin pods. A recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA found that when seabirds with good vision, such as black-browed albatrosses, forage with seabirds with strong senses of smell, such as white-chinned petrels, they both have far greater success at catching krill. Unlike with the seet and whining calls, however, it's unclear whether they're deliberately signaling to one another or “just randomly following other birds,” says study lead author Jesse Granger, an organismal biophysicist at Duke University.

But clearly, “very complex multispecies communication networks are pervasive,” Greene says. “It really behooves [animals] to pay attention to one another,” he adds. “It can save their lives.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Archaeologists Opened an Ancient Tomb—and Found a Story of Royal Tragedy","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a69622331/upside-down-crown/","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

A crown was left with the deceased, but its position indicated her reign may not have ended the way she would have liked. 

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

There's no telling who the noblewoman recently found buried during the second half of the seventh century B.C.E. was at the time of her death, so for now, she's known as “The Lady with the Inverted Diadem.” 

According to a translated statement from the Greek Ministry of Culture, a team of archaeologists found a cemetery in east-central Greece, about 60 miles northwest of Athens, full of tombs dated from about 800 to 320 B.C.E., during the Archaic and Classical periods. The cemetery was developed in clusters with pit tombs, burial mounds, and tiled tombs. 

So far, the team has excavated roughly 40 of the burial sites, many showcasing the elite status of those buried there. Still, none was more impressive—or intriguing—than “The Lady with the Inverted Diadem.” 

The deceased was found within a cluster of three pit tombs, and the bronze grave goods filling the tomb made clear that its occupant was a noblewoman. A preliminary examination of dental remains showed she was an adult woman between 20 and 30 years old. The striking part of the find, though, was a bronze-banded diadem (or crown) ceremoniously placed on her head upside down as a symbol of her superiority or rank. The crown featured a large rosette in the form of a sun in the center of the front and facing pairs of male and female lions on the back. The high craftsmanship needed to create the animals was evident, the archaeologists said. While lions symbolized royal power and authority, when the crown was flipped upside down, the lions were seen lying down. 

That superiority of rank and high class may not have lasted beyond the death of the noblewoman. During that time, a crown worn upside down symbolized the resignation or fall of the monarch and marked the loss of power and office. 

The ministry said that the mid-seventh century B.C.E. marked a particularly tumultuous time for any monarchs in Greece, as the traditional hereditary kingdom regimes and the rise of nobles had started to give way to aristocratic regimes and the movement to Athenian democracy by the early sixth century B.C.E. It's in that context that the upside-down crown may indicate that the deceased noblewoman was caught up in the changing times. 

While she may have lost her standing, she likely didn't lose her wealth. The grave goods buried with the young woman featured plenty of bronze items, including two oversized pins with engraved geometric-style horses, a necklace with a pendant, bone and ivory beads, amber tokens, and bronze earrings. She was buried wearing bracelets and rings. 

In the same cluster of tombs, the team found a young girl, likely around 4 years old, crowned with a similar bronze diadem with inlaid rosettes. The girl had comparable jewelry to the noblewoman, indicating the possible existence of a family bond between them. 

Other tomb finds in the area have included a female form the mid-sixth century B.C.E. buried with a shallow bowl with a rooster depiction on it, a wine vessel decorated with mythical creatures and the god Hermes, a copper bottle, and vessels associated with the Akraifia Pottery Workshop. The team plans to continue researching the area.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Simple supplement mix shows remarkable results in brain cancer","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251209043050.htm","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 08:58:36 GMT","

Most cancer treatments, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy, are designed to attack and destroy cancer cells. A growing group of researchers is now asking whether this long-standing approach may be missing something important. What if the real path to a cure is not to damage cancer, but to coax it into healing instead?

That provocative idea is at the heart of work led by Professor Indraneel Mittra at the Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer in Mumbai, India.

The concept is not completely new. In 1986, an article in the New Journal of Medicine by Dr. Harold Dvorak suggested that cancer behaves very much like a wound that never heals. Cancer and chronic wounds share many biological features, and Professor Mittra argues that, rather than always trying to destroy tumors, medicine should explore ways to help them move toward a healed, less aggressive state.

In a recent study involving people with glioblastoma, one of the most feared brain cancers, his team reports that a simple combination of two low-cost nutraceuticals appears to support exactly this kind of healing process.

Testing a Gentle Strategy in Glioblastoma

Glioblastoma is a fast-growing, highly aggressive brain tumor. Even with modern treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, used alone or together, patients typically survive a median of only about 15 months.

In the new study, published in BJC Reports, Professor Mittra and colleagues enrolled ten patients with glioblastoma and asked them to take a tablet containing small amounts of two nutraceuticals, resveratrol and copper. They took this tablet four times a day for an average of 11.6 days before their scheduled brain surgery.

Another group of ten patients, whose tumors were similarly aggressive but who did not receive resveratrol and copper, served as the control group.

During surgery, the team collected brain tumor samples from both groups. These samples were then examined in detail using microscopy, immune-staining, immunofluorescence and transcriptome analysis to see how the tumors differed.

The analyses showed that the nutraceutical tablets had a striking effect on tumor biology.

Dramatic Changes Inside the Tumors

Several key cancer markers shifted in a favorable direction in patients who received the resveratrol and copper tablets:

Crucially, the patients who took the nutraceutical tablets did not experience any side-effects.

""These results suggest that a simple, inexpensive and non-toxic nutraceutical tablet potentially has the power to heal glioblastoma,"" said Professor Mittra.

Targeting Cell-Free Chromatin Particles (cfChPs)

So how might this apparent healing happen at the cellular level?

According to Professor Mittra, the key action involves resveratrol and copper acting on cell-free chromatin particles (cfChPs) (cfChPs) that circulate in the body. These are fragments of DNA released from dying cancer cells that can worsen the behavior of surviving cancer cells.

Earlier work from his group showed that when resveratrol and copper are combined, they generate oxygen radicals that deactivate or destroy cfChPs.

In the current study, the researchers found that cfChPs were abundant in tissue taken from untreated tumors, but were almost completely absent from tissue taken from tumors in patients who had received the nutraceutical tablets.

The findings suggest that dead cancer cells in the treated group were removed through apoptosis, a controlled cell death process, before they could release cfChPs into the surrounding environment.

Professor Mittra explains: ""The cell-free chromatin particles, fragments of DNA released by dying cancer cells, inflame the surviving cancer cells. This makes the disease more aggressive.

""If you eliminate the cell-free chromatin, which is what the resveratrol-copper tablets do, the cancer is subdued.""

He adds that with longer-term use, this approach might possibly lead to complete healing of the cancer, effectively turning a malignant tumor into a benign one.

Immune Checkpoints and a Low Cost Alternative

One of the most notable findings from the study is that the resveratrol-copper tablets reduced the activity of several immune checkpoints. Immune checkpoint inhibition has been hailed as a breakthrough in cancer therapy, because blocking these proteins can unleash the immune system against tumors. However, current immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs are extremely expensive and can cause significant side-effects.

In contrast, the nutraceutical combination used in this study is simple, non-toxic and inexpensive, yet still appears to downregulate multiple immune checkpoints. This raises the possibility of a more accessible way to influence some of the same pathways targeted by costly cancer drugs.

A Potential Shift in Cancer Treatment

A new approach to treating cancer has begun to emerge from these observations.

""We have been trying to kill cancer cells for 2,500 years, since the time of the ancient Greeks, without success,"" says Professor Mittra.

""Maybe it is time to look at cancer treatment differently and work towards healing tumors, rather than annihilating them.

""Of course, the number of patients in this study was rather small. However, the results were so striking that I'd fully expect them to be replicated in a larger sample of patients.

""I believe that we may be on the brink of transforming the way cancer is treated.""

Professor Indraneel Mittra is Dr. Ernest Borges Chair in Translational Research and Professor Emeritus in the Department of Surgical Oncology at the Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer (ACTREC), Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai.

This study was supported by the Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India, through its grant CTCTMC to the Tata Memorial Centre awarded to Indraneel Mittra.

A new brain implant could significantly reshape how people interact with computers while offering new treatment possibilities for conditions such as epilepsy, spinal cord injury, ALS, stroke, and blindness. By creating a minimally invasive, high-throughput communication path to the brain, it has the potential to support seizure control and help restore motor, speech, and visual abilities.

The promise of this technology comes from its extremely small size paired with its ability to transmit data at very high speeds. Developed through a collaboration between Columbia University, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Stanford University, and the University of Pennsylvania, the device is a brain-computer interface (BCI) built around a single silicon chip. This chip forms a wireless, high-bandwidth link between the brain and external computers. The system is known as the Biological Interface System to Cortex (BISC).

A study published Dec. 8 in Nature Electronics outlines BISC's architecture, which includes the chip-based implant, a wearable ""relay station,"" and the software needed to run the platform. ""Most implantable systems are built around a canister of electronics that occupies enormous volumes of space inside the body,"" says Ken Shepard, Lau Family Professor of Electrical Engineering, professor of biomedical engineering, and professor of neurological sciences at Columbia University, who served as one of the senior authors and led the engineering work. ""Our implant is a single integrated circuit chip that is so thin that it can slide into the space between the brain and the skull, resting on the brain like a piece of wet tissue paper.""

Transforming the Cortex Into a High-Bandwidth Interface

Shepard worked closely with senior and co-corresponding author Andreas S. Tolias, PhD, professor at the Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University and co-founding director of the Enigma Project. Tolias's extensive experience training AI systems on large-scale neural recordings, including those collected with BISC, helped the team analyze how well the implant could decode brain activity. ""BISC turns the cortical surface into an effective portal, delivering high-bandwidth, minimally invasive read-write communication with AI and external devices,"" Tolias says. ""Its single-chip scalability paves the way for adaptive neuroprosthetics and brain-AI interfaces to treat many neuropsychiatric disorders, such as epilepsy.""

Dr. Brett Youngerman, assistant professor of neurological surgery at Columbia University and neurosurgeon at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, served as the project's main clinical collaborator. ""This high-resolution, high-data-throughput device has the potential to revolutionize the management of neurological conditions from epilepsy to paralysis,"" he says. Youngerman, Shepard, and NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia epilepsy neurologist Dr. Catherine Schevon recently secured a National Institutes of Health grant to use BISC in treating drug-resistant epilepsy. ""The key to effective brain-computer interface devices is to maximize the information flow to and from the brain, while making the device as minimally invasive in its surgical implantation as possible. BISC surpasses previous technology on both fronts,"" Youngerman adds.

""Semiconductor technology has made this possible, allowing the computing power of room-sized computers to now fit in your pocket,"" Shepard says. ""We are now doing the same for medical implantables, allowing complex electronics to exist in the body while taking up almost no space.""

Next-Generation BCI Engineering

BCIs function by connecting with the electrical signals used by neurons to communicate. Current medical-grade BCIs typically rely on multiple separate microelectronic components, such as amplifiers, data converters, and radio transmitters. These parts must be stored in a relatively large implanted canister, placed either by removing part of the skull or in another part of the body like the chest, with wires extending to the brain.

BISC is built differently. The entire system resides on a single complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit that has been thinned to 50 μm and occupies less than 1/1000th the volume of a standard implant. With a total size of about 3 mm3, the flexible chip can curve to match the brain's surface. This micro-electrocorticography (µECoG) device contains 65,536 electrodes, 1,024 recording channels, and 16,384 stimulation channels. Because the chip is produced using semiconductor industry manufacturing methods, it is suitable for large-scale production.

The chip integrates a radio transceiver, a wireless power circuit, digital control electronics, power management, data converters, and the analog components necessary for both recording and stimulation. The external relay station provides power and data communication through a custom ultrawideband radio link that reaches 100 Mbps, a throughput at least 100 times higher than any other wireless BCI currently available. Operating as an 802.11 WiFi device, the relay station effectively bridges any computer to the implant.

BISC incorporates its own instruction set along with a comprehensive software environment, forming a specialized computing system for brain interfaces. The high-bandwidth recording demonstrated in this study allows brain signals to be processed by advanced machine-learning and deep-learning algorithms, which can interpret complex intentions, perceptual experiences, and brain states.

""By integrating everything on one piece of silicon, we've shown how brain interfaces can become smaller, safer, and dramatically more powerful,"" Shepard says.

Advanced Semiconductor Fabrication

The BISC implant was fabricated using TSMC's 0.13-μm Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) technology. This fabrication method combines three semiconductor technologies into one chip to produce mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs). It allows digital logic (from CMOS), high-current and high-voltage analog functions (from bipolar and DMOS transistors), and power devices (from DMOS) to work together efficiently, all of which are essential for BISC's performance.

Moving From the Lab Toward Clinical Use

To transition the system into real-world medical use, Shepard's group partnered with Youngerman at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center. They developed surgical procedures to place the thin implant safely in a preclinical model and confirmed that the device produced high-quality, stable recordings. Short-term intraoperative studies in human patients are already underway.

""These initial studies give us invaluable data about how the device performs in a real surgical setting,"" Youngerman says. ""The implants can be inserted through a minimally invasive incision in the skull and slid directly onto the surface of the brain in the subdural space. The paper-thin form factor and lack of brain-penetrating electrodes or wires tethering the implant to the skull minimize tissue reactivity and signal degradation over time.""

Extensive preclinical work in the motor and visual cortices was carried out with Dr. Tolias and Bijan Pesaran, professor of neurosurgery at the University of Pennsylvania, both recognized leaders in computational and systems neuroscience.

""The extreme miniaturization by BISC is very exciting as a platform for new generations of implantable technologies that also interface with the brain with other modalities such as light and sound,"" Pesaran says.

BISC was developed through the Neural Engineering System Design program of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and draws on Columbia's deep expertise in microelectronics, the advanced neuroscience programs at Stanford and Penn, and the surgical capabilities of NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center.

Commercial Development and Future AI Integration

To move the technology closer to practical use, researchers at Columbia and Stanford created Kampto Neurotech, a startup founded by Columbia electrical engineering alumnus Dr. Nanyu Zeng, one of the project's lead engineers. The company is producing research-ready versions of the chip and working to secure funding to prepare the system for use in human patients.

""This is a fundamentally different way of building BCI devices,"" Zeng says. ""In this way, BISC has technological capabilities that exceed those of competing devices by many orders of magnitude.""

As artificial intelligence continues to advance, BCIs are gaining momentum both for restoring lost abilities in people with neurological disorders and for potential future applications that enhance normal function through direct brain-to-computer communication.

""By combining ultra-high resolution neural recording with fully wireless operation, and pairing that with advanced decoding and stimulation algorithms, we are moving toward a future where the brain and AI systems can interact seamlessly -- not just for research, but for human benefit,"" Shepard says. ""This could change how we treat brain disorders, how we interface with machines, and ultimately how humans engage with AI.""

Researchers have carried out the first investigation of how obesity affects Alzheimer's disease blood biomarkers (BBMs). In this work, BBM levels rose up to 95% more quickly in people with obesity than in people without obesity, based on findings presented at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

""This is the first time we've shown the relationship between obesity and Alzheimer's disease as measured by blood biomarker tests,"" said Cyrus Raji, M.D., Ph.D., senior author of the study and a principal investigator in the Neuroimaging Labs Research Center at Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology (MIR) at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.

Long-Term Brain Imaging and Blood Data

To explore this connection, the team drew on five years of data from 407 volunteers enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, which provided both amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scans and blood samples. PET scans are used to show the brain's amyloid burden, meaning the buildup of beta-amyloid protein in the brain as amyloid plaques, a key feature of Alzheimer's disease.

Researchers analyzed plasma samples for several BBMs related to Alzheimer's disease, including pTau217 levels (a biomarker used in the diagnosis and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease), neurofilament light chain (NfL) -- a protein fragment released from damaged or dying neurons -- and plasma GFAP -- a protein expressed primarily in astrocytes (cells that support and protect neurons in the brain and spinal cord) using six leading commercial tests.

Linking Body Weight to Brain Biomarkers

The research team used statistical methods to examine how these BBMs related to body mass index (BMI) and to evaluate a three-way interaction between baseline obesity, time and BBMs. They also compared and confirmed the BBM results against the amyloid PET scan findings.

When they combined the blood and imaging data, they found that at the start of the study, higher BMI was linked to lower BBM levels and a lower overall amyloid burden across the brain.

""We believe the reduced BBMs in obese individuals was due to dilution from the higher blood volume,"" said study lead author Soheil Mohammadi, M.D., M.P.H., postdoctoral research associate at MIR. ""In fact, by relying on the baseline measurements, you could be fooled into thinking that the people with obesity had a lower pathology of Alzheimer's disease. We need the longitudinal data to fully understand the how obesity impacts the development of Alzheimer's pathology.""

A longitudinal study involves repeatedly collecting data from the same group over an extended period, tracking changes and trends over a period of time.

Obesity Speeds Up Alzheimer's-Related Changes

As the years passed, both Alzheimer's disease BBMs and brain PET scans showed a greater build-up of Alzheimer's-related pathology in participants with obesity compared with those without obesity. People with obesity experienced a 29% to 95% faster increase in plasma pTau217 ratio levels. Having obesity at baseline was also associated with a 24% faster rise in plasma NfL and a 3.7% faster increase in amyloid accumulation.

Dr. Raji noted that their results showed blood tests offered greater sensitivity than PET scans for detecting the influence of obesity on Alzheimer's-related brain changes.

""The fact that we can track the predictive influence of obesity on rising blood biomarkers more sensitively than PET is what astonished me in this study,"" he said.

Clinical Implications and Modifiable Risk

According to Dr. Mohammadi, the way obesity shapes the progression of amyloid burden and related shifts in Alzheimer's blood biomarkers has important implications for how clinicians assess and manage risk.

""According to the 2024 report of the Lancet Commission, 14 modifiable risk factors total approximately 45%, or close to half, of the risk for Alzheimer's disease,"" he said. ""If we can reduce any of those risk factors, we can significantly reduce Alzheimer's cases or lengthen the amount of time until the onset of the disease.""

Future of Brain Health Monitoring and Treatment

Dr. Raji anticipates that repeated measurements of blood biomarkers, combined with brain imaging, will increasingly be used to track treatment strategies involving anti-amyloid drugs.

""This is such profound science to follow right now because we have drugs that can treat obesity quite powerfully, which means we could track the effect of weight loss drugs on Alzheimer's biomarkers in future studies,"" he said. ""It's marvelous that we have these blood biomarkers to track the molecular pathology of Alzheimer's disease, and MRI scans to track additional evidence of brain degeneration and response to various treatments. This work is foundational for future studies and treatment trials.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A hidden mechanism changes what we know about cell division","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251209043057.htm","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 14:21:08 GMT","

Scientists at the Ruđer Bošković Institute (RBI) in Zagreb, Croatia, have uncovered a surprising function for the protein CENP-E. For years, it was thought to act like a motor that pulled wandering chromosomes into position as a cell prepared to divide. The new findings reveal something completely different: CENP-E stabilizes the very first connections between chromosomes and the cell's internal ""tracks,"" helping them line up properly before the cell splits.

A companion study showed that centromeres, small structures on chromosomes once believed to work on their own, play a guiding role in directing CENP-E so it can help the division process unfold correctly. Together, these results overturn two decades of accepted teaching and carry major implications, since mistakes in chromosome attachment are linked to many cancers and genetic disorders.

Why Early Chromosome Positioning Matters

Every moment, in countless cells across the body, division takes place with extraordinary precision. A single cell duplicates three billion DNA letters and manages to distribute perfect copies to both daughter cells.

When that delicate process fails, the consequences can be serious. Even one chromosome in the wrong place can disrupt development, contribute to infertility, or trigger cancer. Cell division offers little room for error.

For many years, researchers believed they understood one of the central players: CENP-E, often described as a motor protein that hauled stray chromosomes toward the middle of the dividing cell. The idea was simple, widely taught, and ultimately incorrect.

Researchers Uncover a Different Role for CENP-E

Two studies from RBI, published in Nature Communications and led by Dr. Kruno Vukušić and Professor Iva Tolić, break down the earlier model and present a new explanation. Dr. Vukušić trained as a postdoctoral researcher within a highly selective ERC Synergy team and is now preparing to lead his own group at RBI. Prof. Tolić, a recognized global expert in cell biophysics and head of the Laboratory for Cell Biophysics at RBI, holds two ERC grants and is a member of EMBO and Academia Europaea. Their work shows that CENP-E is not the ""muscle"" dragging chromosomes into place but a key regulator that activates at the right moment to allow everything else to fall into line.

""CENP-E is not the engine pulling chromosomes to the center,"" Vukušić says. ""It is the factor that ensures they can attach properly in the first place. Without that initial stabilization, the system stalls.""

Chromosome Movement as a City of Traffic

Picture a huge city at peak traffic. Millions of vehicles fill countless intersections, and a single mistake can stop the entire flow.

Now imagine this scene scaled down to the inside of a cell. Chromosomes act like trains carrying DNA cargo, and microtubules form the rails guiding them. For division to succeed, each chromosome must connect to the correct set of tracks and move into position at the center.

The long-standing model cast CENP-E as the locomotive pulling lagging chromosomes into place. The Zagreb team found a more precise function. Instead of the engine, CENP-E behaves like a coupling that secures the link between a chromosome and the microtubule. When that coupling is weak or missing, the trains stall at the station's outskirts and cannot advance.

What Controls When Chromosomes Move

Why do some chromosomes pause at the edges of the cell? The answer involves Aurora kinases, a group of proteins that operate like strict traffic lights. They generate strong ""red"" signals that prevent chromosomes from making incorrect early attachments.

This system protects against mistakes near the poles of the cell, but it can also hold chromosomes back too aggressively. CENP-E helps restore balance by adjusting those signals so that the first proper connections can form. Once that initial stable attachment appears, alignment follows naturally through the geometry of the spindle and the behavior of microtubules.

""It's not about brute force,"" Tolić explains. ""It's about creating the conditions for the system to run smoothly. CENP-E's key role is to stabilize the start, and once that happens, the rest of mitosis unfolds correctly.""

Rethinking a Long-Standing Textbook Model

For almost twenty years, textbooks described CENP-E as a motor that pulled chromosomes to the metaphase plate. The new research contradicts that view.

""Congression, the alignment of chromosomes, is intrinsically linked to biorientation,"" says Tolić. ""What we show is that CENP-E doesn't contribute significantly to the movement itself. Its crucial role is stabilizing end-on attachments at the start. That is what allows the system to proceed correctly.""

This shift replaces a force-based explanation with one focused on regulation and timing. The implications stretch far beyond classroom learning.

Why This Discovery Matters for Human Health

To someone outside the field, the distinction may appear small. In cell biology, small shifts often reveal major truths. Errors in chromosome segregation are a hallmark of cancer. Tumor cells commonly show duplicated or missing chromosome segments, and these abnormalities often trace back to mistakes in the attachment process.

By demonstrating that CENP-E regulates the earliest attachments and by connecting this regulation to Aurora kinase activity, the Zagreb team linked two processes previously thought to act separately. This connection exposes a potential weak point in dividing cells and may point the way toward therapies that correct or slow dangerous divisions.

""This isn't just about rewriting a model,"" Vukušić says. ""It's about identifying a mechanism that directly links to disease. That opens doors for diagnostics and for thinking about new therapies.""

Support From Europe and Croatia

The research was made possible through significant competitive funding, including the European Research Council's Synergy Grant, the Croatian Science Foundation, Swiss Croatian bilateral projects, and EU development programs.

The work also depended on advanced computing resources at the University of Zagreb's SRCE center. ""Modern biology isn't just microscopes and test tubes,"" Tolić says. ""It's also computation and collaboration across disciplines and borders.""

Finding Structure in Cellular Complexity

At its core, the discovery sheds light on how cells maintain order amid constant motion. Trillions of cell divisions occur daily in the human body, and each event must fight against the natural pull of disorder. The new understanding from Zagreb helps reveal one of the hidden strategies behind that consistency. By reinterpreting the role of CENP-E and connecting it to other cellular regulators, the team has added clarity to a process that operates under immense pressure.

""By uncovering how these microscopic regulators cooperate,"" Tolić says, ""we are not only deepening our understanding of biology but also moving closer to correcting the failures that underlie disease.""

Fire-making is a uniquely human innovation that stands apart from other complex behaviours such as tool production, symbolic culture and social communication. Controlled fire use provided adaptive opportunities that had profound effects on human evolution. Benefits included warmth, protection from predators, cooking and creation of illuminated spaces that became focal points for social interaction1,2,3. Fire use developed over a million years, progressing from harvesting natural fire to maintaining and ultimately making fire4. However, determining when and how fire use evolved is challenging because natural and anthropogenic burning are hard to distinguish5,6,7. Although geochemical methods have improved interpretations of heated deposits, unequivocal evidence of deliberate fire-making has remained elusive. Here we present evidence of fire-making on a 400,000-year-old buried landsurface at Barnham (UK), where heated sediments and fire-cracked flint handaxes were found alongside two fragments of iron pyrite—a mineral used in later periods to strike sparks with flint. Geological studies show that pyrite is locally rare, suggesting it was brought deliberately to the site for fire-making. The emergence of this technological capability provided important social and adaptive benefits, including the ability to cook food on demand—particularly meat—thereby enhancing digestibility and energy availability, which may have been crucial for hominin brain evolution3.

Psychiatric disorders display high levels of comorbidity and genetic overlap1,2, challenging current diagnostic boundaries. For disorders for which diagnostic separation has been most debated, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder3, genomic methods have revealed that the majority of genetic signal is shared4. While over a hundred pleiotropic loci have been identified by recent cross-disorder analyses5, the full scope of shared and disorder-specific genetic influences remains poorly defined. Here we addressed this gap by triangulating across a suite of cutting-edge statistical and functional genomic analyses applied to 14 childhood- and adult-onset psychiatric disorders (1,056,201 cases). Using genetic association data from common variants, we identified and characterized five underlying genomic factors that explained the majority of the genetic variance of the individual disorders (around 66% on average) and were associated with 238 pleiotropic loci. The two factors defined by (1) Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders (SB factor); and (2) major depression, PTSD and anxiety (Internalizing factor) showed high levels of polygenic overlap6 and local genetic correlation and very few disorder-specific loci. The genetic signal shared across all 14 disorders was enriched for broad biological processes (for example, transcriptional regulation), while more specific pathways were shared at the level of the individual factors. The shared genetic signal across the SB factor was substantially enriched in genes expressed in excitatory neurons, whereas the Internalizing factor was associated with oligodendrocyte biology. These observations may inform a more neurobiologically valid psychiatric nosology and implicate targets for therapeutic development designed to treat commonly occurring comorbid presentations.

Half of the population will meet criteria for at least one psychiatric disorder during their lifetime7, with many meeting criteria for multiple disorders1. High levels of psychiatric comorbidity complicate efforts to differentiate among psychiatric disorders. These challenges are heightened because psychiatric disorders are defined by signs and symptoms, as the underlying pathophysiologies remain largely unclear. Rapid progress in psychiatric genomics has identified hundreds of associated loci (genetic variants), many of which exhibit pleiotropic (shared) associations across disorders, and revealed high correlations in genetic liability across disorders8.

The present analyses represent the third major study from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Cross-Disorder working group9 (CDG3). Here we examined the shared and unique influences of common genetic variants across 14 psychiatric disorders. Triangulating across multiple, complementary analytic approaches, we dissected the genetic architecture across disorders at the genome-wide, regional, functional and individual genetic variant levels. Our results have implications for refining clinical nosology and repurposing and developing novel treatments.

A summary of the datasets is provided in Extended Data Table 1. Psychiatric disorders were included if described in a psychiatric diagnostic manual10,11 and power was sufficient to interpret genetic correlations4. This reflects a major update relative to previous CDG1 (ref. 12) and CDG2 (ref. 5) analyses (average case increase of around 165% above CDG2; Supplementary Fig. 1), with new genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for all eight disorders from CDG2: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anorexia nervosa (AN), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BIP), major depression (MD), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), schizophrenia (SCZ) and Tourette's syndrome (TS)13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20. We added six additional disorders: alcohol-use disorder (AUD)21, anxiety disorders (ANX)22, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)23, nicotine dependence assessed using the Fagerström test for nicotine dependence (NIC)24, opioid-use disorder (OUD)25 and cannabis-use disorder (CUD)26. The three substance-use disorders (SUDs) are novel relative to a more recent cross-disorder analysis27, and sample size increases were significant for previously included disorders (average case increase of around 287%). The sample sizes, and therefore the power of the disorder GWAS, differed (Extended Data Table 1 (Neffective)).

Owing to an uneven representation of ancestral groups, the full set of cross-disorder analyses was restricted to GWAS summary statistics from a single genetic ancestry group—European-like (EUR-like)—defined on the basis of genetic similarity to European descent in global reference panels28. We also report bivariate results for MD29 and SCZ30 in East-Asian-like (EAS-like) genetic ancestry groups and AUD31, CUD26, OUD25 and PTSD23 in African-like (AFR-like) genetic ancestry groups similarly defined based on reference panels.

Genetic correlations (rgs) estimated using linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression (LDSC)4 revealed pervasive genetic overlap across disorders at the genome-wide level, with clusters of disorders demonstrating particularly high genetic overlap in individuals of EUR-like genetic ancestry (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 1; see Supplementary Figs. 2–4 for consideration of high rg across PTSD and MD). The LDSC estimates within AFR-like participants were not significant, due to limited power (Supplementary Table 4). The rg between MD and SCZ in EAS-like participants (rg = 0.45, s.e. = 0.09) was double that observed in EUR-like participants (rg = 0.22, s.e. = 0.04), which has been shown29 to be driven by a single cohort of severe and recurrent MD32.

a, Heatmap of rgs across the 14 disorders as estimated using LDSC on the lower diagonal and the correlations among the psychiatric factors as estimated using GenomicSEM above the diagonal. Two-sided P values were derived from the Z-statistics, calculated as the point estimate of the rg divided by its s.e. Cells depicted with an asterisk reflect values that were significant at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold for multiple comparisons. Exact values are reported in Supplementary Table 1. Disorders that load on the same factor are shown in the same colour. Per the legend at the bottom of the panel, darker blue shading indicates larger, positive rgs. LDSC estimates were used as the input to genomic SEM to produce the results in b and c. b, Estimates from the five-factor model along with standard errors in parentheses. Estimates are standardized relative to SNP-based heritabilities, where this is equal to the sum of the squared factor loading (the single-headed arrow(s) from the factor to the disorder) and the residual variance (the values on the double-headed arrows on the single-colour circles with text labels that begin with u). Disorders are shown as pie charts; the proportion of residual variance is shaded in purple and the variance explained by the psychiatric factors is shaded in the colour of the corresponding factor. c, Standardized estimates from the p-factor model. The disorders are colour coded as in b, and the first-order factors (F1–F5) are also colour coded to show variance explained by the second-order p-factor in yellow.

As the majority of analyses were restricted to participants of EUR-like genetic ancestry, we sought to gauge how generalizable our findings were across ancestral groups. We achieved this using Popcorn33, which can estimate rgs for the same trait across ancestral groups. We estimated the genetic impact correlation (ρgi), which considers different allele frequencies across populations by calculating the correlation between the population-specific, allele-variance-normalized single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effect sizes. The results were underpowered for many comparisons, but included a strong EAS–EUR correlation for SCZ (ρgi = 0.85, s.e. = 0.04), followed by lower correlations between EAS-like and EUR-like for MD (ρgi = 0.67, s.e. = 0.16) and for AFR-like and EUR-like PTSD (ρgi = 0.59, s.e. = 0.27; Supplementary Table 4). While these results suggest that the findings that follow for EUR-like ancestry groups may generalize better for some disorders (such as SCZ) than for others (for example, PTSD and MD), that conclusion awaits replication in more highly powered analyses.

Genome-wide rgs from LDSC indicate shared genetic risk across psychiatric disorders. However, LDSC may underestimate the extent of genetic overlap if shared causal variants reflect a mixture of directionally concordant and discordant associations. We applied bivariate causal mixture modelling (MiXeR) to quantify the degree of genome-wide polygenic overlap reflecting the total number of shared causal variants regardless of magnitude or directionality6. Cross-trait analyses were limited to MD, SCZ, BIP, ANX, ADHD, PTSD, AUD and AN, because other disorders were underpowered (Methods; results for univariate MiXeR are reported in Supplementary Table 5 and Extended Data Fig. 1). Supplementary Fig. 5 displays cross-trait MiXeR results for pairwise overlap across four particularly well-powered disorder samples: ADHD, SCZ, BIP and MD (complete results are shown in Supplementary Figs. 6–9 and Supplementary Table 6). There was greater polygenic overlap across psychiatric disorders than suggested by the rgs from LDSC. Overall, MiXeR results suggested that the shared genetic signal for psychiatric disorders primarily reflects variants with concordant effects across disorders, while differentiation in genetic risk is driven by fewer shared discordant or unique variants.

We used genomic structural equation modelling (genomic SEM)27,34 in the EUR-like genetic ancestry datasets to model genetic overlap from LDSC across 14 disorders as latent factors representing dimensions of shared genetic risk (Methods). A five-factor model (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3) provided the best fit to the data (comparative fix index (CFI) = 0.971, standard root mean square residual (SRMR) = 0.063). These five latent genomic factors (capitalized throughout, to distinguish them from the psychiatric disorders that define them) (Fig. 1) comprised: F1, a Compulsive disorders factor defined by AN, OCD and, more weakly, TS and ANX; F2, a SB factor defined by SCZ and BIP; F3, a Neurodevelopmental factor defined by ASD, ADHD and, more weakly, TS; F4, an Internalizing disorders factor defined by PTSD, MD and ANX; and F5, a SUD factor defined by OUD, CUD, AUD, NIC and, to a lesser extent, ADHD.

Within this five-factor model, Internalizing disorders and SUD factors displayed the highest interfactor correlation (rg = 0.60; s.e. = 0.02). The median residual genetic variance unexplained by the latent factors was 33.5%, indicating that most genetic risk was shared among disorder subsets. TS displayed the most unique genetic signal, with 87% of its genetic variance unexplained by the factors. The structure of the first four factors was similar to that found by genomic SEM applied to subsets of these disorders in previous work5,27, indicating stability in the underlying factor structure, even as sample sizes and the number of disorders have increased. The newly added SUD traits formed the fifth factor.

Evidence of moderate rg between factors suggests that a higher-order factor may explain common variance across the correlated factors. Consistent with this observation, a hierarchical model also fit the data well (CFI = 0.959, SRMR = 0.074). We refer to this as the p-factor model, which included a higher-order general psychopathology factor defined by the five lower-order psychiatric factors (such as SUD). Internalizing loaded most strongly on p (0.95), with the other 4 factors having moderate loadings (0.50–0.63).

As some of the underlying data were obtained using brief, self-reported diagnoses, we performed a sensitivity analysis in which those data were excluded (Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Tables 7–11 and Supplementary Figs. 10–18). The rg matrix was largely unchanged; the five-factor model identified in the full sample continued to provide good fit to the data and produced similar point estimates, and downstream GWAS analyses (detailed below) identified similar loci.

We estimated rgs between the five correlated factors, hierarchical p-factor and 31 complex traits (Supplementary Table 12) to place shared genetic liability indexed by the factors in a broader clinical context. These factors vary in their use for capturing shared genetic signal; accordingly, we used the QTrait heterogeneity statistic to assess this use at the genome-wide level. When QTrait is significant, this indicates a trait's rg deviates from the factor structure. For example, if trait X is negatively correlated with SCZ but unrelated to BIP, QTrait would probably be significant, suggesting that trait X lies outside the shared signal captured by the factor. Significant correlations were defined at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of P < 2.68 × 10−4, while not significant for QTrait at this same threshold. This QTrait exclusion criteria was relaxed for the p-factor if that trait was significantly associated with the majority (≥3) of the five correlated factors, as this indicates the trait is capturing transdiagnostic associations the p-factor is intended to index.

The Internalizing disorders and SUD factors were the only factors associated with household income (rg_Internalizing = −0.40, s.e. = 0.02; rg_SUD = −0.41, s.e. = 0.03; Fig. 2) and were the most pervasively associated with different cognitive outcomes, including childhood intelligence (rg_Internalizing = −0.27, s.e. = 0.05; rg_SUD = −0.40, s.e. = 0.07). Only the SUD factor was associated with adult intelligence (rg_SUD = −0.40, s.e. = 0.03) and verbal numerical reasoning (rg_SUD = −0.41, s.e. = 0.03). This was compared to more circumscribed cognitive associations for the Compulsive disorders and SB factors, including a large negative correlation with the pairs matching test (potentially indexing memory; rg_Compulsive = −0.33, s.e. = 0.03; rg_SB = −0.34, s.e. = 0.03). The SB and SUD factors were the only ones associated with risk tolerance (rg_SB = 0.31, s.e. = 0.03; rg_SUD = 0.38, s.e. = 0.03). The Neurodevelopmental factor was uniquely associated with childhood BMI (rg_Neurodevelopmental = 0.26, s.e. = 0.06) and showed high genetic overlap with childhood aggression (rg_Neurodevelopmental = 0.94, s.e. = 0.10). As would be expected, the five traits significantly associated with all five correlated factors were also among the top correlations for the p-factor, reflecting stress sensitivity (rg_p = 0.50, s.e. = 0.02), loneliness (rg_p = 0.62, s.e. = 0.02), neuroticism (rg_p = 0.64, s.e. = 0.02), self-harm (rg_p = 0.74, s.e. = 0.04) and suicide attempts (rg_p = 0.87, s.e. = 0.03). The full set of correlations is shown in Supplementary Table 13; comparison across factors is shown in Extended Data Fig. 2; and comparison across traits within each factor is shown in Extended Data Fig. 3.

Point estimates for the rgs between 14 external traits and the 5 psychiatric factors from the correlated factors model and the p-factor from the hierarchical model. These traits were selected as they were significantly correlated with at least one factor at >0.35 or <−0.35. Bars depicted with a dashed outline were significant for the QTrait heterogeneity statistic, which indicates that the pattern of rgs for that trait did not fit the factor structure. Bars depicted with an asterisk reflect values that were significant at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold for multiple comparisons, that were also not significant at this same Bonferroni corrected threshold for QTrait. This is with the exception that the p-factor is depicted with an asterisk even if it is significant for the QTrait, provided that the same trait was significantly correlated with the majority (at least three) of the five other factors. The two-sided P values used to evaluate significance were derived from the Z-statistics, calculated as the point estimate of the rg divided by its s.e. Error bars are ±1.96 s.e., centred around the point estimate of the rgs. Traits are ordered by the point estimate for the p-factor. The implied sample size for the psychiatric factors was: Compulsive (\(\hat{n}\) = 54,100), SB (\(\hat{n}\) = 127,202), Neurodevelopmental (\(\hat{n}\)  = 84,760), Internalizing (\(\hat{n}\) = 1,637,337), SUD (\(\hat{n}\) = 313,395) and p-factor (\(\hat{n}\) = 2,168,621). Sample sizes for the external traits are reported in Supplementary Table 12 and exact P values are reported in Supplementary Table 13.

Global estimates of pleiotropy, such as the genome-wide rgs from LDSC, provide an average of the degree of shared signal across the genome. However, as genetic overlap is unlikely to be constant across genomic regions, we segmented the genome into 1,093 LD-independent regions, and applied local analysis of (co)variant association (LAVA35; Methods) to assess the rg between disorders within these regions. In addition to capturing heterogeneity in genetic overlap and pinpointing relevant regions, LAVA identifies potential rg hotspots shared among several disorders, thereby providing further insight into genetic architecture.

We restricted analyses to loci with sufficient SNP-based heritability for the disorders analysed (P < 4.6 × 10−5 = 0.05/1,093; Methods). Correcting for the number of bivariate tests performed across all regions and disorder pairs, we detected 458 significant pairwise local rgs (P < 2.1 × 10−6 = 0.05/24,273). The pairs of disorders with the greatest number of local rg hits were MD and ANX (113 regions), MD and PTSD (88 regions), and BIP and SCZ (40 regions), accounting for over half of all significant local rgs detected (Fig. 3a). This is consistent with the genome-wide levels of overlap indicated through the LDSC global rg (Fig. 1), the polygenic overlap estimated with MiXeR (Supplementary Figs. 5–9), and the multivariate genetic structure identified by genomic SEM. Both global and local rgs tended to be positive, with significant negative rgs identified in only three instances (Supplementary Fig. 19). This indicates that the genetic risk for one disorder typically increases the risk for another (Supplementary Fig. 20).

a, An overview of the average patterns of local rgs across the genome for all pairs of disorders, shown as a heatmap (below diagonal) and a network plot (above diagonal). The colours of the heatmap represent the average local rgs across all evaluated loci, with darker red and blue shading indicating more negative and positive rg, respectively; the dot size reflects the strengths of average associations; and the numbers indicate how many of the local rgs were significant. These results are mirrored in the network plot, where the width or the edges reflect the number of significant associations, meaning that only disorders with at least one significant local rg are connected, and the edge opacity reflects the strength of the average local rg across tested loci. Note that label colours are concordant with the genomic SEM factor structure from Fig. 1 and, as shown, disorders of similar colours also tend to be proximally located within the network. b, The local rg structure within the top rg hotspot on chromosome (chr.) 11 (112755447–114742317, GRCh37 reference genome), that is, the region where the greatest number of significant rgs were found across all disorder pairs. Here, the network plot illustrates all significant rgs detected in this region, with both edge width and opacity reflecting the strength of the association. The region plot in the middle displays the genes contained within the hotspot, and the table below shows the rg estimates (Rho), 95% confidence intervals (CIlower, CIupper), variance explained (R2) and P values for all significant pairwise local rgs in this region. Label colours are again concordant with those used for the genomic SEM factor structure in Fig. 1.

We detected 101 regions that contained significant local rgs between several disorder pairs, which we call rg hotspots (see Supplementary Tables 14–23 for local rgs across disorders in the top 10 hotspots). The most pleiotropic of these hotspots was on chromosome 11, which contained 17 positive and significant local rgs involving 8 of the 14 analysed disorders (Fig. 3b). This region also stands out as the most significantly associated with 8 of these 17 disorder pairs, while ranking in the top 25% of associated loci for 12 of them (Supplementary Fig. 21). Notably, this region contains the NCAM1–TTC12–ANKK1–DRD2 gene cluster that has been frequently associated with psychiatric phenotypes36,37,38,39, and flagged as a likely pleiotropy hotspot for a range of cognitive and behavioural outcomes related to, for example, intelligence, personality, substance use and sleep35,40,41,42.

We used multivariate GWAS within genomic SEM34 to identify SNPs associated with the factors from the five-factor model or the p-factor in the hierarchical model. Similar to the QTrait metric, we estimated factor-specific QSNP heterogeneity statistics. This indexes SNPs that deviate strongly from the factor structure, due to either disorder-specific or directionally discordant effects. We defined genomic hits for the factors as those that were significant after Bonferroni correction (P < 5 × 10−8/6 genomic factors) and did not overlap with QSNP hits for that factor (Methods). Most hits were identified for the SB (n = 102) and Internalizing (n = 150) factors. After merging overlapping loci across the five correlated factors, 238 unique hits remained, including 27 broadly pleiotropic loci associated with two or more factors. The hierarchical model identified 160 hits for the p-factor (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 22 and Supplementary Tables 24–36), 57 of which were not identified in the five-factor model (295 unique hits across both models). Forty-eight hits were novel relative to the univariate GWAS, of which 38 have been described in previous GWAS for a broad range of outcomes, and 10 are entirely novel (Supplementary Table 37).

a, Heatmap of CC-GWAS loci below the diagonal across pairwise combinations of disorders; the darker orange shading indicates a higher number of CC-GWAS hits. CC-GWAS results are not shown for the Internalizing disorders as their rgs were too high, or for nicotine dependence as this is a continuously measured trait. Genomic SEM results (number of hits and mean χ2 for each factor and factor-specific QSNP estimate) are reported above the diagonal. Results for the p-factor are shown above the plot along with a Venn diagram of the overlap between p-factor, p-factor QSNP and overall CC-GWAS hits. The disorders are ordered and coloured according to the genomic SEM factor structure from Fig. 1. b,c, The Miami and QQ-plots for the p-factor (b) and SBs factors (c), respectively. These panels show the results for the −log10-transformed two-tailed P values for the factor on the top half of the Miami plot and the log10-transformed one-tailed P values for QSNP on the bottom half. Factor hits that were within 100 kb of univariate hits are shown as black triangles, novel hits for the factors that were not within 100 kb of a univariate or QSNP hit are shown as red triangles and QSNP hits are shown as purple diamonds. d, The two-tailed −log10[P] in a Manhattan plot for the CC-GWAS comparison across MD and SCZ, which produced the most hits (orange diamonds), as well as the scatterplot of standardized case–control effect sizes of MD (x axis) versus SCZ (y axis), with CC-GWAS significant SNPs labelled in red. For b–d, the grey dashed lines indicate the significance threshold, which was defined using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.

We identified 33 unique hits with significant QSNP effects across the factors from the five-factor model. By comparison, we identified 117 QSNP hits from the p-factor model that showed significantly divergent effects across the five, lower-order psychiatric factors (Supplementary Table 36). These p-factor QSNP hits also included the chromosome 11 LAVA hotspot, where this region was found not to confer transdiagnostic risk due to an absence of signal for the Neurodevelopmental factor. For the SUD factor, highly significant QSNP hits were driven by variants in the genes involved in biological pathways specific to particular psychoactive substances, including the alcohol dehydrogenase genes (ADH1A, ADH1B and ADH1C) for AUD and the CHRNA3–CHRNA5–CHRNB4 nicotinic receptor subunit gene cluster for NIC. More QSNP loci for the p-factor model relative to the five-factor model indicates that many shared genetic relationships are better captured by the five factors (Supplementary Figs. 23 and 24).

A phenome-wide association study conducted in the Mayo Clinic Biobank revealed that factor hits were associated with multiple psychiatric disorders, especially those that loaded on the factor (Supplementary Table 38 and Supplementary Fig. 25). The Internalizing disorders (Supplementary Fig. 25d) and p-factor (Supplementary Fig. 25f) loci were also associated with a range of medical outcomes (for example, chronic pain and hypertension).

In more fine-grained analyses of disorder pairs, case–case GWAS (CC-GWAS)43 was used to identify loci with different allele frequencies across cases of different disorders. Such loci may reflect distinctive genetic effects across disorder pairs. CC-GWAS was applied to 75 disorder pairs, comparing 13 disorders. NIC was excluded because it is a continuous trait, and the pairs ANX–MD, ANX–PTSD and MD–PTSD were excluded because all had an rg estimate of >0.8, thereby risking an inflated type I error rate (Methods). The genome-wide significance threshold was defined at 5.5 × 10−10 (that is, 5 × 10−8/91 pairwise comparisons). An overview of CC-GWAS input parameters is provided in Supplementary Table 39.

In total, 412 loci showed significantly different effects across the 75 disorder pairs (Supplementary Tables 40 and 41); most (294 out of 412) were in comparisons that included SCZ, possibly reflecting either greater power for the SCZ GWAS or more distinctive biology for this disorder. Owing to overlap among the hits, the 412 loci comprised 109 LD-independent loci (Supplementary Table 42). Five of these were CC-GWAS specific, implying that they were not significantly associated with case–control status in either of the disorders in the respective disorder pair. CC-GWAS also computes a genome-wide genetic distance between the cases of two disorders (FST,causal), indicating how genetically dissimilar the cases are on average. As expected, these genetic distances were inversely correlated (r = −0.79, s.e. = 0.07) with rg (Supplementary Table 43). In support of the five-factor model, >99% of the CC-GWAS hits were identified for disorder pairs that loaded on separate factors (Supplementary Tables 44 and 45). Disorders that cluster on the same factor from the five-factor model are, apparently, largely indistinguishable at the level of individual genetic variants.

To understand biological functions influenced by the risk loci, we prioritized candidate risk genes implicated by the multivariate GWAS loci using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)44,45 and Hi-C44,46 datasets collected from fetal and adult brain samples (Methods and Supplementary Tables 46 and 47). Owing to the limited number of variants associated with other factors, analyses were restricted to the p-factor, the SB and Internalizing disorders factors and QSNP for these latter two factors. We first compared the target gene expression along the temporal trajectory of human brain development, finding that genes associated with the three factors were expressed at higher levels than QSNP target genes across the lifespan, with the largest difference observed at fetal stages and early life (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 26). This suggests that pleiotropic variants are involved in early, fundamental neurodevelopmental processes. We next examined biological processes using Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis47. The target genes of the p-factor were primarily enriched in broader biological processes related to gene regulation (Fig. 5). To enhance the specificity of the gene sets, we removed Internalizing disorders and SB target genes that also appeared for the p-factor. SB (minus p-factor) target genes were enriched in more specific terms related to neuron development. No significant results were identified for the Internalizing disorders factor, probably reflecting the large proportion of target genes overlapping with the p-factor. Results from MAGMA48 (Supplementary Methods) provided convergent support for the role of early neurodevelopmental processes in transdiagnostic psychiatric risk. Specifically, genetic signal for the five correlated factors and p-factor showed enrichment in genes identified from rare variant studies of ASD49,50,51, neurodevelopmental delay49 or both (Supplementary Fig. 27).

The P values from EWCE and MAGMA were two-sided and each had an FDR correction applied for multiple comparisons before averaging the two sets of results. EWCE P values were empirically derived using a permutation test; MAGMA P values were calculated using an F-test. Int, Internalizing disorders factor. The implied sample size for the three depicted psychiatric factors was: SB (\(\hat{n}\) = 127,202), Internalizing (\(\hat{n}\) = 1,637,337) and p-factor (\(\hat{n}\) = 2,168,621). CycProg, cycling progenitor; Endo/BBB, endothelial/blood brain barrier; ExNeu, excitatory neuron; InNeu, interneurons; IP, intermediate progenitor; OPC, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell; RG, radial glia; Astro, astrocyte; MSN, medium spiny neuron; ODC/Oligo, oligodendrocyte.

Averaged results across expression-weighted cell type enrichment (EWCE)52 and MAGMA were used to evaluate enrichment within neuronal cell types in fetal and adult single-cell datasets53,54,55,56,57 (Supplementary Tables 48 and 49). Genes associated with the SB factor were significantly enriched in fetal data in interneurons and seven excitatory neuron subtypes, the strongest of which was for excitatory maturing neurons53,54 (Fig. 5). The SB factor was also uniquely enriched for deep-layer excitatory neurons in the adult brain57. Internalizing disorder genes were enriched within four excitatory neuron subtypes in fetal data53, although the signal was not as strong or pervasive as for the SB factor. In adult data, the Internalizing factor was enriched for medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) interneurons56 and different glial cells, specifically oligodendrocytes and Bergmann glia56,57. The p-factor was enriched for five excitatory neuron subtypes in fetal data and oligodendrocyte precursor cells in adult data56. A significant proportion of these genes is expressed during both fetal and adult stages; cell type enrichment was largely driven by genes that are not expressed in a particular developmental stage (Supplementary Fig. 28). We also tested enrichment for loci specific to MD and SCZ identified from CC-GWAS. MD-specific signal was enriched for cycling and intermediate progenitors in fetal brain. SCZ-specific signal was enriched for endothelial, vascular and upper rhombic lip cells in adult brain (Supplementary Fig. 28).

We used stratified genomic SEM27, a multivariate corollary of partitioned LDSC58, to characterize the functional signals captured by the psychiatric factors in the five-factor and p-factor models, estimating enrichment for 162 functional annotations that passed quality control (Methods and Supplementary Table 50). Enrichment of the factor variances in the five-factor or p-factor models reflects groups of genetic variants that index a disproportionate concentration of genetic risk sharing. For the p-factor model, we also examined the enrichment of the residual (unique) variances of the five lower-order factors. Annotations significant for a factor in the p-factor model are therefore likely to capture signal specific to that factor. Enrichment was also calculated for a recent GWAS of height59 to evaluate the specificity of the psychiatric findings. We used a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of P < 2.81 × 10−5 (Methods). We focus here on results for the better-powered SB, Internalizing and p-factor, and do not discuss annotations that lacked psychiatric specificity, as indicated by significant enrichment for height (for example, evolutionarily conserved annotations).

We identified 34 annotations that were significant for the SB factor in both models and are thereby likely to be specific to the neurobiology of the SB factor. This included the intersection between protein-truncating-variant-intolerant (PI) genes and several neuronal subtypes, including excitatory CA1 and CA3 hippocampal neurons (Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 50). In total, 51 significant annotations were identified for the Internalizing disorders factor, including PI-oligodendrocyte precursor annotations. We also found strong enrichment for an annotation reflecting neural progenitor biology60, further implicating early neurobiological processes in shared psychiatric risk. No annotations remained significant for the Internalizing disorders factor's residual variance (that is, independent of the p-factor), as would be expected given that only 10% of the genetic variance in the Internalizing disorders factor was separate from p. Finally, 64 significant annotations were detected for the p-factor, the strongest of which were fetal male brain H3K4me1 histone mark and PI-GABAergic neuron annotations.

Our analyses characterized the landscape of shared and divergent genetic influences of common variants on 14 psychiatric disorders. At the genome-wide level, we confirmed pervasive genetic overlap across 14 clinically distinguished psychiatric disorders, as indicated by large pairwise rg within the EUR-like genetic ancestry group and even greater overlap when including loci that are shared, but have divergent directional effects. This overlap was parsimoniously captured by five genomic factors (Compulsive, SB, Neurodevelopmental, Internalizing and SUD), which explained the majority of the genetic variance of the individual disorders. We identified 101 regions with correlated effects, including a hotspot on chromosome 11 with associations for 8 disorders. We found that broadly pleiotropic variants are primarily involved in early neurobiological processes, while also identifying different brain cell types that uniquely confer risk to more circumscribed subsets of disorders. At the individual-variant level, we identified 238 loci associated with at least one of the five correlated psychiatric factors, along with 412 loci that distinguished disorders that primarily belong to different factors.

The SB (defined by SCZ and BIP) and Internalizing disorders (defined by major depression, PTSD and anxiety) factors offered a particularly useful way to understand shared risk across sets of disorders. For these factors, a diverse set of methods produced convergent results across genome-wide, regional and locus-level results, indicating that the disorders within these factors are characterized by overlapping genetic signal. A replicated finding across functional methods reflected enrichment for the SB factor in excitatory neuron annotations, including CA1 and CA3 hippocampal neurons, deep-layer neurons from adult data, and maturing, migrating, prefrontal and visual cortex excitatory neurons in fetal data. The Internalizing factor also showed enrichment in excitatory neurons, but was more consistently enriched in different glial cells in adult data, including oligodendrocytes and their precursor cells and Bergmann glia.

At the genome-wide level, the p-factor was strongly related to the Internalizing disorders factor and evinced the largest rgs with external traits reflecting broad clinical characteristics, such as neuroticism, stress sensitivity and loneliness. These results are consistent with conceptualizations of the p-factor as reflecting a general tendency towards negative emotionality61. In support of the p-factor, LAVA identified pleiotropic hotspots characterized by widespread local rg across disorders and multivariate GWAS yielded 160 hits for this factor alone. However, the p-factor also had more hits for the QSNP heterogeneity metric (117) than all five-factors from the correlated factors model (33), indicating that the p-factor alone is insufficient for explaining cross-disorder risk. The p-factor was largely enriched for broad biological categories, such as gene regulation. These results suggest a conceptual model in which there is a partial, broadly transdiagnostic component of genetic vulnerability to psychiatric disorders that primarily captures Internalizing genetic signals, with subsequent levels of more canalized and neurobiologically meaningful subdomains of psychopathology captured by the five factors.

Our study has several limitations. Analyses were restricted primarily to EUR-like genetic ancestry populations due to the limited availability of GWAS data for other groups and the limitations of methods requiring more genetically homogeneous groups62. The sample sizes for GWASs of non-EUR-like populations are still orders of magnitude smaller and not currently powered for more precise cross-ancestry assessments; this emphasizes the need for future research including the generation of additional ancestrally representative data, which will enable well-powered studies and the examination of cross-disorder genetic architecture across regional and cultural differences. Cross-ancestry rgs should be interpreted in light of findings that show considerably smaller within-disorder, within-ancestry rgs across cohorts for PTSD (rg = 0.73, s.e. = 0.21)63 and MD (rg = 0.76, s.e. = 0.03)64 relative to SCZ (rg = 0.95, s.e. = 0.03)65. This suggests that cross-ancestry rgs for PTSD and MD could drop below 1 for reasons independent of ancestry-specific signal, such as environmental moderation of genetic effects or increased phenotypic heterogeneity. Another limitation reflects potential inflation in rg estimates by cross-trait assortative mating66, diagnostic misclassification67 or the use of super-normal controls68. However, the high genetic overlap observed among subclusters of psychiatric disorders is unlikely to be explained by cross-trait assortment alone69 and current sensitivity analyses using stricter case definitions suggested that impact of diagnostic misclassification was modest. Wide ranges in sample sizes across the univariate psychiatric GWAS used as input should also be considered when evaluating relative levels of significant findings, particularly for locus discovery.

The current investigation into the genetic structure of psychopathology reflects a comprehensive genomic examination of cross-disorder psychiatric risk. It extends previous cross-disorder psychiatric genetics analyses5,27 using updated datasets, new disorders and triangulation across different methodological approaches to produce a robust set of findings70. We identified subsets of disorders with particularly high genetic overlap and characterized the biological processes implicated by their shared risk. This evidence should contribute substantially to the ongoing debates regarding diagnostic boundaries between disorders such as BIP and SCZ. Certain pharmacological interventions have proven to be effective across a range of disorders (for example, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors)71, indicating that future work could build on our findings to identify new or repurposed therapeutics that target the shared signal captured by the factors. While much remains to be done, cross-disorder genetics continues to fill in critical gaps in our understanding of shared and unique psychiatric risk factors with implications for the future of psychiatric research, therapeutics and nosology.

A standard set of quality-control filters was applied to all univariate GWAS summary statistics before conducting cross-disorder analyses. Any additional quality-control filters applied by a method are noted in its corresponding section below. These quality-control filters included removing strand ambiguous SNPs, restricting to SNPs with an imputation score (INFO) > 0.6 and with a minor allele frequency > 1% when this information was available in the GWAS data. We also restricted analyses to SNPs with an SNP-specific sum of the effective sample that is >50% of the total sum of the effective sample or, when this SNP-specific information was not available, to SNPs for which >50% of the cohorts contributed information, as indexed by the direction column in the GWAS summary statistics. The MHC region was excluded from all summary statistics before the analysis. Base pair location is given in genome build GRCh37/hg19 throughout the Article and its Supplementary Information.

All GWAS summary statistics were run through the munge function before running the multivariable version of LDSC used as input to genomic SEM7. The munge function aligns GWAS effects to the same reference allele and restricts to HapMap3 SNPs and SNPs with INFO > 0.9. LDSC was estimated using these munged summary statistics, applying a liability threshold model for all case–control psychiatric disorders (that is, all disorders except for the NIC outcome, which reflects a GWAS of the continuous Fagerström test for nicotine dependence24). For comparability, population prevalence was chosen to match what was used in the corresponding manuscript that introduced the GWAS of each trait. The ascertainment correction was performed using the sum of effective sample sizes across contributing cohorts for each disorder72. We note that, for CUD26, we used the recently described formula72 for estimating the sum of effective sample size directly from the GWAS data. This is because, in this instance, we found that the implied sum of effective sample size was much smaller than the value computed from the reported sample sizes, which is probably attributable to the complex familial structure in the included deCODE sample.

The two primary estimates from multivariable LDSC are the genetic covariance matrix and the corresponding sampling covariance matrix. The genetic covariance matrix contains SNP-based heritabilities on the diagonal and the co-heritabilities (genetic covariances) across every pairwise combination of included disorders on the off-diagonal. The sampling covariance matrix contains squared standard errors (sampling variances) on the diagonal, which allows genomic SEM to appropriately account for differences in the precision of GWAS estimates for disorders with unequal power. The off-diagonal contains sampling dependencies, which will arise in the presence of sample overlap across GWAS phenotypes. As these sampling dependencies are estimated directly from the data, summary statistics can be included with varying and unknown levels of sample overlap. We note that study overlap between disorders is not expected to affect the findings, as study overlap affects only the covariance of error terms of the GWASs resulting in increased intercepts of cross-trait LDSC with no expected impact on the estimates of rg4,43. To guard against model overfitting, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed on even chromosomes and used to inform the fitting of an confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in odd chromosomes. The EFA was performed using the factanal R package for 2–5 factors using both promax (correlated) and varimax (orthogonal) rotations. Disorders were specified to load on a factor in the CFA when the standardized EFA loadings were >0.3, with disorders allowed to cross-load (for example, TS on the Compulsive and Neurodevelopmental factors) if this was the case for multiple factors. Models specified based on varimax EFA results still allowed for interfactor correlations, as allowing only subsets of disorders to load on each factor will induce genetic overlap. A common-factor model was also modelled to test a single-latent-factor model predicting all 14 disorders. We did not evaluate models with more than five factors as these caused issues with model convergence. Results revealed that a five-factor model specified based on the promax EFA results (Supplementary Table 3) fit the data best in odd chromosomes (CFI = 0.973, SRMR = 0.073; Supplementary Table 2). This model also fit the data well in all autosomes, and was subsequently carried forward for all analyses, along with the p-factor model described in the main text. Considering the high rg across PTSD and MD, we also evaluated a model (in odd autosomes) that estimated the residual genetic covariance across these two disorders; however, we found that this did not significantly improve model fit (model χ21 difference = 2.86, P = 0.094).

Stratified genomic SEM proceeds in two stages27. In stage 1, the s_ldsc function in genomic SEM, a multivariable implementation of stratified LDSC (S-LDSC)58, was used to estimate the stratified genetic covariance and sampling covariance matrices within each functional annotation. We specifically used the zero-order estimates for these analyses. In stage 2, the enrich function was used to estimate the enrichment of the factor variances and residual genetic variances unique to the indicators. This is achieved by first estimating the model in the genome-wide annotation including all SNPs. The factor loadings from these genome-wide estimates are then fixed and the (residual) variances of the factors and disorders are freely estimated within each annotation. These reflect the within-annotation estimates for each variance component that are scaled to be comparable to the genome-wide estimates. This cumulative set of results is used to calculate the enrichment ratio of ratios. The numerator reflects the ratio of the estimate of the factor variance within an annotation over the genome-wide estimate. The denominator is the ratio of SNPs in the annotation over the total number of SNPs examined. Enrichment estimates greater than the null of 1 are therefore observed when an annotation explains a disproportionate level of genetic variance relative to the annotation's size.

Functional annotations used to estimate the stratified matrices were obtained from a variety of data resources. This included: (1) the baseline annotations from the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 BaslineLD (v.2.2)73 from the S-LDSC developers58; (2) tissue-specific gene expression annotation files created using data from GTEx74 and DEPICT75; (3) tissue-specific histone marks from the Roadmap Epigenetics project76; (4) annotations that we created27 from data in GTEx74 and the Genome Aggregate Database (gnomAD)77 that index protein-truncating-variant-intolerant (PI) genes, genes expressed in different types of brain cells in the human hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and their intersection; (5) 11 neuronal cell type annotations defined by peaks from single-cell assay for transposase accessibility by sequencing (scATAC–seq) in the human forebrain54; (6) an annotation defined by peaks from ATAC–seq data with greater accessibility in neural progenitor enriched regions encompassing the ventricular, subventricular and intermediate zones (GZ) over neuron-enriched regions within the subplate, marginal zone and cortical plate (CP; GZ > CP), and a second CP > GZ annotation reflecting the converse60; and (7) a fetal and an adult annotations defined by eQTLs identified using high-throughput RNA-seq45. We excluded 22 annotations that produced stratified genetic covariance matrices that were highly non-positive definite to examine a total of 162 annotations. We corrected for multiple testing by using a strict Bonferroni correction for the 162 annotations analysed that passed quality control across the 11 factors examined (the factors from the five-factor factor model and the p-factor and residuals of the five factors from the p-factor model) of P < 2.81 × 10−5.

The sumstats function in genomic SEM was used to align SNP effects across traits to the same reference allele and standardize the effects and their corresponding s.e. values relative to the total variance in the predicted phenotype. The s.e. values were additionally corrected for uncontrolled confounds by taking the product of s.e. values and the LDSC univariate intercept when this value was >1. After removing 136 SNPs that produced highly non-positive definite matrices when combined with the genetic covariance matrix, the final listwise deleted set consisted of 2,795,800 SNPs present across all 14 disorders. The userGWAS function was used to estimate the multivariate GWAS for SNP effects on the five factors from the five-factor model and the p-factor. We used a significance threshold of P < 8.33 × 10−9, reflecting the standard genome-wide threshold of 5 × 10−8 with a Bonferroni correction for the six factors. As a quality-control check, we confirmed that the attenuation ratio32 was near 0 for all factors (Supplementary Table 17), suggesting that the factor signal is not due to uncontrolled confounds (such as population stratification).

The QSNP heterogeneity metric is a χ2-distributed test statistic produced through a nested-model comparison of a common pathway model, in which the SNP predicts a latent factor, to an independent pathways model, where the SNP directly predicts the factor indicators. Factor-specific QSNP estimates for the five-factor model were estimated using five independent pathways models that consisted of the SNP predicting both the indicators for one factor and the remaining four factors. For the p-factor model, the SNP predicted the five, first-order factors to obtain QSNP estimates for the second-order, p-factor.

We applied the cross-ancestry Popcorn33 method to estimate genetic impact correlation (ρgi metric) across EUR-like, EAS-like and AFR-like genetic ancestry groups. Six disorders were included in the analysis, including EAS-like summary statistics for MD and SCZ and AFR-like summary statistics for OUD, AUD, PTSD and CUD. The reference panel for the EAS dataset was based on 504 individuals from EAS population of the 1000 Genomes Phase3 data78. For AFR-like genetic ancestry, we performed the Popcorn analysis using three alternative references from 1000 Genomes Phase3 data: (1) the African Ancestry in the southwest United States subgroup (n = 61); (2) the African population (n = 661); and (3) a reference panel created to capture the admixed ancestral background of some AFR-like individuals reflecting the combination across the EUR-like and AFR-like sample (n = 1,164). Cross-ancestry results and within-ancestry LDSC results for the AFR-like and EAS-like populations are reported in Supplementary Table 4. We acknowledge that using LDSC with admixed ancestry may violate its assumptions; thus, our results for AFR-like ancestry should be interpreted with caution. With this in mind, we performed LDSC for AFR-like datasets using two different LD reference panels for AFR-like ancestry or admixed American ancestry from Pan UK Biobank to assess their impact on results (Supplementary Table 4). The results in Extended Data Table 1 report liability-scale heritabilities for AFR-like datasets using the admixed LD scores, as these produced more sensible results.

MiXeR (v.1.3) was applied using the procedure outlined in the original publication6. We performed additional simulations to evaluate appropriate threshold for inclusion of a GWAS study in cross-trait MiXeR analysis. In previous simulations, we demonstrated that MiXeR cannot produce reliable estimates for analyses using low-powered input79. Specifically, as statistical power increases, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) differences indicate that MiXeR-modelled estimates become increasingly more distinguishable from the minimum and maximum overlap, corresponding to the increasing precision of MiXeR estimates. This demonstrates that AIC differences are sensitive to the input power of the summary statistics and can be used to support the reliability of MiXeR estimates. On the basis of these previous simulations, psychiatric disorders were brought forward for cross-trait MiXeR analysis when the product of NEff and MiXeR \({h}_{\mathrm{SNP}}^{2}\) estimates were >12,000, where this cut point reflects the product of NEff ≥ 100,000 and \({h}_{{\rm{SNP}}}^{2}\ge 0.12\). As a result, we excluded OUD, TS, NIC, OCD, ASD and CUD. As AN was very close to this threshold and had a high AIC in univariate analysis, it was brought forward for cross-trait analyses along with the seven remaining psychiatric disorders. For the NIC summary statistics, we excluded two loci defined as a 2 Mb window around either the CHRNA3–CHRNA5–CHRNB4 gene cluster or the CHRNA4 gene, which is known to have such a large effect on the phenotype that it would skew results. We note that, for PTSD, ANX and MD, the rgs were so high that there was little room for additional overlap beyond correlation, given MiXeR's modelling assumptions. Specifically, the range in size of the putative shared component is too small to allow for an accurate model fit in this situation, as demonstrated by the range on the respective x axes (Supplementary Fig. 7). There is also a considerable uncertainty of polygenicity estimates for PTSD and ANX. Thus, cross-trait MiXeR results for PTSD, ANX and MD should be interpreted with caution.

Local rg analyses were conducted using LAVA v.0.1.035. To avoid evaluating local rgs in regions in which there is a low amount of genetic signal (which could lead to unstable or uninterpretable estimates) for all phenotype pairs and loci separately, we used the univariate test in LAVA as a filtering step, computing bivariate local rgs only in loci where both analysed phenotypes have a \({h}_{\mathrm{SNP}}^{2}\) significant at P < 4.6 × 10−5 = 0.05/1,093 (where 1,093 represents the total number of analysed loci). Given this filtering step, we performed 24,273 local rg tests across all loci and phenotype pairs, resulting in a Bonferroni corrected P value threshold of P < 2.1 × 10−6 = 0.05/24,273 for the bivariate, local rg analyses.

Genomic loci used for the regional rg analyses were defined by segmenting the genome into approximately equal-sized, semi-independent blocks using the LAVA partitioning algorithm (https://github.com/cadeleeuw/lava-partitioning). This algorithm works by iteratively splitting the chromosomes into smaller chunks, creating break points at regions where the LD between SNPs is the lowest (see the program manual for more details). To achieve a balance between block size and correlations between adjacent blocks, we ran the algorithm with the default parameters, changing only the minimum size requirement (in the number of SNPs) to 5,000, based on the 1,000 genomes data. Sample overlap was accounted for by obtaining the estimated intercepts from bivariate LDSC and providing these to LAVA.

CC-GWAS43 was applied to identify loci with different allele frequencies across cases of different disorders, contrasting cases one disorder pair at a time. CC-GWAS is based on estimating a weighted difference of the CC-GWAS results of the disorders considered, thereby avoiding the necessity to match cases across disorders at individual level. CC-GWAS combines two components. The first component (CC-GWASOLS) optimizes power and protects against type I error rate at null–null SNPs (SNPs that affect neither of both disorders), based on analytical expectations of genetic differences between cases and controls of both diseases. The second component (CC-GWASExact) controls type I error rate at ‘stress test' SNPs (SNPs affecting both disorders resulting in no allele frequency difference across cases of both disorders). A SNP is significantly associated with case–case status when the P value of the OLS component reaches genome-wide significance and when the P value of the exact-component is <10−4 (there is an upper bound on the number of stress test SNPs as these are causal SNPs). Importantly, CC-GWAS also filters false-positive associations that may arise due to (subtle) differential tagging of a stress test SNP in the respective CC-GWAS, which are present even in within-ancestry analysis43. CC-GWAS excludes analyses of any disorder pair with an rg > 0.8 because these have a small genetic distance between cases with increased risk of type-I error at stress test SNPs.

The same locus definition (also referred to as a hit in the main text) was used for CC-GWAS and genomic SEM. Significant loci were identified using the clumping functionality in PLINK v.1.9 with an r2 threshold of 0.1 and a 3,000 kb window. Physically proximal loci (including when comparing loci both within and across factors from genomic SEM and for CC-GWAS and univariate GWAS results), were additionally collapsed into a single locus when the locus windows were within 100 kb of one another on either side. For the univariate results, we use the same locus definition applied to the complete GWAS summary statistics for each disorder (that is, without our quality-control filters applied), along with a more liberal genome-wide significance threshold of P < 5 × 10−8 without a Bonferroni correction. These more liberal quality-control and significance thresholds were used for univariate loci to benchmark whether genomic SEM and CC-GWAS loci could be considered strictly novel. The 1000 Genomes Phase 3 reference files78 were used for LD pruning for each respective genetic ancestry group (that is, EUR-like, EAS-like, AFR-like).

To predict the target genes of the variants (Supplementary Fig. 17), we first expanded the variants by including any variants within the LD block (r2 > 0.6) based on the EUR population using LDProxy from the LDlink R package80. We began by curating the genes of which the promoters (±500 bp from the transcription start site) or exons overlap with the variants of interest. Conversely, to map target genes that are not near the variants, we first filtered the variants for those localized in either human fetal brain open-chromatin regions60 or human adult brain H3K27ac ChIP–seq regions44, both of which indicate enhancer activity, but during different stages of brain development. Next, we assigned target genes to each filtered variant using eQTL44,45 or HiC loops44,46 generated from samples from the corresponding stages. We also assigned variants present in promoter or exonic regions to the corresponding genes (Supplementary Fig. 17). Finally, we filtered all of the target genes for those expressed (RNA-seq count > 0) in the corresponding tissues. In this way, we obtained 715 and 572 target genes in fetal and adult brains, respectively (Supplementary Tables 40 and 41). Notably, there is a prominent overlap between the two sets of genes, which is a result of the shared, positional mapping of genes to promoters or exons (Supplementary Fig. 17). Both the fetal and adult target genes were enriched in GO terms related to neuron or brain development, suggesting the biological relevance of the genetic variants.

To plot the temporal expression trends of the predicted target genes, we used gene expression datasets from the BrainSpan. We plotted the averaged gene expression (reads per million kb) of the selected genes over all samples collected from the cortex at the available stages of development, then generated a smoothened curve with the loess method. We performed GO enrichment analysis using the ToppGene suite36. We filtered the enriched terms by containing at least 10% of the input list of genes, then displayed up to top 5 terms by adjusted P values under the indicated category.

EWCE52 was used to assess the cell type enrichment of target genes for the variants using a size-biased averaging method. This method uses single-cell datasets to compute the average expression of a set of genes (in this case, genes assigned to variants for each factor) and compares this to the average expression levels for 100,000 permuted gene lists of the same size that are randomly sampled from a background set of genes. Annotations were taken from publicly available datasets53,54,55,56,57, but simplified to provide cell-type-level instead of cluster-level enrichments. For example, several upper-layer clusters in the dataset of ref. 57 were combined into ‘ExcNeu superficial' and so on. For the ref. 56 dataset, EWCE objects were processed for each brain region separately. This included the hippocampal formation, cortex, cerebral nuclei (dissections including basal nuclei, amygdaloid complex, basal forebrain, claustrum), midbrain (including tissues from thalamic complex, hypothalamus, and midbrain) and hindbrain (including tissues from spinal cord, pons, myelencephalon and cerebellum) and non-neuronal cells across regions. For superclusters that were present in multiple regions, enrichment was tested only for regions with the highest abundance of that supercluster (for example, MGE interneuron supercluster is most abundant in cortex, so this cell type was dropped from enrichment analyses in the midbrain) to prevent excess multiple comparisons. P values were FDR-corrected based on the number of cell types × gene lists within brain region and dataset.

MAGMA gene-set enrichment analyses were performed using the MAGMA.Celltyping package in R81. Rather than considering only the top associated genes, as done in EWCE, MAGMA relies on the genome-wide signals to competitively evaluate enrichment through linear regression48. We used the European subset of the 1000 Genomes78 as LD reference data, and mapped SNPs to genes based on their genomic location (GRCh37/hg19). To allow the inclusion of nearby regulatory variants, we considered all SNPs within a 35 kb upstream and 10 kb downstream window of the gene transcription region. As signed effect-size estimates are not available for the QSNP results, these analyses were restricted to the factors. The FDR corrected P values from MAGMA and EWCE were averaged together to produce the results reported in the main text (but see Supplementary Tables 48 and 49 for P values from the individual methods).

Power curves estimating the sample size of a GWAS study are needed to saturate the yield of genome-wide significant loci. The legend shows the current effective sample size of today's GWAS, followed by the projected effective sample size needed for the GWAS yield to saturate.

Bar graphs depict genetic correlations with the 31 complex traits for the five psychiatric factors from the correlated factors model and the second-order, p-factor from the hierarchical model. Panels are separated by the different groupings of traits (e.g., cognitive; socioeconomic). Bars depicted with a dashed outline were significant at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold for the QTrait heterogeneity metric that flags traits whose patterns of genetic correlations from LDSC do not conform to those implied by the factor model. Error bars are +/− 1.96 SE that are centred around the point estimate of the genetic correlations. Bar depicted with a * reflect values that were significant at a Bonferroni corrected threshold for multiple comparisons, that were also not significant at this same Bonferroni corrected threshold for QTrait. This is with exception of the p-factor, which is depicted with a ‘*' even if it is significant for the QTrait, as long as that same trait was significantly correlated with the majority (at least three) of the five other factors. The two-sided P-values used to evaluate significance were derived from the Z-statistics, calculated as the point estimate of the genetic correlation divided by its standard error. Correlations are ordered according to the point estimate for the p-factor. The implied sample size for the psychiatric factors was: Compulsive (\(\hat{n}\) = 54,100); Schizophrenia/Bipolar (\(\hat{n}\) = 127,202); Neurodevelopmental (\(\hat{n}\)  = 84,760); Internalizing (\(\hat{n}\) = 1,637,337); Substance Use (\(\hat{n}\) = 313,395); p-factor (\(\hat{n}\) = 2,168,621). See Suppl. Table 12 for sample sizes for the external traits and Suppl. Table 13 for exact P-values.

See Suppl. Table 12 for sample sizes for the external traits and Suppl. Table 13 for exact P-values.

Bar graph depicts the enrichment results for different brain cell types, protein-truncating variant intolerant (PI) genes, and the intersection across PI genes and brain cell types. Results are shown only for the SB, Internalizing, and p-factor due to the limited signal for the other factors. Enrichment for height is depicted in purple to benchmark results and evaluate specificity in signal for the psychiatric factors relative to another human complex trait. Error bars are +/- 1.96 SE that are centred around the enrichment point estimate. Enrichment estimates that were significant at a strict Bonferroni corrected threshold for multiple comparisons are shown with a *. The one-sided P-values used to evaluate significance were derived from the Z-statistics, calculated as the enrichment point estimate divided by its standard error. Exact P-values are reported in Suppl. Table 50. The implied sample size for the psychiatric factors was: Compulsive (\(\hat{n}\) = 54,100); Schizophrenia/Bipolar (\(\hat{n}\) = 127,202); Neurodevelopmental (\(\hat{n}\)  = 84,760); Internalizing (\(\hat{n}\) = 1,637,337); Substance Use (\(\hat{n}\) = 313,395); p-factor (\(\hat{n}\) = 2,168,621).

The incidence of cardiometabolic diseases is increasing globally, and both poor diet and the human gut microbiome have been implicated1. However, the field lacks large-scale, comprehensive studies exploring these links in diverse populations2. Here, in over 34,000 US and UK participants with metagenomic, diet, anthropometric and host health data, we identified known and yet-to-be-cultured gut microbiome species associated significantly with different diets and risk factors. We developed a ranking of species most favourably and unfavourably associated with human health markers, called the ‘ZOE Microbiome Health Ranking 2025'. This system showed strong and reproducible associations between the ranking of microbial species and both body mass index and host disease conditions on more than 7,800 additional public samples. In an additional 746 people from two dietary interventional clinical trials, favourably ranked species increased in abundance and prevalence, and unfavourably ranked species reduced over time. In conclusion, these analyses provide strong support for the association of both diet and microbiome with health markers, and the summary system can be used to inform the basis for future causal and mechanistic studies. It should be emphasized, however, that causal inference is not possible without prospective cohort studies and interventional clinical trials.

Cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in Western countries and constitute a heavy burden on global healthcare systems1. The most predominant CMDs are cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D)3, which are connected with the increased consumption of calorie-dense, high-risk processed foods observed over the past few decades4. Habitual diet is not only among the known risk factors associated with CMDs, but also the primary modifiable target for prevention and treatment5. Well established anthropometric and intermediary measures of CMDs, ranging from clinical measurements (for example, blood pressure) to lipid profiles (such as triglycerides, cholesterol and lipoproteins), glucose levels (for example, fasting and postprandial glucose, and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)), inflammatory markers (for example, glycosylated proteins, the systemic inflammation marker GlycA21 and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein), and known risk factors such as body mass index (BMI), can be used to study the diet–CMD axis6,7,8 but do not consider the biochemical mechanisms occurring in the human gut.

The human gut microbiome has emerged as a cofactor on the same axis as it is associated with diet and cardiometabolic conditions9,10,11,12 and is a modifiable element13,14,15. A change in dietary patterns can shift the species-level composition of the microbiome, with knock-on effects on host health16. However, individual responses to dietary interventions vary, and precision nutrition aims at identifying host-specific factors that modulate the interaction between diet and host health17, but it is currently not possible to disentangle the effects diet plays to improve cardiometabolic health via the microbiome. Furthermore, the composition of the gut microbiome displays high individuality and variation depending on different demographics, ethnicity, sex and age; hence, defining or identifying universal biomarkers of a healthy gut microbiome has proven difficult18,19,20.

Nutritional intervention studies usually involve low sample-size cohorts at the population level and are often limited by their statistical power and specificity to local lifestyle and dietary habits, which are all critical aspects, especially given the microbiome's complexity and variability. Large-scale comprehensive studies with multi-national populations can help disentangle some of the complex interplays between dietary patterns and the gut microbiome to develop personalized interventions to prevent and treat CMDs. Accordingly, we collated, sampled and analysed five of the largest metagenomic cohorts available to date, comprising more than 34,000 people and spanning two continents, paired with dietary data, detailed anthropometric and health markers. We identified microbiome species consistently associated with more favourable and (inversely) unfavourable health markers across continents. These species were organized into two microbiome rankings, representing host health and diet quality, respectively, that can be the basis for future causal and mechanistic studies.

We used four large-scale microbiome cohorts from the ZOE PREDICT studies (n = 33,596; Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1 and Methods) to assemble an extensive microbiome dataset of people with detailed dietary records along with anthropometric measures. Together with the previously available ZOE PREDICT 1 cohort9 (n = 1,098), the PREDICT cohorts comprise 34,694 participants from both the USA (n = 21,340) and the UK (n = 13,354; Methods). Collected data comprise common health risk factors such as BMI, triglycerides, blood glucose and HbA1c, as well as several dietary indices and clinical markers that are intermediary measures of cardiometabolic health, such as the atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk, high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and GlycA21 (Supplementary Table 2 and Methods).

a, In this study, we considered and harmonized five cross-sectional ZOE PREDICT cohorts with participants from the UK and the USA (Supplementary Fig. 1). For each cohort, sample size and the percentage of female participants (% F) are reported in the upper bar plots, with sequencing depth (left-hand columns, darker colour, average size in gigabases) and the total number of detected species (right-hand columns, lighter colour) are reported in the middle bar plots, showing that cohorts with lower sequencing depths do not have fewer total numbers of detected species. Bottom box plots, distributions of age (left-hand columns, darker colour) and BMI (right-hand columns, lighter colour) in the five PREDICT cohorts (the PREDICT 1 (P1) cohort is split into its UK and US parts, but considered as a single cohort). Box plots show first and third quartiles (boxes) and the median (middle line); whiskers extend up to 1.5 × interquartile range (IQR). b, Random forest classification (discriminating the first three quartiles against the fourth quartile) and regression machine learning models (Methods) trained on the whole microbiome SGB-level relative abundance values with a cross-validation approach, show moderately strong and consistent associations with different categories of clinical data available across the five cross-sectional ZOE PREDICT cohorts (full machine learning results are reported in Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). HEI, healthy eating index; PDI, plant-based diet index; hPDI, healthful PDI; oPDI, overall PDI.

A systematic machine learning validated approach9,22 (Methods) revealed strong associations consistent across the five ZOE PREDICT cohorts between the microbiome and surrogate health markers and nutrition (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table 2 and Methods). Markers that were classified accurately by the gut microbiome included glycemia, blood cholesterol, triglycerides and inflammation (both fasting and postprandial; Extended Data Fig. 1), with age, BMI, the healthy eating index23 and the healthful plant-based diet index (PDI)24 also correlated with microbiome machine learning regression estimates (Spearman's correlation > 0.4; Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 2). The top predicted markers from both machine learning regression and classification showed consistent associations across PREDICT cohorts, with average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) ranging from 0.64 to 0.73, and an average Spearman's correlation ranging from 0.30 to 0.46 for regression (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 3).

We next set out to identify which gut microbial species were most responsible for the microbiome's associations with host markers. To do so, we grouped the 37 markers into three categories: (1) anthropometric-derived and accessible health-related measures (hereafter called ‘personal' and including, for example, ASCVD and blood pressure), (2) fasting (for example, GlycA, triglycerides, HDL, cholesterol and glucose) and (3) postprandial markers, which are surrogate measures of cardiometabolic health. As expected, some markers tended to correlate quantitatively (Supplementary Table 4 and Methods).

We considered 661 non-rare microbial species (greater than 20% prevalence; Methods) according to the definition of species-level genome bins (SGBs)19,20, and computed the partial Spearman's correlations (corrected for sex, age and BMI) between the relative abundance of each micro-organism and the value of each marker. Correlations were ranked, and correlations' ranks were averaged within each category and then averaged among the three categories in each cohort (Methods). The five resulting cohort-level average rankings were averaged to derive a single ranking that we called the ‘ZOE Microbiome Health Ranking 2025' (ZOE MB health-rank). This resulted in a ranking for 661 microbial species in which the lowest ranking (closer to 0) species are the most positively associated with the considered panel of host markers and vice versa for the highest ranking (closer to 1) species (Fig. 2, Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6).

a, Average percentiles for the 15 most favourably (top) and unfavourably (bottom) ranked SGBs (selected for visualization purposes) across all five PREDICT cohorts. Percentiles are computed from the ranking of the correlations between SGBs and the different markers in each clinical data category. Percentiles close to 0 reflect SGBs consistently correlated positively with positive markers and negatively with negative markers, and vice versa for percentiles close to 1. For each cohort, the average percentiles for three clinical data categories are shown (personal, fasting and postprandial) and the cohort-level average. The rightmost column of the heatmap reports the ZOE MB health-ranks with the distribution of their relative abundance values when present (derived from n = 34,694 participants spanning the five PREDICT cohorts). Box plots as in Fig. 1. b,c, Detailed percentiles for the 15 most favourably and unfavourably ranked SGBs against the markers of the three clinical data categories of the PREDICT 1 (UK) (b) and PREDICT 3 US22A (US) (c) cohorts.

Most SGBs ranked within the 50 most favourably or unfavourably linked to host anthropometry belong to the Firmicutes phylum (92 out of 100) and, in particular, to the Clostridia class (n = 80; Supplementary Table 7). Within this class, in the ZOE MB health-ranks, most SGBs belonged to the Clostridiales order, with 32 unfavourably ranked SGBs (of which n = 27 Lachnospiraceae out of 50) and 31 favourably ranked SGBs (n = 13 Lachnospiraceae and n = 12 Ruminococcaceae) assigned to this order. Collectively, the average total relative abundance of the 50 most favourably ranked SGBs is 5.98%, whereas the 50 most unfavourably ranked SGBs account for 13.64% (Supplementary Table 7).

A large portion of the 50 most favourably ZOE MB health-ranked SGBs are unknown (n = 22), meaning that these are uncultured species represented solely by microbial genomes reconstructed from metagenomic data. Of the 28 known SGBs (with available isolate genomes), 24 are still uncharacterized species without phenotypic descriptions and recognized taxonomic names (Supplementary Table 7). Eubacterium siraeum (SGB4198) and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (SGB15317) are among the few exceptions with previous support for their favourable role9,25.

By contrast, the 50 unfavourably ZOE MB health-ranked SGBs are generally species with cultured isolates and established taxonomic labels (Supplementary Table 7). Among the 44 known SGBs, several species were already linked with detrimental effects on the host, including Ruminococcus gnavus26, Flavonifractor plautii27, Ruminococcus torques28,29 and Enterocloster bolteae30. Overall, the most prevalent favourably ranked health-associated micro-organisms in the human gut belong to under-investigated species, highlighting gaps in our knowledge of the potential beneficial role of the human microbiome in promoting and maintaining non-pathogenic conditions.

Similarly to the ZOE MB health-ranks, we defined a species ranking on the basis only of dietary markers across all five PREDICT cohorts, which we called the ‘ZOE Microbiome Diet Ranking 2025' (ZOE MB diet-rank; Supplementary Table 5). As markers of a generally healthier diet, we adopted five validated indices (Methods) computed starting from validated food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) or logged diet data (logged using a mobile phone app), reflecting long- and short-term dietary habits, respectively (Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5 and Methods).

The ZOE MB health- and diet-rankings showed, as expected, general concordance (Spearman's ρ = 0.72; Extended Data Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 5). Although the large majority of the SGBs highlighted by high or low ZOE MB health-ranks and diet-ranks belong to unknown taxa, reported phenotypic characteristics of known species agree with our analysis. For example, R. torques (SGB4608) and F. plautii (SGB15132), discussed previously as unfavourable species according to the ZOE MB health-ranks, were also concordantly unfavourably ranked in the ZOE MB diet-ranks (0.991–0.904 and 0.981–0.901, respectively). On the other hand, the favourably ranked Blautia glucerasea (SGB4816) was described to reduce visceral fat accumulation, blood glucose and triglycerides in mice31 (ZOE MB health-ranks and diet-ranks of 0.267 and 0.062, respectively). As another example, in a dietary fibre supplementation trial involving individuals with T2D, Lachnospira eligens (SGB5082) was increased selectively and associated negatively with postprandial glucose and insulin, body weight and waist circumference32 (ZOE MB health-ranks and diet-ranks of 0.276 and 0.115, respectively), indicating that precise dietary interventions aimed at stimulating beneficial bacterial growth can contribute to treating or managing metabolic disorders symptoms.

Despite the overall agreement between the ZOE MB health- and diet-rankings, 65 out of the 661 ranked SGBs showed discordant rankings (absolute rank difference at least 0.3; Extended Data Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 8). Generally, the different trends may be due to the different capacities of certain bacteria (for example, generalists) to use a variety of substrates, including those derived from unhealthy diets, while releasing functional metabolites with protective or health-promoting effects. Among these, for example, Harryflintia acetispora (SGB14838) was found associated with favourable cardiometabolic markers and unfavourable diets (ZOE MB health-rank = 0.363 and ZOE MB diet-rank = 0.879) in this study. This strict anaerobe can use readily available monosaccharides such as maltose, glucose and fructose, but can also produce short-chain fatty acids33, which are regulatory and anti-inflammatory mediators34.

Across the US and UK populations, the ZOE MB health-rankings showed high consistency (Spearman's ρ = 0.61; Extended Data Fig. 6b), whereas country-specific ZOE MB diet-rankings were more heterogeneous (Spearman's ρ = 0.26; Extended Data Fig. 6c). The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC)35 also suggest that the ZOE MB health-ranks are more consistent across countries than the ZOE MB diet-ranks (ICC = 0.5929 and 0.2623, respectively; Extended Data Fig. 6b,c). Across cohorts, we obtained an ICC = 0.63 and 0.46 for the ZOE MB health-ranks and diet-ranks, respectively, indicating that health rankings were more able to capture cohorts and countries differences, whereas the most favourably ranked species appeared to match across populations with similar levels of industrialization and lifestyle.

BMI is an imperfect but widely adopted and easy-to-obtain anthropometric marker of health risk. As BMI was not included among the markers of the ZOE MB health- and diet-rankings, and we corrected for it in the partial correlation analysis, we set out to evaluate how the two rankings can stratify people according to their BMI to assess how health signatures in the gut microbiome are reflected in body mass.

We correlated the 661 ZOE MB health-ranked species with BMI (corrected for sex and age), in each PREDICT cohort, and found that, overall, the ranks were associated positively with BMI (Spearman's ρ = 0.72), with the favourably ranked SGBs correlated negatively with BMI, whereas unfavourably ranked SGBs correlated positively with BMI (Fig. 3a). These results were confirmed when considering the ZOE MB diet-ranks and discrete BMI categories (Extended Data Fig. 7a–c; all intra-dataset comparisons statistically significant at Q < 0.2 and all 30 except 7 at Q < 0.01) as well as the cumulative abundance of the species in the two 50-species sets (Fig. 3b,c; all intra-dataset comparisons statistically significant at Q < 0.2 and all 30 except 5 at Q < 0.01).

a, Concordance of ZOE MB health-ranks with partial Spearman's correlations against BMI (corrected for sex and age) across PREDICT cohorts. Favourably ranked SGBs correlate negatively with BMI; unfavourably ranked SGBs correlate positively (ZOE MB diet-ranks in Extended Data Fig. 7a). Shading represents 95% confidence interval. b,c, Cumulative relative abundance of favourably (b) and unfavourably (c) ranked SGBs across BMI categories. As BMI increases, reflecting higher health risks, the abundance of favourable SGBs decreases whereas that of unfavourable SGBs increases. Similar patterns were seen for SGB richness (Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). Only non-significant (NS) false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected P values (Q > 0.01, two-sided Mann–Whitney U-test) are annotated. Box plots as in Fig. 1. d, Meta-analysis of the 50 most favourable and unfavourable SGBs comparing participants of healthy weight with those with obesity from public cohorts. Lower BMI is associated with more favourable SGBs; people with higher BMI carry more unfavourable SGBs. Meta-analysis on ranks defined on UK and US participants shows reproducibility across countries. Other comparisons are in Extended Data Fig. 8 and the diet-ranked SGBs meta-analysis in Extended Data Fig. 9.

To generalize these associations, we leveraged a total of 5,348 healthy individuals from 27 public cohorts divided into three BMI categories, healthy weight (n = 2,837), overweight (n = 1,562) and obese (n = 949; Supplementary Table 9 and Methods). In 47 pairwise comparisons, 34 had a higher median richness for the 50 most favourably ranked ZOE MB health SGBs in lower BMI groups versus higher BMI groups (binomial P = 0.003; Supplementary Table 10 and Supplementary Fig. 3a), and this was not dependent on country effects or sequencing depth (Supplementary Table 11), highlighting the generalization of the identified ranks. Meta-analysis based on linear regression on single cohorts (Methods) showed that individuals with healthy weight carried, on average, 5.2 more of the 50 favourably ZOE MB health-ranked SGBs than people with obesity (P = 0.0003; Fig. 3d and Supplementary Table 12), which corresponded to a normalized difference in the cumulative abundances of unfavourably and favourably ranked SGBs of Cohen's d = −0.59 (P < 0.0001; Supplementary Tables 10 and 13 and Methods). Correspondingly, individuals with obesity carried, on average, 1.95 more of the unfavourably ranked SGBs than people of healthy weight (P = 0.0005; Fig. 3d, Supplementary Tables 14 and 15; Cohen's d on cumulative relative abundances = 0.29; P = 0.0001). Pairwise analysis of the other BMI categories confirmed these results (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 10 and 12–15).

Similarly, we tested the association of the 50 most favourably and unfavourably ZOE MB diet-ranked SGBs with BMI, and found similar but milder signals compared with the ZOE MB health-ranks (average Spearman's correlations between the two ranks and BMI of 0.61 and 0.72, respectively; Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 7a). Using public datasets, 36 intra-dataset comparisons out of 47 showed a higher median cumulative abundance and a higher median richness of the 50 most favourable SGBs in lower BMI classes compared with higher BMIs (binomial P = 0.0003; Supplementary Fig. 3b). Conversely, 36 comparisons showed a higher median count of the least favourable 50 SGBs for the higher BMI classes compared with the lower BMI groups (binomial P = 0.0003; Supplementary Table 10). The contribution of diet-ranked SGBs in different BMI categories similarly showed a decreasing number and cumulative relative abundance of favourably ranked SGBs and an increase in unfavourably ranked SGBs (Extended Data Fig. 7d–g). In meta-analysis, healthy weight and overweight participants carried 3.5 and 1.5 more favourable diet-ranked SGBs, and 1.25 and 0.88 fewer unfavourable ZOE MB diet-ranked SGBs than obesity participants, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 9, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Tables 16–19). All these analyses were confirmed when rankings were computed without adjusting for BMI (Extended Data Fig. 7h–k) and, altogether, these results suggest that the ZOE MB health- and diet-ranks can stratify people based on their obesity status regardless of geography.

Next, we assessed whether the ZOE MB health-ranked SGBs had a differential presence or abundance in control participants compared with participants with a defined disease condition, exploiting 25 case–control, publicly available microbiome studies (4,816 samples in total with n = 2,707 controls and n = 2,109 cases; Methods) investigating five diseases with variable levels of association with the gut microbiome (Supplementary Table 20). The number of the 50 most favourably ZOE MB health-ranked SGBs was higher in controls than cases for 21 of the 25 cohorts, whereas the count of the 50 most unfavourably ranked SGBs was correspondingly higher in cases for the same number of cohorts (binomial P = 0.0004).

We performed a meta-analysis on the count of the 50 most favourable and unfavourable SGBs from the ZOE MB health- and diet-rankings. Control samples carried, on average, 3.6 more favourably ranked SGBs than participants with disease (random-effect model, P = 0.0002; Methods) and 1.6 fewer unfavourable SGBs (P = 0.0004; Supplementary Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 21). Similarly, for the ZOE MB diet-ranked SGBs, controls carried, on average, 3.8 more favourable SGBs and 1.3 fewer unfavourable SGBs, P = 9.5×10−6 and P = 0.0006, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 21). Furthermore, meta-analyses of the cumulative abundance of the 50 most favourable and unfavourable SGBs confirmed a greater contribution from favourable species in control groups and of unfavourable SGBs in the corresponding disease groups (meta-analysis Cohen's d = −0.29, P = 7.1 × 10−6 and d = 0.21, P = 0.054 for the ZOE MB health-ranks; d = −0.24, P = 3.1 × 10−6 and d = 0.28, P = 0.0002 for the ZOE MB diet-ranks; Fig. 3e and Supplementary Table 22).

To assess how informative the rankings are in summarizing the health-associated status of a single sample, we scored all metagenomes from diseased and control participants by summing the normalized ZOE MB health-ranks of the SGBs present in the sample (Methods). We found a strong separation between diseased and control participants (meta-analysis Cohen's d = −0.37, P = 8.3 × 10−8), improving over the simple counting of the number of most favourable and unfavourable SGBs (Fig. 3f). Notably, T2D showed the strongest disease-specific association (meta-analysis Cohen's d = −0.47, P = 6.78 × 10−5; Fig. 3f and Supplementary Table 23) with the weighted version of this score showing an even stronger effect for T2D (meta-analysis Cohen's d = −0.51, P = 0.0002). People were also scored using the ZOE MB diet-ranks, and similar links with their health status emerged (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Table 23). Notably, standard alpha diversity measures such as gut SGBs richness and Shannon's entropy measures showed weaker and less consistent associations, with significant links only in the IBD and T2D comparisons (Supplementary Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 24).

Although the ranking-based scoring of single samples cannot have the same predictive power for host phenotypes compared with condition-specific supervised learning approaches relying directly on labelled training data, our results showed how embedding the ranking system into a simple one-dimensional microbiome index provides a meaningful evaluation of microbiome health conditions.

To validate the effect of dietary changes on the presence and abundance of gut microbial species according to their ZOE MB health-rankings, we analysed two dietary intervention studies, namely ZOE METHOD36 and BIOME37 (ClinicalTrials.gov registrations, NCT05273268 and NCT06231706, respectively). In brief, the ZOE METHOD cohort comprised n = 347 people assigned to a personalized dietary intervention programme (PDP; n = 177) arm versus an arm with general diet advice following the US Department of Agriculture recommendations (control, n = 170). People assigned to the PDP group showed lower energy intake and a significant decrease in triglycerides, HbA1c, weight and waist circumference after 18 weeks36. The ZOE BIOME cohort comprised n = 349 healthy adults (intention-to-treat) randomized into the primary intervention group (receiving a defined prebiotic blend, n = 116), the functional control group (receiving bread croutons to match the calories in the control group, n = 120) and the daily probiotic group (supplemented with 15 billion colony-forming units of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus per day, n = 113). Overall, weight, waist circumference, metabolites and gastrointestinal symptoms did not differ significantly between groups37.

We identified which microbiome species were impacted significantly by the dietary interventions in the two cohorts. In the ZOE BIOME cohort, 57, 4 and 14 prevalent SGBs showed significant changes at the endpoint (Q < 0.01) for the prebiotic blend, probiotic and control arm, respectively (Fig. 4a). Among the species with a significant change in the prebiotic arm were beneficial fibre-degrading Bifidobacterium adolescentis (SGB17244), Bifidobacterium longum (SGB17248) and Blautia obeum (SGB4811)38,39,40, as well as butyrate-producing Agathobaculum butyriciproducens (SGB14993), Anaerobutyricum hallii (SGB4532) and Coprococcus catus (SGB4670)41,42. By contrast, the species Dysosmobacter welbionis (SGB15078), among the top unfavourably associated SGBs in our study, was decreased significantly by the same dietary intervention (Supplementary Table 25). In the ZOE METHOD cohort, we found 46 SGBs differed significantly in their relative abundance in the PDP arm, and only two in the control arm (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 25; Wilcoxon signed-rank test Q < 0.1). Of note, the prominent butyrate producers Roseburia hominis (SGB4936) and A. butyriciproducens (SGB14993) were also found to increase in the PDP intervention.

The plots show the effect size (log2-transformed ratio of mean relative SGB abundance at endpoint over baseline) against the significance (Q values, FDR–Benjamini–Hochberg-corrected P values). a, BIOME cohort (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06231706) with n = 321 healthy adults from the UK (n = 106 prebiotic blend, n = 106 probiotic and n = 109 control), significance threshold set to Q < 0.01. b, METHOD cohort (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05273268) with n = 347 US individuals (n = 177 PDP, n = 170 control), and significance threshold set to Q < 0.1. c, Change in relative abundance for the significant SGBs in the intervention arms of BIOME (prebiotic blend, n = 57). d, Change in relative abundance of METHOD (PDP, n = 46), separated into those that increase from those that decrease from baseline (B) to endpoint (E). Extended Data Fig. 10a–d reports the change in relative abundance and prevalence of the control and prebiotic arms. Two-sided Wilcoxon test; box plots as in Fig. 1).

The dietary intervention groups of both clinical trials that aimed at improving diet using different approaches (prebiotic blend for BIOME and PDP for METHOD) showed the highest number of significantly changing SGBs (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 25). Focusing on the most significant gut microbial SGBs with largest change in relative abundance after dietary interventions, we found increasing Bifidobacterium animalis (SGB17278)—a bacterium present in dairy-based foods and in the microbiome of people consuming larger amounts of them43,44 (Fig. 5a,b and Supplementary Table 25), an unknown Lachnospiraceae bacterium (SGB4953, BIOME; Fig. 5a) and R. hominis (SGB4936, METHOD; Fig. 5b) both previously associated with a vegan diet43, and another unknown Lachnospiraceae bacterium (SGB5200, BIOME; Fig. 5a) linked to a vegetarian diet43. Butyricimonas paravirosa (SGB1785, METHOD; Fig. 5b), Phocea massiliensis (SGB14837), a currently uncharacterized Ruminococcaceae species (SGB14899) and Candidatus Pararuminococcus gallinarum (SGB63327) (all found in the BIOME cohort; Fig. 5a), were instead decreasing in the intervention and reported to be associated with a mixed diet43. The Streptococcus salivarius (SGB8007, METHOD; Fig. 5b) species was also found in food microbiomes45 and, together with an unknown Ruminococcaceae species (SGB14899, BIOME; Fig. 5a), were found associated with non-vegans43.

The x axis shows the log2-transformed ratio of mean relative abundance SGB values at endpoint over baseline. All values are reported in Supplementary Table 25. c,d, The distributions of the ZOE MB health-ranks (c) and diet-ranks (d) for the prebiotic blend arm of the BIOME cohort (n = 57 of tested SGBs). e,f, The distributions of the ZOE MB health-ranks (e) and diet-ranks (f) for the PDP arm of the METHOD cohort (n = 46 of tested SGBs). The distributions show that SGBs increasing in relative abundance have significantly more favourable ranks, whereas decreasing SGBs have more unfavourable ranks (two-sided Mann–Whitney U-test, P = 7.78 × 10−3, P = 3.00 × 10−5, P = 5.20 × 10−5 and P = 2.03 × 10−5, respectively). Distributions of the ZOE MB health-ranks and diet-ranks for the other arms are reported in Extended Data Fig. 10e,f. Box plots as in Fig. 1.

We found that the SGBs with increased relative abundance at endpoint in the prebiotic blend arm of the BIOME trial (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 25) showed significantly more favourable ZOE MB health-ranks and diet-ranks than the decreasing SGBs (Fig. 5c,d, Mann–Whitney U-test P = 7.78 × 10−3 and P = 3.00 × 10−5, respectively). This was confirmed for the PDP arm of the METHOD cohort (Fig. 5e,f; Mann–Whitney U-test P = 5.20 × 10−5 and P = 2.03 × 10−3, respectively). No significant enrichment for ZOE MB health- and diet-rankings was instead detected for the significantly changing SGBs for the probiotic group of the BIOME cohort or the control groups of both BIOME and METHOD cohorts (Extended Data Fig. 10e,f).

Together, these results show how dietary interventions or tailored prebiotic blends, both aiming at improving diet quality, positively modulate the microbiome composition. The SGBs' rankings (ZOE MB health and diet), which were defined on cross-sectional independent cohorts, were strongly and consistently predictive of the SGBs most associated with the dietary interventions in independent cohorts and countries, supporting the direct, reproducible and actionable link between diet and microbiome composition.

Defining the baseline composition of the human gut microbiome in ‘healthy' host conditions has been a long-standing challenge. This area has several problems, including defining general host health across age, as well as the inter-population microbiome variability, the existence of several distinct health-associated microbiome configurations19,46, the personalized nature of diet's impact on the gut microbiome16,47, the diversity of dietary regimes48,49 and the effect of social interaction on microbiome transmission44. To address this challenge, we reformulated the question of what a health-associated microbiome is by scoring gut microbiome species for their tendency to be correlated with healthy diet scores and with the continuum of a panel of intermediate markers of cardiometabolic health, in large and generally healthy populations. By leveraging diet scores such as the healthy eating index or the healthful PDI, and health estimators such as blood glucose, HDL and triglycerides, we identified species that are expected to characterize hosts in healthier conditions, as well as other species that are enriched in hosts with more unfavourable health risk factors. Most of the key health-associated species were from previously uncharacterized species, underlining the wide knowledge gap of the microbiome composition in non-diseased conditions. These rankings, named ZOE MB health-ranks and diet-ranks, are released and maintained publicly (Supplementary Table 5 and ‘Data availability' section) and can be adopted by the research community to evaluate whether a given human gut microbiome sample is characterized by a more favourable or unfavourable diet and health-associated species.

Several factors were crucial in the robust definition of the proposed microbiome species ranking systems. First, the scale of our combined cohorts with consistent experimental protocols for metagenomic sequencing and analysis is unprecedented. Second, the geographic diversity spanning all US states and UK regions, although confined to typical Westernized lifestyles and diets, allowed us to overcome local lifestyle-associated microbiome configurations. Third, consistent long- and short-term diet logging data processed in an integrative quantitative approach and validated markers that are intermediary measures of cardiometabolic health, and more advanced postprandial metabolomic-derived markers, enabled a fine-grained definition of relative health gradients across the surveyed populations. Fourth, publicly available datasets that were processed and curated uniformly, permitted independent validation and generalization of the results and showed the relevance of the species rankings toward additional conditions and diseases not evaluated in the original populations. We acknowledge that the demographic composition of the cohorts may influence some associations, and we are continuing to expand in both population scale and precision of each host-associated readout.

Our microbiome species ranking system proved accurate in reflecting changes induced by large-scale dietary intervention trials with associated host marker improvements (Figs. 4 and 5). Indeed, the cross-sectional associations were reflected in a significant and substantial increase of health-associated microbiome species and a reduction or depletion of unfavourably ranked species. Many health-associated host markers are co-correlated because they are nutritional indicators, and disentangling their direct interactions from those mediated by the microbiome will remain elusive until large-scale microbiome interventions become possible in humans. In this respect, one key limitation of our study design is that it does not allow directly disentangling of the effect that diet exerts on the microbiome to improve cardiometabolic health from the impact of diet only. This is particularly important as diet-based ranks were more dependent on country-related differences compared with health ranks, and further studies should explore food-specific links with gut microbial species and cardiometabolic outcomes in greater detail50. This would entail designing large-scale interventions in which both the introduction of single foods and alterations of specific microbiome characteristics (for example, by administration of specific microbiome members) are tested, which are ultimately required to provide causal evidence that personalized nutritional interventions targeting the microbiota have a robust and reproducible impact on cardiometabolic health. Nonetheless, the confirmation of the cross-sectional patterns along the diet–microbiome–health axis in longitudinal nutrition intervention trials not only increases the intrinsic value of the rankings but confirms that the human gut microbiome can be modulated successfully by dietary intervention and that the effects on the microbiome of such interventions are both predictable and reproducible. By providing the full list of ranked microbial species, this work can be exploited in future research on microbiome-powered precision nutrition and can be expanded in the future to more diverse populations and lifestyles that are currently underrepresented in microbiome, nutritional and health studies.

The ZOE PREDICT programme comprises several distinct studies that together constitute one of the largest multi-omic health initiatives, linking diet, person-specific metabolic responses to foods, and the gut microbiome. In this work, we considered and harmonized five ZOE PREDICT cohorts: PREDICT 1, PREDICT 2, PREDICT 3 US21, PREDICT 3 US22A, and PREDICT 3 UK22A. The PREDICT 1 cohort (NCT03479866) was described previously9,51. In brief, PREDICT 1 enrolled 1,098 participants (n = 1,001 from the UK and n = 97 from the USA) who underwent a clinical visit to collect anthropometric information and blood samples, followed by an at-home phase during which postprandial responses to both standardized tests and ad libitum meals were recorded. Stool samples were collected at home before the in-person clinical visit. The PREDICT 2 study (NCT03983733) had a similar collection protocol to PREDICT 1 but was conducted entirely remotely and included data from 975 people from 48 US states (including the federal District of Columbia and without participants from North Dakota and Hawaii). The PREDICT 3 cohorts (US21, US22A and UK22A) are research cohorts (NCT04735835) embedded within the ZOE commercial product. Participants provide informed written consent for their data to be used for scientific research purposes. In total, 32,621 samples (n = 11,798 for US21, n = 8,470 for US22A and n = 12,353 UK22A) were collected and retrieved. The studies were fully remote, participants completed health and food questionnaires at baseline, and self-collected and shipped stool samples. Cardiometabolic markers were collected as described below. Furthermore, we considered and analysed two registered clinical nutritional intervention studies, namely METHOD36 (NCT05273268) and BIOME37 (NCT06231706), focusing on the microbiome changes and their links with the two derived SGB-level rankings (ZOE MB health-ranks and diet-ranks). All study protocols are registered and available on clinicaltrials.gov through the clinical trials number and link affiliated with each trial.

For the PREDICT 1 cohort, sample collection, DNA extraction and sequencing were described previously9. The PREDICT 2 samples were collected in Zymo buffer, DNA extraction was performed at QIAGEN Genomic Services using DNeasy 96 PowerSoil Pro, and sequencing was performed on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform using the S4 flow cell and targeting 7.5 Gb per sample. The PREDICT 3 samples were self-collected into tubes containing the DNA-Shield Zymo buffer. Sample processing was performed by Zymo and Prebiomics. In brief, DNA extraction by Zymo used the ZymoBIOMICS-96 MagBead DNA kit, whereas Prebiomics used the DNeasy 96 PowerSoil Pro kits. Sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina DNA Prep Tagmentation kit, following the manufacturer's guidelines. Whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform used the S4 flow cell and targetted 3.75 Gb per sample.

All raw sequenced data were quality controlled using the preprocessing pipeline available at https://github.com/SegataLab/preprocessing, which comprises three steps: (1) removal of reads with low-quality (Q < 20), too short (length under 75 nt), or with more than two ambiguous bases; (2) removal of host contaminant DNAs (Illumina's spike-in phiX 174 and human genomes, hg19); and (3) synchronization of paired-end and unpaired reads.

In the PREDICT cohorts, we assessed long-term food intakes using FFQs, which were largely consistent across cohorts. Specifically, for PREDICT 1 participants (UK), we used a modified 131-item European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) FFQ52. Participants in PREDICT 2 (USA) were surveyed using a similarly validated Diet History Questionnaire-III FFQ, including 135 items about food and beverages, as well as 26 questions about dietary supplements53. In PREDICT 3 UK22A and US22A, we developed and used a 264-item FFQ adapted from the EPIC-Norfolk Study FFQ and the Diet History Questionnaire-III. Consequently, there is a large overlap between the food items collected across the FFQs; for example, 90% of questions in the EPIC FFQ are included in the PREDICT 3 FFQ. This FFQ also includes additional food items to accurately capture modern eating habits—a limitation of older FFQ versions54. In the PREDICT 3 US21 cohort, FFQs were not collected, and only short-term logged dietary data collected using the ZOE mobile phone app were used instead.

Starting from both long- and short-term dietary data, we computed three versions of the PDI55, namely, the overall PDI, the healthful PDI (measuring the adherence to a healthier plant-based foods diet) and the unhealthy PDI (measuring the intake of unhealthful plant-based foods), as well as the healthy eating index23 (measuring how consumed foods align with dietary guidelines), the alternative Mediterranean diet score (measuring the adherence to a Mediterranean diet)56 and the Healthy Food Diversity (HFD) index (measuring the number, distribution and health value of consumed foods)57. Specifically, to calculate PDIs and the healthy eating index, food items were first assembled into food groups by mapping them onto a ‘food tree' consisting of a database of nutrient information arranged according to a hierarchical tree structure: level 1 (9 food groups), level 2 (52 food groups) and level 3 (195 food groups). UK foods were mapped onto the Composition of Foods Integrated Dataset (CoFID)58 using food categories or sub-group codes, whereas US foods were similarly mapped onto the US Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies database. Level 3 foods were aggregated and harmonized by nutrition scientists to allow for comparisons across cohorts. The Mediterranean diet and HFD scores were calculated as described previously9.

In PREDICT 1, sex and age were self-reported, whereas height, weight and blood pressure were measured at a clinic visit (day 0). At the clinic visit, participants were also fitted with wearable continuous glucose monitor CGM) devices (Abbott Freestyle Libre Pro (FSL)), visceral fat mass was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans following standard manufacturer's recommendations (DXA; Hologic QDR 4500 plus) and fasting GlycA was measured using a high-throughput NMR metabolomics (Nightingale Health) 2016 panel. Fasting and postprandial venous blood samples were also collected at the clinic; plasma glucose and serum total cholesterol, HDL-C and triglycerides were measured using Affinity 1.0, and whole blood HbA1c% was measured using Viapath. The ten-year ASCVD risk was calculated as per the 2019 American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) clinical guidelines59. Additional data were collected over the subsequent 13-day period at home; postprandial responses to eight standardized meals (seven in duplicate) of differing macronutrient (fat, carbohydrate, protein and fibre) content were measured using CGMs and dried-blood-spot analysis as described previously13. T2D and hyperlipidemia were self-reported via health questionnaires. The PREDICT 2 and PREDICT 3 studies were fully remote. Sex, age, height, weight and blood pressure were self-reported, and fasting and postprandial responses for total cholesterol, HDL-C, triglycerides and HbA1c were assessed using whole blood finger-prick samples collected at home using dried-blood-spot analysis by commercial laboratories (CRL, Eurofins Biomnis). CGMs were fitted at home by participants. A selection of standardized meals smaller than in PREDICT 1 was tested in PREDICT 2 and PREDICT 3 (a metabolic challenge meal, and medium-fat and carbohydrate breakfast and lunch meals). Some of the considered markers represent the same metabolic function over time and showed positive correlations between their fasting and postprandial measurements, whereas others represent opposite types of the same biomolecular pathway and showed negative correlations among them (Supplementary Table 4).

We leveraged 27,011 public metagenomic samples from 107 cohorts available through the curated MetagenomicData 3 (cMD3) resource60,61 to define the cohorts used for the meta-analyses on BMI and healthy–diseased comparison (‘Statistical and meta-analyses'). For the meta-analysis on BMI, we selected cohorts with stool microbiome samples from healthy participants (self-assessed, not reporting a diagnosis), aged at least 16 years, BMI ≥ 18.5 and sex information available. Cohorts with fewer than 30 people were excluded. Furthermore, the ThomasAM_2018_c and LeChatelier_2013 cohorts were excluded as duplicates in the YachidaS_2019 and NiesenHB_2014 cohorts, respectively. Overall, 6,182 samples from 34 different cohorts and 20 countries were retrieved. Participants were classified into three categories: healthy weight (BMI ≥ 18.5 and <25), overweight (BMI ≥ 25 and <30) and obese (BMI ≥ 30). Then, each combination of country, dataset and two BMI categories was tested if at least 15 samples were retained. These led to analysing a total of 5,348 samples from 27 cohorts (2,837 healthy weight, 1,562 overweight and 949 obese participants; Supplementary Table 9). For the health–diseased meta-analyses, we selected from cMD3 participants aged at least 16 years, BMI ≥ 18.5 and the sex information available that were part of a case–control study of one of the following diseases: CRC, IBD (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), T2D, IGT and ASCVD. Studies with fewer than 30 people were excluded. In total, we considered ten datasets of CRC (650 cases and 645 controls), two datasets of IGT (273 cases and 492 controls), five datasets of T2D (775 cases and 900 controls), three datasets of IBD (103 controls, 59 of which used in two different comparisons, 60 individuals with Crohn's disease and 68 individuals with ulcerative colitis) and three datasets of CVD (283 cases and 508 controls). Notably, German and French participants of the MetaCardis cohort were separated, and this led to a set of 449 controls used in both the T2D and the IGT analyses, whereas only the 176 controls from France were used in the CVD analysis. Overall, the total number of samples analysed was N = 4,816 (2,707 controls and 2,109 cases) from 25 cohorts and 10 countries (Supplementary Table 20). The cohort selection for the two analyses used the script https://github.com/waldronlab/curatedMetagenomicDataAnalyses/blob/main/python_tools/meta_analysis_data.py available in cMD3.

All microbiome samples from the PREDICT cohorts were profiled using MetaPhlAn 4 (v.4.beta.2, database vJan21_CHOCOPhlAnSGB_202103), without performing read subsampling, as the benefit of occasionally detecting a few additional low-abundance species in samples with a higher number of reads outweighs the potential noise from uneven sequencing depth. Samples retrieved from cMD3 (described in ‘Public human microbiome datasets') were profiled with MetaPhlAn 4 (v.4.beta.1, database vJan21_CHOCOPhlAnSGB_202103) using default parameters in both cases (among default parameters, the stat_q is set to 0.2 by default, which defines the quantiles for the robust average coverage calculation), which precludes the necessity for additional prevalence filters considering its default parameters are tailored for the taxonomic profiling of human microbiome samples19. MetaPhlAn 4 is a publicly available taxonomic profiler for metagenomic samples (Github repository: https://github.com/biobakery/MetaPhlAn) that leverages medium and high-quality genomes from isolates and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Isolate genomes and MAGs are clustered at 95% average nucleotide identity to define SGBs, as described previously20. If an SGB cluster contains a genome isolate, then it is referred to by that isolate's taxonomic label. If an SGB contains only MAGs, then it represents an unknown species cluster and is assigned the taxonomic label of a genus, family or phylum, according to which is the genomically closest to a taxonomic label from isolate genomes. As the taxonomic classification of MetaPhlAn depends on species-specific marker genes, sometimes there are several SGBs of very closely related genomes for which the identification of SGB-specific markers is not feasible. In this case, more than one SGB can be considered together, and the label ‘_group' is appended to the representative SGB ID. In this way, MetaPhlAn 4 improves the resolution of the taxonomic profiling task62.

We first identified a subset of prevalent SGBs to ensure a minimum number of non-zero relative abundance values. In each PREDICT cohort, we selected markers that are intermediary measures of host health or diet health, and they were organized into four categories: personal, dietary, fasting and postprandial (Supplementary Table 2). Second, we calculated the partial Spearman's correlation between each SGB and health markers, adjusting for sex, age and BMI, using the ‘pingouin' Python package (v.0.5.4, https://github.com/raphaelvallat/pingouin) (Extended Data Figs. 3 and 5). The relative abundance values of SGBs (including zeros) were used as input for the correlations. Third, the SGB-marker partial correlations were sorted ascending if the marker was considered as positive with respect to health, or descending if the marker was considered as negative. These sorted partial correlations were ranked and normalized according to cohort sample sizes into percentiles ranging from 0 to 1 (function pandas.DataFrame.rank with param pct=True from pandas v.2.1.3) (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 4). Fourth, for each category of markers, we computed the average percentiles across markers (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 4). SGBs were retained in the overall rankings if they were ranked in at least two different cohorts, leading to a final ranking of 661 SGBs. Finally, the ZOE MB health-rank 2025 was defined by first averaging the personal, fasting and postprandial category percentiles within each cohort, and then averaging these cohort-specific averages. The ZOE MB diet-rank 2025 instead was defined by averaging the dietary percentiles across all cohorts (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 5). The ZOE Microbiome Rankings are also available at https://zoe.com/our-science/microbiome-ranking.

To assess the link to the human gut microbiome composition, we developed and used a machine learning framework based on random forest classification and regression algorithms from the scikit-learn (v.1.3.2) Python package (as implemented in the RandomForestClassifier and RandomForestRegressor functions, respectively), both with ‘n_estimators=1000' and ‘max_features=sqrt' parameters63. We trained random forest classifiers and regressors on MetaPhlAn 4-estimated SGB-level relative abundances (arcsine square-root transformed) to assess the extent to which the outcome variable was predictable from the microbiome as a proxy of the strength of the microbiome–variable association. This framework was used and described originally in ref. 9 and accounts for the presence of twin pairs in the data, which avoids biases due to identical values in twins. In brief, the framework uses a cross-validation approach, splitting the dataset randomly into training and testing folds with an 80:20 ratio, respectively, and repeated 100 times (as implemented in the StratifiedShuffleSplit function). Folds are also constructed to maintain a similar ratio of the two classes to predict as they appear in the full data. For target variables with continuous values, classification was performed by contrasting the first against the fourth quartile, the first three against the fourth quartile and the first against the last three quartiles. Performances were evaluated using the AUC for the classification task, whereas Spearman's correlation between the real and predicted values was used for the regression task22.

We performed a meta-analysis to determine the possible links between BMI (categorized into ‘healthy weight', ‘overweight' and ‘obese') and our ranked SGBs across various publicly available studies comprising a total of 5,348 people who were not diagnosed with any specific disease. We first evaluated the ZOE MB health- and diet-ranks by assessing the cumulative relative abundance and richness of the 50 most favourable and the 50 least favourable SGBs in each dataset in each BMI category: healthy weight, overweight and obese (see ‘Public human microbiome datasets' for the specific cut-offs). Specifically, we assessed the number of intra-dataset, between-BMI groups pairwise comparisons in which the group median abundance or the group median count was higher in the lower BMI group (when considering most favourable SGBs from both ranks) or higher in the higher BMI group (when looking at least favourable SGBs). Next, we fit linear models for each dataset and pair of BMI categories: healthy weight versus overweight, healthy weight versus obese, and overweight versus obese. In the first model, we looked at the count of the 50 most favourable and unfavourable ZOE MB health- and diet-ranked SGBs. A second model was fitted on the cumulative relative abundance (arcsine square-root transformed) of the 50 most favourable and unfavourable SGBs in the two rankings. All models were adjusted by sex and age. Cohen's d was used to estimate the effect size of the normalized difference between unfavourable and favourable ranked SGBs when considering cumulative abundances. This quantifies the difference between the means of two groups in terms of standard deviations. Specifically, as originally defined, a ‘small' effect size corresponds to d = 0.2, a ‘medium' effect size to d = 0.5 and a ‘large' effect size to d = 0.8 (ref. 64). In these models, the lower BMI category of each comparison was used as the negative control, so negative coefficients reflect a higher count of SGBs in the lower BMI category, whereas positive coefficients reflect a higher count of SGBs in the higher BMI category. Effect sizes were summarized through meta-analysis, computed as a random-effect model using the Paule–Mandel heterogeneity on adjusted mean differences from the linear regression models (standardized for cumulative abundances). We assessed the presence of the 50 most favourable and most unfavourable SGBs from both the ZOE MB health- and diet-ranks among the countries considered in these analyses (18 in total) and when considering only people of healthy weight (n = 2,837). To link the ranked SGBs with the country, we fit a linear model on the count and cumulative relative abundance of the SGBs, and the models were adjusted by the sequencing depth of the study. We used ordinary least squares adjusted by sequencing depth when comparing two datasets from different countries, and linear mixed model blocked by dataset ID and adjusted by sequencing depth when comparing pairs of countries in which at least one country was represented by more than one dataset (country- and sequencing depth-adjusted P values are presented in Supplementary Table 11).

A second meta-analysis tested the associations between our ZOE MB health- and diet-ranked SGBs and five gut-associated diseases (CVD, T2D, IBD, CRC and IGT) across studies, for a total of 4,816 samples (‘Public human microbiome datasets'). Linear models were used to predict the binary disease outcome (healthy versus diseased) for each disease, using the cumulative abundances (arcsine square-root transformed) of the 50 most favourable or unfavourable SGBs, adjusting by sex, age and BMI. The betas of the linear models were converted into SMDs as described previously65. We also defined models to predict healthy versus diseased using the sum of the SGB ranks normalized between −1 and 1, considering all 661 SGBs for the ZOE MB health- and diet-ranks, once using the direct sum of the SGB ranks and once weighting ranks by the relative abundance of each SGB in each sample (transformed using the arcsine and square-root function to avoid overestimating the ranks of highly abundant species due to compositionality). SMDs were calculated similarly to those in the previous case. In all meta-analytical models, the set of cohorts considered comprised studies encompassing several diseases with a shared control group that we analysed separately. To account for the overlaps in the studies considered, we computed weights based on the inverse effect sizes variance-covariance matrix, as suggested previously66,67. Thus, five meta-analyses were performed, one for each disease: CVD (three datasets), T2D (six datasets), IBD (three datasets), CRC (ten datasets) and IGT (two datasets). Of note, in the comparisons of controls versus T2D, IGT and CVD, the MetaCardis French and German sub-cohorts were considered as different datasets, and their controls were meta-analysed as different cohorts. In particular, only French control samples were used in the CVD analysis, which included only French cases. Finally, meta-analysis summaries were computed using the same technique. Analyses we carried out with Python (v.3.12.0), using also the following libraries: numpy (v.1.26.2), scipy (v.1.11.4), statsmodels (v.0.14.0), and matplotlib (v.3.8.2) and seabron (v.0.11.2) for visualization.

Distributions of the random forest median AUCs (a) and median Spearman's correlation coefficients (b) (Methods) in the five cross-sectional PREDICT studies for the different clinical data divided into four categories: ‘Personal', ‘Dietary', ‘Fasting', and ‘Postprandial'. The AUC and Spearman's index thresholds of 0.7 and 0.3, respectively, are indicated with a dashed line. a) Each point represents the median AUC value obtained in cross-validation for each cohort when testing the first versus the fourth quartile of the corresponding clinical marker values on the x-axis. b) Each point represents the median Spearman's correlation coefficient for the predicted values by the regressor and the true values in the cross-validation setting for each cohort.

The single-marker percentiles, divided into the three categories (‘Personal', ‘Fasting', and ‘Postprandial') for the 15 most favorable and unfavorable ZOE MB Health-ranked SGBs the other three PREDICT cohorts not reported in Fig. 2 (a, PREDICT3 UK22A; b, PREDICT2, and c, PREDICT3 US21). Heatmaps with the single Spearman's partial correlations for all PREDICT cohorts are available in Supplementary Fig. 4.

a-e) Spearman's partial correlations (corrected for age, sex, and BMI) between SGB relative abundance and single marker values show consistency across the five PREDICT cohorts. These partial correlations were ranked and averaged first within and then across the three data categories (‘Personal', ‘Fasting', and ‘Postprandial', reported in Supplementary Fig. 3) separately in each cohort. The cohorts' averages were then used to define the cardiometabolic rank (for those SGBs analyzed in at least two cohorts).

a-e) For each PREDICT cohort, we computed Spearman's partial correlation between the SGBs' relative abundances and different diet indexes. Associations were ranked and averaged in each cohort separately. f) The ZOE MB Diet-ranking was computed for SGBs ranked in at least two PREDICT cohorts. The raw Spearman's partial correlations are available in Supplementary Fig. 7.

a-e) Study-wise Spearman's partial correlation coefficients (corrected for sex, age, and BMI) for the 15 most favorable and unfavorable ZOE MB Diet-ranked SGBs in different diet indexes. The associations appear consistent across cohorts.

a) The ZOE MB Health and Diet ranks are overall in agreement (Spearman's correlation = 0.72), albeit some SGBs show discordant rankings (absolute difference between the two ranks ≥ 0.3). These SGBs are highlighted in orange, and their ranks and taxonomy assignment are reported in Supplementary Table 6. b,c) Comparison of the ZOE MB Health (b) and Diet (c) ranks computed only on the PREDICT UK and US cohorts (Spearman's correlations of 0.61 and 0.26, respectively). The top and right-side histograms depict the x and y-axis marginal distributions in each plot.

a) Comparison of the ZOE MB Diet-ranks (x-axis) with the Spearman's partial correlations (corrected for sex and age, y-axis) for the 661 ranked SGBs in the five PREDICT cohorts. b) The number of the 50 most-favorably ranked SGBs (ZOE MB Health-rank, Richness) detected in different BMI categories, showed that increasing BMI, linked with increasing health risks, is reflected by a lower presence of favorable SGBs. On the other hand, c) unfavorably-ranked SGBs show an increasing count in higher-risk BMI categories. d,e) The box plots report the number of the 50 most favorable and unfavorable ZOE MB Diet-ranked SGBs of individuals stratified into three BMI categories (healthy-weight, overweight, and obese) in each PREDICT cohort. f,g) Similarly, the box plots represent the cumulative relative abundance of the 50 most favorable and unfavorable ZOE MB Diet-ranked SGBs in individuals categorized into the three BMI categories in each cohort. h,i) The box plots report the number of the 50 most favorably and most unfavorably ranked SGBs, ranked using the same markers and categories as in the ZOE MB Health-ranks (Methods), but partial correlations were corrected only for sex and age. j,k) Similarly, the box plots report the count of the 50 most favorable and unfavorable SGBs in the three BMI categories, with SGBs ranked according to their partial correlation with BMI, adjusted by sex and age. Only non-significant FDR-corrected P values (ns, P value > 0.01) from the Mann-Whitney U test are reported.

a) Overweight individuals tend to carry a higher number of the 50 most favorably ZOE MB Health-ranked SGBs than obese individuals (left); the 50 most unfavorably ranked SGBs are increased in obese individuals vs overweight individuals (Methods). b) Healthy-weight individuals tend to carry a higher number of the 50 most favorably ZOE MB Health-ranked SGBs than overweight individuals (left); the 50 most unfavorably ranked SGBs are found in similar amounts in healthy-weight and overweight individuals (Methods). Error bars represent the 95% confidence interval.

a) Comparison of the number of the 50 most favorable Diet-ranked SGBs in pairs of BMI categories. Healthy-weight and overweight individuals tend to have a higher number of favorably-ranked SGBs than obese individuals (Methods). b) Comparison of the number of the 50 most unfavorably Diet-ranked SGBs in pairs of BMI categories. Obese individuals tend to have a higher number of unfavorably-ranked SGBs (Methods). Error bars represent the 95% confidence interval.

SGBs are separated into “increasing” and “decreasing”, depending on their trend in relative abundance values, showing that SGBs found to be increased in relative abundance are also more prevalent, while the opposite is observed for SGBs decreasing in relative abundance. e) Distributions of the ZOE MB Health ranks for the significant SGBs in the Probiotic and Control arms of the BIOME cohort and METHOD cohorts. f) Distributions of the ZOE MB Diet ranks for the significant SGBs in the Probiotic and Control arms of the BIOME and METHOD cohorts.

A new study identified 238 genomic regions that are associated with one of five categories of mental-health conditions (artist's illustration of DNA). Credit: Tumeggy/Science Photo Library

Psychiatrists have long relied on diagnostic manuals that regard most mental-health conditions as distinct from one another — depression, for instance, is listed as a separate disorder from anxiety. But a genetic analysis of more than one million people suggests that a host of psychiatric conditions have common biological roots.

The results, published today in Nature1, reveal that people with seemingly disparate conditions often share many of the same disease-linked genetic variants. The analysis found that 14 major psychiatric disorders cluster into five categories, each characterized by a common set of genetic risk factors. The neurodevelopmental category, for example, includes both attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism, which psychiatric handbooks classify as separate conditions.

Many supposedly individual conditions are “ultimately more overlapping than they are distinct, which should offer patients hope”, says study co-author Andrew Grotzinger, a psychiatric geneticist at the University of Colorado Boulder. “You can see the despair on someone's face [when] you give them five different labels as opposed to one label.”

Grotzinger says his team's work was motivated by the finding that people diagnosed with one mental-health condition are highly likely to be diagnosed with another one. For example, previous research has shown that most people diagnosed with depression have also been diagnosed with a condition called generalized anxiety disorder, and vice versa2.

Features of autism can affect age of diagnosis — and so can genes

Features of autism can affect age of diagnosis — and so can genes

To learn whether there is a biological explanation for these correlations, Grotzinger and his colleagues aggregated genomic data from more than one million people with psychiatric conditions and from millions of healthy controls.

The researchers found that the 14 mental-health conditions they studied generally fall into five distinct buckets, each with its own genetic profile. There's a schizophrenia/bipolar disorder category; an ‘internalizing' category that includes depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder; a neurodevelopmental category; and a compulsive category that includes obsessive-compulsive disorder and anorexia.

A final category includes substance-use disorders such as alcohol-use disorder and nicotine dependence. People whose genetic profile corresponds to a given bucket are at elevated risk of any of the conditions in that bucket. Other genetic and environmental triggers also affect risk.

The team then worked backwards from the categories that they had identified and found 238 specific genomic regions that are associated with at least one of these shared categories. For example, the researchers found that one region on chromosome 11 raised genetic risk for eight separate disorders, because the region codes for genes linked to dopamine signalling.

For the past few months, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has engaged in a sprawling and extremely public investigation of disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Keeping track of it all can be hard, even for the sharpest observers.

While initial public interest in what Epstein-related documents the federal government possesses has focused on investigative files held by the Department of Justice, the Oversight Committee's inquiry expands far past that. In addition to subpoenaing the DOJ, the committee has sent letters or issued subpoenas to several other entities, including the US Treasury Department, the Attorney General of the US Virgin Islands, the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein, and multiple banks.

In some cases, those entities were instructed to send separate copies of the same documents to both Democrats and Republicans on the committee. Those lawmakers have released their own selections of documents to the public, sometimes on the same day and sometimes consisting of overlapping sets of pages.

These releases have varied in format, from screenshots of multiple emails stitched together into a single PDF file, to a Google Drive link containing a 30,000-page dump still in an e-discovery format.

In short, it's kind of confusing to know what's been released, what hasn't, and what's still expected to come. WIRED reviewed letters and subpoenas sent by the House Oversight Committee, as well as what's been released so far to the public, to make clear what the many Epstein document releases entail and where the public can access them. And the Oversight Committee isn't the only part of the government working to release additional documents—the DOJ was recently granted motions to unseal grand jury materials by three different federal judges, and is expected to release an additional dump of documents later this month to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act.

Meanwhile, the Oversight Committee appears to be zeroing in on Epstein's financial records–in public statements, it has said that both the banks and the Treasury are complying with its requests, but it has yet to release documents from them. WIRED identified three gaps in the committee's releases from Epstein's estate, which a committee aide confirmed and said included information about Epstein's bank accounts and cash ledgers.

In early August, the committee subpoenaed Pam Bondi in her capacity as attorney general, requesting documents and communications related to the DOJ's lawsuits against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, the 2007 Florida investigation into Epstein, and Epstein's death, among other things.

An initial 33,295 pages of “Epstein-related records” were produced to the committee and later released in September. At the time, committee Democrats claimed that “97 percent of the pages included information previously released” by various law enforcement agencies. The documents include surveillance footage the night Epstein was found dead in his jail cell, public court filings from the investigations mentioned in the subpoena's requests for production, and a memo from Bondi to FBI director Kash Patel about releasing the Epstein files. (In other words, documents and communications related to the lawsuits.)

A press release from late November reiterated that the DOJ had produced “roughly 33,000 pages of records to date,” and the Oversight Committee had not released additional documents from the DOJ as of early December. Congress has since passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which will require the DOJ to publish all unclassified records related to the investigation and prosecution of Epstein “in a searchable and downloadable format” (much to the relief of those who plan on poring over what's released.)

In late August, US representative James Comer sent a letter to Treasury secretary Scott Bessent requesting Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and “accompanying material” related to Epstein and Maxwell. SARs in particular are closely guarded, and unauthorized disclosure of them is a violation of federal law.

The letter requested documents no later than September 15, 2025. An Oversight Committee press release from late November said that “the Department of Treasury is fully cooperating with the committee's request,” but so far no documents have been released to the public.

Others in Congress have been frustrated by how the Treasury has handled past requests related to Epstein. According to a September letter sent by Senator Ron Wyden to Bessent, staffers on the Senate Finance Committee were allowed to do what's called an “in camera review” of thousands of Treasury records related to Epstein's financial activities in February of last year, when President Joe Biden was still in office. While the staffers were given a limited time to view these records in person, the Treasury didn't hand over actual copies. Wyden wrote that not having the records was impeding his office's investigation into Epstein's finances, which has been ongoing since 2022.

Wyden recently introduced a bill called Produce Epstein Treasury Records Act that, if passed, would compel the Treasury to produce copies of certain documents to the Senate Finance Committee, including SARs related to Epstein and his associates.

In late August, the Oversight Committee subpoenaed the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein, naming co-executors Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn, and requesting 16 categories of documents with an initial deadline of September 8 for them to respond.

On the day of the initial deadline, the committee released documents related to four of the requests: the 2007 non-prosecution agreement between Epstein and the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, Epstein's will, and entries included in Epstein's equally infamous “Black Book” and “Birthday Book.” The committee later followed up with additional Black Book pages and unredacted versions of two pages previously included in the first release.

From there, things have ramped up, and the committee has started publishing releases in the style of legal e-discovery productions, often including both image and text versions of the same pages. Some of the releases include a load file that, in normal circumstances, contains information about which pages are supposed to be part of what document, along with other metadata that makes it easier to search through the pages using document review software. Other releases do not.

In October, the committee released thousands of additional pages of documents. Then in November, it released an additional tranche of around 20,000 pages. Many of these documents include emails from a Gmail inbox owned by Epstein, text messages, and documents related to court filings.

Notably, because all the pages released so far include what are called “Bates Numbers” in the bottom-right corner, it's possible to deduce that there are at least three gaps in what the committee has received so far from the Epstein estate and what it has released to the public. A committee aide confirmed to WIRED that these gaps include nondisclosure agreements and settlement documents, information about Epstein's bank accounts, and cash ledgers.

In November, the Oversight Committee issued subpoenas to J.P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank. The committee only published the cover letters for the subpoenas, so it's unclear what specific document requests were made. However, the cover letters both note that the committee was aware that Epstein held accounts at each of the banks.

On December 3, Oversight Committee Democrats noted in a press release that the committee had received records from both entities and intended to release files to the public after review.

Also in November, the Oversight Committee sent a letter to the US Virgin Islands attorney general, Gordon Rhea, requesting all documents the AG's office has related to any investigations into Epstein and Maxwell. The letter named two matters related to the Epstein Estate, and one case against J.P Morgan Chase.

While the committee Democrats recently released video and images of Epstein's compound, the committee has not yet released any other documents produced by the AG's office.

More document releases are expected this month. The Epstein Files Transparency Act requires the DOJ to release “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials” related to the investigation and prosecution of Epstein by December 19. Those documents are supposed to be released in a searchable format.

Democrats on the Oversight Committee also promised to release records they received from J.P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank, but didn't give a specific date to expect them.

Following the passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the DOJ filed several motions to unseal grand jury transcripts and exhibits related to matters involving Epstein and Maxwell. As of December 9, federal judges—one in Florida and two in New York—granted three of the government's motions, but those documents have not yet been released.

Meta is giving Instagram users a rare glimpse into why certain posts are showing up on their Reels, the platform's feed of algorithmically curated videos. Starting today, users will now see a list of what Instagram considers to be your top, recent interests. This kind of peek behind the algorithmic curtain is already uncommon in social media apps, but Meta is taking it a step further by allowing Instagram users to influence their algorithm directly by picking topics they want to see more or less often in Reels.

This feature, called “Your Algorithm,” drops as Instagram and TikTok continue to battle for prominence with younger users. It's these users who potentially want more control over what they're consuming as they scroll through videofeeds, as well as other personalization options. The new feature is landing on Instagram first for those in the US, with a global rollout for English users in the works.

The change arrives around the same time as the European Commission claims Meta will offer users in the European Union more options about how their data is being used for personalized ads. Instagram's current approach, where users can pay a subscription to not see ads, does not meet the standards for choice set up under the Digital Markets act, according to the EU. Users in this locale are expected to see a choice soon whether to share all their data, or opt for a smaller sliver to be used for advertising purposes.

Instagram is currently ahead of TikTok in overall social media app adoption among young users, but TikTok isn't that far off. According to a 2025 study by the Pew Research Center, 80 percent of US adults under 30 used Instagram whereas 63 percent used TikTok.

When a user opens the new “Your Algorithm” tab on Instagram, they'll see a brief summary of what they've “been into” while scrolling through Reels. The topics displayed are based on recent user activity, and the summaries are made using generative AI. Meta's examples of topics that users could add with the new feature include “Horror movies,” “Chess,” and “College football.”

For the bold, Instagram is including a way to post this summary of what you've been watching and topics you've adjusted. Because, what's the fun in having your data tracked and personalized if you can't share it with the world? No need to wait for me to post mine on some Close Friends story, my top interests on Reels right now are: a stand-up set Gianmarco Soresi did at a furry convention and decadent grilled cheese sandwiches—so damn gooey.

Throughout 2025, Instagram has launched new features designed around the personalization of algorithmic feeds and other tools aimed at capturing a young audience. The “Friends” tab in Reels dropped this year for users who want to creep on what videos their friends are liking and commenting on. And while it could be considered an invasion of privacy, always-on location sharing is trendy among Gen Z friends, so Instagram also added an opt-in version of that feature that allows people to pinpoint on the app's map exactly where their friends are.

Instagram's “Your Algorithm” feature shares some similarities to the “Manage Topics” tool TikTok launched last year in the US. Rather than highlighting what personally may be most interesting to you, this TikTok feature lists a bunch of general interest topics, like “Current Affairs” and “Travel,” with adjustable sliders to request more or less of those things in your video feed. While TikTok launched this first, Meta's new options provide more granular controls.

As social media companies have prioritized mega-viral hits and other crowd pleasing videos in their algorithmic feeds over the past few years, many users have complained about not being able to see the more niche videos they want. It's akin to being dragged around like a piece of driftwood, ripping carelessly through the river rapids of short-form online content. The battle for algorithm-less, chronological feeds may have been lost by users, but the social media companies' battle to come up with more engaging hyper-personalized features rages on.

Amy Lindberg spent 26 years in the Navy and she still walked like it—with intention, like her chin had someplace to be. But around 2017, her right foot stopped following orders. Lindberg and her husband Brad were five years into their retirement. After moving 10 times for Uncle Sam, they'd bought their dream house near the North Carolina coast. They had a backyard that spilled out onto wetlands. From the kitchen, you could see cranes hunting. They kept bees and played pickleball and watched their children grow.

Amy Lindberg kneels near a beehive in her North Carolina backyard in late November.

Lindberg checks on her bees.

But now Lindberg's right foot was out of rhythm. She worked hard to ignore it, but she couldn't disregard the tremors. And she'd started to misplace words and thoughts, especially when she got excited. Was this normal? She was 57, fit and clean-living. Could the culprit be menopause?

The diagnosis took all of five minutes. Lindberg had Parkinson's disease, the neurologist said, with all the classic symptoms. PD—as the scientists she would meet call it—is a neurological disorder, and a life sentence. Sufferers gradually lose control of their muscles, their bowels, their esophagus. Doctors told Lindberg that there was no way to know what had caused it.

Lindberg spent years in the military, around Camp Lejeune.

The daughter of a sailor, Lindberg had built her life around the military. She was commissioned in the Navy out of college and became an officer at 23. Her first posting was to Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, a city-sized training hub that supports more than 60,000 sailors and marines. There were murmurs even then—whispers of weird cancers and stillbirths—but Lejeune was one of the prettier pieces of land in the Navy's property portfolio. The bachelor officers' quarters were on a grassy thumb of shoreline called Paradise Point, where the New River meets the Atlantic.

“Lejeune was just picturesque,” Lindberg says. “We had a river right there, and the beach wasn't far away, and you worked half a mile from where you lived.” She loved her job at the hospital and made lifelong friends. She met her husband—a photo on her desk shows a blond Lindberg beaming beneath her Navy cap while Brad smiles broadly in his dress blues. “It was really nice,” she says. “You'd never suspect the water.”

Parkinson's is the second most common neurological disease in the United States, after Alzheimer's; each year 90,000 Americans are diagnosed. For decades, Parkinson's research has focused on genetics, on finding the rogue letters in our genome that cause this incurable misery. Today, published research on the genetics behind Parkinson's outnumbers all other potential causes six to one. This is partially because one of the disease's most generous benefactors, Google cofounder Sergey Brin, can tie Parkinson's to his genetics. Some Parkinson's patients diagnosed before age 50—as Michael J. Fox was—can trace the disease to their genes; Brin, whose mother has the disease, carries a mutation of the LRRK2 gene, which significantly increases the likelihood of him developing PD. Over the years, Fox's foundation has raised billions for Parkinson's research, and Brin has personally committed $1.8 billion to fighting the disorder. All told, more than half of Parkinson's research dollars in the past two decades have flowed toward genetics.

But Parkinson's rates in the US have doubled in the past 30 years. And studies suggest they will climb another 15 to 35 percent in each coming decade. This is not how an inherited genetic disease is supposed to behave.

Despite the avalanche of funding, the latest research suggests that only 10 to 15 percent of Parkinson's cases can be fully explained by genetics. The other three-quarters are, functionally, a mystery. “More than two-thirds of people with PD don't have any clear genetic link,” says Briana De Miranda, a researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “So, we're moving to a new question: What else could it be?”

“The health you enjoy or don't enjoy today is a function of your environment in the past,” says Ray Dorsey, a physician and professor of neurology at the University of Rochester. Your “environment” could be the refinery a town over, the lead in the paint of your mother's home, the plastic sheath of the Hot Pocket you microwaved in 1996. It is air pollution and PFAS and pesticides and so much more.

And this environment of yours—the sum of all your exposures, from conception to the grave—could be making you sicker than you realize. In a study of half a million Britons, Oxford researchers determined that lifestyle and the environment is 10 times more likely to explain early death than genetics. But that also offers a tantalizing prospect. If Parkinson's is an environmental disease, as Dorsey and a small band of researchers emphatically believe, then maybe we can end it.

In 1982, two years before Lindberg was stationed at Camp Lejeune, a 42-year-old heroin addict named George Carillo was wheeled into the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose, California. A few days earlier, Carillo had been perfectly able-bodied. Now he was mute and unable to move. Baffled, the neurologists on call came to an impossible diagnosis: The patient, over a long weekend, had developed Parkinson's disease.

Carillo would probably have spent the rest of his short life in a psych ward had a pioneering young neurologist named Bill Langston not intervened. The way Parkinson's takes over the body is distinct, Langston told me. The disease attacks the neurons in a region of the brain called the substantia nigra, a small dark structure that stands out amid the squirms of beige. The neurons here release dopamine, which sends signals to other neurons that help the body to move smoothly and effectively. In Parkinson's these neurons die off; by the time a patient is diagnosed, they have often lost 60 to 80 percent of them. The process usually takes years, Langston says. But in the case of Carillo, all the neurons had disappeared almost overnight.

Genetics became the “800-pound gorilla,” as one scientist put it. “All the research dollars went toward genetics.”

Over the summer of 1982, Langston found five more “frozen addicts” across the Bay Area. Through gumshoe detective work, he discovered they had all injected a batch of what they believed to be a designer drug called MPPP, cooked in a Morgan Hill basement. But the chemistry had gone awry. Instead of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-4-propionoxypiperidine, a potent opioid with morphine-like effects, the dime-bag chemist had accidentally made 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, or MPTP, a pharmacological slipup that would rewrite neurology textbooks.

When Langston and colleagues secured a batch of MPTP and tested it on primates, they knew they had uncorked a revolution. “Any neurologist could see these monkeys and immediately know that's Parkinson's,” Langston says—which was especially compelling, since monkeys do not get Parkinson's in the wild. In a first, Langston showed that MPTP killed the dopamine-producing neurons in monkeys' substantia nigra. The discovery made him the most famous Parkinson's researcher in the country and, Langston wrote at the time, promised to “turn the entire field of Parkinson's disease upside down.” Parkinson's, it appeared, could be caused by a chemical.

Amy Lindberg settled quickly into life at Lejeune. She played tennis and ran on her lunch breaks, flitting through sprinklers in the turgid Carolina summers. But something dark was lurking beneath her feet.

Sometime before 1953, a massive plume of trichlorethylene, or TCE, had entered the groundwater beneath Camp Lejeune. TCE is a highly effective solvent—one of those midcentury wonder chemicals—that vaporizes quickly and dissolves whatever grease it touches. The spill's source is debated, but grunts on base used TCE to maintain machinery, and the dry cleaner sprayed it on dress blues. It was ubiquitous at Lejeune and all over America.

And TCE appeared benign, too—you could rub it on your hands or huff its fumes and feel no immediate effects. It plays a longer game. For approximately 35 years, Marines and sailors who lived at Lejeune unknowingly breathed in vaporized TCE whenever they turned on their tap. The Navy, which oversees the Marine Corps, first denied the toxic plume's existence, then refused to admit it could affect Marines' health. But as Lejeune's vets aged, cancers and unexplained illness began stalking them at staggering rates. Marines stationed on base had a 35 percent higher risk of developing kidney cancer, a 47 percent higher risk of Hodgkin's lymphoma, a 68 percent higher risk of multiple myeloma. At the local cemetery, the section reserved for infants had to be expanded.

Meanwhile, Langston had spent the remainder of the 1980s setting up the California Parkinson's Foundation (later renamed the Parkinson's Institute), a lab and treatment facility equipped with everything needed to finally reveal the cause of the disease. “We thought we were going to solve it,” Langston told me. Researchers affiliated with the institute created the first animal model for Parkinson's, identified a pesticide called Paraquat as a near chemical match to MPTP, and proved that farm workers who sprayed Paraquat developed Parkinson's at exceedingly high rates. Then they showed that identical twins developed Parkinson's at the same rate as fraternal twins—something that wouldn't make sense if the disease were purely genetic, since identical twins share DNA and fraternal twins do not. They even noted TCE as a potential cause of the disease, Langston says. Each revelation, the team thought, represented another nail in the coffin of the genetic theory of Parkinson's.

When Goldman compared both populations, the results were shocking: Marines exposed to TCE at Lejeune were 70 percent more likely to have Parkinson's than those stationed at Pendleton.

But there was a problem. The Human Genome Project had launched in 1990, promising to usher in a new era of personalized medicine. The project's goal, to identify all of the genes in man, was radical, and by the time it was completed in 2000, frothy comparisons to the moon landing were frequent. Unraveling our genome would “revolutionize the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of most, if not all, human diseases,” then president Bill Clinton said.

But for Langston and his colleagues, the Human Genome Project sucked the air out of the environmental health space. Genetics became the “800-pound gorilla,” as one scientist put it. “All the research dollars went toward genetics,” says Sam Goldman, who worked with Langston on the twin study. “It's just a lot sexier than epidemiology. It's the latest gadget, the bigger rocket.” A generation of young scientists were being trained to think of genetics and genomics as the default place to look for answers. “I characterize science as a bunch of 5-year-olds playing soccer,” says another researcher. “They all go where the ball is, running around the field in a herd.” And the ball was decidedly not environmental health. “Donors want a cure,” Langston says. “And they want it now.”

In 1997, researchers found a family in Italy that had passed along Parkinson's disease for generations. Although the gene in question would later be shown to cause just a fraction of Parkinson's cases, the damage was done. The Parkinson's Institute faced stronger economic headwinds and difficulties with administration, and Langston eventually chose to shut it down. The environmental theory of Parkinson's went back on the shelf.

No one knows exactly how much of the world's drinking water is laced with TCE. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reckons that the water supply of between 4 and 18 percent of Americans is contaminated, although not always at dangerous concentrations; the Environmental Working Group figures 17 million Americans drink the stuff. In Silicon Valley, where TCE was integral to the manufacturing of early transistors, a necklace of underground plumes have been identified along Highway 101 from Palo Alto to San Jose. Santa Clara County has more toxic Superfund sites, at 23, than any other county in the country. (Several tech giants have offices near or on top of these sites; in 2013, workers at a Google office were subjected to unhealthy levels of TCE for months after a ventilation system failed.)

And while TCE's connection to cancer is well studied, what it does to our brain is more mysterious. That's because good data on exposure is devilishly hard to come by. The US, with its fractious health care system, has few national databases, and chemical exposures are rarely tracked.

Sam Goldman at his home in San Francisco. His research compared Camp Pendleton in California with Lejeune.

In 2017, Sam Goldman realized that Camp Lejeune offered the perfect opportunity to change this. Goldman—an epidemiologist and a doctor—has made a career out of teasing apart data: finding unusual case reports, looking for patterns, interviewing patients in the clinic about what chemicals they handled at old jobs and what exposures they faced in their childhood. In the case of Lejeune, Goldman could examine VA medical records to find Parkinson's diagnoses and compare them to service records. But Goldman's genius wasn't finding this Lejeune cohort—it was realizing he had a control group, too.

Camp Pendleton, in Southern California, is the Marine Corps' West Coast equivalent to Lejeune. Thousands of young, healthy Marines shuffle through its barbed-wired gates each year. But Pendleton has one thing Lejeune does not: uncontaminated drinking water.

When Goldman compared both populations, the results were shocking: Marines exposed to TCE at Lejeune were 70 percent more likely to have Parkinson's than those stationed at Pendleton. And in a follow-up study last year, he showed that disease progression in Lejeune vets with the highest exposure to TCE was faster than those with low or no exposure, too. In the world of Parkinson's research, Goldman's study was a blockbuster.

But to really prove a link, you need more than just correlation. So, on the third floor of a drab university building in Birmingham, Alabama, Briana De Miranda has re-created Camp Lejeune in her lab, but for mice.

University of Alabama at Birmingham, a research center.

De Miranda is a toxicologist, not a neurologist, which is an unusual CV for a cutting-edge Parkinson's researcher. When I visit her in October 2024, she shows me the plexiglass chamber where a few dozen mice doze in a pile. They've been spending their days in this chamber for months, inhaling a small amount of TCE almost every day. This experiment is the first to re-create the exposure someone like Lindberg experienced over years at Camp Lejeune.

De Miranda walks into a dark annex of her lab and asks a tech to pull up some imagery. “These are dopamine neurons in the brain,” De Miranda says, pointing to a scan of the control mice. In unexposed mice the substantia nigra looks like a nighttime satellite image of Manhattan—thousands of neurons sending dopamine across the mice's brains to orchestrate fluid scurrying and sniffing and munching. Then the tech pulls up the brain scans of mice who have been exposed to TCE. Suddenly we're in West Virginia. It's not pitch black, but most of the lights are off and the ones that remain have been dimmed. The dopamine neurons have died, De Miranda explains. And she's seeing the physical effects in the mice too. “We see minor motion defects; we see it in their gait, and we are seeing cognitive effects,” De Miranda says.

De Miranda's studies, the first ever on inhaled TCE toxicity and Parkinson's, are compelling, her colleagues agree, and well designed. And although there is more work to be done, the results wrap a bow on Goldman's epidemiological work and the Parkinson's Institute's years of research. TCE is a neurotoxin, and generations of Americans have been exposed. In December 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency finally moved to ban TCE in the United States.

There is a sense of empowerment in knowing that our health is not predetermined.

“I think TCE is the most important cause of Parkinson's in the US,” says Ray Dorsey, the Parkinson's expert at the University of Rochester. In 2021, Dorsey, who frequently collaborates with De Miranda, Goldman, and a core group of like-minded scientists, published Ending Parkinson's Disease. The book's central thesis: Parkinson's is a growing pandemic, and up to 90 percent of cases are caused by chemicals in our environment. Cut exposures like TCE and pesticides, and we can “end Parkinson's” as we know it. “The full effect of the Parkinson's pandemic,” Dorsey writes, “is not inevitable but, to a large extent, preventable.”

Since the 1990s, the number of Americans with chronic disease has ballooned to more than 75 percent of adults, per the CDC. Autism, insulin resistance, and autoimmune diagnoses have reached epidemic proportions. The incidence of cancer in people under the age of 50 has hit an all-time high. If Parkinson's disease is—as Ray Dorsey believes—a pandemic that's being caused by our environment, it's probably not the only one.

After a century of putting genetics on a pedestal, the geneticists have some surprising news for us: The vast majority of chronic disease isn't caused by our genes. “The Human Genome Project was a $3 billion investment, and what did we find out?” says Thomas Hartung, a toxicologist at Johns Hopkins. “Five percent of all disease is purely genetic. Less than 40 percent of diseases even have a genetic component.”

Most of the conditions we worry about, instead, stem from a complex interaction between our genes and our environment. Genetics loads the gun, as former National Institutes of Health head Francis Collins put it, but the environment pulls the trigger. Rather than revealing the genetic origins of disease, genomics has done the opposite. Only 10 percent of breast cancer cases are purely genetic. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? Rheumatoid arthritis? Coronary heart disease? All hover around 20 percent. The primary driver of disease is considerably more terrestrial: It's the environment, stupid.

Yet only 1 percent of the roughly 350,000 chemicals in use in the United States have ever been tested for safety. In its 55-year history, the EPA has banned or restricted about a dozen (by contrast, the EU has banned more than 2,000). Paraquat, the pesticide that appears to cause Parkinson's in farmworkers, has been banned in Europe and China but remains available in the US. And in January, a month after the EPA's ban on TCE was finalized, the Trump administration moved to undo it, even as new evidence emerged of Parkinson's clusters in the rust belt, where exposure to trichloroethylene is high.

It's easy to mock the MAHAs and the TikTok trad moms making their own food coloring, but the chemical regulatory system in America does not inspire confidence. No one really knows what the chemicals we're interacting with every day are doing to our bodies.

The New River laps at a rocky shore in North Carolina. According to Coastal Carolina Riverwatch, the New River has been plagued with some form of solid waste pollution and agricultural runoff for nearly four decades.

That's why, earlier this year, slices of brain from Briana De Miranda's TCE-addled mice ended up with Gary Miller, a professor at Columbia University. Miller is the country's leading proponent of a brand-new field called exposomics. Your “exposome” is the sum of your own personal environmental exposures, from the womb to the casket. Many exposures, like TCE, disappear from the bloodstream quickly; people who came into contact with a chemical in the past will never be able to prove it. The exposome is a way to potentially answer the question, “Just what the hell have I been exposed to?”

Miller began his career in the '90s as a Parkinson's researcher studying environmental exposures. But he grew tired of the “whack-a-mole approach” of modern toxicology: identifying one of the 350,000 chemicals on the market as a potential toxicant, looking for the exposure in the environment, looking for correlations, looking for toxicity in mice's brains, rinse, repeat.

He wanted a shotgun approach, an answer to the way genome sequencing identifies all the genes in the body. What Miller wants is a Human Exposome Project. “We realized that this wasn't just about Parkinson's,” he says. “There were so many disease states we could look at.” Quantify our exposomes, Miller hopes, and we can know what ails us.

“We have the tools to put the big puzzle together,” says Rima Habre, an environmental health and exposomics expert at the University of Southern California. Through blood draws and metabolomic studies, the exposomics advocates want to measure the vast mixture of chemicals and pollutants in the body and figure out how they impact health. Take air pollution, Habre's specialty. An ever-changing mélange of small molecules, from tailpipe emissions to tire bits to dust, it has been linked to obesity, endocrine disruption, heart attacks, and more. But if we can figure out what specifically in this toxic cloud is doing the damage, Habre says, we can work to quickly reduce it in our environment, the way we removed lead from gasoline.

Or autism. Autism diagnoses have exploded from 1 in 10,000 in the '70s to 1 in 36 today, a rate that genetics and screening can't explain, says Johns Hopkins' Thomas Hartung. Hartung, another Human Exposome Project proponent, is growing clusters of neurons in the lab and subjecting them to flame-retardant chemicals—which are applied to couches and car seats across America—to see what happens. Already, the associations trouble him. The goal of all this, Hartung says, is a world where toxicologists like Briana De Miranda don't have to spend money creating a mouse gas chamber, expose mice for three months, then wait several more months for results.

Miller's goal with mice brains is to figure out what exactly about TCE is killing dopamine-producing neurons and leading to Parkinson's—to unravel and define the interaction between our environment and our genetics in a way never before possible.

The parallels to the Human Genome Project—in both promise and froth—are clear. But there is a sense of empowerment in knowing that our health is not predetermined. Nearly every scientist interviewed for this story does a few simple things. They filter their water, they run an air purifier, they don't microwave plastic. They don't freak out about their daily exposures, but they do things like opt for fragrance-free products, avoid eating out of plastic when they can, and buy organic produce. Our exposures, while not always in our control, can be limited.

About two hours south of Lejeune in Wilmington, North Carolina, Amy Lindberg is having lunch with her husband, Brad, on a pier overlooking the Atlantic. Although Goldman, De Miranda, and Dorsey have unveiled the likely origins of her Parkinson's, the random nature of it gnaws at her. “When I was diagnosed, it was just like, where's everyone else?” Lindberg says. “I felt like, if I have it, what about my coworkers?” She nods to Brad, who also spent years drinking Lejeune's water. “He suffered no ill consequences,” she says. She worries about her kids, one of whom was born on base.

Participants train during a Rock Steady Boxing class in Wilmington, North Carolina.

Amy Lindberg trains at Rock Steady Boxing class in late November.

She still exercises constantly, playing pickleball, boxing, and hopping on the elliptical. She's found that movement, especially high-intensity exercise, reduces her symptoms. A recent Yale study confirmed as much, showing that interval training increases dopaminergic signals in the brains of Parkinson's patients, suggesting that exercise slows disease progression and even improves neuron function. The environment may have caused Lindberg's disease, but she can use it to fight back too.

Amazon has been expanding its e-reader lineup over the past year to feature a panoply of color-screen options, and as of today, those options include a Kindle Scribe, Amazon's e-reader that adds digital notebook capabilities and a larger screen to make writing and drawing easier. The new Kindle Scribe Colorsoft arrives with a hefty price tag and bigger screen than the past iteration, and it doesn't arrive alone: a new third-generation regular Kindle Scribe will arrive with it, featuring a matching design but no color screen.

While I like both devices' new home screen and taller, slimmer design, I'm not sure they're worth investing in unless you're desperate for a color Kindle that doubles as a digital notebook. They're good devices overall, but in a saturated space of color-screen e-readers and digital notebooks with better price tags (or more features for a similar price), these new Kindle Scribes aren't necessarily a must-buy.

While I'm not surprised to see the arrival of a color-screen version of the Kindle Scribe, I am surprised we're already getting a new base Scribe after a new one arrived just last year. This is the third generation of this device, with the original launching back in the fall of 2022. Amazon says it's “always innovating and looking to bring those innovations to customers as quickly as possible,"" but it still feels like a fast move to replace it so soon.

Rating: 7/10

There are plenty of changes to be seen when comparing these new Scribe models to the old ones, but aside from the color screen, the Kindle Scribe (3rd Gen) and Kindle Scribe Colorsoft are otherwise identical to each other. Both have the new 11-inch screen, with the taller and slimmer form factor that trims off the second-generation model's thick, one-sided bezel that functioned as a handle. Instead, both new Scribes feature a uniform bezel around the entire screen, and the power button has been moved to the upper right-hand side. Both also have great battery life, though it's worth noting that while the new Scribe maintains the previous version's 12 weeks of battery life for reading, the Scribe Colorsoft has a shorter, eight-week battery life for reading. Both promise up to three weeks of battery life for writing.

There's a new homepage design I really like, which does well to highlight all the best features of the Scribe. There's a premade notebook accessible at the top, called Quick Notes, though you can't write straight onto it, even though it looks that way. Instead, you can tap on it and instantly enter that notebook, and it also provides a visual of what you last wrote. I like using it for the day's to-do list. Then there's a “Jump Back In” section on the right that has your last five things you opened, whether that was an ebook or a digital notebook. Below that, you have rows of books like you'd see on other Kindles, for what's in your library and what else you might want to read. It's a handy starting point, and I like that I can easily access notebooks and books that I've recently used without needing to open different tabs.

Speaking of tabs, the Notebooks tab has been renamed to Workspace—you can sync it with Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive to access your PDFs to mark them up, and you can export the annotated versions. It's a nice feature in theory, but I don't think it's that useful since you can't actually edit the document itself. If you wanted it to reflect, say, edits you need to make on a paper, you'd have to export your marked-up version and then edit your Google Doc separately. It's a fun option if you're strictly an editor, but as a writer, it feels too limited to be super useful.

The new Kindle Scribe stylus

Rating: 7/10

Both Scribe models come with a stylus, which also has a new look. While the devices are taller and thinner, the stylus is shorter, thicker, and feels a little heavier. There's still a little shortcut button that defaults to highlighter mode (though you can edit it to be something else) and an eraser on the back, but I preferred the lighter feel of the old stylus. The writing feel is nice and smooth with a touch of resistance, though I wouldn't call it as realistic as other digital notebooks I've tried. I don't count that against it, either; I like the smooth feel, and it makes it easy to write in loopy cursive or sketch.

Kindle Scribe Colorsoft

Of the two Kindles that arrived today, I will admit the Scribe Colorsoft is the more exciting release. It's Kindle's first colorful take on a digital notebook (and the fourth edition to its e-reader collection of Colorsofts), allowing Kindle to finally compete against the colorful options of our favorite digital notebooks from the likes of Kobo and reMarkable.

Like the Colorsoft and other similar colorful e-readers, the Scribe Colorsoft has 150 ppi (pixels per inch) of color, and 300 ppi for black-and-white. It has a new quad-core chip that promises to support both the color screen and various AI features that the Scribe has or will have soon (more on that below). You'll get 10 colors for your pens, including black and gray, and five highlight colors. You're able to use those colors both on the Workspace tab and on your ebooks, allowing you to highlight and underline in any color you choose.

You'll also get a new tool for drawing. You'll get the pen styles that we saw in the previous generation (pen, fountain, marker, and pencil), but now there's a new shader tool that lets you layer light shades of color on top of each other for a more detailed, almost watercolor-like look. I'm not sure this is a tool I'll use often—I wouldn't call the Scribe Colorsoft a true drawing tablet, and would still prefer to draw with Procreate on my old iPad if I were going to work on digital art, but it's a nice feature to have.

The Summarize tool in action

Both new Kindle Scribes have larger storage capacity (there's no 16-GB option anymore, just 32 GB and 64 GB) and a new quad-core chip that promises to support the various AI-powered features on the Scribe, including things like summarizing your notebook page or refining your writing, both of which you can do on the older Scribe. Newer AI-powered features like Story So Far, which summarizes books you're reading up until the point you've read, and Ask This Book, which lets you ask spoiler-free questions about books you're reading, won't be available until next year.

Rating: 7/10

The usual problem with AI persists in that it can't promise accuracy. I tried summarizing a page about my workout schedule on the new Scribe Colorsoft, but the AI managed to remove one of my day's plans and had mixed results translating words like “lift” and “hoop” thanks to my cursive-like handwriting. As someone who writes a lot of notes, I usually don't find myself reaching for these summary tools. Maybe they're of interest to you, but to me, they're just bloat. I'm looking forward to seeing the summarization tools, but I'm hesitant to trust them.

Expanded margins, sticky notes, and Active Canvas features

What's not different is my primary complaint about the Kindle Scribe compared to other e-readers that have digital notebook capabilities: You can't write in the margins or directly on the pages. Instead, the Active Canvas feature, which allows for notes around but not on the text, is still the only way to write notes in your ebook of choice. It was something we didn't love about the previous model (8/10, WIRED Recommends), and I'm sad to see that the new edition didn't fix it. I'd personally rather see that ability than all these AI features. You can also add a sticky note or use the expanded margins feature, but it's not the same as how fun it is to write right on the page of my Kobo e-reader. Maybe the fourth generation will fix that for us.

Ultimately, if you already have the second-generation Scribe, I don't think you need to upgrade. The older Scribe will also get the new homepage added to it in 2026. It also bears mentioning that at this price point, you might as well upgrade to a reMarkable tablet, which has more capabilities and accessories to transform it into an e-paper laptop of sorts. What was once a great deal for an e-reader and limited digital notebook is now a pretty big investment for a still-limited device when compared with the competition. I'm sure the pared-down Scribe due next year (without the front light) will bring the price down, but having no front light is a pretty irritating cost if you're someone who uses their device at night or in a darkened classroom or airplane. Neither of the new Kindle Scribes is a bad device, but if you're looking for a great e-reader that doubles as a digital notebook, neither of them would be my go-to pick.

5/10

When Logitech signaled the end of the universal remote era by announcing the death of its Harmony product line in April 2021, I was sad to see it go. Though it had dominated the universal remote market for most of the preceding 20 years, Logitech's Harmony had become a relic. As streaming eclipsed physical media, as affordable smart TVs with built-in apps proliferated, and as HDMI-CEC became a ubiquitous way for devices to talk to each other, the need for a programmable, universal infrared remote gradually dissipated. Even the addition of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to Harmony's control toolbox couldn't save it from rapidly declining sales.

Still, many folks have held on to their legacy IR devices and have added newer, Bluetooth, and networked gadgets to their smart homes. For them, a true, whole-home remote that doesn't cost a fortune or require a professional integrator would be enthusiastically welcomed.

That's the elevator pitch for the Cantata Haptique RS90 universal remote (€349/$406): Based on an Android platform, the RS90 promises to do everything a top-of-the-line Harmony could do, plus far more, including voice commands—a feature Logitech never successfully implemented.

In theory, the RS90 should be the last remote you'll ever need. In reality, it's a beautiful piece of hardware that has a long way to go if it ever wishes to assume the universal remote throne that Logitech abandoned.

Even though my own Harmony Elite had been gathering dust for more than a year, my inner geek celebrated the arrival of a new generation of universal remotes.

It doesn't hurt that the Haptique RS90 is very easy on the eyes. It eschews the usual button-festooned glossy plastic baton in favor of a sleek, angled aluminum chassis. The bottom portion sports a simple (and backlit) 24-button keypad, while the top features a 3.1-inch color touchscreen and an IR emitter. It looks like Bang & Olufsen's ahead-of-its-time 1991 Beolink 7000 remote, but reimagined for today's devices.

Under the hood, the RS90 packs smartphone levels of computational firepower: an ARM Octacore processor with 3 GB of RAM, 16 GB of storage, and both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. It has a built-in mic and speaker and comes with a charging cradle to keep its internal battery topped up when not in use. A custom version of Android 12 runs the whole show, with Cantata's software as the default experience. Canata plans to release a fancier version known as the RS90x that uses an OLED screen, has more internal storage, and possesses a fingerprint reader and, crucially, an IR receiver (something the RS90 notably lacks).

What made Logitech's formula so successful was three key ingredients: a massive 7,000-brand device database, a straightforward user interface both in the app as well as on the remote, and a one-button help function that walked you through the steps needed when things didn't go as planned.

The Haptique RS90 struggles in all three areas. According to the company's online database, it supports more than 6,200 brands. Once you're in the Haptique Config app, it can be a different story. As an example, the website lists 262 projector brands; the app says it only supports 26.

The RS90 follows the same tried-and-true formula that Logitech established with the Harmony. A smartphone app lets you set up rooms, devices, and sequences. Devices are added to their respective rooms (presumably to make it easier to find them later), and sequences like “Watch TV” or “Bedtime” trigger device functions automatically. Watch TV, for instance, might turn on your TV, set the input to HDMI 1, turn on your Apple TV, and trigger the Netflix app to open. Harmony fans will recognize this—it's the same idea as Activities. Once you've entered all this info, the RS90 can retrieve it from the app, giving you access to these elements via its touchscreen.

The Haptique Config app is actually quite well designed. Once you set up your account (a mandatory process) and associate your RS90 with the app, you're greeted with a dashboard that shows your remote (or remotes if you own more than one Haptique), your devices, sequences, and rooms.

Adding devices is easy, as long as you already know which category they belong to. It's not as straightforward as it sounds. For instance, depending on the model, an Apple TV can be controlled by IR, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi (or all three). Since there's no global device search, you must decide which one to use. If you choose IR, you'll have to decide if an Apple TV is a Set Top Box, a Media Box, or a Media Player. Spoiler: You'll find it in the second and third categories, but not the first.

My Nvidia Shield, which I think of as a media player, is categorized as a Smart TV. On the other hand, my LG C7 OLED, which is genuinely a Smart TV, couldn't be found in the Smart TV device section, so I had to add it as an IR device instead. Still, after about an hour of messing around, I was able to add several of my most-used devices.

Some brands get dedicated integrations for deeper control and easier device detection. Sonos gets its own category, as does Roku, Philips Hue, BluOS, and Denon.

The sequences I created were hardly complex—they're all variations on the Watch TV idea, since I don't own any smart home devices like lightbulbs or blinds. They were easy to create, but unlike the Harmony, you can't test them before you sync them to the remote.

There's also no way to edit sequences (except to change the order of steps or the delay between them). The most frustrating omission, however, is the lack of a help feature when a sequence fails, which happened to me several times. Cantata says it's working on this, but hasn't said when it will be added.

Once you start working with the RS90, things become more confusing. Instead of the simple Devices/Rooms/Sequences organization from the Haptique app, the remote uses Groups/Macros/Rooms as the three primary home screens. Rooms is easy—it's the collection of rooms you create in the app. Macros is where you'll find sequences you've created, but only the ones you've flagged as favorites. Groups, I think, is meant for devices—it uses the same icon as Devices in the app—but there are no devices here, and there's no way to favorite them. Instead, to see your devices (or your non-favorite sequences), they must be added to Rooms.

Navigation on the remote is bewildering. Some buttons, like the rooms, require a single tap. Others, like devices and sequences, need a long-press. You can use the D-pad to move around the interface, but once you're into a device-specific screen, the D-pad and other buttons like Home become mapped to that device. To go back to the home screens, you need to long-press on the back button.

Some features, like managing a Sonos system, require a combination of the touchscreen and the keypad, but it's trial and error. The main Sonos playback screen needs you to tap icons, like the one that brings up your list of Sonos devices. But the list itself can only be scrolled using the up/down keys, and the same goes for actually selecting a Sonos speaker for playback. That's if you can actually select your desired speaker. My list of devices was too long and prevented the crucial “apply” button from being visible.

I had hoped to use the built-in mic for Siri commands on the Apple TV, but this isn't supported. Cantata tells me it only works with Samsung and LG TVs at the moment. The volume controls are also incompatible with the Apple TV. Oh, and because the RS90 is an Android-driven platform, there will be times when you have to enter those Android system menus to make changes that aren't configurable from the app.

All of this complexity could be partially mitigated by a well-laid-out quick start guide or a first-time user walkthrough in the app, but Canata's documentation is as erratic as the RS90. The QR code that greets you when you open the box leads to a PDF that hasn't been updated in a while—many of the included screenshots don't match the current version of the app. It's also inaccurate: on one page it claims that “The microphone button works for services like Siri for Apple TV, Alexa, and Amazon Fire TV,” (it doesn't, at least, not yet).

You'll probably be better off referring to the full online manual, but even that uses out-of-date screen captures and can be frustratingly vague—I have yet to successfully add a Bluetooth device based on its guidance. In my final week with the RS90, Cantata started to release YouTube tutorials, but even these will prove difficult for non-techies. They present steps and processes in a rapid-fire manner, forcing newbies to pause often or repeat sections.

The Haptique RS90 is a beautiful device, with an impeccable build quality. It possesses an abundance of computational power and wireless protocols. Thanks to its Android underpinnings, it absolutely has the potential to control every device you own and the many more that will follow. But right now, it's a universal remote that only the most dedicated techie will love.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","Australia Bans Social Media Accounts for Minors","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/australia-bans-social-media-accounts-for-minors-180052.html","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 13:01:26 GMT","

A new law took effect in Australia on Tuesday that bans anyone under 16 from having a social media account on platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat, X (formerly Twitter), Twitch, Reddit, and Threads.

Platforms that violate the law face fines of up to AU$49.5 million, or about US$33 million.

All listed platforms, except X, had confirmed by Tuesday they would comply with the ban, according to a report in The Guardian. The owner and executive chairman of X, Elon Musk, called the law in a tweet “a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.”

Update Dec. 10, 2025: In a statement provided to TechNewsWorld by spokesperson Joanna Stevens, Meta said it has removed access to Instagram, Threads and Facebook for teens who it understands to be under 16, and will prevent new users under 16 from creating accounts.”Ongoing compliance with the law will be a multi-layered process that we will continue to refine,” it explained.

“While we're committed to meeting our legal obligations, we're already seeing some of the concerns come to light previously raised by experts, youth groups, and many parents who believe that blanket bans are not the solution,” it continued. “These include isolating vulnerable teens from getting support from online communities, driving teens to less regulated apps and parts of the internet, inconsistent age verification methods, and little interest in compliance from many teens and parents. This will result in inconsistent application of the law and ultimately does not make young people safer.”

It advocated legislation that requires all the industry to invest in age-appropriate experiences, such as Meta's Teen Accounts, and standardized, privacy-preserving, and secure age verification at the app store level with age signals shared across the digital ecosystem.

Musk isn't alone in raising questions about the new law. Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst with the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a research and public policy organization, in Washington, D.C. acknowledged that it is necessary to protect children from harmful content online, but added “bans blocking an entire age group from social media is the equivalent of using a regulatory sledgehammer instead of a scalpel to address complex and evolving online safety issues.”

“Bans are likely to be highly impractical,” she told TechNewsWorld. “They will make accessing social media difficult for all users, not just children, as any platforms that utilize government ID-based age verification will require adults to turn over personal information.”

“Social media is a tool that is increasingly vital to social and political activism and everyday communication and expression,” she continued. “Many users would likely not want to give up their personal information to access social media, particularly platforms like X, Reddit, and many others that enable users to maintain anonymity.”

Australia took a very blunt approach to deal with this problem, maintained Jennifer Golbeck, a professor at the University of Maryland's College of Information Studies. “On one hand, we know social media can create harm for young people,” she told TechNewsWorld. “On the other [hand], there are also benefits, and the harm tends to manifest in specific ways.”

“It is important that we separate the real harms — like body image issues for teen girls — and the moral panic elements, such as kids spending too much time online and not engaging face to face,” she said.

“If we only wanted to address the harms, there are more surgical bans that could be instituted that limit the harm caused by algorithmic content feeds,” she continued. “If we are trying to address the moral panic, I think we end up with these blanket bans.”

“Besides,” she added, “Kids — and adults — are pretty adept at getting around bans like this. I would expect that a lot of minors will be able to get around it.”

Tony Anscombe, chief security evangelist at Eset, an information technology security company headquartered in Slovakia, agreed. “Those that want accounts will find ways to circumvent the bans, and those that can't circumvent it will find alternate, less regulated methods to share content and be online with others,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“This will cause an underground and unmonitored space that could potentially be more dangerous than spaces that are used today,” he said. “Regulation will never keep pace.”

A blanket ban feels more like a political gesture than a real solution, because kids will still find ways online through messaging apps, VPNs, and borrowed logins, maintained Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at SmartTech Research, a technology advisory firm in Las Vegas.

“The real problems are algorithm design, data harvesting, and weak safety controls, and none of those magically disappear at age 16,” he told TechNewsWorld. “If we are serious about harm, we should be regulating platform behavior and business models, not pretending an age line fixes everything.”

“On paper, bans sound simple,” he said, “but in practice, you are asking platforms to reliably verify the age of millions of teens who are extremely motivated to get around the rules.”

“That means either weak, easily gamed checks or intrusive age verification that creates new privacy and surveillance risks for everyone,” he continued. “So we end up with the worst of both worlds — kids still online, and a lot more sensitive identity data sloshing around.”

Although bans aim to protect kids, they can also harm them. “Youth will now be cut off from social interaction, connection to peers in similar circumstances, promotion and reinforcement of positive attitudes and behaviors, and support for members of marginalized groups,” the ITIF's Ambrose noted.

“While people are potentially harming themselves by overuse of social media, there are people who have never before had the chance to feel so accepted or to find support before the digital age allowed them to find people to connect with,” added Karen Kovacs North, a clinical professor of communication at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, at the University of Southern California.

“Anybody who feels marginalized or has an unusual passion can find supportive communities online that they could never find in their own daily life,” she told TechNewsWorld.

Critics of the ban also say it interferes with parental control over online activity. “Many parents will be averse to their children being banned,” asserted Yonatan S. Levoritz, founder of the Levoritz Law Firm, in New York City. “Parents do not want to be told what their children can or cannot do. They want to decide what is best for their own children and address their children's needs and desires.”

“Let us not forget that there is a lot of content that educates children on platforms, despite the rare attention seeker or TikTok challenge,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Overall, social media provides for growth, entertainment, and expansion of interests — from the arts to music to math to science.”

“A ban is akin to banning a library just because some content is controversial or inappropriate for children of certain ages,” he reasoned.

“Parents need to police their offspring's online activities,” added Chris Hauk, consumer privacy champion at Pixel Privacy, a publisher of online consumer security and privacy guides.

“To those parents who say they are simply too busy to keep an eye on their child, I say, ‘bull,'” he told TechNewsWorld. “There are many apps and services that can be used to monitor their child's activities, right down to their keystrokes.”

“Banning social media for minors puts an undue burden of proof on legitimate adult users and, in turn, has a chilling effect on freedom of speech,” added Paul Bischoff, consumer privacy advocate at Comparitech, a reviews, advice, and information website for consumer security products.

“Parents need to take responsibility and not depend on the government or tech giants to police their kids,” he told TechNewsWorld.

Australia's law is arguably the most aggressive because it doesn't allow a parental override, but other countries and states have already enacted similar laws, noted Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst with the Enderle Group, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore.

“Florida has a strict law that bans access under 14 and requires permission for those 14 and 15, and it took place in January of this year,” he told TechNewsWorld. “France requires parental permission for kids under 15, and that law went into effect back in 2023.”

He added that Utah passed a law in 2023 requiring anyone under 18 to have parental permission; China has laws that took effect in 2024 and 2025 that limit minors' access; and both the U.K. and Norway have laws in progress that are expected to take effect this year.

“I think there needs to be a broader reflection about the fact that social media is here to stay,” said Vincent Raynauld, an assistant professor in the Department of Communication Studies at Emerson College in Boston.

“You can prevent people from going on the platform, but they will eventually be using those platforms, whether it's for recreational, social, or professional purposes,” he told TechNewsWorld, “and I think that there needs to be recognition that training or at least education on use of social media and the effects of social media needs to take place.”

“Whether it's early on in elementary school or in high school,” he continued, “I think there needs to be some kind of training because social media is unavoidable these days.”

                                GeekWire Gala: Last chance to grab tickets

Bananas, blackberries, limes and more — Amazon's same-day delivery of perishable grocery items has expanded across the U.S. to more than 2,300 cities and towns, the company announced Wednesday.

Amazon launched the expanded offering earlier this year, allowing customers to integrate items such as fresh produce, seafood, milk and more into their regular shopping orders of electronics, books, clothes, and household essentials.

And customers have responded.

Fresh groceries now make up nine of the top 10 most-ordered same-day items, according to Amazon, with a 12-pack of toilet paper rounding out the bunch.

Analysts say Amazon's rapid expansion of same-day delivery for fresh groceries marks a meaningful escalation in its long-term push into perishable food — a category where it has historically lagged. 

The company's scale and logistics reach allow it to serve both small towns and large metro areas without relying on third-party platforms, according to Wedbush, which noted in a report Wednesday that the expansion ramps up competitive pressure on Instacart, whose business relies heavily on grocery delivery subscriptions.

Analysts also say the stronger grocery offering makes Amazon Prime's $139 annual membership more attractive, while weakening the value of Instacart+, which recently scaled back key subscriber benefits. Amazon is also increasingly competing with the grocery efforts of Uber Eats and DoorDash, according to Wedbush.

In most areas, the same-day deliveries are free for Amazon Prime members for orders that cost more than $25. If the purchase is below that amount, the cost is $2.99. For shoppers without a Prime membership, the delivery tacks on a $12.99 fee.

Since this summer, Amazon has expanded the fresh grocery selection available for same-day delivery by more than 30%, including offerings from Whole Foods Market and Amazon Grocery, the company's new private brand, which now includes over 1,000 items, with most priced under $5.

Amazon is also seeing a shift in shopping patterns as customers who add fresh groceries to their orders shop about twice as often as those who don't.

GeekWire tested the same-day service in June, placing a late-night order that arrived in the morning and included apples, cucumbers, and blueberries alongside non-perishable items.

Amazon says it plans to expand same-day perishable grocery delivery to more cities and towns in 2026.

The expansion of same-day perishable delivery comes as Amazon is also testing a new ultra-fast option called Amazon Now, which promises delivery in 30 minutes or less. GeekWire tested this service earlier this month, and received a frozen pizza, hummus, bread and more in 23 minutes, from order click to delivery drop-off in Seattle.

Amazon has for years been expanding and experimenting in the grocery space. In 2007, it started offering grocery deliveries in Seattle through Amazon Fresh, then offered Amazon Fresh grocery pick-up sites and eventually started opening Amazon Fresh grocery stores beginning in 2020. It acquired Whole Foods Market in 2017.

Microsoft has released one of its most detailed looks yet at how people use Copilot — and the results suggest the AI assistant plays different roles depending on time of day and the device.

In a new preprint titled “It's About Time: The Copilot Usage Report 2025,” Microsoft AI researchers analyzed 37.5 million de-identified Copilot conversations between January and September of this year. Enterprise and school accounts were excluded, and machine classifiers labeled each chat by topic and “intent,” such as searching for information, getting advice, or creating content.

The top-line finding: on desktop computers, Copilot usage centers on work and technical questions during business hours. On mobile, it's about health — all day, every day.

“Health and Fitness” paired with information-seeking was the single most common topic-intent combination for mobile users, and stayed in the top spot every hour of the day across the nine-month window. The paper suggests this shows how people increasingly treat Copilot on their phones as a private advisor for personal questions, not just a search tool. 

On PCs, “Work and Career” overtakes “Technology” as the top topic between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., mirroring a traditional office schedule. Other work-related topics such as science and education also rise during the day and fade overnight.

“The contrast between the desktop's professional utility and the mobile device's intimate consultation suggests that users are engaging with a single system in two ways: a colleague at their desk and a confidant in their pocket,” Microsoft wrote in the study.

Compared with January, the September data from Microsoft's study shows fewer programming conversations and more activity around culture and history — a sign, the researchers say, that usage has broadened beyond early technical adopters into more mainstream, non-developer use cases.

Usage reports from OpenAI and Anthropic found similar consumer patterns, with many people using ChatGPT and Claude for practical guidance, information, and writing help in their personal lives. Microsoft's new Copilot study adds a sharper twist: on desktops, AI looks like a co-worker; on phones, it looks a lot more like a health and life adviser.

In a companion blog post, Microsoft said the study shows how Copilot “is way more than a tool: it's a vital companion for life's big and small moments.”

The study highlights a rise in advice-seeking, particularly around personal topics. This suggests people are turning to AI not just to offload tasks but to help make decisions — which could raise the stakes for model builders around accuracy, trust and accountability.

Microsoft's research team included Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman as a co-author. Each conversation was automatically stripped of personally identifiable information and no human reviewers saw the underlying chats, according to the paper.

Strong software engineers who combine their foundational skills with fluency in rapidly emerging AI tools are more valuable than ever. And while AI boosts overall productivity by 34% on average, its widening the gap between top engineers and those considered weaker.

Those are among the findings from Karat, the Seattle-based technical talent evaluation startup, which released its new “AI Workforce Transformation” report on Wednesday, detailing how artificial intelligence tools are changing the way software is developed and what types of workers are most impacted by the technology.

The findings come from Karat's survey of 400 engineering leaders across the U.S., India, and China. And the report coincides with the release of Karat NextGen, an AI-enabled talent evaluation solution designed to evaluate software engineers in an era of increased human and AI collaboration.

Among the report highlights:

Tech companies and workers are still adjusting to the shifting landscape of an AI-fueled industry that has traditionally relied on coders to help build and maintain the backbone of digital platforms.

When Amazon laid off 14,000 corporate employees from its global workforce in October, among the 2,303 impacted Washington state workers, mostly in Seattle and Bellevue, more than 600 were software development engineers.

That trend mirrored layoffs at Microsoft earlier this year, as companies reassess their engineering needs amid the rise of AI-driven coding tools. 

At Amazon's re:Invent event last week in Las Vegas, AWS executive Colleen Aubrey went beyond discussing how human employees will leverage AI tools, and said instead that it's time to consider agentic teammates “as essential as the people sitting right next to you.”

According to Karat's report, beyond foundational skills such as problem-solving, communication, and product sense, engineers need to be assessed for new AI-native abilities, including familiarity with agentic AI; using AI for coding; integrating 3rd-party AI APIs; prompt engineering; and evaluating and mitigating AI-related risks.

Karat's report found that nearly 70% of engineering leaders plan to strengthen their AI capabilities through strategic hiring. Yet, almost two-thirds of companies still prohibit AI use in interviews, and less than 30% are updating assessments and training interviewers to identify AI-ready talent.

The startup's NextGen talent evaluation platform features a human + AI interview format where candidates tackle complex, multi-file projects with an integrated AI assistant while collaborating live with Karat's expert interview engineers, who probe reasoning, trade-offs, and judgment in real time to reveal genuine engineering ability. 

Sagnik Nandy, CTO at DocuSign, a Karat customer, said in a news release that while AI is transforming engineering, “the real breakthroughs happen when human judgment and AI capabilities work together” and a way to measure that combination reliably is what's been missing.

“A human-led, AI-native interview is exactly the kind of solution organizations need to understand who can truly excel in this new model of development,” Nandy said.

Founded in 2014 by Mo Bhende and Jeff Spector, Karat became one of Seattle's highest-valued startups after it raised $110 million in a Series C round in 2021, which brought its total valuation at the time to $1.1 billion. Total funding to date is $151.6 million.

Karat currently ranks No. 15 on the GeekWire 200, our list of the top startups in the Pacific Northwest.

Apple on Wednesday released its annual list of the most downloaded apps and games for the year. For the U.S. market, OpenAI's ChatGPT topped the ranks of free iPhone apps (not including games) with the most installs in 2025. 

The AI app was followed by Threads, Google, TikTok, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and Google's Gemini.

ChatGPT made it to No. 4 last year, but the top spot was taken by Chinese shopping app Temu. In 2023, the AI app didn't make the top-10 list despite being released on the iPhone in May 2023 to a strong debut.

The fact that ChatGPT is outpacing social networking standbys, and much-needed utilities like Google Maps, indicates how deeply AI has penetrated people's everyday lives here in the U.S. It also demonstrates the potential for OpenAI to disrupt Google's tight hold on the search market on mobile devices, as more people turn to a chatbot for answers first.

There were signs that ChatGPT was on its way to No. 1 earlier in the year — it became the most-downloaded app globally in March, outpacing other top apps like TikTok and Instagram.

Apple also released its list of the top paid apps, the top free and paid games for iPhone and iPad, as well as the top Apple Arcade games.

Block Blast! was the top free game this year, while Minecraft took the crown as the top paid game. On iPad, YouTube was the No. 1 free app, and users downloaded the creativity app Procreate as the top paid game on iPad. Roblox was the top free iPad game.

The full list of top apps and games is below:

Adobe is doubling down on its strategy of using AI to bring more users into its product ecosystem. The company on Wednesday said it is adding features from Photoshop, Express and Acrobat to ChatGPT, letting users ask the chatbot to use these apps to edit images, modify PDFs, or animate elements.

So users can now tell ChatGPT to use Photoshop to edit specific parts of images; remove or blur the background; adjust exposure, brightness, and contrast; or apply various effects. The chatbot will also give you an option to modify the intensity of effects using sliders. 

With support for Express, ChatGPT now lets users tell it to do stuff like fetch existing designs from its library, put together themed creatives, animate elements, and edit designs.

And with Acrobat's PDF editing capabilities, ChatGPT can do things like merge files, edit or extract text or tables within a file, and do more.

If at any point you don't feel like struggling with ChatGPT, you get an option to continue working inside Adobe's apps to finish the job yourself or use features that are not available within ChatGPT.

Adobe said these features will be available globally. While features from all three Adobe apps are available on ChatGPT's desktop, web and iOS apps, only Adobe Express is currently supported on ChatGPT for Android. The company says support for Photoshop and Express is coming soon.

Adobe has shipped many AI-powered features and products this year. In October, the company released AI assistants for Express and Photoshop, and also teased a cross-app assistant, dubbed Project Moonlight. 

It's unclear if Open AI and Adobe have a revenue-sharing arrangement, or

OpenAI started supporting third-party apps inside ChatGPT in October, launching with Canva, Spotify, Expedia and Figma. But as more companies work to bake in their apps within the popular chatbot, the challenge for companies will be getting people to use their app instead of a rival's inside ChatGPT. For instance, you can use both Canva and Photoshop to edit images with the chatbot, but if you don't use either of these apps, you might not have a preference.

Pet wellness company Petco has taken a portion of its Vetco Clinics website offline after a security lapse exposed reams of customers' personal information to the open web. 

After TechCrunch alerted the company to the exposed data relating to Vetco customers and their pets, Petco confirmed in a statement that it was investigating the data leak at its veterinary services company, and declined to comment further. 

The security lapse allowed anyone on the internet to download customer records from Vetco's website without needing a user's login information. At least one customer record was exposed and indexed by Google, allowing anyone to find the data by searching for it.

The customer records, seen by TechCrunch, included visit summaries, medical histories, and prescription and vaccination records, among other files relating to Vetco customers and their pets. 

The files also contained customer names; their home address, email address, and phone number; the location of the Vetco clinic where the services were performed; medical assessments, tests and diagnoses; and the costs of goods, names of veterinarians, consent forms, owner signatures, and dates of service.

We also found animal names, species and breed, their sex, age and date of birth, their microchip number (if registered), their medical vitals, and prescription records in the files.

TechCrunch alerted Petco to the security lapse on Friday after discovering the vulnerability. The company acknowledged the data exposure days later on the following Tuesday after TechCrunch followed-up by attaching several exposed customer files to our email.

Petco spokesperson Ventura Olvera told TechCrunch late on Tuesday that the company has “implemented, and will continue to implement, additional measures to further strengthen the security of our systems,” though the company did not provide evidence for the claim.

Olvera would not say if the company has the technical means, such as logs, to determine if any data was extracted from the company's systems during the course of the data spill.

TechCrunch identified a vulnerability in how Vetco's website generates copies of PDF documents for its customers.

Vetco's customer portal, located at petpass.com, allows customers to log in and obtain veterinary records and other documents relating to their pet's care. But TechCrunch found that the PDF generating page on Vetco's website was public, and not protected with a password.

As such, it was possible for anyone on the internet to access sensitive customer files directly from Vetco's servers by modifying the web address to input a customer's unique identification number. Vetco customer numbers are sequential, which means one could access other customers' data simply by changing a customer number by one or two digits. 

TechCrunch checked at intervals of 100,000 customers to determine how many records may have been exposed in total. The sequential customer numbers suggest that millions of Petco customers' information could have been retrieved.

The bug is classed as an insecure direct object reference (or IDOR), a common lapse in security practices  that allows unfettered access to files on a server because there aren't proper checks in place to make sure the person accessing the data is permitted to.

It's not clear how long these customer records have been left exposed, but the customer record listed on Google was dated mid-2020.

By TechCrunch's count, this is Petco's third data breach in 2025.

Earlier this year, hackers associated with the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters hacking collective allegedly stole reams of data from a database of customer information that Petco hosts with cloud giant Salesforce. The hackers demanded victim companies pay a ransom to not have their information leaked.

In September, Petco disclosed a second data breach involving a security issue that the company said it discovered on its own. Petco blamed the data leak on “a setting within one of our software applications that inadvertently allowed certain files to be accessible online,” but did not provide specific details of the incident. 

That data breach included sensitive customer information, such as Social Security numbers, driver's licenses, and financial information, including debit and credit card numbers.

Olvera declined to say how many people are affected by the September incident, but California law requires companies to disclose data breaches publicly when the number of victims in the state crosses 500 people.

TechCrunch believes this latest data leak involving Vetco is a separate security incident, given that Petco began notifying its customers of the previous data leak several months ago.

Instagram is introducing a new tool that lets you see and control your algorithm, starting with Reels, the company announced on Wednesday. The new tool, called “Your Algorithm,” lets you view the topics that shape your Reels recommendations and customize them to better fit your interests.

When you're watching Reels, you'll see an icon in the upper right corner that looks like two lines with hearts. Tapping on that will open “Your Algorithm.” You will then see what topics Instagram thinks you care about the most. Instagram says your list of interests is determined by your activity and summarized by AI.

For example, you might see a description that reads: “Lately you've been into creativity, sports hype, fitness motivation, and skateboarding.” You can choose to share this description to your Story, so your followers can see what you're into, kind of like you do with your Spotify Wrapped results.

Underneath the summary, you will see the list of topics that Instagram thinks you're interested in. You can select which topics you want to see more or less of, and your recommendations will adapt accordingly. Plus, if you're interested in a topic that isn't listed, you can type it in to add it to your list of interests. 

The move follows TikTok's rollout of its “Manage Topics” feature last year, which allows users to take greater control over what they see on their For You feed. Similar to Instagram's new feature, TikTok lets you tailor your feed to show more or less of certain topics.

However, unlike TikTok, which only displays around a dozen generic topic categories, Instagram's list is personalized to you and lets you add additional topics. 

The new Instagram tool is available starting Wednesday in the U.S. and will roll out globally in English soon. 

In the future, people will be able to use the Your Algorithm tool to personalize their Explore feed, Instagram says. The company plans to bring the tool to more places in the app as well.

Oboe, a learning startup from Anchor co-founders and former Spotify execs Nir Zicherman and Michael Mignano, said today it has raised $16 million in Series A funding led by a16z, with participation from existing investors Eniac, Haystack, Offline, and Factorial. The round also saw investments from individuals such as Adam D'Angelo, Garry Tan, Lenny Rachitsky, Mati Staniszewski, Mikey Shulman, Jared Hecht, and M.G. Siegler.

That platform, which officially launched in September, allows users to define a learning goal and use AI to create a course for them. 

The startup's fundraise comes three months after the app's launch and a year after it raised a $4 million seed round. Zicherman said the reason behind the fresh round is to fuel growth at scale.

“We want to reach billions of people who want to learn about new topics, and it is a very big opportunity,”  he told TechCrunch over a call. “We need to execute faster and reach a larger audience at scale to achieve this vision.” 

“We have a team of successful consumer product builders that can execute well, which gives us an edge over other startups in the market,” he added.

Bryan Kim, a partner at a16z, said that he was impressed by how fast Oboe started generating content on a topic and didn't make users wait behind a loading indicator. 

“We have had a thesis around how AI-aided learning can help people explore new topics and have been looking for the right company. After Oboe launched, we tried it and loved the product. We wanted to back a founder who was ambitious, flexible in adopting different form factors, and understood AI to build a big platform. We found that in Oboe,” he told TechCrunch over a call.

The company is making changes to its core course-generation experience, as well. Earlier, Oboe generated different text and audio formats for users in different styles. Plus, it capped course generation based on the payment plan.

With the new version, the app will first understand your goal and then generate chapters based on that to help you learn about those topics. What's more, users will see other modalities like quizzes appear within the course material seamlessly. For some courses, Oboe will also generate flashcards for you to easily remember course materials.

In terms of audio, instead of having to choose between a podcast format and a lecture format, the company generates a podcast for you and changes its tone based on the learning material and other signals from users. 

Zicherman said that the company observed that there is a high demand among users to learn about STEM topics (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math). The startup has worked on sourcing the best material for these topics, including programming.

He said that good teachers decide what is the best way of learning for students and the company is taking that approach of designing courses for learners.

Oboe is revamping its pricing model to give unlimited course generation to users. 

However, if they want to dive deeper into a topic, they can pay $15 a month ($144 per year) to access more course chapters. There is also a $40 per month ($384 per year) Pro plan, which gives unlimited chapter access and allows users to export or download courses for consumption outside Oboe. The startup said this is suitable for students who want to take printouts of the study material and consume it offline.

Zicherman said that right now Oboe is offering courses in English, but it wants to reach different parts of the world better with localized courses and language support. The platform is currently available on the web, with mobile support planned for the future. 

In the last few years, multiple tools, including Google's NotebookLM and ex-Google employees' Huxe, allow you to enter a prompt to get a podcast episode to explore a topic. While these are one-off generations, Oboe's approach is to let you dive deeper into the topic with chapter-based learning.

Enhanced geothermal startup Fervo Energy has raised $462 million to complete its first large-scale power plant and begin development on several others as it races to provide electricity to a power-hungry grid.

The new funds will help the company continue work on its 500-megawatt Cape Station power plant in Utah while starting development on several others, Sarah Jewett, senior vice president of strategy at Fervo, told TechCrunch.

The new round was led by B Capital with participation from AllianceBernstein, Atacama Ventures, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, CalSTRS, Capricorn Investment Group, Carbon Equity, Centaurus Capital, Climate First, Congruent Ventures, CPP Investments, Devon Energy, Echelon, Galvanize, Google, Impact Science Ventures, Kris Singh, JB Straubel, Liberty Mutual Investments, Marunouchi Innovation Partners, Mercuria, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mitsui & Co., and Sabanci Climate Ventures.

Fervo has an existing deal with Google to supply it with electricity for its data centers.

The company has targeted 2026 to bring the first phase of Cape Station online, and Jewett confirmed that it will be “mechanically complete” this year. “It's very real and very tangible.”

The new round comes six months after the startup announced a $206 million financing package, including loans and project-level preferred equity, for Cape Station. Last year, Fervo raised nearly $500 million in equity and debt.

Enhanced geothermal has been in development for years but has recently soared as favorable conditions have lifted its prospects. 

Chief among them is rising data center demand. Large tech companies like Google and Meta have been eyeing geothermal as a potential solution to their energy needs. Earlier this year, an analysis by the Rhodium Group found that by 2030, enhanced geothermal could provide nearly two-thirds of new data center demand at or below what operators are paying today.

Geothermal is also viewed favorably within the Trump administration. Energy secretary Chris Wright's previous company, Liberty Energy, participated in a $138 million round that Fervo raised in 2022. Like many of its peers, the company uses fracking and directional drilling techniques borrowed from the oil and gas industry. Many Fervo employees used to work in oil and gas, applying their knowledge of drilling and subsurface development to a new challenge.

Fervo is considered a frontrunner among enhanced geothermal startups, which drill deeper than existing geothermal developers to tap hotter rocks and deliver more power.

That knowledge has helped Fervo bring down the time it takes to drill a new well. The company's first wells took about a month, but this summer, Fervo announced that it had completed one in 16 days. “We are in the mid-teens these days, on average, for our well drilling times,” Jewett said. “That is pretty good, but we always have more improvements to make.”

The company's obsession with drilling time is both economic and a point of pride. “Roughly half the cost of wells is in the drilling time,” Jewett said. Shorter drilling times mean that Fervo can complete power plants more quickly, bringing in revenue sooner. They're also a sign of mastery. “It's also a good representation of how much you're investing in the well, how much you're troubleshooting, how many issues are plaguing you that end up costing money,” she said.

For now, Fervo is focused on the western U.S., where hot rocks sit closer to the surface. At the company's Cape Station site in Utah, for example, Fervo has to drill down 8,500 feet to tap into 450°F rock. 

“If you go to Pennsylvania or West Virginia, [the hot rock] exists much lower,” Jewett said. Only after the company is comfortable with how quickly it can drill a well in the West will it expand elsewhere, including abroad.

“There are a lot of really high-potential places across the world,” she said.

Within the U.S., though, there are plenty of different types of rock for Fervo to drill through, giving it the potential to build up sufficient technical experience before heading to other countries. By that point, Jewett expects that differences in regulations will be the primary hurdle.

Given skyrocketing energy demand from data centers and Fervo's progress at Cape Station, there have been rumors that the company might file to go public in the coming year or so. Jewett wouldn't comment on those, but she said that the company is seeing “off-the-charts demand.”

If you're in a ""selling stock"" part of your life I understand, but if you're in a ""buying stock"" part of your life it's worth reflecting on the quote until you can shake the ""recent price action IS investor psychology"" out of your head.

reply

Even when people are only buying with no intent to sell, they'll often complain if prices fall right after they've bought an item, and ask for a rebate for the difference, because they feel they deserve the new lower price. Many retailers are aware of this psychology and do offer some sort of forward-looking price match, both to help buyers overcome that hesitation, and to avoid going through the paperwork of returning and refunding a used item just to sell the same thing again anyway. But the stock market offers no such buyer protections.

- A rule of thumb suggested by one study is that every $100 drop in stock market wealth leads, on average, to a $3.20 drop in consumer spending. Under such an assumption, a dotcom-style crash would cut American consumption by about $890bn, or 2.9% of GDP.

More important for the wider economy is how much liquidity it destroyed and the mayhem it will do in the bond markets.But, since the top 10% of American savers (including almost all of US Congress) put most of their savings in stocks they will get a massive bailout.

AI has a lot of rich people riding on its success, and this time's different for, IMO, two major reasons...- First, the companies most invested in AI are perfusing it everywhere. Many parts of these big businesses, if not the business as a whole, is invested heavily in the success of LLM-based products. Microsoft is probably the poster child for this, where you can't use practically any of their modern products without copilot or some such being shoved in your face. OpenAI and Anthropic are both companies whose existence is predicated only by a viable LLM-based product. Nvidia and (as of their last-week's announcement) Micron are both now also heavily invested in the success of this technology, though they're also surely not the only companies in the hardware sector to be following this path to some degree.- Second, the actual individuals behind these companies are the world's richest people, and much of their fortune comes from stock in these companies, and loans taken out against that stock.  They stand to *personally* lose a significant-even-to-them sum of money if the bottom falls out of this thing. If this weren't the case, I'm absolutely certain we wouldn't be seeing as much reporting about how an AI crash would hurt the average household. When smaller crashes happen (even those that affect more average households), it's inevitable, or it's good for the economy in the long-term (it's a correction, after all -- how could that possibly be bad?), or it's the consequence of people's personal choice to invest one way or another, but because the uber-rich were spared, it's *not really that bad.*

This is a disgusting turn in the state of journalism. I don't pretend know what comes next, or how this can be remedied. Crowdsourced news is as prone to manipulation as ""traditional"" centralized news, so that's not it, and I don't think people have the depth of knowledge to use something purely fact-based (like bellingcat) for every domain of day-to-day life (which is less an effect of the US education system being in continuous decline over decades, and more an effect of the cognitive load it takes to be familiar enough with everything to be able to draw reasonable conclusions about it.

If this weren't the case, I'm absolutely certain we wouldn't be seeing as much reporting about how an AI crash would hurt the average household. When smaller crashes happen (even those that affect more average households), it's inevitable, or it's good for the economy in the long-term (it's a correction, after all -- how could that possibly be bad?), or it's the consequence of people's personal choice to invest one way or another, but because the uber-rich were spared, it's *not really that bad.*

This is a disgusting turn in the state of journalism. I don't pretend know what comes next, or how this can be remedied.

You spent $X to buy RAM chips, expecting that you could produce $Y with it. But you didn't. So you (1) failed to realize the expected value $Y, and (2) misallocated $X, which in hindsight you would have used differently.Again, that's all learning that future expectations do not match reality.The decision/action happened earlier, and is separate from the realization. Attributing the material loss to the realization is misplaced.

You also need a lot of money to purchase land, so this effectively allows banks to make a lot of money on overly inflated price of land.Land by itself doesn't generate wealth, only improvements on top of it does. Only problem is that we tax improvement along with the land, leading to the perverse incentive that building anything increases your tax burden. We call them property tax.

You can sort of think of a house as an I bond you can live in [1], and the return is the equity gains (historically). You need lots of money to buy land because demand outstrips supply, there is a shortage of ~4M housing units in the US, and the pipeline for building new housing was permanently impaired after the 2008 global financial crisis. We will never build as fast as we used to as we go into structural demographic labor shortages in the US; the value of existing real estate is ancient embodied construction productivity and material costs, similar to how oil is ancient sunlight.[1] The Rate of Return on Everything, 1870–2015 - https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/wp2017-25.pdf | https://doi.org/10.24148/wp2017-25

The government can generate money in the short term by changing lending rates (""the Prime""), which allows you to buy more for less interest, which encourages purchases. The long-term effect includes paying off that interest, of course, and someone still has to want to loan money at that rate; if the Prime went to zero your credit card rates still wouldn't be zero.

The worst was the free copy of Heinlein's _Space Cadet_ I got from Sony on my PRS-505 because I was browsing their store on a day when they offered a $10 credit --- it was so riddled w/ typos that I had to get a print copy from the library to determine what some of them were.... the hilarious thing is that that ""purchase"" made me eligible for the ebook price fixing settlement, really should have kept and framed that check.

reply

This is unacceptable. Typo's are not just aggravating but as they accumulate they begin to veer towards mutating the authors original intent.

reply

Don't get me started on the typos in Lost Art Press's _Virtuoso: The Tool Cabinet and Workbench of Henry O. Studley_ --- they mis-spelled the subject's name on the inside cover and duplicated one photo, so a pair of flat pliers is shown twice and there is not detail photo of the iconic twin pair of jeweler's pliers, and didn't do a ""cancel"" reprinting that page as any reputable publisher would.

Personally, I need to not stare at a screen at some point and need to use print. It would be great if Amazon or someone else had a service that would take pdfs and epubs print them as mass market paperback and ships it to you. A lot of content is kindle/digital only these days unfortunately. I would think it won't cost > $20 per-print, I'd be willing to pay twice that plus shipping. Even for older books, you can only get used versions, and even then if  you're lucky. It would be nice if the digital versions were available for on-demand printing.

by Tim Brady12/10/2025

Today, Meesho, one of India's leading online retail and merchant tools companies, goes public. It is the second YC company to be listed in India.

We met Meesho's founders, Vidit and Sanjeev, three months into their journey. They applied to the Summer 2016 YC batch just after they launched their website. According to their application, they had 300 users at the time. As with most beginnings of great startups, they had a pretty clear idea of the problem they were solving, but hadn't figured out the solution yet.

Their problem was this: very small merchants represented a large percentage of the total online retail market in India, and those merchants were being underserved by the existing tool sets. Shopify and Bigcommerce, the existing tool providers at the time, were too expensive and too heavyweight for their needs. The example they gave during their interview was that of a homemaker who had a side business selling sarees to her friends and neighbors. She did this primarily over WhatsApp and Facebook.

While selling sarees to your neighbors didn't scream ‘big opportunity', the India-specific example was foreign enough to the two American and one Australian interviewers that it kept us on our toes. Going into the interview, we thought the Indian online retail market was already crowded, with the likes of Flipkart, Zomato, and Amazon India. But from their example, it became clear that we didn't know what we didn't know. The statistic that got our attention was that 3M Indians were selling (mostly apparel) on Facebook, and less than 5% had websites. For reference, there are a total of 3M small retailers (online and offline) in the entire US.  This was a big opportunity.

Meesho's startup journey is not the tale of a rocketship to the moon. Rather, it was a decade-long grind of long days and disciplined product development. It is a tale of constantly asking customers what they need and then quickly and relentlessly iterating and testing solutions. It's a tale of not shying away from hard problems. They started out by creating e-commerce tools that integrated with Facebook's Graph API. These tools helped sell and track orders. The tools got better and better, and the number of merchants grew along with those improvements.

By staying close to their customer, the team soon realized that supply chain logistics and shipping problems were the biggest impediments to their merchants' growth. But as we all learned during COVID, supply chains are complicated and fragile. Improving supply chains is a hard problem. Rather than shy away, they leaned in. By doing so, they not only solved their customers' problems but also built a business that is not easily copycatted.

Next, they learned that their merchants wanted to drive more traffic in order to grow. Recognizing the growing importance of influencers and online content in purchasing decisions, they built tools for these creators in order to drive that traffic. Then, in 2021, six years after they started Meesho, they launched a consumer-facing app and website, competing with the likes of Flipkart and Amazon India. It turns out that India's online retail market wasn't that crowded after all.

Over the course of 10 years, Meesho has methodically built their company by relentlessly listening to their customers. They have followed where their customers' problems led them. In doing so, they have helped India harness the energy of its small business entrepreneurs. Their tale should serve as a great example to all startups.

Similar, but I think it might actually be dumber. When you take a deep dive you're jumping headfirst into things you don't understand, with the outcome largely unknown to you. When you double down on something you're already aware that it isn't working, but you persist anyway under the delusion that doing the same thing more aggressively will make your bad plan succeed.

And why many scientists are freaked out about the first serious for-profit company moving into the solar geoengineering field.

Stardust Solutions believes that it can solve climate change—for a price.

The Israel-based geoengineering startup has said it expects  nations will soon pay it more than a billion dollars a year to launch specially equipped aircraft into the stratosphere. Once they've reached the necessary altitude, those planes will disperse particles engineered to reflect away enough sunlight to cool down the planet, purportedly without causing environmental side effects. 

The proprietary (and still secret) particles could counteract all the greenhouse gases the world has emitted over the last 150 years, the company stated in a 2023 pitch deck it presented to venture capital firms. In fact, it's the “only technologically feasible solution” to climate change, the company said.

The company disclosed it raised $60 million in funding in October, marking by far the largest known funding round to date for a startup working on solar geoengineering.

Stardust is, in a sense, the embodiment of Silicon Valley's simmering frustration with the pace of academic research on the technology. It's a multimillion-dollar bet that a startup mindset can advance research and development that has crept along amid scientific caution and public queasiness.

But numerous researchers focused on solar geoengineering are deeply skeptical that Stardust will line up the government customers it would need to carry out a global deployment as early as 2035, the plan described in its earlier investor materials—and aghast at the suggestion that it ever expected to move that fast. They're also highly critical of the idea that a company would take on the high-stakes task of setting the global temperature, rather than leaving it to publicly funded research programs.

“They've ignored every recommendation from everyone and think they can turn a profit in this field,” says Douglas MacMartin, an associate professor at Cornell University who studies solar geoengineering. “I think it's going to backfire. Their investors are going to be dumping their money down the drain, and it will set back the field.”

The company has finally emerged from stealth mode after completing its funding round, and its CEO, Yanai Yedvab, agreed to conduct one of the company's first extensive interviews with MIT Technology Review for this story.Yedvab walked back those ambitious projections a little, stressing that the actual timing of any stratospheric experiments, demonstrations, or deployments will be determined by when governments decide it's appropriate to carry them out. Stardust has stated clearly that it will move ahead with solar geoengineering only if nations pay it to proceed, and only once there are established rules and bodies guiding the use of the technology.

That decision, he says, will likely be dictated by how bad climate change becomes in the coming years.

“It could be a situation where we are at the place we are now, which is definitely not great,” he says. “But it could be much worse. We're saying we'd better be ready.”

“It's not for us to decide, and I'll say humbly, it's not for these researchers to decide,” he adds. “It's the sense of urgency that will dictate how this will evolve.”

No one is questioning the scientific credentials of Stardust. The company was founded in 2023 by a trio of prominent researchers, including Yedvab, who served as deputy chief scientist at the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission. The company's lead scientist, Eli Waxman, is the head of the department of particle physics and astrophysics at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Amyad Spector, the chief product officer, was previously a nuclear physicist at Israel's secretive Negev Nuclear Research Center.

Stardust says it employs 25 scientists, engineers, and academics. The company is based in Ness Ziona, Israel, and plans to open a US headquarters soon. 

Yedvab says the motivation for starting Stardust was simply to help develop an effective means of addressing climate change. 

“Maybe something in our experience, in the tool set that we bring, can help us in contributing to solving one of the greatest problems humanity faces,” he says.

Lowercarbon Capital, the climate-tech-focused investment firm  cofounded by the prominent tech investor Chris Sacca, led the $60 million investment round. Future Positive, Future Ventures, and Never Lift Ventures, among others, participated as well.AWZ Ventures, a firm focused on security and intelligence technologies, co-led the company's earlier seed round, which totaled $15 million.

Yedvab says the company will use that money to advance research, development, and testing for the three components of its system, which are also described in the pitch deck: safe particles that could be affordably manufactured; aircraft dispersion systems; and a means of tracking particles and monitoring their effects.

“Essentially, the idea is to develop all these building blocks and to upgrade them to a level that will allow us to give governments the tool set and all the required information to make decisions about whether and how to deploy this solution,” he says. 

The company is, in many ways, the opposite of Make Sunsets, the first company that came along offering to send particles into the stratosphere—for a fee—by pumping sulfur dioxide into weather balloons and hand-releasing them into the sky. Many researchers viewed it as a provocative, unscientific, and irresponsible exercise in attention-gathering. 

But Stardust is serious, and now it's raised serious money from serious people—all of which raises the stakes for the solar geoengineering field and, some fear, increases the odds that the world will eventually put the technology to use.

“That marks a turning point in that these types of actors are not only possible, but are real,” says Shuchi Talati, executive director of the Alliance for Just Deliberation on Solar Geoengineering, a nonprofit that strives to ensure that developing nations are included in the global debate over such climate interventions. “We're in a more dangerous era now.”

Many scientists studying solar geoengineering argue strongly that universities, governments, and transparent nonprofits should lead the work in the field, given the potential dangers and deep public concerns surrounding a tool with the power to alter the climate of the planet. 

It's essential to carry out the research with appropriate oversight, explore the potential downsides of these approaches, and publicly publish the results “to ensure there's no bias in the findings and no ulterior motives in pushing one way or another on deployment or not,” MacMartin says. “[It] shouldn't be foisted upon people without proper and adequate information.”He criticized, for instance, the company's claims to have developed what he described as their “magic aerosol particle,” arguing that the assertion that it is perfectly safe and inert can't be trusted without published findings. Other scientists have also disputed those scientific claims.

Plenty of other academics say solar geoengineering shouldn't be studied at all, fearing that merely investigating it starts the world down a slippery slope toward its use and diminishes the pressures to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. In 2022, hundreds of them signed an open letter calling for a global ban on the development and use of the technology, adding the concern that there is no conceivable way for the world's nations to pull together to establish rules or make collective decisions ensuring that it would be used in “a fair, inclusive, and effective manner.”

“Solar geoengineering is not necessary,” the authors wrote. “Neither is it desirable, ethical, or politically governable in the current context.”

Stardust says it's important to pursue the possibility of solar geoengineering because the dangers of climate change are accelerating faster than the world's ability to respond to it, requiring a new “class of solution … that buys us time and protects us from overheating.”

Yedvab says he and his colleagues thought hard about the right structure for the organization, finally deciding that for-profits working in parallel with academic researchers have delivered “most of the groundbreaking technologies” in recent decades. He cited advances in genome sequencing, space exploration, and drug development, as well as the restoration of the ozone layer.

He added that a for-profit structure was also required to raise funds and attract the necessary talent.

“There is no way we could, unfortunately, raise even a small portion of this amount by philanthropic resources or grants these days,” he says.

He adds that while academics have conducted lots of basic science in solar geoengineering, they've done very little in terms of building the technological capacities. Their geoengineering research is also primarily focused on the potential use of sulfur dioxide, because it is known to help reduce global temperatures after volcanic eruptions blast massive amounts of it into the stratospheric. But it has well-documented downsides as well, including harm to the protective ozone layer.

“It seems natural that we need better options, and this is why we started Stardust: to develop this safe, practical, and responsible solution,” the company said in a follow-up email. “Eventually, policymakers will need to evaluate and compare these options, and we're confident that our option will be superior over sulfuric acid primarily in terms of safety and practicability.”

Public trust can be won not by excluding private companies, but by setting up regulations and organizations to oversee this space, much as the US Food and Drug Administration does for pharmaceuticals, Yedvab says.“There is no way this field could move forward if you don't have this governance framework, if you don't have external validation, if you don't have clear regulation,” he says.

Meanwhile, the company says it intends to operate transparently, pledging to publish its findings whether they're favorable or not.

That will include finally revealing details about the particles it has developed, Yedvab says. 

Early next year, the company and its collaborators will begin publishing data or evidence “substantiating all the claims and disclosing all the information,” he says, “so that everyone in the scientific community can actually check whether we checked all these boxes.”

In the follow-up email, the company acknowledged that solar geoengineering isn't a “silver bullet” but said it is “the only tool that will enable us to cool the planet in the short term, as part of a larger arsenal of technologies.”

“The only way governments could be in a position to consider [solar geoengineering] is if the work has been done to research, de-risk, and engineer safe and responsible solutions—which is what we see as our role,” the company added later. “We are hopeful that research will continue not just from us, but also from academic institutions, nonprofits, and other responsible companies that may emerge in the future.”

Stardust's earlier pitch deck stated that the company expected to conduct its first “stratospheric aerial experiments” last year, though those did not move ahead (more on that in a moment).

On another slide, the company said it expected to carry out a “large-scale demonstration” around 2030 and proceed to a “global full-scale deployment” by about 2035. It said it expected to bring in roughly $200 million and $1.5 billion in annual revenue by those periods, respectively.

Every researcher interviewed for this story was adamant that such a deployment should not happen so quickly.

Given the global but uneven and unpredictable impacts of solar geoengineering, any decision to use the technology should be reached through an inclusive, global agreement, not through the unilateral decisions of individual nations, Talati argues. 

“We won't have any sort of international agreement by that point given where we are right now,” she says.

A global agreement, to be clear, is a big step beyond setting up rules and oversight bodies—and some believe that such an agreement on a technology so divisive could never be achieved.

There's also still a vast amount of research that must be done to better understand the negative side effects of solar geoengineering generally and any ecological impacts of Stardust's materials specifically, adds Holly Buck, an associate professor at the University of Buffalo and author of After Geoengineering.

“It is irresponsible to talk about deploying stratospheric aerosol injection without fundamental research about its impacts,” Buck wrote in an email.

She says the timelines are also “unrealistic” because there are profound public concerns about the technology. Her polling work found that a significant fraction of the US public opposes even research (though polling varies widely). 

Meanwhile, most academic efforts to move ahead with even small-scale outdoor experiments have sparked fierce backlash. That includes the years-long effort by researchers then at Harvard to carry out a basic equipment test for their so-called ScopeX experiment. The high-altitude balloon would have launched from a flight center in Sweden, but the test was ultimately scratched amid objections from environmentalists and Indigenous groups. 

Given this baseline of public distrust, Stardust's for-profit proposals only threaten to further inflame public fears, Buck says.

“I find the whole proposal incredibly socially naive,” she says. “We actually could use serious research in this field, but proposals like this diminish the chances of that happening.”

Those public fears, which cross the political divide, also mean politicians will see little to no political upside to paying Stardust to move ahead, MacMartin says.

“If you don't have the constituency for research, it seems implausible to me that you'd turn around and give money to an Israeli company to deploy it,” he says.

An added risk is that if one nation or a small coalition forges ahead without broader agreement, it could provoke geopolitical conflicts. 

“What if Russia wants it a couple of degrees warmer, and India a couple of degrees cooler?” asked Alan Robock, a professor at Rutgers University, in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 2008. “Should global climate be reset to preindustrial temperature or kept constant at today's reading? Would it be possible to tailor the climate of each region of the planet independently without affecting the others? If we proceed with geoengineering, will we provoke future climate wars?”

Yedvab says the pitch deck reflected Stardust's strategy at a “very early stage in our work,” adding that their thinking has “evolved,” partly in response to consultations with experts in the field.

He says that the company will have the technological capacity to move ahead with demonstrations and deployments on the timelines it laid out but adds, “That's a necessary but not sufficient condition.”

“Governments will need to decide where they want to take it, if at all,” he says. “It could be a case that they will say ‘We want to move forward.' It could be a case that they will say ‘We want to wait a few years.'”“It's for them to make these decisions,” he says.

Yedvab acknowledges that the company has conducted flights in the lower atmosphere to test its monitoring system, using white smoke as a simulant for its particles, as the Wall Street Journal reported last year. It's also done indoor tests of the dispersion system and its particles in a wind tunnel set up within its facility.

But in response to criticisms like the ones above, Yedvab says the company hasn't conducted outdoor particle experiments and won't move forward with them until it has approval from governments. 

“Eventually, there will be a need to conduct outdoor testing,” he says. “There is no way you can validate any solution without outdoor testing.” But such testing of sunlight reflection technology, he says, “should be done only working together with government and under these supervisions.”

Stardust may be willing to wait for governments to be ready to deploy its system, but there's no guarantee that its investors will have the same patience. In accepting tens of millions in venture capital, Stardust may now face financial pressures that could “drive the timelines,” says Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia University. 

And that raises a different set of concerns.

Obliged to deliver returns, the company might feel it must strive to convince government leaders that they should pay for its services, Talati says. 

“The whole point of having companies and investors is you want your thing to be used,” she says. “There's a massive incentive to lobby countries to use it, and that's the whole danger of having for-profit companies here.”

She argues those financial incentives threaten to accelerate the use of solar geoengineering ahead of broader international agreements and elevate business interests above the broader public good.

Stardust has “quietly begun lobbying on Capitol Hill” and has hired the law firm Holland & Knight, according to Politico.

It has also worked with Red Duke Strategies, a consulting firm based in McLean, Virginia, to develop “strategic relationships and communications that promote understanding and enable scientific testing,” according to a case study on the company's  website. 

“The company needed to secure both buy-in and support from the United States government and other influential stakeholders to move forward,” Red Duke states. “This effort demanded a well-connected and authoritative partner who could introduce Stardust to a group of experts able to research, validate, deploy, and regulate its SRM technology.”

Red Duke didn't respond to an inquiry from MIT Technology Review. Stardust says its work with the consulting firm was not a government lobbying effort.

Yedvab acknowledges that the company is meeting with government leaders in the US, Europe, its own region, and the Global South. But he stresses that it's not asking any country to contribute funding or to sign off on deployments at this stage. Instead, it's making the case for nations to begin crafting policies to regulate solar geoengineering.

“When we speak to policymakers—and we speak to policymakers; we don't hide it—essentially, what we tell them is ‘Listen, there is a solution,'” he says. “‘It's not decades away—it's a few years away. And it's your role as policymakers to set the rules of this field.'”

“Any solution needs checks and balances,” he says. “This is how we see the checks and balances.”

He says the best-case scenario is still a rollout of clean energy technologies that accelerates rapidly enough to drive down emissions and curb climate change.

“We are perfectly fine with building an option that will sit on the shelf,” he says. “We'll go and do something else. We have a great team and are confident that we can find also other problems to work with.”

He says the company's investors are aware of and comfortable with that possibility, supportive of the principles that will guide Stardust's work, and willing to wait for regulations and government contracts.

Lowercarbon Capital didn't respond to an inquiry from MIT Technology Review.

Others have certainly imagined the alternative scenario Yedvab raises: that nations will increasingly support the idea of geoengineering in the face of mounting climate catastrophes. 

In Kim Stanley Robinson's 2020 novel, The Ministry for the Future, India unilaterally forges ahead with solar geoengineering following a heat wave that kills millions of people. 

Wagner sketched a variation on that scenario in his 2021 book, Geoengineering: The Gamble, speculating that a small coalition of nations might kick-start a rapid research and deployment program as an emergency response to escalating humanitarian crises. In his version, the Philippines offers to serve as the launch site after a series of super-cyclones batter the island nation, forcing millions from their homes. 

It's impossible to know today how the world will react if one nation or a few go it alone, or whether nations could come to agreement on where the global temperature should be set. 

But the lure of solar geoengineering could become increasingly enticing as more and more nations endure mass suffering, starvation, displacement, and death.

“We understand that probably it will not be perfect,” Yedvab says. “We understand all the obstacles, but there is this sentiment of hope, or cautious hope, that we have a way out of this dark corridor we are currently in.”

“I think that this sentiment of hope is something that gives us a lot of energy to move on forward,” he adds. 

Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage can scale faster than other approaches. But some experts are dubious about the climate benefits.

We got a sneak peek inside Found Energy's lab, just as it gears up to supply heat and hydrogen to its first customer. 

How AI and renewables are shifting the energy landscape.

Companies have still drawn down only enough CO2 to cancel out a few hours of US emissions. Here's what it will take to really scale up the sector.

We've been waiting for what feels like almost as long as Aang's freezing for the return of the live-action The Last Airbender remake, and part of that wait being so painful is for good reason. Season two of the show is bringing us one of the animated series' most beloved characters in the form of Toph Beifong: so it's no surprise our first look at it really makes her the star.

Yeah, sure, we also get glimpses of Aang and the rest of the gang as they continue on their quest to train the young airbender in mastery of the other elements, as well as Zuko and Iroh's growing bond together, but Netflix's first trailer for season 2 puts Miya Cech's version of Toph front and center.

Of course, aside from Toph herself narrating the trailer, we get to see a little of how the show will handle her earthbending skills, but we also get to see how the show is going to approach her blindness, taking a desaturated, thrumming effect to show her use of sound and vibrations to echolocate her surroundings.

So far, so Toph, but we also know the live-action series will make some changes to the character to make her less of the tomboy she was in the animated show, with Cech previously telling press that her Toph will play in a more feminine attitude in comparison, telling The Direct earlier this year that “I wanted to work into a very humanizing space for her because she was [originally] a cartoon.”

Of course, the animated series wasn't unafraid of showing off that side of Toph either—acknowledging her occasional desire to want to do feminine things was part of her growing bond with Katara—but it'll be interesting to see just how the live-action show interprets that, as much as it's interesting to see how she'll fling rocks and navigate the world around her.

The live-action Avatar: The Last Airbender returns to Netflix some time in 2026.

It's a disquieting new holiday tradition: a major corporation that should know not to dunk its reputation in the sewer celebrates the holidays by releasing a punishing, demonic commercial made with the latest batch of AI doohickeys.

This time, the perpetrator is McDonald's:

McDonald's has released an AI-generated Christmas ad The studio behind it says they ‘hardly slept' for several weeks while writing AI prompts and refining the shots — ‘AI didn't make this film. We did' Comments have been turned off on YouTube

[image or embed]

— Culture Crave 🍿 (@culturecrave.co) December 8, 2025 at 11:19 AM



It's about how much the holiday season sucks. Get it? It's also genuinely hard to sit through because at every level from the subtle to the screechingly obvious, it looks and sounds all wrong.

Everyone hates it. Everyone. For instance, I disagree with Matt Walsh about just about everything, but folks, Matt Walsh is right:

I don't care if it wasn't AI. Making your ad all about calling Christmas the most terrible time of the year is a bigger problem. Gfy @McDonalds

— FreshOutOfPatience (@noname131252) December 10, 2025



According to Adforum, where a full video of the ad is still being hosted, it was commissioned by a firm called TBWA\NEBOKO in the Netherlands, presumably for the Dutch market. But the original YouTube channel that hosted the ad has already taken it private.

According to a post on the site 80 Level, the studio that produced this for TBWA/NEBEKO is called The Sweetshop, and it released a puzzling statement (apparently also now deleted) that reads like it was confused about why there was a backlash:

“For seven weeks, we hardly slept, with up to 10 of our in-house AI and post specialists at The Gardening Club working in lockstep with the directors. Every shot travelled through a rigorously engineered toolchain: real Google Earth plates, advanced style-transfer, pixel-level photo repair, custom LoRAs, control nets, bespoke ComfyUI graphs, and thousands upon thousands of tightly steered iterations.

Then came compositing, lighting balance, physics corrections, artefact removal, and final finishing in Flame. We generated what felt like dailies – thousands of takes – then shaped them in the edit just as we would on any high-craft production. This wasn't an AI trick. It was a film. And here's the thing I wish more people understood: magic isn't the technology. The magic is the team behind it, people who pushed, questioned, experimented, swore at broken models, solved impossible problems, and refused to stop until every frame felt cinematic.

I don't see this spot as a novelty or a cute seasonal experiment. To me, it's evidence of something much bigger: that when craft and technology meet with intention, they can create work that feels genuinely cinematic. So no – AI didn't make this film. We did.”

People weren't upset because using AI is cheating. They were reacting to a bad commercial. This might be overkill, but I've watched this thing a few dozen times now, and here's what's wrong with it for the benefit of the folks who made it:

The jingle is a parody of the holiday standard “It's The Most Wonderful Time of the Year” that sounds like it was made by prompting a music generator to be grouchy about Christmas. Rather than a cute ditty, it produced something discordant and unexpectedly halting that breaks away from the original melody and meter and meanders down unsatisfying lyrical rabbit holes.

Few if any of the scenarios produce any feeling of recognition. I suppose a lot of this is because they're AI generations, but it's also because the situations aren't relatable. For a montage like this, each clip should play out a scenario from a familiar holiday gripe. Who has ever cheerfully wassailed in gale force winds? Who has battled another shopper on Black Friday over a generic teddy bear? Who can relate to the guy trying to pedal up an icy slope in a combination pedicab-wheelbarrow with a 12-foot Christmas tree sticking out? Even if you're Dutch, I can't imagine this makes sense.

At 0:20, the diners at the Christmas feast with the centerpiece on fire appear to be having a great time, and seem disappointed by someone putting it out with a fire extinguisher. At 0:30, the cat that jumps onto the tree doesn't seem to pull the tree down. It looks more like the tree is rotating downward on a hinge like the gate in a parking garage. The AI can't seem to decide if the couple at 0:36 is inside the cozy interior of a McDonald's or outside in a bitterly cold rainstorm.

But moreover, this message is just off the mark for 2025. This kind of unsubtle “bad attitude” humor was all the rage in the 90s, when a t-shirt could have a slogan like “Life sucks!” printed on it and people at beach town souvenir stores would spend millions on it. In fact, “It's The Most Wonderful Time of the Year” was used to great effect 29 years ago in this Staples commercial from back-to-school season about a dad who hates his children, as was the style at the time:

While this ad is mean, it at least has people in it, and you can't help but feel something when a human actor conveys an emotion successfully. AI cannot do this and never will.

I hope that helps. Merry Christmas!

For months now, foreigners and even dual citizens have been worried about how their social media histories might affect their ability to travel freely to and from the U.S. It's increasingly clear that the answer is a lot.

On Tuesday at the Federal Register, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol posted a proposed policy tweak: It now plans to dig around in tourists' social media histories before letting them enter, even if they're coming from some of the least scrutinized countries in the world.

According to its statement CBP “invites the public to comment” on a series of newly proposed changes. Here's number 3:

“3. Mandatory Social Media:

In order to comply with the January 2025 Executive Order 14161 (Protecting the United States From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats), CBP is adding social media as a mandatory data element for an ESTA application. The data element will require ESTA applicants to provide their social media from the last 5 years.”

Note that this is for “ESTA” applicants meaning the Electronic System for Travel Authorization. This isn't some additional crackdown on people, say, affiliated with countries covered by Trump's travel ban—places like Afghanistan, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. This is aimed at travelers from visa waiver countries, places whose citizens are theoretically welcomed with open arms. Once they obtain a $40 authorization through ESTA—which, funnily enough, has an app—people from visa waiver countries like Australia, Japan, France, Iceland, the United Kingdom and South Korea are normally able to travel around the U.S. freely for 90 days.

C.B.P. also plans to require other personal information, such as email addresses from the last ten years, and the addresses, birth dates, and other identifying details of all family members of ESTA applicants.

This isn't the first such social media crackdown. Earlier this month, the State Department announced a an expansion of the screening process for people applying for H-1B and Dependent H-4 visas—people who plan to move to the U.S. for work reasons. If you're in this group, you're told to “adjust the privacy settings on all of [your] social media profiles to ‘public,'” as part of the application process, and there's no mention of only checking what you've posted in the past five years.

Speaking to the New York Times, Bo Cooper, a representative of the immigration firm Fragomen said of the checks on tourists' social media posts that since the process “involves looking at online speech, and then denying travel based on discretion and policy” about what people have expressed, “It'll be interesting to watch the tourism numbers.”

A June study from the World Travel and Tourism Council (as cited by Forbes) found that among the 184 countries it analyzed, the U.S. was the only one expected to see declining tourism numbers in 2025.

You don't need a passion for graphic design to use Adobe's biggest image and document editing tools anymore.

Starting today, Photoshop, Express, and Acrobat are integrated into OpenAI's ChatGPT. The new integrations will allow users to tap into Adobe's editing tools using plain-language prompts.

“Now hundreds of millions of people can edit with Photoshop simply by using their own words, right inside a platform that's already part of their day-to-day,” said Adobe President of Digital Media David Wadhwani in a press release.

This is the latest move in OpenAI's push to bring apps into its chatbot, making it function more like an operating system. In October, OpenAI announced that users would be able to use services like Canva, Figma, Spotify, and Zillow on the platform. At the time, it also teased app integrations from other partners, like Peloton, DoorDash, and Uber were also coming soon.

For Adobe, this expands its recent AI strategy. Earlier this year, the company introduced an agentic AI assistant on Photoshop and a more conversational AI assistant to Adobe Express and Adobe Firefly. Now, it's bringing its tools to ChatGPT and its 800 million users. 

ChatGPT users can now upload images and just include “Adobe Photoshop” in their prompt to start making edits to a photo. They can adjust specific parts of an image and fine-tune settings like brightness, contrast, and exposure, as well as add creative effects by typing what they want. After each edit, users can click on the image, and a slider appears to adjust the intensity of the edit or effect.

Adobe Express, the company's program for creating graphics like flyers, logos, and posters, works similarly on ChatGPT. For example, users can type a prompt like “Adobe Express, help me create an invitation for my dance party.” Then, they can pick from Adobe's library of templates and ask ChatGPT to make further edits to the graphic's copy, layout, and images.

Finally, Acrobat on ChatGPT lets users edit PDFs, merge files, convert documents, and even redact sensitive information directly via the chatbot.

Users will still need to open Adobe's actual software programs, each of which has a web browser version, for more extensive edits.

While these integrations are currently free to use, that may not always be the case. But for now, expect a very limited experience. People who use ChatGPT to generate images may find the addition of Adobe's tools inside the platform itself to be useful, but the kind of granular control one gets from the pricey apps will still be out of reach, and everyone should expect strange hallucinations to be introduced into their edits from time to time. There are tons of photo editing apps available for your phone that can probably give you more control. But if you just want to boost the saturation of an image, this will probably do what you need. The integrations with Adobe Express and Acrobat may prove to be more handy for everyday folks, right now. 

Photoshop, Express, and Acrobat for ChatGPT are now available on desktop, web, and iOS. Android users only have access to Express at the moment, but support for Photoshop and Acrobat is coming soon.

It didn't take long for Josef Prusa to follow up his popular CORE One 3D printer with a beast of a machine: the CORE One L. This “large” printer with a 300 x 300 x 330 mm build volume is a major shift from Prusa Research's well-known i3 style. It still shares many of the same parts as the CORE One and MK4s, which will keep production costs down, but the CORE One L has a new AC-powered aluminum heat bed for even coverage and replaces a substantial amount of steel with lighter aluminum. This allows the CORE One L to have twice the print volume of the original machine while only taking up 10% more space.

It's unlikely the CORE One L will have a kit version, as the AC-powered heat bed is not for tinkerers. The 3D printer is still built with easy maintenance in mind and open source parts for lifetime repairability. The printer is also designed to operate completely offline if you choose, without dependence on the cloud for complete security. However, if you enjoy the convenience of mobile apps, the Prusa App offers remote printer operation, full access to Printables.com for model selection, and a lite version of PrusaSlicer for custom slicing on the go.

The CORE One L has a few clever tricks up its sleeve: it can flip the top vent open or close on its own, a flip of a switch makes loading (and running) TPU super easy, and strategically mounted fans control air flow and heat so the door can remain closed at all times. The chamber can hit 60 °C, making engineering-grade filaments as easy to run as PLA. It will also be the first 3D printer compatible with Prusa-backed OpenPrintTag, an open source initiative to create a universal “smart” spool with NFC tags that customers can reuse as they wish.

The CORE One L retails at $1,799 (including import duties and tariffs) and comes with 24/7 customer service and a complete ecosystem. This machine lives up to its reputation and is one of the best 3D printers we've tested to date.

The Prusa CORE One L comes 98% assembled. It includes a full set of tools and a full 1 kg spool of Galaxy Black Prusament PLA (plus a bag of Gummy Bears). There's also a USB stick with models to test out and a handbook on 3D printing with your new machine. The PrusaSlicer is available for free download from the website.

 




The CORE One L is at its heart a larger CORE One, with a few critical changes. The most obvious is the size, now sporting a 300 x 300 x 330 build volume, which is about twice the size by volume, if not exactly plate size.

 




The slim, all-steel exoskeleton now has aluminum walls to cut down on heft, which means the new printer checks in at about the same weight (48 pounds) as the smaller CORE. This keeps it still somewhat manageable to move by a single person and sit on a desk.

It has the same indents on either side to conceal the spool holder and customizable storage space, though now magnets will only stick to the frame. The door and upper parts of the side panels are translucent black polymer. The top panel snaps into place. The top vent can now be opened or closed by the printer itself. It's still not exactly airtight, with many gaps at the seams, but a few gaps in the frame won't spoil the system.

 




The exoskeleton provides a strong, stiff frame for the printer while also minimizing materials and avoiding the cheap plasticky feel we get from other brands. The indented sides reduce the interior space of the printer, making for less space to heat.

The biggest change to the CORE One L is the heat bed, which is now a solid chunk of aluminum, heated with AC power. It provides uniform heating from corner to corner, which is essential with such a large surface. There are two fans underneath the bed to distribute the heat like a convection oven. This eliminates the need for a second heating system, as the bed can now be used more efficiently to warm the entire chamber for technical filaments.

The CORE One L still shares many 3D parts with its Prusa siblings, which are produced at the large Prusa Research print farm in Prague (or in Delaware by Printed Solid if you buy one in America). CORE One 3D parts are made with PC Blend Carbon Fiber, printed on a combo of MK4s and CORE One machines. Prusa also does its own injection molding, which you can see on the LCD case.

 




Another thoughtful touch is the door hinge, which can be flipped if you rather have it open on the other side. The door can completely open 180 degrees, but Prusa encourages users to go ahead and keep it closed for any material, thanks to their active cooling system. The door has a sensor that will warn you to keep it shut and stop the print when the door is opened. This is a nice safety feature for schools, parents of small children, and pet owners. Thankfully, the sensor can be switched off if you want the freedom to poke your nose or a camera in there.

The CORE One L specs don't include acceleration rates, as the company is famous for putting quality over speed. The machine does come with a high flow nozzle, input shaping and factory tuned print profiles for over 200 filaments. Still, I opened up PrusaSlicer to see what kind of settings they're using for speed and acceleration. The top printing acceleration rate of 3000 mm/s² would not impress a Bambu user who easily has twice the speed. However, acceleration isn't everything. Using their default settings, both the CORE One L and the similarly sized Bambu Lab H2S printed a Maker's Muse calibration castle in about one hour and 15 minutes using .25mm layer height and default settings. Sure, the Bambu might be faster printing a big, plain box, but how often do you print things that are so boring?

 




The CORE One L finally has an onboard accelerometer, though it's completely factory calibrated and ready to print as soon as you plug it in. It also has an NFC antenna to make getting the machine online and connected to the Prusa app and slicer very easy. The app is entirely optional for those who wish to keep their printers offline. The CORE One L has a USB port for manually loading files, which is the printer's only place for file storage.

 




Like the CORE One, bed leveling is fully automatic, with no manual adjustments. First layers go down perfectly smooth thanks to a load cell sensor that has replaced the bedslinger's PINDA probe. The sensor is connected to the nozzle, which allows the CORE One L to physically tap the print surface for a more precise measurement. The sensor is also used to calculate Z Height, and it does it so well that there is no need for human intervention. Of course, there's still a live Z adjustment available in the menu should you need it. During testing, we did not.

 




The Prusa CORE One L comes nearly assembled. You just have to unpack it and remove a few screws that held the bed down during shipping. The screen arrives packed inside, attached to the front trim plate, and just needs to be slapped on the printer with magnets.

Our machine came with the optional filtration system, which did need more complex assembly. That involves removing the back panel to access the electronics, plugging the fans to the board and screwing everything back together. It was fairly straight forward, but I did have to hunt down the directions online.

 




Bed leveling is a no-brainer, as the Prusa CORE One L is fully automatic. There are no manual adjustments and no need to adjust the Z offset. The printer uses a load cell sensor connected to the nozzle, which physically taps the print surface for precise measurement.

The printer trams the bed and calculates the required z height before each print.

 




Loading filament is very simple. Simply place the spool into side mounted rack and feed the plastic into the reverse Bowden tube until it reaches the hotend. The printer will automatically detect it and pull it in the rest of the way. The screen will then ask what kind of material you're using to set the temperature. Once it gets hot enough, it will pull the filament into the hotend and ask if the color has changed. If it has, you can say yes and move on. If the answer is no, it will purge more material.

To remove material, go to the Filament menu from the main screen and click unload. It will remember what material was last installed, determine if the filament is still there, and then heat it to the appropriate temperature. Once hot, it will retract the plastic until you can easily remove it.

If you're running flexible filaments, there's a switch where the tube enters the chamber that allows you to switch off one of the filament sensors (another is on the tool head). This allows soft TPU to load as easily as PLA and I didn't have any trouble at all.

 




 




You'll need to download PrusaSlicer, which is free and open source. It is developed by Prusa Research and serves as the foundation for many other slicers. It comes with hundreds of profiles for every material and nozzle size that Prusa Research makes.

PrusaSlicer can also directly access Printables.com, which offers a wide selection of free file models for both fun and practical prints. If you're using the mobile app, files can be sent directly from Printables to the online EasyPrint slicer and then directly to your printer if you choose to have it online.

The CORE One L comes with a full 1 KG roll of Prusament PLA Galaxy Black. If you want more colors and materials like silks and multicolor filaments, you should check out our guide to the best filaments for 3D printing for suggestions.

We used the sample material to print a Benchy to see what the CORE One can do with its fastest default slicer settings. We used Speed Benchy rules for fairness: 2 walls, 3 top and bottom layers, 10% infill, a .25 layer height and .5 layer width. Using these settings, we got a very nice benchy in 23 minutes with a bit of wisps probably due to the humidity in the house.

 




I printed a few soap dishes I found on Printables for a practical PLA print. These were a little chonky looking despite the .2 layer height, due to the curves. It had 3 walls for strength printed in Prusament PLA Marble Grey, which makes home goods look more posh. It took 5 hours and 54 minutes to print three of them.

 




I also printed some cute clips, which mix practical with whimsical. These “Vicegriptor” locking clips have surprising bite when printed in PETG. A word of warning – you need to be very careful loosening them up the first time, or you risk breaking the print in place joints. Once they're limbered up, they work really nice for holding chip bags and the like.

I printed eight at a time on the CORE One L's roomy bed, taking 3 hours and 13 min, using a .2 layer height and default settings. This was printed in Greengate's recycled Deepwater Blue, a sparkly filament created for 3D Print Bunny.

 




For TPU I made another ill-fated dog toy for my Standard Poodle Ripley. The print was excellent, but 3D printed dog toys for strong chewers is still not that great. The filament loaded very easily, thanks to the new switch, and I had no trouble at all pushing it through to the Nextruder.

This printed in 6 hours and 6 minutes, using Inland Rainbow TPU and a .2mm layer height. It lasted about 6 hours after I gave it to the dog too. Before the dog destroyed it, it had very nice smooth and glossy surfaces and very slight blemishes from layer lines.

 




We ran a lot of high-temperature material from it, like this Fiberon Red PET-GF15 by Polymaker. This is a form of Polyethylene terephthalate, like PETG, but without the G (glycol), which is usually added to make the material behave. Instead, Polymaker added 15% glass fiber to make the PET stiff, dimensionally stable, and thermal resistant. It prints fast and super hot, and this needed 280 °C on the nozzle and 80 °C on the bed. I filled the bed with parts, and it printed very nicely without warping. There were some goobers on the edges that will brush off.

 




 




The CORE One L is a great addition to the Prusa lineup, filling a space between the “medium” MK4/CORE One and the Prusa XL tool changer. It gives you Prusa quality and security in a larger size without having the larger pro price tag. It has a retail price of $1,799 (including import duties and tariffs) and comes with 24/7 customer service and a complete ecosystem.

Its new aluminum bed with even AC-powered heating is excellent, and it has a few perks like the camera, TPU switch, and self-opening top vent that could be easily added to the smaller CORE One. It will also be the first printer to try out OpenSourceTag when it hits the market.

We're also keeping our fingers crossed for a tool changer mod through a partnership with Bondtech, but details are still vague as of this writing.

If a Prusa CORE One L seems just a bit too spendy for your budget, the smaller Prusa CORE One comes in at $999 for a kit. The delightfully budget-friendly Bambu Lab P1S Combo is currently on sale for $549, and if you need some massive CORE XY size, the Creality K2 Plus is worth checking out at $1199.

Officials meet Alibaba, ByteDance, and Tencent to assess demand for the H200. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


China convened emergency meetings with its largest technology companies on Wednesday, December 10, to assess how many of Nvidia's H200 accelerators they intend to buy, following President Donald Trump's decision to allow exports of the chip to ""approved customers"" in the country. Representatives from Alibaba, ByteDance, and Tencent were asked to provide demand forecasts for the H200, according to reporting by The Information, as regulators consider whether to permit purchases and how to structure potential limits on the hardware.

According to the report, he meetings were led by the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Both agencies have overseen AI chip procurement since the first round of controls took effect back in 2022, and both are now attempting to balance two conflicting pressures: China does not currently produce a domestic equivalent to the H200 for large-scale training workloads, yet the government continues to press companies to adopt homegrown silicon whenever possible. Officials requested estimates of each company's H200 requirements earlier in the week and told attendees they would issue guidance once responses are reviewed.

The H200 sits one generation below Nvidia's new Blackwell platform but remains vastly more capable than the export-compliant H20 that was built specifically for the Chinese market. The H20 contributed just $50 million in revenue during Nvidia's October quarter, compared to $4.6 billion in the period earlier this year when the company could still ship H100-class processors into China. Nvidia's overall China revenue fell 63% year over year to about $3 billion in the same quarter. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has since said that Nvidia has virtually no market share left in China.

Trump's approval of H200 exports follows a meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and introduces a new mechanism for moving high-end GPUs into China. Chips manufactured by TSMC in Taiwan would be imported into the United States for security reviews, taxed at 25% and then re-exported to approved Chinese buyers. U.S. officials told The Information that the arrangement was designed as a middle ground whereby Blackwell remains off-limits, but a complete ban on H200 shipments was viewed as likely to accelerate China's domestic chip development.

Chinese regulators, meanwhile, are considering restrictions of their own. One proposal would cap the amount of Nvidia hardware a company can buy relative to its existing and planned purchases of domestic accelerators. Another would bar H200 use in sectors regarded as strategically sensitive, including finance and energy. If adopted, these measures would be communicated through informal “window guidance”, the same method authorities used earlier this year when they urged companies to avoid Nvidia hardware and prioritize suppliers such as Huawei.

If Beijing authorizes H200 imports, demand is expected to be substantial. Companies are said to have begun preliminary discussions with Nvidia about potential orders after Bloomberg first reported in November that the U.S. was weighing approval, and, according to Reuters, the likes of Alibaba and ByteDance are said to be “keen” to begin purchasing Nvidia's chips. For now, China's policymakers are attempting to determine how to meet short-term AI training needs without undermining the long-term push for semiconductor self-reliance

A sonic boom worthy of Guile himself.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Besides having already eaten most sorts of chip production, AI is quickly coming for power sources. Gas turbines are seeing increased demand, and companies like xAI are using tens of units to power their data centers. Now, Boom, known for its supersonic airliner project, has revealed the Superpower turbine with a bang, a new project that will repurpose its aircraft engine tech to power AI data centers.

The Superpower turbine is purportedly ""optimized for AI datacenters,"" a claim boiled down to delivering its full 42 MW with 39% efficiency, at an operating temperature up to a toasty 110° F (43° C). Judging by a quick search, that's significantly higher than contemporary designs, whose output drops at around 86° F (30° C), if not much sooner—and precisely when it's most needed, when servers are working the hardest.

Almost as importantly, Boom claims the new design is ""waterless"", a fact that should somewhat assuage ever-growing concerns about datacenters' water usage. Although the servers' cooling towers still need water to function, the fact that it would no longer be necessary to cool the turbines would definitely be a bonus.

Boom says it's taken an order for its new design from Crusoe AI for a substantial 1.21 GW of turbines. The company says it builds everything in Denver, Colorado, and that it intends to create a Superfactory for this new enterprise. Boom expects to deliver 200 MW worth of turbines by 2027, 1 GW in 2028, and up to a meaty 2 GW come 2029. Crusoe ordered 29 units, and the first of them ought to be delivered in 2027.

According to Boom's Blake Scholl, the idea came about due to the fact that xAI and OpenAI both are using converted jet engines, whose main limitation is twofold: commercial availability and falling output at high ambient temperatures, as they're designed for high-altitude operation. The Superpower turbine design is derived from the company's existing Symphony airspace-targeted turbine.

According to Boom, the Symphony engine is designed to power supersonic flight at speeds of up to Mach 1.7 at 60,000 feet. Superpower will run on natural gas, rather than jet fuel, of course. While news of a Concorde successor pivoting its tech to AI might give aviation fans pause, Boom says the new project will actually boost its core mission. ""The fastest way to a certified, passenger-carrying Symphony engine is to run its core for hundreds of thousands of hours in the real world, powering Earth's most demanding AI data centers,"" Boom says.

Turns out these supersonic jet-powered AI data centers will actually serve as a giant test bed for Boom's turbines. Naturally a profitable venture, Boom also says that the profitability from Superpower will fund ""the remainder of the aircraft program,"" creating a self-sustaining path to supersonic flight.

It can be argued that the long-term future for energy generation is nuclear and with more renewables. The AI train stops for nobody, though, so having better local power generation options now, with rising power costs and stressed grids, is as good a stopgap as any.

Can CUDA still capture China?

The U.S. can now export Nvidia's H200 AI accelerator to China, with a 25% fee attached. However, following the authorization of the chips, a new report suggests that the decision was made to ensure American tech dominance globally. Reportedly, a major part of the decision is Huawei's recent advancements with its CloudMatrix 384 and Ascend 910C systems, which are on par with both the H200 and Nvidia's GB200 NVL72, a new Bloomberg report suggests.

This decision would enable China to continue to access Nvidia's CUDA-based AI accelerators, as many AI systems still rely on that particular software stack. While China is attempting to standardize an instruction set of its own, the open-source CANN, it has been noted that Nvidia chips are preferable for companies such as Deepseek for training advanced AI models.

According to sources speaking to Bloomberg, multiple scenarios were considered, including flooding the market to ""overwhelm"" Huawei, to exporting no AI accelerators, which would mark a dramatic shift, if the previously-approved Nvidia H20 (a cut-down H200) were to be affected. Ultimately, the decision rests somewhere in the middle.

China won't get access to Nvidia's latest Blackwell architectures, but it will retain access to the full-fat H200. The White House likely hopes that this move keeps the latest Nvidia chips, while also keeping the country locked into Nvidia's carefully crafted CUDA-shaped moat. ""The Trump administration is committed to ensuring the dominance of the American tech stack - without compromising on national security"", said White House spokesman Kush Desai, in a statement to Bloomberg.

White House officials are reported to have reviewed the performance of Huawei's AI accelerator ecosystem, in particular, the CloudMatrix 384 system, which utilizes 384 Ascend 910C chips. The CloudMatrix 384 is positioned directly against Nvidia's (export-controlled) GB200 platform, but with obvious tradeoffs in performance and efficiency.

 




While Bloomberg notes recent rumblings that Huawei is preparing to up its 910C chip production to 600,000 units next year, the report claims U.S. officials concluded ""that Huawei would be capable in 2026 of producing a few million of its Ascend 910C accelerators,"" according to the insider.

The AI race is now bound by pure performance, and the Trump Administration clearly hopes that retaining its architectural advantage by restricting Blackwell will keep Western frontier AI models at the forefront of the industry.

Just last week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang commented that he would be uncertain whether or not Chinese companies would even end up purchasing the H200. Huang has long since been a vocal detractor against export controls of AI GPUs, as Nvidia wrote off $5.5 billion in AI chips in April 2025. Whether or not the availability of H200 systems on the Chinese market will be enough to recover the shortfall remains to be seen.

This combo deal costs less than the RAM if bought alone!


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


With DDR5 prices still out of this world and no relief in sight (Micron lopping off Crucial does not help), finding combo deals is one of the few ways to upgrade to the latest and greatest platforms without emptying your bank account. Newegg is currently offering a heck of a deal on a new Z890-based motherboard and RAM. For $649.99, you get a mid-range Gigabyte Z890 Aorus Elite Wi-Fi 7 motherboard with 32GB (2x16GB) of GSkill Trident Z5 DDR5-6000 CL36 RGB RAM. On top of that, they're throwing in a 360mm Cooler Master and Star Wars Outlaws PC game. Considering that the RAM alone is priced at $689.99, AND you get a free AIO and PC game, this is one of the best combo deals we've seen since Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

On top of current and future CPU support, the Z890 Aorus Elite Wifi7 is a well-rounded motherboard with four M.2 sockets (one PCIe 5.0) and four SATA ports for storage, fast networking with integrated Wi-Fi 7 and 2.5 GbE, and enough USB ports (eight Type-A, one Type-C) to go around. The audio solution is also solid, using a last-gen flagship (ALC1220). The Aorus Elite's black aesthetic and RGB lighting zones give off a premium vibe and are sure to look good with any dark or black build theme, especially with the matching black GSkill RAM that has its own RGB lighting.

This incredible combo deal gets you into the latest Intel Z890 platform with a quality motherboard, 32GB of RAM a 360mm AIO and a free Star Wars Outlaws game for $649.99.

GSkill's Trident Z RAM (F5-6000J3636F32GX2-TZ5RK), is the pièce de résistance out of this combo. the 32GB (2x16GB) DDR5-6000 kit runs at 36-36-36-96 timings at 1.35V. It's not the fastest or tightest timings, but let's be honest, you likely won't notice the difference, and beggars can't be choosers. Intel systems have a lot more headroom than Intel, but we're confident you'd be happy with the system's performance using it. Under the black, RGB-laden heatspreaders are (typically) Samsung IC. If these speeds aren't fast enough for you, there's room to increase speed, lower timings, or both.

Newegg also throws in a Cooler Master 360 Elite AIO ($70.07 on Amazon) to sweeten the already incredible deal. The AIO uses three 120mm RGB fans (up to 2,100RPM) and is said to run cool and quiet. Cooler master doesn't seem to list TDP support, but we know this will handle just about any CPU you use under it.

At under $650, this is one of the best active deals we've found that includes 32GB of DDR5 RAM at a reasonable speed. And while you can get away with 16GB and slower speeds, the former is not optimal, and you'd run into a wall sooner than later at that capacity. If you bought all of this individually, you'd be looking at almost $1,130 with the included AIO and game. Priced at $649.99 ($279.99/30% off), now is the time to jump on this deal, as they will get more difficult to find as time goes on.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:medicalnewstoday.com","What dietary choices can help prevent diabetes? Latest research","https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/type-2-diabetes-latest-research-diet-risk-prevention","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 06:46:46 GMT","

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 11.6% (38.4 million people) of the United States' population had diabetes, as of 2021. 

Diabetes is a growing issue and concern in the U.S. Research from 2024 found that the rate of diabetes increased by 18.6% in a decade. 

Various recent studies and reviews have found that individual dietary patterns can influence a person's risk of developing type 2 diabetes, which is the most common form of diabetes.

Here is what the studies that Medical News Today covered in 2025 have to say about how certain dietary patterns can lower the risk of diabetes.

A meta-analysis presented at the 2025 Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) found that following any of these three diets can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes: 

According to the meta-analysis, the greatest diabetes reduction risk was 23% and was seen in those closely following the DASH diet. The AHEI diet saw a 21% reduction, and the Mediterranean diet saw a 17% risk reduction.

The Mediterranean diet may be the most well-known of the three diets. However, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is fairly similar. It helps people to focus on reducing their sodium intake and increasing their consumption of calcium, magnesium, and potassium. 

Michelle Routhstein, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN, a preventive cardiology dietitian and heart health expert at Entirely Nourished, not involved in this research, explained what the AHEI diet is: 

“The AHEI (Alternative Healthy Eating Index) diet is a research-based scoring system developed to assess diet quality based on how well it aligns with dietary patterns that have been shown to lower chronic disease risk. It encourages high consumption of fiber-dense foods like vegetables, whole fruits excluding juice, whole grains, nuts, legumes; healthy fats like polyunsaturated fats, and lean proteins, specifically fish and poultry. It limits red and processed meats, refined grains, sodium, and sugar-sweetened beverages.”

Jason Ng, MD, a professor of endocrinology and metabolism in the Department of Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, told Medical News Today that all three diets share some underlying concepts. 

They all “contain the common theme of focusing on healthy fats, more plant-based foods like vegetables and fruits, and staying away from processed foods and keeping away from high sugar and added sugars to foods, which are all cornerstones of type 2 diabetes management,” said Ng, who was also not involved in the research.

A review of recent research that was published in Frontiers in Nutrition also found that the DASH diet can help reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes related complications, such as: 

Thomas M. Holland, MD, a physician-scientist and assistant professor at the RUSH Institute for Healthy Aging, RUSH University, College of Health Sciences, who was not involved in the review, told MNT:

“These findings are important because they show that the DASH diet, which was originally designed to lower blood pressure, also improves several of the biological pathways that drive complications in type 2 diabetes. Scientifically, the diet's mix of high potassium, magnesium, calcium, fiber, and healthy fats, along with low sodium, added sugars, and saturated fat, reduces vascular stiffness, calms inflammation, and supports healthier kidney filtration and blood vessel function. This means the DASH diet helps protect the organs that diabetes tends to wear down over time, especially the heart, kidneys, eyes, and blood vessels.”

The DASH diet was originally developed to prevent and manage hypertension (high blood pressure). However, researchers have found that along with lower blood pressure, the diet can have various other benefits for those with type 2 diabetes. 

“The DASH findings are valuable and reinforce what we've long recognized in metabolic medicine: Structured daily nutrition patterns can meaningfully improve the pathways that drive diabetes complications, from blood pressure and kidney function to lipids and inflammation,“ William Hsu, MD, Head of the Diabetes Regression and Remission Program and Chief Medical Officer at L-Nutra Health, not involved in this study, also told MNT.

Hsu added that it is not whether the DASH diet works, but whether people can sustain it. Individuals with type 2 diabetes can discuss the DASH diet with their healthcare professional or a dietitian. 

A recent review published in Nutrients discussed some benefits of drinking coffee, as well as how it can decrease mortality risk and the risk for several conditions. 

The review explains that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) generally considers coffee healthy when it has fewer than 5 calories. 

The review notes that many cohort studies show that drinking coffee may be linked to decreased mortality rates. One 2012 study found that drinking at least 2 cups of coffee a day was linked with a 10–15% lower risk of overall mortality. 

The review also found that drinking three to five cups of coffee daily may decrease the risk for cardiovascular disease by around 15%. It may also decrease the risk for chronic respiratory problems and respiratory disease mortality. 

Coffee may decrease the risk for type 2 diabetes, and this likely applies to decaf and regular coffee. For people with diabetes, one meta-analysis found that coffee may decrease risk for cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and overall mortality.

Review author Farin Kamangar, MD, highlighted the main findings:

“The results of several decades of high-quality research on millions of people, show that coffee is overall beneficial to health. Moderate coffee consumption, typically 3 to 5 cups a day, is linked to increased longevity and reduced risks of many major diseases, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, respiratory illnesses, and cognitive decline.”

A major study has shown that a healthy, plant-rich diet may reduce the risk of developing both type 2 diabetes and heart disease. 

The study findings that were presented at NUTRITION 2025, the annual flagship meeting of the American Society for Nutrition, suggested that eating a diet high in phytosterols can reduce the risk of heart disease by 9% and type 2 diabetes by 8%.

The findings of this study have yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. 

Eamon Laird, PhD, assistant lecturer in nutritional science at Atlantic Technological University (ATU) Sligo & Visiting Adjunct Professor Trinity College Dublin, who was not involved in the study, told us that “these are highly significant — if the findings are true then it could lead to an effective measure of significantly reducing the risk of these conditions along with reducing healthcare costs and improving patient quality of life with an easy non-medical method from diet.“

“However, before we get too excited, I would like to see a lot more of the methods here — what was the population they looked at, what measures and methods were used, and what statistical techniques were employed,” Laird cautioned.

Researchers carrying out the observational study analyzed data from more than 200,000 adults in the U.S. Those in the highest group consumed around 4 to 5 servings of vegetables, 2 to 3 servings of fruit, two servings of whole grains, and half a serving of nuts per day.

People in the top fifth for phytosterol intake were 9% less likely to develop heart disease and 8% less likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those in the bottom group.

Phytosterols may be beneficial to health because they are found in many plant foods, and comprise two types of bioactive compounds: plant sterols and plant stanols.

Fenglei Wang, PhD, research associate at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who presented the research, explained:

“Our clinical biomarker and metabolomic results suggest the involvement of insulin activity, inflammation, and the metabolism of metabolites associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This suggests that phytosterol might reduce risk by alleviating insulin resistance and inflammation.”

By interfering with the absorption of dietary cholesterol, phytosterols may also help lower levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or ‘bad' cholesterol in the blood, a major risk factor for heart disease.

It can be difficult to get enough phytosterols to lower cholesterol through diet alone. Certain foods, such as unrefined oils, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and legumes, may have some of the highest concentrations, however. 

They can also typically be taken as a supplement. However, it is important to remember that phytosterols should not take the place of cholesterol-lowering medications.

Several triggers, such as consultations for malignancy and heart failure, noted in electronic health records (EHRs) of older adults were associated with mortality. The initiation of advance care planning often occurred close to or even earlier than the optimal timing windows.

""GPs can use the triggers identified in the EHR in an automated computer search to prioritise patients for ACP [advance care planning]. They may prioritise ACP in patients with multiple triggers present in their EHR, particularly those more present in deceased patients and with closest proximity to the optimal ACP timing window,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Willemijn Tros, Public Health and Primary Care, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands. It was published online on November 29, 2025, in BMJ Open.

The end-of-life communication was used as a reference for advance care planning and may not have fully captured its broader scope. The reliance on routine EHRs may have resulted in underreporting or missing data. The mean age of the cohort was around 80 years, and its urban-rural composition may have limited generalisability to other older populations.

This study was supported by a European Research Council Consolidator grant and Leiden University Medical Center. No relevant conflicts of interest were disclosed by the authors.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Clinical notes aren't just paperwork. They are structured to communicate efficiently. That's why most notes follow the SOAP format: subjective, objective, assessment, and plan.

Subjective is the patient story: symptoms, concerns, and history, in their own words. Objective includes measurable data: vitals, labs, and exam findings.

Assessment is your clinical reasoning: what you think is going on, including differential diagnoses. Plan details your next steps: medications, tests, follow-ups, and consults.

This SOAP order isn't arbitrary. It really mirrors a logical flow of clinical reasoning, ensuring that anyone reading your note can understand the patient's story or thought process and your intended actions.

These SOAP notes actually improve clarity, continuity of care, and patient safety.

Intestinal ultrasound (IUS) was a preferred method for monitoring inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a higher percentage of US patients who had undergone the procedure than colonoscopy, but a larger portion found colonoscopy useful than found IUS useful.

“IUS is highly acceptable, well tolerated, and preferred by our US population. These findings support the implementation of IUS as a patient-centric monitoring tool,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study, led by Emily Gore, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, The Mount Sinai Hospital, New York City, was published online in Digestive Diseases and Sciences.

The study's limitations included generally high rates of patient engagement and reported medication adherence, as well as anecdotally high baseline health literacy. Patient engagement and overall experience with IUS may vary depending on the provider performing the exam. The study did not assess clinical outcomes or the cost-effectiveness of IUS as a monitoring tool.

No funding was received for conducting the study. The authors declared having no relevant conflicts of interest.

Emergency department (ED) visits for cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) increased from 4.36 to 22.33 per 100,000 visits between 2016 and 2022, peaking at 33.06 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""This cross-sectional study found that nationally representative ED data indicated a sustained rise in CHS-related visits from 2016 to 2022, especially among young adults. CHS now accounts for a growing share of emesis-related ED presentations,"" the authors wrote. 

""There remains a need for education to enhance early recognition, coupled with improved reporting and tracking, particularly given the new ICD-10 coding. Efforts should also promote evidence-based interventions over traditional antiemetics,"" the authors of an invited commentary wrote.

The study was led by James A. Swartz, PhD, Jane Addams College of Social Work, University of Illinois Chicago. It was published online on November 24, 2025, in JAMA Network Open.

The absence of a specific International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision code for CHS during the study period necessitated the use of proxy definitions, which increased the risk for misclassification. Case identification was complicated by underreporting of cannabis use and symptom overlap with other conditions. The requirement for CVS as a primary diagnosis may have led to underestimation of case counts. The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample captured visits rather than individual patients, which could have inflated counts due to repeat visits. Additionally, race and ethnicity data were available only for 2019-2022, limiting certain trend analyses.

Vaccine rates are in decline across Australia, leading to record-high infection rates for preventable diseases such as measles, whooping cough, and influenza.

A report by the Australian Medical Association (AMA) called “From Coverage to Concern: A Policy Analysis of Australia's Immunisation Decline” paints a troubling picture of the state of immunization. Vaccination rates have been steadily falling for people of all ages since 2020, with vaccine coverage in children aged 5 years dropping to 93% this year.

“The report confirmed our suspicions that across all of our immunization programs…we're seeing a really concerning downturn in participation,” Danielle McMullen, MBBS, president of the AMA and a general practitioner (GP) in Queensland, told Medscape News Australia.

Measles is a very contagious illness that requires a high degree of immunity to reduce the risk for outbreaks and deaths. But vaccination rates in children are falling, and there were 158 cases of measles this year, which is at least 100 more than last year.

“Some areas of Queensland were well below what we need for herd immunity, which means that all it will take is one or two travelers returning home, and we could well have a significant measles outbreak on our hands,” said McMullen. In Queensland's Gold Coast, for instance, only 76% of 2-year-olds were vaccinated against measles in 2024, which is a significant drop from the 82% coverage recorded in 2021.

“It's also really disappointing to see…the downturn in HPV [human papillomavirus] vaccination,” said McMullen. “The HPV vaccine was an Australian invention and could turn the tide on cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers.”

Australia was on track to eliminate HPV-related cervical cancer by 2035. But HPV vaccination rates have dropped 5.5% for girls and 7% for boys since 2020. They are now well below the 90% target rate.

“We are really disappointed by these statistics, and it highlights how urgent the need is for governments and health providers to be working together to combat misinformation, make sure patients have a safe space to discuss their questions, and make sure that we get back to being world leaders in immunization,” said McMullen.

According to the AMA's report, influenza infection rates have reached their highest level in almost a quarter of a century after the rate of childhood vaccinations fell from 46% to 28% between 2020 and 2024.

There were more than 57,000 cases of whooping cough and almost 176,000 cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 2024. These are the highest numbers since 1991 and 2021, respectively. Many cases of RSV are in young children, for whom it is a serious illness.

The COVID vaccine booster is recommended every 6 months for people aged 75 years or older because the disease remains a significant cause of illness and death in this group. But only 32% received a booster in the 6 months before September.

“We're already seeing hospitals operating beyond their capacity,” said McMullen. “Now is not the time to let more infectious diseases…back into the community.”

Australia's declining vaccination rates result in part from pandemic-related vaccine fatigue. “People are just sick and tired of immunizations and don't want to think about it anymore,” said McMullen. “With the cost-of-living crisis and the busy world we live in now, people do also find it harder for people to fit in immunizations.

“The COVID pandemic was a once-in-a-lifetime, terrible event…and a lot of people have anger about the pandemic, and this has been taken out on anything to do with public health. That, unfortunately, includes vaccines,” Raina MacIntyre, MBBS, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, told Medscape News Australia.

Spreading misinformation about vaccines globally and instantaneously, social media has led to falling immunization rates all over the world, said MacIntyre. “It's time we started countering that in a more effective way. But unfortunately, that requires tracking of disinformation, and we're just playing catch-up.”

The AMA is calling on the government to boost vaccination rates by giving extra resources to general practices. “GPs have been real stewards of our immunization programs, coordinating the recalls and reminders and chasing up patients who haven't been immunized,” said McMullen.

Policy changes, including the introduction of pharmacy vaccinations, have made GPs “less sure about whose job is it to be watching who's been immunized and who hasn't,” said McMullen. “We would like to see governments support general practice as the core of our national immunization programs and obviously appropriately support them to do that coordinating.”

Australia doesn't have to reinvent the wheel to lift vaccination rates; the federal government's Seven-Point Plan, which raised vaccination rates for 1-year-olds from 52% in 1995 to 95% by 2020 by providing financial incentives to GPs and parents, would also be effective today, Rodney Pearce, MBBS, a GP based in South Australia and the chair of the not-for-profit Immunisation Coalition, told Medscape News Australia.

From 1998, GPs received $18.50 for each child who was vaccinated, regardless of whether the vaccines were administered by the GP or another provider. GP clinics also received a bonus payment for hitting vaccine coverage goals across their patient cohorts. This policy provided a financial reward for tracking down and integrating vaccine data and helped fund vaccine fridges and nursing staff, said Pearce.

Between 2008 and 2013, these incentive payments were gradually scrapped. Now, “there's nothing that rewards everyone to work together and focus on getting vaccination rates up,” said Pearce.

McMullen reported having no relevant financial relationships. Raina MacIntyre reported being on the advisory boards of several vaccine manufacturers, including GSK and Moderna. She recently published a book on vaccine hesitancy called Vaccine Nation. Pearce reported being the chair of the Immunisation Coalition, which receives funding from pharmaceutical companies for its editorially independent podcasts.

In patients with persistently positive antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies, both a history of thrombosis and hematologic disease (autoimmune hemolytic anemia and/or thrombocytopenia) independently conferred an approximately twofold increased risk for incident thrombosis. 

“History of thrombosis is already widely regarded to be a significant risk factor for future thrombosis, not only among aPL-positive individuals but also in the general population,” the authors wrote.

“The finding that aPL-associated haematologic disease confers increased risk for thrombosis among aPL-positive patients is novel,” they added.

The study was led by Jonathan Thaler, MD, Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City. It was published online on November 19, 2025, in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases.

The number of patients with at least one thrombotic event was small. The retrospective nature of baseline data collection may have introduced potential bias. Additionally, reliance on investigator-reported causes of death may have affected the accuracy of outcome classification.

This study did not receive any specific grant. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Contaminated lettuce in pre-packaged supermarket sandwiches was the likely source of the UK's largest recorded outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O145, according to a new report from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).

The outbreak was declared on 24 May 2024 after a rapid rise in STEC cases detected through routine surveillance. Between May and November 2024, 293 cases were confirmed. Almost half of the patients were admitted to hospital, and 11 developed complications, including haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Two deaths were reported.

The same STEC O145 strain had caused a smaller outbreak of 44 cases between June and October 2023.

Epidemiological analysis linked cases to products from three large sandwich manufacturers. UK-grown Apollo lettuce was identified as the likely contaminated ingredient. Bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwiches and chicken salad sandwiches were the most frequently reported items.

All three manufacturers carried out a voluntary precautionary recall.

Amy Douglas, lead epidemiologist at UKHSA, said STEC O145 was a “growing threat” and had become one of the most common STEC types detected.

STEC infections rose sharply in England in 2024. UKHSA data showed 2544 culture-confirmed cases: 564 for STEC O157 and 1980 for non-O157 STEC. This was a 26.1% increase on the 2018 cases reported in 2023.

Cattle are the main reservoir for STEC, although other ruminants — including sheep, goats, and deer — also carry the pathogen. Transmission can occur through direct or indirect contact with animals or their faeces, contaminated food or water, or person-to-person spread.

Five outbreaks of non-0157 STEC were investigated in 2024. Sources were identified in three: suspected beef, suspected fresh fruit, and salad leaves, likely Apollo lettuce.

Douglas said outbreaks linked to fresh produce and ready-to-eat foods were difficult to investigate due to their speed and the volume of cases.

“By the time we are made aware of an outbreak, often none of the implicated food products are available for testing because they have either been eaten or disposed of, making it difficult to confirm whether they were contaminated,” she said.

The 2024 outbreak surpassed the 2022 STEC O157 incident and, with 293 confirmed cases, is now the largest reported STEC outbreak in the UK since routine whole-genome sequencing began in 2015. It is also the largest O145 outbreak ever recorded in the UK, the agency said.

As the investigation did not establish the contamination source, the report warned that further cases involving the same strain could not be ruled out.

The UKHSA made seven recommendations to mitigate future risk. These included strengthened cooperation and multidisciplinary collaboration between agencies and authorities and improving awareness of the risks associated with STEC.

Minor ailments were common in older adults, often lasting beyond 2 weeks, and many were managed with over-the-counter drugs or a wait-and-see approach.

“Healthcare providers should continue to recognize minor ailments as an integral aspect of geriatric care,” the authors of the study wrote. 

This study was led by Jeffrey Taylor of the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. It was published online on December 1, 2025, in Journal of Primary Care & Community Health.

Symptoms were self-reported by the participants without clinical verification. Findings reflected a single timepoint in late fall and early winter when certain allergies were less common.

This study received funding from the Canadian Foundation for Pharmacy, the Canadian Hub for Applied Social Research, and the University of Saskatchewan. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Sexual violence against children and intimate partner violence against women are two of the most devastating yet persistently underrecognized global health challenges and rank among the top risks for mortality and morbidity worldwide, according to research published in The Lancet today.

For the first time, researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington School of Medicine comprehensively mapped the broad spectrum of health outcomes linked to sexual violence against children (SVAC) and intimate partner violence (IPV) among females in 204 countries and territories. The new analysis is part of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2023 study that provides refined prevalence estimates and reveals an attributable disease burden far greater than previously understood.

These findings fundamentally challenge the persistent view of SVAC and IPV as primarily social or criminal justice issues and underscore their status as major public health priorities.""

Dr. Luisa Sorio Flor, lead author and assistant professor at IHME

Researchers incorporated new evidence into the GBD 2023 study, showing SVAC and IPV are linked to a wider spectrum of health outcomes than previously recognized and resulting in significantly greater estimates of health loss. SVAC was linked to 14 conditions, while IPV was associated with eight negative health outcomes.

""By expanding the recognized adverse health outcomes linked to sexual and physical violence, we are deepening our understanding of a crisis that has remained in the shadows,"" said Dr. Flor. ""The burden is staggering-and has been systematically overlooked in global health priorities.""

In 2023, over 1 billion people aged 15 and older were estimated to have experienced sexual assault during childhood, and 608 million girls and women in this age group have ever endured physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner. These exposures together contributed to more than 50 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) globally-32.2 million from SVAC and 18.5 million from IPV. DALYs represent the total years of healthy life lost due to both premature mortality and years lived with disability.

These risks were shown to be especially devasting for young and middle-aged individuals. Among women aged 15-49 years, IPV and SVAC ranked as the fourth and fifth leading risk factors for loss of healthy life globally, outranking many well-known threats such as high fasting plasma glucose or elevated blood pressure, and close in ranking to iron deficiency (ranked second), a longstanding focus of women's health interventions.

""Most other conditions affecting a billion people and ranking in the top five health threats dominate the global health agenda,"" said co-author of the study Professor Emmanuela Gakidou, from IHME. ""These findings make the case irrefutable: violence is not simply a social problem that occasionally impacts health, it is a leading cause of death and disability demanding comprehensive public health action.""

For men, SVAC ranked 11th among all health risks. In the GBD high-income region, which includes countries in Europe, Latin America, North America, and Oceania, SVAC's contribution to health loss ranked fourth overall, comparable to the disease burden imposed by smoking (ranked fifth), a risk factor that has experienced substantial declines in recent decades as a result of comprehensive, evidence-based control measures, strong policy commitments, and coordinated global action.

In 2023, SVAC was associated with 290,000 deaths worldwide, predominantly from suicide, HIV/AIDS, and type 2 diabetes. Among SVAC's 14 negative health outcomes, mental health disorders-especially anxiety among women and schizophrenia among men-contributed most to lost healthy years, alongside self-harm, notably in South Asia. Substance use disorders were also significant, especially among males in high-income locations.

IPV accounted for over 20% of healthy life lost to anxiety and self-harm among women and was linked to 145,000 deaths, mostly from homicide, suicide, and HIV/AIDS. Alarmingly, the authors estimated that nearly 30,000 women were killed by their partners in 2023 alone, highlighting an urgent need for enhanced protection for at-risk individuals. Of the eight health outcomes associated with IPV, anxiety and major depressive disorder were the largest contributors to this overall burden, measured in DALYs, for women across most world regions, except in sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV/AIDS was predominant.

""Given the wide range of health conditions associated with SVAC and IPV, survivors will continue to require both immediate and long-term care from health systems worldwide,"" explained Dr. Flor. ""Violence prevention is not enough: we must also identify, protect, rehabilitate, and support survivors, and the health sector is central to these efforts.""

The study highlights the fact that violence is preventable through effective interventions such as comprehensive legislation and enforcement, trauma-informed health care, school-based prevention, community engagement, economic empowerment, and coordinated action across sectors. Despite methodological advances, IPV and SVAC occurrence, as well as their associated impacts, are likely still underestimated due to stigma and underreporting.

""Rigorous data like this bring long-overdue clarity to the scale and consequences of violence experienced by women and children,"" says Dr. Anita Zaidi, Gender Equality President, Gates Foundation. ""The evidence is unmistakable: these harms are far more pervasive and far more damaging to health than previously understood, and they demand immediate action from country leaders. This analysis shows exactly where the needs are greatest. Acting on it is essential to break cycles of trauma that carry forward for generations.""

Doctors treating seriously ill patients in an emergency setting may want to give the sedative etomidate, rather than ketamine, while placing a breathing tube, according to a randomized trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The Randomized Trial of Sedative Choice for Intubation (RSI) is the first multicenter trial to demonstrate significant cardiovascular risks of high doses of ketamine (low blood pressure, arrhythmia), side effects that have not been well studied in the past.

We know that patients receive treatments every day in hospitals around the world that have never been evaluated in a rigorous study and may be ineffective or even harmful.""

Jonathan Casey, MD, lead author, associate professor of Medicine, Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center

""Studies like RSI are critically important to understand the treatments that patients are already receiving and to ensure that patients receive the treatments that will result in the best outcomes,"" he said.

Casey co-led the trial with Matthew Semler, MD, MSCI, associate professor of Medicine in the Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at VUMC, along with a team of patients, clinicians and researchers from six cities across the U.S.

The RSI trial compared the use of ketamine and etomidate during tracheal intubation of 2,365 patients in 14 emergency departments and intensive care units in the U.S. The trial found that etomidate is safe to use, meaning it did not increase the risk of death, and that etomidate significantly decreased the risk of dangerously low blood pressures during the procedure, compared with ketamine.

""These two medicines, ketamine and etomidate, were approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) before I was born,"" Semler said. ""For more than 40 years, they've been administered to millions of critically ill adults each year. Yet, our RSI trial is the first large, multicenter trial to examine which of the two medicines results in best outcomes for patients.

""We found that etomidate is safe and that ketamine can cause severely low blood pressure during intubation. Going forward, many clinicians will choose to use etomidate rather than ketamine. These findings emphasize why more research must focus not just on the development of new drugs and devices, but also on understanding which treatments patients are already receiving produce the best outcomes,"" he said.

Historically, etomidate was the more commonly used sedative, but it was found to impair production of cortisol, which raised concerns that it could increase the risk of death following intubation. Based on these concerns, some countries removed etomidate from the market.

In many settings, ketamine replaced etomidate as the primary sedative during emergency tracheal intubation. This has been part of a movement by clinicians and patients to use ketamine for an increasing number of problems, including acute and chronic pain, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, despite limited data on its effectiveness and safety. The potential risks of ketamine were brought to public attention in 2023 when the drug was thought to be a cause of ""Friends"" actor Matthew Perry's death.

Casey said that the results of the RSI trial, showing that etomidate does not increase the risk of death and causes less hypotension than ketamine, may convince countries that had removed etomidate from the market to make it available again. Coinciding with the paper's release, the RSI trial was presented at the Critical Care Reviews conference in Melbourne, Australia - one of the countries in which etomidate has been removed from the market.

For next steps, the researchers are evaluating the effect of sedative medications on long-term patient-centered outcomes like symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder at 12 months. 

They are also conducting the INSPIRE trial, evaluating the use of the neuromuscular relaxing medications that are given along with a sedative during emergency tracheal intubation to relax patient's muscles for breathing tube placement. 

""Whether the benefit of giving neuromuscular relaxing medication outweighs the risk remains unknown and is important to evaluate in a rigorous study,"" Casey said.

Finally, VUMC is also leading a large, multicenter randomized trial (BREATHE) that seeks to understand whether using a smaller size of breathing tube can prevent injury to patients' vocal cords and long-term problems with breathing, speaking and swallowing.

The RSI trial was funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute ( grant BPS-2024C1-37478) and the National Institutes of Health (grant K23HL153584).

 EpilepsyGTx, a biotechnology company focused on research and development of cutting-edge gene therapies to treat refractory epilepsy, today announced it has raised $33 million in a Series A financing to advance its lead program EPY201 through Phase 1/2a clinical trials. The round included investment from XGEN Venture, the British Business Bank, and a global biopharmaceutical company.

The funding will enable the delivery of first-in-human Phase 1/2a clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the company's lead gene therapy program EPY201 in a broad population of patients with focal refractory epilepsy (FRE). EPY201 is an adeno-associated viral (AAV) gene therapy designed to reduce neuronal hyperexcitability. It is delivered locally to the epileptogenic focus of the patient and therefore avoids the complications of systemic delivery. EPY201 offers FRE patients the prospect of seizure freedom in a single intervention without resection or ablation of brain tissue and without the chronic use of multiple antiseizure medicines.

EpilepsyGTx will also advance a pipeline of transformative gene therapies targeting refractory epilepsy and disorders of neuronal hyperexcitability with future financings.

Focal epilepsy describes a group of disorders in which patients experience seizures that arise from a specific part of the brain. If seizures persist despite trials of at least two tolerated and appropriately chosen antiseizure medicines, epilepsy is deemed refractory. FRE affects about 10 million patients worldwide, including 2 million patients in the US, UK and EU. EPY201 offers the potential to eradicate seizures in patients with FRE with a single intervention, dramatically improving survival and quality of life.

Refractory epilepsy is a devastating condition causing unpredictable and life-threatening seizures, and affecting millions of patients worldwide. Our novel gene therapy EPY201 delivered directly to the seizure focus has the potential to stop seizures with a single, minimally invasive administration. In doing so, it will change the way refractory epilepsy has been treated for decades. We are proud to have the support of such high caliber investors as we progress into clinical trials.""

Nicolas Koebel, Chief Executive Officer, EpilepsyGTx

Federica Draghi, Managing Partner of XGEN Venture, added: ""EpilepsyGTx is pioneering a novel, locally administered gene therapy approach designed to achieve targeted modulation of epileptogenic brain regions. We believe that localized gene delivery offers a powerful avenue for durable and disease-modifying interventions in severe neurological disorders and are excited to support the company as EPY201 progresses toward clinical evaluation.""

EpilepsyGTx previously raised $10 million in pre-seed and seed funding led by the UCL Technology Fund, managed by AlbionVC in collaboration with UCL Business, the commercialization company of UCL with participation from Zcube, the venture capital arm of Zambon.

Taylor Wessing LLP acted as legal advisor to EpilepsyGTx on the financing; A&O Shearman acted as legal advisor to XGEN Venture; Panmure Liberum Cambridge Capital acted as financial advisor.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Machine learning models can help diagnose ALS earlier from a blood sample","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251210/Machine-learning-models-can-help-diagnose-ALS-earlier-from-a-blood-sample.aspx","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 16:31:00 GMT","

Using machine learning models, researchers at Michigan Medicine have identified a potential way to diagnose amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, earlier from a blood sample, a study suggests.

The models, which analyze blood for biomarkers through gene expression with RNA sequencing to detect ALS, also have the potential to predict disease severity - and how long a person might live with the neurodegenerative condition.

The results are published in Nature Communications.

Our findings present an incredible opportunity to potentially diagnose ALS earlier, which opens up doors to treatments and clinical trials for which people otherwise may not be eligible due to advanced disease.""

Eva L. Feldman, M.D., Ph.D., co-senior author, director of the ALS Center of Excellence at U-M and James W. Albers Distinguished University Professor and Russell N. DeJong Professor of Neurology at U-M

Patients with ALS typically survive between two and four years after they're diagnosed.

However, ALS is difficult for physicians to identify, especially early in the disease. Many early symptoms may overlap with other more common neurological problems.

As a result, it can take over a year to get an official diagnosis, and patients may undergo unnecessary tests and procedures.

Instead of identifying a single biomarker measure of ALS, Michigan Medicine researchers developed a gene classifier that detected several future disease biomarkers to expedite diagnosis.

This tool, called a gene expression biomarker panel, is commonly used in oncology to diagnose breast cancer and classify tumor subtypes.

Investigators found more than 2,500 unique genes that express differently in ALS compared to controls, many of which were linked to the immune system.

They input the data into a machine learning model, XGBoost, which they trained to predict whether ALS was present.

After narrowing panels down to contain between 27 and 46 genes, the model predicted ALS with up to 91% accuracy.

""After testing our model on our own samples, as well as data from other groups, it performed better than any previous attempt at an ALS biomarker signature,"" said Yue Zhao, Ph.D., first author and research assistant professor in the U-M Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics.

""Our results suggest a need for further investigation into this model as a tool to improve diagnostic accuracy and decrease diagnostic delay.""

Researchers later developed two more biomarker panels using different machine learning models to predict a person's ALS survival.

This time, in addition to gene expression levels, they added clinical information to their models. This allowed them to better differentiate between shorter, intermediate and longer surviving cases.

No other biomarker is clinically developed for ALS prognosis. However, past research has associated levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL), an indicator of neuronal damage, with ALS disease progression.

The shortcoming with NfL, researchers note, is that levels are also elevated for other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis.

""While there are several methods of scoring and scaling ALS, our method is unique in its diagnostic and prognostic potential,"" said co-author Stephen Goutman, M.D., M.S., director of the Pranger ALS Clinic, associate director of the ALS Center of Excellence, and Harriet Hiller Research Professor at U-M.

The analysis also revealed specific ""core genes"" in the blood of people with ALS that share features with the motor neurons in the spinal cord that are primarily affected by the disease.

Investigators leveraged the core genes to discover eight potential drugs that could have future therapeutic potential in ALS, after more research is completed.

Some of those drugs, such as the antipsychotic trifluoperazine and the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib, have been previously linked to ALS research.

Researchers say future studies are needed to validate these findings and drug targets before they can be applied to the clinical space.

""Pursuing these important next steps has incredible potential to advance diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities in ALS that could ultimately improve clinical care,"" said Maureen A. Sartor, Ph.D., co-senior author and a professor of computational medicine and bioinformatics at U-M Medical School.

""It is an exciting time in ALS research.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Learn to navigate regulatory pathways for SaMD","https://www.news-medical.net/whitepaper/20251210/Learn-to-navigate-regulatory-pathways-for-SaMD.aspx","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 12:28:00 GMT","

Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) is software that functions independently of any hardware device and is intended for medical purposes. SaMD is not the same as SiMD, which is firmware embedded into a physical device.

Navigating the SaMD regulatory pathways is one of the most complex yet important aspects of product development for medical technology startups.

Startups in this field are required to meet local regulatory expectations, for example, the European Union's Medical Device Regulation (EU MDR), or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements, as well as aligning with international frameworks such as the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF).

Innovation must go hand in hand with regulatory discipline. In the rapidly expanding digital health sector, ensuring compliance across these jurisdictions is key to ensuring patient safety, investor confidence, and market access.

The IMDRF defines SaMD as “software intended to be used for one or more medical purposes that perform these purposes without being part of a hardware medical device.”

This definition has been established to provide a strong foundation for global harmonization, enabling regulators across regions to interpret and categorize software consistently.

The IMDRF's SaMD framework incorporates three key principles:

The principles outlined by the IMDRF have been adopted by many regulators, including the FDA, the EU, and Japan's PMDA. Early alignment with IMDRF guidance can help to streamline multi-region approvals and reduce rework in the later stages of development.

SaMD products are regulated as medical devices in the United States in line with the FDA's risk-based framework. SaMD classifications span Class I to III, depending on the related level of patient risk.

The primary pathways for U.S. market entry include:

FDA's guidance, such as “SaMD: Clinical Evaluation” and its risk categorization framework, has been created directly on IMDRF principles.

The Digital Health Center of Excellence is currently working on a range of ongoing initiatives, including guidance on cybersecurity expectations and AI/ML-based software.

Submissions generally require robust evidence of effectiveness, safety, and effective cybersecurity management.

The FDA also applies enforcement discretion to some low-risk health and wellness applications, easing regulatory requirements for developers of software that has minimal impact on patients.

This trend includes aspects such as Predetermined Change Control Plans (PCCPs) and the developing area of Notified Body (NB) scrutiny.

Clinical expectations vary between different regulatory bodies. For instance, the FDA only requires clinical data when it is required by risk of claims, while the EU's Medical Device Regulations (MDR) require a CER, and typically ask for Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) for each individual SaMD.

The EU's Medical Device Regulation (MDR 2017/745) has significantly increased software compliance requirements in Europe.

Rule 11 now categorizes the majority of standalone diagnostic or therapeutic software into Class IIa, IIb, or III, depending on its potential risk and intended use. While it was once common under the old MDD, this reclassification means that self-certification is now rare.

There are several key steps to achieving MDR compliance. These include:

It is essential to note that new EU developments, such as extended transition timelines for legacy devices, do not apply to new SaMD, as these are required to meet MDR requirements immediately.

Many countries and regions outside of the U.S. and EU also align their SaMD frameworks with IMDRF principles. For instance:

Companies can develop a unified regulatory strategy by maintaining global consistency through IMDRF-aligned categorization.

Keeping informed is essential for long-term compliance planning as the IMDRF continues to refine its guidance, particularly in terms of rapidly evolving areas like AI and adaptive algorithms.

Strategic foresight and cross-functional collaboration are required to successfully navigate multiple regulatory systems. MedTech startups can implement a number of practical steps to reduce friction in this area, including:

An early, integrated approach is required to successfully navigate SaMD regulatory pathways, particularly one that embeds compliance into product development.

Companies that use IMDRF's risk framework should perform thorough evaluations of their clinical and cybersecurity capabilities, proactively planning for post-market obligations to position themselves for success throughout global markets.

AI/ML regulations and real-world evidence requirements are reshaping expectations around digital health as part of a dynamic and evolving regulatory landscape.

Regulatory literacy and agility are as important as technical excellence for innovators, and successfully aligning innovation with compliance is key to both accelerating approvals and fostering trust with patients, clinicians, and investors.

MedTech startups can transform regulatory complexity into a competitive advantage by combining informed strategy with the right partnerships.

An ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza has affected more than 184 million domestic poultry since 2022 and, since making the leap to dairy cattle in spring 2024, more than 1,000 milking cow herds.

A new study led by Iowa State University researchers shows that the mammary glands of several other production animals – including pigs, sheep, goats, beef cattle and alpacas – are biologically suitable to harbor avian influenza, due to high levels of sialic acids.

The main thing we wanted to understand in this study is whether there is potential for transmission among these other domestic mammals and humans, and it looks like there is.""

Rahul Nelli, study's lead author and research assistant professor of veterinary diagnostic and production animal medicine

Sialic acid, a sugar molecule found on the surface of many types of animal cells, provides an influenza virus the microscopic docking station it needs to infect a host cell, an entry point for attaching and invading. A study by many of the same researchers last year found that dairy cattle udders have high levels of sialic acid, which helped explain why the H5N1 avian influenza outbreak was able to spread rapidly among dairy herds.

In the study published Nov. 27 in the Journal of Dairy Science, a research team that includes scientists from the ISU College of Veterinary Medicine and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Animal Disease Center in Ames also found the same receptors in the mammary glands of the humans.

Only a few sporadic cases of H5N1 infection have been reported in the animals examined in the new study, but those species aren't being tested on a widespread basis, said Dr. Todd Bell, professor of veterinary pathology and a study co-author.

""If we don't look, we don't know,"" Bell said.

In dairy herds, H5N1 infections are causing sick cows to produce milk contaminated with the virus, prompting nationwide surveillance testing of raw cow milk samples by the USDA. Pasteurization kills influenza viruses, so store-bought milk is safe. But concerns about raw milk should extend to other mammalian livestock, Nelli said.

""Some people do consume the raw milk of these other animals,"" he said.

The presence of the virus in milk from infected cows has likely played a role in the H5N1 spreading and makes transmission to humans a bigger risk, Nelli said.

""If a virus in livestock is being spread by respiratory infections, few humans will be in close enough contact to catch it. But milk is an entirely different situation because it's transported into communities,"" he said. 

All of the mammary gland tissues examined in the new study had sialic acid receptors preferred by both avian influenza and the seasonal influenza that circulates more readily among humans. The possibility of both types of viruses comingling and transmitting between different species heightens concerns about more dangerous adaptations emerging, Bell said. H5N1 has in the past had a fatality rate in humans of around 50%, though the 71 confirmed human infections during the current outbreak have led to just two deaths.

""We need to try to stay ahead of this so it doesn't have a chance to continue to replicate and potentially evolve into something even more troublesome,"" he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Doctors warn about cardiovascular dangers from excessive energy drink use","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251209/Doctors-warn-about-cardiovascular-dangers-from-excessive-energy-drink-use.aspx","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 01:47:00 GMT","

Downing several strong energy drinks every day may pose a serious stroke risk, doctors have warned in the journal BMJ Case Reports, after treating an otherwise fit and healthy man in his 50s with a daily 8-can habit and exceedingly high blood pressure.

The findings prompt the authors to call for tighter regulation of the sales and advertising of these drinks, particularly given their popularity among young people.

The man in question had a stroke in his thalamus-the part of the brain involved in sensory perception and movement. His symptoms included left-sided weakness, numbness, as well as difficulties with balance, walking, swallowing and speech-collectively known as ataxia.

On admission to hospital his blood pressure was 254/150 mm Hg, which is regarded as extremely high.

He was started on drugs to lower his blood pressure, and his systolic blood pressure-reflecting arterial pressure during the heart's pump action-fell to 170 mm Hg.

But once back home, his blood pressure rose again and remained persistently high despite the ramping up of his drug treatment.

On further questioning, he revealed that he drank an average of 8 energy drinks every day, each of which contained 160 mg of caffeine, adding up to a daily intake of 1200-1300 mg of caffeine: the recommended maximum daily intake is 400 mg.

He was asked to give up this daily habit, after which his blood pressure returned to normal and blood pressure lowering drugs were no longer needed.

But he didn't regain full feeling on his left side. Commenting on the experience, he said: ""I obviously wasn't aware of the dangers drinking energy drinks were causing to myself. (I) have been left with numbness (in my) left hand side hand and fingers, foot and toes even after 8 years.""

The report authors point out that the man's lack of awareness about the potential cardiovascular risks associated with heavy energy drink consumption is probably not surprising as they aren't generally thought of as a potential cardiovascular disease risk.

""The year 2018 saw major UK supermarkets implement a voluntary ban on sales of [these drinks] to under 16s in a drive to tackle obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay, but less explored are the possible increased risks of [energy drinks] for cardiovascular disease, including ischaemic [restricted blood supply or blood clot] and hemorrhagic [bleed in the brain] strokes, particularly in younger demographics otherwise expected to have lower stroke risk,"" they emphasize.

Energy drinks contain more than 150 mg of caffeine per litre and typically have a very high glucose-based sugar content and varying quantities of other chemicals, they highlight.

""This declared amount is the 'pure caffeine', but other ingredients contain 'hidden caffeine'- for example, guarana is thought to contain caffeine at twice the concentration of a coffee bean.

""The hypothesis is that the interaction of these other ingredients, including taurine, guarana, ginseng and glucuronolactone, potentiates the effects of caffeine heightening stroke [cardiovascular disease] risk through numerous mechanisms,"" they explain.

""The average [energy drink] is said to contain around 80 mg of caffeine per 250 ml serving, compared with 30 mg in tea and 90 mg in coffee, but in some cases can contain up to 500 mg in a single serving,"" they point out.

This report represents just one case, but the authors nevertheless conclude: ""While the current evidence is not conclusive, given the accumulating literature, the high morbidity and mortality associated with stroke and [cardiovascular disease] and the well-documented adverse health effects of high-sugar drinks, we propose that increased regulation of [energy drink] sales and advertising campaigns (which are often targeted at younger ages) could be beneficial to the future cerebrovascular and cardiovascular health of our society.""

A new statewide spatial analysis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) has uncovered significant disparities in Maryland's rural communities, offering a striking example of how healthcare accessibility is shaping health outcomes across the United States. 

More than 90% of larger hospitals are located in urban areas, leaving rural hospitals with fewer resources and very small operating margins. One of the biggest challenges is the shortage of doctors, nurses, and specialists trained in Alzheimer's and dementia care, who are concentrated in urban centers. As a result, patients in rural areas, many of whom are over 80 years old, often face the additional burden of traveling much longer distances to access the care they need. 

Alzheimer's disease affects more than 6.9 million Americans, and its prevalence is expected to double by 2060, according to the Alzheimer's Association. This research demonstrates that where a person lives can determine whether they receive timely diagnosis and care or whether they fall through the cracks. 

The study analyzed 422,735 patients in Maryland in 2019, identifying reveal that many ADRD cases may remain in underserved rural areas, particularly in eastern and western Maryland, where high mortality rates coincide with low diagnosis rates. These results come amid ongoing funding challenges serious consequences for older and underserved populations. 

By identifying hospital accessibility, demographic factors, and comorbidities like diabetes ADRD patterns, the study provides evidence that could inform targeted policy interventions in clinics, hospitals, and outreach programs not just in Maryland, but across rural America. 

KEY FINDINGS: 

Underserved regions in eastern and western Maryland show high ADRD mortality rates despite low diagnosis rates, suggesting that many cases remain undiagnosed. 

Hospital accessibility is unevenly distributed, with urban areas having significantly better access than rural areas, where mortality rates are elevated. 

Spatial regression analysis (Getis-Ord G* and GWR models) revealed that lower hospital accessibility is associated with higher poverty rates and higher health risk rates, including diabetes and heart disease. 

Regional variations in these relationships were confirmed through spatial analysis, demonstrating that localized factors significantly influence ADRD outcomes.

Visit Santa Barbara, UCSB Collaborate to Host International Match Between U.S. and Chile on January 27

The U.S. Women's National Soccer Team will host an international match at UCSB's Harder Stadium for the first time in history, as the U.S. is set to face Chile for a Tuesday night matchup on January 27, 2026. This will be the first time the U.S. Women's National Team has played at UCSB since U.S. soccer hosted two exhibition games at Harder Stadium prior to the Women's World Cup in 1991.

Visit Santa Barbara helped coordinate with the U.S. Women's National Team to bring an elite game to South Coast soccer fans and attract visiting sports fans to attend the game and spend time in the area's hotels, restaurants, and shops.

“We are thrilled to welcome the U.S. Women's National Team to UCSB for their match against Chile in January,” said Visit Santa Barbara South Coast President and CEO Kathy Janega-Dykes. “Visit S.B.'s mission is to inspire overnight travel to the South Coast to enhance the community's economy and quality of life. Sports tourism plays a vital role in that effort, especially during the shoulder season, when this exciting match takes place.”

The January 27 match will be the first-ever international match on the Central Coast, and only the second time an international match has been played north of Los Angeles and south of San Francisco. 

“One of the goals of U.S. Soccer is to take our National Teams to new markets around the country, and I applaud that,” said U.S. head coach Emma Hayes. “Playing in a city for the first time is not a common occurrence at this point in our history so I know our players will enjoy being in beautiful Santa Barbara and our staff are really looking forward to January camp and these matches against two tough South American countries. This is the start of an important year for our team and as always, we're focused on maximizing every minute we get with the players.”

The U.S. Women's National Team has held training camps in Santa Barbara several times in its history, including in March 2019 — just a few months before the team went on to win the World Cup — and again in 2023 when the team practiced at UCSB and Westmont College. The U.S. played an exhibition match in 1991, where they defeated the UCSB women's team 10-0 before going on to win the country's first-ever World Cup later that summer.

The U.S. Men's National Team has played an international match at Harder Stadium once, in 1993, where the U.S. men's team played a 1-1 draw against Romania in front of a crowd of more than 9,000.

Presale tickets for the January 27 match will be available starting at 10 a.m. on December 10 and will run through 8 a.m. on December 12. Tickets will be available for the public after 10 a.m. on December 12.

A major event for American soccer fans will take place in the Tri-Counties. 

The U.S. Women's National Soccer Team will play Chile on January 27 at UC Santa Barbara's Harder Stadium.

The U.S. team is the most successful in the history of international women's soccer, having won four FIFA championships and five Olympic gold medals.

The U.S. team will train in January at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, which is home to the LA Galaxy Major League Soccer franchise.

Presale tickets for the Harder Stadium match go on sale at 10 a.m. Wednesday, and public sales begin Friday morning.

In 2010 and 2022, the US faced heightened emotions from the lead-in to the tournament itself. As hosts next year, little will change

The draw is done. The schedule is set. For the US men's national team, all that's left, aside from playing the games, are the emotional highs and lows. After the draw, US head coach Mauricio Pochettino referenced a “competitive stress” factor triggered by the World Cup. He said the friendlies against Belgium and Portugal in March are intended to simulate that stress so that it doesn't surprise his players when the spotlight of the World Cup arrives.

With the margins always thin at a World Cup, earning results that mitigate that pressure could prove to be the difference between the USMNT crashing out just when they capture the undivided attention of the nation, or enduring and soaring to a best-ever finish.

Stress can seep into the emotions of a team well before the World Cup. Landon Donovan, a veteran of three World Cups, described an excitement that's “very palpable and different” when the squad convenes for a World Cup camp, but acknowledged “it also depends on where you are in the pecking order.”

Head coach Bob Bradley had clearly conveyed to his core where they stood during the 2010 cycle, which included not just qualifiers but also the now-defunct Confederations Cup in 2009.

“He had pulled us into a room a year prior [to the World Cup], about 15 of us, and said, ‘Guys, you are the 15 who are going to be there for sure,'” Donovan told the Guardian. “And over the next year, three or four more probably solidified their spot. But then there were three to six spots that were still up for grabs. Mentally, for guys who knew they were going and who were going to be contributors, it's all about preparation. But there were other guys who were very much competing for their spots, and so everything was at stake every day.”

Before the 2010 World Cup, 30 players were summoned to Bradley's alma mater, Princeton, for camp. The first send-off friendly against the Czech Republic was the last audition for a lot of nervous players to make the 23-man squad.

“When all is said and done, the hardest part is going from 30 to 23 [for the World Cup squad] in a short amount of time,” Bradley told the Guardian. “Would [I] do that exactly the same? I don't know. You had certain decisions that had to get made. You needed to see certain guys up close, but there's a lot of pressure, and guys felt that.”

Pochettino has hinted that only the 26 players on the 2026 tournament squad will be heading to the new US Soccer national training center in Atlanta ahead of the World Cup.

“I think from the beginning, if you say, ‘OK, that is the 26,' that is a shock, but [eventually] you accept [it],” Pochettino said. “But after being involved and then that's it, go home, I think it's more cruel.”

There's also simply less time for late tryouts, with Pochettino's pre-World Cup camp shorter than previous runways to the summer version of the tournament. They'll be assembling on 27 May, with two friendlies instead of three. But it's not quite as condensed as the preparation for World Cup in 2022, when most of Berhalter's squad flew straight from Europe to Qatar.

“It was a surreal feeling,” left-back Antonee Robinson said. “I can kind of remember the whole experience, going straight from the [Premier League] game with [Fulham teammate] Tim Ream straight to the airport and getting on the plane. And when we land in Qatar, that's when the reality sinks [in]. ‘We're actually here now.'”

The USMNT had plenty of talent at Europe's top clubs for the 2022 World Cup, but also boasted the tournament's second-youngest roster.

“No matter how much experience you have, when you play in a World Cup, it's a different type of game,” Berhalter said. “And I'll never forget the conversation with Yunus [Musah] after the Wales game, he was like, ‘Oh my God, this felt like a final of a tournament.' That's how intense the game was, and it's exhausting. It's physically exhausting, mentally exhausting, but that's what the World Cup is.”

There wasn't a shortage of World Cup experience with Bradley's squad in 2010, but Donovan was the only one set to start at his third straight tournament. In his World Cup debut in 2002 the US stunned Portugal 3-2, and eight years later they were set to face England in the World Cup opener.

“I knew that the difference about a round robin World Cup tournament is that every goal is crucial, which means every play is crucial,” Donovan said. “We weren't expected to win the [England] game – but we were confident that we were a team capable of beating them.”

However, captain Steven Gerrard gave England the lead in the fourth minute.

“I knew the chances of qualification [for the knockout round] go down significantly if you lose your first game,” Donovan said. “And so the pressure was on to get something out of the game.”

The US were gifted an equalizer by England goalkeeper Robert Green and held their own to secure a point, but the pressure mounted even more in their second group game against Slovenia after conceding two first-half goals.

“When we got to half-time and we were down two, that was a key moment for that group. We knew we needed to get one or three points. Other than that, we're out,” Bradley said.

Less than three minutes after the break an authoritative Donovan strike cut the deficit in half. In the 82nd minute Michael Bradley tied it at 2-2. And a few minutes later, Maurice Edu buried a Donovan free kick to complete an exhilarating comeback win … but the goal was inexplicably disallowed.

And in the group finale against Algeria, the pressure would keep climbing until second half stoppage time, when Donovan's game-winner became the most famous moment in USMNT history. The win, though exhilarating, brought other issues.

After Donovan's viral moment, the US had just three days to mentally reset and prepare for Ghana in the next round.

“It's really hard,” Donovan said. “It's one of the hardest things in sports, and one of the least talked about things in sports. Of course there was a physical drain, but the emotional drain, it's hard as a human, even as a trained athlete, to get yourself up again after such an emotional game … When you win a game in that fashion, it's hard not to sort of let your guard down a little and feel relief. And so even immediately after the game, we're in the locker room having a beer with President Clinton… it's hard not to get caught up in the moment. And candidly, I'm glad we got caught up in the moment. That was one of the best few hours of our lives.”

The 2022 team faced its own tense conclusion to the group stage. Although they hadn't trailed yet in Qatar, three points slipped away late in the opener against Wales when Gareth Bale drew then converted a penalty kick. The US then held their own in another marquee group matchup with England, earning a point.

“The England game was a very strong performance, but all it did was put us in position,” Berhalter said. “It was precarious. Iran, all they needed was a tie [against us], and they're through.”

In the end, Christian Pulisic's 38th-minute goal against Iran was enough. The US held on for three points in an extremely tense finish.

“We had a real few close calls in the match where Iran nearly equalized with us. And then on the flip side of it, that was why I was like so consoling to their players,” Robinson said. “Throughout the course of the World Cup, I had had some family things going on which was kind of why I was emotional anyway … the joy of the fact we'd actually got through, I did my ankle in that game, so the pain I was feeling, that was all swirling around at the same time and it busted me up a bit.”

In 2010, with qualification secured, Bradley leaned on longtime US Soccer administrator Tom King to surprise the team by bringing their families – who were staying 20 minutes away – to celebrate at the team's home base. Similarly in 2022, following the win over Iran, Berhalter gave his team the next day off to spend time with their families. It would be a much-needed rest before the stresses to come.

Berhalter acknowledged that the Iran match “took a toll on the guys mentally” and the Round of 16 clash with the Netherlands “came really quickly.” The US benefited from a state-of-the-art recovery and medical setup along with a meticulously planned player lounge which Berhalter had fundraised for. But emotionally, they could only absorb so much.

“We didn't have that edge, and I don't think we had it because there was an emotional toll that the World Cup took on the group, and we weren't really prepared for that over time,” Berhalter said.

Berhalter also points to the Netherlands' extensive experience performing in big moments; a big contrast to his upstart US squad.

“The guys were ready to play. But you have to understand that there's a difference between playing well, and eliminating Holland in a World Cup knockout stage,” Berhalter said. “The coach has been there before, the team has been there before. These weren't World Cup rookies, and they had the edge.”

Bradley believed his 2010 team were built for the psychological strain in South Africa, noting their high-profile friendlies during the cycle, plus their run to the Confederations Cup final the previous year.

They weren't fazed when they fell behind in the fifth minute against Ghana.

“We used an expression sometimes, ‘play it on the edge,' where you got to go for it, because now you're behind or whatever,” Bradley said. “And we had experiences in those kinds of games where we knew how to push a game.”

The US equalized with a Donovan penalty kick, but were eliminated in extra time.

In both 2010 and 2022, the US arguably met expectations by advancing to the knockout round. But there is still disappointment, some of which is natural for any tournament exit, and some of which is rooted in the United States' continuing quest to establish themselves among the world's best sides.

Robinson noted that the US had knockout experience and success in Concacaf, but face the challenge of translating it to a bigger stage.

“We can't lean on the fact that we've done it before,” he said. “It's been a long, long time, and the players in our squad haven't done it, but we're just going to have to try and get into that mental gear of expecting ourselves to be able to win knockout games and go in with true belief that would go into [it] because if you turn up to the tournament and you don't truly believe that you could actually go far and win the whole thing, then you're putting yourself at a massive disadvantage to everyone else.”

Donovan also underlined the importance of setting the bar higher than it has traditionally been in US soccer.

“My opinion is that it boils down to expectations, and when we get to a point where we expect to get to a quarter-final or a semi-final or a final, like probably 8-10 other teams in the World Cup will be doing next summer, there's a mentality piece where you're not just satisfied to get to a certain point. You want to keep going,” Donovan said. “Everybody, of course, wants to keep going. But when we got to the quarter-finals against Germany in 2002, from an expectation standpoint we had already exceeded it. And so it was almost playing with house money.”

The expectations for those top international teams are, of course, primarily a function of their quality. While the US has not yet ascended to that tier of talent, they could get a boost from hosting the tournament in 2026. Berhalter highlighted Morocco in 2022 and Korea in 2002 as replicable examples of momentum and favorable crowds carrying those teams further than what seemed possible on paper. Robinson stressed that at a World Cup in particular, the game is not decided on paper.

“It doesn't always come down to who's the best team, it comes down to which team wants to win more,” he said. “So making sure that we have our themes of how we want to play in the background, but the overarching theme is going to be we have to compete more, we have to fight more than the other team, and if we win that battle, then [I'm] hoping that our quality of the team shines through after that.”

That will apply, first and foremost, to the group stage, where the US are favored. Friendly wins against Paraguay and Australia previewed the intensity of their World Cup meetings, featuring literal fights and hard tackles.

“They were friendlies, but also they weren't very friendly,” Tim Ream said after the draw. “And now you add in the heightened aggression and experience of a World Cup, and they're all finals, they all mean something now. Everything is going to be ramped up exponentially.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

The FIFA World Cup Draw at the Kennedy Center last week was the sort of surrealist spectacle that can take a few days to truly absorb. (FIFA president Gianni Infantino gave Donald Trump a “FIFA Peace Prize” that he accepted with legitimate joy and appreciation in a way that gets more disturbing the more you think about it.) Every time I think about it, I find myself tapping the right side of my head with my palm like I'm trying to get water out of my ear. But a little lost in all the absurdity was what the event ostensibly exists for in the first place: announcing the groups, matchups, and schedule for the cup itself, which will be hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico next year. And while the draw was a nightmare for the U.S. as a country — an estimated 200 million people around the planet watched us immolate in real time — it was a dream for the U.S. as a soccer team.

In terms of our national teams, there is no squad more reliably dramatic than the U.S. men's soccer. The men's and women's Olympic basketball teams win every gold medal, and the women's soccer team is one of the most popular soccer teams in the world, but the USMNT is always going through it. I have been writing about the pending breakthrough of the U.S. men's team for this magazine for more than a decade now, and the team has rewarded me by persistently falling on its face. It's fired multiple coaches, restructured their entire operation, and had players fighting with their coaches (including star Christian Pulisic and current coach Mauricio Pochettino), and, worst of fall, it imploded by missing the 2018 World Cup entirely, unquestionably U.S. soccer's nadir at the exact moment it was supposed to making its big leap forward. (The most recent disaster was being bonked from the 2024 Copa America at the exact same moment, just a few miles away in Atlanta, that Joe Biden was having his own debacle on a CNN debate stage.) You can always count on U.S. soccer to break your heart.

That is why the draw last Friday caused equal parts excitement and anxiety. The U.S. could have ended up facing powers such as Morocco, Switzerland, or Norway (led by Premier League stars Erling Haaland and Martin Ødegaard) in its group: Instead, it got relative weaklings Australia and Paraguay. The third team in its group will be determined in a March playoff, but worst-case scenario, it's Turkey, which is still ranked below the U.S. (and is enmeshed in a gambling scandal), and in the best case, it's Kosovo, the 80th-ranked team in the world. The United States is heavily favored to win its group, something it has only done once, back in 2010. As the home nation, the U.S. has a terrific opportunity to advance to the quarterfinals for the second time ever. It got the best draw imaginable. “This is about as favorable of a group as the U.S. could have hoped for,” wrote ESPN's Bill Connelly.

This is happening at the same time that the U.S. team has been playing better than it has in years, and for good reason. Pochettino, formerly the coach for the Tottenham Hotspurs, has made some strategic adjustments and embraced what he calls “organized chaos,” leading to some eye-opening wins, including a stunner of a 5-1 blowout against Uruguay last month. Pochettino also seems to have won his staring contest with Pulisic: He lambasted Pulisic for skipping out on the Gold Cup, and Pulisic fired back at him, but now everything is simpatico, thanks largely to Pochettino's making tactical adjustments that benefitted the way Pulisic likes to play. The USMNT has its coaching staff and roster aligned for the first time in nearly a half-decade. That's particularly valuable because this is unquestionably the most talented roster ever, with more international players playing in the top leagues than anyone could have imagined even a decade ago. While the USMNT hasn't seen the success on the pitch of the elevation of national talent, it's certainly seeing it with its players on club teams: The roster is stacked.

Does that mean the USMNT is going to win the World Cup? Obviously not. (“The Athletic,” which called the team the “big winners of the draw,” has the U.S. as the 14th-most-likely team to take home the trophy, which corresponds with its current FIFA ranking.) But it means it's never been more set up to succeed than it is right now, even not accounting for the gentle results from the draw. The last decade has featured constant predictions that the U.S. was about to finally break through, hopefully just in time for hosting the 2026 World Cup. It has been a rocky ride to get there, to say the least, but it looks like the stars are aligning.

This is of course a reason to be more scared, not less: We have all been excited before. But there is something weirdly perverse about USMNT having everything lay out perfectly for them at the exact moment that the U.S. and its president are set to humiliate themselves in front of the entire world. (New fun development: The ACLU is warning that FIFA — famously one of the most corrupt organizations on the globe — “risks becoming a stage for authoritarianism” simply by being involved with the United States.) Infantino and FIFA have made Trump — who continues to threaten to pull the cup out of “blue cities” — the centerpiece of the biggest sporting event on earth, and we're going to have to deal with that all next summer. It is a little ominous that the notoriously combustible, self-destructing USMNT feels comparatively stable and reliable.

One of Mauricio Pochettino's most impassioned appeals as United States head coach came a few weeks ago and it centered on a simple concept: that every game matters.

The Argentinian's philosophy, of course, was an accurate, if not entirely original, idea. In the interests of transparency, its motivation was to explain that friendlies are just as important as games with something tangible at stake when you're trying to build up a program.

Yet as the dust settles on last week's World Cup draw and the USMNT is left to reflect on a winnable group that also carries some lurking danger, it may also be true that some matches carry a little more importance than others — even within the opening stage of the tournament.

For the Americans, there is some solid evidence to suggest that the most crucial game of the campaign is the very first, against Paraguay in Los Angeles, on June 12 next year.

“We'll be looking forward to that for a while,” Milan's U.S. forward Christian Pulisic told reporters following the draw.

With good reason.

Firstly, Paraguay may turn out to be the most accomplished opponent Pochettino's squad faces in Group D, with a FIFA world ranking of 39 but an Elo rating placing it 21st, and wins against Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil in CONMEBOL qualifying. Australia is also in the group, along with a UEFA playoff winner that is still to be determined from Turkey, Romania, Slovakia and Kosovo.

The South Americans will also have some fuel to keep their motivation bubbling apace, following a late-game scuffle at the end of a 2-1 November friendly loss to the USMNT outside Philadelphia that was described by Pochettino as “very, very dangerous.”

Pulisic said the identity of the first opponent was less important than the reality that the first U.S. match of the World Cup is going to be one of the most anticipated matches in American soccer history.

“Yeah, it doesn't matter who we're playing,” Pulisic added. “I mean, first match of the World Cup, obviously playing in L.A., we're going to be ready for that game.”

Major tournament campaigns are unpredictable by design but for the U.S., going back to the very beginning of its modern era of national team soccer, there is a pattern that suggests the opening match of any World Cup schedule carries magnified significance.

Since returning to soccer's greatest show in 1990 following a four decade absence, any time the U.S. has lost its first group game, it has been bounced out of the event before the knockout stage.

Conversely, any time it has avoided defeat to kick things off, it has progressed to at least the first knockout round.

“Getting three points right off the bat like that would be an amazing start for us and just put us in a great position in the group,” said Pulisic.

The opposite also applies. In 1990, an outgunned U.S. team was thrashed 5-1 by Czechoslovakia before finishing last in Group A on the back of three straight defeats.

At home in 1994, a 1-1 draw with Switzerland, courtesy of Eric Wynalda's equalizer, helped spark progress to the round of 16, albeit as the group's third-place finisher.

Losses to Germany in 1998 and the Czech Republic in 2006 spelled disaster for miserable campaigns that saw the U.S. take just one point from six games, finishing bottom of the group both times.

The U.S. has claimed a pair of first-game victories, against Portugal in a major upset in 2002 and Ghana in 2014, progressing as group runner-up each time. Draws against England in 2010 and Wales in 2022 also led to qualification for the next round, the former as group winner.

With the World Cup's expansion to 48 teams for this tournament in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, Pochettino will like his team's chance of getting into the thick of the elimination rounds, and will certainly be setting his sights higher than merely making it through the group.

He will be aware of what he is facing from the outset, however, and Paraguay head coach Gustavo Alfaro – who was also the opposing coach for a World Cup host's opener in 2022, when he guided Ecuador to a 2-0 win against Qatar – and his players will be hungry to reverse last month's result.

“The U.S. is a very intense team,” Alfaro said at the time. “It is a team with a physical capacity that provokes the proposal of intensity and mobility and rotation. You have to play with the same intensity.”

As for the difficulty of the task faced by slow starters, there are multiple ways to look at past World Cup outcomes. In terms of format, the closest replicas to the 2026 tournament are the World Cups from 1986, 1990 and 1994, all of which were played with 24 teams that funneled into a 16-team knockout stage, half the size of next summer's competition.

In those instances, the cumulative “first game” record of the 24 teams eliminated after group play was two wins, five losses and 17 defeats.

So while Pochettino's “every game matters” assessment is reasonable, getting out of the blocks quickly may be as good an indicator as any of a bright path ahead.

U.S. men's national team forward Folarin Balogun led Monaco to a 1–0 victory over Galatasaray on Tuesday night, sealing his name in the Champions League record books along the way.

The 24-year-old became the first USMNT player in history to score in three consecutive Champions League games. Balogun found the back of the net against Bodø/Glimt, Pafos and now Galatasaray to achieve a feat not even Christian Pulisic ever managed.

The goal was nothing remarkable from the American at Monaco's Stade Louis II, but it was enough to secure all three points for the French outfit. Galatasaray keeper Günay Güvenç failed to deal with a dangerous inswinging corner, giving Balogun the opening to guide home the game's only goal.

Balogun has now scored six goals in his last seven appearances for club and country. After an underwhelming 2024–25 season in which the striker only found the back of the net four times for Monaco, he is rediscovering his form in front of goal at the perfect time.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup is only six months away, and the USMNT will need Balogun at his best if the Stars and Stripes want to make a run on home soil next summer. Mauricio Pochettino's side landed a favorable Group D draw, where they will take on Australia, Paraguay and the winner of UEFA Playoff C.

At Copa América 2024, Balogun was the undisputed leader of the USMNT's frontline. The American scored two of the team's three goals at the tournament before the Stars and Stripes crashed out in the group stage.

Injury then marred much of Balogun's 2024–25 season, keeping him out of contention for the USMNT. In his absence, Haji Wright, Patrick Agyemang and Ricardo Pepi all took turns logging minutes up top under Pochettino.

Agyemang scored two goals at last summer's Gold Cup, but ultimately failed to impress. Wright, though, bagged a brace in the U.S.'s 2–1 win over Australia during the October international window, and Pepi has found the back of the net in his last three appearances for PSV Eindhoven.

Balogun has more competition than ever to keep his place in Pochettino's lineup, but his historic Champions League goalscoring streak will no doubt help his cause.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","ASN article: Americans abroad: Pulisic, Balogun, and Pepi stand out, while others struggle","http://www.americansoccernow.com/articles/americans-abroad-pulisic-balogun-and-pepi-stand-out-while-others-struggle","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 17:07:05 GMT","

IT'S WEDNESDAY AND THAT means one thing here at ASN – a look at the world of Americans abroad with a weekly column. The past week has been mostly quiet with a lot of injuries, suspensions, limited minutes, and unused substitutions. There are always high points to distract from the bad, but overall, it has been a decidedly mixed season in Europe for Americans.

This past week was a good representation of that. Big goals from Ricardo Pepi and Folaring Balogun in the Champions League along with Christian Pulisic having a banner sub appearance and another solid outing from Chris Richards made for great headlines, but after that it was lackluster.

On the other hand, with it being December, we are now starting to hear transfer rumors.

 

Pulisic has scored a lot of goals and turned in big performances. A December game against a midtable opponent doesn't make for a big stage, but it's also the stage that defines great players. Great players are quality even when games are routine.

On Monday, Milan was trailing Torino 2-1in the 67th minute when Christian Pulisic entered the game. One minute after coming on, Pulisic equalized. Then 10 minutes later, he bagged a winner. He only began the game on the bench because he was feeling ill with flu-like symptoms earlier in the week.

This season, Pulisic now has seven goals and two assists in 446 minutes in Serie A.

It is probably a good thing that Pulisic is not playing European soccer in the run up to the World Cup. It limits the chances for him to be tired or injured heading into this tournament.

So how many goals would Pulisic have scored if he didn't have the flu or if he started? pic.twitter.com/D954uzx7vp





When just looking at his time on the field, he's been dominating Serie A. It's just the best American player doing his thing at an elite level for one of the world's most historical teams.

 

It hasn't been a good start to the season for Cole Campbell. He was rumored to be moving to Stuttgart in the summer, but the move never happened. He wasn't earning minutes and Borussia Dortmund released him to play for the U.S. team at the U-20 World Cup where he never was able to get going. Since his return, he has not played for the first team and only occasionally was making the bench.

Now we have a report from HLN in Belgium, which says Campbell is on the verge of moving to Club Brugge which currently sits third in the Belgian First Division. This is likely due to the potential transfer of Christos Tzolis as Brugge is likely to receive very lucrative offers from top clubs for the Greek winger.

According to this Belgian report, recent U.S U-20 World Cup winger Cole Campbell is set to transfer from Borussia Dortmund to Club Brugge in Januaryhttps://t.co/KnUeTlh7u7 pic.twitter.com/HoZccWahN9



At this point, any move that gets Campbell on the field is a positive step. The hope is that Club Brugge has a plan for Campbell and rates him. But the U-20 World Cup showed Campbell needs work. The upside is there, and the fact he has elite speed is promising. But it's up to Campbell to respond to the coaching he receives and learns from his time on the field. It is no guarantee that he will, but moving to Belgium is a needed step down.

Campbell needs to be careful. He was scouted at Brugge in recent weeks or months, but Club Brugge recently fired their coach last week and replaced him with Ivan Lecko. Does Lecko rate Campbell the same? No one has the answer to that yet.

For the U.S. team, Campbell is likely one of the players who will be in the pool for the 2028 Olympics and he participated in the U.S. U-21 camp in November – which will grow into the U-23 team for 2028.

 

Ricardo Pepi continues to make life very hard for PSV manager Peter Bosz. Bosz likely prefers a variety of other options, and PSV has played well this season even without Pepi on the field. But Pepi continues to score at an impressive rate – which he has done ever since joining the club.

The former FC Dallas product had a great week which began on Saturday with a start against Heerenveen. PSV won the game and Pepi scored his fifth goal of the Eredivisie season in 511 minutes.

Then on Wednesday, Pepi scored his third goal in the Champions League this season when he came off the bench to pull one back in what was eventually a 3-2 loss to Atletico.

Eventually, Bosz is going to have to decide whether to make Pepi the sole starter or sell him for a lot of money.

While Pepi didn't feature much in his return to the USMNT in the November window, he might still beat out Balogun for the starting job on that team too. He has a lot of tools and ways to score. While Balogun is better at getting behind defensive lines, Pepi is more well-rounded and can score in the air.

On Tuesday, Folarin Balogun scored in his third straight Champions League game for Monaco when he was in the right place at the right time in a scramble following a 68th minute corner kick. That was enough to lift Monaco to a 1-0 win over Galatasaray.

THREE CONSECUTIVE #UCL GAMES WITH A GOAL FOR FOLARIN BALOGUN! ?????? pic.twitter.com/UD24POzZdn



Balogun sat out this weekend's 1-0 loss to Brest in Ligue 1 with a minor knock but was able to go 86 minutes against Galatasaray. He limped off but the substitution looked precautionary.

It is shaping up as an interesting comparison between him and Pepi for the U.S. team. There is no doubt they are watching each other and feel pressure to continue to perform.

 

With an impressive 2-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen, Augsburg won for the second time in three games to climb two points out of the bottom three in the Bundesliga. Despite the recent managerial change, U.S. teenage central defender Noahkai Banks continued to start for Augsburg. Given his inexperience and young age, his leash is likely short with the interim manager.

Banks was shaky at the start of the game but grew into the match well and was very good in the second half.

Next weekend, Augsburg travels to face Eintracht Frankfurt in another tough match.

Do not count Banks out of making the 2026 World Cup team for the United States. Pochettino likes him and brought him into the squad in September. Since then Banks has only continued to play for Augsburg. It hasn't always been great, but he's learning very quickly.

If he continues to improve by February, he is in a good position to be the “surprise” pick of the World Cup roster. Regardless, he has a bright future with the United States.

 

You can divide the bad news for American players this past week between injuries and players who didn't play well.

The injury list contained many of the usual suspects: Antonee Robinson, Cameron Carter-Vickers, Caleb Wiley, Damion Downs, Rokas Pukstas, Johnny Cardoso, Aidan Morris, -with Tanner Tessman (who missed Lyon's 1-0 loss to Lorient) joining the list this week. Tyler Adams was suspended for Bournemouth's 0-0 draw with Chelsea.

Cardoso managed to return to the bench for Atletico in Wednesday's Champions League win.

On the performance side, things weren't much better.

Tim Weah did not have a good week. He was held invisible against his former club, Lille, in a 1-0 loss then in the Champions League on Tuesday, he was subbed out at the half of a 3-2 win over Union SG.

Malik Tillman did not do anything positive in 81 minutes for Bayer Leverkusen in its 2-0 loss to Augsburg.

Yunus Musah managed a cameo for Atalanta on Tuesday when he played the final two minutes of a 2-1 win over Chelsea in the Champions League. He was an unused substitute on Saturday in a 3-1 loss to Hallas Verona. Musah is a good example of why players need to be careful with the moves they make leading into a World Cup year. His lack of minutes will likely cost him a spot on the World Cup team given how well many other central midfielders are playing.

Auston Trusty started for Celtic in Wilfried Nancy's debut as coach but Celtic lost 2-1 to surprising leaders Hearts to fall further into second place. Hearts was willing to have Trusty be the Celtic player with the most touches as he wasn't threatening starting the team's possessions. It is tough to gauge where he stands with Pochettino and the rise of Banks certainly makes him on the edge of the player pool for the national team.

Paderborn lost for the third straight game and has tumbled from first to fourth in the 2.Bundesliga. Recent U.S. U-21 midfielder Santiago Castaneda was benched for Paderborn and went as an unused sub.

John Tolkin and Holstein Kiel are only two points clear of the 2.Bundesliga relegation zone after a 1-1 draw with Eintracht Braunschweig. It is not a good situation for Tolkin and it highlights the dangers of joining a team in the relegation zone midway through the season, as he did last year with Holstien Kiel.

Josh Sargent broke his long scoreless skid for Norwich with a goal on Saturday in a 3-2 loss to Watford but was subbed out in the first half on Tuesday in a 1-1 draw with Sheffield United following an aerial challenge. Sargent needs to do whatever he can to get out of Norwich in January. This isn't even an issue involving the U.S. national team. For his own sake, he's beyond being a team sinking to relegation. But here is to hoping he doesn't have another bad injury.

James Sands and St. Pauli fell further into the relegation zone following a 1-1 draw with Cologne (where Kristoffer Lund only played the final two minutes. Sands is only at St. Pauli on loan from NYCFC. It is hard to see that option being picked up if they go down.

 

 

Last week, Terrence Boyd announced he will retire at the end of the current 3.Liga season with Waldhof Mannheim. Interesting timing for Boyd to announce such a move has he has five goals in his last four games, including the winning goal on Saturday in a 2-1 victory over Saarbrucken. Waldhof Mannehim now sit seventh and are three points out of the promotional playoff.

DERBYSIEGER LONGA! Danke an das gesamte Team, unseren Fans für die bombastische Stimmung und einen unvergesslichen Tag @svw07 ???? pic.twitter.com/4seiodo1eV





Boyd, who turns 35 in February, never scored for the U.S. national team but he was one of the most likeable players in the USMNT pool a decade ago, before serious knee injuries setback his career.

Here's to hoping he goes out playing great soccer in a promotion race.

 

 

Weston McKennie had a nice assist for Juventus in a 2-1 loss away to a very good Napoli team. Unfortunately, he also had an assist for Napoli in a mistake that led to the host's winning goal. Aside from those two moments – good and bad - , it was a quiet game.

Still, McKennie remains in good physical shape and still brings difference making to the table. At some point, his constant up and down situation at Juventus is tiresome.

Brenden Aaronson played the final 25 minutes for Leeds United in a 3-3 draw with Liverpool and Leeds scored all three goals after he came into the game. It doesn't always work out, but Aaronson's energy can be contagious at times. Leeds is now two points clear of the relegation zone.

Chris Richards started and was once again quality in a 2-1 away win over Fulham. He is in the best spot for a defender right now, consistently good. He should win U.S. Soccer's Male Player of the Year for 2025.

Haji Wright returned from injury on Tuesday when he started for Coventry in a 1-1 draw with Preston North End. It was a disappointing result for Coventry, but they still sit comfortably atop the Championship table. But it was welcome news to see Wright back.

In the Bundesliga, Borussia Monchengladbach continued their climb into the middle of the table (taking advantage of a run of games against weaker teams) with a 1-0 win over last-place Mainz. Gio Reyna made his first start of the season and played fairly well, but played 69 minutes. It was good for him to build up stamina and take another step forward. Joe Scally played the entire game on the right side of a back three and was strong. Both players are on the bubble of the USMNT right now, but this game was a small step forward for that.

Bryan Reynolds started, scored, and had a very good game for Westerlo in a 4-0 romp over Anderlecht. It was the best game Westerlo have had in a long time. On the other side, Griffin Yow only played the final few minutes and has been having a difficult first half of the season.

England head coach Thomas Tuchel believes his side will benefit from facing high-ranked opponents in Uruguay and Japan during the March international break.

The Three Lions will face Uruguay on March 27 before hosting Japan four days later, with both friendlies taking place at Wembley Stadium.

Both opponents qualified for the 2026 World Cup next summer, with Uruguay currently 16th in the FIFA men's rankings, two spots ahead of Japan.

Tuchel was not only happy with the level of the countries they are set to face, but also their location.

""We are really pleased to have these two fixtures confirmed as our World Cup year takes shape,"" said Tuchel.

""We wanted to play two teams ranked in the top 20 in the world, but also to test ourselves against opponents from outside of Europe.""

England were drawn into Group L at the 2026 World Cup alongside Croatia, Ghana and Panama, who they also faced in the 2018 group stage.

Their match against Japan will be their final game before Tuchel names his squad for the tournament, but the Three Lions are expected to play two further warm-up games in the United States prior to their opening fixture against Croatia on June 17.

Egypt and Iran have complained to FIFA over a World Cup soccer match in Seattle that is expected to celebrate the LGBTQ+ community.

Leaders in the nation's soccer federations publicly rebuked the idea of playing the match on June 26 at Seattle Stadium, which local organizers say will include a “once-in-a-lifetime moment to showcase and celebrate LGBTQIA+ communities in Washington.”

Organizers in Seattle have promoted an art contest for the match, including one entry of a rainbow-flagged sun rising over Mount Rainier as a crab goalie goes for a soccer ball while holding a cup of coffee in its pinchers.

“With matches on Juneteenth and pride, we get to show the world that in Seattle, everyone is welcome,” Seattle Mayor-elect Kate Wilson wrote on social media. “What an incredible honor!”

A World Cup draw in Washington selected the teams and matches last week for the tournament's first round, placing Iran and Egypt as the teams to compete in the game.

In Iran, where gays and lesbians can face the death penalty, Iranian Football Federation president Mehdi Taj criticized scheduling the match during an interview aired on state television late on Monday.

“Both Egypt and we have objected, because this is an unreasonable and illogical move that essentially signals support for a particular group, and we must definitely address this point,” Mehdi Taj said.

State TV on Tuesday confirmed a complaint would be sent to FIFA.

The Egyptian Football Association said in a statement that it had sent a formal letter to FIFA secretary-general Mattias Grafstrom, rejecting “in absolute terms” any activities linked to LGBTQ support during the match.

It said that such initiatives would clash with “the cultural, religious and social values” of Egypt and urged FIFA to ensure the match would solely focus on soccer.

Homosexuality is not expressly outlawed in Egypt, but is often punished under loosely worded laws prohibiting “debauchery.”

Seattle's organizing committee on Tuesday said it was “moving forward as planned with our community programming outside the stadium during Pride weekend and throughout the tournament.”

“The Pacific Northwest is home to one of the nation's largest Iranian-American communities, a thriving Egyptian diaspora and rich communities representing all nations we're hosting in Seattle,” spokeswoman Hana Tadesse said in a statement. “We're committed to ensuring all residents and visitors experience the warmth, respect and dignity that defines our region.”

Frank said he made the decision to sever ties with Paul on Sunday then told the franchise's career assist leader that he needed to see him on Tuesday in Atlanta.

Eduardo Camavinga also found the net for Madrid as they moved back within one point of Barcelona, who beat Atletico Madrid 3-1 on Tuesday.

Real Madrid were coming off league draws against Girona, Elche and Rayo Vallecano. It was their second win in their past six matches in

While Arsenal accelerated their title charge with a 2-0 victory over Brentford to regain a five-point lead, Liverpool needed a late own-goal just to salvage a 1-1 draw with Sunderland AFC at Anfield.

December 10 – Match ticket prices for the World Cup took off like a rocket the moment the draw and schedule dropped, thanks to FIFA's newest gift to world football, namely, dynamic pricing.

At some point you have to wonder when fans will finally push back.

Before matchups were announced, you could get into the June 27 game in Miami's Hard Rock Stadium for under $400. As soon as FIFA confirmed Portugal vs Colombia, the floor price flew past $2,000 within an hour. It touched $3,000 before settling around $2,200, instantly becoming the fourth-most expensive ticket of the tournament behind only the final and semi-finals, because after all, who doesn't want to see the 40-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo playing in his 6th World Cup Finals?

Brazil versus Scotland in the same stadium saw a sharp rise, and the holders, Argentina's three group matches, weren't far behind. Resale prices rose for 78 of the 91 games in the US and Canada.

The bigger story is how normalised FIFA is trying to make these increases, saying it doesn't control the secondary market, but its own ticketing strategy has embraced scarcity and surge logic. You only need to look at the FIFA Club World Cup earlier this year to see the trend. Prices climbed fast there too, especially for games involving big European clubs, and many fans felt squeezed. The World Cup is exposing the same tension but on a global scale.

Maybe supporters swallow it for now because it's a once-in-a-lifetime event. But if FIFA continues leaning into this model, and prices keep behaving like stocks after a good earnings call, it's fair to expect a backlash eventually.

The 10 biggest group-stage increases from Thursday to Sunday afternoon were as follows…Wall Street could only look in wonder and wish!

The ""Futbol Americas"" crew react to USMNT's 2026 FIFA World Cup group draw. (3:17)

Egypt and Iran have complained to FIFA over a World Cup match in Seattle that is planned to celebrate LGBTQ+ Pride.

Leaders in the nation's football federations publicly rebuked the idea of playing the match June 26 at Seattle Stadium, which local organizers say will include a ""once-in-a-lifetime moment to showcase and celebrate LGBTQIA+ communities in Washington.""

In Egypt, the federation issued a statement late Tuesday saying it sent a letter to FIFA ""categorically rejecting any activities related to supporting homosexuality during the match.""

Seattle PrideFest has been organized in the city since 2007 by a nonprofit which designated the June 26 game for celebration before FIFA made the World Cup draw Friday.

FIFA chose Saturday to allocate the Egypt-Iran game to Seattle instead of Vancouver, where the teams' group rivals Belgium and New Zealand will play at the same time.

Already, organizers in Seattle have promoted an art contest for the game, including one entry of a rainbow-flagged sun rising over Mount Rainier as a crab goalie goes for a soccer ball while holding a cup of coffee in its pinchers.

""With matches on Juneteenth and pride, we get to show the world that in Seattle, everyone is welcome,"" Seattle's mayor-elect Kate Wilson wrote on social media. ""What an incredible honor!""

FIFA controls only stadiums and official fan zones in World Cup host cities and should have no formal authority over community events like Seattle PrideFest.

FIFA declined comment Tuesday to the Associated Press, and did not address a question if it would consider switching the Belgium-New Zealand game to Seattle.

Angry response in Iran, Egypt In Iran, where gays and lesbians can face the death penalty, the president of Iran's Football Federation Mehdi Taj criticized scheduling the match during an interview aired on state television late Monday.

Taj said Iran would bring up the issue during a FIFA Council meeting in Qatar next week. The longest-serving member of the 37-person council chaired by FIFA president Gianni Infantino is Egypt's Hany Abo Rida.

""Both Egypt and we have objected, because this is an unreasonable and illogical move that essentially signals support for a particular group, and we must definitely address this point,"" Taj said. State TV on Tuesday confirmed a complaint would be sent to FIFA.

The Egypt federation led by Ado Rida said of the pride celebration it ""completely rejects such activities, which directly contradict the cultural, religious and social values ​​in the region, especially in Arab and Islamic societies.""

It urged FIFA to stop the celebration to ""avoid activities that may trigger cultural and religious sensitivity between the presented spectators of both countries, Egypt and Iran, especially as such activities contradict the cultures and religions of the two countries.""

Iran had threatened to boycott the World Cup draw in Washington, D.C., over complaints about five of its nine-person delegation, including Taj, not getting visas to enter the United States.

Iranians are subject to a travel ban imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration and the U.S. in the past has denied visas for those with ties to Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, like Taj. Iran ended up sending a smaller delegation including the team's coach.

Tensions remain high between Tehran and Washington over Iran's nuclear program, particularly after American warplanes bombed atomic sites in the country during Israel's 12-day war with the Islamic Republic in June. Unlike the 2022 World Cup, however, Iran is not scheduled to play the United States in the World Cup's opening matches.

Asked about the complaint Wednesday, Seattle's organizing committee said it was ""moving forward as planned with our community programming outside the stadium during Pride weekend and throughout the tournament.""

""The Pacific Northwest is home to one of the nation's largest Iranian-American communities, a thriving Egyptian diaspora and rich communities representing all nations we're hosting in Seattle,"" spokesperson Hana Tadesse said in a statement. ""We're committed to ensuring all residents and visitors experience the warmth, respect and dignity that defines our region.""

Though Egypt technically does not outlaw homosexuality, authorities frequently prosecute members of the LGBTQ+ community on the grounds of ""debauchery"" or ""violating public decency.""

Iran also has targeted the LGBTQ community and its theocracy is believed to have executed thousands of people for their sexuality since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Hard-line former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad once famously went as far as to claim during a 2007 visit to the United States: ""We don't have homosexuals like in your country.""

A crowd at Columbia University responded by laughing and heckling the leader.

FIFA risks being accused of a double standard if it sides with World Cup teams' federations over the city of Seattle.

At the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, FIFA fiercely defended the right of the host nation's cultural norms to be respected in full by visiting teams.

A group of European federations wanted their team captains to wear a ""One Love"" armband with some rainbow colors that symbolized human rights and diversity, which FIFA and Qatari officials viewed in part as criticism of the emirate criminalizing same-sex relations. Some Wales fans had rainbow hats removed before entering the stadium.

Glitzy draws, OJ-era chaos, grass laid over AstroTurf and a host nation that barely cared – the 1994 World Cup arrived amid suspicion and slapstick. Yet it became a watershed that would alter US sport and global football politics alike

“The United States was chosen,” the columnist George Vecsey wrote in the New York Times in 1994, “because of all the money to be made here, not because of any soccer prowess. Our country has been rented as a giant stadium and hotel and television studio.” Nobody could seriously doubt that. The USA had played in only two World Cups since the second world war and hadn't had a national professional league for a decade. And that meant there was a great deal of skepticism from outsiders, even after Fifa made it clear there would be no wacky law changes to try to appeal to the domestic audience: Would anybody actually turn up to watch?

But there was also hostility in the United States. A piece in USA Today on the day of the draw told Americans they were right not to care about the World Cup, what it sneeringly described as the biggest sport in “Cameroon, Uruguay and Madagascar”. “Hating soccer,” wrote the columnist Tom Weir, “is more American than mom's apple pie, driving a pickup or spending Saturday afternoon channel surfing with the remote control.”

Behind both, perhaps, lay the same thought. What if hosting the World Cup turned out to be the stimulus the United States needed to embrace soccer? Foreign skeptics perhaps feared too much growth in the United States and possible domination of the global game; American skeptics worried what a soccer boom might mean for the four major US sports. Fifa just hoped there was money to be made.

What nobody doubted was that the United States would bring glitz, glamour, and razzmatazz. The draw was held in Las Vegas and starred such luminaries as Bill Clinton, Faye Dunaway, Jeff Bridges, and Jessica Lange. The opening ceremony, staged at Soldier Field in Chicago before the defending champion Germany – playing at a World Cup as a unified nation for the first time since 1938 – faced Bolivia, was a lavish, sun-drenched affair presented by Oprah Winfrey and featuring turns by Diana Ross, Daryl Hall, and The B-52's. But the omens were terrible. Winfrey fell off the stage and twisted her ankle. Ross dragged a shot wide of an open goal from three yards. Germany won a desultory opening game 1–0. And the whole thing was overshadowed by the LAPD's televised pursuit through Los Angeles earlier in the day of the American football star turned murder suspect, OJ Simpson.

The United States had been awarded hosting rights, appropriately enough, on 4 July 1988. Chile had withdrawn from the race and Brazil had still not installed Havelange's son-in-law, Ricardo Teixeira, as CBF president, which effectively left a straight fight between the United States and Morocco. It was a close-run thing, the United States winning out by 10 votes to Morocco's seven, with Brazil on two. It was the third tournament awarded by the Havelange regime and already the process was drowning in paranoia and suspicion. Had the ban Mexico received from the 1990 World Cup for fielding overage players in a youth tournament been an attempt to smooth the USA's passage to 1994 by giving them tournament experience?

Havelange was certain the United States was a market ripe for exploitation, but even though Fifa talked boldly of hosting the World Cup as a way of stimulating interest in the game, there were plenty of doubters. Would it be possible to lay grass over the artificial surfaces at the Pontiac Silverdome in Michigan and the Giants Stadium in New Jersey? What would the impact be of staging the tournament over such a vast geographical area? And how would players cope in the heat and humidity, particularly with games kicking off at noon and midafternoon to accommodate European TV markets?

More broadly, what did prioritizing potential commercial markets over traditional soccer countries suggest about the way the game was going? The Italian president of Uefa, Artemio Franchi, had been clear he could “never agree to a World Cup for multinationals” and he wasn't the only one who disliked the overtly commercial route soccer was taking under Havelange. He was killed in a car crash in 1983 and there were enough unexplained details about his death to prompt an investigation by the journalist Alberto Ballarin, who identified two untraced foreign motorcyclists as potential suspects in a possible murder. Among the wilder theories about what happened on the road to Siena that night is the claim that elements at Fifa who had seen the USA miss out on hosting 1986 and 1990 took out a key obstacle to the success of their third bid.

Like Colombia, Italy played with a back four and zonal marking, adapting the tenets of Total Football for their own market. And like Colombia, they had a brilliant and radical coach whose rise had been vertiginous. Arrigo Sacchi had been a shoe salesman for his father's factory when, in 1979, aged 33, he quit to devote himself fulltime to coaching. His big break came in the 1986–87 Coppa Italia, when his Parma team, then in Serie B, beat AC Milan, which had just been acquired by Silvio Berlusconi. Berlusconi saw in Sacchi something of himself, a disruptor unbound by convention.

Appointing Sacchi was an extraordinary risk, but one rapidly justified when Milan won the league in Sacchi's first season and followed up with a pair of European Cups. After the first of them, in 1989, Milan faced Atlético Nacional in the Intercontinental Cup. They won 1–0 and Sacchi and Maturana, realizing how much they had in common, began to speak regularly.

Like many who plan meticulously, Sacchi was extremely superstitious. He hated people wishing him luck; to say “good luck” to Sacchi was to lay a curse upon him. The night before Italy began their World Cup campaign against Ireland, the Italian president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro rang to wish the Italy squad good luck. What followed was, to Sacchi's mind, typical: a classic Jack Charlton victory.

One semifinal was played in New Jersey and one in California, which, with the final to be played in Pasadena, was a problem. At Giants Stadium on the East Coast, two early goals from Roberto Baggio effectively secured Italy's win over Bulgaria. But the 2,700-mile journey cost Italy a day of preparation, which Sacchi thought decisive. In the second semi-final, Thomas Ravelli had already made a couple of fine saves before Sweden's captain Jonas Thern was sent off for a studs-up jab on Dunga's ankle. Romário headed the winner with 10 minutes remaining. Determined to avoid the misfortune of a good-luck message, Sacchi instructed reception in the team's hotel in Los Angeles not to put through any calls to him. But at 4am on the morning of the final, his phone rang. It was “a girl from Bologna.” He had no idea who she was, but she uttered the fateful words: “Good luck.” Sacchi knew the game was up.

Baresi made a miraculous recovery from his knee injury to start, but it wasn't enough. Although Sacchi said that “in the defensive phase, we played very well,” he thought they were “mediocre” going forward, for which he blamed fatigue. The game was anxious and drab, ignited only after Viola had come on for Zinho with fourteen minutes of extra time remaining. It finished 0–0 and so, for the first time, a World Cup was settled on penalties.

Roberto Baggio didn't want to go first, so Baresi took responsibility and put his kick over the bar. Marcio Santos and Daniele Massaro both had their efforts saved, which meant that when Baggio stepped up to take Italy's fifth kick, he had to score. He, too, shot over and Brazil had their fourth World Cup.

In Brazil, the day after the final was declared a national holiday, but the players did not return to the adulation that had greeted previous World Cup–winning squads. When customs officials at the airport in Recife tried to get them to pay import tax on goods they'd bought in the United States, the result was a five-hour standoff that was ended only when the finance minister waved them through. A subsequent poll, though, showed that 70% of Brazilians thought they should have paid the duty; players were not the national heroes they had once been.

The final round of group fixtures in Qatar produced immense drama, but with third-place qualifiers, USA, Canada and Mexico risks an underwhelming finale, but Miguel Delaney considers a simple solution

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

For all the absurd political theatre around the World Cup 2026 draw, there was still a sense of “magic” – as Scotland manager Steve Clark put it – as countries began to visualise the tournament. They could see the groups, so they could see the path, so they could see the dream.

It used to be like this with the Champions League, but nobody would really say the competition has any sense of magic during this opening stage. It's quite the opposite. It's all so mundane. Filler.

Tottenham Hotspur beat Slavia Prague on Tuesday night to go up a few places, but does that really matter? The stakes are so vague.

The Champions League group stage has become classic football as content rather than pure competitive sport, as has been discussed on these pages before.

A concern with the 2026 World Cup is that the expansion to 48 teams starts to move it towards this. And this isn't one of those unfair jibes about Uzbekistan against possible play-off qualifiers DR Congo. 

It's that Portugal against Colombia, in the same group, just doesn't have the same sense of peril.

It's simply a fundamental fact that group games will have inherently less tension because of the need to allow eight third-place sides through. There's a much bigger safety net.

Since 48 teams is not a symmetrical number as far as splitting the field to eventually get to a two-team final, Fifa have had to come up with some kind of convolutions to engineer the latter.

And including third-place teams from four-team groups just never works as well. It isn't as clean and, consequently, isn't as tense.

There will be many people reading this and no doubt yelling that this was exactly the format in 1986, 1990 and 1994, which happen to be among the most cherished World Cups of all.

And all of that is true, but there is a difference.

For one, there was a smaller 24-team field in those World Cups, bringing more competitive tension. The unfair and uneven imbalance towards more developed European and South American teams also ensured a higher baseline of quality.

Secondly, two qualifying from four simply works much better. There's just no argument about this. We have demonstrable proof. In 2022, most famously, Argentina lost their first match and were immediately under immense pressure to win the next two, which they did. It was the same with Spain in 2010.

In 1990 and 1994, respectively, both Argentina and Italy lost their opening games but still went through in third place with one win and one draw each.

It's instantly visible that there just aren't the same stakes.

A typical irony is that Gianni Infantino and Fifa recognised some of this at the last World Cup. The Fifa president announced that the 2026 World Cup would not go through with an original idea of three-team groups, because 2022 had shown how electric four-team groups are. Every single one of them went to the wire, with most of them requiring teams to watch what was happening in the other game. This was as pure a sporting tension as you can get.

It is actually galling enough that the figure who holds the highest position in football, the Fifa president, should require the most recent tournament in order to figure this out. Is it not something that any football fan just realises?

And, just as typically, Fifa came up with the wrong solution.

Allowing third-place teams, especially when an expansion dilutes quality, also dilutes the drama that so moved Infantino in 2022.

But there is a better solution, which is partly inspired by the Champions League, ironically enough.

In order to keep the exquisite tension of two teams going through from four – 48 into 24 – why not just allow the eight best group winners to go straight into the last 16, with a play-off in between?

Such an idea would immediately ease many problems from this World Cup's “bloat” in an instant.

Even the issue of first-placed teams fielding weakened sides for final group games when opposition still have qualification on the line would be solved, since they would have the incentive of finishing in the top eight of 12 group winners.

And while one argument is that a mezzanine play-off round may create too long of a wait between games for the best teams, that is no longer as relevant in this calendar. By contrast, a longer mid-tournament break would probably be even more of an incentive, as fatigue takes hold.

As it is, too, the winners of Group A will have a six-day wait between the last group match and the last 32, with the Group L winners facing a mere five-day wait.

Extending this out to seven or eight is hardly a sufficient negative amid the many positives. The actual World Cup calendar could also just be a bit more smartly scheduled.

And if anyone quibbles about the eventual champions only playing seven games rather than the maximum of eight… well, does that actually matter? It's just the prize for finishing best in the first stage, and still makes more mathematical sense for a sports tournament than the current convolutions of third-place qualifiers.

Above anything, a bit more of the old magic would be preserved. The group stage matches – and by extension the whole World Cup – would just have more meaning.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","In KC, an Airbnb spikes to $20,000 a night for FIFA World Cup. See hotel rates","https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article313547695.html","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 12:06:00 GMT","

It is now clear that Lionel Messi, one of the greatest players in soccer history, will be headed to Kansas City with his defending world champion Argentina national team for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Of course, he and all World Cup athletes have places to stay.

The question now is who among soccer's legion of fans — some 650,000 are expected — will nab a room in Kansas City as hotels are filling up. Room prices on short-term rental sites like Airbnb, Vrbo, Orbitz and others are climbing at the speed of a Messi free kick.

One has hit $20,000 nightly.

The tournament in Kansas City runs from June 11 to July 19, with four of six matches at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium already scheduled. They are Argentina v. Algeria (June 16), Ecuador v. Curaçao (June 20), Tunisia v. Netherlands (June 25) and Algeria v. Austria (June 27). Two other matches will be held on July 3 and July 11.

A quick check of Kansas City hotels during that month-long period shows the demand:

The Westin Crown Center Hotel — sold out, a reservation representative said.

The Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center — sold out.

The Lowe's Kansas City Hotel — sold out.

Hotel Kansas City — sold out.

The Marriott Kansas City Overland Park — sold out.

Of those that aren't sold out, many are offering rooms at a premium.

On Orbitz, The Cherry Warehouse Hotel, 2936 Cherry Street, shows it charging $1,102 a night for the first week of the tournament, up from about $188 a night one month prior.

The Hotel Phillips Kansas City, Curio Collection by Hilton, $637 a night. The Ameristar Casino Hotel Kansas City, $738 nightly. Hampton Inn Kansas City-Airport, $799. Embassy Suites By Hilton in Olathe, $499. Best Western Premier Liberty Inn & Suites in Liberty, $626. Drury Inn & Suites in Independence, which in May is at $148 a night, is at $506 during the first week of the World Cup.

The prices of short-term rentals listed on platforms such as Airbnb, Vrbo, Orbitz and others have likewise skyrocketed.

One host, identified at Kristen Doppelt of the company Cozy in KC, lists a three-bedroom “villa” with pool that normally rents for about $450 per night for just over $20,341 per night in the first week of the World Cup.

Doppelt also lists a downtown loft that sleeps two for $8,428 a night, a three-bedroom “cottage” near the stadium for $8,209, and a one-bedroom flat on Forest Ave. in the Columbus Park area of Kansas City, north of downtown, for $4,864. The Star reached out to Doppelt on Tuesday by phone, email and over a rental platform, but did not receive a response.

The City of Kansas City currently lists between 800 and 1,000 short-term rentals on its registry. To meet what the city realizes will be increased demand, the City Council, in November, amended its short-term rental ordinance to allow property owners to pay a lesser fee, $50, to offer short-term rentals for the three-month period, May 1 to July 31, surrounding the event. Applications will be available beginning December 15.

As the tournament approaches, some Kansas Citians have raised concerns over the condition of some short-term rentals, price-gouging, or, at the very least, offering subpar properties for premium prices.

While prices are quickly rising, not all have skyrocketed, depending on one's definition. In Waldo, a three-bedroom house, sleeping six, was listed this week for $993 a night. In south Johnson County, what was advertised as a highly-rated, six-bedroom home, sleeping 16, was running $1,200 a night. A four-bedroom house on Oak Street, just south of Brookside, rated “Exceptional” on Vrbo with reviews of 10 out of 10 by nearly every renter, was still available Tuesday for $1,165 a night.

Bargains, to a degree, can still be found. Even with 650,000 visitors expected, Devin Aaron, a spokesperson for Visit KC, Kansas City's conventions and visitors bureau, is confident that enough rooms will be available.

“I think a good thing to keep in mind is that the 650,000 people won't be here all at once,” Aaron said. “People may be traveling in and out, they may be staying for a day or two, or be here just for a match. I know everyone keeps seeing that number and thinking, ‘Oh, we don't have enough space.' But that will be across the entirety of the tournament.”

Aaron said that in bidding for the World Cup, Kansas City had to prove to FIFA officials that the city had a sufficient number of hotels and other rooms to host an international event of such scale.

“Looking at hotel rooms in teh Kansas City metro, looking out at those other neighborhoods in Overland Park, and Leawood, Bonner Springs and things like that, we are more than confident that there is going to be more than enough housing to go around,” she said. “Especially if people are looking at places further afield, like a St. Joe, which is an easy commute. Places like Lawrence. There will be more than enough for all the demand that we'll have.”

Her advice, still: Watch the market. More short-term rentals are likely to come online soon, as people register. Deals could show up.

“It's always better to do sooner than later,” Aaron said. “I always say, I like to plan ahead. Sooner rather than later is probably their best bet.”

World Cup

A Pride flag is waved at Lumen Field, the 2026 World Cup venue in Seattle Steph Chambers/Getty Images

The FIFA World Cup draw last week produced the group-stage line-ups for next summer's 48-team competition and, subsequently, we learned the schedule, meaning the tournament's host cities in the United States, Canada and Mexico now know which nations will be competing in their stadiums next June and July.

For the host committee of Seattle, in the U.S. state of Washington, this has thrown up an unforeseen challenge because local organizers had been preparing a string of activations to mark Seattle Pride, with the city's parade to promote the rights and freedoms of the LGBTQ+ community usually taking place during the final weekend of June. Indeed, the body had even designated a specific ‘Pride Match' to take place during Pride Weekend, with a World Cup game slated to take place at Seattle's Lumen Field on Friday, June 26.

Yet after Saturday, when the group-stage fixture schedule was confirmed, the Seattle committee encountered an awkward predicament: their Pride Match would be Egypt vs Iran, which would mean a celebration of the LGBTQ+ community as shoulder programming for a game involving two nations that criminalize same-sex relations. This has triggered a backlash from the soccer federations of Egypt and Iran, both of whom immediately sought to halt any link to Pride events.

Here, The Athletic lays out the background, the reaction, what the Pride Match actually entails, and the next steps in a row that is likely to rumble on.

At previous men's World Cups, world football/soccer governing body FIFA used a more traditional model of a single local/national organizing committee for the host nations concerned, such as Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy for the previous edition in 2022. However, for the 2026 men's World Cup, FIFA has instead taken the vast majority of its operations and logistics in-house. This allows FIFA, which has set up offices in Miami, Florida, and New York City, to maximise the commercial benefits of the tournament. There is very little revenue sharing, with FIFA taking all the income from ticketing, broadcast deals, in-stadium sponsorship, and even parking fees.

Yet within that model, FIFA has still allowed for each city staging matches to have its own host committee. These are subsidiaries of the “FWC (FIFA World Cup) 2026 U.S.” entity, which FIFA has established in the United States. It means each of the 16 cities can drum up local sponsorship and arrange programming around the games to produce economic impact for its region. The Seattle FWC26 committee has representation on its board from executives from Seattle Reign FC of the NWSL, MLS team Seattle Sounders FC, the Seattle Sports Commission, and the NFL's Seattle Seahawks, as well as Sounders owner Adrian Hanauer. It also has a day-to-day leadership team.

The Seattle FWC26 committee defined its mission as going beyond the passion for soccer in the Pacific Northwest. On its website, it identifies key pillars. Firstly, it says that as a not-for-profit organization, SeattleFWC26 is “working to deliver a safe, sustainable, and accessible FWC that meets our region's values”. As part of this objective, it says Seattle and the wider Washington State area “value diversity and celebrate the many cultures and communities that make this a special place to live”. It adds that it will “present the (World Cup) games with an inclusive, celebratory energy”.

As part of the Seattle committee's inclusive aims, its website says it established a committee that will plan and execute initiatives relating to the Pride Match. This was scheduled to take place during Pride Weekend in June and had been in the works long before the draw. The weekend of June 27-28 coincides with the anniversary of the Stonewall protests in New York City, which began on June 28, 1969, and is commonly considered to be a seminal moment in the struggle to secure gay rights in the United States.

The sub-committee of the Seattle host committee is called the Pride+ Match Impact Council and appears to have two members. They are Jen Barnes, the founder of Rough & Tumble (a pub which emphasizes screenings of women's sport), and Louise Chernin, who was CEO of the Greater Seattle Business Association between 2002 and 2020.

The Seattle FWC26 website says of the Pride Match: “With hundreds of thousands of visitors and billions of viewers worldwide, this is a once-in-a-lifetime moment to showcase and celebrate LGBTQIA+ communities in Washington, while ensuring meaningful, lasting impacts for local businesses, arts, and organizations.”

It adds that the committee will provide “strategic advice and validate community-informed priorities”, “curate Pride stories and economic opportunities for LGBTQIA+-owned enterprises”,  as well as “shape communications, community activations, and cultural programming”.

The Pride Match is not the only progressive initiative being championed by the Seattle FWC26 host committee. The website also says it intends to mark the United States playing their second group game of the tournament at Lumen Field (which will be officially referred to as Seattle Stadium during the tournament, due to its sponsored everyday title) on Juneteenth against Australia. Juneteenth — Friday, June 19 — is a federal holiday commemorating the official end of slavery in the United States on that date in 1865.

The website says: “Having the U.S. team playing in Seattle on Juneteenth creates a high-visibility, high-responsibility moment to introduce hundreds of millions of viewers worldwide to Juneteenth and to create benefit for local Black-owned businesses and arts and cultural organizations. The SeattleFWC26 Juneteenth Advisory Committee (JMAC) will convene from Fall 2024 through June 2026 to advise SeattleFWC26 as we prepare for the moment — and the responsibility — of hosting the Juneteenth Match.”

The Seattle FWC26 host committee has held design contests to mark both the Pride Match and the Juneteenth Match. Three finalists for the Pride design contest were announced in November, with the committee saying the artists were “selected for their original designs capturing the themes of unity, pride, and the power of sport to bring people together”.

The artwork will be incorporated into a citywide celebration and, it adds, will be a “lasting symbol of Seattle's commitment to inclusion and pride”.

A spanner was thrown into the works when the group-stage draw and subsequent match schedule emerged over the past week, with Egypt's Group G finale against Iran down to be played in Seattle on Friday, June 26 (in the early hours of June 27, European time).

The Human Dignity Trust says the Iranian state criminalizes gay people, as well as same-sex sexual activity, and ultimately imposes a maximum penalty of death under its penal code. It also says Egypt prohibits same-sex sexual activity, with provisions for prison sentences and fines.

There was a significant risk before the draw took place that Seattle could host nations that criminalize same-sex relations. In addition to Egypt and Iran, other World Cup-qualified nations with the same stance include Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Ghana, and Senegal.

In a post on the Egyptian Football Association's X account and statement on its website on Tuesday, the federation said it would refuse “the holding of any activities related to supporting homosexuality” during the game with Iran.

The association added it has sent an official letter to FIFA secretary general Mattias Grafstrom to say it had been made aware of the local committee's planning to hold “some activities related to supporting homosexuality during that match, and that they (Egyptian FA) completely refuse these activities, which directly contradicts with the cultural, religious and social values in the region, especially in the Arabic and Islamic communities”.

The Egyptians warned that such activities “could cause cultural and religious sensitivity between the attending fans of both countries” and must be avoided in order to maintain “the spirit of unity and peace”. They also noted that FIFA's statutes say it ought to remain neutral in political matters and that it should not promote issues the Egyptian FA deems to be “sensitive or divisive”.

The statement concludes: “Therefore, to guarantee the game is played in an environment that prevails respect and focuses solely on the sporting side, the Egyptian FA refuses those invitations and requests FIFA to not hold any activities or shows related to homosexuality-support events inside the stadium on matchday.”

The Iranian Football Federation also appears to have pushed back. Al Jazeera reports that the federation's president, Mehdi Taj, told local news agency ISNA both his country and Egypt had raised “objections against the issue”. He described it as “an irrational move that supports a certain group”.

FIFA is not formally commenting on the matter at this stage, but multiple people familiar with the situation, all of whom wished to remain anonymous as they were not authorized to speak publicly on it, indicated that the body's central headquarters has no role in the Pride initiative. They also said that nothing has been planned within the stadium itself for matchday. The local host committees do not have the power or scope to impose initiatives inside tournament venues, as all World Cup programming is led by FIFA's central HQ.

The programming planned by the Seattle host committee is instead intended to be outside of the stadium perimeter, which is not under FIFA's jurisdiction, rendering the complaints by the Egyptians and Iranians futile.

The broad-brush description of a Pride Match, widely reported by global media, appears to have given the impression there would be an organized Pride feature in Lumen Field, but that was not the case. FIFA allows individual supporters to wear Pride colours or demonstrate representation for the cause within their venues, and it is possible locals who attend the game may wish to do so on a Pride weekend.

The activities planned by the local host committee instead relate to Seattle's broader Pride programming ahead of the weekend, while activities are also on the drawing board for fan festivals, which are under host-city control but overseen by FIFA. It remains to be seen whether the Egyptians or Iranians will seek to take issue with this.

On Tuesday, the Seattle committee showed no signs of backing down.

In a statement to The Athletic, Hana Tadesse, its vice-president of communications, said: “As the local organizing committee, SeattleFWC26's role is to prepare our city to host the matches and manage the city experience outside of Seattle Stadium. SeattleFWC26 is moving forward as planned with our community programming outside the stadium during Pride weekend and throughout the tournament, partnering with LGBTQ+ leaders, artists, and business owners to elevate existing Pride celebrations across (the state of) Washington.

“Football has a unique power to unite people across borders, cultures, and beliefs. The Pacific Northwest is home to one of the nation's largest Iranian-American communities, a thriving Egyptian diaspora, and rich communities representing all the nations we're hosting in Seattle. We're committed to ensuring all residents and visitors experience the warmth, respect, and dignity that define our region.”

Telemundo has launched “Tu Momento. Tu Jugada.,” a national community initiative that will offer youth sports programming, mentorship, and local partnerships in the lead-up to FIFA World Cup 26. Supported by Comcast NBCUniversal, the campaign will travel to eight U.S. cities beginning Dec. 11.

The campaign, also referred to in English as Telemundo's Next Play, is part of the network's broader effort to engage Latino communities through sport and leadership development. Programming includes youth clinics, local festivals, mentorship sessions, and large-scale public viewing events.

The initiative will visit the San Francisco Bay Area, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. through a branded mobile experience tour. The tour will include interactive fan activities, appearances by Telemundo talent, and community events leading up to and during the FIFA World Cup.

“Through Tu Momento. Tu Jugada. we are inspiring youth, creating leadership opportunities, and strengthening grassroots sports while inviting fans everywhere to share their passion for the game,” said Christina Kolbjornsen, senior vice president of corporate affairs at NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises.

The initiative features a digital storytelling series that highlights athletes, coaches, and community leaders, as well as “Café Golazo” community breakfasts convening local stakeholders to discuss investment and opportunity in World Cup host cities. Telemundo will also host large-scale public watch parties for key matches during the tournament.

In partnership with the U.S. Soccer Foundation, Telemundo will expand the Yes, Coach! program. The initiative aims to train 100,000 coaches and reach 3 million youth, supported by a new bilingual platform and a public service campaign airing across Telemundo and Comcast NBCUniversal networks.

“We are proud to partner with Telemundo on Tu Momento. Tu Jugada. to inspire young people, engage families, and strengthen communities through soccer,” said Ed Foster-Simeon, president and CEO of the U.S. Soccer Foundation.

The campaign is part of El Poder En Ti, Telemundo's long-running community outreach platform focused on education, wellness, inclusion, and civic participation. With FIFA World Cup 26 set to take place in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, this effort marks a further expansion of Telemundo's community engagement activities.

Roberto De Zerbi listed a number of areas where Mason Greenwood needs to improve after Marseille's 3-2 victory over Union Saint-Gilloise in the Champions League on Tuesday night. The former Manchester United forward scored twice as the French side held off a late comeback from the Belgians, but the fiery Italian manager wasn't entirely happy with his match-winner.

Marseille had lost three of their five Champions League games this season prior to Tuesday's outing, making the clash with Union Saint-Gilloise a vital one in their bid to reach the knockout stages. Things started badly as Anan Khalaili struck from distance in the fifth minute, but Igor Paixao replied shortly after before Greenwood got his first of the night njust before half-time. The 24-year-old completed his brace with a superb strike in the second half, finishing from Brighton loanee Matt O'Riley's pass, but Khalaili's second effort ensured a nervy finish for the Ligue 1 side. They held on, however, to earn three much-needed points away from home.

Greenwood may have been happy with his performance, but manager De Zerbi insisted more improvement is needed from the former Manchester United striker going forward.

The former Brighton manager told reporters: ""Yes, I think he's one of the best strikers in Europe. But even he, when we're leading 3-1, needs to learn to manage the ball, not to force things and not to lose possession. And that's not an unreasonable demand, which doesn't mean we're not happy with Greenwood. 

""He's a great player, but in those moments, I think he also needs to make the effort to hold onto the ball a little longer, to give us a bit more breathing room, to be more consistent defensively, at least by holding his position.""

Team-mate Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg echoed his manager's thoughts, with the ex-Tottenham and Southampton midfielder adding: ""Sometimes, where he can improve is by playing the game until the end. What he does here for us, for the team, is a huge benefit. He's a great guy, and I think he deserves what he's getting. It's good for us.""

It's not the first time Greenwood has been singled out for criticism by De Zerbi. The Italian raged at the Marseille squad last week after a defeat to Lille, insisting ""one shot on target for a player like Greenwood isn't enough for him"".

It's been a productive season so far for Greenwood. He is the outright leading goalscorer in Ligue 1 with ten strikes, also contributing three assists for his team-mates, while he now has three goals in six Champions League games this campaign. He had endured a lean period prior to Tuesday's win, failing to hit the back of the net in the recent clashes with Newcastle United, Toulouse and Lille, but his midweek showing represented a well-timed return to form. His performances have attracted interest from the Saudi Pro League, with reports claiming a €100 million (£87m/$116m) offer has been put forward for the attacker. If that were to be accepted by Marseille, former club United would be due 50 per cent of the profits.

The victory was a crucial one for Marseille, who have been inconsistent during their first proper Champions League campaign since 2022-23. They have lost to Real Madrid, Sporting CP and Atalanta so far but also previously beat Ajax and Newcastle, with this latest result leaving them in a firm mid-table position of 16th. They have two more games left against Liverpool and Club Brugge, with a few more points needed to guarantee the French side a place in the round of 16 playoffs. Back in Ligue 1, Marseille are five points behind current leaders Lens and four off reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain, with their next match coming against Monaco on Sunday evening. A two-game winless run has seen them drop off the pace, having drawn with Toulouse before suffering defeat to Lille.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Roma have officially opened negotiations with Manchester United regarding a January swoop for Joshua Zirkzee, a report in Italy claims. The Giallorossi are planning to terminate Evan Ferguson's loan spell with the Brighton striker managing just one goal in 14 competitive appearances since joining the Serie A club in the summer.

The January transfer window is fast approaching, and Roma are determined to correct the mistakes of the summer. The capital club's attack has stalled in the first half of the season despite their positive results, prompting sporting director Frederic Massara to take decisive action. According to Gazzetta dello Sport, he has established direct contact with the hierarchy at Old Trafford to discuss bringing Zirkzee back to Serie A.

The Dutch forward, who earned a big-money move to United after a breakout season with Bologna, has found life in the Premier League difficult. Often utilised as a substitute or left on the bench entirely, Zirkzee is reportedly open to a return to Italy, where his stock remains high.

According to Gazzetta, Massara has received the green light from the Friedkin Group to pursue the deal. The sporting director is reportedly planning a ""blitz"" to the UK, using Roma's upcoming Europa League trip to face Celtic as a logistical springboard to finalise discussions with United.

The negotiation will not be straightforward. United are eager to protect their investment and would prefer a permanent sale or a loan with a guaranteed obligation to buy. Roma, operating under financial fair play restrictions, are pushing for a loan with an option to buy, potentially set around the €35 million mark, which could become an obligation if certain conditions are met.

However, the will of the player could be decisive. Zirkzee is understood to be keen on the move, and his profile is viewed as the perfect tactical fit for Gian Piero Gasperini's system. Unlike a traditional poacher, Zirkzee's ability to drop deep, link play, and orchestrate attacks mirrors the role Gasperini has successfully used with forwards in the past at Atalanta.

The urgency to recruit Zirkzee is a direct consequence of the failure of Irish striker Ferguson. He arrived on loan from Brighton in the summer with high expectations, tasked with providing the goals to fire Roma into the top four. Instead, his tenure has been a nightmare.

Ferguson has made 14 appearances across all competitions and registered a single goal - against Cremonese last month. His performances have been described by the Italian press as ""ghost-like,"" with the striker struggling to adapt to the physicality and tactical rigours of Serie A.

Reports suggest that the upcoming match against Como in Serie A represents a ""last call"" for the 21-year-old, but the decision appears to have already been taken. Roma are preparing to terminate the loan agreement in January, sending Ferguson back to Brighton early to free up the squad space and wage budget necessary to register Zirkzee. It is a harsh conclusion to what was meant to be a developmental step for the young Irishman, but Roma's precarious league position leaves no room for sentiment.

While Zirkzee is the undisputed ""Plan A,"" Massara is keeping his options open should negotiations with United hit a wall.

According to reports, Roma have identified Mathys Tel as a viable alternative. The former Bayern Munich prodigy is also struggling for game time since his summer move to Tottenham and could be available on a loan deal. The French forward offers versatility and pace, traits that appeal to the Giallorossi scouts.

Furthermore, domestic options remain on the table. Giacomo Raspadori is a player Gasperini has admired for years, though extracting him so soon after he left Napoli to join Atletico Madrid will be no easy feat. Finally, Fabio Silva is on the shortlist as a ""wildcard"" option amid his struggles since making a summer transfer from Wolves to Borussia Dortmund.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Real Madrid boss Xabi Alonso is under increasing pressure after a tough start to life back in the Spanish capital, with reports going so far as to claim the Los Blancos boss could be sacked if his side lose to Manchester City in the Champions League on Wednesday night. But is dismissing the former Madrid midfielder the right decision?

According to reports, the hierarchy at Madrid have held a meeting over the future of their head coach and offered no guarantees that Alonso will remain in the job if the club's form does not improve. The Spanish giants have forfeited their lead at the top of La Liga, and now sit four points behind champions Barcelona. That is despite beating the Blaugrana 2-1 in the first El Clasico of the season back in October. With the pressure now ramped up, Alonso faces arguably his toughest test yet - Pep Guardiola. 

The City boss is certainly not going to take it easy on his fellow countryman, and he refused to be drawn into speculation about his future. Guardiola said: ""I wish Xabi all the best, but his future is an answer I don't know. You all know the situation better than I do; I'm far removed from it. I haven't spoken with Florentino, and he hasn't told me that tomorrow will be Xabi's last match. If you don't win big games, things get difficult. But Xabi is in control of the situation and knows what this whole thing is about. My concern is seeing what we've done well. To beat Real Madrid in this competition, it's not enough to be better; you have to be much better.""

Alonso has a proven track record. He led Bayer Leverkusen to their first-ever Bundesliga title and their biggest success since claiming the 1993 German Cup. The 44-year-old then had the whole of Europe at his doorstep, begging him to join, but he chose Madrid, the club he represented 158 times during his career. There is no doubt that he is a world-class coach, and it would benefit Los Blancos to loosen the weight of expectation during his first term as manager. Understandably, it is not always that simple in Madrid, and failure is very rarely rewarded; however, despite their run of just one win in their last five games in La Liga, four points is not an insurmountable deficit to overturn in the second half of the season, and the club are better off putting their trust in Alonso, rather than ripping his project up and starting again.

One of Alonso's biggest threats is managing the ego-driven squad Madrid currently possesses. Sometimes, too many big personalities can cause more harm than good, and given time, the Spaniard can drive out the unwanted crop and replace them with players he knows will thrive in his system. Fans have already seen him clash with Vinicius Junior, but Alonso must also contend with the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Rodrygo, Jude Bellingham and Endrick. Three of the five mentioned have been linked with moves away from Madrid; perhaps that is the action needed to give the manager a stronger grip over his team.

Arsenal are the ultimate example of a club who are being rewarded for their patience and trust in the process. Madrid are not exactly battling relegation, although you could argue that with the quality of their team, challenging on all fronts is the bare minimum. After a few short months, it is incredibly hard to gauge an idea of how well things are going under new leadership, especially when that person is taking over from Carlo Ancelotti, a man who was given four years to deliver, and did not always manage it. If Madrid fans can take anything away from the opening months of the 2025-26 campaign, let it be the big wins rather than the losses. Victories over Barcelona and Juventus are clear indicators of what the team can be; it might just require a bit of patience in the short-term.

Ex-Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur icon Gareth Bale has revealed the real reason why he announced his retirement from football at the age of 33. The former winger brought the curtains down on his illustrious professional career just months after Wales were knocked out of the 2022 World Cup group stage after finishing bottom with just a point from their three matches.

Bale started his professional journey at Southampton in 2006 after graduating from the Saints' youth system. After an impressive debut campaign at St Mary's Stadium, the wide man caught Tottenham's attention and the north London club snapped him up. He spent the next six seasons at White Hart Lane, before completing a dream move to Real Madrid for a then world-record transfer fee.

In Madrid, he won every major trophy on offer, including multiple La Liga and Champions League titles. In 2022, Bale joined MLS side LAFC where he spent a season before hanging up his boots in January 2023. His retirement announcement came in the aftermath of Wales crashing out of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar in the group stage.

In a chat with GQ Magazine, Bale revealed how his father's ill health prompted him to quit football at just 33. He said: ""I feel incredibly fortunate to have realised my dream of playing the sport I love. It has truly given me some of the best moments of my life. My dad got ill and that played a massive role in my decision. People don't know what anyone's going through at home but I soon realised there's more to life than just football. [My dad] sacrificed everything when I was younger. He took me everywhere. Without my dad and my parents, I wouldn't be where I am today.""

He added: ""I achieved so much in my career so playing in a World Cup was pretty much the last thing that I wanted to achieve. It didn't go amazingly well for us, but it was the first time in 64 years. After that, I didn't feel like I had anything else left to achieve, goal-wise.""

During his time in Madrid, Bale had once held aloft a now-infamous flag which read 'Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order' after his nation qualified for Euro 2020. The incident did draw some criticism in Spain and since the former Wales international has been closely associated with the sport, with many believing that he is obsessed with golf.

However, later in the interview, the Spurs icon cleared the air as he claimed he ""never used to play golf that much"" and would only pick up his clubs ""once every two to three weeks"" - and always ""on a day off"".

Speaking about his relationship with former Madrid team-mate and Portugal icon Cristiano Ronaldo, the Welshman said: ""I'm not really in touch with that many [old Madrid team-mates] – a few of the Wales boys – but I always got on with everybody. I never had any problems with anyone. I never had any big arguments. Sometimes the media might say about me and Ronaldo, we never had an issue, never had an argument, never had a fight, never had anything.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Xabi Alonso has taken a massive gamble on Kylian Mbappe as the Frenchman has been included in the Real Madrid squad to face Manchester City in the Champions League on Wednesday night. The manager is fighting to save his job in the Spanish capital and needs a positive result to ease the pressure. Mbappe missed training on Tuesday due to an injury, but is still in line to feature against City at the Bernabeu.

Mbappe, who has been the club's talisman this season, sat out Tuesday's public session alongside compatriot Eduardo Camavinga, prompting speculation about whether the forward would be available for selection. Spanish radio outlet Cadena Cope reported that Mbappe had suffered a problem in his left leg, which further spread panic among fans. But Real boss Alonso has moved to quash the uncertainty by including the 26-year-old in the official matchday squad, confirming he will at least take a place among the substitutes at the Bernabeu.

Mbappe has been Madrid's heartbeat in the 2025-26 campaign. With 25 goals across all competitions, plus four Champions League assists, he is on track to surpass Cristiano Ronaldo's record for most goals (69) in a calendar year for the club. In La Liga, he has been responsible for half of Madrid's total goals, and a scarcely believable 75 per cent  in Europe. His last Champions League outing was a four-goal masterpiece against Olympiacos, underlining both his brilliance and Madrid's reliance on him. 

Alonso's decision to include Mbappe in the squad comes at a moment when his own position is under intense scrutiny. Madrid's 2-0 home defeat to Celta Vigo on Sunday was catastrophic, extending a bleak run of just two wins in seven matches across all competitions. The loss was compounded by two red cards, shown to Alvaro Carreras and Fran García, and a serious muscle injury to centre-back Eder Militao, who is expected to be sidelined for up to four months. The result widened the gap to Barcelona at the top of La Liga to four points and ignited further speculation that Alonso's reign could be terminated if City inflict another damaging defeat. Reports in Madrid suggest this match, against Pep Guardiola's side, may be his final chance to steady a season veering off course. 

However, a defiant Alonso is not ready to throw in the towel. He said: ""We are all in the same boat. We have to go through positive and negative times. We need to believe the next game is an opportunity, and tomorrow we have a very exciting game for all of us, and we need to keep our eyes open to have that energy so the Bernabeu enjoys what it sees. Communication [with the board] is constant. We are united, we are all together in this, and I have a good relationship with them.""

With Mbappe missing training and doubts lingering over his physical condition, Alonso spent Tuesday working closely with teenage forward Endrick. The Brazilian, who has struggled for minutes since arriving in the summer, received special tips from the manager, which indicated that he could play a meaningful role against City. Marcadubbed the tactical contingency ""Plan Endrick"" with the 18-year-old expected either to start or come from the bench for his first appearance since November 1. Gonzalo García, who has featured more regularly this season, is another attacking alternative if Mbappe is unable to lead the line. But the focus remains firmly on the Frenchman. Without him at full tilt, Madrid's prospects appear worryingly diminished.

Whether Mbappe will feature from the start is still unknown. Alonso, under enormous pressure and staring down a make-or-break moment in his turbulent reign, may yet opt to gamble on the fitness of a player who has carried his team almost single-handedly through the season. He is already missing several defenders like Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dean Huijsen, Dani Carvajal and Militao as Madrid's back line has been ravaged by injury. Hence, it was no surprise when midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni acknowledged the challenge of containing City's attacking threat, especially that of Erling Haaland. 

""If we don't win games, it's because we have to do things better with and without the ball, with commitment from everyone and play better in defence and attack. We hope to improve and win more games because what's happening now cannot go on,"" he said.

""We're all together. If we want to win games, we all have to fight, coach and team in the same direction. It's us who are on the pitch, and we have to do things better out there. We have a good opportunity to change the dynamic and pick up more points in the Champions League.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Bayern Munich left-back Alphonso Davies has made an emotional return to competitive action after a torturous nine-month injury nightmare. After coming off the bench during the Champions League victory over Sporting CP to rapturous applause from the Allianz Arena faithful, his team-mates lined up to praise the Canadian's mental resilience during his 261-day rehabilitation.

The 3-1 victory over the Portuguese champions will be remembered for Lennart Karl's record-breaking goal, but for the squad and the supporters, one of the night's biggest cheers was reserved for the 88th minute. Standing on the touchline, ready to replace Serge Gnabry, was Alphonso Davies - a sight many feared might not happen until 2026 given the severity of his knee injury.

The 25-year-old had not featured for the Bavarians since tearing his anterior cruciate ligament while on international duty with Canada in March 2025, and his senior team-mates were quick to highlight the extraordinary attitude the full-back maintained during his darkest days.

Speaking to reporters in the catacombs of the Allianz Arena after the final whistle, captain Joshua Kimmich offered a candid insight into the mental toll such an injury takes on a player. The midfielder admitted that he was unsure if he would have possessed the same fortitude as his team-mate to remain positive throughout the ordeal.

""The way I experienced him, how he went through rehab, that is exemplary. I wouldn't have managed it like that with this energy,"" Kimmich enthused, clearly moved by the return.

The German international went on to reveal details of how the Canadian kept himself integrated with the squad despite being unable to train, highlighting a specific role he played alongside fellow injury-hit star Jamal Musiala.

""He also always tried to be close to the team,"" Kimmich continued. ""He has been with us in the dressing room for months, comes to the games, comes into the dressing room together with Jamal, turns on the music, tries to create a good mood. That is not something to be taken for granted.""

Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who knows all too well the pain of long-term injuries having battled back from a serious leg break himself in the past, was equally effusive in his praise. The veteran shot-stopper emphasised that the defender's absence was felt not just tactically, but emotionally within the dressing room, and offered some sage advice for the next steps of his recovery.

""It is naturally a hard time,"" Neuer reflected. ""I know that because I have also had severe injuries and I believe for him it is now very important that he stays cool and appreciates this joy of playing football and that he is with us in the team.""

Neuer added: ""We obviously also hope that he will remain healthy, but he did it superbly, even during that time.""

Defender Jonathan Tah, who marshalled the backline effectively against Sporting, pointed to the unseen hours of work that made the comeback possible. Speaking in the mixed zone, he summarised the collective relief felt by the squad.

""I am very happy for him that he is back,"" Tah stated. ""I believe it was a hard path of suffering that he had to walk and we are all happy that he is there again.""

For the man of the moment, the reaction was simple and heartfelt. Taking to social media after the game, Davies posted a message on Instagram, capturing the relief of finally doing his job again.

""Good to be back! Doing what I love the most,"" he wrote.

With the 2026 World Cup on the horizon - a tournament his nation is co-hosting - his return to fitness is a massive boost not just for Bayern, but for Canadian football as a whole. For now, however, he will simply enjoy the feeling of grass under his boots and the applause of the Allianz Arena.

Anticipation is building for the 2025 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, and this year's contenders know the track record is impossible to ignore.

The 20-and-under showcase has evolved from a glimpse of potential into a springboard for future champions, highlighted by names who have already reshaped the sport, such as Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, the current World No. 1 and No. 2.

The field for the eighth edition features Learner Tien, Alexander Blockx, Dino Prizmic, Martin Landaluce, Nicolai Budkov Kjaer, Nishesh Basavareddy, Rafael Jodar and Justin Engel, all chasing a trophy that now comes with prestige.



Sinner set the precedent in 2019, when he captured the title at the age of 18 and climbed to No. 1 five seasons later — becoming the first Italian to do so in the history of the PIF ATP Rankings. He has since amassed four major titles, offering early proof that the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF could be a powerful stepping stone, but Alcaraz's story raises the bar slightly further.

The Spaniard also lifted the trophy at 18 — in the 2021 edition — and needed less than a year to become the youngest World No. 1 in history after winning the US Open in 2022 at 19 years and four months. Alcaraz, now a six-time major champion, has ensured that the leap from the #NextGenATP stage to the very top is undeniably possible.

Last year in Jeddah, Joao Fonseca provided the most immediate recent example of fast progress. The Brazilian, who became just the third 18-year-old to triumph at the 20-and-under event, cracked the World's Top 25 by claiming two ATP Tour titles in 2025, the season that directly followed his Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF debut.

Sinner, Alcaraz and Fonseca have reshaped how the event is perceived, but they are part of a broader picture rather than a guaranteed equation. Daniil Medvedev, who competed at the inaugural event in 2017, took a different route — slowly but equally deliberate — before lifting the US Open trophy in 2021 and rising to World No. 1 in 2022. Stefanos Tsitsipas won the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF in 2018 and then triumphed at the Nitto ATP Finals on his debut just 11 months later.

Last year's finalist Tien has already experienced a powerful surge of his own. The American has climbed to a career-high No. 28 in the PIF ATP Rankings in 2025, highlighted by five wins over Top 10 players and his first ATP Tour title in Metz.

For Spaniards Landaluce and Jodar, the pathway is theirs to define, but the inspiration is immediate. Both have received advice from Alcaraz, while Landaluce has also benefitted from guidance at the Rafa Nadal Academy — insight that may not promise success, but helps soften the unknown that awaits.

This year's field arrives not with certainty, but with evidence in view that the journey from the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF stage to the top of the sport is possible. For eight rising talents, Jeddah represents the first big test of whether possibility can become greatness.

Ricardas Berankis, the highest-ranked Lithuanian player in history, announced his retirement from professional tennis on Tuesday via a post on X.

“Today is one of those days that seems like it will never come, but when it does, it touches me very sensitively and deeply,” wrote the 35-year-old. “I want to announce that I have made one of the most difficult decisions of my life – to end my professional tennis career.”

Berankis reached a career-high No. 50 in the PIF ATP Rankings in 2016 and finished his career as a two-time finalist on the ATP Tour.

“Twenty-five years is not just a number. It is a life path, a childhood dream of reaching the heights of tennis that I have been following,” Berankis continued. “This stage passed in a moment, but at the same time it left an unimaginable amount of excitement, struggle, victories, painful experiences, lasting memories, and acquaintances that will accompany me for the rest of my life.”

Berankis won the US Open boys' title and the Orange Bowl Tennis Championships in 2007 — the same year that he rose to No. 1 in the ITF Junior World Rankings. Along with reaching two ATP Tour finals in Los Angeles in 2012 and Moscow in 2017, he also captured a tour-level doubles title in Houston in 2015 with Teymuraz Gabashvili.



“There were ups. There were downs. These experiences have shaped me as an athlete and as a person,” Berankis wrote. “Every story has its beginning and its end… Today I am closing one of the most important chapters of my life, and I do so with peace and gratitude.

“I thank everyone who was there for me – my family, friends, coaches, teammates, sponsors, partners, fans, and everyone who believed in me, supported me, encouraged me, and helped me get back up when things were the hardest. My faith and your support were my driving force.”

Justin Engel will make his debut at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF and become the first German to compete at the 20-and-under event.

Engel grabbed headlines with his quarter-final run at the ATP 250 on home soil in Stuttgart in June. By winning his first-round match at the grass-court event — at 17 years and eight months old — he became the second-youngest player, after Rafael Nadal, to claim a tour-level win on all three surfaces (since 1990). Last year, the German won a tour-level match on hard courts in Almaty, and in May, he earned a victory on clay in Hamburg.

Engel then carried that momentum into a career-best stretch on the ATP Challenger Tour between September and November, posting a 12-7 main-draw record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, including his first title in Hamburg. With that triumph, he made history as the first player born in 2007 to lift a Challenger trophy.

Justin Engel is set to make his debut at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF following the withdrawal of Jakub Mensik on medical grounds.

Starting in 2026, Mercedes-Benz will anchor the WTA's top tournaments as its Premier Partner and Exclusive Automobile Partner, a partnership designed to elevate the player and fan experience while supporting the tour's broader ambitions around global reach and women's empowerment.

STUTTGART, Germany -- The WTA and Mercedes-Benz on Wednesday announced they have entered into a new, long-term partnership, representing a powerful commitment to women's tennis and a shared vision for the future of tennis. The “WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz” partnership will begin from January 1, 2026.

The common goal of both the WTA and Mercedes-Benz is to give women's tennis even greater visibility and accelerate its strong worldwide growth. As the Premier Partner and Exclusive Automobile Partner of the WTA, Mercedes-Benz will be present at WTA 1000, 500 and 250 tournaments from 2026, and aims to create unique experiences for players, fans and guests. The partnership underlines Mercedes-Benz's ambition to elevate sport on a global stage and its commitment to empowering women, inspiring the next generation of players and fans.

Marina Storti, CEO of WTA Ventures, commented: “We are truly excited to welcome Mercedes-Benz as the Premier Partner of the WTA Tour. This long-term partnership represents a shared vision and a powerful commitment to the future of women's tennis, and we look forward to working together to grow the sport.

“Securing such a strong and trusted partner is a pivotal moment for WTA Ventures as we continue our journey to accelerate the growth of the WTA as the stage where women's tennis shines, and Mercedes-Benz -- synonymous with timeless elegance, innovation and an uncompromising dedication to excellence -- perfectly aligns with this ambition. We are proud to join forces with such an exceptional brand as we enter this exciting new era for women's tennis.”

Mathias Geisen, Member of the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG, Marketing and Sales, said: “Tennis has always been close to our hearts at Mercedes-Benz -- a sport defined by dedication, responsibility and self-confidence. As worldwide premier partner, our new long-term partnership with the WTA reflects our strong commitment not only to the sport, but also to the values it represents.”

The partnership with Mercedes-Benz, which has been agreed with the WTA's commercial arm, WTA Ventures, is the most significant in WTA history, and continues the WTA's strong growth momentum across the 2025 season, including growing engagement from fans worldwide, the launch of a bold new brand identity, and the award of the biggest-ever prize money payout in the history of both professional tennis and women's sport (awarded to Elena Rybakina, singles champion at the 2025 WTA Finals Riyadh presented by PIF).

As well as championing its incredible athletes, the WTA uses its platform to deliver positive impact beyond sport, inspiring the next generation and supporting communities worldwide with advocacy and action for women's health and empowerment.

By becoming the Premier Partner and Exclusive Automobile Partner of the WTA, Mercedes-Benz is expanding its global presence on the highest level of international sport, building on its long-standing tradition in tennis. The partnership was officially announced at a press conference at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart today.

Attending speakers included WTA founder Billie Jean King, tennis legend Andrea Petković, Marina Storti - CEO of WTA Ventures, Mathias Geisen - Member of the Board of Management, Mercedes-Benz Group AG, Christina Schenck - Vice President Digital and Communications, Mercedes-Benz AG, and Valerie Camillo - Chair of the WTA, as well as Mercedes-Benz brand ambassadors and tennis stars Roger Federer, and Coco Gauff, who joined virtually.

Billie Jean King, founder of the WTA, commented: “From the day we founded the WTA, our mission was to ensure that every girl, every woman, could have a place to compete, be recognized for her accomplishments and make a living playing the sport she loves.

Seeing a global brand like Mercedes-Benz stand with us sends a message that echoes far beyond tennis. It says women's sport matters and our athletes deserve to be seen, heard and given a global platform to shine and inspire. I am incredibly proud to see the WTA carrying our vision forward with purpose and passion.”

WTA Chair Valerie Camillo stated: ""Mercedes-Benz has long embraced the brand promise of 'the best or nothing.' It is significant that one of the world's most iconic brands sees that same commitment to excellence in our athletes, our Tour and our vision for the future. With Mercedes-Benz, we look forward to a new, defining era of women's tennis.""

Christina Schenck, Vice President Digital & Communications and Head of Investor Relations, Mercedes-Benz Group AG also said: “Our partnership with the WTA celebrates women who are redefining the future of sport -- on and off the court. Their dedication and relentless pursuit of progress reflect our own commitment to innovation. By supporting their stories on a global stage, Mercedes-Benz aims to inspire new talent, engage fans and customers worldwide, and demonstrate what human potential can achieve.”





 WTA
                        

The partnership with the WTA will make the Mercedes-Benz star shine once again on the biggest stages in tennis. The star will be present at approximately 30 tournaments in 2026, with even more planned from 2027, and will debut on the net post sign at the Mubadala Abu Dhabi Open (United Arab Emirates) and Ostrava Open (Czech Republic) from February 1-7, 2026.

On site, Mercedes-Benz will provide an exclusive fleet of vehicles for players, officials and guests and will enable a unique driving experience at each tournament.

With the WTA partnership and new brand ambassador Coco Gauff, Mercedes-Benz is underlining the impact of tennis as a global platform and its commitment to women's sports.

Leading global sports, music and entertainment company, Wasserman, through its U.S. Rights Sales team, acted as sales agent to WTA Ventures through the deal process, with additional support provided by IMG, the global sports marketing agency.

Starting in 2026, Mercedes-Benz will anchor the WTA's top tournaments as its Premier Partner and Exclusive Automobile Partner, a partnership designed to elevate the player and fan experience while supporting the tour's broader ambitions around global reach and women's empowerment.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Season showdown in Abu Dhabi

How The 2025 World Drivers' Championship unfolded

The Austrian is set to depart Red Bull after 20 years, having overseen six Teams' titles and eight Drivers' titles.

Red Bull's Motorsport Advisor Helmut Marko will leave his role with the Formula 1 squad at the end of the year, the energy drinks firm have confirmed.

Marko has played a key role in the Red Bull Junior Programme and advised the operation regarding which drivers to bring through to Formula 1 with Racing Bulls and subsequently Red Bull.

During his two-decade affiliation with the company, he has overseen the progression of 20 drivers to Formula 1, including Max Verstappen and Sebastian Vettel who went on to win eight world titles between them when driving for Red Bull.

Arvid Lindblad is the most recent graduate, with the British racer stepping up to F1 with Racing Bulls next season.

Following the conclusion of the 2025 campaign, Red Bull have announced Marko will leave the team six months after Team Principal Christian Horner departed.

""It is very sad news that Helmut is leaving us,"" said Team Principal Laurent Mekies. ""He has been such an integral part of our team and of Red Bull's entire motor racing programme for more than two decades.

""This is therefore the end of a remarkably successful chapter. His departure will leave a void, and we will truly miss him.

""I would like to express my sincere gratitude for his unwavering support, not only over the past months, but also during my early days at Scuderia Toro Rosso.

""On a personal note, Helmut, along with [CEO] Oliver Mintzlaff, was the driving force behind bringing me back into the Red Bull family, first in Faenza and then this summer in my current role in Milton Keynes.

""Helmut is a real racer at heart, always pushing us to the limit, always prepared to take risks in pursuit of our goals.""

""I have been involved in motorsport for six decades now, and the past 20-plus years at Red Bull have been an extraordinary and extremely successful journey,” said Marko himself. “It has been a wonderful time that I have been able to help shape and share with so many talented people. Everything we have built and achieved together fills me with pride.

“Narrowly missing out on the World Championship this season has moved me deeply and made it clear to me that now is the right moment for me personally to end this very long, intense, and successful chapter.

“I wish the entire team continued success and am convinced that they will be fighting for both world championship titles again next year.“

Oliver Mintzlaff, Red Bull's CEO of Corporate Projects and Investments, added that: “Helmut approached me with the wish to end his role as motorsport advisor at the end of the year. I deeply regret his decision, as he has been an influential figure for more than two decades, and his departure marks the end of an extraordinary era.

“Over more than 20 years, Helmut has earned incomparable merits for our team and the entire Red Bull motorsport family. He played a decisive role in all key strategic decisions that made Red Bull Racing what it is today: a multiple world champion, an engine of innovation, and a cornerstone of international motorsport.

“His instinct for exceptional talent not only shaped our junior program but also left a lasting impact on Formula 1 as a whole. Names like Sebastian Vettel and Max Verstappen stand for the many drivers who were discovered, supported, and guided to the very top under his leadership. His passion, his courage to make clear decisions, and his ability to spot potential will remain unforgettable.

“After a long and intensive conversation, I knew I had to respect his wishes, as I gained the impression that the timing felt right for him to take this step. Even though his departure will leave a significant gap, our respect for his decision and our gratitude for everything he has done for Red Bull Racing outweigh it.

“Helmut Marko will be deeply missed, both personally and professionally. We wish him all the very best for the future and hope that he will remain closely and warmly connected to the team.”

Red Bull have been prolific in backing young racing talent and supporting them on their journey to Formula 1 – and Marko should take a lot of credit for that.

He was the one who pushed Red Bull's founder Dietrich Mateschitz to give Verstappen his F1 debut in 2015 – ensuring that it was the energy drinks firm who got the Dutchman's signature rather than Mercedes.

He was the one in constant contact with junior formula teams trying to sniff out the next big thing.

He was the one who would sit down with the aspiring driver face-to-face, one-to-one and decide there and then whether or not they had what it took to deliver race wins in Formula 1 for the Red Bull family.

The impact has been impressive and long-lasting. Seven of the 20 drivers on this year's grid have come through the Red Bull Junior Programme – Verstappen, Alex Albon, Carlos Sainz, Isack Hadjar, Liam Lawson, Yuki Tsunoda and Pierre Gasly.

But nothing lasts forever – and Marko's departure is just the latest step in Red Bull's evolution.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Season showdown in Abu Dhabi

How The 2025 World Drivers' Championship unfolded

Mercedes Team Principal Toto Wolff reflects on the Silver Arrows finishing second in the Teams' Championship.

Mercedes secured second place in the Constructors' Championship behind winners McLaren courtesy of George Russell's fifth in Abu Dhabi. It meant the Silver Arrows finished 18 points ahead of Red Bull – but while team boss Toto Wolff was pleased, he was not over the moon with the race itself.

Russell started fourth but lost places off the line courtesy of some wheelspin, and from there struggled for pace and could not catch up to the back of Charles Leclerc ahead to challenge for fourth or even the rostrum.

Kimi Antonelli had an even more frustrating race down the order, finishing well out of the points in 15th place. But Russell's points were enough to ensure Mercedes ended the season with that P2 in the Teams' Championship, despite Max Verstappen winning the race for Red Bull.

“Our race can be summed up in one word: mediocre. It was a lonely one for George who wasn't threatened from behind but didn't have the pace of the front four cars,” Wolff explained.

“He was managing his tyres to bring the car home on the one-stop, and he did that successfully. For Kimi, he tried his best from a difficult starting position, but we just didn't have the speed in the car to enable him to get back into the points.

“It is not the way we wanted to end the year, but we can be pleased we secured P2 in the Constructors'. Since the midpoint of the season, that has been our aim.”

McLaren were runaway winners of the Championship, scoring 833 points to Mercedes' 469. It leaves Mercedes without a Constructors' crown since 2021, but they did at least improve on last season's fourth-place finish.

“It is not what we as Mercedes ultimately want to be fighting for though, and hopefully we can prove ourselves worthy of being in a world title fight next year,” Wolff concluded.

Mercedes can at least point to the fact that Russell took two wins in a season dominated by McLaren and Verstappen as a positive, along with the introduction of rookie Antonelli to a full-time race seat, with the teenager having some standout performances towards the end of the year and taking three podiums.

But with the regulations set to change for 2026, it remains to be seen if Mercedes will start the next era as strong as they did with the dawn of the turbo-hybrid era in 2014.

Gutman will report for CBS Morning, CBS Evening News, contribute to 60 Minutes and serve as the lead correspondent for 48 Hours. He'll also be a substitute anchor as needed; Gutman's new role begins on Jan. 5, 2026, and will be based in Los Angeles.

He has a sharp news sense, an acute ability to deliver immersive storytelling, and a deep appreciation of history that will be an asset to all of us.” “I am thrilled to be joining CBS, a network with TV news' most storied past, and most exciting future. With Bari and Tom at the helm our mission is to tell the most important news stories and bring our audience along with us to places they wouldn't otherwise be able to go, to give a voice to those who might otherwise not be heard, and to tell it straight,” Gutman said.Gutman began his journalism career as a freelance print reporter in the Middle East, covering the war on terror. He has since earned Emmys, the Edward R. Murrow Award, The duPont, the Gracie Awards and the NABJ awards. Gutman is a graduate of Williams College in Massachusetts.

The 28-year-old is about to close a banner year that brought mainstream global success and three Grammy nominations: “It's been the craziest year of my life.”

Yungblud has always been unapologetically himself, but over the last year, the 28-year-old musician has fully formed into the British rockstar he's longed to be. 


	It's a Tuesday morning in November and Yungblud, born Dominic Harrison, is early to this Zoom conversation, strumming on a guitar as he waits. It's a rare moment of rest for a performer who doesn't, by his own admission, know how to not give everything 100 percent.




	Yungblud's spent much of this last year touring, and he'll spend much of 2026 doing the same. He released a full-length album, Idols, in June and recently teamed up with Aerosmith for a joint EP, One More Time, that was released in November. In between tours and album releases, Yungblud put on his second year of Bludfest, a U.K. music festival aimed at being accessible and inclusive for all fans.

	The grueling schedule is impressive but presumably takes a toll on any performer. Days before this conversation, Yungblud announced to his fans on social media that he was canceling a handful of shows that remained in 2025 at the suggestion of his doctor. The rocker assures that overall he's doing OK.

Idols has been a career-defining moment for the Doncaster, U.K., native — one of several throughout 2025. The album brought him two Grammy nominations in the best rock album and best rock song categories. His third Grammy nomination came from a moment that very well might've changed the course of his career: his live performance of Black Sabbath's “Changes” at the Back to the Beginning benefit concert, honoring the late Ozzy Osbourne and serving as his last show.

	











	“That was probably the moment — I think it was bubbling — but I think the world started paying attention after that,” Yungblud tells The Hollywood Reporter. The live performance, recorded for the upcoming concert film, Back To The Beginning: Ozzy's Final Bow, earned Yungblud and his fellow collaborators a nomination for best rock performance. It's a special nomination for many reasons; first, due to the fact that a live recording was nominated, and second, due to Yungblud's own personal relationship with his late idol, with whom he'd grown close with in recent years.


	Below, the British rocker speaks with THR about finally making the album he wanted to make with Idols, wrapping his head around scoring three Grammy nominations and how he's feeling after his health-related show cancellations.


How's everything going right now? How are you feeling?


	I'm good. I mean, I'm just kind of sat here comprehending the fucking year. At the start of this year, I was filming a [music] video in the Bulgarian snow for “Hello Heaven, [Hello],” and now I'm sat here. It's been the craziest year of my life, so I think I'm just trying to catch it all. It's been wild to end the year with what looks like two No. 1 albums in the U.K. My first number one in America, three Grammy nominations and 400,000 tickets sold has just been like, whoa. I'm pretty shocked.


What's the emotion going through your head when you find out you're nominated for a Grammy? What does it mean to get this recognition?












	What's cool about the Grammys is [it's] from your peers. I think in the past, the internet or music critics have had a lot to say about me. But when you get, I don't know, recognized or even noticed by your peers — the people who write music, produce music, play music — that's a cool thing. Any musician starts as a fan first, don't we? When you're a fan of other people's work, it's cool. This year, a lot of my heroes have kind of hit me up [told me they] really loved what [I] did. This album, it feels so beautiful [to have it be] to be recognized in that way because I really took a risk on it.


In what way?


	At the end of my last record, I was really unhappy because I felt like I'd not completed what I set out to do. As a result of that, I really went away and wanted to make a piece of music and a body of work that would be such an adventure and would be so off the wall and so against the rules of modern music. I just wanted to take a risk, even if it was the end of my career. It's so funny, isn't it? When music is a roulette table, when it's red or black, and you don't know and you're nervous and you're scared, I really think you've made something great. I think that's how rock music's supposed to be made. It's been amazing to arrive at this destination at the end of the biggest risk of my life. I can't believe it. I had an idea, that I thought would be great, and to see people respond to it is really cool.


You've spoken in the past about how you felt you had to infuse a lot of other influences in the music you were making, not just the straightforward rock that Idols is. Something has obviously shifted for you in terms of mainstream perception lately. Does it feel almost like a vindication knowing that this is the music you've been wanting to make, and it's working out?












	I think that's always the case isn't it? You watch any documentary of any great musician that you love and they go, “I finally did what I wanted, and it all worked.” It's so crazy. I don't know why. As artists, we go and do all this shit and experiment and listen to other people because every single great artist in every documentary tells us that they did that. Then they flip the switch, and it all worked. You've got to be lost to figure out who you are. You've got to be running away from something to realize that you're running towards something also. I'm truly myself right now, so people can formulate a decision whether they like me or not. Less people are on the fence.


	Some kind of mainstream recognition has come across me. I think with it all, the mainstream is a crazy place because it's not safe. When you're in your own cult, it's safe and it's all positive. The way you handle the mainstream is if you are yourself or not. If you're yourself, you can get out of bed in the morning if people don't like you. If you're not, then you're hiding. If people don't like you for being something you are not. It is the worst feeling in the world.


I've heard you say in interviews that you don't get to pick how people perceive you, and that's something I ask nearly every artist I speak with. You likely have the version of yourself you want people to see. Do you feel that's what this is for you? Do you feel you're at that place?


	I really think I almost learned enough in the eight years I've been doing this to approach this album and really make people see who I am without a translucent… It's a pure, neat whiskey version of who I am. This album, it's been amazing and the music I'm about to make is going to be a continuation of what I just made. I think people have been deterring me from doing rock music for forever because it's not been around for years. It's not been around for 15 years minimum. I've got to make what my fucking soul wants to make, even if it is the end of my professional career, because I can't handle the fact that I am… It's the most frustrating thing in the world when you can't go the full way. You're running 80 meters on a 100-meter sprint. The last 20 meters is diluted or deterred or caged by another person's opinion. I'm like, why the fuck? Why? You want to run the whole way. There's nothing more liberating. Now I've ruined everything, and I think I finally found some freedom.

	











I'm sure it helps in terms of authenticity and creativity.


	It doesn't hurt as much. It hurts more to make it, but it doesn't hurt as much when people digest it or judge it because it's fucking art, man. If you make a record from your head and people patch you out, it hurts. If you make a fucking record from your soul and your heart and people hate it, you can't really do much about it.


You got what you needed out of it.


	Yeah, man, it's like you fucking explode. Remember that film, Eight Mile, when they do that rap battle? He goes in his verse, “Yeah, I am from a fucking trailer and you did fuck my mom.” Then the guy has nothing to burn him on. He's just like, this is who I am. I think that's the greatest art. When you can kind of have the courage to do that, then nothing can burn because you've already laid it all on the table. There's no skeletons in your closet.


To go back to the Grammys for a second, how are you feeling about the fact that “Changes” got a nomination? I assume that's a pretty special feeling for you at this moment in time.


	That was probably the moment — I think it was bubbling — but I think the world started paying attention after that. I watched that back, and I don't know what the fuck came over me there. It's so amazing that it got nominated for rock performance, as actually the only live performance in the category. I think it's cool that something has got critically acclaimed for me, just telling the guy who got me into music and started everything for me that I love him. I was saying thank you. Honestly, when I left the stage, I did not expect it to ignite that much. I knew it was magic, and I knew that we came together — it's such a crazy moment. I felt like I was in a movie. I feel like I walked out to 50,000 people, half of 'em didn't know who I was. Half of 'em were probably wondering why the fuck I was there, or some of them probably didn't like me. That concert brought six generations of rock fans together, and I think it was the first time people had something in common with me. Like, oh, fuck, man, [he] just likes Sabbath. He just likes Ozzy, like me. I just tried to give it everything. It was the first moment that I've ever… I'm fucking riddled with ADHD, so when you're standing on stage with 20,000 people, you're like, oh look, there's a sign there and oh, there's a girl on her shoulders' there. You're seeing a million things in lights. It's like an ADHD person's fucking nightmare. I really centered [myself]. It was the first time I've ever sung a piece of music to one person.

	











Really? In front of such a large audience too.


	Fifty thousand people. I can't remember it. I went into this, I don't know, this weird, transformative state. I was like, I'm just going to really reach down to the depths of an incredible song and the depths of my very being and try to make something magic out of it. To be Grammy-nominated for a live performance is probably every performer's dream, every singer's dream. I think it's not a performance on record when I could do 20 takes of it, when I got 20 goes of it, when I got to do drop-ins and when I got to do overdubs. It was a moment in time that happened, and it could never have been the same again. It was just a moment in time that was and never will be again. I think that's beautiful about it.


You've been very open about your own mental health and your struggle with finding your own identity, which can be a bit of a taboo thing in rock. Why was it so important to you?


	It's just what I write about. Since the beginning of my career — I'm very bubbly and light, but I'm extremely dark inside my head. That is what captured a generation's imagination. When I came out, I think I came up on a wave with great artists like Billie Eilish and Mac Miller and Lil Peep, and that's what I think caught a generation's heartbeat. It's because the internet came along. The murmurs of school and the pressures of everything where you can't truly say how you feel, but then someone does it on the internet and another person does it on the internet and then it starts to become a normal thing. I think inevitably art is written about the world that we're living in.

	











	I just feel like it was needed. I'd watched people who I loved die. I'd watched Chris Cornell; I'd watched Chester [Bennington]; I'd watched Kurt Cobain and had watched Amy Winehouse, and how sad is it that a time wouldn't allow them to have an outlet to potentially talk about what was going on in their head. It's about 2018, 2019 when it started to be normal to be like, yo, I don't think I'm OK. Or be normal to be like, I need to take a break from touring for a second. I think it's so sad that those artists had to face that and be up against the mood of the world. I think that changed. I sing about my head, I sing about how I feel. It's the one thing I know that's real. In the same way that I'd sing about sex, or I sing about love or I'd sing about anything. In the same way that we sing about something that's tangibly so emotionally overwhelming, anxiety, depression and a feeling being overwhelmed and exhaustion is also that kind of thing.


You're very busy with touring, and unfortunately, you had to cancel some shows at the end of the year. How are you feeling? How do you take care of yourself in that way? 


	I think the fundamentally cool thing about me and my fanbase is I am completely honest with them. I basically just went and had some tests done, and I'm showing early signs of exhaustion in my voice. There's no crazy fucking damage to it, but it's had a really hard year. This album is hard to sing. My instinct is to go and go and go and run and run. My doctor, I've known him for a long time, since I've been very young, he's said it's finally to a place where I need to start taking this seriously. [I'm] not just a 17-year-old young punk anymore who can do a shot of whiskey and say fuck it. I want to be the best for my community. I have a big touring year next year, so I just made the decision that we were obviously going to play support to [Limp] Bizkit and [at] festivals. We had three shows in America. My doctor just [didn't] want [me] on planes and playing shows over two hours right now. He [said] if [I] want to write songs or want to kind of decompress and hit the studio, [he] said he'd have no issue with that. I'm zero or 100. That's just who I am. It was amazing how everyone was nice. Everyone's so supportive, and I think that's what's so beautiful about my community.

	Christmas is a time for giving, and sharing. But one unexpected gift from Gwen Stefani, some critics say, should come with a “return to sender” tag.


	The No Doubt singer is partnering with prayer app Hallow, a move that blindsided many of her decades-long fans.

	In a sponsored post earlier this month, Stefani promoted the service which is said to enable its users to get closer to God, for a monthly or yearly payment plan.

	“It is important this holiday season to spend time in prayer. That is what Christmas is all about: letting God into our hearts and letting Jesus bring us his peace,” says Stefani, dressed in all-white and wearing a crucifix. “Download Hallow and join me and millions of others in praying every day this advent and Christmas season on Hallow.”

	











	Stefani captioned the “paid partnership” post with the comment, “The season of Advent has always been a reminder to slow down, even when everything around us is moving so fast. It's such a special time to reflect, pray and make room in your heart for Jesus.”




	Since launching the promotion Dec. 2 on Instagram, Stefani's post has captured more than 19,000 likes, and almost 2,000 comments.


	Many are critical, none more so than “A Bit Fruity” podcast host Matt Bernstein, who pointed out that Hallow costs $70 per year, includes prayers and meditations that carry anti-abortion messages, and has connections with Vice President JD Vance and conservative venture capitalist Peter Thiel.


	“It's the most wonderful time of the year,” says Bernstein, “aka when Gwen Stefani shills for the right-wing anti-abortion pay-to-pray app, Hallow.”


	Describing the service as a “pay to pray” app, Berstein says its creators have gone and recruited “everyone's favorite Hollaback Girl. More like Hallow App Girl.” 


	Berstein sounds off, “if you're looking for God this season, you don't need to give these people $70 to find him. And Gwen Stefani, don't you have enough goddamn money already?”


	Their post has accumulated almost 280,000 likes and 6,000 comments, including one from Selling Sunset star Chrishell Stause, who wrote in the comments section: “Gwen-DON'T SPEAK, a reference to No Doubt's 1996 hit. “Please take your own advice on this one.”


	The timing of Stefani's collaboration could prove to awkward. Stefani and No Doubt are reuniting for a residency next year at the MSG-owned Sphere in Las Vegas, As previously reported, an initial stretch of 12 shows were booked — and swiftly sold-out — for May 2026.  Another six have been added for next June, which are billed as “final” dates of the residency.

The band's co-founder issued a rare mea culpa after weighing in with his theories about what caused the former KISS guitarist's death at 74 in October.

	Gil Kaufman



	Gene Simmons has offered a mea culpa for his hurtful theory on what caused the death of his beloved late KISS bandmate guitarist Ace Frehley. “On reflection, I was wrong for using the words I used,” Simmons tweeted early Wednesday morning (Dec. 10). “I humbly apologize.”

	The rare retraction from the bassist/singer known for his bombastic, no-filter statements came after Simmons, 76, ruffled some feathers by claiming that “bad decisions” caused Frehley's death at 74 in October. “He refused [advice] from people that cared about him – including yours truly – to try to change his lifestyle. In and out of bad decisions. Falling down the stairs — I'm not a doctor — doesn't kill you. There may have been other issues, and it breaks my heart,” Simmons reportedly told The New York Post following Frehley's death, which was attributed to injuries suffered during a fall the month prior.

	At the time, Simmons appeared to suggest that Frehley's death was possibly tied to the guitarist's long struggle with alcoholism, despite Ace reportedly being sober for more than 20 years before his death. “The saddest thing — you reap what you shall sow unfortunately,” Simmons said at the time.




	But, upon reflection, and following some backlash from fans at what they deemed an unkind final gesture from the teetotaling bassist, Simmons respectfully walked back his earlier statements. “My hand to God I didn't intend to hurt Ace or his legacy but upon rereading my words, I see how it hurt everyone,” Simmons wrote. “Again, I apologize. I've always loved Ace. Always.”


	At the time of his death, Frehley's family issued a statement that read: “We are completely devastated and heartbroken. In his last moments, we were fortunate enough to have been able to surround him with loving, caring, peaceful words, thoughts, prayers and intentions as he left this earth. … Reflecting on all of his incredible life achievements, Ace's memory will continue to live on forever!”


	The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band also remembered their founding guitarist, who they called the “essential and irreplaceable rock solider,” adding, “We are devastated by the passing of Ace Frehley. He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history. He is and will always be a part of KISS's legacy. Our thoughts are with Jeanette, Monique and all those who loved him, including our fans around the world.”


	Simmons issued his own personal post on X as well, writing, “Our hearts are broken. Ace has passed on. No one can touch Ace's legacy. I know he loved the fans. He told me many times. Sadder still, Ace didn't live long enough to be honored at the Kennedy Ctr Honors event in Dec. Ace was the eternal rock soldier. Long may his legacy live on!”; KISS were honored at the 2025 Kennedy Center Honors over the weekend.

	











	Frehley co-founded KISS with Simmons, singer/guitarist Paul Stanley and drummer Peter Criss, performing with the band from 1973-1982, before leaving for more than a decade, then returning in 1996 for a reunion tour through 2002.


	See Simmons' apology below.

On reflection, I was wrong for using the words I used. I humbly apologize. My hand to God i didn't intended to hurt Ace or his legacy but upon rereading my words, I see how it hurt everyone. Again, I apologize. I've always loved Ace. Always.

The Hot 100 top 10 hit also makes gains at top 40 radio and adult R&B airplay, among others.


													By
												

	Trevor Anderson



Kehlani achieves a first No. 1 as lead artist on Billboard's Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart as “Folded” crowns the listed Dec. 13. The single, released and promoted through Atlantic Records, ascends from the runner-up spot after becoming the most-played song on U.S. panel-contributing mainstream R&B/hip-hop radio stations for the tracking week of Nov. 28 – Dec. 4, according to Luminate. For its coronation week, “Folded” improved 2% in plays compared to the prior frame.

	











	As “Folded” enters the summit, it unseats Chris Brown's “It Depends,” featuring Bryson Tiller, from the top after a nine-week reign. The former champ slips one rung after shedding 2% in weekly plays.


	Prior to “Folded,” Kehlani landed in the Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay penthouse via a feature on Cardi B's “Ring,” which ruled for one week in November 2018. As a lead artist, Kehlani's previous best showing was a No. 2 result for “Beautiful Lies,” a collaboration with Yung Bleu, in March 2022.




	In addition to “Folded,” Kehlani claims two more songs on this week's Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart. They once again support Cardi B, but this time on the rapper's “Safe,” which slides 7-8 on the chart (down 11%) after it peaked at No. 3 last month. Plus, Kehlani's own “Folded” follow-up, “Out the Window” pushes 32-30 in its third week on the chart thanks to a 9% jump in weekly plays.


	Elsewhere, “Folded” continues to make impact across a slate of airplay charts. It earns a fifth frame at its No. 2 high on the audience-based R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart, where, despite settling for a silver medal again, it increased 1% to 21.1 million in audience listenership for the week. A former Rhythmic Airplay champ – it headed the list for a week in October – “Folded” backtracks 7-8 at that format (down 2%), but improved in plays on Adult R&B Airplay (up 13% for a 23-21 rise) and Pop Airplay (up 1%, though it reverses 30-31 in rank).


	With its combination of leading support from the mainstream R&B/hip-hop and rhythmic sectors, plus the building results from adult R&B and mainstream top-40 pop stations, “Folded” repeats at its No. 9 best on the all-genre Radio Songs chart. There, it added 2% more in audience impressions for the tracking week, up to 36.1 million.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


The New York Times defended a recent story that examined Donald Trump‘s reduced public schedule and “signs of fatigue,” as the president has claimed that the outlet was being “seditious, perhaps even treasonous” in their reporting on him.”


	On Tuesday evening, Trump posted a lengthy defense of his stamina and broadside at the Times, writing that the media “like to pretend that I am ‘slowing up,' am maybe not as sharp as I once was, or am in poor physical health, knowing that it is not true, and knowing that I work very hard, probably harder than I have ever worked before. I will know when I am ‘slowing up,' but it's not now! After all of the work I have done with Medical Exams, Cognitive Exams, and everything else, I actually believe it's seditious, perhaps even treasonous, for The New York Times, and others, to consistently do FAKE reports in order to libel and demean  ‘THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.' They are true Enemies of the People, and we should do something about it.”

	











	The Times appeared to hit a trip wire with Trump with its Nov. 25 story, which reported that Trump, 79, “has fewer public events on his schedule and is traveling domestically much less than he did by this point during his first year in office, in 2017, although he is taking more foreign trips. He also keeps a shorter public schedule than he used to. Most of his public appearances fall between noon and 5 p.m., on average.”

	The Times also noted an Oval Office appearance where his “eyelids drooped until his eyes were almost closed, and he appeared to doze on and off for several seconds.” Since then, journalists have pointed out moments when Trump's eyelids appeared to be closed as cabinet members spoke at a lengthy meeting. 


	Nicole Taylor, a spokesperson for the Times, said in a statement, “Americans deserve in-depth reporting about the health of the leaders they elect. Mr. Trump welcomed our reporting on the age and fitness of his predecessors; we're applying the same journalistic scrutiny to his vitality. Our reporting is heavily sourced, based on interviews with people close to the president and with medical experts. We won't be deterred by false and inflammatory language that distorts the role of a free press.” 

	











	Trump made Joe Biden‘s age a central focus of his 2024 campaign for reelection, branding his rival “sleepy Joe.” While reporters covered Biden's age issue extensively, there has been plenty of consternation among journalists that they took his administration's assurances at face value. Biden's feebleness was on full display at the CNN presidential debate, alarming Democrats and leading to his decision to exit the race weeks later.


	White House reporters have since been under some pressure to apply the same scrutiny to Trump's aging that they did to his predecessor. Last November, Trump became the oldest person ever elected to the presidency. 


	Trump's post from Tuesday:

Donald J. Trump Truth Social Post 09:11 PM EST 12/09/25There has never been a President that has worked as hard as me! My hours are the longest, and my results are among the best. I've stopped Eight Wars, saving many millions of lives in the process, created the Greatest…

NYT:  “As you can see from the evidence…” *waves at…everything*

people over 60 years old should be banned from running for president.

Shhh…Taco Don is sleepy.

We have all seen sleepy Donald doze off at multiple events during his 2nd term. And he looks physically unwell.

This is why you don't elect a reality tv celebrity president.  Entertainers are desperately insecure.

But we don't live in a country with dignity and self respect anymore, so, we won't remove a president who screams that someone is committing treason for saying that he's getting old.

Jesus Christ.

This Trump term is the best presidency of my lifetime, but I think Vance's 8 years will be even better.

Hi Putin.

Thanks Comrade!

Indeud.  SAD!

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	With the Sundance Film Festival heading to Boulder, CO, in 2027, it's leaving its Park City, Utah home of 44 years with nothing less than a bang and a lot of heart.


	But there will be a lot of laugh for next year's edition, the lineup for which was revealed Wednesday morning. The selection features a big footprint from comedy films including Olivia Wilde's The Invite, David Wain's Gail Daughtry and the Celebrity Sex Pass, Eleanor Wilson and Alex Huston Fischer's Wicker, Cathy Yan's The Gallerist, the John Wilson documentary The History of Concrete, Josephine Decker's Chasing Summer, Macon Blair's The Shitheads, Casper Kelly's Buddy, and a Judd Apatow and Neil Berkeley documentary about stand-up Maria Bamford. Major studios can't pump out comedies for the big screen, hence it's left to the independent filmmakers to fill the void.

	“Independent filmmakers are exploring comedy as a way to explore personal stories,” Eugene Hernandez, Director, Sundance Film Festival and Public Programming tells Deadline. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Part of Sundance's goodbye to Park City include several restored festival classics and reunions (which are still being assembled), i.e. the ultimate 2x Oscar winner Little Miss Sunshine, Gregg Araki's Mysterious Skin, New Line comedy House Party, Lionsgate's original Saw, Ryan Fleck's Ryan Gosling-Anthony Mackie movie Half Nelson, and the late Lynn Shelton's Humpday to name a few. 


	Coincidentally, there's a small nod to Utah itself before Sundance leaves town: the Abby Ellis directed documentary The Lake which has a logline that reads “an environmental nuclear bomb looms in Utah.” And, of course, it wouldn't be Sundance without hot political topics melting the snow, i.e. the Focus Features docu The A.I. Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist from Navalny filmmaker Daniel Roher; the American Doctor about three American medics — Palestinian, Jewish and Zoroastrian– and their work in Gaza; the Mexican border female drama The Huntress, and the docu Everybody to Kenmure Street which follows the dilemma of immigrant deportations in a small Scottish neighborhood. 

	











	In addition to the huge 105 projects selected for their 2026 lineup, Sundance 2026 will pay homage not only to its longtime snowy mountain home, but also to its late founder Robert Redford who passed on Sept. 16 at 89 years old. As previously announced, Redford will be remembered on night 2 of the festival during its Gala Celebration. 


	In addition, there's a screening of the 1969 Robert Redford movie Downhill Racer from director Michael Ritchie; a movie in which the former played a cocky U.S. team skier. It was a title close to Redford's indie soul. 


	“Downhill Racer was a film he would talk about often at the Director's Brunch when he'd gather all the filmmakers from that year's festival, and talk to them about his difficulties in obtaining an independent vision and protecting the integrity of a project, which he produced in addition to starring in. It connected him with the filmmakers at each year's festival. We felt in all his extraordinary body of work, that was the film that was most connected to Sundance,” said John Nein, Sundance Film Festival Senior Programmer and Director of Strategic Initiatives.


	“The 2026 Sundance Film Festival will be a truly pivotal and memorable moment as we celebrate artists and their visionary works, honor our Sundance Institute founder, Robert Redford, and his transformative vision, and show our gratitude to Utah by commemorating our collective journey,” said Amanda Kelso, Sundance Institute Acting CEO. “We are eager to once again foster connection and creativity as we champion and share independent storytelling with audiences. This marks an especially defining year of coming together as a community to uplift independent film and the legacy of the Festival.”


	Added Hernandez, “The program broadly so perfectly embodies the spirit, the history and the vitality of what this festival has tried to bring to Park City and Salt Lake City and the state of Utah for the last 40-plus years. You see in the program some familiar names and faces, but also that 40% of the films are coming from first-time feature directors.”


	“The program for the 2026 Festival invites audiences to experience intimate character journeys, deeply human stories, and compelling explorations of stories from around the globe,” said Kim Yutani, Sundance Film Festival Director of Programming. “Each year, we have the privilege of introducing distinctive storytellers to audiences, and we are grateful to the artists who entrust us with their films at the start of the journey. The upcoming edition will be especially profound in introducing brand-new works while concurrently marking the significance of the many films we have been fortunate to present and gone on to have a long-lasting impact on independent film and culture.”


	Despite film festival markets being in a bit of funk lately, with sales occurring slower and closing outside events, more than 65% of the Sundance line-up is for up for sale. Hernandez says that figure is “consistent” with previous years. Two of the big sales last year included NEON's pick-up of the Dave Franco-Alison Brie horror movie Together and Netflix's high teens acquisition of the Joel Edgerton period drama Train Dreams, which is a buzzy title in this year's awards season mix. 


	Aside from Focus Features' The A.I. Doc, those titles arriving to the festival with distribution attached include ESPN's Give Me the Ball! and The Brittney Griner Story in Premieres, Netflix's Queen of Chess in Premieres, Searchlight's In the Blink of an Eye in Premieres, NatGeo's Time and Water in Premieres, HBO Doc's When a Witness Recants in Premieres, A24's Nuisance Bear in U.S. Doc Competition, PBS American Masters' American Pachuco: The Legend of Luis Valdez in U.S. docs, A24's undertone in Next, ITVS' Jaripeo in Next, Black Bear's Tuner (which played TIFF) in Spotlight, and Amazon MGM Studios' Bait in episodic. 

	











	The 2026 Sundance Film Festival program was curated from 16,201 submissions from 164 countries/territories, including 4,255 feature-length films. From these feature film submissions, 1,676 were from the U.S. and 2,579 were international. The seven episodic projects were selected from 470 submissions.

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


	Here's your good-looking first trailer for Billie Eilish‘ 3D concert film Hit Me Hard And Soft, co-directed by James Cameron and Eilish, and set to be released by Paramount on March 20, 2026.


	Described as “an innovative new concert experience”, the film will chart Eilish' latest hit tour. Avatar director Cameron claims in the trailer that “no one has ever shot a concert film on this scale before” and that “we're using tech no one has ever used before”. He also asks Eilish about “carrying a lot of pain” with her during the tour. Pic is a Lightstorm Earth, Darkroom Records and Interscope Films production.

	The film follows the singer's previous concert film Live at the O2 back in 2023, however, that was only a limited release. Eilish is now targeting IMAX, large format and other cinemas on a bigger scale and will be hoping to come close to the success of the Taylor Swift: Eras Tour movie which made $180.7M domestic, $261.6M worldwide.




			Watch on Deadline		







	It's been a while since Paramount released a concert film in theaters. One of the more notable ones in the millennium was the 2011 Justin Bieber: Never Say Never 3D concert movie which racked up $73M at the domestic box office (after a $29.5M opening) and close to $100M worldwide.


	Cameron has Avatar: Fire and Ash coming out on Dec. 19. Talk about an opportune time to trailer his Eilish concert movie before millions.


Hit Me Hard and Soft is Eilish's third studio album. At the 67th Annual Grammy Awards earlier this year, the album and its songs received a total of seven nominations, including Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, Song of the Year and Record of the Year. At the 68th Grammy Awards on Feb. 1, 2026, the single “Wildflower” from the album was nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year.

SEO Staff Writer


	Save April 3, 2026 as the date for A24's The Drama starring Zendaya and Robert Pattinson. The film's first trailer is here.


	Directed by Kristoffer Borgli, the film watches Zendaya and Pattinson, a happily engaged couple, get tested when their wedding week goes off the rails thanks to an unexpected turn.


	The clip opens on an awkward-looking Emma Harwood (Zendaya) and Charlie Thompson (Pattinson) getting some photos taken ahead of their wedding. The photographer senses “some nerves” and tries posing them next to each other against a gray backdrop, asking them to smile like they would in life.

	











	As the photographer asks each part of the couple their favorite things about the other, a montage of their daily life flows as Charlie calls Emma “beautiful” and “funny” and says she has “the best life.” Emma, in turn calls Charlie “caring, understanding and open-minded,” the last word landing during a shot of her slapping Pattinson's character in the face during sex.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“Remember, you know each other really well,” the photographer says, encouraging the pair to hold onto those thoughts. Mamoudou Athie makes a toast at their wedding, an alarm blares in a dark entryway, Pattinson's Charlie throws a chair and then can be seen saying “just some drama” on the street before Zendaya's Emma chugs some brown liquor.

	The film also stars Mamoudou Athie, Alana Haim and Hailey Gates.


	A24 posted what looks to be a physical Boston Globe announcement for “the wedding of the year” on Instagram, which ends with the movie's release date and date of the wedding. The posting reads that Emma's father, “a decorated military veteran” is proud to share the news of their engagement. Emma's parents live in Louisiana, and Emma studied English at Boston University. Charlie has a Ph.D in art history from Tufts University and serves as the director of the Cambridge Arts Museum.

Zendaya is always solid

This looks weird and not in a good way.

Why so early? In regard to awards I mean. Do they think their chances are slim here!?

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


Tony Dokoupil will be the next anchor of CBS Evening News, one of the first major moves made at the network under new editor in chief Bari Weiss.


	He will start in the role on Jan. 5.


	Dokoupil will succeed John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois, who announced their departures after less than a year anchoring the broadcast. 


	Dokoupil has been co-host of CBS Mornings since 2019.


	Dokoupil's selection comes after reports that Weiss was interested in other figures, like Anderson Cooper and Bret Baier, taking a major role at the network. But Cooper recently re-signed with CNN, and Baier is under contract through 2028.

	











	Dokoupil will be the sixth anchor of the nightly broadcast in the last decade, following Scott Pelley, Jeff Glor, Norah O'Donnell, Dickerson and DuBois. The network has tried various changes over the years to draw in viewers, but CBS Evening News has remained a distant third to its broadcast rivals.




			Watch on Deadline		







	At 44, Dokoupil will be the youngest of all of the broadcast anchors. NBC recently transitioned to Tom Llamas, 46, who succeeded Lester Holt earlier this year as anchor of NBC Nightly News. ABC's World News Tonight with David Muir, 52, has long led in the ratings.


	The network said that in his first month, Dokoupil will take a cross-country tour.


	In a statement, Weiss said, “We live in a time in which many people have lost trust in the media. Tony Dokoupil is the person to win it back. That's because he believes in old school journalistic values: asking the hard questions, following the facts wherever they lead and holding power to account. Americans hungry for fairness will see that on display night after night.”

	











	No successor was named to Dokoupil's role at CBS Mornings, in which he has co-hosted with Gayle King and Nate Burleson. On that show, Dokoupil has reported from Israel on the Oct. 7 terror attack and the hostage release deal; covered the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, TX; and was on the scene for coverage of the wildfires in Maui and Southern California, among other assignments.


	Last year, Dokoupil was at the center of internal friction in the news division over the way that he conducted an interview with author Ta-Nehisi Coates. King and Burleson also took part in the interview, but Dokoupil drew criticism for the way he pressed Coates on the section of his book, The Message, that criticizes Israel's treatment of Palestinians. Dokoupil, who is Jewish, challenged Coates on whether he believed the state of Israel had a right to exist.


CBS News brass addressed the matter during a staff call, featuring Adrienne Roark, then president of editorial and newsgathering, and Wendy McMahon, then president of CBS News and Stations. They told employees that Dokoupil's questioning did not meet the news division's “editorial standards.”


	But Shari Redstone, then chair of CBS-parent Paramount, later called it a “mistake” for CBS News to publicly rebuke Dokoupil. She described the interview as a “model” of “civil discourse.”


	Weiss's The Free Press, which published an audio version of the Roark-McMahon call, defended Dokoupil. Roark and McMahon departed the network before Skydance took over Paramount, and later purchased The Free Press as Weiss became head of the news division.


	In a statement, Tom Cibrowski, president of CBS News, said that Dokoupil “is what everyone wants in an evening-news anchor – authentic, compassionate, unafraid,. He connects instantly, whether he's talking with world leaders or with families navigating difficult news in their own backyards.”

Not only is he the next anchor, but he will also be the next former anchor! CBS could save some bucks by using an AI anchor. Maybe Tilly Norwood?

I thought they wanted better ratings but it seems they just wanted the evening news to be as bland as possible. Hope the ratings continue to free fall

Bari Weiss is such a joke.

I don't want to say anything bad about Bari Weiss anymore because she's such an amazing person and a wonderful mom.

Calling her a joke is an insult to comedy.

Say whatever you want on your own comment but this won't do you any good at all. Bari Weiss may not be an wonderful
person as a executive at Paramount but this is her biggest
break from the start and she's going to do the best that she can to provide some of the best in entertainment for everyone.

Sorry Mark but Bari is just Faye Dunaway in Network. She'll burn out in a year. She can't handle what's next as she's an indie person in a corporate world.
No one cares if she's a good mom or whatever. Stay at home with your kids and leave the rest of the world alone.

Cbs doesnt know what there doing

Progressives aren't interested in what “everyone” wants, they're authoritarians only interested in what they want for everyone else.

Dylan Efron is getting candid about how brother Zac Efron felt about his viral reaction to his high “Dancing With the Stars” score. 

“I actually did speak to Zac about this, because I was just saying it as I thought it was funny,” Dylan said during a Tuesday appearance on the “Smith Sisters Live” podcast.

He added, “But then Zac was like, ‘Oh no.' He's like, ‘They're misinterpreting it.'”

Dylan, 33, went on to say that the “High School Musical” star, 38 — who attended the November semi-finals in support of Dylan — confessed Zac felt his brother nailed the performance.

“I can't remember what he was saying, but I think he said that he thought it was a really good dance,” Dylan divulged, adding that Zac wondered, “Is that the highest score they would give?”

The “Iron Claw” star was caught on camera turning to his mom after Dylan and pro dance partner Daniella Karagach scored 27 points out of a possible 30 for a tango set to the 1983 hit “I Would Die 4 U” by Prince.

Zac then apparently asked her a question, which users on social media speculated as being, “Are those good scores?”

The “Traitors” alum posited that Zac suggested the scores “should have been higher or something like that.”

“But that Zac was, yeah, I don't know. It was funny regardless. But Zac got defensive,” Dylan said. He's like, ‘No, they misinterpreted what I meant.'”

The former Disney star finally made his long-awaited appearance on the show to support his little brother on the Nov. 18 episode of the show. 

Zac held their little sister Olivia, 5, on his lap, and smiled ear-to-ear while taking in the competition. 

Prior to that, fans flooded social media to pressure Zac into attending the show with comedic uploads. 

When asked by Extra in October about his brother's conspicuous absence, the TV star defended him.

“Hey, he's doing his thing,” he told the outlet, adding that Zac has been “supporting [him] every day.”

Ultimately, Zac and Karagach made it to the finals, facing off against Jordan Chiles, Alix Earle, Robert Irwin and Elaine Hendrix.

Irwin and pro partner Witney Carson walked away with the mirrorball on Nov. 25.

There is no love lost between Pamela Anderson and Liam Neeson following their whirlwind romance.

In fact, they last saw each other in August when he surprised her by coming to see her star in the revival of Tennessee Williams' play “Camino Real” at the Williamstown Theatre Festival.

“He is such a supporter of this new trajectory in my career and kindly tells me he is very proud of me,” Anderson, 58, gushed to People on Tuesday. “I'm sure we will always be in each other's lives.”

Anderson and Neeson's undeniable chemistry first made headlines while they were promoting their summer movie, “The Naked Gun.”

“If you must know, Liam and I were romantically involved for a short while but only after we finished filming,” the actress admitted to People, revealing that she spent an “intimate week” with him at his home in upstate New York.

However, she claimed she had her “own room” and that assistants and family members were in and out of the residence while she was there.

The “Baywatch” star said she spent her days happily “tend[ing] to a rosebush overgrown with mint,” which “he appreciated.”

Still, sparks between them flew, as the actor, 73, introduced her as the “future Mrs. Neeson” when they went to dinner one evening.

Following their “romantic lost week,” Anderson and Neeson “went [their] separate ways to work on other films” and reconnected to promote “The Naked Gun.”

They leaned into the public's interest in their connection by cuddling, holding hands and even sharing a cheeky kiss during interviews and red carpet outings.

“A lot went into creating the intimacy and the groundedness of that character,” Anderson told People of her character in the movie, adding that she “tried to keep it real.”

She admitted she and the “Taken” star — who previously proclaimed he was “madly in love” with her — “had a lot of fun” on the set and that she looked forward to going to work every day.

Describing the film as “very romantic and fun,” Anderson — who previously referred to Neeson as the “perfect gentleman” — argued that “you can't help but get caught up in the love story.”

She also shut down speculation that their flirtatious press tour was a “publicity stunt,” insisting that their feelings were “real.”

No “Bad Blood” here!

Travis Kelce and his brother, Jason, revealed where Taylor Swift stands on their Spotify Wrapped.

On Wednesday's episode of “New Heights,” Jason revealed his most-listened-to album on Spotify is a doo-wop record, as he sings the songs to his seven-month-old daughter, Finnley.

Jason continued that “outside of doo-wop,” his second album is “The Life of a Showgirl.”

“That was No. 1 for me,” Travis replied of his fiancée's latest album.

Jason then quipped, “I can't sing Tay songs. ‘Dad, you're really off pitch here!'”

The Kansas City Chiefs star advised his brother to “just sing along” to the “catchy” tunes. 

Swift first announced her new album during her debut appearance on “New Heights” in August.

Also on Wednesday's podcast, Travis opened up about the Chiefs' devastating 23-20 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers on Dec. 7.

“It's been a tough f–king go around for the past two days,” the tight end began, “You put in all this f–king work in hopes it pays off and right now it's just, for whatever f–king reason man, it's little things, discipline…

“I feel like I always had the answers … and this year, I just can't find them.”

The loss lessened the team's chances of making the playoffs after a disappointing season. 

The “Opalite” songstress cheered on her fiancé from a suite alongside celebrity pals Selena Gomez and Lena Dunham Sunday. 

Leonardo DiCaprio, who appeared on “New Heights” in September, was also seen enjoying the game from the A-list suite.

Kyle Cooke is denying his wife Amanda Batula's claim that he slept at a fan's apartment and “came home at like, 6:30 in the morning.” 

“There's no excuse for staying out as late as I did, but I want to be clear that I did not sleep at a fan's apartment,” Cooke, 43, told People in a statement on Tuesday.

“I was at an event that Amanda chose not to attend, which moved to a bar and then to an after-party.”

“I don't use anything to keep myself wired, so I think I ended up falling asleep on a couch, and suddenly it was almost 6 a.m.,” he added.

 “Do I regret the situation? Absolutely. But that's the truth and full extent of what happened,” he added. 

A rep for Cooke did not immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment. 

Cooke and Batula's marital problems took center stage in Bravo's “Summer House” Season 10 trailer, which was released on Monday. 

After Batula, 34, told her co-stars Lindsay Hubbard and Ciara Miller the story of her husband's night out, Miller responded, “That's f—king insane.”

In another scene, the couple's marriage struggles seemed to get worse as they revealed their differing opinions about Cooke's career as a traveling DJ.

“I wanted him to stop going out and partying, and he found a career where he goes out late and parties,” Batula said in the teaser. 

Later, Cooke could be seen venting to his co-star Carl Radke.

“I played the biggest gig of my life, and Amanda couldn't care less,” he said. “I don't know what matters to her anymore.”

As Page Six previously reported in November, a source exclusively informed us that the Bravolebs could soon be heading for divorce. 

The insider revealed that the pair were living separately while they work through the “challenging time” in their relationship.

However, the source insisted they “are not on a break” and “are both committed to working on their relationship.”

Jubilant Sykes was found stabbed to death in his Santa Monica, Calif., home on Monday — and his son has been arrested as the main suspect. The Grammy nominee was 71.

According to a press release, Santa Monica Police Department (SMPD) officers responded to a 911 call from a person who reported “an assault in progress.”

Once authorities arrived, they were directed inside the home, where they located Sykes, who was suffering from “critical injuries consistent with a stabbing.”

“Santa Monica Fire Department personnel responded and pronounced the individual deceased at the scene,” the press release read.

SMPD said the opera singer's 31-year-old son, Micah Sykes, was “found inside the residence and taken into custody without incident.” 

The police said they “secured the scene, and subsequently obtained a search warrant” and recovered the weapon at the home.

“The circumstances surrounding the incident remain under investigation,” per the press release.

Micah has been booked for homicide and the case will be presented to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office for filing consideration.

Micah reportedly had mental health issues over the years.

Per Rolling Stone, a “Southern Californian woman” filed a restraining order against Micah in 2017. 

The petition read, “Micah shows signs of mental instability. His behavior is unpredictable. Micah poses a real threat… and he has been violent with his own family members.”

Micah was also placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold after an attempted break-in, according to the restraining order petition obtained by Rolling Stone.

Jubilant often shared sweet messages about his three sons on social media. 

In 2020, the musician posted a throwback image of himself with his boys and them as adult men as he spoke about the racial profiling they endured.

“Seeing these photos of my sons as young boys and young adult men, moves me now to tears,”Jubilant captioned the post. “Knowing how blessed we've been to still be here and to experience a LOVE that transcends all. 

“Yet who would ever think that all of these young men as well as myself would at some point in our adult lives experience being hand cuffed, put in a police car, stripped search from the waist down in front of your peers and taken to a downtown precinct,” he added. 

“All at different times in our lives. What we had in common – we were black men innocent of any crime. It happened to my father, it happened to me and it's happened to my sons.”

Much like the characters on the series Pushing Daisies, creator Bryan Fuller has trouble letting go of the dead. In fact, he continues to hope that the long-defunct series will be revived for a third season. Pushing Daisies, which initially aired during the second Bush and first Obama administrations, starred Lee Pace as Ned, a pie-maker with the ability to resurrect the dead with the touch of his finger. Like pretty much everything Fuller creates, be it Hannibal, American Gods, or Dead Like Me, Pushing Daisies has developed a strong cult following over the years, and speaking directly to them through a medium (in this case, ComicBook.com), Fuller says he “absolutely” wants to do another season. He just needs to find someone to pay for it. “We have a season three pitch, and the entire cast wants to come back, and we're hoping we get to return to them,” Fuller said. “We just have to find somebody who wants to make it.”

Pushing Daisies starred Pace as Ned, the head baker and proprietor of the Pie Hole. He also has the power to kill any living thing he touches and resurrect any dead thing he touches (with some caveats). Can Lee Pace resurrect a TV show with the power of his touch? If so, why hasn't he done it for Halt And Catch Fire?

Despite Disney's lack of forward movement, The Hunt For Ben Solo continues. In October, Adam Driver inspired low-boil fan enthusiasm after revealing that he and director Steven Soderbergh were developing a sequel for Driver's Star Wars character before Disney force-choked it. We were shocked that Driver wanted to continue making Star Wars films at all, but perhaps not as surprised as Driver's on-screen foil, Daisy Ridley. Though the once-and-future Rey Skywalker had heard “rumblings” and knew a “piece” of the Ben Solo saga, she didn't expect the typically tight-lipped Driver to be the one to tell the press about it. “When the story came out, no, I was like, ‘Oh, my God!' and it was [Driver] that said it, right?” Ridley tells IGN. “It was funny because, like, ‘Oh, wow, Adam is saying it,' and that's the big surprise of the year.”

Driver's revelation caused a bit of a stir online and outside Disney's offices, which Ridley appreciated. “The way the internet seems to have rallied to try and get it to happen,” she continues. “It's fantastic for us all. It's good for us to all be united about something in a really positive way. Obviously, everyone knows he was a very popular character, but it was also lovely to think, ‘Wow, people really, really care and want this.' I like when people join forces—excuse the pun—from all around the world, all different sorts of people.”

But with all the talk of Ben Solo, whatever came of that Rey movie? Since announcing Ridley's solo film in 2023, Disney announced a new trilogy of Star Wars films, fast-tracked a movie from Shawn Levy, and prepared the world for a years-late Mandalorian movie. Nevertheless, she maintains Rey will be “worth the wait.”

“I think over the years, I've learned how the reality of getting any film made is so massive,” she says. “The hurdles are vast. But with this particularly, I know that incredible voices and creatives are part of it, and I know the wait will be worth it.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","It didn't take long for Spotify to supplant King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard with AI clones","https://www.avclub.com/spotify-king-gizzard-lizard-wizard-ai-clones","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 01:21:00 GMT","

Mere months after Australian psych-rockers King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard exited Spotify at full volume, the band's fans who still linger on the platform claim the streamer is now serving up AI-generated clones of their King. Per Futurism, Redditor Dipper_Pines claims that Spotify recommended them the cleverly named knockoff “King Lizard Wizard” on their Release Radar playlist. As if anyone needed a clearer distillation of how little artists matter to that platform, the five-song EP by King Lizard Wizard features the same song titles as actual King Gizzard songs, including “Rattlesnake,” which has swindled more than 32,000 plays from the King Gizzard's loyal subjects. With its low-effort AI album cover, some tracks even list band leader Stu Mackenzie as “composer” and “lyricist.” Spotify didn't respond to Futurism‘s request for comment, but the “King Lizard” account “disappeared” after its story ran.

Sadly, it's not just a Spotify problem. King Lizard Wizard's music is also available on YouTube, which apparently has the same moderation standards as the Big Green. The King Lizard Wizard songs on YouTube also credit Mackenzie with the lyrics and composition.

King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard left Spotify in July over Spotify CEO Daniel Ek's investments in “AI military drone technology.” One of Ek's investment funds, Prima Materia, raised $600 million in funding for AI drone developer Helsing, of which Ek is also the chairman. Other artists, including Deerhoof and Xiu Xiu, also pulled their music, making similar accusations of war-profiteering against the company that's supposed to give people cheap music. “Although the financial practices of all streaming services are acutely anti-musician, the actions of Spotify to use the profits they made from essentially stealing music in order to murder people to make even more money is almost beyond comprehension,” Xiu Xiu wrote in a statement. But never mind that, what's Daniel Ek's listening age?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Cult Of Criterion: Pee-wee's Big Adventure","https://www.avclub.com/cult-of-criterion-pee-wees-big-adventure","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

In Cult Of Criterion, The A.V. Club highlights a new release from The Criterion Collection each month, examining the films entering an increasingly accessible film canon.

Capturing what it means to be a child doesn't just mean blaring a zippy soundtrack over some fast-paced antics. Being a kid isn't just about goofy energy, or naivety, or wonder. Petulance and rage simmer under the silliness, the emotional consequences to a self-involved young person's friction with the established ways of the world. Every wide-eyed moment of discovery is matched by a narrow-eyed moment of disdain. It's this balance of whimsy and snot, of gleeful mania and furious hysteria, of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, that makes Pee-wee Herman such a perfect grown child—and makes Pee-wee's Big Adventure such a perfect idea for the kind of journey he might dream up.

By the time Paul Reubens gave 26-year-old filmmaker Tim Burton his big break with Pee-wee's Big Adventure, his character Pee-wee Herman had already become a comedy fixture through Reubens' stage show, HBO special, and talk-show drop-ins. He was on The Dating Game three times! But it took Burton's Disney-trained, Disney-rejected sensibility to fully bring Pee-wee's world to life—and to encourage the edgy streak that pushed Big Adventure away from Reubens' planned remake of Pollyanna. After working on The Fox And The Hound and The Black Cauldron, Burton had made a few of his own live-action shorts, pouring his fully formed, Hot Topic-defining aesthetic into a Disney Channel version of Hansel And Gretel and the project that got him fired from Disney: Frankenweenie.

The latter is what caught Reubens' eye, despite the former's Witch living in what looks like an evil version of Pee-wee's Playhouse. But all of Burton's early projects proved that their sensibilities were aligned—they wanted to play in the gray area between kid and adult, between safety and danger, between camp and sincerity, between cutting-edge hip and retro uncool. 

Both artists were obsessed with translating their experience of the past—of the wacky shows and old movies they grew up watching on TV—into a punk-inflected mid-'80s milieu. If Reubens and Burton fell asleep while Howdy Doody and a Universal Monster movie played on adjacent television sets, their shared fever dream would look a lot like Pee-wee's Big Adventure. It's a journey through the collective unconscious of a generation of grown American children, just immature enough to connect with an audience of actual kids.

As Jesse Thorn points out in his Criterion booklet essay, this partially takes the form of Pee-wee's hyperreal road-trip iconography. Pee-wee, on his quest for his stolen Schwinn, zips through a country remembered from a backseat window: Truckers, diners, bikers, roadside dinosaurs and clown statues, rail-riders, drive-in theaters, and tons of cowboys, naturally, right outside the Alamo. These are the larger-than-life images zipping past you when you traverse our highway circulatory system; stuffed into a movie, and it feels like a mind-numbing slog across the country to see a kid's grandparents has been juiced with imagination (Also, uh, Santa was there! And Godzilla!) when retold on the playground.

And Pee-wee is just the kid to tell it. In his form-fitting Glen Plaid suit and shiny Alfalfa haircut, he looks like an especially bullied kid was on his way to picture day when he got Big-ified. He's a kid's idea of an adult (they wear suits, right?) sneering through life, laughing at his own jokes, fighting off the advances of the girl who's got a crush on him, and taking on bullies. He's also a Looney Tune. For every improbable success Pee-wee pulls off with his Bugs-like cross-dressing and costume-swapping, there's a Daffy-like plummet to earth—a moment of rage, failure, slapstick, hubris blowing up in his face. It's Bugs who wins over the biker gang with what's effectively a drag performance of “Tequila,” and it's Daffy who immediately crashes a motorcycle afterward.

It's all part of the silly-scary balance that Burton would make his kid-enticing hallmark. Creating a world not just navigated by a grown kid, but one that had a kid's burgeoning understanding of safety and danger, Burton infused Pee-wee's Big Adventure with fantastical threats. It's not the escaped convicts you need to worry about, or the grumpy bikers, or the furious bulls, or even the jealous boyfriends. The terror had to also be, in its way, a punchline. From Hansel And Gretel and his short Vincent, Burton brought in stop-motion animators Rick Heinrichs and the Chiodo Brothers in order to create these playful scares. Together, they made Large Marge, whose scene is all but a movie reaching out and goosing you.

This is the thoroughly childish spirit permeating Pee-wee's Big Adventure: The volatile, puckish, myopic-yet-charming energy of a kid recounting their day spent playing pretend. And it's the complexity within this tone, the sourness that comes out when Pee-wee blows up at those he's gathered to search for his bike, that situates its fantasy in reality. There's no false schmaltz or saccharine cutesiness, none of the cloying child-courting fluff that softens so much disposable children's media. The stray sass, the random venom, the whiplash between innocence and indignation—these are what makes Pee-wee's Big Adventure an enduring encapsulation of childhood.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Robert Pattinson and Zendaya awkwardly plan a wedding in first The Drama teaser","https://www.avclub.com/the-drama-teaser-robert-pattinson-zendaya","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 15:29:17 GMT","

Robert Pattinson and Zendaya are planning a wedding, and it doesn't seem to be the most natural fit. That's about the extent of the information we get from the first teaser for The Drama, the new film from director Kirstoffer Borgli. But based on the director's previous work (Dream Scenario, Sick Of Myself) it's safe to assume that this surface tension will soon give way to something darker and much more surreal. 

In the clip, the two actors sit for what appears to be an engagement photo shoot. It seems like they hardly know each other—despite a very funny Zoe Winters insisting otherwise while trying to get them to pose—and uncomfortable around each other. The few glimpses of their eventual wedding seems to be disastrous, with Zendaya's character taking swigs of liquor straight from the bottle and Pattinson's leaving the event with a bloodied face. 



It seems that that the two had a much different relationship behind the scenes, with at least one good story so far emerging from the set. “We had a scene together that was driving me crazy. I was desperately looking for its meaning, writing pages and pages of textual analysis,” Pattinson said earlier this year (via The Independent). “I ended up calling Zendaya the night before shooting the scene. I shared my doubts with her, I spoke for two hours, and after a while, very calmly, she made me understand that the line just said what it meant to say, that there was no hidden meaning. And there I was going crazy for three days.” 

The Drama opens in theaters on April 3.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","What Matt Lauer Is Doing Now & TV Comeback Rumors","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/matt-lauer-doing-now-tv-comeback/","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 06:56:53 GMT","

For more than two decades, Matt Lauer was a constant figure on television. Whether it was anchoring NBC's “Today” or hosting the network's Olympic Games coverage, Layer was perhaps one of the most recognizable figures in households across the country.

That all came to an end in 2017, with Lauer leaving his role at NBC when his contract was terminated. But what has the news anchor been up to since then? Sources close to him have provided some details about Lauer's recent life.

According to People, a source close to Lauer has given some insight into his current state of affairs. The source confirmed that the former news anchor is “doing well in his private life” and “wants to get back into the media arena in some capacity, if not TV.” 

The source continued by saying,  “He has talked to some people about it.”

Providing more updates about what Lauer has been up to and what he is currently doing, the insider revealed that he has mostly been living in and around the Hamptons in New York. However, he does visit his native New Zealand frequently as well.

People also reported the source as saying that Lauer is happy with his life, although he remains “angry” with “the way he was treated by the industry” and “people he thought were his friends.”

Lauer is also seemingly still in a relationship with publicist Shamin Abas and is spending a lot of his time with his family. He shares three children with his former wife Annette Roque. The source indicates that much of his focus is on being “good father” to his kids and “spending time with them.”

Since his firing in 2017, Lauer has largely stayed out of public life, choosing instead to keep out the spotlight and love privately with his family. Yet, he has been spotted at some public events, including the wedding of Don Lemon back in 2024.

Another source with apparent inside information about Lauer's life also recently spoke to Page Six about a possible return to television.

There have been rumors for several years that Lauer is seeking an opportunity to revive his career and once again take up hosting duties. 

The source revealed that his “savvy publicist girlfriend,” Shamin Abas, has been working hard to keep Lauer's name out there and push him forward to attempt a comeback.

“She is encouraging him to keep trying and she is definitely persistent. There have been instances of second and third acts with other stars, so they think people will give him a chance,” the source said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Anderson Cooper's Next Career Move Has Been Revealed","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/anderson-cooper-signs-new-contract-cnn/","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 06:57:00 GMT","

Despite speculation that the news anchor and journalist would be leaving CNN for pastures new, it has emerged that Anderson Cooper has signed a new contract that will keep him at the network for the foreseeable future. This ends rumors of him joining CBS or other rival networks after his current contract came to an end.

Rumors first began swirling that Cooper could leave CNN after he switched talent agencies from United Talent Agency to Creative Artists Agency. This was seen as a possible precursor of a switch to a different network, with Cooper utilizing the new agency to gain a better deal.

However, Variety is reporting that Cooper has put pen to paper on a new contract that will keep him anchoring on CNN, a network he first joined back in 2001. The outlet cites three sources with knowledge of the matter, claiming that Cooper signed a new contract. 

CNN has yet to provide an official announcement about the deal and there's no solid details about how long the network has tied Cooper down and whether it will see him work on new projects.

Cooper's contract renewal flies in the face of recent trends, where networks have allowed veteran broadcasters to leave as ratings go down. The fact that the journalist contributes more than just his nightly news show is likely a key factor in him being retained. After all, Cooper also works on “The Whole Story” and the “All There Is” podcast in addition to other coverage.

CBS was seen as the likely destination for Cooper if he departed CNN. The news anchor already has a relationship as he works as a correspondent for CBS News' “60 Minutes.”

Earlier this year, Cooper opened up about how he coped with the loss of his father as a child. While appearing on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” Cooper discussed the impact of losing his father at a young age. 

“I shut down,” he told Colbert. “I went for 40 years without allowing myself to feel the pain of the grief. But the irony is, by not allowing myself to feel the pain of it, I also didn't allow myself to ever feel joy. True joy. Because you can't have one without the other.”

He added, “It's only in the last two years, by feeling this grief and this sadness, that I've been able to feel joy. And I have a lot to feel joy about because I've got these two little boys who are just incredible.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Michael Bublé & Carson Daly Stunned They Just Met the Pope -- Twice: 'Nothing Prepares You For This'","https://entertainmentnow.com/the-voice/pope-leo-michael-buble-carson-daly/","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 14:25:21 GMT","

Michael Bublé and Carson Daly, co-stars on NBC's “The Voice,” are still trying to process the past weekend, after meeting Pope Leo XIV twice at the Vatican on December 5 and 6, 2025. Both raised Catholic, Bublé invited Daly to attend his performance at the Concert With the Poor, but neither realized just how deeply the trip — and meeting the Pope in particular — would impact them. 

“Nothing prepares you for this,” Bublé wrote on December 10 over a social media video of him as a child on the day of his First Communion, and then at the Vatican decades later, speaking to Pope Leo. 

“Standing in the Vatican with my family, meeting the Pope, and performing for such beautiful souls is something I will carry with me forever,” the crooner wrote in his caption, while Daly also reflected on the impact of the trip in an essay for NBC, in which he wrote that he and Bublé “both kept asking each other: How in the world did this just happen?” 

In the caption of his December 10 post, Bublé wrote, “Trying to put this past weekend into words feels almost impossible. Faith has always been woven into my life, little me in that white First Communion outfit is proof of that. God has quietly remained at the center of everything I do and when I look back on my life and career, I can see his hand in all of it: in my family, my friends, everyone I've worked with, and in all of you.” 

On December 8, Bublé shared a carousel of photos from the special day, beginning with one of himself with his wife, Luisana Lopilato, and his parents at the Vatican, writing, “Standing before His Holiness, Pope Leo XIV, alongside my wife Lu, my parents and my friends was an experience beyond anything we could have dreamed of. To share a few moments with someone whose kindness, humility, and compassion have touched so many was truly unforgettable. This day has filled us with peace, hope and a renewed sense of faith and we are deeply grateful.”

Lopilato also posted about the experience on December 8, writing that “it was a moment full of emotion… but also full of pride. Because I can't even put into words how proud I am of Mike. Just like I told him in private: ‘I won't be able to hold it together, I'm going to cry the whole time.' And yes… that's exactly what happened.” 

After returning to the U.S., Daly shared that Bublé invited him and his wife Siri to accompany his family to the Vatican, writing in an essay for NBC that he and Bublé “share not only the love of music, but also a deep Catholic faith.”

Daly continued, “Both altar boys growing up, he was the first person I exchanged texts with when the white smoke appeared over the Vatican on May 8, 2025, and a new pope was revealed. The first American pope: Pope Leo XIV.” 

On December 6, one day after meeting the Pope for the first time, Daly wrote that at the concert that Bublé headlined for “3,000 beautiful, disadvantaged people from all over the world,” the Pope “sat 10 feet away from us.”

Daly shared, “We witnessed him singing along to Bublé, the Choir of the Diocese of Rome and the incredible Nova Opera Orchestra. It was without a doubt one of the best and most inspiring music events I've ever witnessed.”

Daly and Bublé will be back in Los Angeles together on December 15 and 16 for the season 28 finale of “The Voice.”

From “Father of the Bride” to “My Best Friend's Wedding” and more bro-ish fare like “The Hangover,” plenty of movies have captured how things always seem to go sideways in the run-up to nuptials and can still have a happy ending. But even with little to go on, we can assume that “The Drama,” from “Dream Scenario” filmmaker Kristoffer Borgli, will not be one of those films.

The upcoming A24 feature stars Zendaya and Robert Pattinson as “a happily engaged couple” who is “put to the test when an unexpected turn sends their wedding week off the rails,” according to the logline. While that premise seems harmless enough, Borgli is not in the habit of making innocuous films; instead, his previous features, including “Sick of Myself,” revel in the repulsive aspects of people and contemporary, image-obsessed society. Add to that the fact that “Beau Is Afraid” filmmaker Ari Aster is the one producing “The Drama,” and that both of its stars enjoy taking on twisted romantic roles when they have a chance, and it seems audiences are in for a bit more than a wedding-themed comedy of errors. 

 








Related Stories Sundance Programmers Break Down a 2026 Lineup Filled with Comedies and Lots of Charli XCX ‘Ella McCay' Review: James L. Brooks Returns with an Old-Fashioned Dramedy Inspired by Screwball Films of Yore 

Exactly what kind of horrors await are very much unclear, given that the newly-released teaser trailer mostly focuses on a scene where Zendaya and Pattinson's characters look uncomfortable while practicing for wedding shots. There are only the vaguest hints about what's to come in flashbacks to happy moments from the couple's life together, which give way to frenzied scenes from the wedding day, including the husband-to-be with a bloody nose. But Donna Lewis' “I Love You Always Forever” bopping along cheerily in the background can't be a good sign.

Because the fates love a dramatic entrance, the now-dueling bids for WBD landed just days before Sundance unveils its 2026 lineup and its last festival in Park City. WBD doesn't move the needle at festivals anymore, but the sheer scale and chaos of this merger warps everything around it. It introduces months of instability into a business that's already lost its leeway for turbulence. 

That will shape the mood and the market long before anyone steps onto Main Street, but some of the most important debuts may not be films at all. Look for the models, companies, and creative playbooks built precisely because the old rules finally broke.

Here's my take on what we might expect at Sundance and other festivals this year, and how that might impact filmmakers. While WBD's buyer is subject to change, the upheaval is guaranteed. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Indie filmmakers have a long history of pushing forward, business climates be damned. Mergers, YouTube, vertical video, AI — none of it has ever slowed the drive to make movies. 

But two things can be true at once: The WBD merger saga does, in fact, change everything. It's the clearest signal yet that the era of the traditional studio system (which is also the ecosystem that shaped Sundance) is ending. 

 










Whenever studios retreat, new players emerge to fill the vacuum. We're already seeing it with rising buyers like Sumerian Pictures, Row K, 1-2 Special, Black Bear, and Willa. Historically, periods of industry contraction tend to spark periods of indie-market invention. 

Some of the new distributors like Willa, Watermelon, and Cartuna x Dweck are building models centered on grassroots marketing, creator-driven distribution, and sustained audience development. That changes the kinds of films that get traction and the kinds of filmmakers who thrive. 

It's also why I don't expect 2026 to be just another “wait and see” year. I think Sundance 2026 will be remembered as the moment when these emerging models stopped feeling experimental and started feeling inevitable. (I plan to spend the festival finding as many of them as I can — and if you're building one, come find me.) 

Pending mergers usually turn its players into hardcore conservatives (no pun intended), but Paramount and Warners abandoned their specialty labels long ago and it's been years since either behaved like real festival buyers. (Paramount picked up “Like Crazy” in 2011; Warners bought “Superman: Super/Man”in 2024, because how could it not.) Netflix looms large but in practice it bought two titles last year.Park City is also renowned for creating a Planet Sundance effect that shrinks the world's concerns to what played well at the Eccles; this year will be especially potent as the last festival before it relocates to Boulder. 

So, no great loss? 

 










Nope. The biggest stressor is the merger, which is its own force of nature, and the gravitational pull it creates for the entire industry. 

Blame human nature: While it's illegal for Netflix or Paramount to influence WBD operations before the deal closes, everyone at Warners will be keenly aware that their actions could cost them their jobs.

With their decisions judged by whoever ends up in charge, it creates an unofficial operating principle: What Would Netflix or Paramount Do? The result is predictable: “No” carries much less risk than “Yes.” The goal is to avoid deals that might irritate a future owner, spark second-guessing, or require long-term bets. (Looking at you, HBO.)

As other studios watch a multi-billion-dollar disruption unfold, expect them to instinctively tap the brakes while they figure out what the new hierarchy means for them. 

This is how slowdowns spread: One merger becomes everyone's “are you sure?” filter. This points to:    

• Fewer active buyers • Longer sales cycles • Extra anxiety around risk and originality • And, that old favorite: “We love it, but we need to wait.” 

Don't freak out over the silences and limbo; expect it. Plan for more diligence, more follow-up. Build sales strategies around delayed decisions and conservative spending. 

Sundance always has been a great barometer to track Hollywood's center of gravity. Studios merge, collapse, rebrand, or quietly retreat. What endures are the filmmakers who adapt faster than the systems built to support them. 

 










Besides David Zaslav, I don't believe this merger is good for anyone; that may include the winning studio. Long term, it probably won't be good for Hollywood at all. 

But if there is an upside, it belongs to the people working outside the legacy structures. The merger sends up a flare announcing that the future isn't coming; it's already here. Even century-old Time Magazine knows it, naming YouTube's Neal Mohan CEO of the year. 

For filmmakers willing to release outdated expectations and outright myths, there is real opportunity. Chaos creates energy, vacuums invite innovation, and capitalism will scale whatever works.

The first nine films will be arranged into two “shelves”: Unreleased Gems, consisting of recent festival favorites that previously did not have distribution; and Lost & Found, which is comprised of previously lost or newly restored classics.

Notable titles include Todd Haynes' 1991 debut feature “Poison,” Kiyoshi Kurosawa's “Before We Vanish,” and 2025 SXSW premiere “It Ends.” 
 










“Weʼre incredibly proud of what we and our community have built,ˮ Letterboxd CEO and co-founder Matthew Buchanan said in a statement. “We take their lead, and believe that has been integral to Letterboxdʼs success. They tell us what's really happening — a 1980s action film suddenly trending, a festival title from two years ago still being added to watchlists.”

He continued, “Video Store lets us act on that real demand, whether itʼs helping a distributor unlock value from a forgotten gem in its vault or giving a filmmaker direct access to the audience theyʼve been building on our platform. Itʼs our way of saying to the industry: letʼs harness this interest to get films to the people who want them most.ˮ

With a name like Binary Algorithms, you might expect the Colombian artist to make pitch-black techno that sounds like sheet metal wobbling in a freeway underpass. But Andrés Ávila's approach to dance music is bold and saturated, with drums and synths blown up into big, skeuomorphic shapes. Ávila's records have an ambitious conceptual bent to match their sounds. Previous EPs have been themed around René Descartes' thought applied to a “cyber-network environment,” or a Drexciya-referencing underwater civilization called Tunja from the year 2499, accompanied by political screeds about the whitewashing of electronic music or the moral quandaries of AI. On Reminiscencias, his debut album, Ávila looks away from sci-fi and toward his own life and upbringing in Colombia, writing techno tracks so big (and big-hearted) that it feels like you could reach out and touch them.

Reminiscencias has an epic sweep, layering heart-tugging melodies with the rumbling sounds of traffic and urban life. Ávila is something of a sound design prodigy. In his hands, synths can sound like Hollywood strings (“Cenizas”), and arp notes wobble and glow like lightbulb filaments (“Something to Fight For”). Polished drums tap out funky, broken patterns with just the right amount of force, enough to rattle windows without the bass blotting everything else out. There's an inviting quality to this production style, where everything feels like it exists in a discrete, three-dimensional space.

These tendencies lend Reminiscencias a larger-than-life quality that channels '00s thriller scores crossed with early-'10s techno, recalling a time when Berghain still drove (or at least lorded over) underground nightlife culture. It's easy to imagine “To Resist and Break,” with its foreboding bassline and whip-crack drums, soundtracking a tense pursuit from The Bourne Identity, but there's also a stirring emotional undercurrent in the vein of E.R.P. or the Exaltics—artists who sneak stately melodies into tracks that are precision engineered for the club. Throughout the LP, dance tracks are broken up by sketches that are a notch above the usual techno album interludes, like “Clamor de Dolor,” which makes me think of a church organist trying to play a Burial tune.

There are a few straight-up techno barnstormers here, like acid-flecked fever dream “Frágiles,” but Reminiscencias is at its best when the rhythms are more syncopated and unexpected sounds unexpectedly fit together like jigsaw puzzle pieces. Detroit electro goes with flamboyant hand drumming on “Sub-Periphery,” dub-techno chords bubble up on “To Resist and Break,” and “Future[Delusion]” splits the difference between peak-period Shed and Involver-era Sasha. At some point the techno label feels inadequate: Ávila makes familiar but just-novel-enough dance music out of the remnants of electro, prog house, drum'n'bass, breaks, and dub. It's like throwing logs into a woodchipper and making new, weirder trees out of the chips.

For all its resistance-themed song titles, chord progressions that sound like vague calls to action, and talk about Latin American identity, Reminiscencias keeps its cards close to its chest. A text accompanying the album notes that while Latin dance music is often reduced to “tropical” sounds, this record is meant to feel more urban—but that's the closest thing to a story or guiding theme here. In an era obsessed with identity and subtext (or sometimes just plain-old text) Reminiscencias lets dance music live on its own terms, as much for the dancefloor or the living room as you want it to be. There's not a single word, or snippet of human voice, anywhere on the LP. Instead, there are only broad strokes of fear, hope, triumph, and resignation. It's an old-school approach to techno focused on the inhuman sound of machines, infused with a spirit so expansive that the meaning is universal anyway.

Listening to wet glass feels like riding shotgun on a long, winding drive down a rain-slick highway before dawn. But wherever Verity Den are headed on their second album, their narrators usually have their heads somewhere else. “Last night they were singing about West Virginia in Boston,” co-lead vocalist Mike Wallace shouts into the anonymous night sky. “Someone's always running on the bridge I'm driving under.” These 10 tracks exist between locations, coming together like fragments of a dream you're trying to pin down while still in sleep's shallow end. But don't mistake Verity Den's liminality for stagnation—their subconscious is anything but inactive, and it stirs with as much lucidity and nerve as any waking mind.

Verity Den's 2024 self-titled debut was mostly built from scrappy, lo-fi demos. The relative clarity of its follow-up lends their homespun sound a new sense of intimacy and unpredictability. The production takes on a wintry vastness, creating greater expanses for the disparate elements of each song to travel. The drum crescendo on “spit red” builds like a reverse-echo, growing closer and more defined; on “vacant lot,” Casey Proctor's pillowy vocals coalesce with reverberating guitar feedback like fog gathering on a windshield. Subaquatic seven-minute centerpiece “push down hard / tess II” sounds like what Proctor describes in its lyrics—“Soul inside the swimming pool/Shining bright just to mess with you”—as her voice and the gentle acoustic strumming provide surface tension.

Wallace's talk-singing is a dissonant complement to Proctor's Hope Sandoval-like melodies. The mix tends to keep their voices at a distance, as though you're meant to hear them from the next room or through a roadside pay phone. “Late party, wish I was home,” Proctor sighs on “sympathizer,” emerging from slumber on gleaming, squeaky guitars. You can feel her exhaustion, but she doesn't sound weighed down by it. “Do. You. Sympathize?” she sings, her delivery unexpectedly emphatic in its monotone and even more alluring when she trails off and lets a wiry guitar tangle fill in the rest for her.

The sparse lyrics throughout wet glass leave room for mutability. It's a record of few words, tumbling through the dreamlike arrangements and reshaped by their melodies. Penultimate track “to trees” sounds raw and improvisational, almost unfinished. It leaves Proctor's voice unadorned with just a meandering acoustic guitar and ambient background hum: “You belong to trees/Deep below two trees.” The single repeated line of “unsolved mystery” is at first unintelligible under a humming drone, fuzzy ticking, and softly rumbling keys until it floats to the surface like a message in a bottle at the track's conclusion: “You've got it now,” Proctor sings, perhaps a reference to one of Verity Den's biggest influences, Yo La Tengo. You can hear the Hoboken band's DNA in the dusky opener “vacant lot,” with its storm of distortion; and in the title track that follows, its thick, flinty guitar riffs feel like a fleece blanket and the hissing and clanging of a radiator on a winter morning. Both comforting and tense, it weaves pop melodies into a loose, spiraling jam that could probably sustain itself for twice the song's runtime given a particularly raucous live rendition.

Compared to the sleepier strains of dream-pop and shoegaze, Verity Den let their lucid dreams run rampant. Their best hooks glint through the fog of sinuous, loud-and-quiet chord progressions, shaking up extended jams even if just for a shining moment. Bright basslines and tinny drums on “spit red” push against Wallace's whisper-shouted wallflower observations about “barn-sour” horses and his ambivalence toward the party he's attending, as he ponders the alienating effects of life on the road. “I hear something breaking off in the distance,” he remarks. “Maybe it's just thunder.” “green drag” is the record's brightest spot, a piece of ride-into-the-sunset jangle-pop. “Nothing but laughter from the stands,” Wallace promises in his victory-speech verses while Proctor's voice flits through hazy, honeyed choruses. wet glass's meandering is what makes its compact moments of certainty so glorious. Even when you don't know where their jamming will lead, it's more than enough to be along for the ride.

There's a right way to love Tems, and it starts with sacrifice. On Love Is a Kingdom, she says “mine” (as in, “You're mine”) a total of 69 times—70 if you count the one-off “you not mine.” Most of these instances—57, to be precise—reside in track “Mine,” but its reiterations reveal the kind of amor Tems inhabits: a union where two souls become one.

Tems' use of repetition has defined her best songs, like “Burning” and all seven tracks on this EP. It never feels lazy or formulaic; her voice carries an authenticity, as if she's reached flow state. Beyond her hooks, Tems' kingdom rises on a foundation of syncopated log drums and 808s, draped in airy harmonies and soft strings. Her falsetto floats above it all, drifting between African, American, and Caribbean soundscapes and accompanied by shekere rattles.

Where her full-length debut, Born in the Wild, detailed the Nigerian artist's genesis with expansive storytelling, Love Is a Kingdom pares everything back. Tems cuts out nearly all external input, laying her feelings bare in a diary of romantic whiplash. Her vision of love reads like scripture: patient, kind, protective, and hopeful, even when it breaks you. The EP is a short 20 minutes, but its emotional arc feels liturgical. Songs move like mood swings in slow motion, dwelling on a fragment of time before shifting. One moment, Tems is dunking on an unambitious, no-good partner; the next, she's surrendered to a sacrificial love, repeating her devotion like a prayer she can't shake. Love makes you do strange things.

The Afropop-y “First” opens like a psalm of self-preservation. “They keep trying to control me,” she sings, “So I have to change the story.” She means it: Tems produced, composed, and wrote the bulk of this project, alongside longtime collaborator GuiltyBeatz. The sound stays close to her prog-R&B and Afrobeats roots, with small diversions: “I'm Not Sure,” produced by Jonah Christian and Rob Bisel, drifts into Spanish-tinged textures; London and AoD switch it up with the churchy warmth of “Lagos Love” and the three-step thrum of “Big Daddy”'s amapiano-Afrotech bounce.

“What You Need” is the EP's turning point. It follows “Mine,” a vow of devotion, and snaps the record into its not-so-happy-ever-after. The breakup feels overheard, like we've accidentally stepped into her confession booth. “I'm not what you need,” Tems repeats, trapped inside the guilt. Her voice cracks, and here it comes: “You not mine.” Closer “Is There a Reason” is a brave interrogation of faith that recalls the spiritual searching of “Me & U.” In it, Tems addresses God, wrestling with the worth of sacrifice and suffering.

This spiritual dimension, once a subtle undercurrent, now frames the entire project, elevating the EP from a love story into a meditation on endurance. But Tems' lyricism can also lean too abstract, masking her emotions in celestial metaphors and mythic language that feel just out of reach. It's poetic, though sometimes I wish she'd descend from the clouds; a few concrete details would make the kingdom that much less ethereally distant. Short but worthy of your attention, Love Is a Kingdom is the work of an artist who wields her voice like a balm as she challenges what it means to love and be loved for eternity.

	Nikki McCann Ramirez



Donald Trump's administration for months now has been launching missile strikes at small boats allegedly connected to drug smuggling operations in the Caribbean. The administration is claiming without much evidence that they are only targeting “narco terrorists,” a flimsy justification for the strikes that many believe are illegal regardless of who was on board the boats.


	The administration has conducted as least 22 strikes since September, and killed at least 87 people. Most of the boats have been targeted in international waters around Venezuela and the Eastern Pacific Ocean, and almost invariably consist of small vessels with up to around a dozen passengers.


	Questions about the already dubiously legal strikes came to a head last week after The Washington Post reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have a verbal order to “kill everybody” on a suspected drug boat off the coast of Venezuela on Sept. 2, prompting a second strike to finish off two survivors clinging to the wreckage.

	











	Hegseth has cited the “fog of war” in defending the second strike, but experts have argued that finishing off the survivors, the video of which the Pentagon has yet to release, was illegal.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“In Iraq and Afghanistan, there were lots of situations that were very fuzzy, very unclear — actual fog of war, hard to make decisions — but this is so straightforward,” Pauline Shanks Kaurin, a former professor of military ethics at the Naval War College, tells Rolling Stone. “This is the textbook example in military training, especially in the Navy. If you've got shipwrecked people, it doesn't matter who they are, you have an obligation [to aid].”

	











	To Shanks Kaurin, the signs of Trump and Hegseth's reckless approach to the laws of war have been visible for almost a decade.


	In 2016, Trump sparred with the press over comments he made endorsing the use of torture against accused terrorists and their families by the military. They “won't refuse,” Trump said of the possibility that members of the armed forces could refuse his orders. “They're not going to refuse me. Believe me.”

	During Hegseth's January confirmation hearings, lawmakers grilled him on a series of past statements indicating his disdain for the laws of war. The man now in charge of the military had once complained that the Geneva Conventions were outdated and overly restrictive documents, referred to Judge Advocate General (JAG) officers (members of the military tasked with ensuring the laws of war are respected) as “jagoffs” who were part of a “war on warriors.” In 2019, Hegseth also lobbied Trump to help secure pardons for two notorious convicted war criminals.


	It shouldn't be too shocking, then, that Trump and Hegseth are now trying to fend off war crime allegations, as lawmakers and the public continue to dig into what led to the second strike on Sept. 2 — as well as the legality of the broader campaign to target boats. Here's everything you need to know about the attacks taking place in the Caribbean.


	The Trump administration claims that those aboard the boats are drug traffickers belonging to the Venezuelan organized crime network Tren de Aragua, which was designated a foreign terrorist organization earlier this year, and that the boats contain fentanyl-laced cocaine in transit to other nations — like nearby Trinidad and Tobago — that would eventually make its way to the United States. (Some experts say that if the boats are carrying drugs (particularly cocaine) from Venezuela, they are likely en route to Europe, and that deadly fentanyl is by and large transported across land routes through the Mexican border.)

	“Please let this serve as notice to anyone even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America,” Trump wrote on Truth Social in September, “BEWARE.”


	Like many legal experts, Brian Finucane, senior U.S. adviser at the International Crisis Group, disputes the administration's attempt to frame the strikes as counterterrorism. While some of those killed may be involved in drug running, or low-skilled criminality, they're likely operating on a profit motive. They are not “using violence against civilians for political or ideological aims — typically what we associate with terrorism,” he says.

	











	The Coast Guard and other law enforcement agencies have a long history of stopping vessels suspected of carrying drugs, seizing the cargo, and arresting the crew. The sharp escalation from stop-and-seizure to fiery death on the high seas is just the latest way the administration is using claims of anti-terrorism to skirt established law.


	“The administration's not just labeling the people on these boats as ‘terrorists.' It's also using the term to apply to Nicolas Maduro, Latin American immigrants, these guys they sent to CECOT in El Salvador — and also to domestic political opponents,” Finucane adds. When the “executive asserts a prerogative, a license to kill, outside of the law because somebody a ‘terrorist,' that sort of prerogative can be deployed elsewhere.”


	On Sept. 2, members of the administration — including Trump and Hegseth — publicly bragged about having sunk a boat carrying 11 individuals in international waters off the coast of Venezuela. The Pentagon released a video of the strike on social media which showed the craft bursting into flames after being hit.


	Trump claimed in a Truth Social post that the passengers of the vessel were “positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists,” who were “operating under the control of [Venezuelan President] Nicholas Maduro.” Trump had repeatedly made this claim, despite American intelligence agencies disputing the assertion that the Maduro regime exerts control over Venezuelan-linked drug operations in the United States.


	The video only showed one strike, but it later became clear the public had not been given the full story. In December, The Washington Post reported that Hegseth had issued an order to “kill everybody” onboard the vessel, as one source with knowledge put it, and that a second strike about half an hour after the first had been fired to finish off two survivors who were clinging to the wreckage of the boat. Hegseth initially claimed he watched the strike “live” before clarifying that he'd only seen the first shot, and left the room before the second.


	The administration has continuously shifted its narrative about the second strike, initially denying the report before confirming a few days later that it did indeed carry out a second strike. Admiral Frank Bradley, who oversaw the strikes, told lawmakers last week that Hegseth never gave a “kill everybody” order, and that he viewed the survivors as legitimate targets.

	











	Democrats who have viewed the video of the second strike don't seem to agree, describing it as one of the most “disturbing” things they've ever seen and suggesting that the men had seemingly surrendered or were attempting to signal for help. Shanks Kaurin, the former military ethics professor, says the act is practically a textbook definition of a war crime, one that SEAL Team Six — which reportedly carried out the two-pronged strike — would be aware of.


	“In a maritime context, once you've blown up their boat, the boat is no longer seaworthy, they have no way to survive,” she explains. “The second thing is whether the people are still a threat. … There's no evidence that these two guys in the water posed any kind of reasonable threat, especially if what [the Americans] were using was drones.”


	“This is something that the lowliest just-got-on-the-ship person would have known — much less admirals and everyone in between on the chain of command,” she adds. “ They failed the intro 101 exam, essentially.”


	Members of the government are asserting that the men in the boats are narcoterrorists affiliated with Latin American drug cartels, and that the drugs they are allegedly transporting are in and of themselves a weapon of war.


	On October 1, one month after the strikes first began, the president sent a notification of “non-international armed conflict” to Congress, essentially claiming that the U.S. is at war with the cartels and designating the alleged drug smugglers as “unlawful combatants.” The administration did not specify which cartes or entities America is at war with, giving itself broad latitude to target essentially anyone they wanted.


	As Finucane puts it, the administration is attempting to apply the public “framing” of the post 9/11 War on Terror to drug trafficking syndicates, but their actual legal rationale is not publicly available.


	“One of the major problems is that we don't actually have the official legal justification that the U.S. government is relying on,” Finucane says. “There's a 40-something page memo from the Department of Justice that remains a secret. They haven't disclosed it.”


	In recent decades, the Pentagon has relied on memos from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel as a form of cover for military operations of dubious legality. It's essentially the government's way of saying “my lawyer told me this was OK, and they're the ones who actually know the law.” The most infamous example of this were the so-called Torture Memos produced in the aftermath of 9/11, which asserted that the use of torture (or as they called it “enhanced interrogation”) was legally permissable. “It seems as though [the DOJ is] playing a similar role here,” Finucane explains, “where instead of producing a torture memo, they produce a murder memo.”

	











	According to a description of the memo obtained by The New York Times, the document claims that “drug cartels are intentionally trying to kill Americans and destabilize the Western Hemisphere. The groups are presented not as unscrupulous businesses trying to profit from drug trafficking, but as terrorists who sell narcotics as a means of financing violence.” It also asserts that Trump has “legitimate authority” to determine if the U.S. engaged in an armed conflict, even without the approval of Congress.


	“We have this rhetoric, these political justifications from the administration, which are inconsistent, not right, or factually challenged,” Finucane adds of the government's defense of the strikes. But the public narrative being put forth by the administration could be “different than the supposed legal rationale” outlined in the DOJ's classified memo, he adds. The government could potentially be misrepresenting or exceeding the bounds of the DOJ's supposed authorization, and the public has no way of knowing.


	Legal experts in international and military law say that's not actually how any of this works.


	“All of the strikes constitute unlawful killing,” Finucane says, explaining that outside of an established war the killing may not necessarily be a war crime, but it's still unlawful. “There is no armed conflict, right? And outside of armed conflict, the term for premeditated killing is murder.”


	There are several potential layers to the illegality.


	“What is significant about the second strike on Sept. 2 is that — based on the facts that have emerged — even if you buy the administration's bogus argument that there is a war, and armed conflict, and that the law of war somehow applies to this operation, based on the facts that we have, the re-attack does appear to be a war crime,” he adds, “even under the administration's own bogus legal construct.”


	A legal analysis by Just Security — a nonpartisan law journal focused on U.S. national security — rejects the administration's claims of legality under the umbrella of a “non-international armed conflict” (a conflict with a non-state entity) because past legal precedent holds that “an armed conflict can exist only between parties that are sufficiently organized to confront each other with military means.”


	“Hostile action using military means has been engaged in only by the United States, not by any cartel or criminal gang against us,” Just Security writes. “The gangs and cartels are involved in criminality when they are trafficking drugs, to be sure, but they are not organized militarily to engage in military operations.”

	











	The review adds that in the case of all the strikes conducted by the government “because there is no armed conflict, international human rights law governs the U.S. operations. The law does not allow for the use of deadly force except in situations where it is employed to safeguard life.”


	Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are not pleased. Despite attempted defenses from MAGA loyalists, the pressure for answers from both Trump and Hegseth is growing in and outside of Capitol Hill.


	According to a draft of an upcoming Pentagon funding bill, lawmakers are planning to withhold money from Hegseth's travel budget until the House and Senate Armed Services Committees receives “unedited” copies of strike footage.


	Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said last week amidst the administration's shifting narrative about the “double tap” strike that Hegseth was either “lying to us … or he's incompetent and didn't know it had happened.”


	Members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees viewed the video in a closed door meeting with Admiral Bradley last week.


	“What I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service,” said Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), referring to the video of the second strike. “You have two individuals and clear distress, without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel, who were killed by the United States.” Himes added that “any American who sees the video that I saw will see the United States military attacking shipwrecked sailors.”


	During a Cabinet meeting on Dec. 2, Hegseth reaffirmed his claim that he had nothing to do with the double tap strike. “I did not personally see survivors,” Hegseth said, “that thing was on fire and it exploded […] you can't see anything. This is called the fog of war.”


	Hegseth has also not paused the attacks on boats in the Caribbean. On Dec. 4, he bragged about ordering another boat be blown up on social media, telling a Turning Point USA employee fantasizing about the murders that their wish was his “command.” He also tweeted out an AI-generated cartoon of the beloved child storybook character Franklin The Turtle shooting a shoulder-fired missile at boats.


	“Tweeting memes in the middle of a potential armed conflict is something no serious military leader would ever even think of doing,” Senate Minority Leader Schumer (D-N.Y.) said. “The only thing this tweet accomplishes is to remind the whole world that Pete Hegseth is not up to the job.”

	











	Hegseth is scheduled to brief lawmakers in a closed door session later this week.


	Trump has repeatedly stated that he supports the strikes and would like to continue seeing supposed drug boats obliterated by the military. On Dec. 2, he indicated he was open to a public release of the video, but claimed to have never said anything of the sort on Monday.


	“I didn't say that, you said that,” he told a reporter in the Oval Office. “This is ABC fake news. Whatever Hegseth decides is ok with me […] Let me just tell you, you are an obnoxious reporter. Actually, a terrible reporter.”

	“Every boat we knock out of the water we save 25,000 lives,” he claimed without evidence.


	According to a Tuesday report from The Wall Street Journal, the reversal may have come after Hegseth personally raised concerns to the president that “tactics and intelligence methods might be compromised if the video is released.”

Billie Eilish teams up with James Cameron to revamp the modern concert film in the first trailer for Hit Me Hard and Soft: The Tour (Live in 3D). In theaters March 20, 2026, the release will capture the biggest tour of the 23-year-old musician's career. The run, which wrapped last month, consisted of 106 shows across four continents beginning in September 2024.


	“We're using tech that's never been used before,” Cameron says in the trailer. “No one's shot a concert film on this scale before.” Eilish and Cameron co-directed the film, gathering footage from the tour as well as behind-the-scenes content. In the opening scene of the trailer, Eilish spies on a group of fans camping outside the venue. When she posts a photo from the window above them, alerting her presence, even more fans swarm to wave hello.

	The Hit Me Hard and Soft tour marked Eilish's first stretch of live shows without her brother and producer, Finneas. In the trailer, she shares a note he left for her ahead of her first show on her own. “It's been the joy of my life to travel the world with you three times over and watch you hold every person who comes to your shows in the palm of your hand,” he wrote, bringing Eilish to tears. “Good luck tonight but you don't need it, no one does it like you do.”

	











	Eilish first revealed her collaboration with Cameron in July during her stretch of shows in Manchester. “Basically, I can't say much about it,” Eilish told the crowd. “But what I can say is that I'm working on something very, very special with somebody named James Cameron, and it's going to be in 3D. So, take that as you will, and these four shows here in Manchester, you and me, are part of a thing that I am making with him. He's in this audience somewhere, just saying. So don't mind that, and also I'll probably be wearing this exact outfit for like four days in a row.”

Stephen Colbert addressed Paramount Skydance's $108 billion hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery on The Late Show, suggesting that his “beloved parent company” could instead use the money to “uncancel” him. 


	During Tuesday night's monologue, the host explained how there is currently “a huge bidding war” for Warner Bros. Discovery, which has “a lot of juicy IP.” “We're talking DC superheroes, Harry Potter, Looney Tunes, Scooby-Doo, Fifty Shades of Grey, and The Lord of the Rings,” he noted. “Not to mention its erotic spinoff, Fifty Shades of Gandalf the Grey.”


	Colbert broke down the bidding war, which involves Netflix bidding for Warner Bros. for $82.7 billion. “But just yesterday morning, my beloved parent company, Paramount, reportedly launched a hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros., valued at $108 billion,” he continued. “Wow. I got to say, if my company's got that kind of green, I'm sure they can afford to uncancel one of their best shows.”

	











	After cheers from the audience, Colbert quipped, “CBS, you heard the people. Bring back The Equalizer. We need our Queen to return. Why do you think America has become so unequalized?” Colbert was referencing Queen Latifah's TV adaptation of The Equalizer, which was canceled in May after five seasons, although, of course, he really meant his own show, which will come to an end in 2026.

	“Turns out Paramount got a little assist on the cash front,” Colbert said. “Their bid includes $24 billion from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi wealth funds. And when the dictator of Saudi Arabia gives you billions of dollars, I'm sure there's no catch.”

	











	He joked, “In a totally unrelated story, I'm looking forward to next season's new CBS hit comedy, Young Mohammed bin Sheldon.”


	In July, CBS announced plans to end its late-night talk show, hosted by Colbert over the past decade, in May 2026, amid financial issues at the network. “We consider Stephen Colbert irreplaceable and will retire The Late Show franchise at that time,” the network said in a statement. “We are proud that Stephen called CBS home. He and the broadcast will be remembered in the pantheon of greats that graced late-night television.”

	CBS added, “This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content, or other matters happening at Paramount.”


	Colbert started hosting The Late Show in 2015, taking the baton from David Letterman, after hosting the news satire show The Colbert Report on Comedy Central. As of July, Colbert had hosted the show for 10 seasons on CBS, filming at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City.

Taylor Swift kicked off the premiere week for her six-part documentary series The End of an Era, which chronicles her historic Eras Tour. On Wednesday morning, the pop superstar shared a sneak peek of the first two episodes on Good Morning America.


	In the clip, behind-the-scenes shots of Swift and her crew practicing and setting up the Eras Tour stage flash by as Swift remarks on the singular energy of the Eras Tour. “We have done something that no one has ever done,” she says. Andrea Swift, the singer's mother, also weighs in on the magnitude of the tour and how it was executed. “It's mind-boggling,” she says. 


	The execution of such a large production was further complicated on the tour's European leg, when Swift added her 2024 album The Tortured Poets Department into the set. “We had to be all-hands-on-deck to put a brand new era into the show,” she says about that specific challenge. Dancer Kameron Saunders, who became a fan-favorite with his dance solos and dialogue, also shares a bit of his experience in the clip. “This feels like my Super Bowl,” he says pointedly. (Saunders' brother, Khalen, is a two-time Super Bowl champion for his time with the Kansas City Chiefs, no less).

	











	The clip ends discussing Swift's various special guests, including Ed Sheeran and Florence Welch, who each joined the singer onstage at Wembley Stadium. “Every single night, we are going to do everything in our power to blow your mind,” Swift says.

	Swift shared the early look into The End of an Era with fans following an advance screening in New York. On Tuesday, the superstar gathered her family and team, along with selected members of the media, for an intimate showing of the documentary series. Swift's immediately family, including her mother Andrea, father Scott, and brother Austin were in attendance, as were the singer's backup dancers and band, whom performed on the momentous Eras Tour. Their excitement for The End of an Era was palpable, as they reacted to the series in real-time.

The End of an Era will simultaneously debut with Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The Final Show, an extended edition of the Eras Tour concert film. When the film first arrived in the midst of the tour, The Tortured Poets Department hadn't yet been released. Swift later worked the record into her set, which was then captured for this release on the final date in Vancouver. It's been exactly a year to the date of the final Eras Tour show, which wrapped on Dec. 8, 2024 in Vancouver, Canada. The documentary series and updated concert film will officially premiere with the first two episodes on Friday, Dec. 12 on Disney+, a day before the star's birthday.


	It's a busy week for Swift. The pop star is also set to appear on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert on Wednesday night.

	Beyoncé will return to the Met Gala for the first time in 10 years when she co-chairs the annual event next spring.


	The pop legend, who last attended the Met Gala in 2016, was one of three celebrity co-chairs announced today (Dec. 10), alongside Nicole Kidman and Venus Williams. Anna Wintour, who just stepped down as editor-in-chief of Vogue — the Met Gala's lead organizer — will also retain her regular role as one of the event's co-chairs.


	Neither a dress code nor a theme for the Met Gala has been announced, but the event will be tied to “Costume Art,” the new annual exhibit from the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. Per a press release, the exhibit will explore “the relationship between clothing and the body,” revealing how different body types are shaped by the garments that clothe them, and vice versa. 


	The exhibition will be organized into a “series of thematic body types,” such as the “Naked Body,” the “Classical Body,” the “Anatomical Body,” the “Pregnant Body,” and the “Aging Body.” Focusing primarily on Western art from prehistory to the present, “Costume Art” will pair art from the Met Museum's collection alongside an array of garments from throughout history. 

	











	The exhibit's curator, Andrew Bolton, said in a statement, “I wanted to focus on the centrality of the dressed body within the Museum, connecting artistic representations of the body with fashion as an embodied art form. Rather than prioritizing fashion's visuality, which often comes at the expense of the corporeal, ‘Costume Art' privileges its materiality and the indivisible connection between our bodies and the clothes we wear.”

	The “Costume Art” exhibit is set to run May 10, 2026, through Jan. 10, 2027. It will be the first exhibit at the Met Museum's new gallery space adjacent to the Great Hall. 


	As co-chairs, Beyoncé, Kidman, Williams, and Wintour will help lead the event, though they aren't the only celebs involved. Zoë Kravitz and fashion designer Anthony Vaccarello will co-chair the gala's host committee, with members including Sabrina Carpenter, Doja Cat, Misty Copeland, Lena Dunham, Sam Smith, Lisa, Teyana Taylor, Elizabeth Debicki, and more. Additional host committee members will be announced at a later date.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q='unidentified+flying+objects'","UFOs Are 'Switching Our Nuclear Weapons On And Off', Source Claims","https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ufos-are-switching-our-nuclear-weapons-off-source-claims-1762011","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 15:12:00 GMT","

It is the allegation that transforms an ordinary government conspiracy theory into a high-level security scandal: that a shadow government, operating deep within the US establishment, has been withholding evidence of contact with non-human intelligence — and not even the sitting president of the United States was privy to the secret.

This astonishing revelation has been made by none other than Marco Rubio, whom the documentary describes as the nation's top diplomat, aged 54. Rubio's claims form the cornerstone of a new and explosive documentary, The Age of Disclosure, which began streaming on Prime Video on Nov. 21.

For decades, the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), now formally referred to as Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), has been dismissed as the domain of cranks and fringe theorists. But when one of America's most senior officials goes on record claiming a cover-up, the narrative changes entirely.

The documentary lays bare the chilling extent of this alleged secrecy. Rubio directly accuses rogue elements of the government of deliberately concealing crucial national security information. He highlighted highly unsettling incursions over sensitive sites, stating, 'We've had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities – and it's not ours'.

The most breathtaking accusation from the top diplomat is the belief that classified programmes involving the study and reverse-engineering of UAP technology have been intentionally shielded from presidential oversight for generations.

Dan Farah, the producer and director of The Age of Disclosure, admitted the claim left him staggered. 'This was pretty shocking to hear someone of Rubio's level making that allegation,' Farah said. Dr. Bill Birnes, the New York Times best-selling author of UFOs and the White House, echoed this sentiment, arguing that the certainty in Rubio's voice is deeply significant.

'For someone of Rubio's level to make that accusation in public with such certainty says a lot about what's been kept secret for decades from everyone – and, apparently, even the president', the ufologist observed. He optimistically added: 'it also tells me the veil of secrecy and shadows that has kept the public in the dark so long is finally beginning to lift'.

Indeed, the tide of governmental secrecy has been turning. Over recent years, the US government has moved away from generations of outright denial and cover-ups. The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has officially logged over 1,600 sightings of UAPs over the last four years alone. Furthermore, the US Congress has been compelled to hold three public hearings featuring remarkable testimonies from retired and active military whistleblowers, all detailing unsettling encounters that defy conventional explanation.

The accounts relayed in the documentary move beyond grainy footage and into terrifying military capabilities. Sources claim that many UAPs appear to defy the known laws of physics, demonstrating instantaneous acceleration and seemingly impossible manoeuvres. Crucially, military whistleblowers told Farah that some of these crafts were even able to 'switch our nuclear weapons on and off'.

The testimony becomes profoundly uncomfortable when focusing on the non-human element. Jay Stratton, the onetime director of the government's UAP Task Force, offered a chilling direct quote in the film: 'I have seen, with my own eyes, non-human craft and non-human beings'.

But why the sudden surge in contact and sightings? Farah attributes the skyrocketing number of incidents in recent decades to a growing curiosity — or perhaps concern — from non-human intelligence about our own planet. He draws a sobering comparison between human advancement and ethics. 'We've evolved technologically very rapidly over the last 80 years, but our morals have not really [kept pace],' he noted.

This disparity, Farah concludes, positions humanity as a potential threat to the wider cosmic neighbourhood. 'We're [still] a violent species, threatening war on sovereign nations... and we can [thus] be perceived as a potential threat'.

The ultimate implication of Rubio's stunning testimony and the wider evidence presented is clear: the secrecy wasn't merely about managing public panic, but about a terrifying struggle for power and information deep within the heart of the world's most powerful nation — a struggle where the president himself may have been deemed a risk.

The extraordinary testimony from top diplomat Marco Rubio and military whistleblowers lays bare a national security nightmare that transcends political boundaries. The alleged ability of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena to breach the most restricted airspace and, critically, interfere with our nuclear arsenal — the ultimate deterrent — presents an existential threat.

The veil of secrecy, which has for generations prioritised institutional control over democratic accountability, is finally lifting. For the safety of the world and the integrity of its government, the public must now take action.

Another day, another UFO sighting.

A remarkable video captured Nov. 29 in Orizaba, Mexico, offers an incredibly clear view of a triangular UFO hovering over the city in the night. Local witness Ikal Cuauhtli Iktan recorded the sighting, which was later reported by regional media.

In the footage, the object first appears as an intensely bright point of light high above. Upon zooming in, it resolves into a distinct triangular formation of five lights, with a brighter central glow at its core. (RELATED: Live Cameras Catch Potential UFOs Over Popular Surf Spot In California)

Since Iktan uploaded the video just days following the sighting, it has rapidly spread across Mexican social media. Many users are convinced the triangular object is extraterrestrial, while skeptics counter that it's far more likely a drone.

You decide … you can watch the eerie video here.

Jason Blum and James Wan, who merged their production companies (Blumhouse and Atomic Monster) in 2024, will produce the new Paranormal Activity project alongside original director, Oren Peli.

LOS ANGELES, CA - JANUARY 29: Producer Jason Blum attends the Film Independent's Spirit Awards screening of 'Paranormal Activity' at Regal 14 at LA Live Downtown on January 29, 2010 in Los Angeles, California.

Paranormal Activity, the found footage horror film franchise that launched Blumhouse to Hollywood super-stardom, is coming back to haunt audiences, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed Dec. 3.

The project hails from producers Jason Blum and James Wan, who merged their two production banners—Blumhouse and Atomic Monster—in 2024 for all things horror. Oren Peli, who directed the original installment all the way back in 2007, is also producing via Solana Films. Paramount Pictures has agreed to co-finance, co-produce, and distribute the eventual feature.

Steven Schneider, Michael Clear, and Judson Scott are executive producers.

“I've been a huge admirer of Paranormal Activity since the brilliant first movie, with its creeping slow burn and subtle ability to make the unseen terrifying,"" Wan said in a statement to THR. ""I'm looking forward to expanding on its legacy and helping shape the next evolution of this scary found-footage franchise.""

“Diving in with James for this exciting rebirth of the franchise that started it all for Blumhouse is exactly what we dreamed of when we merged with Atomic Monster. I'll be actively involved with him to introduce this new chapter. Thankfully, we're able to spend a little more than the $15,000 we had on the first movie, but one thing will remain the same—do not see it alone. We look forward to partnering with Josh Greenstein, Dana Goldberg, David Ellison, Jeff Shell and their teams at Paramount as we bring Paranormal Activity back to life.”

Ironically, Blum seemed to have exhausted all personal interest in the IP just three years ago when he said, “It has been enough already. That last Paranormal Activity movie was terrible."" He went on to clarify his statement with, ""It would come back if some director I love, like Scott Derrickson, said: 'I have a great idea for a Paranormal Activity movie.' But it's not something I want to do [at the moment].”

Paranormal Activity opened this week in movie historyJason Blum on Why Five Nights at Freddy's Reminds Him of His Paranormal Activity DaysChosen one of the day: The oscillating fan from Paranormal Activity 3

There are no plot details available at this time.



Like Blum said, the original entry was made on a meager budget, though the box office returns—nearly $200 million worldwide—were anything but paltry. The success of Paranormal Activity launched an entire series that currently spans seven titles, which have grossed a cumulative $890 million globally. The most recent sequel, subtitled Next of Kin and written by Christopher Landon (Happy Death Day, Freaky), received a straight-to-streaming debut on Paramount+ in 2021.

“We're thrilled to reignite the iconic Paranormal Activity franchise with two of the horror genre's most visionary talents, James and Jason,” said Paramount Pictures co-chairs Josh Greenstein and Dana Goldberg. ""Jason's role in shaping this franchise into a global cultural touchstone, together with James' singular taste and track record for innovative storytelling, sets the stage for a thrilling new chapter.""

When it comes to literary masterpieces, Bram Stoker's Dracula will forever be in the running. The most notable vampire story, Dracula has produced countless derivative takes on the tale, including a Zenescope Entertainment comic book series titled Helsing. Well, the graphic novels soon caught the eye of Neil LaBute, who distilled the basic concept into a five-season series that first aired on SYFY back in 2016. If you haven't given Van Helsing a shot, it's a vampire thriller that is different from Dracula in nearly every way, but remains a fascinating fantasy world worthy of exploration. Now that the whole series is on Netflix, there's no better time.

Only a few months after its contemporary, Wynonna Earp, was doing something similar on the network, Van Helsing aired on SYFY with a pulse-pounding pilot that felt like The Walking Dead meets the world of vampires. Despite its title, Van Helsing has little to do with the traditional Dracula story, instead largely focusing on a woman named Vanessa Stewart (Kelly Overton), who was attacked by a vampire and left in a coma for three years, only awaking after the world has been ravaged by the undead. Vanessa soon discovers that she is actually a Van Helsing, having come from a long lineage of vampire hunters, tracing back to Abraham Van Helsing (Michael Eklund) himself. But what you think you know about the Dracula legend is flipped on its head come the fourth season, when it's revealed that the Dark One is not what any of us thought. Miraculously, it's through Vanessa's blood that vampires can be redeemed, becoming human once more.

After an event dubbed The Rising, the supervolcano below Yellowstone National Park erupted, blackening out the sky in the Western part of North America and prompting a legion of vampires to come out from hiding. The undead largely took over places like Seattle, where our heroes begin their journey, only to expand throughout the continent. Joining up with a group of survivors, including the ex-Marine Axel Miller (Jonathan Scarfe), scientist ""Doc"" Carol (Rukiya Bernard), their young companion Mohammad (Trezzo Mahoro), the deaf Sam (Christopher Heyerdahl), and the former vampire ""Flesh"" (Vincent Gale), Vanessa begins the series by hunting for her missing daughter. Of course, as the show progresses, the world expands to include vampiric serial killers, groups of surviving clans, shady government organizations, and the attempted reformation of the post-Rising United States, not to mention the introduction of Vanessa's long-lost sister, Scarlett Harker (Missy Peregrym).

What was always compelling about Van Helsing was that, unlike the Zenescope comic it's based on, Vanessa is not automatically a badass vampire warrior. Over the course of the first few seasons, we see her learn and grow and go from a vampire novice to a pro. ""I did not want to play a character that came out of the gate just as this monster killing machine that was impenetrable,"" Kelly Overton told Collider in a 2016 interview. ""I really wanted to make her a real person with strengths and weaknesses. The vulnerability was really important to me and, in fact, was one of the biggest challenges for me, in playing Vanessa.""

As Van Helsing continued, the show morphed from a survivalist vampire thriller into something a bit more fantastical. Elements such as prophetic visions and utterances, mystical books, and even time travel made their way into the SYFY drama, which aimed to connect the series even further to the original Dracula source material — but only to a point. Van Helsing never claims to be a direct adaptation of Bram Stoker's story, nor does it attempt to honor the long legacy of the monstrous Count in the same way that, say, Hugh Jackman's Van Helsing (which attempted its own TV spin-off back in the day) did. Instead, the SYFY series carved its own legacy over the course of five seasons on the network, growing more cinematic the more the television landscape changed.

Midway through Van Helsing's fourth season, the series makes an odd change that it never quite recovers from. Introducing newcomers Jack (Nicole Muñoz) and Violet (Keeya King), it effectively writes its leading lady off the show. While Overton took an absence from Van Helsing due to her own off-screen journey through motherhood, the series reflected that change in its ushering of Jack and Violet into the forefront of the program, drastically shifting the feel of the story in its eleventh hour. It's not until the last five episodes of the fifth and final season that Overton returns, just in time for Van Helsing to come to a close. While there's little denial that the first three seasons of Van Helsing are its best, the fifth season concludes the centuries-long battle between the Van Helsing clan and Dracula (played by Battlestar Galactica's Tricia Helfer), giving a true finality to the series.

While Wynonna Earp would go on to get a TV movie reunion, Van Helsing ends with the open-ended possibility of more, but no actual need to pursue the story further. For some, that may be a bit of a disappointment, but in an age where far too many shows are canceled on cliffhangers and without any proper conclusion, this is (thankfully) not one of them. If you're looking for a new and engaging take on the traditional vampire story that tosses most of the tradition altogether, SYFY's Van Helsing may be the vampire show on Netflix for you.

Van Helsing is available for streaming on Netflix.

Radiation causes subsurface chemical reactions, which could act as “food” for some lifeforms. 

Some scientists believe life could be hiding in our own solar system. But how could that be if there are no other planets or moons that mirror the conditions of our utopic blue dot? After all, Earth has a stable rotation, the perfect cocktail of atmospheric gases, and crucially, a strong magnetic field that keeps solar radiation from completely frying us. Turns out, new research suggests that conditions we humans would consider far-from-perfect may actually power interstellar life, meaning the search for extraterrestrials just got a whole lot bigger—and scientists might have already seen success.  

A paper published in the International Journal of Astrobiology this past July suggests that high-energy particle clusters, called galactic cosmic rays, that fly through space could sustain life on extraterrestrial worlds. These rays emit radiation that can trigger chemical reactions—a process known as radiolysis—which in turn causes molecules to break down and release byproducts that may serve as fuel for living things.  

🔮 Check Out Our New Video Series, Pop Mech Explains: PrecognitionYou've probably had that eerie feeling before—knowing what's about to happen before it actually does. Flashes of deja vu. A text from someone you were just thinking about. A dream predicting the future. Coincidence? Or something deeper? Across four chapters, we investigate the science and speculation behind those “gut feelings.” Go Down the Rabbit Hole With Us 

The research team focused on three worlds: Mars as well as two of Jupiter and Saturn's respective moons, Europa and Enceladus. To understand how many theoretical cells galactic cosmic rays could support, the team simulated cosmic rays breaking down water molecules at different depths on each world. In their analysis, they specifically studied the production of electrons, which are key players in energy production for all living things. 

The team modeled the simulation after our current understanding of extremophiles, a type of organism on Earth which thrive in extreme environments. For instance, scientists understand that a bacterium called Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator gets energy from “eating” the radioactive decay of uranium. On Earth, some of these radiation-resistant extremophiles hide underground to avoid the brunt of the radiation—like how humans would hide away in a fallout shelter—which is why researchers tested on subsurface conditions.   

The study showed that Enceldus' conditions hold the most promise for sustaining life. The research team predicts that the moon is capable of supporting as many as 42,900 cells per cubic centimeter at a depth of two feet, Mars can support 11,600 cells at just over half a meter below the surface, and Europa can support 4,200 cells at one meter deep. 

The theoretical life on these worlds would be neither walking, talking green aliens nor a flourishing ecosystem. Instead, we would likely see early forms of life, like microbes, because there is just enough energy to keep basic organisms afloat. Still, life has to start somewhere. Moreover, the possibility that radiation is sustaining extraterrestrial life is exciting for researchers because it “expands our search, the potential where life can exist,” Dimitra Atri, PhD, co-author of the paper, tells Science News. 

Worlds that we would have otherwise thought uninhabitable—either because they did not lie within their star's habitable zone, or because they didn't orbit a star at all—could now be viable places to search for life. And scientists may have already seen the fruits of their labor when it comes to looking elsewhere in the cosmos. Published in the journal Nature Astronomy this October, another recent study found organic compounds in ice samples from Enceladus' frozen surface, renewing hope that the moon's oceans hold life. 

During a close fly-by in 2008, Enceladus ejected the ice fragments from its surface, and Cassini, an unmanned spacecraft, collected them for analysis. The team's analysis revealed that Enceladus is emitting more carbon-based substances than previously thought, meaning life isn't necessarily there, but the ingredients for it certainly are. 

“I really like Enceladus because it has all the conditions that are at the same place at the time for life to evolve and to thrive,” Caroline Freissinet, PhD, astrobiologist with the French Center for Scientific Research, tells The Guardian. 

However, astrobiologists who are excited about the recent findings on Enceladus point toward hydrothermal vents, rather than Atri's radiation theory, as the driving energy source for life on the moon. Still, finding cells elsewhere in our solar system would prove something revolutionary: life isn't just a random, one-time occurrence—it's likely all across the universe.

Elon Musk has reignited the long-running debate over UFOs, telling Tucker Carlson that most sightings are not evidence of extraterrestrial visitors but are far more likely linked to classified US military technology.

Musk's remarks, reported by the New York Post, have stunned some followers who expected the SpaceX founder to champion the alien hypothesis. Instead, he has doubled down on his belief that while unidentified objects exist, they almost certainly originate from Earth, not outer space.

His comments arrive as US government assessments also lean heavily toward terrestrial explanations for the unexplained phenomena.

According to The New York Post, Musk argued that while people are indeed observing objects in the sky, these sightings do not point to alien visitors. Instead, he claimed they are 'probably' linked to secret US weapons and aircraft programmes.

Elon Musk says he has seen no evidence that aliens exist and has asked senior members of the SpaceX team about it, all of whom say they have never seen any.He suggests that many UFO sightings could simply be advanced weapons programs by the United States government. pic.twitter.com/UxcHp9nV3d

Speaking to Carlson, Musk said many UFO reports involve actual objects but insisted none resemble extraterrestrial craft.

He said there are 'a bunch of classified programmes that are underway.' He suggested some of the sightings may involve advanced test aircraft or missile systems operated by the US military.

Musk also pointed to his vantage point as head of SpaceX, which operates the Starlink satellite network.

He said the company has 'roughly 6,000 satellites' orbiting Earth, yet 'not once have we had to manoeuvre around an alien spacecraft.'

He added that if he ever came across credible evidence of alien life, he would publish it immediately, saying he would 'post it on X' without hesitation.

Musk's comments align with the latest findings of the US government's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which reviewed 757 reports of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) between May 2023 and June 2024. The agency found no evidence suggesting any of the cases were extraterrestrial in origin.

The same report said many incidents involved balloons, drones, birds or commercial satellites. Some sightings were even linked specifically to Starlink satellites, the system Musk himself referenced in dismissing alien explanations, according to The Guardian.

Musk's position draws attention partly because of his companies' proximity to US defence and intelligence programmes. SpaceX is working on specialised satellites for American intelligence agencies under its Starshield division.

His long-standing public view that he has 'seen no evidence of aliens'—coupled with his pledge to disclose any findings—has also amplified the reach of his statements.

Not everyone is convinced that US weapons testing explains all UAP incidents. Witnesses in some high-profile cases have reported craft displaying movements that appear to defy known aeronautical capabilities, including extreme acceleration and abrupt directional changes.

Meanwhile, proponents of alien hypotheses cite claims such as those made by whistleblower David Grusch, who alleged that the US government is hiding retrieved non-human craft.

However, AARO and other agencies have reiterated that no materials or data support those allegations.

With growing political pressure for greater transparency around UAP investigations, public interest remains high. Musk's comments ensure the debate will continue, especially if SpaceX or government agencies release further findings.

For now, the official position remains that while many sightings require further study, there is still no confirmed evidence of extraterrestrial life behind UFO reports.

Felicia Day‘s Charlie Bradbury appeared in only 11 episodes of Supernatural over a number of a years: seven in the show's world as a quirky lesbian hacker genius and four as her Apocalypse World alter ego, an accomplished demon hunter, who also liked girls. Nonetheless, the sci fi/fantasy/web content creator stalwart was popular enough that many fans asked that Day become a cast regular. It helped that Charlie was almost considered a Winchester family member, and a particular favorite of Dean's (Jensen Ackles) — in both universes.

Day was interviewed in May at a Creation Entertainment convention in New Jersey for TV Guide Magazine's Supernatural Afterlife: 20th Anniversary Special celebrating the iconic sci-fi show, where she shared her thoughts about both her love of SPN conventions around the world and her role on the iconic show.

What draws you back to the many Supernatural conventions?

Felicia Day: I started my career as a potential slayer on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so I was introduced to conventions and fan families very early. And the minute I did my first convention, sometime after Buffy, I knew that this is where I wanted to be. It feels like when your content means more to someone than just like passively entertaining them, it gives an extra level of fulfillment to an artist.

At the SPN conventions, what do your fans generally say to you?

I think what's wonderful about my character Charlie it that inspired a lot of people to either go into tech, come out to their parents, and be more confident as sort of a weird woman. Those kind of roles don't come along all the time. Charlie's an out-sized character; in the genre universe, I don't see a lot of characters like her even today on TV and I think that kind of resonates.

Diyah Pera/©The CW/courtesy Everett Collection

I've read on some fans sites that they really accepted Charlie, particularly because she wasn't going to be romantically involved with either of the Winchesters, Sam (Jared Padalecki) or Dean, but more like family.

I hear it said a lot that she was an honorary Winchester. There was a line that Dean said: “Charlie is the little sister we never wanted.” And that's really the dynamic that people really loved about Charlie and what I loved about it — because we were like a family on screen and also off screen.

The fans, especially those that come to the conventions, seem to be part of that extended family. Are the SPN conventions like family reunions for the cast?

They are! I love when I walk into the Green Room and I see my friends and we're talking and chatting either in a panel or in front of the fans behind the scenes. We're all just really happy to be together. I've been on a lot of TV shows where that's not the case. And I think it really stems from the tone that the leads on the show set. Jared and Jensen have done a great, great job of treating everyone equally and having that family feel.

What are some of your favorite memories from these conventions?

I can't tell you how many times I've heard, especially younger girls say, that “I'm confident in being who I am because of you.” I have an 8-year-old daughter and I'm seeing her kind of grow up being a little weirder than other people, too. We don't have a lot of role models like Charlie out there. And so if that can impact somebody's real life, the choices they make, the people they love, the confidence that they have being themselves, it's a blessing.

How old will your daughter be when she's allowed to watch her mom on Supernatural? 

I've actually been surveying fans whenever I see a teenager with them! I ask, “Hey, when did they start watching?” I think I've settled on 12. My kid is a real aficionado for spooky things, so she'd probably like it earlier, but no, she's seeing it when she's 12. [Laughs]

I briefly interviewed a father and his 13-year-old daughter on the convention floor. This was her second year at the convention with her dad.

Amazing, so he is a fan?

Yes, he was a weekly viewer and now, he said, he really enjoys binging the show with his kid.

There's nothing better than seeing a parent and a kid come up to me at the cons. It tends to be daughters, so it's mothers and daughters and fathers and daughters. There's nothing better than seeing that because it means that we're transcending generations. They don't make shows like Supernatural or Buffy or those kind of genre shows that are 22 episodes anymore, where you just want to sit down in front of the TV and see a family go through some adventures. We don't have that now. Everything's spectacle. Everything's eight episodes every three years, and it just doesn't have the same feel.

Jack Rowand/The CW

If you were to write a letter to the fans, what would you say to them?

I'd say thanks for keeping the show alive in your hearts. It means the characters live on, so thanks for spreading the word. Because every year the fan base seems to grow, which is a real blessing for us as artists. I'd love to revisit my character one day, and they might make that possible because they still love the show.

What was your reaction when you learned Charlie would violently die? It was a final death, which wasn't that common on Supernatural. How much time were you given to process that?

They told me, when they closed the deal, “You're dying in this episode.” That's what happened. I write a lot of my own stuff because I've been killed off many a TV show. [Laughs] At least I can control what I write, so I'll never kill myself off. But yeah, it was really hard. Supernatural was at a time of my life that I really needed to be on that set to be accepted and feel like I was part of a family. And you get attached and you want to be there more, and then you're told that you can't be there. But I know that I'm not a regular and I'm there to serve the bigger story they need. So, personally, it sucked, but professionally, I understood and I was there for it 100%.

But after that sad death in which you died bleeding out in a bathtub, you were called back!

That's the blessing of being in a genre show. I never want to be on just like a 9-1-1, because if I die, I can't come back. They brought me back from the Apocalypse World and I got to do some really interesting stuff. And yeah, Charlie lives on in many different ways, and that is such a compliment.

What's your all-time favorite episode?

Wow. Well, the Groundhog Day-like episode “Mystery Spot,” where Jensen dies in different ways during the same day, is one of my favorites as a viewer, but my favorite is the LARPing episode [“LARP and the Real Girl”] where Charlie got to fall in love and kiss a fairy. [Laughs] The set, the vibe, the costumes were just so fun. I tried to get the costume I wore from wardrobe, but they lost it. But when they were wrapping the show, they called and they were like, “Do you want any wardrobe? “And I said, “Great, I would love the LARPing outfit.” They couldn't find it, but I did get the original Charlie lion cat shirt and the Princess Leia shirt. So I do have some of the original wardrobe. I also was given, by producer Jim Michaels, the oil painting that was in the LARPing episode. So I have an oil painting of myself dressed as a queen that I'm not hanging in my house, but I do have it, which is kind of a fun memento.

Where is it?

In my storage unit. I used to have a huge storage unit full of fan art of myself. I decided that I needed to downsize and not pay that much money to for a box with things with my face on it anymore.

You said that you'd like to come back on some kind of Supernatural project, if that were to happen. If so and Charlie was in it, what would you like her to be doing?

I would be thrilled to be in it. I think she'd probably be teaching at like a community college and being a mentor. It would be one of those jobs where she could take the summers off and travel and also on the side maybe do a little anarchist hacking. Yeah, it would be really fun to revisit Charlie as a character, either the Apocalypse version of her or the OG version. There's a lot of story there that I would love to revisit.

Do you have a favorite on set memory?

There are so many wonderful moments. I can't tell you again how wonderful Jared and Jensen are in that everybody was equal on the set and you've been on a bunch of TV sets, so you know that everyone doesn't get treated equally a lot of the time. There's usually a hierarchy, you know, this person shouldn't talk to this person or this person has this job, so they're not as important as this other job. That wasn't the case on Supernatural. Everybody was doing a job together. That's how it should be because everybody contributes equally. Jared and Jensen just kept their feet on the ground and treated everyone like real people. I really admire that, and it really set the bar for me for everything I experience on sets now.

Would you describe what Supernatural has done for you, professionally and/or personally?

Charlie is important to me because she's important to the fans and we don't always get that with every role that we have. But the gift of that is pretty special and it makes it easy to be a little more picky in what I choose to do. I consider, “Is the role going to take you away from the things that you love to do in your life? Is it going to be something that you want to live and will mean something to those who see the show?” I'm lucky, I've had a lot of roles and most were written for me.

Was Charlie written for you?

Charlie was written for a “Felicia Day type.” Then, the showrunner, Sera Gamble, thank God, said, “Let's try to get her!” But it's because of the work I'd done on the web and writing my own shows that showrunners like on Eureka and Supernatural wrote me parts.

Supernatural is obviously a cult show and you can expound on that a little, but one could say that you are also a cult figure in your own way, no?

Yeah. I'll take that. I've been on a lot of cult shows. I've been in Buffy, Eureka, the web musical Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog [also Adventure Time and Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return]. I also created my own [award-winning] web show, The Guild. So yes, I guess I'm one of those people. I just love creating things. I don't want to not make things just because somebody told me I can't make it. And again, it's my work outside the system, just like representing who I am and trying to say it's okay to be like this, that influenced people on Eureka, Supernatural, Buffy, and Dr. Horrible to an extent. All of those roles were created by creative people who liked what I did. I don't get things through auditions very often. It's just like other writers liking me,

Are you hoping you get a call for the Buffy sequel spinoff?

I can only cross my fingers. That would be a dream role because it's so interesting that they're doing this and passing Buffy on to new generations, some of whom already carry a torch for the original show. My dream is to be on a Star Trek or the new Buffy. But if I had to pick one show, it would be to bring Charlie back on Supernatural, because honestly, she's just a really special character.

Synopsis: Hunting monsters may be a noble calling, but it's one that pays poorly, if at all. Flat broke, Sam and Dean turn to an old standby for quick cash when Dean suggests gambling what little money they have left at a casino.

While Dean tests his luck at the tables, Sam passes the time at the bar and strikes up a conversation with a mysterious new friend. The woman seems unusually sympathetic, and even more unusually capable of turning the brothers' fortunes around… for better or for far worse.

In the second story of the new Supernatural comic, Sam and Dean find themselves broke and seriously down on their luck. Looking for a quick way to make some cash, Dean suggests trying their hand at blackjack in a Vegas casino run by a local gangster.

Trouble brews when the casino owner starts hitting on a young woman at the bar, prompting Sam to step in and pose as her cousin. As they talk, Sam explains why they're at the casino, and the woman casts a knowing glance toward Dean. Moments later, Dean's luck suddenly turns, and he starts winning big.

In return for her help, the woman asks Sam and Dean to retrieve a lost earring from a nearby pawn shop. Though they agree, Sam grows suspicious and digs into her past, discovering she was a showgirl murdered by a gangster in the 1960s. Realising she is a ghost, the brothers decide to help her find closure by returning her ring, allowing her to take revenge on the man who killed her.

With the spirit finally at peace, Sam and Dean leave the casino with more money than they had when they walked in, and one more restless soul laid to rest.

ArtworkEder Messias delivers a solid turn on artwork in this issue. The close-up panels of Callie, particularly when she's listening for trouble after quietly tipping the odds in Dean's favour, are especially effective. The smaller panels later in the book, showing Sam digging into his research and uncovering Callie's past as a showgirl, are another highlight.While the issue doesn't offer much in the way of outright action, it more than makes up for it with strong character beats and well-observed, atmospheric moments.OverallOverall, it's a fun story that highlights how Sam and Dean don't kill every supernatural being they encounter. Some, after all, turn out to be useful allies.

What Pokémon can you catch in the DLC?

Pokémon Legends: Z-A's Mega Dimension DLC adds more Pokédex to its own unique Hyperspace Pokédex. There are a ton of returning creatures to catch, including regional and legendary Pokémon.

Notably, you don't need the DLC to actually use these Pokémon, so long as you're able to get somebody with the DLC to trade them to you. Based on our tests, we were free to trade a player without the DLC these Pokémon with no issues. If you want that Zangoose, but you don't want to pay $30, just ask a buddy!

As you go through the intro for the DLC, Mable will upgrade your Pokédex to have the Hyperspace Pokédex, allowing you to look into over 130 more Pokémon.

You can see the Pokémon below, but note that this is listed the way the Hyperspace Pokédex lists them, so regional forms, like Galarian Meowth, are not listed, though they are available in-game. Feel free to Ctrl+F if you want to see if your favorite Pokémon made the cut this time around.

More from The Sun

Scroll down to see who the mystic pig will predict

A PSYCHIC PIG has revealed who will be crowned this year's world darts champion.

As darts stars travel to Alexandra Palace for the festivities of the World Darts Championship, fans across the world will be glued to their TVs on January 3 for the grand final.

Well, all except for Truffle the mystic pig – who already knows who will be taking home the Sid Waddell trophy.

Teen sensation Luke Littler won last year, scooping a whopping £1million in prize money in the process.

Truffle correctly predicted that and is now out to get two in a row.

So who is the supernatural swine picking this year?

The foolproof method used to decide the winner saw a series of buckets with darts players' faces laid out in front of Truffle.

And she used her trusty snout to sniff out the winner.

Truffle had a quick dip into the first bucket adorned with Ross Smith's face, but swiftly moved on.

The bucket with Humphries' face on was tipped over, followed by Michael van Gerwen.

But the final bucket with Littler's face on was the one Truffle stayed on, therefore predicting the Nuke will retain his Ally Pally title.

Truffle has also predicted the tournament runner up to be Van Gerwen, making the billing a repeat of last year's final.

The World Darts Championship gets underway tomorrow.

Littler will be in action during the evening in Round One against Darius Labanauskas.


						LUK OUT!					

Christmas decorations going up and the nights drawing in can only mean one thing… the return of the World Darts Championship!

Several superstars will be determined to slay defending champion Luke Littler at the Ally Pally spectacle.

And the world No1 is set to have his work cut out with an expanded 128-player field competing for a share of the huge prize fund.

But after recently completing the TV darts trophy haul, Littler is a nailed-on favourite to retain his title.

Here's everything you need to know for this iconic competition…

Trump's brutal attacks on Europe, which follow his new international policy claims that Europe faces ‘civilisation erasure', are a boost to far right and conspiracy theorists, says world affairs editor Sam Kiley

It's official. Europe is decaying and run by a cabal of weak leaders, according to a blistering attack by Donald Trump. 

The reason for this is simple: Europe's disastrous policy on immigration means “the people coming in have a totally different ideology” which is fatally weakening the continent.

His outburst follows a new US international policy stance which argues that Europe faces “civilization erasure” and is already indulging in the “censorship of free speech and the suppression of opposition”.

These are not the latest social media post from a crank in the White House. This is the assessment of its finest minds who have just produced the 2025 National Security Strategy. This is the written version of how all in the White House must see the world and the means by which they intend to get the rest of us to view the planet.

“Over the long term, it is more than plausible that within a few decades at the latest, certain Nato members will become majority non-European,” it says.

This is rubbish. There is no mainstream population analysis that shows that any European nation will ever become a majority “non-European”. 

The Trump administration is getting its demographic guidance on Europe from the so-called Great Replacement Theory – a term coined by French conspiracy theorist Renaud Camus, in which he argues that a “global elite” is colluding against the white population of Europe to replace them with non-European peoples.

It has a powerful following among far-right groups, QAnon fanatics and Maga supporters. And now it is the official long-term view of America itself. A view that underpins the US relationship with the West and the Anglosphere from now on.

So concerned is the US that it is going to lean in and force a change of direction on Europe by supporting groups which align closely with American policies and undermining those which do not.

“We will oppose elite-driven, anti-democratic restrictions on core liberties in Europe, the Anglosphere, and the rest of the democratic world, especially among our allies,” the document says.

The Trump administration is fighting Europe's Digital Services Act, which requires internet companies, mostly US-based like Meta, Apple and Google, to moderate content, remove illegal or harmful content, and regulate disinformation. 

The White House has made allegations of “censorship” against European countries for their efforts to regulate companies that generate huge profits but are anxious that new regulations would be costly to police for them.

Vice-president JD Vance is likely to have held the pen in creating the new doctrine from the White House. Its contents closely reflect his startling attacks on Nato and European democracy at his first trip in office to the continent in February. He also threw his weight behind far-right groups and parties then.

“America encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit, and the growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism,” the new document says.

The other influence on the document is likely to have been Vladimir Putin. 

His regime has become a beacon to many on the far right and Christian evangelicals who support Trump. His unashamed claims to represent traditional white Christian values are catnip to conspiracy fans of the Great Replacement Theory.

Trump has backed Russia at every stage since returning to office. He has set his face against Europe's support for Kyiv and for arguments that show Ukraine can eject Russian forces if it gets the support it needs.

Trump has cut all aid except for intelligence support to Ukraine while demanding enormous 50 per cent shares in future profits for the US and American companies in any future Ukrainian peace deal.

Key to Putin's long-term strategy is to undermine Western diplomatic alliances and cohesion. Brexit was a major step in that direction – so was the re-election of Trump.

He, like Trump, seeks to amplify disinformation and doubt in Western civil society by claiming that governments, like Volodymyr Zelensky's administration in Ukraine, are illegitimate and undemocratic. Zelensky was elected by a landslide in 2019.

The new US foreign policy blueprint for the future claims that when it comes to Ukraine, “A large European majority wants peace, yet that desire is not translated into policy, in large measure because of those governments' subversion of democratic processes.”

Democracy has been eviscerated in America with attacks on every branch of the federal administration, the media, academia and the military. Loyalty to the Oval Office now trumps any oath to uphold the constitution as a condition of employment among officials across the US.

While that persists and Trump writes outright lies into copper-plated national policy, it is no longer possible to see America as an ally, or even a frenemy.

The truth it out there and it might be on sale. 


	By Veronica Booth

Whether you're a devout conspiracy theorist or just like to dabble, we all subscribe to at least one questionable theory. But if you're shopping for someone this season who is a die-hard, paranoid, skeptical theorist, these are the best gifts for them. These conspiracy theorist gifts range from Bigfoot research kits to CIA manipulation guides and apocalyptic advent calendars. 

Fuel their delusional beliefs, and maybe make fun of them a little bit too, with these freaky and funny gifts for conspiracy theorists. 

MORE GIFTS FOR THE WEIRD PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE: Merry Crisis: Top Holiday Gifts for the End of the World

If you know someone who is determined to crack the case on Bigfoot, they're going to need this complete Bigfoot Research Kit. It comes with super useful items, like stickers, plastic bags, tiny Bigfoot flags, and a world map. Okay, so maybe it's not the most helpful research kit, but it might just get them one (foot)step closer to finding the legendary Yeti of North America. At the very least, it shows your support for their mission!

Calling all government skeptics — the “Area 51: An Uncensored History of America's Top Secret Military Base” is a must-have, must-read for people who know that the government is hiding something serious at Area 51. The complete history of Area 51 is in this book, including secrets that they don't want you to know. Who is “they”? If you know, you know. And if you want to know more, get this book.

Help your favorite apocalyptist survive December with this Survival Kit Advent Calendar 2025. Your dear friend who is convinced that the apocalypse is imminent will appreciate this thoughtful calendar, which has a 24-day countdown to the end of the world — erm, I mean Christmas. There's a compass, fishing tools, carabiners, multi-use tools, waterproof phone pouches, and more. It's wonderful for outdoorsy folks or those who are prepping for a fireball to hit Earth. 

Real conspiracy theorists know that Roswell is a hotbed for alien activity. That area has seen some supernatural shit, and you can give your conspiracy theorist bestie a piece of that spooky history with a 1947 Roswell UFO Incident Soil Sample. They can perform tests on it, study it, or just keep it on their shelf as inspiration to find the truth, because the truth is out there. If they're extra weird, maybe they can cast a spell on it or something to summon the mother ship. 

Pesky curse getting you down? Get rid of it with this Curse Removal and Reversal Spell: Spiritual Protection Ritual Service. For less than $100, you can give a loved one the gift of a curse-free life if they've been bewitched by an evil soothsayer or moody DMV employee. All they have to do is give their name, and this Etsy witch will work her magic to remove the hex so they can go about their life. 

We generally refer to “aliens” as one population, but this book discusses the many types of extraterrestrial creatures, including benevolent and malevolent races. Help the alien-truther in your life understand what aliens are good and bad, so they can befriend the right ones. “The Extraterrestrial Species Almanac: The Ultimate Guide to Greys, Reptilians, Hybrids, and Nordics” explores real and fictional alien species, delving into a total of 82 species. By the end of the lamnac, they'll be extraterrestrial experts. 

This cheeky and controversial Jeffrey Epstein Christmas Ornament has a photo of him and says, “This Ornament Didn't Hang Itself.” It's the perfect gift for your friends or family members who love to stir the pot during Christmastime. They can place it in prominent view, where it will spur endless arguments about politics, fake news, conspiracy theories, and beyond. Throw gasoline on the awkward family conversation fire this year!

Simple, but effective, this Combo Cork and Dry-Erase Board is something every serious conspiracy theorist needs this holiday season. They can take notes, draw diagrams, use red yarn to connect the dots, and solve these theories once and for all. You may need to buy them red yarn separately, but this board comes with everything else they could need, including dry-erase markers, an eraser, and push-pins to hang up their fuzzy Bigfoot and UFO pics. 

The author of the Simple Sabotage Field Manual is the U.S. Office of Strategic Services, giving your skeptical friend a genuine glimpse into a world of government secrets and strategies. The manual is the “basic doctrine for Strategic Services training for this subject,” and should not be distributed broadly. It could fall into the wrong hands, which is why it's available on Bookshop.org, I guess? Even if it's a not-so-secret field manual, your paranoid friend will still be psyched to get it. 

Nothing quite wakes the people up like a poignant bumper sticker. This “Wake Up Sheeple” Sticker can go anywhere on your friend's belongings so they can let everyone know that they're the wokest around. Put it on their water bottle, laptop, car bumper, front door, or anywhere else people will see it and realize that they've been living in a simulation. There's no better way for them to spread their message of skepticism throughout the world. 

Some adults have a tough time with Earth science, namely, all the flat-earthers out there. If you know anyone who is convinced that the Earth is a frisbee-shaped rock floating through space, give them “The Earth Book for Kids: An Introduction to Earth Science”. It'll be a pleasant refresher for them on Earth sciences, possibly reminding them that the Earth is most definitely a globe. Otherwise, we'd all be dead. If you're a flat-earther, maybe give this a peruse for yourself. 

What's a conspiracy theorist without their tinfoil hat? Unsafe! Your tinfoil hat doesn't need to be a fashion blunder with this Tinfoil Bucket Hat. The modern silhouette is clean and stylish, but it's made of a tinfoil-like material that can protect your brain from radiation waves and alien lasers and all the other dangerous things that probably don't exist. If you truly care about your paranoid loved ones, you'll make sure they're prepared for anything with this impenetrable armor. 

These top-of-the-line Trailblazer ATB Waterproof Binoculars are designed for scouting Bigfoot, spying on government facilities, looking for UFOs in the sky, and much more. The compact design makes them easy to conceal in a trench coat, but the waterproof, multi-coated design is durable enough for jumping over fences and crawling through sewers. With these binoculars, they can finally find the truth and reveal it to the world. 

We all know that the ultimate destination for conspiracy theorists to feed into one another is YouTube. A 12-Month YouTube Premium Subscription means your conspiracy theorist buddy can access all the best content on the platform, from videos trying to prove the Earth is flat to TED talks arguing JFK was murdered by the CIA. Who needs traditional school when you have YouTube to teach you everything you need to know about the world?

Not every gift for conspiracy theorists needs to be functional. This “The Truth is Out There” Hat is just a fun way for your alien-truther loved ones to let everyone know that they know the truth. They can channel their Mulder-and-Scully vibes with this on their head, whether they're grabbing coffee or heading to a UFO expo. They can inspire others to seek the truth just by adding to their outfit. 

Rhodiola Rosea Seeds, also known as golden root or rose root, is supposedly an all-powerful, all-healing plant. The government and Big Pharma don't want you to know about it. Okay, it can't heal everything. But many believe it could replace the vast majority of prescription and over-the-counter medications, including ones like ibuprofen, Prozac, and even Viagra. Plant these seeds now, and in a few years, when the truth comes out, your conspiracy theorist friend might have a robust supply of healing plants. 

The anti-vaxxers out there can show their love for spreading sicknesses with this “Jesus Is My Vaccine” Sweatshirt. It's a hilarious gift for anyone with an opinion on vaccines, whether they truly trust Jesus over modern science or they want to troll people by wearing the sweatshirt. Get it as a T-shirt, tank top, or other piece of clothing instead. Be comfy and start conversational conversations!

The CIA has mastered human manipulation. And then put it in a handy guide called “The CIA Document of Human Manipulation“. With this manual, anyone can learn how to bend people to their will and control the minds of everyone around them. With this by your side, you can become a master manipulator, maybe even better than the top CIA agents. Most importantly, whoever reads this will be able to protect themselves against the CIA's manipulation tactics.

      En septembre 1994, à l'école Ariel, près de Ruwa, au Zimbabwe, 62 enfants âgés de 6 à 12 ans affirment avoir vu un objet volant non identifié atterrir dans un champ juste derrière leur école.
    


      Les enfants racontent avoir observé deux petits êtres humanoïdes, d'environ un mètre de haut, à la peau grise et aux grands yeux noirs.Certains disent avoir ressenti une communication télépathique, portant un message sur la protection de la Terre et les dangers écologiques.
    


      L'incident attire rapidement l'attention de journalistes, d'enquêteurs et du Dr John Mack, psychiatre de l'université de Harvard, prix Pulitzer.Après avoir interrogé les enfants un par un, il conclut que leurs témoignages sont sincères, cohérents et profondément marquants.
    


      Aujourd'hui encore, l'affaire de Ruwa reste l'un des cas les plus crédibles et étudiés de l'histoire des rencontres rapprochées, souvent citée comme le “Roswell africain”.
    


      When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever recorded, opinions vary widely among enthusiasts and skeptics alike. However, several cases are frequently cited for their credibility, detailed witness testimonies, and corroborating evidence. Here are some of the most notable and convincing UFO sightings, based on the experiences and insights shared by Redditors:
    


Description: Military personnel, radars, and a civilian plane encountered a UFO. The radar signature resembled a Boeing 707, and instrumentation and communications failed when an F-4 approached the UFO. A military spy satellite also recorded an infrared anomaly.
    


Credibility: ""The radar signature of the UFO resembled that of a Boeing 707 aircraft... A military spy satellite also recorded this incident.""



Skepticism: ""He claimed that astronomical body, probably Jupiter, and pilot incompetence and equipment malfunction accounted for the rest.""



Description: In 1994, over 60 children in Zimbabwe witnessed a craft landing in their schoolyard, and a few beings came out. The incident was investigated by a well-known psychologist.
    


Credibility: ""60 plus children apparently witnessed a craft landing in the schoolyard and a few beings came out.""



Description: In 1997, thousands of witnesses across Arizona, including the governor, reported seeing a massive, V-shaped formation of lights.
    


Credibility: ""I live in AZ, and saw the Phoenix Lights with my own eyes... It was never given a reasonable explanation.""



Description: In 1986, a Japanese pilot and his crew had a multi-hour documented encounter with a UFO over Alaska, which was also confirmed by ground radar.
    


Credibility: ""What the pilot and co-pilot saw that day was also being tracked by ground radar as well.""



Description: In 1980, U.S. Air Force personnel at RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk, England, reported seeing unusual lights and a metallic object in Rendlesham Forest.
    


Credibility: ""I am confident in thinking a crew of military men as they were would not have mistaken a light house for a UFO.""



Description: In 2004, U.S. Navy pilots from the USS Nimitz carrier strike group encountered a highly advanced, tic-tac-shaped object that performed impossible maneuvers.
    


Credibility: ""I think the Nimitz/tic tac sighting in 2004 is likely to have the most credence to a skeptic given the pilot testimony and FLIR footage.""



The Battle of Los Angeles (1942): The military used anti-aircraft weapons against a ""weather balloon"" during World War II. ""The military had to resort to using AA weapons against a 'weather balloon'.""



The Shag Harbour UFO Incident (1967): A UFO crashed into the waters off Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia, and was witnessed by multiple people, including police officers. ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shag_Harbour_UFO_incident""



The Varginha Incident (1996): Several people in Varginha, Brazil, reported seeing strange creatures and a UFO crash. The military allegedly covered up the event. ""The army showed up there in large numbers, several creatures were sighted around town.""



Kumburgaz UFO: A video of a UFO over Kumburgaz, Turkey, has been widely debated. Some believe it is genuine, while others suspect it is a hoax or a misidentification. ""It looks like a small scale model with the camera shaking around and blurred to make it more 'realistic'.""



General Skepticism: Many people remain skeptical of UFO sightings, often attributing them to natural phenomena, human error, or hoaxes. ""Now that everyone has a camera in their pocket at all times, the number of UFO sightings and photographs seems to have actually declined over the years.""

The Department of Homeland Security confirmed Wednesday that it has agreed to buy six Boeing 737 planes to be used for deportations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The Washington Post first reported DHS's contract for the nearly $140 million purchase of the 737s from Daedalus Aviation. 

That Virginia company's CEO and chief financial officer hold identical roles in a separate company, Salus Worldwide Solutions, that has a nearly $1 billion contract with DHS to support voluntary ""self-deportation,"" The Post noted.

The newspaper previously reported that the Trump administration has set a goal of deporting 1 million immigrants this year.

""We are delighted to see the media is highlighting the Trump administration's cost-effective and innovative ways of delivering on the American people's mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens,"" DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNBC when asked about the Post's article.

""This new initiative will save $279 million in taxpayer dollars by allowing ICE to operate more effectively, including by using more efficient flight patterns, McLaughlin said.

""President Trump and Secretary Noem are committed to quickly and efficiently getting criminal illegal aliens OUT of our country,"" she said.

CNBC has requested comment from Daedalus Aviation.

Currently, most deportation flights overseen by ICE Air Operations, a division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, are carried out by charter-flight companies.

In this article

Nvidia on Wednesday responded to a report that the Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek has been using smuggled Blackwell chips to develop its upcoming model. 

The U.S. has banned the export of Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which are considered the company's most advanced offerings, to China in an effort to stay ahead in the AI race. 

DeepSeek is reportedly using chips that were snuck into the country without authorization, according to The Information. 

""We haven't seen any substantiation or received tips of 'phantom datacenters' constructed to deceive us and our OEM partners, then deconstructed, smuggled, and reconstructed somewhere else,"" a Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. ""While such smuggling seems farfetched, we pursue any tip we receive.""

Nvidia has been one of the biggest winners of the AI boom so far because it develops the graphics processing units (GPUs) that are key for training models and running large workloads. 

Since the hardware is so crucial for advancing AI technology, Nvidia's relationship with China has become a political flashpoint among U.S. lawmakers. 

President Donald Trump on Monday said Nvidia can ship its H200 chips to ""approved customers"" in China and elsewhere on the condition that the U.S. will get 25% of those sales. 

The announcement was met with pushback from some Republicans. 

DeepSeek spooked the U.S. tech sector in January when it released a reasoning model, called R1, that rocketed to the top of app stores and industry leaderboards. R1 was also created at a fraction of the cost of other models in the U.S., according to some analyst estimates. 

In August, DeepSeek hinted that China will soon have its own ""next generation"" chips to support its AI models.

CORRECTION: Nvidia responded to the report that its Blackwell chips are being used by Deepseek. The nature of the company's reply was misstated in an earlier version of this article.

            The Trump administration is escalating efforts to crack down on gangs that move illicit drugs into the United States, with deadly military strikes at sea and measures to toughen up borders taking center stage.
    


            But as the US doubles down on overt interventions, experts warn policymakers may be overlooking a key battlefield: prisons across the region.
    


            Several of Latin America's most powerful criminal organizations were not forged in borderlands, the streets, or jungle hideouts but inside the region's prisons. Overcrowded, under-resourced, and often effectively self-governed, these facilities have long served as incubators where armed groups recruit, reorganize, and expand their influence. Across the region, at least ten organizations were either created or strengthened behind bars.
    


            That is the case for Tren de Aragua, cited by the Trump administration as the target of recent strikes on suspected drug boats that escalated tensions with Venezuela's leader Nicolás Maduro, although there was no strong evidence of a connection between the boats and the criminal group.
    


            Founded inside Tocorón prison in Aragua state in the early 2010s, the group initially sought to impose internal order to secure better living conditions, according to a report by Transparency Venezuela.



            “There was a social frustration behind it — resentment at how the state treated prisoners,” Ronna Rísquez, Venezuelan journalist and author of “El Tren de Aragua,” told CNN. “The inhumane conditions and lack of state support directly contributed to the rise of the pranes.”
    


            The pranes — an acronym for Preso Rematado Asesino Nato (“a hardened inmate, born killer”) — eventually became the de facto rulers of many Venezuelan prisons.
    


            “They had total control. The National Guard and prison directors obeyed their orders,” Rísquez said. They taxed inmates, controlled contraband flows, and even ran external extortion and kidnapping operations. The government raided Tocorón prison in 2023 and claims the criminal group was disbanded, although its leaders, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores, alias “Niño Guerrero,” and Johan Petric, are still at large. 



            This same dynamic has been seen across the region. In Brazil, organized crime groups such as Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC) and Comando Vermelho (CV) emerged inside prisons in the late 1970s and 1990s as inmates rebelled against overcrowding, abuse, and the precarious living conditions.
    


            Gregório Fernandes de Andrade, a criminal attorney who spent 16 years in the system for homicide, said cells were so packed that inmates often piled up in improvised hammocks hung in the ceilings for lack of space. “I was often in a 4x4 (meters) cell with 40 inmates,” he said. “We had to take turns sleeping.”
    


According to federal data, Brazil's prisons operate at 140% occupancy, with more than 700,000 inmates in facilities built for less than 500,000 – a common reality in Latin American countries.
    

Rafael Romo reports on Venezuela's notorious gang that's victimized thousands of people across Latin America, and now operating in the U.S.


What is Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang Trump says US targeted in strike on alleged drug boat



            Demand turned into a business for members of organized groups, who sell inmates anything from hygiene items to food, physical safety, and legal help.
    


            Andrade, who shared cells with Roni Peixoto, one of the leaders of Comando Vermelho, and inmates linked to the PCC, says joining is rarely about coercion. “There isn't a gun to your head,” he said. “People fight to join out of necessity. These factions welcome you — more than the state ever did.” CNN has reached out to the Brazilian government for comment.
    


             By the mid-2000s, PCC dominated São Paulo's prisons. “They're present in about 90% of state units, and homicides are practically zero — the system has been ‘pacified' by PCC for nearly 20 years,” sociologist and Federal University of ABC professor Camila Caldeira Nunes Dias said.
    


            PCC also runs one of South America's most powerful cocaine export networks, supplying European markets through Brazil's ports, while CV dominates trafficking corridors from Peru through the Amazon, according to InSight Crime, a group that studies organized crime in the Americas. Experts say the work done inside prisons was crucial to gangs' establishment in the outside world.
    


            Gang leaders order drug purchases, territorial expansion, and killings from behind bars. “We call prisons the business back rooms,” International Crisis Group senior analyst Elizabeth Dickinson told CNN. “Many leaders prefer operating from inside because they're safer there.”
    


            But the disputes over achieving such control of the cells and the inmates inside them can be deadly – especially in facilities where multiple factions coexist.
    


            Across Latin America, prison massacres over territorial control have become a recurring reality. In Venezuela's Uribana prison, a dispute between gang bosses in 2013 led to the deaths of at least 61 people. In Brazil, a similar dispute triggered the infamous 1992 Carandiru prison massacre in São Paulo, killing 111 inmates and helping spur the rise of the PCC.
    


            In Ecuador, that dynamic has become even more explosive. Because of its strategic role in global cocaine exports, areas like Guayaquil allowed foreign actors — Mexican cartels, Colombian dissidents — to embed themselves in local gangs. When their leaders were jailed, the fight for control migrated directly into penitentiaries.
    


            Daniel Pontón, dean of the School of Security and Defense at Ecuador's Instituto de Altos Estudios Nacionales (IAEN), says Ecuadorian prisons are often structured in cellblocks controlled by different groups, which incites conflict.
    


            “Each block had its own economy and leadership — everything privatized and controlled by the gang,” he says. “If I have a dispute with a criminal leader, I go after his block, kill him, and take over his criminal structure.”
    


            That reality was harshly exposed after the 2020 assassination of Jorge Luis Zambrano, alias “Rasquiña,” longtime leader of Los Choneros. His death shattered the balance he maintained among rival factions. Los Lobos, Los Tiguerones and others splintered and began battling for dominance, triggering massacres that killed more than 400 inmates across multiple provinces in less than three years, according to InSight Crime.

            To gang leaders, the bloodshed is justified by profits. Ecuador's prison markets are now worth over $200 million annually — more than double the federal operating budget for SNAI, the organ overseeing the prison system, which was roughly $99 million in 2021.
    


            And the prisons have become key nodes in the global cocaine chain, offering storage, logistics, and protection for traffickers moving shipments through Guayaquil's ports. CNN has reached out to Ecuadorian government for comment.
    


            Across Latin America, hardline mano dura (“strong hand”) campaigns have become a political focal point, with politicians running on promises of harsher sentences, mass arrests, and expanded military roles.
    


            In 2024, Ecuadorian voters approved military involvement in policing and longer sentences after a wave of assassinations and prison massacres. On November 18, lawmakers in Brazil voted to approve legislation to label groups such as PCC and CV as terrorist organizations, aiming at significantly extending prison sentences for those convicted under the statute.
    


            Brazil's executive branch, however, has rejected the idea of classifying PCC and CV as terrorist groups. During a high-level security dialogue in Washington in March 2024, Brazilian representatives told their US counterparts that PCC and CV are profit-driven criminal organizations rather than ideological groups and therefore do not meet Brazil's legal criteria for terrorism.
    


            In that vein, El Salvador's “Bukele model” — built on mass detentions and the opening of CECOT, a mega-prison with capacity for 40,000 inmates that puts it among the world's largest — has become the political reference point, especially for right-wing leaders in Latin America. Ecuador's Daniel Noboa to Paraguay's Santiago Peña and Argentina's Javier Milei have vowed to replicate the Salvadoran model.
    


            Several countries in the region are similarly investing in a new wave of prison construction. In Ecuador, the government began operating El Encuentro, a US$52 million maximum-security facility in Santa Elena built to house around 800 high-risk inmates and equipped with biometric controls, signal jammers, and reinforced surveillance systems – but violence remains. In 2024, Honduran President Xiomara Castro announced a mega-prison with a capacity for 20,000 people, as part of a broader gang crackdown – including increased arrests, designation of gang activity as terrorism, and expanded role for military and police forces.
    


            Human rights groups and security analysts warn that President Nayib Bukele's mass incarceration approach in El Salvador is not easily transferable, especially in countries with fragmented criminal markets and weaker state institutions.
    


            “When you have an overcrowded prison, and there's disorder and lack of resources, you create an opportunity for criminal groups to manage that,” said Dickinson of the Crisis Group. “What ends up happening is that many individuals, especially low-level offenders, become victims of this extractive economy. Many end up allying with a faction just to get through the experience.”
    


How authorities found a drug kingpin's luxurious hideout in Ecuador



            Andrade, who was 22 when he was arrested, argues that the answer lies in breaking the cycle.
    


            “I had many more opportunities to join crime than to make an honest living,” he said. “It's easier for a kid to get a bag of drugs and a gun than a book and a pen.”
    


            “There are good, smart people in there who can't even fathom a second chance at society because they were never even allowed a first one,” said Andrade, who eventually earned a master's degree and became a criminal attorney. “If we keep brutalizing people inside, eventually they become the soldiers of crime outside.”

Speaking on a rightwing podcast, the billionaire said he would not go back and lead the job-cutting program again 

Elon Musk has said the aggressive federal job-cutting program he headed early in Donald Trump's second term, known as the “department of government efficiency” (Doge), was only “a little bit successful” and he would not lead the project again.

Musk said he wouldn't want to repeat the exercise, talking on the podcast hosted by Katie Miller, a rightwing personality with a rising profile who was a Doge adviser and who is married to Stephen Miller, Donald Trump's hardline anti-immigration deputy chief of staff.

Asked whether Doge had achieved what he'd hoped, Musk said: “We were a little bit successful. We were somewhat successful.”

Doge created chaos and distress in the government machine in Washington DC, and by May more than 200,000 federal workers had been laid off and roughly 75,000 had accepted buyouts as a result of purges by Musk's external team of often-young zealots.

The group said it had saved billions of dollars in public expenditure, but it was impossible for experts to authenticate these claims because of the lack of public accounting. It was estimated to have saved far less public money than Musk and Trump boasted it would. Musk eventually stepped back from Doge and later the team appeared quietly to have been wound down.

Musk, the CEO of electric vehicle company Tesla, who also controls social media platform X and runs aerospace company SpaceX, said to Miller that he would “have been better off running his companies” than Doge.

In a series of circumspect responses to Miller's questions, the Tesla founder pondered the outcome if he had not taken on the Doge role or expressed as much political rhetoric.

Musk was widely criticized by voices on left for taking a wrecking-ball to government institutions as part of the Trump agenda to allow for greater bureaucratic efficiency, working off a script provided by the Heritage Foundation's controversial Project 2025. He indicated the Doge taskforce was ideologically opposed to liberal initiatives such as refugee services and transgender rights.

However on Tuesday's podcast he told Miller: “I think instead of doing Doge, I would have basically worked on my companies. And they wouldn't have been burning the cars,” Musk said, referring to outbreaks of vandalism after Musk took on the role.

After an incident in Oregon in March when shots were fired at a Tesla dealership, police said they were aware that dealerships had been “targeted across Oregon and the nation for political reasons”.

Tesla's shares lost close to half their value between January, when Doge was initiated, and March, but have since recovered.

The billionaire's SpaceX company is expected to raise more than $25bn through an initial public offering next year, a move that could boost the rocket-maker's valuation to over $1tn.

During the podcast, Musk said was unbowed by his time as a special government employee, despite the falling out and online flame-war with Trump after he exited the role in late May. “I wouldn't say I was super illusioned to begin with,” he said.

Last month, Doge was formally disbanded with eight months left to its mandate.

In February, Musk held a chainsaw aloft at a conservative conference to symbolize efforts to cut billions from the $7tn federal budget.

Musk told Miller: “We stopped a lot of funding that really just made no sense, that was just entirely wasteful.”

But asked if he would go back and do it again, however, he said: “No, I don't think so. Knowing what I know now.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ukraine's Security Service used Sea Baby naval drones to strike an oil tanker from Russia's “shadow fleet” in the Black Sea on Dec. 10, critically damaging ship as it sailed through Ukraine's exclusive economic zone, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent.

The tanker, identified as he Comoros-flagged Dashan, was heading toward the Russian port terminal of Novorossiysk at high speed with its automatic identification system switched off when it was hit, resulting in “critical damage” as explosions ripped through the stern area, the source said.

Video shared by the source shows large blasts at the rear of the ship. The source said preliminary assessments indicate that the Dashan has been put out of service. 

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims about the strike or the extent of the damage.

The SBU estimated the value of the Dashan at about $30 million and said it typically carried roughly $60 million worth of oil products on a single voyage. The European Union, the U.K., Canada, Australia and Switzerland had previously imposed sanctions on the vessel over its role in transporting Russian oil and operating with its identification systems turned off, the source added.

“The SBU continues active measures to reduce oil-dollar revenues to the Russian budget. In the last two weeks, this is already the third disabled tanker of the ‘shadow fleet' that helped the Kremlin circumvent international sanctions,” the SBU source said.

The reported strike on the Dashan follows a series of Ukrainian operations targeting Russia's shadow fleet and related oil infrastructure.

Ivan Stupak, a former SBU officer, told the Kyiv Independent that the broader campaign against Russia's shadow fleet is aimed at making the trade too risky for shipowners. “They are trying to scare tanker owners away from entering the Black Sea ports of the Russian Federation and from loading Russian oil there,” he said, adding that “it is a very lucrative business, and there are many who want to be in it.”

On Nov. 28, Sea Baby drones struck the sanctioned Russian oil tankers Kairos and Virat in the Black Sea off Turkey's coast, disabling vessels that a source in the SBU said were tied to the Kremlin's shadow fleet. 

Days later, Turkish authorities said the Russian tanker Midvolga-2 reported an apparent drone attack about 80 miles off Turkey's coast while carrying sunflower oil from Russia to Georgia, though Ukraine's Foreign Ministry denied involvement and suggested Russia may have staged the incident.

Ukraine has also used naval drones to hit infrastructure that services Russia's oil exports. Naval drones struck Russia's oil terminals in the Black Sea ports of Tuapse and Novorossiysk on Sept. 24, “paralyzing” major export operations there, a source in Ukraine's military intelligence, known by its Ukrainian acronym HUR, said.

Cans of Campbell's soup are displayed along a grocery store's shelves in New York City.Spencer Platt/Getty Images

Growing up, Campbell's soup was a dietary staple in my home.

My mother would often have a bowl of chicken noodle and a grilled cheese sandwich waiting for me for lunch when I came home from school.

Not surprisingly, the same soup found a home in our pantry when it was time to raise a family of our own. My wife and I loved it and so did our kids. Doubtlessly, this same story has played out across North America, for generations.

Imagine my surprise, then, when a story broke recently about a Campbell's executive being caught on tape castigating his company's products, calling it “shit” food for “poor people.” He said the chicken in Campbell's products isn't real, but bio-engineered meat made from a 3D printer.

Gulp.

Needless to say, the soup hit the fan and the executive was fired, with the company denying it all and sticking up for its product line, which includes sauces, pasta and snacks like Goldfish crackers.

I'm sure the story had many people checking the ingredients label on Campbell's products more closely. I did, anyway. Nothing on the tin of mushroom soup I grabbed from the cupboard jumped out at me: Vegetable oil? Buttermilk powder? Soy protein concentrate? Was any of that terrible?

Experts say ultraprocessed foods are a major public health threat. Here's how to protect yourself

The story did contribute to a broader discussion my wife and I have been having about adopting a healthier diet. We already eat relatively well – fish, vegetables, not too much red meat – still, it's hard not to get caught up in the rampaging debate about the unhealthy nature of the North American diet.

It's being blamed for any number of concerning health conditions, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease and cancer. The biggest culprit is ultraprocessed food (UPF), which involves chemical modifications and industrial methods designed to extend shelf life and maximize profits. Often these techniques also maximize calories.

Health officials have been sounding the alarm about this for some time now. Even Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who heads the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has declared UPFs a scourge. He's declared ingredients such as artificial dyes to be poison – one being fed to American children. According to some estimates, UPFs make up 73 per cent of the U.S. food supply, and 70 per cent of children's daily caloric intake.

Mr. Kennedy has vowed to get UPFs out of schools and is urging states to ban the use of food stamps to buy sugary sodas. An entire Make American Healthy Again (MAHA) movement has sprung up around his efforts.

Elsewhere, the city of San Francisco recently filed a lawsuit against food manufacturers over UPFs, arguing that American cities are burdened with the costs of treating diseases that stem from the companies' products, such as Slim Jim meat sticks and Cool Ranch Doritos.

The fact is, it's not easy avoiding food that is bad for you. Order a salad for lunch? The dressing may contain harmful preservatives. That granola parfait may look like a healthy option, but could have artificial sweeteners. Something that bills itself as low-calorie likely includes artificial trans fats.

The best foods to eat to promote healthy aging, according to our nutrition expert

But there's also another huge impediment to eating healthy – costs.

Everyone talks about adopting a Mediterranean diet, but that's easier said than done. Eating fresh fruits and vegetables every day is just not financially feasible for millions of Canadians. The pandemic put this goal out of reach for many, and costs have remained prohibitively high since. Statistics Canada says grocery costs have outpaced inflation across the country for nine straight months.

While the nutrition crisis in the U.S. is getting a lot of attention, it exists in Canada, too. We are eating the same chips and drinking the same pop. Kids are demanding the same cereals that I loved growing up. One of my favourites was Apple Jacks. I never thought twice about what I was eating as I consumed bowl after bowl.

Only now have I discovered it contains hydrogenated coconut, modified food starch and degerminated yellow corn flour among other things that are undoubtedly awful for you. But it's still flying off the shelves because kids love it, and busy, tired parents don't have the energy to try and convince their children to love Shreddies instead.

It's going to take a brave, momentous effort to push back against a food industry making billions selling us food that isn't good for us. It should start, in this country at least, with a massive education campaign about the risks involved.

And then we need to find a way to make healthy food more economically accessible to the masses. Until we do, people will continue filling their shopping carts with items that cost less, but could ultimately shorten their lives.

Police and security officials were conducting ID checks in Dar es Salaam after potential anti-government protests were banned.

The streets of the largest city in Tanzania, Dar es Salaam, were largely deserted on Tuesday after police and soldiers were deployed to prevent anti-government protests on the country's Independence Day.

Presidential and parliamentary elections on October 29 triggered the worst political violence in Tanzania's post-independence history after President Samia Suluhu Hassan was reelected in a vote in which leading opposition candidates were barred from running.

Hassan's government was accused of rigging the polls and overseeing a campaign of murders and abductions that sparked nationwide riots.

United Nations human rights experts estimated last week that at least 700 people were extrajudicially killed in the violence, while Tanzanian opposition figures have spoken of over 1,000 victims of an alleged ""shoot-to-kill"" policy.

Since then, the authorities have continued to stifle dissent, arresting hundreds of people and charging them with treason, which carries the death penalty, and banning the usual Independence Day celebrations on Tuesday after they were earmarked for protest.

Prime Minister Mwigulu Nchemba urged citizens to remain at home and ""use the day for rest.""

On the streets of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's economic capital, police were carrying out ID checks while city center shops were closed.

One reporter for the French AFP news agency said he was stopped and searched seven times in just over 30 minutes while walking through the city.

And a local bus conductor told the Reuters news agency that his company was not operating its usual ""essential service"" because ""we cannot risk going out"" for fear of violence.

Police spokesperson David Misime said the security situation across Tanzania was calm and that footage on social media purporting to show demonstrations on Tuesday were actually from earlier protests.

""We continue urging Tanzanians to disregard such images because they are intended to trick them into thinking there are protests happening,"" he said.

Tanzania achieved independence from the United Kingdom in 1961. Previously, from 1885-1919, the region had been conquered by the German Empire and incorporated into German East Africa.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

China would defeat the US military in a war over Taiwan, according to a top-secret US government assessment.

US reliance on costly, sophisticated weapons leaves it exposed to China's ability to mass-produce cheaper systems in overwhelming numbers, the highly classified “Overmatch Brief” warns.

A national security official under Joe Biden who reviewed the document is said to have turned pale on realising Beijing had “redundancy after redundancy” for “every trick we had up our sleeve”, The New York Times reported.

Losing Taiwan, the US's key bulwark against Chinese power in the western Pacific, would deliver a severe strategic and symbolic blow to Washington.

The country's most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford – recently sent to the Caribbean for Donald Trump's crackdown on drug traffickers – is often destroyed in the wargames outlined in the brief.

The $13bn (£9.75bn) vessel, which entered service in 2022 after years of delays, is vulnerable to attacks from diesel-electric submarines and China's arsenal of some 600 hypersonic missiles, capable of travelling at five times the speed of sound.

Beijing displayed its ship-destroying YJ-17 missiles, estimated to travel at eight times the speed of sound, at a military parade in September.

Nevertheless, the Pentagon is planning to build nine additional Ford-class aircraft carriers, while it has yet to deploy a single hypersonic missile.

Eric Gomez, a research fellow at the Taiwan Security Monitor, said the end result was unclear when he participated in a wargame for a Taiwan conflict, but noted the US suffered heavy losses.

“The US loses a lot of ships in the process. A lot of F-35s and other tactical aircraft in the theatre are degraded pretty rapidly too,” he told The Telegraph.

“I think the high cost of it was really sobering when we did the after-action summaries, and we're like, ‘Okay, like, you guys lost 100-plus fifth-generation aircraft, multiple destroyers, a couple of submarines, a couple of carriers'.

“It's like, ‘oh gosh, man, that was a heavy toll'.”

Last year, Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, said that “we lose every time” in the Pentagon's war games against China, and predicted the Asian country's hypersonic missiles could destroy aircraft carriers within minutes.

China has significantly expanded its arsenal of short, medium, and intermediate-range missiles, which means it could destroy many of the US's advanced weapons well before they could reach Taiwan.

Meanwhile, the “big five” defence companies, a number which has dwindled from ten times that amount in the 1990s, continue to sell the US government costlier versions of the same ships, aircraft and missiles, according to The New York Times.

Defence officials have realised the US is vulnerable because these complex weapons are impossible to mass produce, following a series of recent wars, including the Ukraine-Russia conflict, which have shown the devastating capabilities of relatively cheap weapons like drones.

Congress has earmarked around $1bn (£750m) to produce 340,000 small drones over the course of the next two years.

Mr Trump has appointed Dan Driscoll, the US head of the armed forces, as his “drone guy,” charged with modernising America's outdated tech and countering enemies' drone efforts.

However, the US is nevertheless playing catch-up with its adversaries, and experts have previously told The Telegraph that it cannot compete on costs with countries like China, where labour costs are lower and regulations looser.

A decisive change in US policy would likely need substantial investment, yet defence spending is at its lowest level in around 80 years, at roughly 3.4 per cent of GDP.

Jake Sullivan, the former national security adviser, has warned the US would quickly run out of essential munitions like artillery shells in a war with China.

Internal Pentagon assessments show China vastly outnumbers the US in its arsenal of almost all cruise and ballistic missiles. Both superpowers maintain a stockpile of 400 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).

The US reportedly used up roughly a quarter of its high-altitude missile interceptors to defend Israel against Iran's 12-day ballistic missile barrage in June this year.

Moreover, China's state-sponsored hacking group Volt Typhoon has installed malware on critical computer networks for power grids, communications systems and water supplies for American military bases.

The security threat, which US officials have struggled to locate, could hamstring the military's ability to move weapons and forces if war breaks out in the Pacific.

Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, claims seizing Taiwan is an “historical inevitability” and has ordered his military to be ready to seize the island by 2027.

Nevertheless, he is thought unlikely to move unless China achieves such an overwhelming military advantage that it could effectively be certain to take the island. Failing to do so would be a humiliating blow that would likely end his 13-year-premiership.

The US has no formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan and, since the 1970s, has pursued a policy of “strategic ambiguity”, avoiding saying explicitly whether it would militarily defend the island chain.

However, since the days of Dwight D Eisenhower, it has viewed the island as an important check on Chinese expansionism, and is obliged by law to provide weapons for Taiwan to defend itself.

Mr Trump has stuck to the “strategic ambiguity” policy, although he has complained about the cost of protecting Taiwan.

“I think Taiwan should pay us for defence. You know, we're no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn't give us anything,” he told Bloomberg last year.

Recommended

He went on to note that Taiwan was a short distance from China's coast compared to thousands of miles from the US, which gave Beijing “a slight advantage”.

“That's the apple of president Xi's eye,” he added.

In the Trump administration's national security strategy, published last week, it said the island was important to the US economy because a third of global shipping passes through the South China Sea.

The US's priority is to preserve “military overmatch”, it stated, meaning that America's military capabilities must outstrip China's so far as to deter Xi against making a move, something which, according to this memo, it has failed to do for some time.

China and the US have launched a frantic arms race to prevent either from achieving a decisive advantage that could embolden Beijing or deny its imperialist ambitions.

Recommended

In January, The Telegraph reported China had constructed D-Day-style barges that could be used to bypass Taiwan's beaches and provide multiple fronts for tanks in an amphibious invasion.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Federal judge orders Trump's National Guard deployment in Los Angeles to end","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/10/us/judge-blocks-la-national-guard-deployment","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 15:41:49 GMT","


            For a second time this year, a federal judge is ordering the Trump administration to end its deployment of federalized California National Guard troops in Los Angeles and return the troops to state control.
    


            US District Court Judge Charles Breyer ruled President Donald Trump does not have the authority to keep the California troops under federal control in the absence of a clear emergency.
    


            “It defies the record – and common sense – to conclude that risks stemming from protests – in August, October, or even present day – could not have been sufficiently managed without resorting to the National Guard,” the judge wrote in the order on Wednesday.
    


            Breyer, a nominee of former President Bill Clinton who sits in San Francisco,  said he would delay enforcement of his order until Monday at noon PT.
    


            The White House is standing by its view that Trump has sole power to decide when to federalize National Guard troops, implying it is likely to appeal.
    


            “President Trump exercised his lawful authority to deploy National Guard troops to support federal officers and assets following violent riots that local leaders like Newscum refused to stop. We look forward to ultimate victory on the issue,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement.
    


How Trump is intensifying his crackdown on every form of immigration to the US



            The administration initially called up the Golden State's militia in June – against the wishes of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom – as protests against immigration raids were roiling Los Angeles and surrounding communities.
    


            Breyer initially ruled this summer that Trump unlawfully called the troops into federal service and ordered the president to return control of them to the governor, but that first victory for Newsom was short-lived. Even before the order took effect, it was blocked by a federal appeals court, allowing Trump to temporarily maintain control of the troops while the legal challenge played out.
    


            Although that appeal of the initial deployment is still pending, Breyer said he has the right to step in now to consider whether the two extensions to the order that have been made are justified.
    


            “Congress did not intend for the service period to last forever – just long enough to address the present emergency,” Breyer wrote.
    


            Under the latest administration order, the California National Guard members are scheduled to remain under federal control until next February.
    


            Attorneys for the Trump administration have defended deploying Guard troops in multiple cities, saying the protests against immigration enforcement authorities amount to a rebellion and prevent agents from carrying out immigration law. But the federal judge said in the order that is not enough to justify calling up troops.
    


            “Every protest, and indeed any large gathering of people in public, carries with it a risk of violence, however unlikely,” wrote Breyer. “But the specter of a protest that is not a current impediment to the President's ability to execute the laws becoming a future impediment is not adequate.”
    


            At its peak, the federal government had 4,119 members of the California National Guard under its command, according to a court filing, but that number has since dwindled to 300 as the situation in Los Angeles has calmed.
    


How federal agencies' roles have shifted in Trump's immigration battle



            Only 100 were still “on the ground in Los Angeles” as of October, the court filing said, with the rest deployed to Chicago and Portland, Oregon – cities where efforts to deploy federal troops of the National Guard were blocked by court challenges.
    


            “Today's ruling is abundantly clear – the federalization of the National Guard in California is illegal and must end,” Newsom said in a statement Wednesday. “The President deployed these brave men and women against their own communities, removing them from essential public safety operations.”
    


            Breyer also rejected the administration's claim that courts have no power to review a president's decision to take control of state National Guard units during an emergency, saying this was an overly expansive view of executive authority.
    


            “The founders designed our government to be a system of checks and balances. Defendants, however, make clear that the only check they want is a blank one,” Breyer said.

It could have big impacts on sea level rise","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/10/climate/underwater-storms-melt-doomsday-pine-island-glaciers-antarctica","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 12:00:59 GMT","


            Swirling underwater “storms” are aggressively melting the ice shelves of two vital Antarctic glaciers, with potentially “far-reaching implications” for global sea level rise, according to a recent study.
    


            Antarctica is like a fist with a skinny thumb stuck out toward South America. Pine Island Glacier is near the base of this thumb. Thwaites — known as the Doomsday Glacier because of the devastating impact its demise would have on global sea level rise — sits next to it.
    


            Over the past few decades, these icy giants have experienced rapid melting driven by warming ocean water, especially at the point where they rise from the seabed and come afloat as ice shelves.
    


            The new study, published last month in Nature Geosciences, is the first to systematically analyze how the ocean is melting ice shelves over just hours and days, rather than seasons or years, its authors say.
    


             “We are looking at the ocean on very short ‘weather-like' timescales, which is unusual for Antarctic studies,” said Yoshihiro Nakayama, a study author and an assistant professor of engineering at Dartmouth College.
    


            The underwater storms they focused on — called submesoscales — are fast-changing, swirling ocean eddies.
    


            “Think of these like little water twirls that spin around really fast, kind of like when you stir water in a cup,” said study author Mattia Poinelli, an Earth system science researcher at the University of California, Irvine and a NASA research affiliate. However, in the ocean, these eddies are not small — they can span up to around 6 miles.
    


            They form when warm and cold water meet. To return to the cup analogy, it's the same principle as when you pour milk into a cup of coffee and see tiny swirls spinning around, mixing everything together.
    


            The phenomenon is similar to how storms form in the atmosphere — when warm and cold air collide — and like atmospheric storms, they can be very dangerous.
    


            The eddies spin up in the open ocean and race underneath ice shelves. Sandwiched between the complex, rough base of the ice shelf and the seafloor, the eddies churn up warmer water from deeper in the ocean, which enhances melting when it “hits” vulnerable ice, Nakayama said.
    


            The scientists used computer models as well as real-world data from ocean instruments to analyze the impact of these underwater storms.
    


            They found that, together with other short-lived processes, the storms caused 20% of the melting at the two glaciers over a nine-month period. “Quantifying the precise contribution of storms alone is challenging because of their chaotic nature,” Poinelli said, but these events look to have a big role over short time frames.
    


            The researchers also highlighted a worrying feedback loop. As the storms melt the ice, they increase the amount of cold, fresh water entering the ocean. This mixes with warmer, saltier water beneath, generating more ocean turbulence, which in turn increases ice melting.
    


            “This positive feedback loop could gain intensity in a warming climate,” said study author Lia Siegelman of UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
    


            The consequences could be grave as the ice shelves play a vital role holding back the glaciers, slowing their flow into the ocean. Thwaites Glacier alone holds enough water to raise sea levels by more than 2 feet. But, because it also acts as a cork holding back the vast Antarctic ice sheet, its collapse could ultimately lead to around 10 feet of sea level rise.
    


‘Doomsday glacier,' which could raise sea level by several feet, is holding on ‘by its fingernails,' scientists say



            The study is important “because it sheds light on the role of small features in the ocean melting the base of ice shelves,” said Tiago Dotto, a senior research scientist at the National Oceanography Centre in the UK, who was not involved in the study. The extent of the ice melt the study found was “astonishing,” he told CNN.
    


            There are still huge uncertainties. Antarctic ice shelves are among the least accessible places on Earth, meaning scientists have to rely heavily on simulations. “These kinds of studies are intriguing but they are computer models,” said David Holland, a professor of mathematics and atmosphere and ocean science at NYU, who was also not involved in the study. Much more real-world data is needed to really understand the impact of these eddies, along with other ocean weather, he told CNN.
    


            There are also many drivers of ice melt in this vast continent. “Hundreds of things are of similar importance to the decay of the ice sheet,” said Ted Scambos, senior research scientist for the Earth Science and Observation Center at the University of Colorado Boulder, who was not involved in the study. “Awareness of the dynamics of the near-ice-sheet ocean is evolving rapidly,” he told CNN.
    


            The study is clear that more data is needed to understand how underwater storms may vary over seasons and years. Nevertheless, these short-term weather-like processes are “far from negligible,” Poinelli said.
    


            “Studying these fine-scale ocean phenomena is the next frontier when it comes to the ocean-ice interactions that help us understand ice loss and, ultimately, sea level rise,” Siegelman said.

Jennifer Shah, a former star on “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City,” has been moved from a federal prison into a community confinement program after serving less than half of her sentence for defrauding thousands of people.

A Bureau of Prisons spokesperson confirmed that Shah was transferred Wednesday morning from the Federal Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas to the program overseen by the Phoenix Residential Residential Reentry Management Office. The transfer means that Shah is either being held in home confinement or in a halfway house. Her projected release date is Aug. 30, 2026.

“For privacy, safety, and security reasons, we do not discuss the conditions of confinement for any individual, including reasons for transfers or release plans, nor do we specify an individual's specific location while in community confinement,” BOP spokesperson Emery Nelson wrote in an email to The Associated Press. 

Shah, 52, was sentenced in 2023 to 6 1/2 years in prison for defrauding people in a telemarketing scam that stretched nearly a decade. At the time, Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Sobelman said she was the most culpable of more than 30 defendants accused of participating in the nationwide fraud targeting people who were often vulnerable, older or unsophisticated electronically. The fraud involved bogus services that were promoted as enabling people to make substantial amounts of money through online businesses. 

Shah pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge in July 2022, and during her sentencing she apologized to the “innocent people” she said she'd hurt and pledged to pay $6.5 million in restitution and forfeiture once she is released from prison.




Prosecutors said she used profits from the fraud to live a life of luxury that included living in a nearly 10,000-square-foot mansion in Utah dubbed “Shah Ski Chalet,” an apartment in midtown Manhattan and leasing a Porsche Panamera. The government said she also seemed to mock the charges against her by claiming that the “only thing I'm guilty of is being Shah-mazing” and then she profited from it by marketing “Justice for Jen” merchandise after her arrest.

At the sentencing, Shah apologized and said the proceeds from the merchandise would go toward victims. 

“I alone am responsible for my terrible decisions. It was all my fault and all my wrongdoing,” Shah said, later continuing, “I wish I could have stood outside myself and seen the harm I was causing and changed course. I am profoundly and deeply sorry.”

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein is canceling Medicaid reimbursement rate reductions he initiated over two months ago, preserving in the short term access to care for vulnerable patients while a political fight with Republican legislators to enact additional funding gets resolved.

Stein and state Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Dev Sangvai said at a Wednesday news conference that the state agency would restore reimbursement rates for doctors, hospitals and other medical providers of Medicaid services, which otherwise generally had been cut by 3% to 10% starting Oct. 1.

The governor had said the reductions, while painful for some Medicaid patients and providers, were needed to deal with a funding shortfall for Medicaid, which serves more than 3 million people in the ninth-largest state. But legal challenges to the reductions resulting recently in judicial rulings demanding some rates return to pre-October levels made maintaining the reductions untenable.

“What has not changed is the program doesn't have enough money. What has changed is that the courts have made very clear that the rates have to go back,” Stein told The Associated Press in an interview.

The first-year governor said the reductions were unavoidable because a stopgap spending measure the legislature approved in the summer fell $319 million short of what was needed to address population changes and rising health care costs.

“The legislature forced these cuts onto the program,” Stein said. “It was absolutely nothing that the department or I wanted to have happen.”




But Republican legislators repeated Wednesday that Stein's rate reductions were unnecessary and politically motivated, carried out early in the fiscal year when Medicaid funds were readily available.

Stein “manufactured a crisis out of thin air, and regular North Carolinians paid the price for it,” GOP state Rep. Larry Potts, a health budget writer, said in a news release. “I'm glad he's finally cleaning up his mess, but it should've never gotten this far.”

Still, state House and Senate GOP leaders tried but could not work out this fall legislation to provide extra money that would buttress the program longer.

Stein attempted to pressure lawmakers to approve funds — even by formally calling a special legislative session last month. But House Speaker Destin Hall and Senate leader Phil Berger refused to convene it, saying Stein failed to meet qualifications for such an extraordinary meeting.

The governor was pushed to relent as Medicaid consumers such as children with autism and providers like adult care homes successfully sued the health department so far and blocked certain rate reductions. A host of groups representing doctors and other service providers filed their own broader challenge last week.

As part of the reversal, Sangvai said in an interview, the providers will receive retroactively reimbursements for the difference between the reduced and full rates for claims filed after the reductions took effect.

Leaders of organizations representing physicians and services for people with intellectual disabilities, behavioral needs and others attending the news conference praised Stein for restoring the rates.

They also described the results of the temporary reductions. They said some doctors declined to see additional Medicaid patients or reduced how many they would treat, providers cut services and family members of recipients had to quit their jobs to care for loved ones.

“Many practices have faced the difficult possibility of closing their doors or laying off staff, jeopardizing care for all North Carolinians, not just those on Medicaid,” said Dr. Benjamin Simmons, president of the North Carolina Academy of Family Physicians.

The Medicaid shortfall continues, however, an offshoot of GOP leaders being unable to pass a conventional two-year budget. North Carolina remains the only state without an enacted budget, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. 

Sangvai acknowledged the program would not run out of money until the spring. But he said restoring the rates means his agency is left only with scaling back or eliminating programs and services to find significant savings.

“Without full funding, vulnerable North Carolinians — children, seniors, veterans, people with disabilities — could lose access to care that they rely on,” Sangvai said Wednesday.

House and Senate Republicans separately agreed in September they would provide an additional $190 million to Medicaid. But they could not resolve differences over whether to keep spending now on a standalone children's hospital and for rural health investments.

Some GOP lawmakers said Wednesday there was still time for a solution. And Berger, the Senate leader, said separately that Stein's administration had failed so far to consider cutting unessential expenses to ensure Medicaid operates efficiently.

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on the Senate majority leader's effort to accelerate the Senate confirmation process and documents in the Epstein investigation on 'Special Report.'

Senate Republicans rammed through the first procedural hurdle on their road to confirming nearly 100 of President Donald Trump's nominees on Wednesday.

The move tees up a later vote on 97 of Trump's picks and marks the third time Senate Republicans advanced a bloc of the president's nominees since changing the confirmation rules in September.

The final vote to confirm the latest tranche of picks is expected next week. Once Republicans clear this latest package, they will have confirmed over 400 of Trump's picks during the first year of his second term.

That benchmark would place him well ahead of former President Joe Biden, who at the same point in his presidency had 350 of his nominees confirmed.

Among the list of nominees are former Rep. Anthony D'Esposito, R-N.Y., to serve as inspector general at the Department of Labor, and two picks for the National Labor Relations Board, James Murphy and Scott Mayer, among several others across nearly every federal agency.

The inclusion of Murphy and Mayer in the package comes after Trump fired National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox, a move that was ultimately found to be legal by the Supreme Court earlier this year.

It's also Senate Republicans' second attempt to move this package after Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., objected last week in a bid to derail the process.

Senate Republicans went nuclear and changed the rules surrounding the confirmation process in a bid to break through Senate Democrats' monthslong blockade of Trump's nominees and limited the scope to only sub-Cabinet-level positions that would be advanced through a simple, 50-vote majority.

But one of the nominees in the original package, Sara Carter, a former Fox News contributor whose legal name is Sara Bailey, was considered a ""Level 1"" nominee, meaning she would hold a Cabinet-level position.

Trump tapped Carter in March to be his drug czar as director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.

Carter's inclusion in the package meant that if Republicans wanted to confirm the 87 other nominees and her, they would have to break the 60-vote filibuster threshold. That outcome was highly unlikely, given Senate Democrats' near-universal disapproval of several of Trump's picks and accusations that many were not qualified to serve in the positions they had been tapped to fill.

Senate Republicans took advantage of the opportunity, however, and moved instead to offer a new, more beefed-up package that added nine more nominees.

Miami Republican Committeewoman Angie Wong explains how President Trump's backing of mayoral hopeful Emilio Gonzalez has turned a sleepy Miami race into a proxy fight over keeping the city red, voter turnout and Democratic momentum. 

Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller has been re-elected to lead New Mexico's largest city, according to the unofficial results from the Bernalillo County clerk's office. 

While officially nonpartisan, Tuesday's runoff carried a clear ideological split as Keller faced a challenge from his right in former Sheriff Darren White, who cast himself as the law-and-order candidate promising to restore public safety.

Keller defended his record on crime and homelessness, ultimately securing a third term to continue leading the blue city through the next four years as it confronts public safety and housing challenges.

Keller and White advanced from a 7-candidate field on Election Day on Nov. 5, 2025, when other high-stakes mayoral races were playing out across the United States, from Seattle to New York City. Because neither candidate received more than 50% of the vote, the mayoral contest advanced to Tuesday's runoff election.

Despite Albuquerque's officially nonpartisan mayoral election, Keller aligns with the Democratic Party while White is a Republican.

""Thank you for believing in this campaign, in our city, and in the work ahead. I'm honored to earn your trust for another historic term, and I'm ready to keep delivering progress for every community in our city. Let's get back to work, together,"" Keller said Tuesday night after securing a third term.

THE RESULTS ARE IN: 2025'S BIGGEST WINNER AND LOSERS FROM THE OFF-YEAR ELECTIONS

""While we are disappointed by the final result, we have no regrets. We walk with our heads held high, proud of the movement we built and the issues we helped elevate,"" White posted on X.

Both candidates made public safety and housing central to their campaigns as Albuquerque has struggled with some of the highest violent-crime rates in the region and a homelessness crisis.

Keller is a former state senator and auditor who has served as mayor of Albuquerque since 2017, while White is the programming manager for a local radio station, the former chief public safety officer for Albuquerque and lost a congressional race as a Republican in 2008.

According to Keller's campaign website, he ran for re-election, in part, because Albuquerque ""needs strong, reliable leadership"" to ""stand up"" against President Donald Trump's sweeping, second-term agenda.

Earlier this year, Keller issued an executive order ""reaffirming Albuquerque's longstanding commitment as an immigrant-friendly city and outlined specific actions to safeguard the rights and safety of immigrant and refugee communities,"" amid Trump's nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration.

""He's done the real work to repair decades-long challenges holding our city back. Now we know what's working — and it's time to press the pedal down and move Albuquerque forward through these tough times,"" Keller touted on his campaign website, as he pointed to ""tough times"" locally and nationally.

Keller leaned on his record throughout the campaign, including his efforts to combat crime, reform homelessness and housing services and his ""breakthrough achievements,"" including public safety and community investment projects, as outlined on his website.

The mayor also highlighted his initiatives to reform the city's emergency response system, invest in neighborhoods, fight for survivors of sexual violence, modernize the economy, leadership on ""climate action"" including a commitment to being ""100% renewable by 2025,"" expanding youth programs and ""leading with courage"" through the COVID-19 pandemic, per his campaign website.

Meanwhile, White emphasized his law enforcement experience as a U.S. Army veteran who has served as ""the head of the New Mexico State Police and Sheriff of Bernalillo County,"" according to his own campaign website.

Chief among his campaign promises was a commitment to fighting crime by restoring law and order and ""giving officers the support and tools they need to enforce the law and clean up our streets"" and ending ""Mayor Keller's Sanctuary City law for criminals and fight to end Catch and Release,"" according to his website.

Drawing a contrast to Keller's own record, White campaigned on cleaning up homeless encampments and addressing ""the homeless crisis with policies that work.""

Other campaign promises included partnering with businesses to create jobs and boost the economy and prioritizing government efficiency by cutting the waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars, per his campaign website.

""I have a proven record of fighting crime, protecting our communities, and upholding law and order,"" White said. ""I'll unshackle the police, end Mayor Keller's failed sanctuary policies, clean up homeless encampments, and restore safety to Albuquerque's streets, parks, and businesses while cutting government waste and making our city a place where families and businesses can thrive again.""

President Donald Trump brought Americans who said they were beneficiaries of his economic policies on stage during a speech focused on affordability in Mount Pocono, Pa.

FIRST ON FOX: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday criticized several Democrat-led states for refusing to adopt key provisions of President Donald Trump's landmark One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), the sweeping tax bill. 

Bessent argued that states such as Colorado, New York and Illinois and the District of Columbia are ""deliberately blocking their own residents from receiving"" the tax relief provided under the law, calling the move ""a blatant act of political obstructionism"" and a ""direct assault on the very families and workers liberal politicians claim to champion.""

""By denying their residents access to these important tax cuts, these governors and legislators are forcing hardworking Americans to shoulder higher state tax burdens, robbing them of the relief they deserve and exacerbating the financial squeeze on low- and middle-income households,"" Bessent said.In a separate post on X, Bessent circulated a meme casting New York's Kathy Hochul, Colorado's Jared Polis, and Illinois' JB Pritzker as ""the Grinches Who Stole Christmas.""

The offices of Hochul, Polis and Pritzker did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. It is not immediately clear which deductions the governors are blocking.He said Trump's legislation, which was signed into law on July 4, represents ""the most pro-worker, pro-family tax reform in a generation,"" noting that it puts more money directly into the pockets of hardworking Americans through measures such as, ""No Tax on Tips"" for service-industry employees, ""No Tax on Overtime"" and a new tax deduction for seniors who rely on Social Security.

Bessent said Trump's vision is ""clear: real relief for the forgotten men and women of America, certainty for businesses and momentum for growth.""

He urged the remaining holdout states ""to immediately conform and stop punishing their citizens for partisan games,"" arguing that ""the American people voted for bold change, not bureaucratic roadblocks.""

Bessent added that the Treasury stands ready to work with any state committed to delivering on that promise, ""but we will not stand idly by as this obstructionism drags down the national recovery.""

""This is about putting America first, starting with the families and workers who make our economy the envy of the world.""

The president wants new congressional maps in Indiana. Its GOP state senators aren't so sure.

The Trump administration is waging a redistricting war that would slash Democratic House seats in several states. It started in Texas, where a new map was passed in August, and now President Donald Trump is setting his sights on Indiana.

The Indiana House passed a new congressional map last week, but now it goes to the state Senate, where Republicans are split on how to vote. Trump and US House Speaker Mike Johnson are calling the state senators individually and trying to convince them to vote yes, to help Republicans secure a majority in next year's midterm elections. However, there is a growing sentiment in Indiana that DC lawmakers should stay out of local politics. And that maybe the MAGA maximalist approach isn't filtering down to the state level.

Does this mean Trump's influence is waning? Today, Explained co-host Astead Herndon put that question and others about the redistricting efforts to Adam Wren, Politico's national politics correspondent.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full episode, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

So the new map will go to the state Senate next where there seems to be some drama. Is this a certainty that this new map passes? And if not, what's the holdup?

Not at all. A few weeks ago, the Indiana Senate took a test vote on this, and the state senate is 50 people, 40 Republicans, and they deadlocked 19 to 19 on whether or not to pass this. They were seven votes short of a majority. Senate Republicans in Indiana are a much more traditional kind of Republican, a pre-Trump Republican Party. They're influenced more by former Vice President Mike Pence and former Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels. And so while Indiana is a Trump state, it's not really a MAGA state. We're seeing divisions in the Trump party that really could kind of foreshadow where things are headed in 2028.

Who are some of the key players who matter most in determining whether the Senate Republicans will pass the new map?

The person who matters most is Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray. He's a Republican who's been in office almost a decade, and he's a third-generation Republican lawmaker. He has a really institutional-minded approach, and he thinks the credibility of the Indiana Senate is on the line, and to redistrict mid-cycle to him is an anathema.

Then Governor Mike Braun. He is a MAGA Republican who owes his political career entirely to Trump. Braun was in a 2018 three-way Senate Republican primary to go up against former Senator Joe Donnelly. Trump endorsed him in that primary and elevated him, and he won. Then Braun found himself in another Republican gubernatorial primary last year, and Trump endorsed him again, and he won. Trump has essentially posted the Truth Social that Mike Braun owes him one on this. He and Trump are threatening to primary [opponents of the bill]. Charlie Kirk's Turning Point, they just announced last Friday: They're going to spend eight figures to primary any Indiana Senate Republican who votes against this this week.

When you mentioned the Senate Republicans that are holding firm, can you take me through their logic?

The argument from Trump and the White House is Joe Biden's census — it wasn't his census, by the way; it was run by President Donald Trump — [that] Joe Biden's census got it wrong. [They say] it overcounted people and it yielded unfair maps.

“There's a sense of fairness that pervades Indiana politics among Republicans and Democrats alike, and they think that this is an unfair move.”

And what these Senate Republicans are saying is, wait a second: If the 2020 census was unfair, how is it that we only need to change the congressional maps and not our own Senate maps that are smaller than those congressional districts? It sort of gives up the argument here, and it tells the truth that this is really about protecting the Republican majority in Congress alone.

How has Trump reacted to this resistance from state Republican lawmakers?

He posted on Truth Social over the weekend: How would any real Republican oppose these maps? The question embedded in that is interesting because for the last decade in American politics, Trump has said that he's the one who defines what MAGA is. But what we're seeing here are sort of ideological cleavages that suggest that the MAGA brand hasn't really filtered down to the state legislative level yet, even after 10 years, in a way that could point to a Trump-free future where the Republican Party does change and does morph and does evolve beyond its current brand nationally.

How do we think the vote is going to go this week?

It's a knife's edge here. It's hard to say what's going to happen. The White House is watching closely. There are a group of about 10 Republican senators who have not publicly announced where they're at. Only one Republican elected official who's voting on these new maps has held an actual town hall with voters in their own district. None of the others have gone public yet. And that Republican, Greg Goode, has been on the receiving end of a swatting attempt. About a dozen Senate Republicans have been either swatted or faced with threats of pipe bombs after President Donald Trump posted their names on Truth Social.

It's an incredible precedent that's going to be set in American politics this week, because if there's only one or two votes that it passes by, one of the takeaways could be that threats of violence work to shape our politics going forward.

Is there any sense of where the Republican voters are?

Public poll after public poll commissioned in Indiana show that this is remarkably unpopular, even among Trump's own voters. There's a sense of fairness that pervades Indiana politics among Republicans and Democrats alike, and they think that this is an unfair move — to have this power in Washington, DC coming to Indiana and trying to inject something on these small towns that a lot of voters just don't want.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Fed meeting updates: Interest rates cut for the 3rd time in a row but the Fed is more split than usual","https://www.businessinsider.com/fed-rate-cut-decision-december-meeting-live-updates-2025-12","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 18:42:20 GMT","

The Federal Reserve cut rates by a quarter-point Wednesday afternoon in alignment with expectations. Business Insider is covering developments live throughout the day, including Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, market moves, the 2026 outlook, and what it all means for your wallet.

The Fed's ""dot plot"" suggested one cut next year. The central bank was more split than usual, with three FOMC members voting against — the most since September 2019 — a mix of those who wanted to cut further and those who wanted to hold rates steady for now.

Check back here for updates — and tune into our live Q&A with reporters this afternoon at 4 p.m. ET.

Lower interest rates will ease the borrowing burden for consumers. A quarter-point cut could mean lower returns on investment for savers using high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit, though it would become cheaper to pay off credit cards. Thirty-year fixed mortgages, two-year auto loans, and credit card rates tend to fluctuate alongside the federal funds rate. Home equity lines and small business loans could also become more affordable over time.

Savers, however, could see less return on their high yield savings accounts.

Dissenting to the quarter-point interest rate cut this afternoon were Governor Stephen Miran, who preferred a higher cut, as well as Austan Goolsbee and Jeffrey Schmid, who preferred a hold.

This is the most dissent among Fed members this year, and the first time there were three dissenters since September 2019.

Economic projections released this afternoon show the Fed has penciled in one more cut in the new year, though not all members agree.

The Fed publishes projections at the end of each quarter, which have shown a common theme in 2025. Some committee members are more cautious about inflation risks, while others have often called for steep cuts and quick relief to borrowers.

Economic projections released this afternoon show the Fed has penciled in one more cut in the new year, though not all members agree.

The Fed publishes projections at the end of each quarter, which have shown a common theme in 2025. Some committee members are more cautious about inflation risks, while others have often called for steep cuts and quick relief to borrowers.

""It's natural,"" Powell said after the last set of projections showed division among Fed members. ""I think it would actually be surprising if you didn't have a wide range of views in this highly unusual situation, and we do.""

The Fed will cut interest rates by a quarter-point, in alignment with expectations. The move is the central bank's third rate reduction this year. Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30p EST to discuss.

Long-dated bonds in many developed markets have sold off. That's because rate-cut expectations for the months ahead have come down in recent weeks on expectations of sticky inflation and continued deficit spending by governments around the world.

""While we think these moves are overdone in many economies, we think there is still room for investors to pare back expectations for Fed easing,"" economists at Capital Economics wrote on Tuesday.

The 10-year Treasury yield—a benchmark for everything from mortgages to corporate debt—will edge up next year, Deutsche Bank says. That's because after its expected cut on Wednesday, the central bank is going to be more hawkish than markets expect. Key factors in the rate outlook the bank is watching include fiscal policy, oil prices, and AI.

Trump has consistently put pressure on Powell to cut rates. ""Jerome 'Too Late' Powell should have lowered rates long ago,"" the president wrote in a September Truth Social post. ""As usual, he's ""Too Late!""

Still, Powell has minimized the impact of White House influence: ""We are strongly committed to maintaining our independence,"" he said in September. ""It's deeply in our culture to do our job based on the incoming data and never consider anything else.""

Like most of Wall Street, UBS sees the Fed cutting by 25 basis points on Wednesday.

Brian Buetel, managing director of UBS Wealth Management, believes that the easing cycle will continue into early 2026, with two additional rate cuts expected after December. For that reason, he expects the stock market to continue inching higher into year-end.

""The combination of lower rates, artificial intelligence, more productivity and additional fiscal support from government spending on infrastructure could help the markets achieve escape velocity in 2026.""

Ahead of today's meeting, economists told Business Insider that the Fed is looking at a murky economic picture  — but there's no major cause for alarm.

Claudia Sahm, the chief economist for New Century Advisors, expects the Fed to cut rates today but remain more cautious in the new year: ""I have a feeling that if all goes well in the economy, the Fed probably is not going to be doing a whole lot because they took steps right now to ensure against the worst outcomes,"" she said. ""Then it's just going to take time for the inflation to start moving back down.""

""Then it's just going to take time for the inflation to start moving back down.""

Indeed Hiring Lab economist Cory Stahle said ""We're still off to one of the worst starts we've had since 2010 after you take out the pandemic"" from a labor market standpoint.

At the macro level, more Fed cuts would be good news for jobs. If companies can borrow money more cheaply, it would free up funds to hire and pay employees, which would speed up labor market churn and encourage more consumer spending.

Job growth has substantially slowed in recent months, and the Fed's cuts at its last two meetings aimed in part to stem that decline.

Without the most timely jobs and price data, the Fed may have to lean more on soft economic indicators. Consumer sentiment is making a recovery following midyear dips, but remains low.

On recent earnings calls, leaders at major companies like Amazon, Walmart, and more have said they are feeling the heat of tariffs and hoping to streamline their workforces. Many major employers have announced layoffs and cost cutting in 2025, with some carving out their middle management tier.

Investors anticipate a rate cut on Wednesday, with more to follow in 2026, but longer-term bond yields have been steadily rising. The 10-year Treasury yield is up 20 basis points from its November low, hovering around 4.20% on Wednesday.

Sources say the bond market is telegraphing a growing anxiety about the path of inflation in 2026. Trump ally Kevin Hassett, who recently shot to the top of the list of most likely next Fed chiefs, could lower rates aggressively if he takes over from Jerome Powell next year.

The calculus being made in the bond market seems to be that Hassett could lower rates too far, too fast, aggravating inflation and prompting a hawkish response from the Fed down the road.

Powell has been the Fed chair since 2018 and his term ends in May 2026. Trump is set to announce his successor early next year — a decision that will steer future monetary policy.

Frontrunners to lead the central bank include Trump's economic advisor Kevin Hassett, Fed Governor Christopher Waller, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and Chief Investment Officer of global fixed income at BlackRock Rick Rieder.

Fed leaders have shown uncharacteristic division in their decision-making this year. Minutes from recent meetings show that some Federal Open Market Committee members would prefer larger and more consistent interest rate cuts.

President Donald Trump has also been a vocal advocate for lower rates, at times threatening to fire Powell before the end of the chair's term. Trump appointee and Fed newcomer Stephen Miran joined the committee in August and has consistently pushed for more aggressive rate reductions.

The stock market opened nearly flat ahead of the 2 p.m. ET rate move. The S&P 500 was hovering around 6,840, while the Dow was up slightly to 47,580.

The week has been mostly quiet as investors await the central bank's decision. Major indexes are hovering close to records after climbing back from a tech-led sell-off in November. Investors are eagerly awaiting more rate cuts to help fuel further gains in 2026 as stocks head into the fourth year of the bull market.

The most recently released unemployment rate was still low, a little over 4%, but has slowly crept up this year. Job seeker frustration is compounded by a decline in job openings over the last few years.​​

Some demographics are also experiencing job market challenges more than others. Twenty-something college graduates are increasingly stuck submitting applications into the void, and the unemployment rate for Black Americans is nearly twice that of the general population.

The most timely inflation data won't be released in time for today's meeting, but Powell and his colleagues can look back on recent trends. Inflation rates remained above the Fed's 2% goal throughout 2025. The consumer price index — a key measure of inflation — cooled during the first few months of the year but began to creep up again in May.

Business Insider also asked our readers in November how prices have changed. About 200 readers responded; many said that the cost of groceries, dining out, and coffee has increased.

While investors expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points, officials will probably send out some hawkish signals to the market on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs said.

Fed officials will likely suggest that the bar is higher for rate cuts going into next year, David Mericle, Goldman's chief US economist, wrote in a client note on Sunday. There will also likely be a handful of central bankers who will give ""soft dissents"" on where they see monetary policy going forward in the dot plot, he added.

The Fed is expected to pencil in just one more rate cut in 2026, followed by one rate cut in 2027, per Goldman's forecast.

With 60 minutes until the US stock market opens, it still looks like investors plan to spend Wednesday morning very much in wait-and-see mode.

As of 8:30 a.m. ET, futures tied to the Dow and the S&P 500 are roughly 0.1% higher, while Nasdaq futures are 0.25% lower.

Minimal moves in futures mirror Tuesday's quiet trading session, which saw the S&P 500 lose 0.1%, the Dow lose 0.4%, and the Nasdaq gain 0.1%

If the current pattern of rate cuts continues, American consumers may soon feel relief. Thirty-year fixed mortgages, two-year auto loans, and credit card rates tend to fluctuate alongside the federal funds rate.

And, while inflation remains above the Fed's 2% goal, mortgage rates have largely cooled in recent months in anticipation of rate reductions. Lower rates could also make home equity lines and small business loans more affordable — though savers might see less return on their high-yield savings accounts.

Investors seem to be pricing in a ""sell the news"" reaction to Wednesday's rate decision, strategists at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note on Monday.

The bank added, though, that it remains optimistic about the market's direction over the medium term. That's because the job market looks on track to show moderate weakness in the coming months, which should clear the path for Fed rate cuts in 2026. Stronger earnings should also help lift the market higher, the bank said.

Powell has said the Fed's cautious strategy this year stems from uncertainty over President Donald Trump's fast-changing tariff policies and stubborn inflation rates. The job market, meanwhile, has had a rocky 2025.

Business Insider has heard from frustrated job seekers at all levels of the career ladder, particularly those feeling pushed out of white collar roles. This past summer, the number of Americans looking for work eclipsed the number of vacancies, though the unemployment rate itself is still relatively low.

This past summer, the number of Americans looking for work eclipsed the number of vacancies, though the unemployment rate itself is still relatively low.

""There is no risk-free path for policy as we navigate this tension between our employment and inflation goals,"" Powell said in October, adding, ""Ultimately, lower rates will support more demand, and that'll support hiring over time. And, of course, we also have to be careful about this.""

The Fed's dual mandate is to keep America's prices stable and the labor market healthy. These two goals have been challenging to balance this year: higher interest rates can help curb inflation but risk cooling down an already chilly labor market.

The Fed is also missing key pieces of data due to the government shutdown. The Bureau of Labor Statistics canceled the October consumer price index and unemployment rate releases, and the November jobs report and inflation data won't be released in time for today's meeting. December's decision will be more difficult without this information.

US stock futures are virtually unmoved as of just before 6:20 a.m. ET. Futures for all three of the Dow Jones, the Nasdaq, and the S&P 500 have moved less than 0.1% lower so far in this morning's trading.

There's a little more movement in European stocks, though nothing too drastic. Britain's benchmark, the FTSE 100, is up 0.2% on the day to 9,660, while Germany's DAX is 0.5% lower.

Fed leaders have kept monetary policy moderately restrictive in recent months, holding rates steady until September before introducing two quarter-point cuts.

Chair Jerome Powell said in the last meeting that a rate change in December is ""not a foregone conclusion, far from it"" and ""policy is not on a preset course,"" though on Wednesday morning, CME FedWatch is showing a roughly 90% chance of another quarter-point reduction.

Investors and consumers are hopeful for more cuts. Americans could see more affordable mortgage, auto, and credit card rates in the new year, and businesses would be able to borrow money more easily — a move that could juice the sluggish job market.

AWS executive Sarah Cooper has launched several companies and held roles at NASA and AWS, but she's only ever formally interviewed for three jobs.

Instead, Cooper told Business Insider that her career moves often begin with writing a proposal about the work she wants to pursue, either to a VC, a cofounder, or an executive leader, and that becomes the role she steps into.

""I have a million ideas,"" Cooper said. ""It's a blessing and a curse.""

Cooper has seen a high rate of success with her proposals. She used them to invent both her previous and current roles at AWS.

Cooper was previously the head of AWS Industry Products, where she worked closely with customers to develop industry solutions in the cloud. Now she leads the ""AWS AI-Native"" team, an AWS product organization that works with customers to understand how companies will evolve with AI.

Cooper said she wrote a proposal to pitch her last two roles, and she's a fan of the six-page memo, a favorite of Jeff Bezos. Instead of PowerPoint decks, Bezos often opted to start meetings by having attendees read a 6-page ""narratively structured"" memo silently at the start of the meeting. The founder has said he prefers memos to avoid ""hiding a lot of sloppy thinking in bullet points.""

These six-page memos typically describe detailed plans for a new initiative and are written using 10-point font. Bezos wrote years ago in an annual shareholder letter that ""great memos are written and re-written,"" and can't be done in a couple of days, though the exact criteria remains more flexible.

Cooper also referenced using Amazon's classic PR/FAQ framework. The executive said she finds the format ""effective at helping people quickly understand what your idea is and why it matters.""

Amazon describes the framework as a means to develop ideas and initiatives that enable teams to quickly integrate feedback and promote fact-based decision-making. The press-release portion spans a few paragraphs and provides the reader with highlights of the customer experience. The FAQ section, typically five pages or less, dives into the details and also outlines the challenges of building the product or service.

Once a draft is written, the creator typically schedules a one-hour meeting with stakeholders to review the document and get feedback, the company said in a blog post about the framework.

Cooper said she's written over 14 PR/FAQs and investment narratives that have been funded, as well as many other ideas that the company didn't move forward with.

Cooper, who has been at Amazon for over nine years, says she also tries to reflect the organization's values when writing proposals. Amazon's PR/FAQ format originated from a process the company calls ""Working Backwards,"" a method for evaluating new ideas by first defining the ideal customer experience and then reverse-engineering what the team needs to build to achieve it.

Cooper said Amazon is ""customer-obsessed,"" so she tries to focus on that value when drafting a memo. She said she thinks less about the needs of a specific team and more broadly about customers and the best way to serve them, regardless of what's been done previously.

While Cooper has spent her career writing proposals, many never see the light of day — and those that do don't always go smoothly, she said. In her late 20s, while serving as the CTO of a company, she wrote a proposal suggesting that the business should focus limited resources on scaling the supply chain, specifically with the supply chain involved in on-mine extraction to meet demand for contracts. The company disagreed on where to invest.

""I got pushed out of one of my companies, basically, for a proposal I wrote,"" Cooper said.

One of Wall Street's biggest bitcoin cheerleaders has significantly dialed down his forecast for the crypto.

Geoff Kendrick of Standard Chartered, who previously said he saw bitcoin climbing as high as $200,000 by the end of 2025, told clients in a note that the bank has aggressively slashed its price forecasts for bitcoin through the end of the decade.

Kendrick said the bank's view is now for bitcoin to end this year at around $100,000, implying 6% upside from the crypto's current levels.

For next year, he see bitcoin hitting $150,000, about half of the prior target of $300,000.

Here's the rundown of where Standard Chartered thinks the token is headed over the next five years:

The price target changes were largely spurred by bitcoin's recent sell-off, Kendrick, the global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, wrote in a note on Tuesday. The crypto is down around 27% from its peak in early October.

He said that bitcoin treasuries — firms that buy and hold bitcoin on their balance sheets — likely won't support the price of the cryptocurrency going forward. Instead, the token will have to rely primarily on ETF buying to move higher, he added.

""Price action has forced us to recalibrate our Bitcoin price forecasts,"" Kendrick wrote, adding that the firm believed bitcoin treasury buying had ""run its course,"" though ETF inflows could pick up ""periodically.""

It's been a rough year for bitcoin, which was rocked earlier in the year as markets reacted to tariffs, and has been weighed down by worries about higher inflation and fewer Fed rate cuts in 2026.

Its latest decline has been brought on by a handful of bearish factors, like low liquidity in the market, a risk-off mood amid rate-cut uncertainty, and speculation that Strategy, the largest corporate buyer of bitcoin, could have to sell some of its token.

Oops, something went wrong

Tom Lee thinks Ethereum has found its bottom, after the second-largest cryptocurrency recently plunged below the $3,000 mark.

The BitMine Immersion Technologies chairman—also the chief investment officer at Fundstrat—said the Ethereum treasury firm has been “putting its money where its mouth is” of late, adding heavily to its balance sheet at Ethereum's current prices. 

“BitMine believes Ethereum has already bottomed,” said Lee during a video interview with Farokh Sarmad, president of Dastan, Decrypt's parent company. “Compared to two weeks ago, the amount of Ethereum we're buying is more than double.”

The Ethereum treasury firm has massively added to its position of late, acquiring more than 138,452 ETH last week, or about $460 million worth of the prominent crypto asset. 

That marks BitMine's largest purchase since it added more than 200,000 ETH in October—all part of its stated quest to acquire 5% of the circulating Ethereum supply. 

As of Wednesday, the firm holds around 3.864 million ETH, or about 3.2% of the circulating Ethereum supply, a haul that makes it the largest publicly traded Ethereum treasury and the second-largest crypto treasury of all with $12.85 billion worth of ETH. In terms of all crypto treasuries, BitMine trails only Bitcoin behemoth Strategy, which holds more than $61 billion worth of BTC. 

BitMine also holds 193 Bitcoin valued around $18 million, and $1 billion in cash.

Tom Lee's BitMine Buys $429 Million in Ethereum as ETH Rebounds

While both assets have fallen from all-time highs, Ethereum is leading the recent rebound, jumping about 8% in the last seven days to change hands at $3,376. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is roughly even over the last week, recently trading at $92,248. 

The BMNR frontman said he thinks both assets could have big moves before year's end. 

Previously Lee had predicted as high as $150,000 for BTC before the end of 2025, though he softened his stance in the final week of November as BTC continued to trade below $100,000, adding that it could “maybe” still reach the $150,000 mark. 

Regardless, Lee and BitMine are more excited about Ethereum's future over the next 10-15 years, particularly as Wall Street has embraced the layer-1 network and its place in the future of finance.

Ethereum ETFs Hit Six-Week High as Investors Rotate Within Crypto

“The reason to be excited about Ethereum is Wall Street is choosing to use the blockchain for the future,” said Lee. “It started with stablecoins, and it was a big ‘aha' moment for Wall Street… but that's just tokenizing a dollar. Now Wall Street wants to tokenize everything, and they're not going to build it on Bitcoin—they need a smart contract platform.”

That mirrors the narrative being shared by Larry Fink and Rob Goldstein, executives from global investment firm BlackRock, who said last week that tokenization is “the next major evolution in market infrastructure.”

Ethereum is at the forefront of that trend, home to $12.1 billion in tokenized real world assets or nearly 66% of the distributed asset share, according to data from RWA.xyz. ","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

While the world goes through a surprisingly prosperous period, the SEC, lurking, has prepared a double gift for the crypto industry. On one side, brand new ETFs are quietly entering the markets. On the other, an unexpected regulatory repositioning might well shake everything up. For decentralization enthusiasts and early curious minds, this turnaround might be the long-awaited spark. And the conductor of this surprise is none other than Paul Atkins, the head of the SEC.

Paul Atkins surprised the world. By asserting that the majority of ICOs should no longer fall under the SEC, he outlined a new map of regulatory power. At the Blockchain Association Policy Summit, he specified: 

That's what we want to encourage. Those sorts of things would not fall, as we would define it, into the definition of a security.

From now on, tokens linked to decentralized networks, digital objects, or utility tools are excluded from the SEC's jurisdiction. In other words, only “tokenized securities” – those securities replicated on blockchain – will remain under its control. Result: the rest of the market might well migrate under the guidance of the CFTC, which is much less interventionist.

For Atkins, this differentiation reflects a desire to clarify, not to eliminate: “ICOs transcend all four topics. Three of those areas are on the CFTC side, so we'll let them worry about that, and we'll focus on tokenized securities”. He thus sketches an ecosystem where innovation can coexist with regulation. It is not a blank check, but a strategic step towards a more vibrant crypto-sphere.

The crypto market, in search of trust, seems to appreciate this shift. Evidence lies in projects already queued to take advantage of this legal window. Recall that in 2017, ICOs raised more than 6 billion dollars in one year. The SEC, then led by Jay Clayton, slowed this momentum with mass lawsuits against token issuers deemed non-compliant.

Today, the situation changes. Paul Atkins, by distinguishing utility tokens, digital objects, and practical tools from classic securities, restarts the engine. Under this new doctrine, a token that grants access to a platform, a service, or a digital experience is no longer automatically on the SEC's radar.

Coinbase, anticipating this, invested 375 million dollars to acquire Echo, a token launch platform. It clearly targets this new market. This heralds a new financing dynamic, less hindered by legal uncertainties, and more aligned with the rapid evolution of the crypto ecosystem.

With this partial lifting of the regulatory straitjacket, the American crypto scene regains color. This SEC turnaround offers a breath of fresh air to thousands of developers, entrepreneurs, and crypto investors who awaited a clear signal. And this time, it comes from above.

Projects based on utility or community tokens – outside the securities framework – can finally revisit their financing strategy. This is a strategic change for networks like Solana, Avalanche, or even layer 2 projects like Optimism. New ICOs could focus on access tools, subscriptions, or concrete features within ecosystems.

Crypto investors, meanwhile, rediscover an entry door to innovative projects. At the same time, the SEC retains control over “tokenized securities,” reassuring the more cautious.

This new regulatory era could well reshuffle the cards. And while the SEC sharpens its positions, the CFTC does not stand idly by. It approved regulated crypto spot trading on American exchanges, opening a second front to structure a more transparent and fairer ecosystem.

The modern-day Bo people of southeastern China have long maintained that they had no connection to those inside the hanging coffins. 

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

An unexpected sight can be seen high on sheer rock walls in parts of southern China and Southeast Asia. What may look like rock protrusions are actually wooden coffins, hewn from tree trunks and hung on the cliffside by peoples who were thought to have vanished hundreds of years ago.

Hanging coffins are a funerary custom once practiced by the Bo people of Southwest China. Shrouded in mystery, this ancient ethnic group was often hidden from the outside world. They sometimes rose to mythical heights in the folklore of nearby locals, who believed they were able to fly and called them “Subjugators of the Sky” and “Sons of the Cliffs.” During the Yuan Dynasty (1279–1368 C.E.), it was written in The Brief Chronicles of Yunnan that “Coffins set high are considered auspicious. The higher they are the more propitious for the dead. And those whose coffins fell to the ground sooner were considered to be more fortunate.”

Many of these coffins have remained suspended for hundreds or thousands of years, partly because those who laid them to rest made sure to support them with wooden stakes wedged into cracks and holes in the rock. Historical records on the origins of this practice and of the Bo themselves are fragmented. Hanging coffins were widespread in the region during ancient times, but eventually faded out. While they thrived until about 400 years ago, a small Bo community still survives in the mountains of southeastern Yunnan Province.

“Although the hanging coffin practice ceased to appear in historical records, the genetic traces left behind provide compelling evidence of a shared origin and cultural continuity that transcends modern national boundaries,” a team of researchers said in a study recently published in Nature Communications. “From this region, the practice spread to other parts of China, eventually moving southward and westward across various cultural zones.”

While modern Bo do not believe they are related to the people who were once thought to be capable of flight because of their mortuary practices, the researchers analyzed samples of human remains from individuals found at Hanging Coffin sites in Yunnan, Guangxi, and Thailand. They then sequenced the genomes of the living Bo population in She De Village and compared their findings to see whether there was any genetic connection. Most of the individuals from Southwest China were genetically similar, with ancestry originating on the coast of southeastern China. They were determined to be descendants of Iron Age Hòabìnhian hunter-gatherers, Yangtze River farmers, and Yellow River peoples.

It was revealed that the ancestry of the Bo people came mostly from the ancient individuals at the Yunnan site, despite the initial doubts of the Bo who now live in the area. What especially interested the researchers was that copper plates, representing the souls of the dead and used in later cave burials, had been in use as far back as the time of the late Ming Dynasty. This aligns with both the practice itself and documentation of the people behind it having declined towards the end of the 16th Century. After the team viewed their findings from anthropological and archaeological perspectives, Hanging Coffins are now thought to have first appeared among coastal populations in southeastern China around 3,000 years ago.

The ancestors of the Bo have the closest genetic relationship with living speakers of Tai-Kadai and Austronesian languages in East and Southeast Asia. The Tai-Kadai language family includes Thai and Lao, while Austronesian languages emerged in Taiwan and encompass parts of Southeast Asia, Madagascar and Oceania. Coffins of similar age, dated to about 1,200 years ago, also showed evidence of a population shift from southern China to northwestern Thailand, supporting these findings. Some ancient individuals from Hanging Coffins also had Northeast Asian ancestry. This suggests that there was much more interaction between communities who practiced this type of burial than previously assumed.

“Further exploration with additional human remains and archaeological content from these regions, incorporating interdisciplinary scientific perspectives, could contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the history of suspended wooden coffin burial customs in the future,” the researchers said. 

Meanwhile, in the sacred cliffs of Yunnan, the coffins and the memory of the Bo people persist.

It could revolutionize electric vehicles and aircraft.

In groundbreaking research, scientists have made a structural battery 10 times better than in any previous experiment.  

What's a structural battery, and why is it such a big deal? The term refers to an energy storage device that can also bear weight as part of a structure—like if the studs in your home were all batteries, or if an electric fence also held up a wall.

In the paper, researchers from Chalmers University of Technology and KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden reveal how their “massless” structural battery works.

The main use case is for electric cars, where a literally massive amount of batteries take up a ton of room and don't contribute to the actual structure of the car. In fact, these cars must be specially designed to carry the mass of the batteries. 

But what if the frame of the car could hold energy? “Due to their multifunctionality, structural battery composites are often referred to as ‘massless energy storage' and have the potential to revolutionize the future design of electric vehicles and devices,” the researchers explain. 

To make the structural battery, the scientists layered a buffer glass “fabric” between a positive and negative electrode, then packed it with a space-age polymer electrolyte and cured it in the oven. What results is a tough, flat battery cell that conducts well and holds up to tensile tests in all directions.  

The battery's combined qualities (or “multifunctionality”) make it 10 times better than any previous massless battery—a project scientists have worked on since 2007. 

Chalmers University of Technology writes in a press release:

The scientists say the next step is to improve the performance even more, replacing aluminum foil in the electrode with carbon fiber material and thinning out the separator. This could result in a battery that produces 75 Wh/kg of energy and 75 GPa of stiffness, setting more records for massless batteries and also greatly reducing their weight. 

Besides electric cars, the study team mentions e-bikes, satellites, and laptops as technologies that could use massless batteries. There could be further applications that we don't think of as electric at all today. 

One of the most exciting potential uses is in aircraft, which scientists are struggling to turn electric because of the huge weight of existing battery tech. Regular airplanes as well as vertical take off and landing vehicles could turn electric by using massless batteries. They could even combine massless structural batteries with solar panels in order to store what they soak up for later use.

The renowned Chankillo site keeps getting more intriguing.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Studying the sun, moon, and stars was obviously a more complex endeavor in the ancient world than it is now, but thanks to a fresh discovery at an already famous astrological site on the north-central coast of Peru, we have a better idea of just how complex. 

The Chankillo Archaeoastronomical Complex in Peru was known as the oldest observatory in the Americas and the Western Hemisphere, but this new find might have beaten it on the very same ground. 

According to a translated statement from the Peruvian Ministry of Culture, a fresh discovery at the site is even older than the well-known Chankillo Solar Observatory, which was built around 250 B.C.E. and is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  

The research team must still perform radiocarbon dating to pinpoint the exact age of the newly found evidence at the site, which is located in Peru's Casma Valley along the northcentral coast in the Andes Mountains, but thanks to the solar orientation, stratigraphy, and construction materials, experts are certain it was built with not only an astronomical function, but one that predates the Chankillo Solar Observatory, potentially by multiple centuries. 

The ministry wrote that the existence of both observatories “solidify Casma's position as one of the world's most important ancient astronomical centers.” 

The UNESCO site is home to the Chankillo Solar Observatory, a 13-tower complex, and a triple-walled hilltop complex known as the Fortified Temple. 

“The site shows great innovation by using the solar cycle and an artificial horizon to mark the solstices, the equinoxes, and every other date within the year with a precision of one to two days,” UNESCO wrote about the Chankillo Solar Observatory. “It is thus a testimony to the culmination of a long historical evolution of astronomical practices in the Casma Valley.” 

The new find features a corridor intentionally aligned with the lunar cycle, indicating the ancient complex had both a solar and lunar observation function. The dual purpose of both solar and lunar observations—lunar observation is considered a trickier endeavor than solar tracking—signify a more intense astronomical understanding than previously believed. 

Archaeologists also located a Patazca-style ceremonial vessel within the new find. The vessel, about three feet tall with clay figures of warriors in combat positions, suggests that cultural elites were involved with goings-on at the complex, perhaps combined astronomical knowledge with military leadership. The vessel may reinforce the political and ritual function of the Fortified Temple, all while the new discovery further expands our knowledge of ancient world's relationship to the exploration of our solar system.

Beneath Earth's molten outer core is a dense central region -- the inner core, a compact sphere made of an iron and light-element alloy squeezed by more than 3.3 million atmospheres and heated to temperatures comparable to the Sun's surface. For many years, researchers have struggled to explain its unusual behavior. Even though the inner core is solid, it behaves like a softened metal, slowing seismic shear waves and displaying a Poisson's ratio more similar to butter than to steel. This paradox raised a fundamental question: how can the planet's solid center appear firm yet strangely pliable?

A major study published in National Science Review offers a strong explanation. The research team reports that Earth's inner core is not behaving like a conventional solid -- instead, it exists in a superionic state in which light elements move through a stable iron framework as if they were liquid. This finding reshapes our picture of the planet's deepest layer.

The investigation, led by Prof. Youjun Zhang and Dr. Yuqian Huang of Sichuan University, together with Prof. Yu He from the Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, demonstrates that iron-carbon alloys shift into a superionic phase under the inner core's extreme conditions. In this environment, carbon atoms zip through the iron lattice at high speeds, greatly reducing the alloy's stiffness.

""For the first time, we've experimentally shown that iron-carbon alloy under inner core conditions exhibits a remarkedly low shear velocity."" said Prof. Zhang. ""In this state, carbon atoms become highly mobile, diffusing through the crystalline iron framework like children weaving through a square dance, while the iron itself remains solid and ordered. This so-called ""superionic phase"" dramatically reduces alloy's rigidity.""

Experimental Evidence Confirms Previous Predictions

Although computer simulations in 2022 suggested the inner core might take on this exotic form, confirming it in the laboratory had proven difficult -- until now. Using a dynamic shock compression platform, the researchers propelled iron-carbon samples to 7 kilometers per second, achieving pressures of up to 140 gigapascals and temperatures near 2600 kelvin, closely reproducing the environment found in the inner core.

By pairing in-situ sound velocity measurements with advanced molecular dynamics simulations, the team detected a dramatic loss of shear wave speed and a sharp increase in Poisson's ratio. These results align with the unexpectedly soft seismic characteristics recorded within Earth. On an atomic level, the data showed carbon atoms moving freely through iron's orderly structure, weakening it without causing the lattice to collapse.

A Superionic Core That Shapes Earth's Dynamics

The superionic model not only accounts for long-standing seismic anomalies but also expands our understanding of how the inner core contributes to Earth's internal processes. The motion of light elements may explain seismic anisotropy -- directional variations in seismic wave speeds -- and could also play a role in sustaining Earth's magnetic field.

""Atomic diffusion within the inner core represents a previously overlooked energy source for the geodynamo,"" said Dr. Huang. ""In addition to heat and compositional convection, the fluid-like motion of light elements may help power Earth's magnetic engine.""

The study also clarifies debates over the behavior of light elements under extreme pressure. Earlier research focused mainly on compounds or substitutional alloys, but this work highlights the key role of interstitial solid solutions (especially those involving carbon) in controlling the core's physical properties.

A Shift in How Scientists View Earth's Center

According to Prof. Zhang, these findings represent a major change in how scientists interpret the inner core. ""We're moving away from a static, rigid model of the inner core toward a dynamic one,"" he explained.

The implications extend beyond Earth. Identifying a superionic phase in the inner core could also improve our understanding of magnetic and thermal evolution in other rocky planets and exoplanets. As Zhang notes, ""Understanding this hidden state of matter brings us one step closer to unlocking the secrets of Earth-like planetary interiors.""

This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Sichuan Science and Technology Program, and the CAS Youth Interdisciplinary Team.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Human brains light up for chimp voices in a way no one expected","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251209043042.htm","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 06:47:41 GMT","

The human brain is not limited to recognizing our own voices. Research from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) has revealed that specific parts of the auditory cortex react strongly to chimpanzee vocalizations. Chimpanzees are our closest relatives both genetically and in the types of sounds they produce. The study, which appears in the journal eLife, indicates that certain subregions of the brain may be especially tuned to the calls of particular primate species. This insight offers a new way to explore how voice recognition emerged and how it may relate to the development of language.

Human voices play a central role in social communication, and a significant portion of the auditory cortex is devoted to interpreting them. Researchers wanted to know whether these abilities have deeper evolutionary origins. To investigate this question, scientists from UNIGE's Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences used a comparative approach grounded in species evolution. By examining how the human brain processes the vocalizations of closely related species, such as chimpanzees, bonobos and macaques, they aimed to identify traits shared with other primates. This approach helps shed light on how the neural foundations of vocal communication began to emerge long before language existed.

Studying How the Brain Responds to Primate Calls

In the experiment, 23 human volunteers listened to vocal sounds from four species. Human voices served as the control group. Chimpanzee calls were included because these primates are closely related to us both genetically and acoustically. Bonobo vocalizations were also tested, even though they often sound more like birdsong. Macaque calls were added because these primates are more distantly related to humans both evolutionarily and acoustically. Researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine activity across the auditory cortex. ""Our intention was to verify whether a subregion sensitive specifically to primate vocalizations existed,"" explains Leonardo Ceravolo, research associate at UNIGE's Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences and first author of the study.

A Distinct Neural Response to Chimpanzee Vocalizations

The results confirmed their expectations. A part of the auditory cortex known as the superior temporal gyrus, which plays a key role in processing sounds related to language, music and emotional cues, showed increased activation when participants heard certain primate calls. ""When participants heard chimpanzee vocalizations, this response was clearly distinct from that triggered by bonobos or macaques.""

This pattern is particularly striking because bonobos are just as genetically close to humans as chimpanzees, yet their vocalizations differ greatly in acoustic structure. The findings suggest that both evolutionary closeness and similarity in sound features influence how the human brain reacts.

What the Findings Suggest About Language Evolution

This discovery offers new directions for understanding how the neural basis of communication evolved. It indicates that some parts of the human brain may have preserved a sensitivity to the calls of our closest primate relatives. ""We already knew that certain areas of the animal brain reacted specifically to the voices of their fellow creatures. But here, we show that a region of the adult human brain, the anterior superior temporal gyrus, is also sensitive to non-human vocalizations,"" notes Leonardo Ceravolo.

These results support the idea that humans and great apes share vocal processing abilities that existed before spoken language emerged. They may also help explain how voice recognition develops in early life. For instance, this line of research could clarify how babies begin recognizing familiar voices while still in utero.

As immigration raids have swept the country, it's not just immigrants who have been kidnapped and detained. American citizens have also been caught up in the Trump administration's draconian policies.

Leonardo Garcia Venegas, a US citizen living in Alabama, was forcibly detained in May by immigration authorities while at a construction worksite. When confronted, Garcia Venegas told authorities that he was a citizen and showed them his Alabama REAL ID, his lawyers claim. But that didn't stop the authorities from tackling Garcia Venegas to the ground and putting him in handcuffs, they allege. In a court filing, Garcia Venegas says that he was kept handcuffed in the back of a car “in the hot Alabama sun” for over an hour.

Less than a month later, Garcia Venegas says, he was detained again at a worksite. While he wasn't handcuffed this time, immigration authorities ignored the fact that Garcia Venegas told them he was a citizen and again presented them with a REAL ID, his lawyers claim.

Garcia Venegas is now suing the government. In his court declaration, Garcia Venegas says that an officer told him his ID was “fake.”

“I think that if you fit the demographic profile that they're targeting and you are a citizen, [authorities] view the 30 minutes or three hours or three days that you spend in custody as just a necessary cost of the current enforcement system and the quotas and the bonuses and everything that goes along with that,” says Jared McClain, senior attorney at the Institute for Justice, which is representing Garcia Venegas.

“Allegations that DHS law enforcement officers engage in “racial profiling” are disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE. What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S.—NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity. Under the fourth amendment of the U.S. Constitution, DHS law enforcement uses “reasonable suspicion” to make arrests. There are no “indiscriminate stops” being made. The Supreme Court recently vindicated us on this question. DHS enforces federal immigration law without fear, favor, or prejudice,” assistant secretary for public affairs at DHS Tricia McLaughlin tells WIRED.

Cases like this one are unfortunately not unique. According to reporting from ProPublica, at least 170 US citizens have been detained by immigration authorities through the first nine months of 2025. And this could all get much worse: The US government is rapidly combining data across federal agencies that could put a lot more people, including US citizens, in the crosshairs of its harsh immigration policies.

WIRED first reported in April that the Trump administration had been pooling data from across the government in its push to surveil and track immigrants, and it's only continued from there.

Over the past few months, several federal agencies have issued system of records notices (SORNs), which are public notices that outline changes to how data collected by an agency will be used or shared. These SORNs are harbingers of what's to come: In October, a SORN issued by DHS officially transformed the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE), housed in US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The revised database will now include voter registration and verification. A few weeks later, WIRED reported, the Social Security Administration (SSA) issued a SORN that would officially allow the agency to share data with DHS for the purpose of immigration enforcement. Though this specific effort had been underway for months, the SORN makes the data sharing official and allows for public feedback. (The SSA SORN has already received more than 10,000 comments, including, “No, absolutely not. This is so dangerous.”)

Experts told WIRED the SSA's move was unprecedented, particularly because SORNs are supposed to be published before the government makes the change. Then, just before Thanksgiving, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a SORN agreeing to share ""citizenship and immigration status, location, and phone

numbers"" with DHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The SORN also says that CMS may also share ""Medicaid information or data shared with CMS by states.""

(A Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson tells WIRED, “Several federal laws authorize CMS to make certain information available to DHS. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, ‘any information in any records kept by any department or agency of the Government as to the identity and location of aliens in the United States shall be made available to' immigration authorities. The data-sharing agreement between CMS and DHS does not apply to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents.”)

“All these tools and databases, they weren't set up in the past year. This has been a long time coming. The immigrant rights community has been warning about this kind of stuff for a long time,” says Jennifer Ibañez Whitlock, senior policy counsel at the National Immigration Law Center.

As part of its crackdown on immigration, the Trump administration has sought to cut off various avenues of government support for immigrants. From housing benefits to food stamps to health care, the government has placed increasing restrictions on the type of support immigrants can access—which were already heavily restricted.

Combining data from different agencies providing benefits with the aim of ensuring immigrants aren't accessing them could lead to even further surveillance. With state voter data also part of the mix, “that can include party affiliation and voting history, so there's a concern that they might surveil people” based on their political affiliations, says Nikhel Sus, deputy chief counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. CREW is helping represent several plaintiffs, including naturalized citizens, that are suing the government, claiming it is unlawfully sharing sensitive data across agencies.

Among the concerns is that data is not easily isolated. When data are collected and tracked—say, to make sure someone is (or isn't) getting food aid—it's likely that other, related data, like immigration status, is going to be collected but may not be consistently updated. Data collected at the local or state level may also differ from data collected at the federal level, causing mismatching or other errors. “Whenever data is used for a purpose other than it was collected for, there can be mistakes in the data, or it may just not be up to date,” says Sus. Drawing on inaccurate data could mean that people who should be eligible for government benefits might be shut out or that eligible voters might be removed from the voter rolls.

McClain adds that even if the technology the government is using works well and the data are accurate, there is no longer a guarantee that authorities will abide by it. In a declaration filed as part of Garcia Venegas' suit, an immigrant says that although she showed officers paperwork confirming her legal right to work in the US and was subjected to what she believes was a facial recognition tool to confirm her identity, this was still not enough to keep her from being detained, zip-tied with ""shackles around [her] legs"" for several hours. “At first, they seemed satisfied,” the declaration reads. “But another officer (who appeared to be a supervisor) said that they could not trust my paperwork because ‘the Biden Administration made a lot of mistakes.'”

People particularly at risk for a data mishap or surveillance are naturalized citizens, according to Sus. That's because, for instance, when someone is issued a social security number for them to be allowed to legally live and work in the United States, that number remains the same, even if they eventually become a citizen. This means someone who is now a citizen might still be listed as an alien in SSA's database.

These issues have already come up. In a declaration filed by one of the naturalized citizens represented by CREW in their lawsuit against the government, a plaintiff wrote, “I applied to the Social Security Administration (SSA) and received a social security number (SSN) in or around 2001. At the time I applied for an SSN, I was a lawful permanent resident. Currently, my data stored with SSA, and therefore the information pooled by DHS in the SAVE system, does not correctly reflect my status as a U.S. citizen. SSA records instead (incorrectly) describe me as a non-citizen, as I was when I first interacted with SSA.”

There isn't a system to address these issues, either. “I'm not hearing any conversation from this administration about how somebody would go about ‘clearing' their social security number. How could they, for example, get a protective order against DHS coming to them once they've naturalized?” says Ibañez Whitlock.

The risks of getting the data wrong, though, may not just extend to things like government benefits or voting rights. “The rapid nature of this is you get put in the back of a van, you might be four states away in a couple of hours and put in a facility where the records aren't even updated online,” says McClain. “You're getting pushed through removal proceedings a week later before anybody has figured out where you are or has figured out how to put together the resources to help you.”

— T-Mobile appointed Jon Freier as its new chief operating officer. He succeeds Srini Gopalan, who was named CEO of the Bellevue, Wash., telecom giant in a surprise move that took effect last month. 

Freier joins the C-suite from his previous position as president of the T-Mobile Consumer Group, a title he has held since 2021. But he has been with the company for much longer: Freier began his professional career at Western Wireless in 1994 when he was 19 years old. That business became T-Mobile after Germany's Deutsche Telekom took over as majority shareholder in 2001. 

The company disclosed Freier's promotion in a filing. T-Mobile has undergone additional leadership reshuffling in recent months, expanding the role of its chief technologist and marking the departure of its chief communications and corporate responsibility officer and its business group president. 

— Alex Berezhnyy is now chief technology officer for RentSpree, a Seattle company that supports the rental application and screening process, and helps manage lease documents and payments.

Berezhnyy was previously at the real estate platform Redfin for more than a decade, leaving the role of vice president of engineering. Prior to that, he was at Amazon where he served in a variety of software development manager roles in retail systems and Kindle education.

“[Berezhnyy] brings deep technical expertise, a track record of building strong teams, and a bold vision for how AI will shape the future of renting,” RentSpree posted on LinkedIn. 

— Paige Johnson has left her role as Microsoft's vice president of Education. She is relaunching EdCatalyst Group, an Oregon-based consulting business that she previously ran for nearly three years that supports companies, nonprofits and public organizations in using AI to expand their impact.

“My years at Microsoft were an extraordinary chapter. I learned so much about how AI is reshaping industries — from education and media to public sector and financial services,” Johnson said on LinkedIn.

Earlier in her career, Johnson was with Intel for nearly two decades, creating and scaling a professional development program that trained millions of teachers worldwide.

— James Newell is chief financial officer of WayTrade, a commodity trading company focused on renewable fuels including sustainable aviation fuel. 

Newell, who will work remotely from Seattle, was previously a general partner with Voyager Capital, an investor in early stage companies in the Pacific Northwest.

“I found the perfect opportunity to make a meaningful impact at a company that itself makes a meaningful impact, and I get to do so alongside incredible people,” Newell said on LinkedIn. 

— After 15 years with Amazon Web Services, Julien Ellie has resigned from his job as senior principal engineer. Ellie praised his colleagues who helped shape cloud computing, but said the company he joined and what AWS has become are no longer the same.

“From where I sit, process has taken precedence over customers, and rules have replaced high judgment. The culture has shifted from high trust to low trust, and from impact-driven to ‘who you know.' That doesn't align with the builder mindset that brought me here,” Ellie said on LinkedIn.

Prior to Amazon, Ellie was at Microsoft for nearly a decade.

— Jonathan Assayag has left his Sunnyvale, Calif., role with Amazon where he served as general manager and director of the company's smart eyewear program. During more than nine years at the tech giant, Assayag worked on products including Echo Frames and Smart Delivery Glasses.

“These were true zero-to-one efforts that pushed ambient computing, Voice AI, and AI-assisted workflows into new territory. They challenged me both as a builder and a leader, sharpening how I think, make decisions, and drive impact,” he said on LinkedIn. 

Assayag also thanked his team members and company leaders. He did not share his next move. 

— Gravyty, a Seattle-based company that facilitates alumni donations and higher ed student engagement, named Lisa Haubenstock as its new chief customer officer. Haubenstock joins Gravyty from shipping logistics company Truckstop, and has held roles at Amazon and the education company Everfi.

“Gravyty presents an opportunity to tie together so much of my previous experience with a truly dedicated global team working to build something great,” Haubenstock said on LinkedIn.

— Bobby Franzo is now CEO of WatchMeGrow, a Lacey, Wash.-based company that provides cameras and live video streaming in the childcare, pet-care and senior-care spaces. He succeeds John Lewison, who led the company for 24 years and is now a board member and advisor. 

Franzo is the founder of PB&J TV (Peanut Butter and Jelly TV), a streaming service that merged with WatchMeGrow earlier this year. 

“What started as an idea to give families peace of mind has evolved into a company shaping how technology supports safety and quality during the most important years of a child's development,” Lewison said on LinkedIn. He added that Franzo “is exactly what the company needs at this moment, and I'm thrilled he's at the helm.”

— CreateMe, a California-based clothing manufacturer using robotic assembly lines, announced two leadership changes:

— Lauren Weinberg is now a board advisor at Adora, a Seattle-based marketing technology startup that emerged from stealth in October. Her past roles include leadership positions at Peleton Interactive, Square, Yahoo and elsewhere.

Amazon says it will allow authors to offer their DRM-free e-books in the EPUB and PDF formats through its self-publishing platform, Kindle Direct Publishing. Starting on January 20, 2026, authors who set their titles as DRM-free will see their books made available in these more open formats.

The decision to use Digital Rights Management (DRM), a copyright protection mechanism, is set by the authors when they publish their e-books on Amazon's platform.

The company notes these changes won't impact previously published titles. If authors want to change the status of older titles, they'll have to log into the Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) author portal and change an option in the settings. (Instructions on how to make that change are on Amazon's KDP support site.)

This move may actually incentivize authors to apply DRM to their e-books.

As one author on the KDP Community forums, Leslie Anne Perry, noted, “Previously, I have not enabled DRM on my e-books. My thinking was that I wanted folks to be able to download them to other devices within their own household. However, I think I will enable it on any future e-books. I'm not sure I want people to be able to download them as a PDFs [sic].”

Another member pushed back at the complaints, arguing that it doesn't really increase privacy, as those who had wanted to could always dump the existing DRM-free Kindle file into software to convert it into an EPUB or PDF.

Amazon is positioning the new feature as making it “easier” for readers to enjoy the content they've already purchased, but the reality is that authors would have to opt in if they want to open up access to their older works. To remove the DRM, authors will have to click a box that says, “I understand that by not applying DRM, customers who buy and have already bought this book will be able to download it as a PDF or EPUB file.”

Elsewhere, Amazon has been making it more difficult for Kindle owners to share or back up their e-books through heavier use of DRM in recent months.

With an update to Kindle's software for 11th- and 12th-generation devices, the retailer introduced a new DRM system that made it impossible for Kindle users to back up their e-books without jailbreaking their device. This had followed an earlier change to remove the download and transfer options via USB, which angered many Kindle owners.

After the author updates their e-book's DRM status, Amazon says the changes will take up to 72 hours before they are live on Amazon.com.

Adobe is doubling down on its strategy of using AI to bring more users into its product ecosystem. The company on Wednesday said it is adding features from Photoshop, Express, and Acrobat to ChatGPT, letting users ask the chatbot to use these apps to edit images, modify PDFs, or animate elements.

So users can now tell ChatGPT to use Photoshop to edit specific parts of images; remove or blur the background; adjust exposure, brightness, and contrast; or apply various effects. The chatbot will also give you an option to modify the intensity of effects using sliders. 

With support for Express, ChatGPT now lets users tell it to do stuff like fetch existing designs from its library, put together themed creatives, animate elements, and edit designs.

And with Acrobat's PDF editing capabilities, ChatGPT can do things like merge files, edit or extract text or tables within a file, and more.

If at any point you don't feel like struggling with ChatGPT, you get an option to continue working inside Adobe's apps to finish the job yourself or use features that are not available within ChatGPT.

Adobe said these features will be available globally. While features from all three Adobe apps are available on ChatGPT's desktop, web, and iOS apps, only Adobe Express is currently supported on ChatGPT for Android. The company says support for Photoshop and Express is coming soon.

Adobe has shipped many AI-powered features and products this year. In October, the company released AI assistants for Express and Photoshop, and also teased a cross-app assistant, dubbed Project Moonlight.

OpenAI started supporting third-party apps inside ChatGPT in October, launching with Canva, Spotify, Expedia, and Figma. But as more companies work to bake in their apps within the popular chatbot, the challenge for companies will be getting people to use their app instead of a rival's inside ChatGPT. For instance, you can use both Canva and Photoshop to edit images with the chatbot, but if you don't use either of these apps, you might not have a preference.

Google is testing AI-powered article overviews on participating publications' Google News pages as part of a new pilot program, the search giant announced on Wednesday. 

News publishers participating in the pilot program include Der Spiegel, El País, Folha, Infobae, Kompas, The Guardian, The Times of India, The Washington Examiner, and The Washington Post, among others.

The purpose of the new commercial partnership program is to “explore how AI can drive more engaged audiences,” Google said in a blog post. As part of the new AI pilot program, the company will work with publishers to experiment with new features in Google News.

By adding AI-powered article overviews, Google says users will get more context before they click through to read an article. While AI-generated summaries may lead to fewer clicks on news articles, publications participating in the commercial pilot program will receive direct payments from Google, which could make up for the potential decrease in traffic to their sites. 

The AI-powered article overviews will only appear on participating publications' Google News pages, and not anywhere else on Google News or in Search.

This isn't the first time that Google has introduced AI summaries for news. In July, the company rolled out AI summaries in Discover, the main news feed inside Google's search app. With this change, users no longer see a single headline from a major publication in the feed. Instead, they see the logos of multiple news publishers in the top-left corner, followed by an AI-generated summary that cites those sources.

Google is also experimenting with audio briefings for people who prefer listening to the news rather than reading it, as part of the new pilot program. 

The company says these features will include clear attribution and a link to articles.

Additionally, Google is partnering with organizations such as Estadão, Antara, Yonhap, and The Associated Press to incorporate real-time information and enhance results in the Gemini app. 

“As the way people consume information evolves, we'll continue to improve our products for people around the world and engage with feedback from stakeholders across the ecosystem,” Google wrote in its blog post. “We're doing this work in collaboration with websites and creators of all sizes, from major news publishers to new and emerging voices.”

As part of Google's Wednesday announcement, the company said that it's launching its “Preferred Sources” feature globally after first launching it in the U.S. and India in August. The feature allows users to select their favorite news sites and blogs to appear in the Top Stories section of Google search results.

In the coming days, the feature will be available for English-language users worldwide, and Google plans to roll it out to all supported languages early next year.

Google will now also highlight links from your news subscriptions and show these links in a dedicated carousel in the Gemini app in the coming weeks, with AI Overviews and AI Mode to follow.

While these features make it easy for users to access news from their preferred sources, they also risk confining them to an ideological bubble that limits their exposure to different perspectives.

Google also announced that it's increasing the number of inline links in AI Mode. Additionally, it's introducing “contextual introductions” for embedded links, which are brief explanations that explain why a link could be useful to explore.

The model has a certain capacity -- quite limited in this case -- so there is an opportunity cost in learning one thing over another. That's why it is important to train on quality data; things you can build on top of.

Especially in the fruit pricing portion of the video for this model. Sounds completely normal but I can immediately tell it is ai. Maybe it's intonation or the overly stable rate of speech?

                Reading time 4 minutes
      

Scammers love to seed the internet with fake customer service numbers in order to lure in unsuspecting victims who are just trying to fix something wrong in their life. Con artists have done it to Google Search for years, so it makes sense that they've moved on to the latest space where people are frequently searching for information: AI chatbots.

AI cybersecurity company Aurascape has a new report on how scammers are able to inject their own phone numbers into LLM-powered systems—resulting in scam numbers appearing as authoritative-sounding answers to requests for contact information in AI applications like Perplexity or Google AI Overviews. And when someone calls that number, they're not talking with customer support from, say, Apple. They're talking with the scammers.

According to Aurascape, the scammers are able to do this through a wide variety of different tactics. One way is by planting spam content on trusted websites, like government, university and high-profile sites that use WordPress. This method requires gaining access in ways that may be more difficult but aren't impossible.

The easier version of this is planting the spam content on user-generated platforms like YouTube and Yelp or other sites that allow reviews. The scammers inject their phone numbers but include all of the likely search terms that would allow the number to find their intended target, such as “Delta Airlines customer support number” and countless variations.

All of that is normal for scammers trying to juice Google Search results. But Aurascape notes it's the structure of the data that can set it apart for LLMs. By posting the likely search terms in the summarization formats that AI loves to deliver, it has a higher chance of success as these AI chatbots scour the internet for an answer.

The new report refers to Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) and Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) as distinct from SEO, coaxing the AI to retrieve the content and treat it as authoritative because of the way it's being presented. To be clear, the scam outputs in the Aurascape report are simply being retrieved and reproduced in the context of an individual AI output, not corrupting the LLM itself.

“For traditional SEO, the goal is to appear high in a list of search results,” the company explains. “For GEO/AEO, the goal is more direct: be the single piece of content that the AI assistant chooses, summarizes, and presents as ‘the answer.'”

As detailed in the report, the scammers utilize GEO/AEO techniques in html and PDFs uploaded to high-trust sites by:

That Emirates reservation number is one of the many examples Aurascape uses in the report to show how Perplexity delivered a scam phone number during tests. Google's AI Overviews feature also delivered fake numbers.

Gizmodo did some quick testing and wasn't able to duplicate a fake customer support number. But it seems pretty clear that AI companies are starting to take notice, especially given the specific tests conducted for this Aurascape report.

When Gizmodo asked Perplexity for the customer support number for Emirates Airlines, the bot responded:

The safest way to reach Emirates for reservations is to use the official contact channels listed on the Emirates website rather than third‑party numbers that appear in search results or PDFs, which are often spam or agency lines misrepresented as “official.”

Gizmodo pressed for the bot to just give us the number, but it responded:

There are multiple conflicting “Emirates reservations” numbers online, and many of them are actually third‑party agencies rather than Emirates itself, so none of the +1‑(8xx) numbers shown on generic guides can be trusted as an official line.

The bot told us to visit emirates.com to find the number. And we guess that is one way to fight back against your AI chatbot spreading misinformation and spam. Just stop it from spreading specific types of information altogether.

Back in 2022, we wrote about the different scam websites that were successfully getting victims to download what they thought were Canon printer drivers. While the new report from Aurascape didn't address downloadable drivers as a potential attack vector, we can imagine that would be something scammers are already trying.

After all, AI chatbots should only be trusted when they show their work. But the flip side of that is the necessity of the chatbot providing hyperlinks where information can be double checked. Or, in this hypothetical, where software could be downloaded. Just make sure you scrutinize that URL carefully. There's a big difference between usa.canon.com and canon.com-ijsetup.com. The latter is a phishing website.

“Our investigation shows that threat actors are already exploiting this frontier at scale—seeding poisoned content across compromised government and university sites, abusing user-generated platforms like YouTube and Yelp, and crafting GEO/AEO-optimized spam designed specifically to influence how large language models retrieve, rank, and summarize information,” Aurascape wrote.

“The result is a new class of fraud in which AI systems themselves become unintentional amplifiers of scam phone numbers. Even when models provide correct answers, their citations and retrieval layers often reveal exposure to polluted sources. This tells us the problem is not isolated to a single model or single vendor—it is becoming systemic.”

Earlier this week, Dell was wrongly flagged for charging even more than Apple for memory upgrades in their laptops, which later turned out to be a misinformed call; nevertheless, Framework was quick to pounce on the opportunity and call out fellow vendors, while warning its own RAM price hikes to follow soon.

We are going to need to increase our memory pricing soon, but we won't use this as an excuse to gouge customers like @Dell apparently has and that @Apple does as their norm.December 9, 2025

The story begins with YouTuber Max Tech, aka Vadim Yuryev, who took to X in a now-deleted post to express his disappointment with laptop memory prices. In particular, he posted a screenshot from Dell's website, showing a Snapdragon X Plus-equipped XPS 13 with 16 GB of RAM. The issue? Going from 16 GB to 32 GB apparently cost a whopping $550... at least in the screenshot.

In reality, the upgrade's worth just $150 on Dell's site right now, at least on the laptop Yuryev's original tweet referenced. For context, Apple has charged $400 for the same 16 GB upgrade for years, way before any DRAM shortage, so people were rightfully shocked. However, as mentioned, this screenshot was either actually altered or, more likely, showed a $550 price hike because memory wasn't the only thing being upgraded.

See, Dell's laptop configurator works in a confusing manner where selecting certain options triggers others to automatically change, too. For instance, the jump from 16 GB to 32 GB RAM may have come with a jump in SSD capacity as well, or even a higher spec'd CPU, but since these changes happened silently in the background, they look like standalone charges for the RAM alone.

 




As you can see in our screenshot above, when you select the 32 GB RAM option, it prompts you to confirm the change since the CPU will be upgraded alongside it — from a Snapdragon X Plus to X Elite, so the total cost of the upgrade is $300, but Dell is offering a $150 discount on that. Try playing around with the configurator yourself to discover just how much of a maze it is, though you can still tell what's changing. A pricing error or perhaps a currency/region issue in the original screenshot also can't be ruled out, but one thing is certain: Dell definitely isn't charging $550 for 32GB of RAM. At least not yet anyway.

The OP must've realized his oversight after replies and media coverage pointed it out, at which point he deleted the original post. Unfortunately, Framework already replied with a scathing post, letting users know that it'll need to raise memory prices soon as well, but that it won't overcharge customers like ""apparently"" Dell and Apple. A point made based on erroneous information, but perhaps deserved nonetheless.

Our upgrade from 16GB to 32GB of RAM is… $80. https://t.co/0MPUfQxx0W pic.twitter.com/VSTY6lkSF8December 9, 2025

Framework's tweet remains up, but the post above it from Vadim is gone. However, Framework's point that its memory upgrades are more affordable than rival laptop makers (for now) still stands. Moving forward, that will change. ""We are going to need to increase our memory pricing soon,"" Framework warned in a follow-up. ""But we won't use this as an excuse to gouge customers like Dell apparently has, and that Apple does as their norm,"" the company added. Only time will tell when Framework will increase its prices and by how much. A few weeks ago, the company stopped selling standalone RAM in order to stop the supply from being consumed by scalpers.

Put any persistent window or widget you can think of right on your case, no DIY required.

Well-designed PC cases with good airflow are mostly a solved problem these days, so builders who want their setups to stand out need to get creative. Corsair is giving tinkerers a fresh canvas to play with by offering its highly modular Frame 4000D LCD RS ARGB case with its Xeneon Edge wide-screen touch display built in.

We reviewed the Corsair Frame 4000D a while back and found it an excellent case for the money, praising its thermals and airflow options. At the time, we dinged it for the dearth of promised modular upgrades, but Corsair is taking a step towards fixing that today by mounting a Xeneon Edge beneath the case's main chamber.

The Edge's 2560x720 AHVA display is a nifty piece of kit that works as a standard monitor as far as Windows is concerned, so you can put basically any window on it you can imagine. It can be used for component monitoring, general information display, or for general utility shortcuts. It integrates with Corsair's iCUE software and is easily customizable.

The Xeneon Edge also has five-point touch functionality, it's not hard to imagine potential multi-tap gesture functionality, like swiping your fingers past it in one direction or another to change your system's power profile, fan settings, and RGB lighting all at once, like putting a car into sport mode. Or, hey, maybe slap a graph of DDR5 RAM prices on there so you can feel smug about what you've already got.

Indeed, there's already a SimHub plugin that some gamers are already making excellent use of, as well as a Spotify controller widget. We could also see the Xeneon Edge hosting live stream statistics or featured chat messages on a stream PC. Do you strictly need a screen on your case for those things? No, but as with so many other parts of PC building and customization, it would sure look cool.

If you're interested in this setup for your own build, Corsair is asking $399.99 for the case-and-display set, which it's calling the Frame 4000D LCD RS ARGB. That might sound steep, but that variation of the Frame 4000D is $109.99 to start with. Add the corresponding mounting kit for $39.99 and the Xeneon Edge itself at $249.99, and the grand total comes in at basically the same amount as the separate parts, minus the hassle of putting it all together yourself.

The Frame 4000D LCD RS ARGB setup comes in black and white to fit the most common color-coordinated setups nowadays. If you have the larger Frame 5000D Airflow case and want to add a Xeneon Edge to your existing setup, the mounting kit to attach the display to your case is $49.99 on its own.

Washington reopens path for Nvidia's H200 after yearlong ban


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The U.S. government has formally approved the export of Nvidia's high-performance H200 AI chips to China, reinstating access to a class of silicon previously barred under national security rules. Sales will be allowed to select Chinese customers pending government review, and each chip must be routed through U.S. territory for inspection and accompanied by a 25% import duty. The move ends a freeze that ultimately led to Nvidia losing its entire Chinese market share and upended development plans for large-scale AI models in the region.

The announcement, first made by President Donald Trump via Truth Social, comes after months of internal debate within the U.S. administration over how to apply export restrictions without accelerating China's ability to develop domestic alternatives. The H200, a powerful GPU from Nvidia's Hopper generation, significantly outperforms the previously approved H20 and had been considered too capable for Chinese markets under earlier rules. Its reauthorization hints that there's been a shift in Washington's approach, namely to maintain technological superiority, but it will allow controlled access to limit the pace of Chinese self-sufficiency.

 




The decision to allow H200 exports follows concerns that sweeping restrictions were producing unintended results. Since the initial wave of AI chip bans in 2022, Chinese firms have intensified development of homegrown accelerators, with Huawei's Ascend 910C making significant progress in training and inference workloads. While still behind Nvidia in absolute performance, Huawei's architecture is increasingly seen as serviceable for national and commercial deployments, especially as its fabrication partners improve yields.

Internal discussions in Washington, as reported by multiple sources, shifted focus from outright denial to managed access. Officials seem to have eventually concluded that permitting H200 sales — while keeping newer architectures like Blackwell and the upcoming Rubin out of reach — could slow China's push for chip independence without giving away the U.S. lead in performance. The H200 remains one generation behind Nvidia's cutting-edge designs but is fully capable of training modern foundation models and large-scale AI systems.

This repositioning allows U.S. regulators to reassert some control over China's access to advanced silicon while capturing financial and political value from every sale. Under the terms of the new export framework, each H200 must be manufactured by TSMC, shipped to the U.S. for inspection, and then re-exported to China. The 25% duty is collected at the U.S. checkpoint, with the funds directed to federal revenue.

Chinese regulators have not publicly responded to the U.S. announcement but are said to have begun internal reviews. According to reporting by The Information, officials from the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology have held meetings with Alibaba, ByteDance, and Tencent to assess their projected demand for H200 GPUs. The companies have been asked to provide use cases and expected unit volumes, with the understanding that the government may impose caps or usage guidelines.

Two sources present at those meetings told The Information that regulators are considering import limits tied to domestic procurement. Companies may be required to demonstrate that they are also investing in Chinese accelerators such as Huawei's Ascend or Cambricon's Siyuan series. This model, used previously to guide purchases of data center components and server platforms, allows Beijing to balance near-term hardware needs with its goal of reducing reliance on U.S. suppliers.

China has also continued to apply informal pressure to shift buyers toward domestic chips. In August, Chinese regulators issued guidance to steer state-backed entities and infrastructure projects away from Nvidia's H20, resulting in widespread cancellations of contracts. The H200 presents a different scenario, given its substantial performance advantage, but officials are expected to apply similar discretion in determining which sectors and use cases are eligible.

SuperCloud, a domestic cloud services provider, confirmed that it expects major Chinese companies to proceed with H200 purchases if permitted, though in a subdued fashion. “The training of leading Chinese AI models still relies on Nvidia cards,” said Zhang Yuchun, a general manager at SuperCloud, when speaking to Reuters. “I expect the leading Chinese tech companies to buy a lot although in a low key manner.”

 




Nvidia's ability to meet demand in China will likely be constrained by supply. The company has kept H200 output relatively low as it focused on ramping production of its Blackwell-class B100 and B200 GPUs, as well as preparing for its Rubin successor. Also speaking to Reuters, two sources familiar with Nvidia's supply chain said that H200 manufacturing has been deprioritized in favor of fulfilling high-margin orders from U.S. hyperscalers and sovereign AI programs in allied countries.

Chinese firms looking to place orders may therefore find themselves at the back of the queue. Alibaba and ByteDance are both thought to be “keen to place large orders” should Chinese regulators give them the green light to do so. However, the companies are concerned about supply and are said to be actively seeking clarity from Nvidia on this.

If all this goes ahead, the H200 would reintroduce training-scale compute capacity to Chinese AI developers after a long period of reliance on repurposed hardware and grey-market acquisitions. The chip delivers roughly six times the performance of the H20 and approaches the capabilities of Nvidia's H100, which has been banned from China since late 2022. Unlike most Chinese accelerators, the H200 supports Nvidia's CUDA software ecosystem, simplifying model porting and cluster integration.

Ultimately, Nvidia is unlikely to resume large-scale H200 production unless it receives strong approval from both U.S. and Chinese regulators, and equally strong demand from Chinese customers. The chip is already considered a transitional product within Nvidia's roadmap, with Blackwell occupying the top end of the current generation and Rubin expected to extend that lead in 2026.

U.S. officials have attached a number of technical and procedural conditions to the H200 export approval. Each unit must be shipped to the U.S. before entering China, creating a traceable logistics trail that allows U.S. Customs and Commerce Department inspectors to verify compliance. Nvidia has also introduced optional location-verification software that can confirm whether a chip is operating in an authorized geography.

The system uses a combination of secure telemetry and latency-based network checks to determine the approximate location of a GPU within a customer's infrastructure. While not mandatory — at least not yet — the feature has been privately demonstrated as a tool for audit and compliance. Nvidia has framed the technology as a data center management solution rather than a surveillance system, and the company has emphasized that it cannot remotely deactivate or control chips in the field.

Nonetheless, the software has raised concerns in Beijing, with the Cyberspace Administration of China questioning whether the technology constitutes a backdoor or allows external access to sensitive operations. Nvidia has stated that the system, which will first be made available on Blackwell chips, cannot be used for eavesdropping and does not transmit any user data to third parties. It remains to be seen whether Chinese buyers will enable the feature or attempt to route around it using intermediaries.

 




The compliance measures reflect a broader concern that export controls, while useful on paper, have proven difficult to enforce. We've seen several examples of banned Nvidia GPUs like the A100 and H100 appearing in the likes of Chinese university research and start-up product documentation since their respective bans. Many of these were likely acquired through grey-market channels or indirect resellers in third countries.

The U.S. Justice Department has already indicted several individuals involved in smuggling high-performance Nvidia chips to China in violation of export rules. Cases are ongoing in multiple districts, and officials have signaled that enforcement will intensify as more tracking capabilities become available.

The approval of H200 exports arguably represents a concession rather than any long-term structural change in U.S. policy. The Biden and Trump administrations have consistently maintained that the U.S. must retain leadership in AI hardware and semiconductor manufacturing. The H200, while advanced, is no longer Nvidia's leading product, and allowing access to it gives Washington a tool to slow China's push for independence without giving up the top tier of its technology stack.

From Beijing's perspective, the decision provides short-term relief. AI developers can resume training at scale using supported hardware and familiar toolchains, but the long-term imperative remains unchanged. China continues to invest in domestic foundries, chip design houses, and packaging capacity. Huawei is expanding its Ascend production targets, and other firms are attempting to design new architectures that bypass the limitations of restricted U.S. IP.

The H200 will be welcomed by those who can access it, but the approval comes with strings attached and no guarantee of duration. Chinese firms must navigate what could be a complex approvals process, limited supply, and reputational risk. Nvidia, meanwhile, must manage Washington's expectations while preventing its technology from slipping beyond authorized use.

The success or failure of this arrangement may determine how future export rules are written. If H200 exports proceed smoothly, it could serve as a model for calibrated engagement, but if compliance breaks down or political conditions shift, the window may close just as quickly as it opened.

Individuals who had overweight during childhood had an increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) during adulthood, but early weight normalisation before young adulthood could reverse this risk. Those who developed overweight during puberty carried an even higher long-term risk for CHD during adulthood than those who had persistent overweight from childhood.

""Public health efforts aiming to prevent CHD in adults should include preventive measures in early life, as well as early treatment of childhood and pubertal overweight,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Claes Ohlsson, PhD, Centre for Bone and Arthritis Research, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden. It was published online on December 01, 2025, in JAMA Pediatrics.

The cohort was predominantly White, potentially limiting generalisability. Adjustments for confounding factors were eliminated. Severe obesity was rare in this cohort; hence, the ability to estimate risks for this group was limited.

This study was supported by grants from the Swedish Research Council, the Heart-Lung Foundation, the Swedish state under the ALF-agreement, and others. Two authors reported receiving grants from the Swedish Research Council and other sources.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hey, everyone. Dr Chandrasekaran here. Today we're going to talk about the flu. It is flu season, and it is a time of year again to remember to wash your hands, wear a mask if you're going to be around a large number of people with a large amount of respiratory droplets, and take that flu vaccine. 

The flu vaccine is given annually and is mainly used to prevent influenza strains A and B. There are three major strains: A, B, and C; however, A and B are the most contagious and the ones that we do worry about. 

It's also important to remember to wash your hands and stay away from people who may be sick. The flu is very contagious and can be passed on quickly. 

Usually, symptoms occur 4 to 5 days after exposure or infection with the respiratory virus. Symptoms can include fevers up to 103 °F, body aches, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and fatigue. Tamiflu can be an option for treatment, along with other antivirals. 

If somebody is immunocompromised and does get the flu, they are at higher risk for pneumonia, pneumonitis, bronchitis, and other various types of respiratory illnesses.

Pneumonia can be prevented by the flu vaccine, and that is one of the most important reasons that we do prescribe and encourage immunocompromised patients to get the flu vaccine.

A new study in the Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior (JNEB), published by Elsevier, evaluated a 12-week home-delivered food and education program among adults in Northwest Arkansas. Participants received diabetes-appropriate grocery boxes along with diabetes self-management education materials in English, Spanish, or Marshallese. The intervention was designed and implemented by researchers at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Institute for Community Health Innovation (ICHI) using a community-engaged approach.

After the program, participants' average hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a key marker of blood sugar control, decreased by 0.56 percentage points, a clinically meaningful improvement that lowers the risk of diabetes-related complications. While diet quality did not show significant change, researchers note that providing culturally relevant, in-language educational materials and removing transportation barriers ensured that 97% of participants received the full intended intervention dose.

This study demonstrates the potential for home-delivered, medically tailored groceries to make measurable improvements in diabetes management for people experiencing food insecurity and facing transportation barriers. For many people with type 2 diabetes, reliable access to healthy food is not just a convenience-it's essential healthcare.""

Eliza Short, PhD, RDN, Lead Author, Research Scientist, Center for Nutrition & Health Impact and Research Collaborator with UAMS ICHI

The findings contribute to the growing field of Food Is Medicine (FIM) interventions, which connect nutrition access directly to chronic disease prevention and management. The authors emphasize that future research should explore which elements of such programs-food delivery, nutrition education, or both-most influence health outcomes. They also encourage tailoring food and education materials to reflect cultural food preferences across diverse communities to improve engagement and impact.

Airbnb hosts, meanwhile, are expected to rake in about $1,900 on average, according to a new report.

Airbnb expects to host 17,000 guests at its short-term rentals across the Philadelphia region when the FIFA World Cup comes to town next summer.

That's according to a new report, which was done by Deloitte at Airbnb's behest and released last week. Airbnb guests are expected to spend about $52 million on average during their stays in the Philly region, and about $14 million of that total will be spent on the rentals. 

Over the course of the six matches in June and July, Airbnb hosts are expected to rake in about $1,900 on average, totaling about $8 million in earnings for all area hosts, according to the report.

Officials from Philadelphia Soccer 2026 have estimated that the World Cup will bring 500,000 visitors to the region. Airbnb's report estimates that 149,000 of them will require overnight accommodations. 

Each Airbnb guest is expected to spend about $109 a night on average on the rentals, as well as another $301 a night on food, entertainment, and other expenses, according to the company's report.

Airbnb guests will have a total impact of about $167 million, including direct and indirect spending, the report projected, and that activity is expected to spur additional spending in the city over the following five years.

Some experts, however, caution that the long-term economic impacts of one-off sporting events tend to be overestimated, saying they usually lead to only temporary boosts to local economies.

Fans can enter a lottery to purchase tickets, which will be subject to dynamic pricing that fluctuates depending on demand. 

After the games were announced, some people went online to secure their short-term rentals. All host cities saw a 33% spike in new bookings last weekend, according to AirDNA, a site that analyzes data on short-term rentals. In Philadelphia, occupancy across all game days has reached 20%, a year and a half ahead of the event.

The World Cup will coincide with Philadelphia's celebration of the United States' 250th birthday. 

Airbnb has more than 8,300 listings in the Greater Philadelphia region, which brings in $29.4 million in annual revenue, according to AirDNA.

In 2023, Airbnbs in the city became more strictly regulated, with hosts now required to have permits and licensing. ","{'href': 'https://www.inquirer.com', 'title': 'Inquirer.com'}","soccer"

The 2026 FIFA World Cup will unfold at 16 stadiums across the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Five stadiums are home to Major League Soccer clubs, and 78 of the 104 games will occur in the United States.

Atlanta United's home stadium frequently welcomes some of MLS's largest crowds.

A club-record 73,019 fans attended Atlanta's 2018 MLS Cup triumph over the Portland Timbers, which is the third-largest single-game attendance in league history.

The New England Revolution have called Gillette Stadium home since the venue opened its doors in 2002.

The Revs broke their home attendance record in 2024 by welcoming 65,612 fans for a league match against Inter Miami CF.

Known primarily as the home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys, AT&T Stadium has hosted several editions of the Concacaf Gold Cup and the Concacaf Nations League.

The nearly 100,000-capacity arena will host nine World Cup matches, the most of any venue.

NRG Stadium has hosted numerous high-profile soccer events, including World Cup qualifiers, the 2016 Copa América Centenario, Leagues Cup and the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup final.

NRG Stadium was also the site of the 2010 MLS All-Star Game.

Arrowhead Stadium was the original home of Sporting Kansas City for their inaugural 1996 season.

It last hosted an MLS game in 2024, with 72,610 fans attending SKC vs. Inter Miami – the fourth-largest standalone crowd in MLS history.

SoFi Stadium has hosted the 2025 Concacaf Nations League Finals, Concacaf Gold Cup games and the 2022 Leagues Cup showcase, featuring the LA Galaxy and LAFC.

The home of the NFL's Miami Dolphins has witnessed some of Lionel Messi's most important career highlights in recent years.

The legendary No. 10 won the 2024 Copa América final with Argentina at Hard Rock Stadium, which also hosted two Inter Miami games during their historic run to the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup knockout stages.

MetLife Stadium will host the FIFA 2026 World Cup final on July 19.

The NFL venue routinely welcomes massive crowds for friendlies, both at club and international levels, and was the site of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup final.

Home to two-time Super Bowl winners Philadelphia Eagles, Lincoln Financial Field will host six games throughout the World Cup.

It routinely features high-profile soccer matches, and was the site of the Philadelphia Union's home opener during their inaugural 2010 MLS season.

The NFL-sized venue occasionally hosts home games for the San Jose Earthquakes.

In 2025, the Earthquakes broke their  for a Sept. 13 clash against California rivals LAFC.

As the home of Seattle Sounders FC, Lumen Field has been the site of some of MLS's most defining moments.

Highlights include the Sounders' 2019 MLS Cup win in front of 69,274 fans and their historic 2022 Concacaf Champions Cup title-clinching win over LIGA MX's Pumas UNAM, with an attendance of 68,741.

For the Leagues Cup 2025 final, the Sounders set a club and tournament attendance record of 69,314 fans during a 3-0 win over Inter Miami.

Seattle is ready.️⚽️@LumenField will play host to 6 matches, including a @USMNT group stage match, during the 2026 @FIFAWorldCup! pic.twitter.com/Z0EdOGz8FW

BMO Field has hosted Toronto FC home matches since their inaugural 2007 season and is first Canadian soccer-specific stadium for MLS.

The lakeside stadium will also host Canada's 2026 World Cup group stage opener on June 12.

Vancouver Whitecaps FC's ground will also serve as a home base of sorts for the CanMNT, who'll play their final two World Cup group stage matches (June 18 & 24) there.

Should Canada win Group B, they'd play the Round of 32 and, in the case of advancing, the Round of 16 at BC Place.

The legendary Estadio Azteca will become the first venue ever to host games in three different World Cups, following the 1970 and 1986 editions of the tournament.

In 2026, the first game of the competition will take place at the ""The Colossus of Santa Úrsula"" as Mexico kick off their World Cup campaign on June 11.

Four group stage games will take place at Estadio Akron, the home of traditional LIGA MX powerhouse Chivas de Guadajalara.

Boasting arguably the most stunning background scenery of any World Cup venue, Estadio BBVA is the only Mexican stadium that won't host any of El Tri's group-stage matches.","{'href': 'https://www.mlssoccer.com', 'title': 'MLSsoccer.com'}","soccer"

Our expert offers his best Real Madrid vs Man City Predictions, Lineups, Odds & Tips for this Champions League encounter at the Santiago Bernabeu today (10/12/2025)

Our betting expert expects the visitors to claim all the points. Phil Foden's good run of form in front of goal is expected to continue.

Odds courtesy of bet365, correct at time of publication and subject to change

Man City were impressive 3-0 winners at the weekend over Sunderland. While they've been heavily dependent on Erling Haaland for goals this term, more players are now starting to contribute. 

Rayan Cherki stole the show on Saturday with two assists. Haaland has only scored one of the last 14 City goals in all competitions. That certainly bodes well as Guardiola aims to build another great team.

By contrast, Real Madrid are still heavily reliant on Kylian Mbappe for attacking inspiration. In their last four matches, the Frenchman has either scored or assisted all eight of Real Madrid's goals. 

Alonso came with dreams of constructing a brilliant team, but there is no clear playing style emerging. There are defensive flaws too, with at least 1.0 xG allowed in six of their last seven games. That suggests Man City offer value here, with no clear favourite for this clash.

With Haaland suffering a slight dip in form, bettors may want to look elsewhere in the anytime goalscorer market. Foden stands out in a game that will be billed as a showdown between two of the great strikers of this era.

Like many of his teammates, the English midfielder endured a difficult 2024/25 season. However, Foden seems to be back to his best now, with five goals in his last three appearances. He has scored nine times in 19 outings in all competitions for his club this term.

Foden averages 0.52 goals per 90 minutes in the Premier League. That figure rises to 0.57 in Europe. He has also scored twice previously against Real Madrid, including a quarter-final strike at the Bernabeu in 2024.

Based on current form, Foden is good value to score anytime with an implied probability of 35.7%.

Real Madrid's defensive selection issues further suggest City could come out on top. The hosts suffered a huge setback on Sunday, with Eder Militao limping off against Celta Vigo. The Brazilian has been their most convincing centre-back this term, but he is now out until March.

Full-backs Dani Carvajal, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ferland Mendy are also out injured. David Alaba and Dean Huijsen are additional doubts heading into this fixture. That could leave the hosts without as many as six defenders on Wednesday night.

It was a similar scenario when they travelled to take on Olympiacos in their last Champions League match. They left too much space on that occasion and conceded three goals. However, four strikes from Mbappe still secured the win. Madrid also allowed 2.3 xG. They could have lost by more than 1-0 when they faced Liverpool earlier last month.

Man City have scored three or more goals in seven of their last nine matches in all competitions. They could be worth backing to score over 1.5 goals with an implied probability of 54.1%.

Real Madrid suffered a shock 2-0 defeat at home to Celta Vigo in La Liga on Sunday. That result has added to the growing uncertainty over Xabi Alonso's future at the club. With talk of a possible split in the squad, Los Blancos have won just two of their last seven competitive games.

Manchester City have won three on the bounce heading into this clash, facing rivals competing for a top-eight finish. However, they did lose their last Champions League match 2-0 at home to Bayer Leverkusen. After winning three of their opening five European fixtures, Pep Guardiola's side are currently on 10 points.

Real Madrid expected lineup: Courtois, Carreras, Asencio, Rudiger, Valverde, Tchouameni, Guler, Bellingham, Ceballos, Vinicius, Mbappe

Manchester City expected lineup: Donnarumma, Nunes, Dias, Gvardiol, O'Reilly, Gonzalez, Cherki, Reijnders, Foden, Doku, Haaland","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","'Now he knows who we are'","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/charles-de-ketelaere-roasts-alejandro-garnacho-pre-match-dig-atalanta-chelsea-shock-champions-league-defeat/blt0761d8447899471a","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 11:26:14 GMT","

Charles De Ketelaere enjoyed getting his revenge on Alejandro Garnacho as the Chelsea winger was made to eat his words after his side's Champions League defeat in Italy on Tuesday night. The Argentina international had ruffled some feathers while speaking during a pre-match press conference, but was left speechless after the Serie A side came from behind to claim a 2-1 victory.

Everything was going swimmingly for Chelsea when they went 1-0 up on Tuesday night thanks to Joao Pedro's 25th-minute strike. The Blues looked well on course to follow up their impressive thrashing of Barcelona last time out in the competition with another victory, but a limp second-half performance resulted in goals from Gianluca Scamacca and De Ketelaere, handing manager Enzo Maresca a defeat on his return to his homeland. They now sit 11th in the league phase table but will likely drop lower with a whole slate of fixtures set to be played on Wednesday.

Garnacho had been criticised by sections of the Italian media after admitting he had not watched much of Atalanta of late, stating: ""The last time I saw Atalanta was two years ago, in the Europa League final they won.""

That game was a historic one for Atalanta as they won just their second ever piece of major silverware, having previously lifted the Coppa Italia trophy all the way back in 1963.

In his defence, the former Manchester United winger did also say: ""Obviously, every game is important. We know when we play away it's a little bit harder, but in the Champions League every team can beat you. 

""It's a big opportunity for us to get the three points and I think we're going to be there in the top. We are focused on the game, like every game, and just to win. 

""We expect a strong team and a difficult match. We play away, they have their fans, so it's not going to be easy, but we have come here and we will try to do our work to get the three points and take them home.""

Garnacho wasn't included in the starting XI, instead being introduced from the bench in the 67th minute as the visiting side chased a winner shortly after Scamacca's equaliser.

Having clearly heard what Garnacho had to say about his team before the match, De Ketelaere took the opportunity to goad the Chelsea star after scoring the winner at Stadio di Bergamo.

Speaking shortly after full-time, the Belgium international quipped to Sky Italia: ""Now he knows who we are. For us, it's not possible to play games like Saturday's against Verona and then maybe win a match like today. We need to improve our consistency.

""We were coming off three wins and then there was this bad defeat, but we know we have great quality, and we proved it today.

""The most prestigious victory for us was the one in Dublin (the Europa League final in 2024), but if we want to play these games next year too, we need to do well.""

Maresca claimed his side could have avoided the defeat, stating: ""After the goal we conceded, we lost control. Second half, we had two good chances to score the second one. When we conceded the 1-1, we lost some concentration. We can avoid both of the goals we conceded. They're easy goals.

""For sure, we conceded two goals that for me we can avoid. When you concede, the first one is the moment when you can't lose the control of the game but I have a feeling that we lost the control of the game after the goal we conceded.""

There is little time for Chelsea to lick their wounds, however. They host Everton and then visit Cardiff City in the Carabao Cup before clashes with Newcastle United, Aston Villa, Bournemouth and Manchester City during the festive period. They'll look to push closer towards the Champions League's top eight places in their last two league phase games against Pafos and Napoli.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Problem solvers, big hitters & fast learners: Inside the Prizmic, Budkov Kjaer & Tien games","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/next-in-line-inside-my-game-december-2025","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 13:11:43 GMT","

They arrive on the ATP scene from different corners of the tennis world, but Dino Prizmic, Learner Tien and Nicolai Budkov Kjaer share a common thread. Each has forged early career's through setbacks, adaptation and a relentless commitment to improvement. Whether through tactical reinvention, rapid physical development or injury recovery, the trio is carving distinct paths toward the top of the game.

For Prizmic, a breakthrough didn't come with a trophy or a headline moment, it came during an unwanted pause. A wrist injury in 2024 forced the Croatian to the sidelines for months, a stretch he describes as “a very tough moment.”

“When I had injury with my wrist, that was a very tough moment because I stopped with the tennis for a couple of months and after that, we solved that problem and I'm happy to be back and really pleased with what I could do in 2025,"" Prizmic told ATPTour.com.

Prizmic won a set against Novak Djokovic as a qualifier at the 2024 Australian Open prior to his injury. On his return in 2025, the Croatian captured two ATP Challenger Tour crowns and reached the quarter-finals at the ATP 250 clay-court event in Umag. The 20-year-old, who will make his debut at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF later this month, keeps his approach to tactics simple: trust your instincts.

“I think you just need to play your game and be focused on how you need to play,” Prizmic explained. “The result will come.”

The biggest leaps in Prizmic's level have been physical but he also has a music-fuelled process on match days: 

“My legs, my footwork and my backhand have all improved. I also have a good process in place on matches which helps. When I wake up, I put on music, get warm, think how I need to play and that's it. It has worked so far this year overall.""









If Prizmic is defined by simplicity, Budkov Kjaer is defined by energy. The Norwegian will make his debut in Jeddah after winning four Challenger Tour trophies in 2025. The 19-year-old also earned a tour-level win in Bastad.

“Someone watching me for the first time can expect a modern tennis game,” Budkov Kjaer told ATPTour.com in October. “A powerful serve, fast balls from both sides. I try to bring energy to the court, we're in the entertainment business.”

In the past year, the 2024 Wimbledon Boys' singles champion Budkov Kjaer has leaned into constant refinement. Even his biggest weapon, a serve that once dominated juniors at 125 mph, requires ongoing sharpening at Tour level. His willingness to adjust has already paid off. Mid-season, after working with his father to alter the mechanics of his serve, he surged to three ATP Challenger Tour titles. Reinvention for the 19-year-old isn't a moment, it's a cycle.

“I need to improve all areas of my game,” Budkov Kjaer admitted. “Tennis is a continuous improvement process. I think all the best players always reinvent their game, maybe especially after losing and learning.""

Access to elite training blocks with top players accelerates that cycle. Practising with the Nitto ATP Finals field in 2024, including warming up Jannik Sinner in Turin, left a lasting impression. And like many Nordic talents, he draws motivation from close to home.

“Casper [Ruud] has always inspired me,” Budkov Kjaer said. “He proved that it's possible to come from a small tennis country like Norway and achieve great things.”

Where Prizmic thrives in clarity and Budkov Kjaer thrives in power, Tien thrives in thought.

“I really enjoy the tactical aspect,” Tien told ATPTour.com. “You go out with a game plan and you adapt from the first point. You're problem-solving around what the other guy is giving you, and he's doing the same to you. I think that's really fun.”

Tien, a Tour-level champion in Metz and a finalist in Beijing, doesn't overwhelm opponents with sheer force; he outthinks them.

“I wouldn't say I'm someone who often blows people off the court,” said Tien, who is at a career-high No. 28 in the PIF ATP Rankings. “But I do a great job of adapting and problem-solving.”

His improvements, particularly in his forehand and serve, have come through “a little bit of work each day” that compounds over time. And when it comes to match preparation, he aims for simplicity and calm.

“Preparation is done before tournaments,” Tien explained. “During events, it's just maintaining what you have. I don't like thinking too much before matches, sometimes that stresses me out. I just keep things simple.”

Unlike many rising stars, Tien doesn't model himself after a specific player. Instead, he absorbs bits and pieces from everyone around him.

“I have no ego about acknowledging other players' strengths and trying to take what I can,” he concluded.

The 35-time Grammy winner will lead the event alongside Nicole Kidman and Venus Williams.

	Hannah Dailey



Beyoncé can give high fashion in a simple white tee and her Levi's jeans, and that's exactly why she's the perfect fit to co-chair fashion's biggest night. (Although she'll probably pull on something a little bit fancier for the 2026 Met Gala.)


	As announced Wednesday morning (Dec. 10), the pop superstar will helm the 2026 event alongside Oscar winner Nicole Kidman and tennis champion Venus Williams, with Vogue posting a video on Instagram set to Claude DeBussey's “Claire de Lune” displaying their names. The graphic of a white curtain drifting elegantly against a marble wall also spells out next year's Met theme: “Costume Art.”

	











	“At the 2026 #MetGala, the @MetMuseum will celebrate its spring @MetCostumeInstitute exhibition, titled ‘Costume Art,'” the caption reads. “Set to host the fête? Major forces from the worlds of entertainment, sport, and, of course, fashion.”


	In addition to the chairs and theme, Vogue revealed on its website that Anthony Vaccarello and Zoë Kravitz will lead the 2026 Met Gala Host Committee, which so far includes members Sabrina Carpenter, LISA of BLACKPINK, Doja Cat, Gwendoline Christie, Alex Consani, Misty Copeland, Elizabeth Debicki, Lena Dunham, Paloma Elsesser, Chloe Malle, Sam Smith, Teyana Taylor, Lauren Wasser, Anna Weyant, A'ja Wilson and Yseult.

	











	Of the theme — which, in keeping with tradition, will be paired with a museum exhibit opening at New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art, this year curated by Andrew Bolton — Vogue writes that “Costume Art” will “explore the relationship between clothing and the body beneath” with a series of “thematic body types, ranging from the Naked Body to the Pregnant Body and the Aging Body.”


	The news is especially exciting for Bey and her fans, who haven't seen the 35-time Grammy winner walk the Met steps since 2016. That year, she matched the “Manus x Machina” theme in a beaded peach Givenchy Haute Couture gown. The year prior, she wore a show-stopping, sheer, colorfully bedazzled dress on theme with the night's “China: Through The Looking Glass” exhibit. 


	In 2014, Bey wore an elegant black design with netting draped over eyes for the “Charles James: Beyond Fashion” installment, and in 2013, she stunned in an intricate, black-and-gold gown with matching boots for “Punk: Chaos to Couture.”

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


	A federal judge said that the Trump administration must end its deployment of National Guard in Los Angeles, troops that were sent to the region despite the objections of Governor Gavin Newsom. 


	“The Founders designed our government to be a system of checks and balances. Defendants, however, make clear that the only check they want is a blank one,” U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer wrote in a ruling issued on Wednesday. 


	His order was stayed until Monday, and the Trump administration indicated that it would appeal. The judge also ordered that the guard be returned to Newsom's control.

	











	Newsom challenged Trump's authority to send in the National Guard in June. The guard, along with Marines, were sent to protect federal property amid protests of ongoing Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The judge wrote, “Six months after they first federalized the California National Guard, Defendants still retain control of approximately 300 Guardsmen, despite no evidence that execution of federal law is impeded in any way—let alone significantly. What's more, Defendants have sent California Guardsmen into other states, effectively creating a national police force made up of state troops. In response to Plaintiffs' motion to enjoin this conduct, Defendants take the position that, after a valid initial federalization, all subsequent re-federalizations are completely, and forever, unreviewable by the courts. Defendants' position is contrary to law.”


	White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement, “President Trump exercised his lawful authority to deploy National Guard troops to support federal officers and assets following violent riots that local leaders like Newscum refused to stop. We look forward to ultimate victory on the issue.”


	Earlier this year, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Trump's authority to seize control of the guard, but Newsom and the state of California sought a new ruling given the lack of an emergency and the administration's own drawdown of troops, which initially numbered in the thousands.

	











	“Donald Trump diverted these brave men and women from their vital public safety operations and deployed them against the very communities they took an oath to serve,” Newsom said in a post on X. “Today's ruling is unmistakably clear: the federalization of the California National Guard must end.”

Senior Film Reporter


Johnny Depp will produce the first English-language feature adaptation of The Master and Margarita, the classic satirical novel from Soviet author Mikhail Bulgakov, Deadline has confirmed.


	Depp shared the news in an appearance to promote the project at Saudia Arabia's Red Sea Film Festival on Wednesday. Contrary to what has been reported elsewhere today, he is not currently attached to star. No word yet on who wrote the script, and a director has not yet been attached. 


	Depp will produce alongside Stephen Deuters and Stephen Malit under his IN.2 Film banner, alongside Svetlana Dali, Grace Loh, Natalia Rogal, and Robert MacLean for Tribune Pictures. Exec producers include the late Michael Lang, Nevin Shalit, Andrew Fourman World Visions' Konstantin Elkin and Tribune Pictures' Michael Paletta.

	Written during the 1930s under Stalin but unpublished until decades after Bulgakov's death, The Master and Margarita is considered one of the great works of 20th century literature. Set between 1930s Moscow, where the devil returns with his talking cat to cause havoc amongst its corrupt citizens, and Jerusalem during the time of Pontius Pilate, the book tells a fantastical, satirical tale of love, artistic freedom and the eternal battle of good versus evil. A third intertwined story follows a struggling writer and his lover, Margarita, who is willing to do anything to save him from the totalitarian system. 

	











The Master and Margarita has sold more than 100 million copies worldwide in over 40 languages, inspiring generations of cultural icons across music, literature and film — from The Rolling Stones and David Bowie to Patti Smith and Federico Fellini.


	Depp was one of Hollywood's biggest and most in-demand stars until his extended legal battle with ex-wife Amber Heard, leading to a period in which he wasn't seen in studio movies. Most recently seen in international titles like Minamata and Jeanne du Barry, he's spoken about feeling “boycotted” by Hollywood in the wake of the saga with Heard and indicated that he might be done with the town. But now, he's in the midst of a comeback, having been tapped to star in multiple studio projects. First, he wrapped production on Day Drinker, a Lionsgate action-thriller from Marc Webb that reteamed him with frequent co-star Penélope Cruz. More recently, he's signed on to star in Paramount's Ebenezer: A Christmas Carol, a retelling of the classic Charles Dickens story from director Ti West, on which we were first to report.


	Depp is represented by Jack Whigham at Range Media.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Inside Taylor Swift's special ‘End of an Era' screening for family, friends and her tour crew","https://pagesix.com/2025/12/10/entertainment/taylor-swift-makes-surprise-appearance-at-end-of-an-era-screening-for-family-and-tour-crew/","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 15:48:00 GMT","

Taylor Swift is celebrating the end of an era with the people who made it all possible.

On Tuesday in New York, the “Life of a Showgirl” songwriter held an intimate advance screening of the first two episodes of her upcoming six-episode Disney+ docuseries, “The End of an Era,” where she described her nearly two-year-long, 149-show Eras Tour as “a lifetime within my lifetime.”

Clad in a ribbed black turtleneck, pleated miniskirt and knee-high heeled boots, the woman of the hour addressed her guests before the projectors started rolling.

“There's a lot of magic and mystery that happens when something goes as well as this [tour] did,” Swift told the crowd, which included her Eras dancers, backup singers, choreographers, band members and styling team. (Packs of tissues were thoughtfully placed near their seats in anticipation of the doc's more emotional scenes.)

The superstar's family (parents Scott and Andrea Swift and brother Austin) were also at the special event, as were a few media friends including Gayle King, Robin Roberts and Hoda Kotb. Swift sat with her dancers during the screening, and stuck around afterward to personally greet everyone who attended.

The first two episodes of “The End of an Era,” which documents the making of the musician's record-smashing tour, will begin streaming on Disney+ starting Friday, Dec. 12 at 12 a.m. PT — one day before Swift's 36th birthday. 

The next two episodes will arrive the following Friday, Dec. 19, and the final two on Dec. 26.

Starting Dec. 12 at 12 a.m. PT, fans can also stream “Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The Final Show,” a concert film recorded at Swift's final Eras performance in Vancouver on Dec. 8, 2024.

Unlike “Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour,” the movie she released in 2023, this updated cut includes the “Tortured Poets Department” section of the show, which Swift added to her 3.5-hour set midway through her tour.

Jewel is basking in the joys of island time.

Taking some R&R during the coldest season of the year, the singer shared some snaps from her Barbuda vacation, including two photos wearing nothing but a brown and white zebra-striped bikini.

The caption read, “#Barbuda for a few days of sun before more winter snow.”

In the first photo, Jewel is standing in front of the idyllic oceanside backdrop, followed by a mirror selfie from her hotel room.

In subsequent pics, she includes a beachside seafood grill as well as more ocean views.

Fans' comments praised the youthful performer, with many fire emojis and statements like “You look amazing!!” “Thirst trap!!!” and “You've aged like a fine wine!”

Two weeks ago, the singer was bundled up in a lime-green fringe coat from Gucci with cozy white winter accessories, riding —and singing — on the Holland America Line float during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.

The 51-year-old began this year facing backlash for her decision to perform at Robert F. Kennedy Jr's Make America Healthy Again ball.

Taking to Instagram after the performance, she apologized that she had “caused pain,” particularly to the LGBTQIA+ community and her fans, describing them as “treasures.”

While most of us brace for the chill, the singer's vacation photos make us feel at least a little bit warmer… 

At least through digital osmosis.

This holiday season, sci-fi lovers who want to get swept away to an extraterrestrial world can enjoy the dizzying heights of James Cameron's last Avatar installment. But those who can't make it through that film's three-hour runtime might also consider Ella McCay—a lighthearted gubernatorial comedy that somehow feels more alien than a whole community of Na'vi.

Thus is the curious case of James L. Brooks, the legendary Mary Tyler Moore Show and Simpsons creator who went on to write and direct cinematic classics like Terms Of Endearment and As Good As It Gets. In his heyday, Brooks had a gift for combining the rhythms of screwball comedy with a touching humanism that made his prickly-sweet projects feel like nothing else out there. But starting with 2004's Spanglish, that balance began to wobble. The characters in Reese Witherspoon's 2010 dramedy How Do You Know behave so strangely, it may as well take place in an alternate dimension. And though the 85-year-old writer-director clearly wants to recapture the magic of Broadcast News with his first film in 15 years, Ella McCay is another delivery straight from the uncanny valley.

It's not that there's one particularly egregious extraterrestrial element about the 2008-set political comedy, which charts three chaotic days in the life of Ella McCay (Emma Mackey), the 34-year-old lieutenant governor of an unnamed state. It's that everyone acts about 10% off from a screwball comedy character and 15% off from an actual human being, leaving the film and its ensemble stuck in a dramedy no man's land. One of the recurring “jokes” is that Ella struggles to hear her State Trooper driver (Kumail Nanjiani), even though he's speaking at a normal volume and she's just in the backseat. Another involves a (weirdly wholesome) sex scandal that's introduced like it's going to be a big deal and then resolved like it's nothing. 

That “all set-up, no payoff” feeling is all over Ella McCay. Brooks spends a lot of time detailing Ella's unhappy family backstory—from her womanizing dad (Woody Harrelson) to her long-dead mom (Rebecca Hall) to the steely aunt who helped raise her (Jamie Lee Curtis). But it never adds up to a cohesive portrait of a complicated woman. Ella's politics are vague (she's pro-moms, anti-weed, and weirdly obsessed with cavities), her talents are ill-defined (she cares about her constituents!), and her communication skills are so poor it's a wonder she's made it in politics at all. Ella's deep longing to be “normal” doesn't ring true when she's already so basic; a Cathy cartoon by way of Rory Gilmore.

It's a disconnect that throws off the stakes of the story. Though Ella's anti-establishment approach supposedly makes her a dogged thorn in the side of the political elite, she mostly comes across like a timid pushover who kowtows to the wishes of her image-conscious husband (Jack Lowden) and her gladhanding boss Governor Bill (Albert Brooks). In her personal life, meanwhile, she's presented as an overburdened eldest daughter who will drop everything to go check on her troubled little brother Casey (Spike Fearn) when he doesn't show up to one of her political events. Only when she arrives at his apartment, it's clear they haven't spoken in over a year—a detail that further adds to the weird alien quality of the film's emotions. 

The truth is that Brooks' off-kilter dialogue has always required a powerhouse performer like Debra Winger or Holly Hunter, someone who can grab the reins of the material and wrestle a beating human heart out of it. Mackey, however, never rises above being placidly likable in a “Netflix rom-com heroine” kind of way. She delivers what's asked of her, but there's no extra sparkle to her performance, no sense of depth lurking beneath the whimsical surface. Perhaps because of that, the supporting actors around her go as big as they can to compensate. Unfortunately, they go big in such different directions that no one generates actual comedic chemistry with each other.

But Brooks has enough filmmaking muscle memory that there are still moments in Ella McCay that work—from a tearful phone call between Ella and her aunt to some enjoyably cynical barbs from Governor Bill. Simpsons star Julie Kavner delivers the film's most locked-in performance as Ella's curmudgeonly assistant Estelle, who also doubles as the saga's quirky narrator. And there are times where the story finds a kind of West Wing charm to its idealized version of politics as a place where gumption still matters.

If anything, though, the movie works best as a sort of you-have-to-see-it-to-believe-it curio. The agoraphobic Casey gets a subplot with his ex-girlfriend (Ayo Edebiri) that's one of the strangest things put to film this year. At one point they slap a wig on 35-year-old Lowden to try to sell him as a 17-year-old. Brooks is inexplicably passionate about how a state cop skirting a “no overtime edict” might make for poor optics during the 2008 financial crisis. And there's a scene where it's unclear if Ella is giving an impassioned speech because it's something she believes in, or because she literally has a traumatic head injury.

It all adds up to a movie that isn't screwy enough to be a screwball comedy nor deep enough to be a dramedy. Ella McCay sees a bunch of people who have seemingly never met a human before attempting to celebrate the human spirit; it's a funhouse mirror version of reality that only gets more confusing the longer it goes. It's a film that can't be understood, just experienced. As one might tell the blue protagonist of Avatar, “Forget it, Jake, it's Ella McCay.”

James L. Brooks built a successful film career writing and directing romantic dramedies, the kind of films for adults that Hollywood supposedly doesn't make anymore. Most of his work centers upon headstrong women in crisis — his two classic 1980s films, “Terms of Endearment” and “Broadcast News,” being prime examples — and Brooks takes seriously their struggles in life, work, and love, even when they're sources of humor. Comedy and pathos act as companions in his films; scenes often begin funny and end sad (or vice versa), partly to juice the writing with unpredictable tension, but also because those modes are rarely siloed in real life anyway. Brooks' most beloved films garnered acclaim because people could see themselves in his characters and their dramas.

Of course, Brooks' worlds have better lighting, and an all-seeing author to provide a constant dialogue polish. His films were always stylized, featuring key performances heightened a few notches above naturalism, but Brooks took flight of reality with “How Do You Know,” his 2010 romantic comedy that flopped critically and commercially. I suspect that that film, which chronicles a love triangle between two professional athletes and a businessman indicted for stock fraud, threw people for a loop because its characters behaved less like real people and more like daffy archetypes from classic Hollywood, its milieu felt like an artificial construction instead of a convincing simulacrum of our world. Brooks' films were always influenced by the likes of Preston Sturges, Howard Hawks, and Ernest Lubitsch, but with “How Do You Know,” he embraced the farcicality of it all. 

 










“Ella McCay,” Brooks' first film in 15 years, takes a similarly fantastical approach, which will likely prove similarly divisive. Though technically set in 2008 during the lead-up to Barack Obama's inauguration, in an “unnamed state” that's clearly Rhode Island, the film basically takes place in the screwball version of that backdrop. Brooks cues the audience with storybook narration, delivered by Julie Kavner in her first on-screen role in nearly 20 years, that explains the film takes place during a time when “we all still liked each other.” Whether that introduction strikes you as impossibly naïve or a requisite leap of faith will determine if Ella McCay, both the film and the plucky protagonist, rings true.

The eponymous character, played by Emma Mackey (whose name, according to Brooks, did not inspire the film's title), is a lieutenant governor set to take over the post of her mentor, expert politician Governor Bill (Albert Brooks), after he accepts a post in the Obama White House. In classic Brooksian fashion, this simple succession plan becomes complicated by a potential scandal involving her social climber husband (Jack Lowden), the sudden return of her womanizing father (Woody Harrelson), and, well, Ella McCay's own stubbornly idealistic personality. Brooks also gives Ella a dead mother (Rebecca Hall) and a troubled brother (Spike Fearn), rendering the character a perfect storm of familial trauma, which makes her go-getter attitude all the more impressive.

 










While Brooks piles the film's various conflicts on top of each other, he gives each of them the barest of foundations, sketching them broadly and limiting details to their absolute necessities. The origins of Ella's disappointment with her father and the effects of her mother's death are given a brief flashback apiece; she communicates her justification for committing to an obvious snake-in-the-grass romantic partner, despite her otherwise discerning outlook, in a single monologue. Various relationships arrive at their endpoint and conflicts reach closure in similarly speedy fashion. Contemporary screenwriting tends to default to protracted repetition, either to justify the unbelievable or ensure clarity for distracted audiences. In “Ella McCay,” Brooks relies on actors to shade in the writing with credibility and charm through performances; the results are predictably inconsistent depending on the performer. (Albert Brooks does considerably better than Spike Fearn, for example.) Mackey does especially skillful work conveying the legibility of Ella's personal anxiety and political passion.

The dramatic shorthand Brooks deploys in “Ella McCay” might seem jarring relative to modern Hollywood offerings. Uncharitable viewers will likely find it inept. With all respect to the film's ensemble cast, largely comprised of veteran actors, this type of filmmaking fared better in a Hollywood of yore, which was filled with players capable of putting together entire characters in one scene, or even a single exchange. But there's an inevitable awkwardness watching present-day actors attempt to do the same. Still, most of them do fairly well with on-paper stock characters, either serviced by Brooks's direction or keen editing. Becky Ann Baker appears in one to scene as a plausibly manipulative mother-in-law to provide dramatic motivation for a crucial subplot. Kumail Nanjiani plays an accommodating driver/sounding board in scenes that feel slightly sitcommy but are designed to recall similar scenes where heroes confide with their put-upon domestic help, e.g., butlers or doormen, from early Hollywood. 

 










In a daring, roughly five-minute scene, Ella's brother convinces his ex-girlfriend (Ayo Edibiri) to get back together with him after not seeing each other for 18 months. No one would claim such a moment was unbelievable in, say, a Billy Wilder production, but it definitely feels a little clumsy here purely by the film's contemporary circumstances. But Brooks's trust in his actors actually pays off dividends here, even if the writing feels forced. There's a moment when Edibiri squats down in a fit of frustration only to fall on her butt and visibly pretend that she did it on purpose that feels like a classic Brooksian moment.

A strain of Frank Capra optimism runs through “Ella McCay” that will either wash as simplistic or charming. Ella is a politician whose primary concerns seem to be early dental intervention for children, mental healthcare for working mothers, and road infrastructure. She's a Washington employee who cares too much about policy and not enough about fundraising. The scandal that threatens her career involves carving out time for a personal life. Some of these details would probably seem too Pollyannish for a fantasy like “The West Wing,” but they make sense in the fanciful world Brooks creates, which is one where people win even when they lose, and villains seem down to Earth even when their comeuppance doesn't. Brooks's years honing his craft writing prickly characters and witty repartee ensures that not all of this scans as mindless escapism.

 










It goes without saying that some scenes are misjudged in terms of tone and length. Certain characters, particularly a rough-around-the-edges aunt played by Jamie Lee Curtis, feel like first-draft ideas that nevertheless persisted. And, yes, the occasional line of dialogue will feel improbably tin-earned and corny. However, what smooths out these bumps in the road is Brooks ability to still write an earnest speech or button a scene with a snarky rejoinder. Watching “Ella McCay” can sometimes feel like time travel, particularly for those vested in bygone eras of American filmmaking, but if you're capable of tuning into its wavelength, an old but worthwhile spirit can be found.

20th Century Studios will release “Ella McCay” in theaters on Friday, December 12.

	Brat Summer lives on at Sundance Film Festival, where Aidan Zamiri's The Moment starring Charli XCX will make its premiere. The film is based on an original idea by the musician and interrogates the layered complexities of pop stardom. Following “a rising pop star [that] navigates the complexities of fame and industry pressure while preparing for her arena tour debut,” it imagines how Charli's blockbuster album era might have played out had she made different decisions.


	Balancing out the metafiction of The Moment, Sundance 2026 will also see the premiere of Antiheroine, an “unfiltered and unapologetic” documentary about Courtney Love. Directed by Edward Lovelace and James Hall, a logline for the film reads, “Now sober and set to release new music for the first time in over a decade, Courtney is ready to reveal her story.”


	More music history will be captured through the world premiere of Tamra Davis' documentary The Best Summer, an “all-access view inside an era-defining moment in music” with behind-the-scenes footage featuring Beastie Boys, Sonic Youth, Foo Fighters, Pavement, Rancid, Beck, The Amps, and Bikini Kill. Davis previously helmed 2010's Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child, and directed Britney Spears in Crossroads. She also produced the Kathleen Hanna documentary The Punk Singer in 2013.

	The singer and songwriter Marianne Faithfull, who died earlier this year at age 78, will see her story captured in Broken English. The film from Jane Pollard and Iain Forsyth premiered at the Venice International Film Festival this summer, but will make its U.S. debut at Sundance. Broken English takes its title from Faithfull's 1979 New Wave comeback album.

	











	“Made with her full involvement, Broken English is an intimate and unflinching exploration of a fractured yet unbreakable life shaped by fame, creativity and relentless public scrutiny,” a description of the film reads. Broken English stars Tilda Swinton, George MacKay, Sophia Di Martino, Zawe Ashton, and Calvin Demba. It features appearances from Nick Cave, Warren Ellis, Jehnny Beth, Courtney Love, Suki Waterhouse, and Beth Orton.

Sundance 2026 will see director Joanna Natasegara make her documentary feature debut with The Disciple, which provides a look inside the making of Wu-Tang Clan's supposedly one-of-a-kind album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin. “It's like the Mona Lisa,” RZA told Rolling Stone about the album in 2018. “It's got its own folklore.” 


	“An outsider fueled by relentless determination works his way into the inner circle of the Wu-Tang Clan, where his ambition and creativity converge in the making of an album poised to ignite global controversy,” the logline for the release reads. 


	William Greaves will take the festival back to a different moment in time with Once Upon a Time in Harlem. The film, which as of this September was still incomplete, according to The New Yorker, surfaces footage from a 1972 reunion of figures from the Harlem Renaissance, which gathered passionate and creative minds with nuanced and critical insights into race, politics, art, and more. Greaves helmed the event and captured it all on film, but died in 2014 at the age of 87 without ever releasing the footage.

	His wife, Louise Archambault Greaves, chipped away at the project until her death in 2023. Once Upon a Time in Harlem was then passed on to the couple's son David, who directed the version premiering next year. Figures that appeared at Greaves's party, and made it into the film, include Eubie Blake, James Van Der Zee, Gerri Major, Jean Blackwell Hutson, Richard Bruce Nugent, and others. 


	Also premiering at Sundance 2026 is Paralyzed by Hope: The Maria Bamford Story. Directed by Judd Apatow and Neil Berkeley, the documentary builds on the comedian's candid explorations of mental health. “Blurring the line between performance and personal crisis, comedian Maria Bamford turns her mental health journey into material that's riotously funny and ultimately inspiring,” a description of the film reads. “What emerges is a portrait of an artist transforming vulnerability into creative strength through honesty.”

	When the Moody Blues entered the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in April 2018, co-lead singer Justin Hayward accepted the honor alongside drummer Graeme Edge, keyboardist Mike Pinder, bassist-singer John Lodge, and original frontman Denny Laine. “We're just a bunch of British guys,” a beaming Hayward told the crowd at Cleveland Public Hall. “But, of course, to us and to all British musicians, this is the home of our heroes. It's all the people that have come along and changed the world.”


	In the years since that long-overdue celebration, the world of the Moody Blues has been rocked by a devastating, improbably high number of deaths in a short period of time that leaves Hayward as the only living member inducted that night. (Lodge died in October, and we lost Pinder in 2024, Laine in 2023, and Edge in 2021).


	It's a reality that becomes even grimmer when you factor in the death of original bassist Clint Warwick in 2004, flutist-singer Ray Thomas weeks before the 2018 induction, and mid-Sixties bassist Rod Clark this past March. The only living musician other than Hayward with a credible claim to being a genuine Moody is 1980s keyboardist Patrick Moraz, but a jury of his peers disagreed when he sued the band for wrongful termination in 1992, and the Hall of Fame affirmed that decision when they opted to not induct him.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The Moody Blues have been completely inactive since a series of West Coast concerts in late 2018, but Lodge and Hayward kept the music alive throughout the past seven years by playing it on their own separate solo tours across North America and Europe. But after Lodge's sudden death in October, Hayward is left flying the Moodies flag all on his own.

	











	We caught up with Hayward via Zoom at his home in a “small village near the French side of the Italian border” to chat about the long history of the Moody Blues, his status as the last survivor, and what he plans to do going forward to keep the legacy alive.


We last spoke in 2017 when the news broke about the Moodies getting into the Hall of Fame. How have you processed everything that's happened since then?It's curious how many people have said that to me. And … I'm not wrestling with that. It's not like family. I don't have the same feelings as when I lost my brother, who died very young. I don't have those same feelings.

	It seems that I'm expected to go through different processes, but I only have good and happy memories, really. I can't say that we were close or that we saw each other regularly, or anything like that. The Moodies is a family, in its way, because it'll always be linked because of business.


I want to go through some of the history here. When you joined in 1966, they were essentially a one-hit wonder band.That's rather cruel.


I'm not putting them down. I love “Go Now.” I love that first record. It's just they had only the one hit and were fading when you came in.Well, I think if the group had wanted to continue the R&B style, they'd probably picked the wrong guy in me. And I wasn't being much help to them along those lines. It didn't really suit me.


	I came to the Moody Blues really thinking of myself as a songwriter. I was very happy to get the call from Mike [Pinder] that day. He called me because he heard my songs. He didn't know what I looked like, except that my mother had given me a big buildup, because he called my mother first. And then my mother found me at some music shop. I think even at that first meeting with Mike Pinder we had discussed wanting to do our own songs, because he was writing, and we were the only two people in the band who were writing songs at that time. And so that was his way of trying to make the band move forward.

The Beatles were going through an incredible creative evolution at the time. In what ways did they inspire you creatively?It's hard to explain the impact of the Beatles, now, to people who weren't there in the 1960s. But every move they made, everything they said, everything they recorded, everywhere they went, influenced everybody in that quite small London scene. Of course, it impacted the whole world, everything they did, but they were the kings of that particular small world in London at that that time. It was a group of a few hundred people, and we were very much in the middle of that. They were the leaders in everything that they did. And you could not help be aware of the changes that they were making.

	











	I remember walking down the street after hearing “Love Me Do” on the radio for the first time, and knowing that the world was going to be different. Now, how did I know that? But there was something in just one record, that it was like “Hallelujah!” And then I remember there was a man, I think his name was Steve Race, who came on the BBC a week or so after this. And did that usual thing about, “Oh, they'll never last. It's a one-hit wonder,” kind of thing. And everybody was like, “What? How dare you say things like that?” We took things completely personally about the Beatles.


It's sort fascinating to think that as they're recording Sgt. Pepper, you guys are making Days of Future Passed at basically the same exact time.Yes. In fact, Mike was visiting the studio in Abbey Road, because it wasn't far away from Broadhurst Gardens. But our circumstances were very different. We had nothing. But the stars aligned to help us make Days of Future Passed.


How did the Mellotron change the way you guys created music?Well, it made my songs work. Before that, the song that we most liked was a song called “Fly Me High,” and that really centered around Mike's piano. And as I said, we were kind of struggling. I think our price had dropped to less than 50 pounds a night.


	We came back from some gigs in a cabaret, up in the north of England. We were doing the kind of rhythm and blues set, and some guy came in the dressing room afterwards. We thought he was going to say the usual kind of complimentary sort of things, but he didn't. He said, “I've got to tell you that you're the worst group I've ever seen in my life, in this venue. And somebody's got to tell you.”


	I think Ray started crying, and then I did. And when we were on our way back to London in the van, nobody spoke. And Graeme had a place in the back of the van that he'd made on some equipment. And when we got to about Scotch Corner, which is halfway back to London, I heard this little voice coming, from Graeme in the back of the van saying, “He's right, that bloke, we're crap. We've got to do something.”


	And really, Mike had that sort of light-bulb moment. “I know where there's a Mellotron.” He worked for Mellotronics, and he and I went up to the Dunlop Social Club in Birmingham, fishing out of the corner of this social club, and we bought it for about 20 or 25 pounds.

	











I've heard a lot of stories from bands like Genesis about how impossible it was to bring that thing on tour.It was extremely awkward, and it broke down at one of our first gigs in America in '68, which was the Fillmore East in New York. John Mayall was on the bill, and I think he was secretly sniggering with glee that our Mellotron had broken down. But we took all of the transformers and amplifier parts out of it, and duplicated the orchestral sounds. Because they were really invented as a sound-effects instrument, with trains going through tunnels, and cockerels in the morning, and that kind of stuff. And so we duplicated all of the orchestral sounds, so they were kind of instantly double-tracked, and that was the sound of our Mellotron.


Did band politics get tricky once you became successful?If there were tensions in the group, it's because we became two groups. We were a recording band that was quiet, with the acoustic guitars at the front, and the Mellotron with that big spread. And then we became a touring band that had to get louder and louder and louder. And some of us didn't mind that. Me and John and Graeme didn't really mind that, but Mike didn't like the loud version. He liked the studio version.


How did you feel about the prog scene that rose up in the early 1970s, groups like Yes, Jethro Tull, and Genesis, that all clearly took some elements of what you guys were doing?I wasn't paying attention to them. I think my record collection was elsewhere. And I think the moment of our first tour of America just sent me personally off in a different direction. There were a couple of gigs we did with a group called It's a Beautiful Day, who I just thought were sensational, and very kind of graceful in their performance. And we did a couple of gigs with another group called Love, and then Jefferson Airplane, of course. So I think that we went off on a tangent, an American kind of tangent, with our music and our musical influences. I don't think we were that conscious of what was happening in the U.K.


You've been called “proto-prog,” but you were never doing the 30-minute songs or long keyboard solos or anything. You had a very different sound.Well, for me personally, I was just trying to write a really great pop song. And I think that was incorporated into the themes, that most of the time were led by Graeme. And of course, the spoken word gave us that reputation, as well.

	











The band had incredible momentum in 1972 with Seventh Sojourn and “I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band).” You were never more popular. Why did you decide in that moment to take off five years?Well, nothing was said that couldn't be unsaid. That was nice. But we got to the end of a long world tour, and we just didn't make any plans. I suppose it goes back to that thing, “Which group do you want to be in? Do you want to be the recording band that's sounding more and more kind of American, or do you want to be the touring band that's louder and louder and louder?” 


	My amps had gone from an AC30 to a 50-watt Marshall to a 100-watt to a 200-watt, to a 200-watt with a slave [amplifier]. And I think Mike particularly was feeling uncomfortable. So it was just nobody signed up for any more gigs; there was nothing in the book, suddenly.


In the years the Moodies were gone, a lot of bands moved into football stadiums. Do you ever think about the alternate path they might have taken if they stayed together and continued with the momentum from Seventh Sojourn?Well, that's interesting, isn't it? No, I don't think so. I don't have any regrets about that, or yearning that it would have been different in any way. I was very happy in what I was doing, and the path that it led me, and it gave me an opportunity to do a couple of solo albums, to be part of an album called The War of the Worlds that has, to this day, given me great success as a solo artist around the world.


	I was the one, I think, at that time who was a bit lost. Because everybody else said, “Right, we're not doing anything. I'm going to plan this.” But I found myself in Los Angeles at the end of that tour; we'd finished in Japan. And I thought, “Well, I don't know what to do now. So I'll just go to Los Angeles, because that's where things seem to be happening, and I'll wait for the phone to ring.” And eventually it did.


During the time the Moodies weren't around, the punk movement broke out in New York and London. Groups like the Sex Pistols saw groups like the Moody Blues as the enemy. How did you feel about what was happening there?I don't think they thought of us as the enemy. It's curious. I always think about those records now, like the Clash and the Sex Pistols … I just thought Sid [Vicious] was just absolutely brilliant. But you could see it was a car crash waiting to happen. And, when you look back now, how well-recorded some of those things were. They don't sound scruffy or un-together at all. They're well thought out and nicely recorded. So if you're rebelling against that part of the music business, it didn't work for them. But no, maybe the fact that we were apart for five years kind of helped us, because at the end of that we just seemed to be able to breeze straight back in, and we fit right in somehow.

	











Mike left the band after Octave in 1978. How did his absence change things?Well, then we became four people looking for a keyboard player, and then it was Graeme who got connected with Patrick Moraz. And I think he really turned us on. His contribution was really large, from that time on, '79 through till the sort of mid-'80s.


	And then, personally, I think he just lost interest where he wanted to do other things. He wanted to really make it on his own. And not only had Mike left, but there was a kind of rupture with Tony Clark as well, who was the record producer. His personal life had changed so much that he didn't identify with being one of a particular group like the rest of us, somehow.


	We deliberately put ourselves in a situation where we would meet people, record producers. And Pip Williams was great, Alan Tarney, and then Tony Visconti a couple of years later, changed the whole world for us.


How was it for Ray and Graeme in an era of drum machines and synthesizers, and less flute? Was it tough for them to find their way into these albums?You really have thought about these things, more than I have. Well, that's interesting. Now, Graeme was totally on board with it. Of course, the first thing I did was rush out and buy myself a sort of time clock, a click clock I used to call it. And the first thing we did with that was a song called “The Voice” from Long Distance Voyager. And so, I got it all set because I had a nice home recording system, and then I would take my click clock and my stuff into the studio, and do it to a time code.


	Now, Graeme loved that. Graeme was totally on board with that, which was wonderful. There was none of that, “Oh, you've got to feel it, because the time needs to move.” There's none of that. He was totally in with it. And I think he got a LinnDrum himself that he was messing around with. So that was fine.


	Ray was a different kind of, because his writing was very sort of tongue in cheek, and looking at life in a particular lighthearted way. And so I think as a writer, he always … He was never at a loss in the group. Neither of them were. Both of them were big characters within the group.


In 1986, 20 years after you joined, the band suddenly has this giant hit and you're all over MTV and Top 40 radio. I'm sure it was surreal to suddenly have this whole new audience that maybe didn't even know your older work.Exactly. You're right. A lot of people did start with “Wildest Dreams,” really. And fortunately, I think we still looked good. I was coming up to the end of my thirties. We could carry it off.

	











	What was fortunate as well is that a couple of us had got really kind of skint. We had seen nothing, really, of the financial rewards of those earlier years. We were never celebrities. We were never on TV or anything like that. We never commanded a huge price for our appearances.


	But in the mid-'80s, we were starting to be offered so many live gigs that I think we just went with it, and that really did change our lives. The summer tours that we did, the double headers, say with the Beach Boys or Chicago…. I loved all that time. The wonderful sheds in America, that were such great places to play. And still are, I hope.


If you look back at that time, Paul McCartney and Mick Jagger couldn't get a hit. Bob Dylan was struggling. So many giants of the '60s were flailing, and you guys have this enormous smash.Well, Tony Visconti knew how to make a record.


A few years later, you found yourself battling Patrick Moraz in a courtroom, and the entire thing was broadcast on Court TV. That had to be a really strange moment.Yeah, well, what can I say? I had a house in West London, and I went out one day, and there was somebody outside the door with a great big bunch of papers. They just had to touch me with them. I said, “Excuse me?” “You're being served with this writ,” or whatever it was. It fell at my feet. And I thought, “What the fuck? Oh, well, these things happen.” Well, there wasn't a moment from the first day in the Moody Blues where we were without some kind of litigation, over some amplifiers or something going on.


	And so I ignored it, very stupidly, until we appeared onstage in California for the first time after that. And it happened to me again. The sheriff's department came up to me, in the center of the group, and served me with these papers. And then, of course, I had to take it seriously. And God forbid that anybody should be served with something in California, have to sit in a courtroom in California.


	We had, of course, had all the representation we could possibly muster. But we had to listen to the case against us that was…. I have to say the words “ambulance chaser” kind of representation that was against us. But it was actually brilliant, all the mud that was swung at us. I was sitting there when it was the other guys, not so much when it was me, and kind of thinking, “That's pretty clever. Because in that, there is a grain of truth, and 90 percent bullshit. But there is something in it.”

	











Was the Nineties a difficult time? After 1991 or so, a song like “Wildest Dreams” simply isn't possible anymore. Radio and MTV basically only cared about young acts.Well, a very fortunate thing happened to us, because a promoter in Colorado suggested that we might want to do a concert with the Colorado Symphony, at a place called Red Rocks. So PBS got on board with that. And I put a lot of work into that concert, into making it right. And that kicked off a whole decade of doing that.


	In most towns in America, there is a subsidized orchestra, a proper professional quality, brilliant orchestra. And our agent realized, “Hey, there's one of these in every town. You could do 58 different orchestras.” And so, once we'd got the parts, that's exactly what we did. And we built a reputation through the '90s of appearing with local orchestras. Which was a great time for us.


Why did Ray leave the band in 2002?The honest answer is that I don't actually know. His health wasn't good, and he was having to sort of drag himself up onstage. It was really tough for him, getting out there every night. And I think me, John, and Graeme were, particularly with three dicks like us, full of energy like, “Come on, yeah, let's do it. We're great, girls, oh, it's fantastic.” Ray was kind of struggling. He had to have a chair onstage. And I could see it coming.


	The last thing I wanted for him was that he should be unhappy. It came home to me one day when I called him about a tour. It was close to Christmas, like about this time of year, and we were talking about early the next year to do some stuff. And we were just having a general chat. And then I said about these dates that were coming in, and he said, “Well, I don't think I'm going to do it.” And so I said, “Well, never say never, eh? You know, Ray?” And he came out with a great line. He said, “You can say what you fucking want, but I'm not coming.” I thought, “Right, I got it. Understand, Ray. I understand.”


Did you stay close to him after he left? Did you talk to him much?A little bit, but if you leave a group, you don't tend to stay friends…. No, “friends” is not the right word. You don't tend to stay in each other's company, do you?


It's tough to play drums every night when you get older. How did Graeme manage in his final years of touring?Always happy. The group meant everything to Graeme. His love for the group…. Well, I didn't know anything else like that. He wouldn't hear anything against it. Whatever we did, his advice and opinion was always for the best, always only wanting the best for the group. And I think that where we did need my click clock and my LinnDrum, he fiddled around for a couple of years trying to get it with him onstage, and him pressing buttons and stuff like that.

	











	In the end, I think we all agreed: “Maybe we'll get another guy who is just a clock player. That the only thing that matters is the time.” I think, actually, I would have to say that in any recording, time is the most important thing. It helps the groove, and everything.


	He was all on board with finding somebody to go to be with him onstage, a second drummer, to absolutely keep that time. And he could be free to do his thing, because the sound of his drums were the best-sounding drums I've ever heard. I often would go with him up from Charing Cross Road to drum stores, to try and choose things for him. And the sound of his drums was beautiful, and he had a light, light touch.


What was it like seeing Mike again at the Hall of Fame? Did you guys reconnect?Yes, absolutely. I'd seen Mike a couple of times over the years. In fact, he'd come to see me in one of my solo shows. Married to a beautiful girl. I think that the issue was actually between Graeme and Mike. That was to do with Graeme's devotion to the band, and Mike wanting to do other things outside of the band, or not to be there. Not to make it a 24-hour-a-day job. I'm not sure whether they reconciled it, actually.


When you guys got into the Hall of Fame, did you know the touring days were coming to an end?That's a really good question. I don't know. Were there any tours planned in 2019? And then of course, the world did end, really, during Covid, didn't it? For me personally, I have to say when Graeme Edge passed, I think it really did change things for me.


There was no farewell tour. Were you offered anything like that?No, I don't think there was. It just seemed, for me, time. It was time. And I'm very lucky to have my own things, and always an outlet for my songs, and fortunate as a vocalist that I've been asked to do things as well.


Did John agree it was time, or did he want to keep the band going?I don't know. I'm not sure that we saw each other. After that 2018 tour, I'm not sure whether we even saw each other after that, because of Covid. And then, we came out of that all a little bit different.


The last show was in La Jolla in 2018. Did you walk offstage thinking to yourself that it was over?This is something that, it's hard to describe, really. But right from the beginning, right from the start, there was never any plan or any strategy. That never existed. So there was never meetings about, “What shall we do?” Or, “How should we do this?” Or something like that. Things just happened to us. We either did them, or we didn't.

	











	So many people love Days of Future Passed, and I hope it survives over the years. I think maybe the time has gone when people listen to things like that, but I don't know. But it's always assumed that there must have been a plan and a strategy, and a sort of blueprint for that and how it was going to happen. And there wasn't anything. It was just one afternoon, somebody saying something, and then the next afternoon you'd do it. And then it was happening. And that's the way it was with the Moody Blues. If you say that's the last gig, at La Jolla, there was no meeting about, “What should we do,” or anything like that.


You didn't speak to John in the last seven years of his life?I don't think so, no. But then, I didn't speak to Graeme either, much. I maybe had one call with him, or something like that. What we had in common was the group. That was what we were good at. That was our relationship. It wasn't a group of friends.


People always have this fantasy that people in bands are best friends. It's rarely true.I think with certain groups, Bono and Edge, it probably is true.


In recent years, people saw you touring solo and John touring solo, and presumed maybe there was some sort of falling out.No. No, not at all. Actually, certainly not. No plan or strategy about falling out, either.


He died rather suddenly. The news must have been shocking.Every one of the guys was, yes. Yes, the first one I think would have been Ray. That was shocking, and saddening. And then with Graeme, It's like, “Well, that's the end of that chapter.”


Denny Laine died too. Did you have a chance to talk with him at the Hall of Fame?I did. And I think I was probably the only one to speak with Denny because there were some bad feelings from when I joined, really. I knew him, not intimately, but I knew him just around, in the years before the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. And I was so glad that he was there. He was part of it. And I also think that Clint Warwick should have been given a mention, too.


At this point, it's really only you and Patrick Moraz left.Oh. I didn't know Patrick was still around.


Have you spoken to him at all since the lawsuit?No. No. I have my own life. I got my own stuff, my own family, and my own music. And I'm very lucky to have that. And I'm thankful every day to be a Moody Blue for the very best years of my life. And in such a great band. We didn't have to go and socialize all the time, but when we were onstage, or when we were in the studio, we were a great band. And the band that I wanted to be in.

	











Are you playing solo shows next year?Yes, yes, yes. I'm offered a lot of work, and I find myself saying yes to it. I've got great musicians around me, and I can call on great musicians, and I'm very lucky. I have a fantastic crew, devoted, who love this music.


Do you feel any sense of obligation to keep the music alive since it's down to just you?Well, I've got nothing else. So I've got my own music, of course. I'm lucky to have had solo things, all throughout the Moodys' life. And the only thing I try to be conscious of, I try in my touring life to be true to the way…. Because I'm doing my own songs, true to the way I wrote those songs, and to the way I made those demos. True to the sort of click clock that I used to use, and yes, the feeling of them. That's why my acoustic guitars are mostly to the fore, and my guitar tech, Josh. I've been teaching him how to play exactly like me, so that he can accompany me.


Do you ever think about any sort of farewell tour at some point?A farewell Justin tour?


Sure.I don't know. For me, it's about the voice. People say to me, “How do you look after your voice?” And I always want to say, “Well, my voice looks after me, really.” So as long as that's there. I practice quite a bit; I had a practice today. I've got a friend who's got a big room at the back of his house, and I was there today. Because I shout.


Are you working on a new record?I've got some projects going in the studio right now, yeah. And I'm sure they'll come to fruition. And there's so many things from my early days, from my mother who loved show tunes, and who played the piano, and was a very kind of theatrical person. She was a teacher, as were both of my parents, and both of them academics in their way. But some of the songs from those days, I'm still interested in exploring myself, and putting my own personality into them. But I know what people want from me, and I want to share that. I want to put myself into songs and to write more.

To wrap up here, I know you weren't close with the other guys, but you must really miss them on a musical level and the camaraderie you all shared.There was a time when it was wonderful, and then there was a time when it wasn't so. No, I don't miss anything. I don't miss anything, and I don't have any regrets. I'm just thankful that we had that time together. Yeah, I'm thankful for those times. I don't miss anything, and I didn't want to kind of re-create it with people who weren't there.

	











Right. Playing as the Moody Blues with other people would feel wrong.It wouldn't seem right to me. And I don't have any need to.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q='unidentified+flying+objects'","The CIA Just Dropped a Trove of UFO Files, And Some of Them Are Seriously Wild","https://vocal.media/fyi/the-cia-just-dropped-a-trove-of-ufo-files-and-some-of-them-are-seriously-wild","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 18:50:39 GMT","

Suppose you've ever felt that familiar shiver watching late-night reruns of The X-Files. Today feels a little bit like coming full circle. The CIA has quietly released hundreds of declassified documents, some dating back to the late 1940s and early 1950s, detailing investigations into unidentified flying objects.

Yep. Real reports. Real witnesses. Real government interest.

This was the same era when the U.S. Air Force recorded over 12,000 UFO sightings as part of Project Blue Book, and more than 700 of them stubbornly remained unsolved. Seems the CIA was paying very close attention, too.

To make things extra fun, the Agency even highlighted a list of documents they claimed Agent Fox Mulder would love, along with another set perfect for Agent Dana Scully, as if they were curating evidence for both the believer and the skeptic.

Below are two of the most fascinating cases from those files.

One report from 1952 reads as if it came straight from a sci-fi comic.

A man named Oscar Linke, traveling with his 11-year-old daughter near the town of Hasselbach, pulled over after a flat tire. While he was handling the situation, his daughter pointed out something in the distance. At first, Linke assumed it was wildlife, maybe deer. But as they walked closer, he realized it was something far stranger.

They stumbled upon two figures standing next to what he described as a massive, round object, something he could only compare to an enormous frying pan, measuring roughly 42 to 49 feet across. Around the rim were two neat rows of circular openings, and a tall cone-like structure rose from the top.

When Linke's daughter called out, the two figures hurried inside. One, he said, had a glowing bump on his chest that shifted from green to red. Moments later, flames shot out from beneath the craft, it lifted off, tilted horizontally, and shot away beyond the treetops.

Once the object vanished, Linke inspected the area and found a freshly dug circular impression in the earth, matching the shape of that odd cone on top of the craft.

He was so shaken that he even testified to a West German judge at the time. Not exactly your everyday roadside story.

Another report from the same year came from what was then the Belgian Congo (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Two glowing discs were said to be hovering above a major uranium mining region.

Witnesses described the objects gliding in smooth, sweeping curves, shifting shape depending on the angle, sometimes looking like plates, sometimes like oval discs, and sometimes nothing more than thin lines streaking through the sky.

A fighter pilot, Commander Pierre, attempted to chase them down. He gave up after 15 minutes, estimating the discs were flying at speeds of nearly 932 mph. He said they were metallic, somewhere between 39 and 49 feet wide, with a central knob that remained perfectly still while the outer ring spun at incredible speed.

The aircraft could move vertically, horizontally, and drop down close to the treetops, moves that would've crushed or cooked any human pilot inside. Pierre was convinced no person could have survived the violent rotations and heat.

The CIA's release didn't end with old reports. They included:

The timing of this document dump was interesting, too; it coincided almost perfectly with the return of the X-Files series. Coincidence? Marketing stunt? Cosmic synchronicity? You decide.

Whether you're a believer or a skeptic, these declassified files certainly make the UFO conversation a lot more interesting. They raise questions, big ones, about what exactly the world's governments have seen, studied, or quietly wondered about for decades.

Why release this now?

Why these documents?

And why, after so many years, do these sightings still sound like something out of our wildest imaginations?

Whatever the reason, one thing's clear: the truth really is getting harder to ignore.

Writing stories that blend fiction and history, exploring the past with a touch of imagination.

How does it work?

So, let's be honest, when someone says “giant,” most of us immediately picture Goliath, Jack and the Beanstalk, or that iconic Stay Puft Marshmallow Man (simultaneously terrifying and delicious). But in the real world, there's been a surprising amount of speculation that an actual race of giant humans once walked the Earth, maybe even living alongside early humans.

Mindset is one of those words we hear everywhere—from motivational speeches to business books—but few people actually understand how to use it, not just talk about it. A mindset isn't a magic spell or a switch you flip when life gets inconvenient; it's a deliberate mental framework that shapes how you interpret challenges, react to setbacks, and grow over time. When used correctly, your mindset becomes an internal compass—quiet, steady, and incredibly powerful.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=uap","Lue Elizondo warns Trump of “nightmare scenario,” ties UAP tech to cybersecurity threats","https://cybernews.com/news/elizondo-trump-uap-cybersecurity/","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 11:56:09 GMT","

© 2025 Cybernews – Latest Cybersecurity and Tech News, Research & Analysis.

Lue Elizondo, former Pentagon officer and UAP whistleblower, has sent a memo to President Trump urging action on UAPs, warning that these unexplained aerial technologies could pose not only physical but cybersecurity threats to national security.

“We can whitewash it all day long, and we can pretend it's not there. All it's going to do is erode the faith and confidence of the American people, because people know it's real,” Elizondo said. 

He told NewsNation's Reality Check with Ross Coulthart that he has heard several Congress members have had their own UAP experiences and are “very concerned about the topic.”

The secrecy surrounding UAP disclosure would put any reputable policymaker under the microscope, as well as face electoral consequences, with the groupthink of politics proving that conformity is the best option. 

“They don't want to come across as, you know, seeming to be fringe or anything like that,” Elizondo said.

Elizondo, the former director of the Pentagon's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), has proposed establishing a “UAP czar” to help centralize operations and provide accountability.

“My memo urges the president to appoint an adviser to handle the issue of UAPs and emerging technology.”

The rationale behind the memo is that there's currently a lot of fragmented reporting and siloed intelligence (such as the Pentagon's secret UFO program) regarding alien intelligence.

Whether deliberately or not, reports from whistleblowers or announcements about emerging technology often get lost, destroyed, or buried. In the interview, Elizondo sounds tired of the aforementioned whitewashing.

And he even goes as far as to say that we could find ourselves in a frightful situation should we continue to sweep the issue under the carpet.

The most startling part of the interview segment is when Elizondo pulls on one of the most sensitive and significant events in the US's modern history:  

“We're going to be in another really bad situation… an event that is going to potentially eclipse the impact if 9/11 had on our society.”

Far from claiming that aliens will attack a la Independence Day, Elizondo is showing that the strategic implications of UAP technology falling into the wrong hands are massive.

A “nightmare scenario” would emerge in the form of a rebellious upstart with catastrophic deviations: “Imagine some rogue nation… exploiting and reverse engineering capabilities associated with UAP. That's a nightmare scenario.” offered Elizondo.

Joe Rogan even lent his voice recently to put wind in the disclosure sails, to highlight the more covert tech war between the US and China.

UAP-like tech could enable surprise attacks or airspace dominance, and while one can get perplexed as to why the US dominates the UFO chronicles, Elizondo counters by suggesting a belligerent regime letting loose.

“Imagine some rogue nation like North Korea having the ability to exploit and reverse engineer just even some of the capabilities that we see now associated with UAP.”

Erika Kirk spoke publicly for the first time about the conspiracy theories surrounding the death of her husband, conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, denouncing any speculation as hurtful and unfounded during an interview on Fox News Channel's “Outnumbered.”

Kirk said she would “never back down” in defending her family and her late husband's legacy. She said she wants space to grieve with her children and protect her husband's resting place, adding that her silence in the face of conspiracy theories should not be mistaken for complicity. She added that the speculation has hurt the people closest to her and insisted she is “done” allowing unfounded claims to go unchallenged.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Marco Rubio has ordered diplomatic correspondence to stop using the Calibri font and return to the more traditional Times New Roman effective Wednesday, reversing a Biden administration shift to the less formal typeface that he called wasteful, confusing and unbefitting the dignity of U.S. government documents.

“Typography shapes how official documents are perceived in terms of cohesion, professionalism and formality,” Rubio said in a cable sent to all U.S. embassies and consulates abroad Tuesday.

In it, he said the 2023 shift to the sans serif Calibri font emerged from misguided diversity, equity and inclusion policies pursued by his predecessor, Antony Blinken. Rubio ordered an immediate return to Times New Roman, which had been among the standard fonts mandated by previous administrations.

“The switch was promised to mitigate accessibility issues for individuals with disabilities,” the cable said, asserting that it did not achieve that goal and had cost the department $145,000 but did not offer any evidence.

Since taking over the State Department in January, Rubio has systematically dismantled DEI programs in line with President Donald Trump's broader instructions to all federal agencies. The Trump administration says the goal is to return to purely merit-based standards.

Rubio has abolished offices and initiatives that had been created to promote and foster diversity and inclusion, including in Washington and at overseas embassies and consulates, and also ended foreign assistance funding for DEI projects abroad.




“Although switching to Calibri was not among the department's most illegal, immoral, radical or wasteful instances of DEI it was nonetheless cosmetic,” according to Rubio's cable obtained by The Associated Press and first reported by The New York Times.

“Switching to Calibri achieved nothing except the degradation of the department's correspondence,” he said, adding that it also clashed with the typeface in the State Department letterhead.

According to a separate memo sent to department employees, the return to Times New Roman takes effect Wednesday and all templates for official documents are to be updated to remove the offending Calibri font. 

The only exceptions are documents prepared for international treaties and for presidential appointments, which are required to use Courier New 12-point font, the memo said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","NFT Sales Hit New Yearly Lows","https://zycrypto.com/nft-sales-hit-new-yearly-lows-will-2026-fare-any-better/","Wed, 10 Dec 2025 13:39:05 GMT","

NFT sales have been a 2025 to forget so far, with the second half of the year showing a sharp monthly net decline, according to data from Cryptoslam. November was the worst month of the calendar year, with just $320 million in total sales. The reduced market activity represents a 66% decrease from the yearly high of just below $700 million witnessed in January. 

December is faring even worse with just $73 million in sales in the first 10 days. If the same downward trend continues, it will be the worst close of a calendar year since 2021. NFTs and the larger digital collectible market are currently fading away into the backdrop after missing the entire 2024-2025 bull(ish) season.

Here is the graph of the NFT performance over the years:

The black line shows the actual sales activity of these digital collectibles for the last 5 years, while the blue and orange lines represent unique buyers and unique sellers, respectively. It is clear that the NFT market is contracting exponentially, and barring a major price action, it could be relegated to the backdrop of the Web3 revolution. It had its major heyday in 2021-2022, with peak monthly sales of $6 billion in January 2022, but now it is only a fraction of that. Interest has plummeted to new lows, one after the other. 

Here is the graph of the total market capitalization of NFTs:

Currently, the NFT market is worth around $3 billion, down from its 2022 high of $17 billion, a 82.35% drop. The market cap has also lost 62% since the start of the current calendar year, which is another bearish sign. The only silver lining of the long-term NFT trend is that several blue-chip NFTs like Crypto Punks, Infinex Patrons, and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) have retained value over the years. 

Following a dismal 2025 performance, NFTs are looking to the incoming calendar year for a bullish reset. An anticipated roadmap is in place for that to happen. In many ways, the digital collectibles market is tied to the performance of altcoins, as historically, profits from the secondary crypto market have trickled down to NFTs.

However, altcoins have had a year to forget, as most top coins (except BNB) remain in deep bearish territory. If we experience a major altseason in 2026, the NFT market is likely to have its belated hurrah.

Amazon says it will allow authors to offer their DRM-free e-books in the EPUB and PDF formats through its self-publishing platform, Kindle Direct Publishing. Starting on January 20, 2026, authors who set their titles as DRM-free will see their books made available in these more open formats.

The decision to use Digital Rights Management (DRM), a copyright protection mechanism, is set by the authors when they publish their e-books on Amazon's platform.

The company notes these changes won't impact previously published titles. If authors want to change the status of older titles, they'll have to log into the Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) author portal and change an option in the settings. (Instructions on how to make that change are on Amazon's KDP support site.)

This move may actually incentivize authors to apply DRM to their e-books.

As one author on the KDP Community forums, Leslie Anne Perry, noted, “Previously, I have not enabled DRM on my e-books. My thinking was that I wanted folks to be able to download them to other devices within their own household. However, I think I will enable it on any future e-books. I'm not sure I want people to be able to download them as a PDFs [sic].”

Another member pushed back at the complaints, arguing that it doesn't really increase privacy, as those who had wanted to could always dump the existing DRM-free Kindle file into software to convert it into an EPUB or PDF.

Amazon is positioning the new feature as making it “easier” for readers to enjoy the content they've already purchased, but the reality is that authors would have to opt in if they want to open up access to their older works. To remove the DRM, authors will have to click a box that says, “I understand that by not applying DRM, customers who buy and have already bought this book will be able to download it as a PDF or EPUB file.”

Elsewhere, Amazon has been making it more difficult for Kindle owners to share or back up their e-books through heavier use of DRM in recent months.

With an update to Kindle's software for 11th- and 12th-generation devices, the retailer introduced a new DRM system that made it impossible for Kindle users to back up their e-books without jailbreaking their device. This had followed an earlier change to remove the download and transfer options via USB, which angered many Kindle owners.

After the author updates their e-book's DRM status, Amazon says the changes will take up to 72 hours before they are live on Amazon.com.

                Reading time 3 minutes
      

When Taylor Swift released her twelfth studio album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” in October, the album sparked record streams as well as an onslaught of criticism. While a portion of the online discourse it provoked was centered around whether or not the album was actually good, a parallel wave of attacks accused Swift and the album of promoting ultra-right-wing ideology.

Users across platforms claimed that the song “Wi$h Li$t,” in which Swift sings about her only wish being to settle down, was an implicit endorsement of MAGA values, even though the singer had publicly endorsed Trump's opponent, former vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 election. Some even claimed that a line in the song, in which Swift sings “have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like you” in reference to her fiancé, football player Travis Kelce, had white supremacist connotations.

Accounts also claimed that the lines “I'm not a bad bitch, and this isn't savage” in the song “Eldest Daughter” and “sleepless in the onyx night, but now, the sky is opalite” from the song “Opalite” were racist digs at Kelce's ex-girlfriend, who is black.

Other posts even claimed that a necklace merch with lightning bolts on it was actually a Nazi dog-whistle for vaguely resembling “SS.”

Now, according to new research from behavioral intelligence startup GUDEA, at least a good chunk of these online attacks were spurred by inauthentic social media accounts in what looks to be a coordinated attack on Swift's reputation.

GUDEA examined thousands of posts from 18,000 accounts across 14 social media platforms made in the first two weeks following the album's release, to find that the “Taylor Swift is a Nazi” narrative was spurred by accounts that behaved like bots. The inauthentic narrative acted as a catalyst for authentic conversations, like one comparing Swift to self-proclaimed Nazi Kanye West.

Surprisingly, though, it was the Swifties that inadvertently ensured that the attacks reached their intended impact. These false narratives were basically “rage bait” designed to provoke real users and strengthen the narrative's visibility. So ultimately, it was established accounts and influencers that took the false narrative from the confines of the fringe corners of the internet to the mainstream conversation. Every time a fan interacted with the false claims to refute them, it only fed the narrative for the algorithm.

“This demonstrates how a strategically seeded falsehood can convert into widespread authentic discourse, reshaping public perception even when most users do not believe the originating claim,” the researchers wrote, adding that the pattern is “a hallmark of successful narrative manipulation.”

It's not clear who orchestrated the bot attacks or what they could be gaining from this. But the researchers did find significant overlap between the accounts that pushed the narrative and accounts involved in a reputational attack campaign on actress Blake Lively, who is in the middle of a sexual harassment and online smear campaign lawsuit against actor Justin Baldoni.

GUDEA's head of customer success, Georgia Paul, told Rolling Stone that the culprits could also be nefarious actors asking themselves, “If I can move the fan base for Taylor Swift —an icon who is this political figure, in a way— does that mean I can do it in other places?”

Ultimately, what the incident highlights is just how scarily close our new digital reality has come to the “dead internet theory.” Bots are flooding all corners of the web, and they are actively shaping our own experience of it.

According to Cloudflare data, roughly 30% of all internet traffic is now bots. GUDEA founder and CEO Keith Presley's estimate is even higher at 50%.

“The internet is fake,” Presley told Rolling Stone on Tuesday.

 December 10, 2025  

Neflamapimod, an experimental, oral drug targeting neuroinflammation being developed by CervoMed, led to a significant reduction in a key blood biomarker of neurodegeneration, which correlated with a significant slowing of disease progression in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) in the phase 2b RewinD-LB trial.

Patients in the trial who reached target blood levels of the drug experienced less cognitive and functional decline compared with those receiving an older, less bioavailable batch of the drug, suggesting disease-modifying effects.

The findings were presented on December 4 at the 18th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) Conference.

DLB is an area of “high unmet need with no currently approved therapies in the US or Europe. With neflamapimod, we've got a well-documented scientific rationale and clinically validated mechanism of action and we're seeing a durable, clinically significant effect and a favorable, safety profile in patients with pure DLB,” John-Paul Taylor told conference attendees.

In an interview with Medscape Medical News, John Alam, MD, CervoMed CEO, noted that the average time from diagnosis of DLB to nursing home placement or requiring full-time assistance is only about 2 years.

“What our data with neflamapimod are showing is that globally, we are slowing, and to a great extent preventing, the progression of the dementia and the global dementia symptoms. This is fundamentally what patients are and caregivers are looking for,” said Alam.

DLB is a progressive alpha-synucleinopathy characterized by widespread cortical and subcortical Lewy bodies. In the early stages, a major driver of disease expression and progression is dysfunction and degeneration of the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons.

Neflamapimod is an oral p38-alpha kinase inhibitor that targets dysfunction and degeneration of acetylcholine-producing neurons. In the basal forebrain, there is accumulation of alpha-synuclein, which leads to neuroinflammation and hyperactivation of p38-alpha kinase, leading to pathologic sequelae, culminating in synaptic dysfunction, Taylor explained.

By inhibiting this kinase, neflamapimod aims to remediate this synaptic dysfunction and there is positive preclinical and phase 2a data to validate this drug target and support advancement to phase 2b, Taylor said.

The RewinD-LB phase 2b trial included 159 patients with DLB and had two parts: a 16-week, randomized, placebo-controlled phase trial where patients received neflamapimod 40 mg three times daily or matching placebo, and a 32-week open-label extension phase, where patients received neflamapimod 40 mg three times daily.

Neflamapimod capsules used in the initial phase (batch A) did not produce the expected and targeted plasma drug concentrations, resulting in no significant difference between placebo and neflamapimod on the primary endpoint of Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB).

In the extension phase, a new formulation (batch B) did achieve the expected and targeted plasma concentrations of neflamapimod, allowing a clear assessment of the drug's efficacy.

Achieving target concentrations of the drug in the extension phase led to a significant benefit on clinical progression — most prominently in the subgroup of patients with a low likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease co-pathology (< 21 pg/mL ptau181, the “pure” DLB subgroup), Taylor told attendees.

At week 16 of the extension phase, the mean change (worsening) in CDR-SB was 52% lower with batch B than with batch A in all participants and 82% lower in pure DLB subgroup, he noted.

The clinical effect was durable at 32 weeks, with a 65% reduction in the mean CDR-SB change when targeted plasma drug concentrations were achieved in all participants and 89% reduction in the pure DLB subgroup.

The risk for clinical progression, defined as ≥ 1.5-point increase in CDR-SB, was reduced by 67% with batch B vs batch A (P < .001) and by 75% with batch B vs placebo (P < .001).

The median time to progression was 16 weeks with batch A and 24 weeks with batch B. In batch B, the median time to progression “could not be achieved in the duration of the trial; and indeed, projecting it out, assuming that neflamapimod has a sustained effect, it would only lead to progression at 1.5 years — giving about a year of clinical stability,” Taylor reported.

Neflamapimod also led to clinically meaningful improvements in Clinical Global Impression of Change and multiple secondary and exploratory measures, including mobility, cognitive fluctuations, and neuropsychological test performance.

Achieving target levels of neflamapimod with batch B was also associated with a significant reduction in plasma levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein, a biomarker of neurodegeneration, and these changes correlated with clinical treatment response, “further supporting that neflamapimod acts on the underlying disease process,” Taylor said.

The drug was generally well tolerated, with low rates of discontinuation over 48 weeks of treatment. During the placebo-controlled portion of the study, 2.5% of neflamapimod recipients discontinued for liver enzyme elevation during the placebo phase and 1.3% during the extension phase. All events of liver enzyme elevation were reversible; none were associated with bilirubin elevation.

“The results build on a growing body of preclinical and clinical evidence and give us renewed confidence that we are moving closer to the first approved treatment for patients and their families,” Taylor said in a news release.

The company plans to launch a global phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trial in the second half of 2026. The study will enroll about 300 patients, focusing on those with pure DLB. Patients will receive oral neflamapimod or placebo for 32 weeks, followed by a neflamapimod-only 48-week extension phase.

“We now have two different studies that have shown neflamapimod acts on CDR sum of boxes. We believe that phase 3 will truly confirm what we have already seen,” said Alam.

The RewinD-LB study was funded by a $21 million grant from the National Institute on Aging, with additional support from CervoMed. Alam is an employee of CervoMed, and Taylor has consulted for the company.

Researchers from the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore (NUS Medicine), and NHG Health's Institute of Mental Health (IMH) have mapped how brain networks differ in individuals at Clinical High Risk (CHR) for psychosis, providing a new perspective on the mechanisms underlying the disease onset. Published in Molecular Psychiatry, the study utilized advanced neuroimaging methods to identify early, network-level changes in more than 3,000 individuals at varying levels of risk.

The study – led by Dr. Siwei Liu, Senior Research Scientist, and Associate Professor Juan Helen Zhou, Director, both at the Centre for Translational Magnetic Resonance Research (TMR), NUS Medicine, and in collaboration with Associate Professor Jimmy Lee, Senior Consultant Psychiatrist and Clinician-Scientist at IMH – sought to determine how brain networks can reveal signs in young individuals with heightened clinical risk of developing psychosis.

Using data from the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics by Meta-Analysis-Clinical High Risk (ENIGMA-CHR) working group, the team analysed brain scans from over 3,000 participants aged between 9.5 and 39.9 years across 31 global sites, including Singapore. The local data came from IMH's Longitudinal Youth-At-Risk Study (LYRIKS), which was initiated in 2008 and led by Assoc Prof Lee, to identify clinical, social, neuropsychological and biological risk factors unique to individuals at high risk of developing psychosis.

The study compared the brain network patterns between young people at high risk for psychosis and healthy individuals, as well as between those who later developed psychosis and those who did not. Using graph theory-based network analysis, they mapped how different brain regions communicate structurally. This approach treats the brain as a complex network, where nodes represent regions and edges represent their connections.

The team observed that in a healthy brain, regions that develop and work together form networks that balance strong local connections with efficient communication across areas. Regional neighbours share both direct and indirect connections, supporting effective local processing. Even with minor damage in one region, neighbouring regions can still communicate through alternate paths. Efficient long-range communication means that even far-apart regions can exchange information quickly using only a few steps.

However, the study found that individuals at high risk for psychosis had less efficiently organized brain networks than healthy individuals. This organization makes local processing less effective and integrative processing across the brain more difficult. Differences in frontal and temporal brain areas were also linked to whether an individual developed psychosis later in life and how severe their symptoms were, suggesting that brain network patterns may play an important role in the transition to psychosis. The findings also indicated that individuals at high risk for psychosis exhibited early disruptions in the organization of brain networks, despite showing only mild clinical symptoms.

""Treating the brain as a complex network has allowed us to capture subtle but meaningful differences in communication pathways,"" said Dr Liu, first author of the paper. ""These findings highlight the potential of brain imaging to detect early alterations and how early changes in network structure may contribute to the onset of psychotic symptoms."" Dr Liu is also a Senior Research Scientist at the Centre for Sleep and Cognition, NUS Medicine.

Assoc Prof Zhou, corresponding author of the paper, added, ""This study underscores that psychosis is not a sudden event but a progressive process reflected in the brain's communication networks. Individuals at high clinical risk already show distinctive patterns of reduced integration and local efficiency. Understanding these patterns gives us an opportunity to identify at-risk individuals earlier and with greater precision. Ultimately, integrating such imaging-based insights into clinical assessment could improve prognosis and allow for timely and preventive therapies."" Assoc Prof Zhou is also a Principal Investigator at the Centre for Sleep and Cognition, NUS Medicine.

Other collaborators of the study include Dr Maria Jalbrzikowski and Dr Dennis Hernaus, who chair the ENIGMA-CHR working group. Dr Jalbrzikowski is from the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Sciences, Boston Children's Hospital, United States of America, and Dr Hernaus is from the Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, Mental Health and Neuroscience Research Institute, Faculty of Health Medicine and Life Sciences, Maastricht University, Maastricht, the Netherlands.

This study represents a significant step forward in understanding the biological trajectory of psychosis. By examining nearly 3,000 young people across multiple sites, we now have robust evidence that brain network disruption follows predictable patterns years before clinical symptoms fully emerge. This isn't about finding a single faulty brain region, but understanding how the brain's systems gradually become less coordinated, which opens a crucial window for early intervention that we've never had before. Being able to identify possible onset of psychosis early would allow us to intervene before symptoms take hold, improve long-term outcomes and reduce the impact of psychosis on young people's lives.""

Associate Professor Jimmy Lee, Senior Consultant Psychiatrist and Clinician-Scientist at IMH

The study also suggests that the brains of young people at high risk for psychosis may be more vulnerable to certain types of damage, as observed in the reduced local backup connections and longer route between distant regions in the study. Young people at high risk for psychosis often face social difficulties, additional mental health issues, and a lower quality of life, creating a significant burden on them. Preventive interventions could help ease this burden and possibly reduce the risk of progressing into fully developed psychosis.

The study enhances understanding of how psychosis may develop through interconnected brain pathways, supporting the hypothesis that tissue damage can spread across these networks. This underscores the importance of studying brain organization to better trace the disease process. Building on these findings, the researchers plan to explore brain network patterns further with the goal of identifying biomarkers that could eventually support early detection and targeted interventions to lessen the long-term impact of psychosis.

DALLAS - Wanting to watch the 2026 FIFA World Cup live in Dallas? It is definitely possible!

Dallas is set to be a major hub for the tournament, hosting nine matches, including highly anticipated games featuring popular national teams like Argentina, England, and the Netherlands at AT&T Stadium.

This means you still have the chance to secure 2026 World Cup tickets and see legendary players, such as Lionel Messi, live at AT&T Stadium in Arlington.

Here is the latest information on how you can still get tickets for the Dallas matches.

What you can do:

If you missed the first two FIFA ticket drawings, don't worry. The third and perhaps most critical drawing is opening soon.

When: The Random Selection Draw opens Thursday, Dec. 11, at 4 p.m. CST.

How to Apply: You must log in using your FIFA ID credentials at the specified time. It is highly recommended that you create your account before 4 p.m.

Application Link: You can create an account and access the ticket portal HERE.

This third drawing is a significant opportunity because it is the first time that ticket purchasers will be able to know the initial match lineups before applying. You can select exactly which matches you want, the number of tickets, and your preferred seating areas.

Now that FIFA has announced which teams will play World Cup 2026 matches in North Texas, a big question that remains is whether any of those teams will make North Texas their primary base camp.

Keep the following rules in mind:

If your application is successful, you will not be notified of the details until February, when your credit card will actually be charged.

If you request tickets to multiple matches on a single application, it may be partially accepted. This means you may receive tickets for some matches but not all.

Drawing applications close on Jan. 13, 2026.

If you prefer to buy tickets closer to the start of the tournament, or if you miss this drawing, FIFA will release all remaining tickets on a first-come, first-served basis through its official website. The dates for these final sales phases are typically announced in the months leading up to the opening match.

Andy Dick suffered an apparent overdose after he was found unresponsive on a street in Los Angeles.

The comedian was seen slumped over on the cement stairs of a building in Hollywood on Tuesday, according to video obtained by TMZ.

Dick, who was dressed in a tan jacket, black tee, plaid pajama pants and black Crocs, was bent over as his glasses lay on the ground in front of him.

The actor was seen lying flat on the concrete as someone stood over him.

Several of Dick's pals ran over to him and attempted to revive him. 

One of the “NewsRadio” alum's friends reportedly screamed at Dick to “wake up” as others called an ambulance.

A bystander shouted for someone nearby to grab Narcan, a life-saving medication that quickly reverses opioid overdoses, and Dick was administered the shot.

A rep for the Los Angeles Fire Department told the outlet that they responded to the location for an overdose involving a 59-year-old male, who was not transported to the hospital.

Dick, 59, spoke to TMZ by phone Tuesday night, telling the outlet that he was alive and OK. He would not disclose exactly what happened.

Page Six has reached out to Dick's rep and the LAPD for comment but did not immediately hear back.

The former “Andy Dick Show” star has a long history of drug and alcohol abuse. 

He has also faced several run-ins with the law, including allegations of sexual misconduct and arrests. 

In 2022, Dick was ordered to register as a sex offender after being convicted of sexual battery in 2018. 

At the time, an Uber driver accused Dick of groping him and the former TV star was sentenced to 90 days in jail.
