                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Airbnb expects to host 17,000 guests at its short-term rentals across the Philadelphia region when the FIFA World Cup comes to town next summer. That's according to a new report, which was done by Deloitte at Airbnb's behest and released last week. Airbnb guests are expected to spend about $52 million on average during their stays in the Philly region, and about $14 million of that total will be spent on the rentals. Over the course of the six matches in June and July, Airbnb hosts are expected to rake in about $1,900 on average, totaling about $8 million in earnings for all area hosts, according to the report. » READ MORE: Brazil and France headline the teams coming to Philadelphia for next year's World Cup Airbnb's report estimates that 149,000 of them will require overnight accommodations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>IT'S WEDNESDAY AND THAT means one thing here at ASN – a look at the world of Americans abroad with a weekly column. The past week has been mostly quiet with a lot of injuries, suspensions, limited minutes, and unused substitutions. There are always high points to distract from the bad, but overall, it has been a decidedly mixed season in Europe for Americans. This past week was a good representation of that. Big goals from Ricardo Pepi and Folaring Balogun in the Champions League along with Christian Pulisic having a banner sub appearance and another solid outing from Chris Richards made for great headlines, but after that it was lackluster. On the other hand, with it being December, we are now starting to hear transfer rumors. Pulisic has scored a lot of goals and turned in big performances. Pulisic off the bench with the Milan winner in a 3-2 comeback victory from 2-0 down at Torino (he also scored tying goal)! It is probably a good thing that Pulisic is not playing European soccer in the run up to the World Cup. It limits the chances for him to be tired or injured heading into this tournament. When just looking at his time on the field, he's been dominating Serie A. It's just the best American player doing his thing at an elite level for one of the world's most historical teams. It hasn't been a good start to the season for Cole Campbell. He wasn't earning minutes and Borussia Dortmund released him to play for the U.S. team at the U-20 World Cup where he never was able to get going. Now we have a report from HLN in Belgium, which says Campbell is on the verge of moving to Club Brugge which currently sits third in the Belgian First Division. This is likely due to the potential transfer of Christos Tzolis as Brugge is likely to receive very lucrative offers from top clubs for the Greek winger. At this point, any move that gets Campbell on the field is a positive step. The hope is that Club Brugge has a plan for Campbell and rates him. He was scouted at Brugge in recent weeks or months, but Club Brugge recently fired their coach last week and replaced him with Ivan Lecko. Ricardo Pepi continues to make life very hard for PSV manager Peter Bosz. Bosz likely prefers a variety of other options, and PSV has played well this season even without Pepi on the field. But Pepi continues to score at an impressive rate – which he has done ever since joining the club. Then on Wednesday, Pepi scored his third goal in the Champions League this season when he came off the bench to pull one back in what was eventually a 3-2 loss to Atletico. He has a lot of tools and ways to score. Ricardo Pepi scores for PSV today in a 2-0 win over Heerenveen He continues to have an excellent scoring rate for PSV https://t.co/QCh8g9DykN On Tuesday, Folarin Balogun scored in his third straight Champions League game for Monaco when he was in the right place at the right time in a scramble following a 68th minute corner kick. THREE CONSECUTIVE #UCL GAMES WITH A GOAL FOR FOLARIN BALOGUN! Balogun sat out this weekend's 1-0 loss to Brest in Ligue 1 with a minor knock but was able to go 86 minutes against Galatasaray. It is shaping up as an interesting comparison between him and Pepi for the U.S. team. Despite the recent managerial change, U.S. teenage central defender Noahkai Banks continued to start for Augsburg. Next weekend, Augsburg travels to face Eintracht Frankfurt in another tough match. Since then Banks has only continued to play for Augsburg. It hasn't always been great, but he's learning very quickly. If he continues to improve by February, he is in a good position to be the “surprise” pick of the World Cup roster. Regardless, he has a bright future with the United States. You can divide the bad news for American players this past week between injuries and players who didn't play well. The injury list contained many of the usual suspects: Antonee Robinson, Cameron Carter-Vickers, Caleb Wiley, Damion Downs, Rokas Pukstas, Johnny Cardoso, Aidan Morris, -with Tanner Tessman (who missed Lyon's 1-0 loss to Lorient) joining the list this week. Tyler Adams was suspended for Bournemouth's 0-0 draw with Chelsea. On the performance side, things weren't much better. He was held invisible against his former club, Lille, in a 1-0 loss then in the Champions League on Tuesday, he was subbed out at the half of a 3-2 win over Union SG. Yunus Musah managed a cameo for Atalanta on Tuesday when he played the final two minutes of a 2-1 win over Chelsea in the Champions League. He was an unused substitute on Saturday in a 3-1 loss to Hallas Verona. Musah is a good example of why players need to be careful with the moves they make leading into a World Cup year. His lack of minutes will likely cost him a spot on the World Cup team given how well many other central midfielders are playing. Auston Trusty started for Celtic in Wilfried Nancy's debut as coach but Celtic lost 2-1 to surprising leaders Hearts to fall further into second place. Recent U.S. U-21 midfielder Santiago Castaneda was benched for Paderborn and went as an unused sub. John Tolkin and Holstein Kiel are only two points clear of the 2.Bundesliga relegation zone after a 1-1 draw with Eintracht Braunschweig. It is not a good situation for Tolkin and it highlights the dangers of joining a team in the relegation zone midway through the season, as he did last year with Holstien Kiel. Josh Sargent broke his long scoreless skid for Norwich with a goal on Saturday in a 3-2 loss to Watford but was subbed out in the first half on Tuesday in a 1-1 draw with Sheffield United following an aerial challenge. This isn't even an issue involving the U.S. national team. For his own sake, he's beyond being a team sinking to relegation. But here is to hoping he doesn't have another bad injury. James Sands and St. Pauli fell further into the relegation zone following a 1-1 draw with Cologne (where Kristoffer Lund only played the final two minutes. Sands is only at St. Pauli on loan from NYCFC. It is hard to see that option being picked up if they go down. Interesting timing for Boyd to announce such a move has he has five goals in his last four games, including the winning goal on Saturday in a 2-1 victory over Saarbrucken. Waldhof Mannehim now sit seventh and are three points out of the promotional playoff. Danke an das gesamte Team, unseren Fans für die bombastische Stimmung und einen unvergesslichen Tag @svw07 ? Boyd, who turns 35 in February, never scored for the U.S. national team but he was one of the most likeable players in the USMNT pool a decade ago, before serious knee injuries setback his career. Here's to hoping he goes out playing great soccer in a promotion race. Unfortunately, he also had an assist for Napoli in a mistake that led to the host's winning goal. Aside from those two moments – good and bad - , it was a quiet game. Lovely assist by #USMNT's Weston McKennie helps pull Juventus level in Naples. Brenden Aaronson played the final 25 minutes for Leeds United in a 3-3 draw with Liverpool and Leeds scored all three goals after he came into the game. It doesn't always work out, but Aaronson's energy can be contagious at times. Leeds is now two points clear of the relegation zone. Chris Richards started and was once again quality in a 2-1 away win over Fulham. He is in the best spot for a defender right now, consistently good. He should win U.S. Soccer's Male Player of the Year for 2025. Haji Wright returned from injury on Tuesday when he started for Coventry in a 1-1 draw with Preston North End. It was a disappointing result for Coventry, but they still sit comfortably atop the Championship table. But it was welcome news to see Wright back. It was good for him to build up stamina and take another step forward. Both players are on the bubble of the USMNT right now, but this game was a small step forward for that. It was the best game Westerlo have had in a long time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. men's national team forward Folarin Balogun led Monaco to a 1–0 victory over Galatasaray on Tuesday night, sealing his name in the Champions League record books along the way. The 24-year-old became the first USMNT player in history to score in three consecutive Champions League games. Balogun found the back of the net against Bodø/Glimt, Pafos and now Galatasaray to achieve a feat not even Christian Pulisic ever managed. The goal was nothing remarkable from the American at Monaco's Stade Louis II, but it was enough to secure all three points for the French outfit. Galatasaray keeper Günay Güvenç failed to deal with a dangerous inswinging corner, giving Balogun the opening to guide home the game's only goal. 3 goals in the last 3 Champions League matches. Balogun has now scored six goals in his last seven appearances for club and country. The 2026 FIFA World Cup is only six months away, and the USMNT will need Balogun at his best if the Stars and Stripes want to make a run on home soil next summer. Mauricio Pochettino's side landed a favorable Group D draw, where they will take on Australia, Paraguay and the winner of UEFA Playoff C. In his absence, Haji Wright, Patrick Agyemang and Ricardo Pepi all took turns logging minutes up top under Pochettino. Agyemang scored two goals at last summer's Gold Cup, but ultimately failed to impress.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Our expert offers his best Real Madrid vs Man City Predictions, Lineups, Odds & Tips for this Champions League encounter at the Santiago Bernabeu today (10/12/2025) While they've been heavily dependent on Erling Haaland for goals this term, more players are now starting to contribute. Haaland has only scored one of the last 14 City goals in all competitions. By contrast, Real Madrid are still heavily reliant on Kylian Mbappe for attacking inspiration. In their last four matches, the Frenchman has either scored or assisted all eight of Real Madrid's goals. Alonso came with dreams of constructing a brilliant team, but there is no clear playing style emerging. There are defensive flaws too, with at least 1.0 xG allowed in six of their last seven games. That suggests Man City offer value here, with no clear favourite for this clash. Like many of his teammates, the English midfielder endured a difficult 2024/25 season. He has also scored twice previously against Real Madrid, including a quarter-final strike at the Bernabeu in 2024. Based on current form, Foden is good value to score anytime with an implied probability of 35.7%. Real Madrid's defensive selection issues further suggest City could come out on top. The hosts suffered a huge setback on Sunday, with Eder Militao limping off against Celta Vigo. The Brazilian has been their most convincing centre-back this term, but he is now out until March. Full-backs Dani Carvajal, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ferland Mendy are also out injured. David Alaba and Dean Huijsen are additional doubts heading into this fixture. It was a similar scenario when they travelled to take on Olympiacos in their last Champions League match. They left too much space on that occasion and conceded three goals. They could be worth backing to score over 1.5 goals with an implied probability of 54.1%. Real Madrid suffered a shock 2-0 defeat at home to Celta Vigo in La Liga on Sunday. Manchester City have won three on the bounce heading into this clash, facing rivals competing for a top-eight finish. However, they did lose their last Champions League match 2-0 at home to Bayer Leverkusen. After winning three of their opening five European fixtures, Pep Guardiola's side are currently on 10 points. Real Madrid expected lineup: Courtois, Carreras, Asencio, Rudiger, Valverde, Tchouameni, Guler, Bellingham, Ceballos, Vinicius, Mbappe Manchester City expected lineup: Donnarumma, Nunes, Dias, Gvardiol, O'Reilly, Gonzalez, Cherki, Reijnders, Foden, Doku, Haaland</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The final round of group fixtures in Qatar produced immense drama, but with third-place qualifiers, USA, Canada and Mexico risks an underwhelming finale, but Miguel Delaney considers a simple solution Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. For all the absurd political theatre around the World Cup 2026 draw, there was still a sense of “magic” – as Scotland manager Steve Clark put it – as countries began to visualise the tournament. It used to be like this with the Champions League, but nobody would really say the competition has any sense of magic during this opening stage. Tottenham Hotspur beat Slavia Prague on Tuesday night to go up a few places, but does that really matter? The Champions League group stage has become classic football as content rather than pure competitive sport, as has been discussed on these pages before. A concern with the 2026 World Cup is that the expansion to 48 teams starts to move it towards this. And this isn't one of those unfair jibes about Uzbekistan against possible play-off qualifiers DR Congo. It's that Portugal against Colombia, in the same group, just doesn't have the same sense of peril. It's simply a fundamental fact that group games will have inherently less tension because of the need to allow eight third-place sides through. And including third-place teams from four-team groups just never works as well. There will be many people reading this and no doubt yelling that this was exactly the format in 1986, 1990 and 1994, which happen to be among the most cherished World Cups of all. For one, there was a smaller 24-team field in those World Cups, bringing more competitive tension. The unfair and uneven imbalance towards more developed European and South American teams also ensured a higher baseline of quality. Secondly, two qualifying from four simply works much better. In 2022, most famously, Argentina lost their first match and were immediately under immense pressure to win the next two, which they did. It's instantly visible that there just aren't the same stakes. A typical irony is that Gianni Infantino and Fifa recognised some of this at the last World Cup. The Fifa president announced that the 2026 World Cup would not go through with an original idea of three-team groups, because 2022 had shown how electric four-team groups are. Every single one of them went to the wire, with most of them requiring teams to watch what was happening in the other game. Is it not something that any football fan just realises? And, just as typically, Fifa came up with the wrong solution. Allowing third-place teams, especially when an expansion dilutes quality, also dilutes the drama that so moved Infantino in 2022. In order to keep the exquisite tension of two teams going through from four – 48 into 24 – why not just allow the eight best group winners to go straight into the last 16, with a play-off in between? Even the issue of first-placed teams fielding weakened sides for final group games when opposition still have qualification on the line would be solved, since they would have the incentive of finishing in the top eight of 12 group winners. And while one argument is that a mezzanine play-off round may create too long of a wait between games for the best teams, that is no longer as relevant in this calendar. By contrast, a longer mid-tournament break would probably be even more of an incentive, as fatigue takes hold. Extending this out to seven or eight is hardly a sufficient negative amid the many positives. The actual World Cup calendar could also just be a bit more smartly scheduled. And if anyone quibbles about the eventual champions only playing seven games rather than the maximum of eight… well, does that actually matter? Above anything, a bit more of the old magic would be preserved. Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Glitzy draws, OJ-era chaos, grass laid over AstroTurf and a host nation that barely cared – the 1994 World Cup arrived amid suspicion and slapstick. Yet it became a watershed that would alter US sport and global football politics alike But there was also hostility in the United States. “Hating soccer,” wrote the columnist Tom Weir, “is more American than mom's apple pie, driving a pickup or spending Saturday afternoon channel surfing with the remote control.” Foreign skeptics perhaps feared too much growth in the United States and possible domination of the global game; American skeptics worried what a soccer boom might mean for the four major US sports. Fifa just hoped there was money to be made. What nobody doubted was that the United States would bring glitz, glamour, and razzmatazz. The draw was held in Las Vegas and starred such luminaries as Bill Clinton, Faye Dunaway, Jeff Bridges, and Jessica Lange. The opening ceremony, staged at Soldier Field in Chicago before the defending champion Germany – playing at a World Cup as a unified nation for the first time since 1938 – faced Bolivia, was a lavish, sun-drenched affair presented by Oprah Winfrey and featuring turns by Diana Ross, Daryl Hall, and The B-52's. Winfrey fell off the stage and twisted her ankle. Ross dragged a shot wide of an open goal from three yards. The United States had been awarded hosting rights, appropriately enough, on 4 July 1988. Chile had withdrawn from the race and Brazil had still not installed Havelange's son-in-law, Ricardo Teixeira, as CBF president, which effectively left a straight fight between the United States and Morocco. It was a close-run thing, the United States winning out by 10 votes to Morocco's seven, with Brazil on two. Had the ban Mexico received from the 1990 World Cup for fielding overage players in a youth tournament been an attempt to smooth the USA's passage to 1994 by giving them tournament experience? Havelange was certain the United States was a market ripe for exploitation, but even though Fifa talked boldly of hosting the World Cup as a way of stimulating interest in the game, there were plenty of doubters. More broadly, what did prioritizing potential commercial markets over traditional soccer countries suggest about the way the game was going? The Italian president of Uefa, Artemio Franchi, had been clear he could “never agree to a World Cup for multinationals” and he wasn't the only one who disliked the overtly commercial route soccer was taking under Havelange. He was killed in a car crash in 1983 and there were enough unexplained details about his death to prompt an investigation by the journalist Alberto Ballarin, who identified two untraced foreign motorcyclists as potential suspects in a possible murder. Like Colombia, Italy played with a back four and zonal marking, adapting the tenets of Total Football for their own market. Arrigo Sacchi had been a shoe salesman for his father's factory when, in 1979, aged 33, he quit to devote himself fulltime to coaching. His big break came in the 1986–87 Coppa Italia, when his Parma team, then in Serie B, beat AC Milan, which had just been acquired by Silvio Berlusconi. Berlusconi saw in Sacchi something of himself, a disruptor unbound by convention. Appointing Sacchi was an extraordinary risk, but one rapidly justified when Milan won the league in Sacchi's first season and followed up with a pair of European Cups. Like many who plan meticulously, Sacchi was extremely superstitious. What followed was, to Sacchi's mind, typical: a classic Jack Charlton victory. At Giants Stadium on the East Coast, two early goals from Roberto Baggio effectively secured Italy's win over Bulgaria. But the 2,700-mile journey cost Italy a day of preparation, which Sacchi thought decisive. In the second semi-final, Thomas Ravelli had already made a couple of fine saves before Sweden's captain Jonas Thern was sent off for a studs-up jab on Dunga's ankle. Baresi made a miraculous recovery from his knee injury to start, but it wasn't enough. Although Sacchi said that “in the defensive phase, we played very well,” he thought they were “mediocre” going forward, for which he blamed fatigue. The game was anxious and drab, ignited only after Viola had come on for Zinho with fourteen minutes of extra time remaining. It finished 0–0 and so, for the first time, a World Cup was settled on penalties. Roberto Baggio didn't want to go first, so Baresi took responsibility and put his kick over the bar. Marcio Santos and Daniele Massaro both had their efforts saved, which meant that when Baggio stepped up to take Italy's fifth kick, he had to score. He, too, shot over and Brazil had their fourth World Cup. When customs officials at the airport in Recife tried to get them to pay import tax on goods they'd bought in the United States, the result was a five-hour standoff that was ended only when the finance minister waved them through. A subsequent poll, though, showed that 70% of Brazilians thought they should have paid the duty; players were not the national heroes they had once been.</p>

England head coach Thomas Tuchel believes his side will benefit from facing high-ranked opponents in Uruguay and Japan during the March international break.

The Three Lions will face Uruguay on March 27 before hosting Japan four days later, with both friendlies taking place at Wembley Stadium.

Both opponents qualified for the 2026 World Cup next summer, with Uruguay currently 16th in the FIFA men's rankings, two spots ahead of Japan.

Tuchel was not only happy with the level of the countries they are set to face, but also their location.

"We are really pleased to have these two fixtures confirmed as our World Cup year takes shape," said Tuchel.

"We wanted to play two teams ranked in the top 20 in the world, but also to test ourselves against opponents from outside of Europe."

England were drawn into Group L at the 2026 World Cup alongside Croatia, Ghana and Panama, who they also faced in the 2018 group stage.

Their match against Japan will be their final game before Tuchel names his squad for the tournament, but the Three Lions are expected to play two further warm-up games in the United States prior to their opening fixture against Croatia on June 17.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Pride flag is waved at Lumen Field, the 2026 World Cup venue in Seattle Steph Chambers/Getty Images Indeed, the body had even designated a specific ‘Pride Match' to take place during Pride Weekend, with a World Cup game slated to take place at Seattle's Lumen Field on Friday, June 26. Yet after Saturday, when the group-stage fixture schedule was confirmed, the Seattle committee encountered an awkward predicament: their Pride Match would be Egypt vs Iran, which would mean a celebration of the LGBTQ+ community as shoulder programming for a game involving two nations that criminalize same-sex relations. This has triggered a backlash from the soccer federations of Egypt and Iran, both of whom immediately sought to halt any link to Pride events. At previous men's World Cups, world football/soccer governing body FIFA used a more traditional model of a single local/national organizing committee for the host nations concerned, such as Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy for the previous edition in 2022. This allows FIFA, which has set up offices in Miami, Florida, and New York City, to maximise the commercial benefits of the tournament. There is very little revenue sharing, with FIFA taking all the income from ticketing, broadcast deals, in-stadium sponsorship, and even parking fees. Yet within that model, FIFA has still allowed for each city staging matches to have its own host committee. It means each of the 16 cities can drum up local sponsorship and arrange programming around the games to produce economic impact for its region. Firstly, it says that as a not-for-profit organization, SeattleFWC26 is “working to deliver a safe, sustainable, and accessible FWC that meets our region's values”. As part of this objective, it says Seattle and the wider Washington State area “value diversity and celebrate the many cultures and communities that make this a special place to live”. As part of the Seattle committee's inclusive aims, its website says it established a committee that will plan and execute initiatives relating to the Pride Match. This was scheduled to take place during Pride Weekend in June and had been in the works long before the draw. They are Jen Barnes, the founder of Rough & Tumble (a pub which emphasizes screenings of women's sport), and Louise Chernin, who was CEO of the Greater Seattle Business Association between 2002 and 2020. It adds that the committee will provide “strategic advice and validate community-informed priorities”, “curate Pride stories and economic opportunities for LGBTQIA+-owned enterprises”,  as well as “shape communications, community activations, and cultural programming”. The website also says it intends to mark the United States playing their second group game of the tournament at Lumen Field (which will be officially referred to as Seattle Stadium during the tournament, due to its sponsored everyday title) on Juneteenth against Australia. Juneteenth — Friday, June 19 — is a federal holiday commemorating the official end of slavery in the United States on that date in 1865. The website says: “Having the U.S. team playing in Seattle on Juneteenth creates a high-visibility, high-responsibility moment to introduce hundreds of millions of viewers worldwide to Juneteenth and to create benefit for local Black-owned businesses and arts and cultural organizations. The artwork will be incorporated into a citywide celebration and, it adds, will be a “lasting symbol of Seattle's commitment to inclusion and pride”. A spanner was thrown into the works when the group-stage draw and subsequent match schedule emerged over the past week, with Egypt's Group G finale against Iran down to be played in Seattle on Friday, June 26 (in the early hours of June 27, European time). The Human Dignity Trust says the Iranian state criminalizes gay people, as well as same-sex sexual activity, and ultimately imposes a maximum penalty of death under its penal code. It also says Egypt prohibits same-sex sexual activity, with provisions for prison sentences and fines. In addition to Egypt and Iran, other World Cup-qualified nations with the same stance include Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Ghana, and Senegal. The association added it has sent an official letter to FIFA secretary general Mattias Grafstrom to say it had been made aware of the local committee's planning to hold “some activities related to supporting homosexuality during that match, and that they (Egyptian FA) completely refuse these activities, which directly contradicts with the cultural, religious and social values in the region, especially in the Arabic and Islamic communities”. The Egyptians warned that such activities “could cause cultural and religious sensitivity between the attending fans of both countries” and must be avoided in order to maintain “the spirit of unity and peace”. They also noted that FIFA's statutes say it ought to remain neutral in political matters and that it should not promote issues the Egyptian FA deems to be “sensitive or divisive”. The Iranian Football Federation also appears to have pushed back. Al Jazeera reports that the federation's president, Mehdi Taj, told local news agency ISNA both his country and Egypt had raised “objections against the issue”. He described it as “an irrational move that supports a certain group”. FIFA is not formally commenting on the matter at this stage, but multiple people familiar with the situation, all of whom wished to remain anonymous as they were not authorized to speak publicly on it, indicated that the body's central headquarters has no role in the Pride initiative. They also said that nothing has been planned within the stadium itself for matchday. The local host committees do not have the power or scope to impose initiatives inside tournament venues, as all World Cup programming is led by FIFA's central HQ. The broad-brush description of a Pride Match, widely reported by global media, appears to have given the impression there would be an organized Pride feature in Lumen Field, but that was not the case. FIFA allows individual supporters to wear Pride colours or demonstrate representation for the cause within their venues, and it is possible locals who attend the game may wish to do so on a Pride weekend. On Tuesday, the Seattle committee showed no signs of backing down. SeattleFWC26 is moving forward as planned with our community programming outside the stadium during Pride weekend and throughout the tournament, partnering with LGBTQ+ leaders, artists, and business owners to elevate existing Pride celebrations across (the state of) Washington. “Football has a unique power to unite people across borders, cultures, and beliefs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is now clear that Lionel Messi, one of the greatest players in soccer history, will be headed to Kansas City with his defending world champion Argentina national team for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Of course, he and all World Cup athletes have places to stay. The question now is who among soccer's legion of fans — some 650,000 are expected — will nab a room in Kansas City as hotels are filling up. Room prices on short-term rental sites like Airbnb, Vrbo, Orbitz and others are climbing at the speed of a Messi free kick. The tournament in Kansas City runs from June 11 to July 19, with four of six matches at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium already scheduled. A quick check of Kansas City hotels during that month-long period shows the demand: The Westin Crown Center Hotel — sold out, a reservation representative said. The Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center — sold out. The Marriott Kansas City Overland Park — sold out. The Hotel Phillips Kansas City, Curio Collection by Hilton, $637 a night. Drury Inn & Suites in Independence, which in May is at $148 a night, is at $506 during the first week of the World Cup. The prices of short-term rentals listed on platforms such as Airbnb, Vrbo, Orbitz and others have likewise skyrocketed. One host, identified at Kristen Doppelt of the company Cozy in KC, lists a three-bedroom “villa” with pool that normally rents for about $450 per night for just over $20,341 per night in the first week of the World Cup. The Star reached out to Doppelt on Tuesday by phone, email and over a rental platform, but did not receive a response. As the tournament approaches, some Kansas Citians have raised concerns over the condition of some short-term rentals, price-gouging, or, at the very least, offering subpar properties for premium prices. While prices are quickly rising, not all have skyrocketed, depending on one's definition. A four-bedroom house on Oak Street, just south of Brookside, rated “Exceptional” on Vrbo with reviews of 10 out of 10 by nearly every renter, was still available Tuesday for $1,165 a night. Bargains, to a degree, can still be found. Even with 650,000 visitors expected, Devin Aaron, a spokesperson for Visit KC, Kansas City's conventions and visitors bureau, is confident that enough rooms will be available. “I think a good thing to keep in mind is that the 650,000 people won't be here all at once,” Aaron said. I know everyone keeps seeing that number and thinking, ‘Oh, we don't have enough space.' Aaron said that in bidding for the World Cup, Kansas City had to prove to FIFA officials that the city had a sufficient number of hotels and other rooms to host an international event of such scale. “Looking at hotel rooms in teh Kansas City metro, looking out at those other neighborhoods in Overland Park, and Leawood, Bonner Springs and things like that, we are more than confident that there is going to be more than enough housing to go around,” she said. “Especially if people are looking at places further afield, like a St. Joe, which is an easy commute. There will be more than enough for all the demand that we'll have.” More short-term rentals are likely to come online soon, as people register. “It's always better to do sooner than later,” Aaron said. Sooner rather than later is probably their best bet.” This story was originally published December 10, 2025 at 6:06 AM.</p>

Find this story in your account's ‘Saved for Later' section. (FIFA president Gianni Infantino gave Donald Trump a “FIFA Peace Prize” that he accepted with legitimate joy and appreciation in a way that gets more disturbing the more you think about it.) Every time I think about it, I find myself tapping the right side of my head with my palm like I'm trying to get water out of my ear. In terms of our national teams, there is no squad more reliably dramatic than the U.S. men's soccer. I have been writing about the pending breakthrough of the U.S. men's team for this magazine for more than a decade now, and the team has rewarded me by persistently falling on its face. It's fired multiple coaches, restructured their entire operation, and had players fighting with their coaches (including star Christian Pulisic and current coach Mauricio Pochettino), and, worst of fall, it imploded by missing the 2018 World Cup entirely, unquestionably U.S. soccer's nadir at the exact moment it was supposed to making its big leap forward. (The most recent disaster was being bonked from the 2024 Copa America at the exact same moment, just a few miles away in Atlanta, that Joe Biden was having his own debacle on a CNN debate stage.) You can always count on U.S. soccer to break your heart. That is why the draw last Friday caused equal parts excitement and anxiety. The U.S. could have ended up facing powers such as Morocco, Switzerland, or Norway (led by Premier League stars Erling Haaland and Martin Ødegaard) in its group: Instead, it got relative weaklings Australia and Paraguay. The United States is heavily favored to win its group, something it has only done once, back in 2010. “This is about as favorable of a group as the U.S. could have hoped for,” wrote ESPN's Bill Connelly. This is happening at the same time that the U.S. team has been playing better than it has in years, and for good reason. Pochettino, formerly the coach for the Tottenham Hotspurs, has made some strategic adjustments and embraced what he calls “organized chaos,” leading to some eye-opening wins, including a stunner of a 5-1 blowout against Uruguay last month. Pochettino also seems to have won his staring contest with Pulisic: He lambasted Pulisic for skipping out on the Gold Cup, and Pulisic fired back at him, but now everything is simpatico, thanks largely to Pochettino's making tactical adjustments that benefitted the way Pulisic likes to play. That's particularly valuable because this is unquestionably the most talented roster ever, with more international players playing in the top leagues than anyone could have imagined even a decade ago. It has been a rocky ride to get there, to say the least, but it looks like the stars are aligning. This is of course a reason to be more scared, not less: We have all been excited before. But there is something weirdly perverse about USMNT having everything lay out perfectly for them at the exact moment that the U.S. and its president are set to humiliate themselves in front of the entire world. Infantino and FIFA have made Trump — who continues to threaten to pull the cup out of “blue cities” — the centerpiece of the biggest sporting event on earth, and we're going to have to deal with that all next summer. It is a little ominous that the notoriously combustible, self-destructing USMNT feels comparatively stable and reliable.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>December 10 – Match ticket prices for the World Cup took off like a rocket the moment the draw and schedule dropped, thanks to FIFA's newest gift to world football, namely, dynamic pricing. At some point you have to wonder when fans will finally push back. Before matchups were announced, you could get into the June 27 game in Miami's Hard Rock Stadium for under $400. Brazil versus Scotland in the same stadium saw a sharp rise, and the holders, Argentina's three group matches, weren't far behind. The bigger story is how normalised FIFA is trying to make these increases, saying it doesn't control the secondary market, but its own ticketing strategy has embraced scarcity and surge logic. You only need to look at the FIFA Club World Cup earlier this year to see the trend. Prices climbed fast there too, especially for games involving big European clubs, and many fans felt squeezed. But if FIFA continues leaning into this model, and prices keep behaving like stocks after a good earnings call, it's fair to expect a backlash eventually. The 10 biggest group-stage increases from Thursday to Sunday afternoon were as follows…Wall Street could only look in wonder and wish!

A major event for American soccer fans will take place in the Tri-Counties. 

The U.S. Women's National Soccer Team will play Chile on January 27 at UC Santa Barbara's Harder Stadium.

The U.S. team is the most successful in the history of international women's soccer, having won four FIFA championships and five Olympic gold medals.

The U.S. team will train in January at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, which is home to the LA Galaxy Major League Soccer franchise.

Presale tickets for the Harder Stadium match go on sale at 10 a.m. Wednesday, and public sales begin Friday morning.

The match against Chile may be an exhibition, but it will get significant media coverage. TBS and HBO Max will televise it live, and the Westwood One Radio Network will present it on the radio.

The U.S. women's team trained at UCSB in 1991 and 2019, and at Westmont College in 2023.

While the FIFA Men's World Cup includes matches in the United States next year, the FIFA U20 Women's World Cup will take place next September in Poland.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Visit Santa Barbara, UCSB Collaborate to Host International Match Between U.S. and Chile on January 27 Visit Santa Barbara helped coordinate with the U.S. Women's National Team to bring an elite game to South Coast soccer fans and attract visiting sports fans to attend the game and spend time in the area's hotels, restaurants, and shops. “We are thrilled to welcome the U.S. Women's National Team to UCSB for their match against Chile in January,” said Visit Santa Barbara South Coast President and CEO Kathy Janega-Dykes. Sports tourism plays a vital role in that effort, especially during the shoulder season, when this exciting match takes place.” “One of the goals of U.S. Soccer is to take our National Teams to new markets around the country, and I applaud that,” said U.S. head coach Emma Hayes. “Playing in a city for the first time is not a common occurrence at this point in our history so I know our players will enjoy being in beautiful Santa Barbara and our staff are really looking forward to January camp and these matches against two tough South American countries. This is the start of an important year for our team and as always, we're focused on maximizing every minute we get with the players.” The U.S. Men's National Team has played an international match at Harder Stadium once, in 1993, where the U.S. men's team played a 1-1 draw against Romania in front of a crowd of more than 9,000. Tickets will be available for the public after 10 a.m. on December 12. Please note this login is to submit events or press releases.
