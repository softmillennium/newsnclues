                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Suppose you've ever felt that familiar shiver watching late-night reruns of The X-Files. Today feels a little bit like coming full circle. The CIA has quietly released hundreds of declassified documents, some dating back to the late 1940s and early 1950s, detailing investigations into unidentified flying objects. This was the same era when the U.S. Air Force recorded over 12,000 UFO sightings as part of Project Blue Book, and more than 700 of them stubbornly remained unsolved. Seems the CIA was paying very close attention, too. To make things extra fun, the Agency even highlighted a list of documents they claimed Agent Fox Mulder would love, along with another set perfect for Agent Dana Scully, as if they were curating evidence for both the believer and the skeptic. Below are two of the most fascinating cases from those files. A man named Oscar Linke, traveling with his 11-year-old daughter near the town of Hasselbach, pulled over after a flat tire. At first, Linke assumed it was wildlife, maybe deer. But as they walked closer, he realized it was something far stranger. They stumbled upon two figures standing next to what he described as a massive, round object, something he could only compare to an enormous frying pan, measuring roughly 42 to 49 feet across. Around the rim were two neat rows of circular openings, and a tall cone-like structure rose from the top. When Linke's daughter called out, the two figures hurried inside. One, he said, had a glowing bump on his chest that shifted from green to red. Moments later, flames shot out from beneath the craft, it lifted off, tilted horizontally, and shot away beyond the treetops. Two glowing discs were said to be hovering above a major uranium mining region. Witnesses described the objects gliding in smooth, sweeping curves, shifting shape depending on the angle, sometimes looking like plates, sometimes like oval discs, and sometimes nothing more than thin lines streaking through the sky. A fighter pilot, Commander Pierre, attempted to chase them down. He gave up after 15 minutes, estimating the discs were flying at speeds of nearly 932 mph. He said they were metallic, somewhere between 39 and 49 feet wide, with a central knob that remained perfectly still while the outer ring spun at incredible speed. The aircraft could move vertically, horizontally, and drop down close to the treetops, moves that would've crushed or cooked any human pilot inside. Pierre was convinced no person could have survived the violent rotations and heat. The CIA's release didn't end with old reports. They raise questions, big ones, about what exactly the world's governments have seen, studied, or quietly wondered about for decades. And why, after so many years, do these sightings still sound like something out of our wildest imaginations? Writing stories that blend fiction and history, exploring the past with a touch of imagination. There are no comments for this story So, let's be honest, when someone says “giant,” most of us immediately picture Goliath, Jack and the Beanstalk, or that iconic Stay Puft Marshmallow Man (simultaneously terrifying and delicious). But in the real world, there's been a surprising amount of speculation that an actual race of giant humans once walked the Earth, maybe even living alongside early humans. Veterans Day is always observed on November 11. Have you ever wondered why November 11 is the date to honor veterans? There is a very good reason for that particular date. Mindset is one of those words we hear everywhere—from motivational speeches to business books—but few people actually understand how to use it, not just talk about it. When used correctly, your mindset becomes an internal compass—quiet, steady, and incredibly powerful. By Fred Bradfordabout an hour ago in FYI</p>

Erika Kirk spoke publicly for the first time about the conspiracy theories surrounding the death of her husband, conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, denouncing any speculation as hurtful and unfounded during an interview on Fox News Channel's “Outnumbered.”

Kirk said she would “never back down” in defending her family and her late husband's legacy. She said she wants space to grieve with her children and protect her husband's resting place, adding that her silence in the face of conspiracy theories should not be mistaken for complicity. She added that the speculation has hurt the people closest to her and insisted she is “done” allowing unfounded claims to go unchallenged.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Radiation causes subsurface chemical reactions, which could act as “food” for some lifeforms. Some scientists believe life could be hiding in our own solar system. After all, Earth has a stable rotation, the perfect cocktail of atmospheric gases, and crucially, a strong magnetic field that keeps solar radiation from completely frying us. Turns out, new research suggests that conditions we humans would consider far-from-perfect may actually power interstellar life, meaning the search for extraterrestrials just got a whole lot bigger—and scientists might have already seen success. A paper published in the International Journal of Astrobiology this past July suggests that high-energy particle clusters, called galactic cosmic rays, that fly through space could sustain life on extraterrestrial worlds. These rays emit radiation that can trigger chemical reactions—a process known as radiolysis—which in turn causes molecules to break down and release byproducts that may serve as fuel for living things. 🔮 Check Out Our New Video Series, Pop Mech Explains: PrecognitionYou've probably had that eerie feeling before—knowing what's about to happen before it actually does. A text from someone you were just thinking about. To understand how many theoretical cells galactic cosmic rays could support, the team simulated cosmic rays breaking down water molecules at different depths on each world. The team modeled the simulation after our current understanding of extremophiles, a type of organism on Earth which thrive in extreme environments. For instance, scientists understand that a bacterium called Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator gets energy from “eating” the radioactive decay of uranium. On Earth, some of these radiation-resistant extremophiles hide underground to avoid the brunt of the radiation—like how humans would hide away in a fallout shelter—which is why researchers tested on subsurface conditions. The research team predicts that the moon is capable of supporting as many as 42,900 cells per cubic centimeter at a depth of two feet, Mars can support 11,600 cells at just over half a meter below the surface, and Europa can support 4,200 cells at one meter deep. The theoretical life on these worlds would be neither walking, talking green aliens nor a flourishing ecosystem. Instead, we would likely see early forms of life, like microbes, because there is just enough energy to keep basic organisms afloat. Worlds that we would have otherwise thought uninhabitable—either because they did not lie within their star's habitable zone, or because they didn't orbit a star at all—could now be viable places to search for life. Published in the journal Nature Astronomy this October, another recent study found organic compounds in ice samples from Enceladus' frozen surface, renewing hope that the moon's oceans hold life. During a close fly-by in 2008, Enceladus ejected the ice fragments from its surface, and Cassini, an unmanned spacecraft, collected them for analysis. The team's analysis revealed that Enceladus is emitting more carbon-based substances than previously thought, meaning life isn't necessarily there, but the ingredients for it certainly are. Still, finding cells elsewhere in our solar system would prove something revolutionary: life isn't just a random, one-time occurrence—it's likely all across the universe.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LOS ANGELES, CA - JANUARY 29: Producer Jason Blum attends the Film Independent's Spirit Awards screening of 'Paranormal Activity' at Regal 14 at LA Live Downtown on January 29, 2010 in Los Angeles, California. Paramount Pictures has agreed to co-finance, co-produce, and distribute the eventual feature. “I've been a huge admirer of Paranormal Activity since the brilliant first movie, with its creeping slow burn and subtle ability to make the unseen terrifying," Wan said in a statement to THR. "I'm looking forward to expanding on its legacy and helping shape the next evolution of this scary found-footage franchise." “Diving in with James for this exciting rebirth of the franchise that started it all for Blumhouse is exactly what we dreamed of when we merged with Atomic Monster. I'll be actively involved with him to introduce this new chapter. We look forward to partnering with Josh Greenstein, Dana Goldberg, David Ellison, Jeff Shell and their teams at Paramount as we bring Paranormal Activity back to life.” Ironically, Blum seemed to have exhausted all personal interest in the IP just three years ago when he said, “It has been enough already. He went on to clarify his statement with, "It would come back if some director I love, like Scott Derrickson, said: 'I have a great idea for a Paranormal Activity movie.' The success of Paranormal Activity launched an entire series that currently spans seven titles, which have grossed a cumulative $890 million globally. The most recent sequel, subtitled Next of Kin and written by Christopher Landon (Happy Death Day, Freaky), received a straight-to-streaming debut on Paramount+ in 2021. “We're thrilled to reignite the iconic Paranormal Activity franchise with two of the horror genre's most visionary talents, James and Jason,” said Paramount Pictures co-chairs Josh Greenstein and Dana Goldberg. "Jason's role in shaping this franchise into a global cultural touchstone, together with James' singular taste and track record for innovative storytelling, sets the stage for a thrilling new chapter."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk has reignited the long-running debate over UFOs, telling Tucker Carlson that most sightings are not evidence of extraterrestrial visitors but are far more likely linked to classified US military technology. Instead, he has doubled down on his belief that while unidentified objects exist, they almost certainly originate from Earth, not outer space. His comments arrive as US government assessments also lean heavily toward terrestrial explanations for the unexplained phenomena. Instead, he claimed they are 'probably' linked to secret US weapons and aircraft programmes. Elon Musk says he has seen no evidence that aliens exist and has asked senior members of the SpaceX team about it, all of whom say they have never seen any.He suggests that many UFO sightings could simply be advanced weapons programs by the United States government. Speaking to Carlson, Musk said many UFO reports involve actual objects but insisted none resemble extraterrestrial craft. Musk also pointed to his vantage point as head of SpaceX, which operates the Starlink satellite network. He said the company has 'roughly 6,000 satellites' orbiting Earth, yet 'not once have we had to manoeuvre around an alien spacecraft.' The same report said many incidents involved balloons, drones, birds or commercial satellites. Musk's position draws attention partly because of his companies' proximity to US defence and intelligence programmes. SpaceX is working on specialised satellites for American intelligence agencies under its Starshield division. Witnesses in some high-profile cases have reported craft displaying movements that appear to defy known aeronautical capabilities, including extreme acceleration and abrupt directional changes. Meanwhile, proponents of alien hypotheses cite claims such as those made by whistleblower David Grusch, who alleged that the US government is hiding retrieved non-human craft. However, AARO and other agencies have reiterated that no materials or data support those allegations. With growing political pressure for greater transparency around UAP investigations, public interest remains high. Musk's comments ensure the debate will continue, especially if SpaceX or government agencies release further findings. For now, the official position remains that while many sightings require further study, there is still no confirmed evidence of extraterrestrial life behind UFO reports.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lue Elizondo, former Pentagon officer and UAP whistleblower, has sent a memo to President Trump urging action on UAPs, warning that these unexplained aerial technologies could pose not only physical but cybersecurity threats to national security. All it's going to do is erode the faith and confidence of the American people, because people know it's real,” Elizondo said. He told NewsNation's Reality Check with Ross Coulthart that he has heard several Congress members have had their own UAP experiences and are “very concerned about the topic.” Elizondo, the former director of the Pentagon's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), has proposed establishing a “UAP czar” to help centralize operations and provide accountability. And he even goes as far as to say that we could find ourselves in a frightful situation should we continue to sweep the issue under the carpet. “We're going to be in another really bad situation… an event that is going to potentially eclipse the impact if 9/11 had on our society.” Far from claiming that aliens will attack a la Independence Day, Elizondo is showing that the strategic implications of UAP technology falling into the wrong hands are massive. A “nightmare scenario” would emerge in the form of a rebellious upstart with catastrophic deviations: “Imagine some rogue nation… exploiting and reverse engineering capabilities associated with UAP. UAP-like tech could enable surprise attacks or airspace dominance, and while one can get perplexed as to why the US dominates the UFO chronicles, Elizondo counters by suggesting a belligerent regime letting loose. “Imagine some rogue nation like North Korea having the ability to exploit and reverse engineer just even some of the capabilities that we see now associated with UAP.” If UAP tech does indeed represent next-generation weaponry, then the acceleration could exceed conventional physics and reach a level of performance beyond what human-made drones can achieve. With cybersecurity getting whacked left, right, and center here on Earth, national security vulnerabilities could be exposed at the highest level. “This is not going away… it's a matter of time before some state or non-state actor figures out a way to utilize technology against us, to weaponize it,” said Elizondo. Developers without admin privileges or attackers with limited access can bankrupt smaller companies simply by raising Cursor and AWS Bedrock spending limits, a report by OX Security has revealed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Felicia Day‘s Charlie Bradbury appeared in only 11 episodes of Supernatural over a number of a years: seven in the show's world as a quirky lesbian hacker genius and four as her Apocalypse World alter ego, an accomplished demon hunter, who also liked girls. Nonetheless, the sci fi/fantasy/web content creator stalwart was popular enough that many fans asked that Day become a cast regular. It helped that Charlie was almost considered a Winchester family member, and a particular favorite of Dean's (Jensen Ackles) — in both universes. Day was interviewed in May at a Creation Entertainment convention in New Jersey for TV Guide Magazine's Supernatural Afterlife: 20th Anniversary Special celebrating the iconic sci-fi show, where she shared her thoughts about both her love of SPN conventions around the world and her role on the iconic show. What draws you back to the many Supernatural conventions? Felicia Day: I started my career as a potential slayer on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so I was introduced to conventions and fan families very early. It feels like when your content means more to someone than just like passively entertaining them, it gives an extra level of fulfillment to an artist. At the SPN conventions, what do your fans generally say to you? I think what's wonderful about my character Charlie it that inspired a lot of people to either go into tech, come out to their parents, and be more confident as sort of a weird woman. Those kind of roles don't come along all the time. Charlie's an out-sized character; in the genre universe, I don't see a lot of characters like her even today on TV and I think that kind of resonates. I've read on some fans sites that they really accepted Charlie, particularly because she wasn't going to be romantically involved with either of the Winchesters, Sam (Jared Padalecki) or Dean, but more like family. I hear it said a lot that she was an honorary Winchester. There was a line that Dean said: “Charlie is the little sister we never wanted.” And that's really the dynamic that people really loved about Charlie and what I loved about it — because we were like a family on screen and also off screen. The fans, especially those that come to the conventions, seem to be part of that extended family. I love when I walk into the Green Room and I see my friends and we're talking and chatting either in a panel or in front of the fans behind the scenes. We're all just really happy to be together. I've been on a lot of TV shows where that's not the case. Jared and Jensen have done a great, great job of treating everyone equally and having that family feel. What are some of your favorite memories from these conventions? We don't have a lot of role models like Charlie out there. And so if that can impact somebody's real life, the choices they make, the people they love, the confidence that they have being themselves, it's a blessing. How old will your daughter be when she's allowed to watch her mom on Supernatural? I briefly interviewed a father and his 13-year-old daughter on the convention floor. There's nothing better than seeing a parent and a kid come up to me at the cons. They don't make shows like Supernatural or Buffy or those kind of genre shows that are 22 episodes anymore, where you just want to sit down in front of the TV and see a family go through some adventures. Everything's eight episodes every three years, and it just doesn't have the same feel. I'd say thanks for keeping the show alive in your hearts. Because every year the fan base seems to grow, which is a real blessing for us as artists. I'd love to revisit my character one day, and they might make that possible because they still love the show. What was your reaction when you learned Charlie would violently die? How much time were you given to process that? I write a lot of my own stuff because I've been killed off many a TV show. Supernatural was at a time of my life that I really needed to be on that set to be accepted and feel like I was part of a family. But after that sad death in which you died bleeding out in a bathtub, you were called back! That's the blessing of being in a genre show. They brought me back from the Apocalypse World and I got to do some really interesting stuff. Well, the Groundhog Day-like episode “Mystery Spot,” where Jensen dies in different ways during the same day, is one of my favorites as a viewer, but my favorite is the LARPing episode [“LARP and the Real Girl”] where Charlie got to fall in love and kiss a fairy. “And I said, “Great, I would love the LARPing outfit.” They couldn't find it, but I did get the original Charlie lion cat shirt and the Princess Leia shirt. So I do have some of the original wardrobe. I also was given, by producer Jim Michaels, the oil painting that was in the LARPing episode. So I have an oil painting of myself dressed as a queen that I'm not hanging in my house, but I do have it, which is kind of a fun memento. I decided that I needed to downsize and not pay that much money to for a box with things with my face on it anymore. You said that you'd like to come back on some kind of Supernatural project, if that were to happen. If so and Charlie was in it, what would you like her to be doing? It would be one of those jobs where she could take the summers off and travel and also on the side maybe do a little anarchist hacking. Yeah, it would be really fun to revisit Charlie as a character, either the Apocalypse version of her or the OG version. Do you have a favorite on set memory? I can't tell you again how wonderful Jared and Jensen are in that everybody was equal on the set and you've been on a bunch of TV sets, so you know that everyone doesn't get treated equally a lot of the time. That wasn't the case on Supernatural. That's how it should be because everybody contributes equally. I really admire that, and it really set the bar for me for everything I experience on sets now. Charlie is important to me because she's important to the fans and we don't always get that with every role that we have. But the gift of that is pretty special and it makes it easy to be a little more picky in what I choose to do. I consider, “Is the role going to take you away from the things that you love to do in your life? Is it going to be something that you want to live and will mean something to those who see the show?” I'm lucky, I've had a lot of roles and most were written for me. Charlie was written for a “Felicia Day type.” Then, the showrunner, Sera Gamble, thank God, said, “Let's try to get her!” But it's because of the work I'd done on the web and writing my own shows that showrunners like on Eureka and Supernatural wrote me parts. Supernatural is obviously a cult show and you can expound on that a little, but one could say that you are also a cult figure in your own way, no? I've been on a lot of cult shows. I've been in Buffy, Eureka, the web musical Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog [also Adventure Time and Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return]. I also created my own [award-winning] web show, The Guild. I don't want to not make things just because somebody told me I can't make it. And again, it's my work outside the system, just like representing who I am and trying to say it's okay to be like this, that influenced people on Eureka, Supernatural, Buffy, and Dr. Horrible to an extent. All of those roles were created by creative people who liked what I did. I don't get things through auditions very often. It's just like other writers liking me, That would be a dream role because it's so interesting that they're doing this and passing Buffy on to new generations, some of whom already carry a torch for the original show. My dream is to be on a Star Trek or the new Buffy. But if I had to pick one show, it would be to bring Charlie back on Supernatural, because honestly, she's just a really special character.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump's brutal attacks on Europe, which follow his new international policy claims that Europe faces ‘civilisation erasure', are a boost to far right and conspiracy theorists, says world affairs editor Sam Kiley Europe is decaying and run by a cabal of weak leaders, according to a blistering attack by Donald Trump. His outburst follows a new US international policy stance which argues that Europe faces “civilization erasure” and is already indulging in the “censorship of free speech and the suppression of opposition”. “Over the long term, it is more than plausible that within a few decades at the latest, certain Nato members will become majority non-European,” it says. The Trump administration is getting its demographic guidance on Europe from the so-called Great Replacement Theory – a term coined by French conspiracy theorist Renaud Camus, in which he argues that a “global elite” is colluding against the white population of Europe to replace them with non-European peoples. It has a powerful following among far-right groups, QAnon fanatics and Maga supporters. And now it is the official long-term view of America itself. So concerned is the US that it is going to lean in and force a change of direction on Europe by supporting groups which align closely with American policies and undermining those which do not. The Trump administration is fighting Europe's Digital Services Act, which requires internet companies, mostly US-based like Meta, Apple and Google, to moderate content, remove illegal or harmful content, and regulate disinformation. The White House has made allegations of “censorship” against European countries for their efforts to regulate companies that generate huge profits but are anxious that new regulations would be costly to police for them. Its contents closely reflect his startling attacks on Nato and European democracy at his first trip in office to the continent in February. He also threw his weight behind far-right groups and parties then. “America encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit, and the growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism,” the new document says. His regime has become a beacon to many on the far right and Christian evangelicals who support Trump. His unashamed claims to represent traditional white Christian values are catnip to conspiracy fans of the Great Replacement Theory. Trump has backed Russia at every stage since returning to office. He has set his face against Europe's support for Kyiv and for arguments that show Ukraine can eject Russian forces if it gets the support it needs. Trump has cut all aid except for intelligence support to Ukraine while demanding enormous 50 per cent shares in future profits for the US and American companies in any future Ukrainian peace deal. He, like Trump, seeks to amplify disinformation and doubt in Western civil society by claiming that governments, like Volodymyr Zelensky's administration in Ukraine, are illegitimate and undemocratic. The new US foreign policy blueprint for the future claims that when it comes to Ukraine, “A large European majority wants peace, yet that desire is not translated into policy, in large measure because of those governments' subversion of democratic processes.” While that persists and Trump writes outright lies into copper-plated national policy, it is no longer possible to see America as an ally, or even a frenemy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When it comes to literary masterpieces, Bram Stoker's Dracula will forever be in the running. The most notable vampire story, Dracula has produced countless derivative takes on the tale, including a Zenescope Entertainment comic book series titled Helsing. Now that the whole series is on Netflix, there's no better time. Only a few months after its contemporary, Wynonna Earp, was doing something similar on the network, Van Helsing aired on SYFY with a pulse-pounding pilot that felt like The Walking Dead meets the world of vampires. Despite its title, Van Helsing has little to do with the traditional Dracula story, instead largely focusing on a woman named Vanessa Stewart (Kelly Overton), who was attacked by a vampire and left in a coma for three years, only awaking after the world has been ravaged by the undead. Vanessa soon discovers that she is actually a Van Helsing, having come from a long lineage of vampire hunters, tracing back to Abraham Van Helsing (Michael Eklund) himself. But what you think you know about the Dracula legend is flipped on its head come the fourth season, when it's revealed that the Dark One is not what any of us thought. Miraculously, it's through Vanessa's blood that vampires can be redeemed, becoming human once more. What was always compelling about Van Helsing was that, unlike the Zenescope comic it's based on, Vanessa is not automatically a badass vampire warrior. Over the course of the first few seasons, we see her learn and grow and go from a vampire novice to a pro. "I did not want to play a character that came out of the gate just as this monster killing machine that was impenetrable," Kelly Overton told Collider in a 2016 interview. "I really wanted to make her a real person with strengths and weaknesses. The vulnerability was really important to me and, in fact, was one of the biggest challenges for me, in playing Vanessa." Elements such as prophetic visions and utterances, mystical books, and even time travel made their way into the SYFY drama, which aimed to connect the series even further to the original Dracula source material — but only to a point. Van Helsing never claims to be a direct adaptation of Bram Stoker's story, nor does it attempt to honor the long legacy of the monstrous Count in the same way that, say, Hugh Jackman's Van Helsing (which attempted its own TV spin-off back in the day) did. Midway through Van Helsing's fourth season, the series makes an odd change that it never quite recovers from. Introducing newcomers Jack (Nicole Muñoz) and Violet (Keeya King), it effectively writes its leading lady off the show. It's not until the last five episodes of the fifth and final season that Overton returns, just in time for Van Helsing to come to a close. While Wynonna Earp would go on to get a TV movie reunion, Van Helsing ends with the open-ended possibility of more, but no actual need to pursue the story further. For some, that may be a bit of a disappointment, but in an age where far too many shows are canceled on cliffhangers and without any proper conclusion, this is (thankfully) not one of them. If you're looking for a new and engaging take on the traditional vampire story that tosses most of the tradition altogether, SYFY's Van Helsing may be the vampire show on Netflix for you.
