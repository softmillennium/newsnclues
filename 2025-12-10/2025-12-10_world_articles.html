                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's Security Service used Sea Baby naval drones to strike an oil tanker from Russia's “shadow fleet” in the Black Sea on Dec. 10, critically damaging ship as it sailed through Ukraine's exclusive economic zone, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent. The tanker, identified as he Comoros-flagged Dashan, was heading toward the Russian port terminal of Novorossiysk at high speed with its automatic identification system switched off when it was hit, resulting in “critical damage” as explosions ripped through the stern area, the source said. The reported strike on the Dashan follows a series of Ukrainian operations targeting Russia's shadow fleet and related oil infrastructure. Ivan Stupak, a former SBU officer, told the Kyiv Independent that the broader campaign against Russia's shadow fleet is aimed at making the trade too risky for shipowners. “They are trying to scare tanker owners away from entering the Black Sea ports of the Russian Federation and from loading Russian oil there,” he said, adding that “it is a very lucrative business, and there are many who want to be in it.” Days later, Turkish authorities said the Russian tanker Midvolga-2 reported an apparent drone attack about 80 miles off Turkey's coast while carrying sunflower oil from Russia to Georgia, though Ukraine's Foreign Ministry denied involvement and suggested Russia may have staged the incident. Ukraine has also used naval drones to hit infrastructure that services Russia's oil exports. Naval drones struck Russia's oil terminals in the Black Sea ports of Tuapse and Novorossiysk on Sept. 24, “paralyzing” major export operations there, a source in Ukraine's military intelligence, known by its Ukrainian acronym HUR, said. Jared Goyette is an American journalist based in Kyiv and an assistant editor on the Kyiv Independent's War Desk. As Ukraine negotiates a peace agreement with the U.S., soldiers on the ground face a different reality: holding the line with shrinking infantry numbers and almost no rotation. For nearly six months, two Ukrainian soldiers, Oleksandr Tishaiev and Oleksandr Aliksieienko, were trapped in the same battered position on the Zaporizhzhia front, unable to rotate as Russian drones monitored every path in and out. Thirteen children were illegally sent abroad and placed with foreign families for adoption, while law enforcemented intercepted the transfer of another 12. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Hooley died after a "tragic accident" away from the frontline. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has detained Russia's "shadow fleet" ship, which illegally transported agricultural products from the Russian-occupied Crimea, SBU said on Dec. 10. Ukrainian troops in Myrnohrad are using a narrow “gray zone” corridor for rotations and supplies as frontline accounts of near-encirclement clash with official assurances. Ukraine has recaptured 13 square kilometers (5 square miles) of territory in Pokrovsk after previously having no troops left in the city, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said during a Dec. 9 press briefing. Russia's Syzran oil refinery halted operations on Dec. 5 after sustaining damage in a Ukrainian drone attack, Reuters reported on Dec. 9, citing industry sources.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As we produce journalism that combats authoritarianism, censorship, injustice, and misinformation, your support is urgently needed. A new Economist/YouGov poll published this week indicates that a majority of Americans are supportive of higher taxes on the rich, and believe that the federal government has an obligation to address wealth inequality. Asked whether they think billionaires in the U.S. are taxed either too much or too little, 61 percent said billionaires' tax rates were either “somewhat too low” or “much too low.” Eighteen percent said they were happy with how billionaires are currently being taxed, while 14 percent expressed uncertainty. Even among 2024 Trump voters, a plurality (34 percent) felt that taxes on billionaires were too low, while just 12 percent said that taxes on billionaires were too high. Only 6 percent said that the wealth gap wasn't a problem at all. Eight in ten Americans expressed the opposing view, with a majority of Americans, 52 percent, saying that the gap is a “very big” problem and another 28 percent saying it was a “somewhat big” problem. There are several reasons for the U.S.'s widening wealth gap. While the minimum wage has risen a few times since the 1970s, employee compensation, as a percentage of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), has actually declined for most workers, down by 14 percent since that time. Meanwhile, corporate profits have increased by 193 percent since 1970, providing shareholders — who are generally wealthy to begin with — with an increase in dividends of 274 percent as a share of GDP. Put another way, if working class Americans had kept all of the economic gains they had made from 1947 through 1970, and kept pace with those gains to the present day, they would have earned $1.7 trillion more in combined income in the year 2023 alone. Racism also plays a role in wealth inequality, as systemic hurdles continue to make it difficult for nonwhite families to accumulate generational wealth. All three groups have seen increases since that time, but white families much more so — the average family wealth for Black and Latinx families in 2022, for example, was around $211,000 and $227,000, respectively, while for white families, it was over $1.3 million, on average. Providing more public funding for health care would likely correct some (though by no means all) of the problems associated with wealth inequality.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beijing's hypersonic missiles ‘could sink US aircraft carriers within minutes' US reliance on costly, sophisticated weapons leaves it exposed to China's ability to mass-produce cheaper systems in overwhelming numbers, the highly classified “Overmatch Brief” warns. A national security official under Joe Biden who reviewed the document is said to have turned pale on realising Beijing had “redundancy after redundancy” for “every trick we had up our sleeve”, The New York Times reported. Losing Taiwan, the US's key bulwark against Chinese power in the western Pacific, would deliver a severe strategic and symbolic blow to Washington. “I think the high cost of it was really sobering when we did the after-action summaries, and we're like, ‘Okay, like, you guys lost 100-plus fifth-generation aircraft, multiple destroyers, a couple of submarines, a couple of carriers'. “It's like, ‘oh gosh, man, that was a heavy toll'.” China has significantly expanded its arsenal of short, medium, and intermediate-range missiles, which means it could destroy many of the US's advanced weapons well before they could reach Taiwan. Defence officials have realised the US is vulnerable because these complex weapons are impossible to mass produce, following a series of recent wars, including the Ukraine-Russia conflict, which have shown the devastating capabilities of relatively cheap weapons like drones. Mr Trump has appointed Dan Driscoll, the US head of the armed forces, as his “drone guy,” charged with modernising America's outdated tech and countering enemies' drone efforts. However, the US is nevertheless playing catch-up with its adversaries, and experts have previously told The Telegraph that it cannot compete on costs with countries like China, where labour costs are lower and regulations looser. A decisive change in US policy would likely need substantial investment, yet defence spending is at its lowest level in around 80 years, at roughly 3.4 per cent of GDP. Jake Sullivan, the former national security adviser, has warned the US would quickly run out of essential munitions like artillery shells in a war with China. Internal Pentagon assessments show China vastly outnumbers the US in its arsenal of almost all cruise and ballistic missiles. Both superpowers maintain a stockpile of 400 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The US reportedly used up roughly a quarter of its high-altitude missile interceptors to defend Israel against Iran's 12-day ballistic missile barrage in June this year. Moreover, China's state-sponsored hacking group Volt Typhoon has installed malware on critical computer networks for power grids, communications systems and water supplies for American military bases. Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, claims seizing Taiwan is an “historical inevitability” and has ordered his military to be ready to seize the island by 2027. Nevertheless, he is thought unlikely to move unless China achieves such an overwhelming military advantage that it could effectively be certain to take the island. However, since the days of Dwight D Eisenhower, it has viewed the island as an important check on Chinese expansionism, and is obliged by law to provide weapons for Taiwan to defend itself. You know, we're no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn't give us anything,” he told Bloomberg last year. He went on to note that Taiwan was a short distance from China's coast compared to thousands of miles from the US, which gave Beijing “a slight advantage”. “That's the apple of president Xi's eye,” he added. China and the US have launched a frantic arms race to prevent either from achieving a decisive advantage that could embolden Beijing or deny its imperialist ambitions. In January, The Telegraph reported China had constructed D-Day-style barges that could be used to bypass Taiwan's beaches and provide multiple fronts for tanks in an amphibious invasion.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk has said the aggressive federal job-cutting program he headed early in Donald Trump's second term, known as the “department of government efficiency” (Doge), was only “a little bit successful” and he would not lead the project again. Musk said he wouldn't want to repeat the exercise, talking on the podcast hosted by Katie Miller, a rightwing personality with a rising profile who was a Doge adviser and who is married to Stephen Miller, Donald Trump's hardline anti-immigration deputy chief of staff. Asked whether Doge had achieved what he'd hoped, Musk said: “We were a little bit successful. Doge created chaos and distress in the government machine in Washington DC, and by May more than 200,000 federal workers had been laid off and roughly 75,000 had accepted buyouts as a result of purges by Musk's external team of often-young zealots. Musk eventually stepped back from Doge and later the team appeared quietly to have been wound down. Musk, the CEO of electric vehicle company Tesla, who also controls social media platform X and runs aerospace company SpaceX, said to Miller that he would “have been better off running his companies” than Doge. Musk was widely criticized by voices on left for taking a wrecking-ball to government institutions as part of the Trump agenda to allow for greater bureaucratic efficiency, working off a script provided by the Heritage Foundation's controversial Project 2025. He indicated the Doge taskforce was ideologically opposed to liberal initiatives such as refugee services and transgender rights. And they wouldn't have been burning the cars,” Musk said, referring to outbreaks of vandalism after Musk took on the role. After an incident in Oregon in March when shots were fired at a Tesla dealership, police said they were aware that dealerships had been “targeted across Oregon and the nation for political reasons”. Tesla's shares lost close to half their value between January, when Doge was initiated, and March, but have since recovered. The billionaire's SpaceX company is expected to raise more than $25bn through an initial public offering next year, a move that could boost the rocket-maker's valuation to over $1tn. Last month, Doge was formally disbanded with eight months left to its mandate.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a span of less than 12 weeks, ICE filed to block a judge's order granting release 877 times across the country. As we produce journalism that combats authoritarianism, censorship, injustice, and misinformation, your support is urgently needed. Please make a year-end gift to Truthout today. This article was originally published by Documented, an independent, non-profit newsroom dedicated to reporting with and for immigrant communities in New York City. When Juan was granted bond on August 6, it looked as if he would soon be freed from a Brooklyn immigration jail to return to his 6-year-old daughter, 10-month-old son, his partner, and his job at a grocery store. Since he has no criminal record and support from his church, employer and family, the Colombian native was required to post only the minimum bond: $1,500. Immigration Judge Charles Conroy noted in his decision at New York's Varick Street court that the government had submitted no evidence whatsoever that Juan posed any danger. ICE had rarely resorted to this “automatic stay” of a judge's bond decision in the past — just three times in the five years from 2020 to 2024. In less than 12 weeks, from July 1 to Sept. 16, ICE filed to block a judge's order granting release 877 times across the country, records from the Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) show. This means ICE and the Department of Homeland Security now claim to have unilateral power to delay a detainee's release pending appeal. It's not necessary to get approval from the judge who granted bond or from the Board of Immigration Appeals. § 1003.19(i)(2)), there's been at least 50 federal district court rulings in the last six months holding that ICE had violated detainees' constitutional rights to due process in individual cases. “This ‘heads I win, tails you lose' process deprives Petitioner of his due process rights and has no place in the law,” a federal judge in Manhattan wrote in a Nov. 25 decision ordering the release of another detainee, a Salvadoran man who'd been jailed since February. Raha Jorjani, an immigration attorney with the Alameda County Public Defender's Office, published an academic study of the automatic-stay regulation in 2010. She said it wasn't surprising that federal judges have so often rejected use of the rule. “Immigration attorneys and advocates have long warned about the dangers of such regulations remaining in effect, and the current administration's prolific abuse of the regulations validates those concerns,” she said via email. Juan (Documented is withholding his name due to his pending asylum request) was one of the 478 immigration detainees blocked from release during the month of August after ICE attorneys used their automatic-stay-in-jail card. He'd already been jailed for 59 days, starting on June 9 with sleepless nights in the overcrowded lockup at 26 Federal Plaza, where ICE detained him when he reported for a check-in. ICE began using the “automatic stay” work around routinely at the same time the agency issued a July 8 memo that radically re-interpreted federal law to expose millions more non-citizens to mandatory detention — no opportunity for a bond hearing — if they entered the country without a visa. In the cases where detainees were getting favorable bond rulings from immigration judges, ICE filed for hundreds of automatic stays to stop the bond rulings from taking effect during an appeal. These entwined policies have contributed to a massive increase in the number of immigration detainees who give up the right to contest their deportation charges and instead request voluntary departure from the country, as previously reported. As many others have done, Juan's attorneys filed a habeas petition in federal court that challenged both prongs of the government's offensive on constitutional grounds. He was ordered released from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn on Oct. 21, the same day his suit was filed. A more detailed decision on Nov. 18 found, as nearly all other judges did previously, that the government was wrong in its claim that Juan was not entitled to a bond hearing. The judge wrote that it wasn't necessary to determine if the “automatic stay” was unconstitutional, but many other judges have. Manhattan federal judge Vernon Broderick wrote in a Nov. 25 decision that federal district courts have ruled more than 50 times since June 2025 that ICE had violated the constitutional right to due process through its use of the automatic-stay regulation. (One of those cases was for a detainee whom the federal appeals court in Boston has since ordered released.) He had been held by ICE at Orange County Correctional Facility in Goshen for nearly nine months by the time Broderick ordered his release. ICE and the Department of Homeland Security didn't respond to requests for comment. ICE lawyers have rushed to invoke the automatic stay, as Manhattan federal judge Dale Ho described in two rulings that were in favor of a 23-year-old Salvadoran man. J.M.P., as he is named in federal court records, had been assaulted by MS-13 gangsters who extorted money from him and his family's bakery in El Salvador, Ho wrote. At the age of 14, he was convicted of an attempted homicide (with no one injured), and served 14 months in a juvenile facility, according to court records. An immigration judge denied him a bond hearing, but J.M.P. 's attorney filed a habeas petition in federal court, leading to Judge Ho's Sept. 10 order that he be given a bond hearing. That oral ruling at 1:39 p.m. on Sept. 19 set off a bureaucratic race, court records show. At 1:57 p.m., a fund that assists immigration detainees with bond money filed a request with ICE to accept the necessary payment. 's lawyers went back to federal court, where Judge Ho ruled that his rights were again being violated, and that ICE must release J.M.P.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Italian cooking added to ‘intangible cultural heritage' list after campaign by Giorgia Meloni's far-right government Italy already has 21 other traditions on the list, including the art of Neapolitan pizza making and opera singing, and it is the first country to be recognised for its cuisine in its entirety rather than for a single tradition or recipe. In a video message posted on her Instagram account within minutes of the announcement, Meloni said the news filled her with pride. “For us Italians, cuisine is more than just food or a collection of recipes. Meloni's government got to work in pursuing the Unesco recognition soon after coming to power in October 2022, formally submitting its bid five months later. The bid emphasised the links between traditional Italian food, culture and lifestyle, describing it as a convivial social ritual that brings families and communities together. It added: “It is a communal activity that emphasises intimacy with food, respect for ingredients and shared moments around the table … People of all ages and genders participate, exchanging recipes, suggestions and stories, with grandparents often passing down traditional dishes to their grandchildren.” Recipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews. Italy's agriculture minister, Francesco Lollobrigida, who often decries any tinkering with Italian food classics, said the victory was “a celebration that belongs to everyone because it speaks to our roots, our creativity and our ability to transform tradition into reality”. Meanwhile, a report published by Rome's Sapienza University on Wednesday said Unesco world heritage recognition of various Italian locations and traditions, including the prosecco hills in Veneto and the Sicilian island of Pantelleria, known for its bush vine cultivation, had worked wonders for tourism and that now Italian cuisine was on the list, more visitors were expected.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Police arrested 27-year-old after tip-off from McDonald's customer who recognised his distinctive facial features, court hears Evidence shared with a Manhattan court on Tuesday included a note dated Dec 5, 2024 – the day after Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare was shot dead – with bullet points apparently detailing how the Ivy League graduate planned to change his appearance. Bodycam footage of the moment the 27-year-old was apprehended by 30 officers and asked to remove his face mask was also entered into evidence by prosecutors. In the clip, Mr Mangione can be seen giving police the name Mark Rosario and a fake New Jersey ID. Lawyers for Mr Mangione are pushing for a dismissal of the proceedings, contending that the full-length bodycam video shows police interrogating him before he was read his Miranda rights. They have argued it will create a “substantial probability” that the 27-year-old will not have a fair trial, claiming he was questioned for more than 20 minutes beforehand. Officers searched his backpack and found a to-do list and travel plans along with a hand-drawn map of his escape route, according to prosecutors, and alleged tactics for avoiding capture, the court heard. Another listed several tasks, including “change hat, shoes, pluck eyebrows.” “Buy black shoes (white stripes too distinctive),” read another note with a star drawn next to it. Mr Mangione has pleaded not guilty to state charges of second-degree murder, as well as in a separate federal trial where prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.</p>

"It is with deep regret that we must announce that a member of the U.K. Armed Forces died in Ukraine this morning," the ministry said in a statement on social media. British Defense Minister John Healey said on Dec. 9 he was "devastated by the death of a U.K. service person in Ukraine." "My thoughts are with their family, friends and colleagues as they grieve for a loved one. Yuliia Taradiuk is a Ukrainian reporter at the Kyiv Independent. Thirteen children were illegally sent abroad and placed with foreign families for adoption, while law enforcemented intercepted the transfer of another 12. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Hooley died after a "tragic accident" away from the frontline. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has detained Russia's "shadow fleet" ship, which illegally transported agricultural products from the Russian-occupied Crimea, SBU said on Dec. 10. Ukrainian troops in Myrnohrad are using a narrow “gray zone” corridor for rotations and supplies as frontline accounts of near-encirclement clash with official assurances. Ukraine has recaptured 13 square kilometers (5 square miles) of territory in Pokrovsk after previously having no troops left in the city, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said during a Dec. 9 press briefing. The three texts cover a framework peace agreement, security guarantees, and Ukraine's reconstruction, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Ukraine's largest bank, the state-owned Privatbank, extended a Hr 5 billion loan ($118.6 million) to Naftogaz, Ukraine's state-run oil and gas giant, for emergency natural gas purchases, Naftogaz wrote in a press release on Dec. 9.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To train a language model, you need data. For a language like English, the easily accessible articles, books and manuals on the internet give developers a ready supply. But for most of Africa's languages — of which there are estimated to be between 1,500 and 3,000 — there are few written resources available. Tigrinya, spoken by around 9 million people in Ethiopia and Eritrea, has 335. For Akan, the most widely spoken native language in Ghana, there are none. Of Africa's 23 scripts and alphabets, only three — Latin, Arabic and Ge'Ez (used in the Horn of Africa) — are available. This underdevelopment “comes from a financial standpoint,” says Chinasa T. Okolo, the founder of Technēculturǎ, a research institute working to advance global equity in AI. “Even though there are more Swahili speakers than Finnish speakers, Finland is a better market for companies like Apple and Google.” As the continent looks to develop its own AI infrastructure and capabilities, those who do not speak one of these 42 languages risk being left behind. Marivate led the South African arm of the African Next Voices project, which has made recordings of 18 languages in South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria. Over two years, the three teams collected 9,000 hours of recordings from people of different ages and locations, creating a data set which will be available for AI developers across the continent to use to train models. The researchers would sometimes give native speakers scripts to read, but mostly gave them a prompt and recorded their responses, which were then transcribed. For Isindebele, spoken in South Africa and Zimbabwe, they had such a hard time finding written resources that they resorted to a government manual for goat herders to help write their prompts. African Next Voices has not collected enough data to train a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT or Gemini, which can cover thousands of topics in detail. However, Marivate says they focused their recordings on specific topics, such as health and agriculture, that were deemed the most important. For her, it's a question of “prioritizing error.” “If somebody just wants to find out what's happening in downtown Nairobi, I can tolerate errors there,” Moorosi said, but mistakes in models that deal with topics like banking or health care could have serious consequences. The St George's cross, for example, has associations with right wing politics in the UK which are not obvious to someone from Ghana or Lesotho. This problem is particularly prevalent with low resource languages. A study by DAIR found that social media websites had failed to recognize and remove hate speech related to ethnic violence in Ethiopia in part because automated systems and human moderators were not familiar with the slang terms being used. Moorosi says that without this cultural understanding, it is impossible to make “AI systems perform and make judgments that are aligned to our beliefs and values.” However, a lack of data is not the only challenge facing African AI developers. Most African languages are not codified through dictionaries or grammatical studies. Without rules for spellings, even the most basic text processing becomes difficult. The African Union warned in 2024 that only 10% of the continent's data center demand was being met, presenting a bottleneck for Africa's AI hopes. The worry, for Marivate, is that if models are not made for these smaller languages, they will “disappear.” When it comes to developers creating data sets for languages that might not even have writing systems, “the model is going to have to change” he adds. The African Next Voices project has only just finished collecting and transcribing its data. Marivate says it is currently not working on new languages, but he is already thinking about which could be next.</p>

"We have very good prospects in the energy sphere, including nuclear power generation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cans of Campbell's soup are displayed along a grocery store's shelves in New York City.Spencer Platt/Getty Images Growing up, Campbell's soup was a dietary staple in my home. My mother would often have a bowl of chicken noodle and a grilled cheese sandwich waiting for me for lunch when I came home from school. Not surprisingly, the same soup found a home in our pantry when it was time to raise a family of our own. Doubtlessly, this same story has played out across North America, for generations. Imagine my surprise, then, when a story broke recently about a Campbell's executive being caught on tape castigating his company's products, calling it “shit” food for “poor people.” He said the chicken in Campbell's products isn't real, but bio-engineered meat made from a 3D printer. Experts say ultraprocessed foods are a major public health threat. The story did contribute to a broader discussion my wife and I have been having about adopting a healthier diet. We already eat relatively well – fish, vegetables, not too much red meat – still, it's hard not to get caught up in the rampaging debate about the unhealthy nature of the North American diet. It's being blamed for any number of concerning health conditions, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease and cancer. The biggest culprit is ultraprocessed food (UPF), which involves chemical modifications and industrial methods designed to extend shelf life and maximize profits. Health officials have been sounding the alarm about this for some time now. Even Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who heads the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has declared UPFs a scourge. According to some estimates, UPFs make up 73 per cent of the U.S. food supply, and 70 per cent of children's daily caloric intake. An entire Make American Healthy Again (MAHA) movement has sprung up around his efforts. Elsewhere, the city of San Francisco recently filed a lawsuit against food manufacturers over UPFs, arguing that American cities are burdened with the costs of treating diseases that stem from the companies' products, such as Slim Jim meat sticks and Cool Ranch Doritos. That granola parfait may look like a healthy option, but could have artificial sweeteners. Something that bills itself as low-calorie likely includes artificial trans fats. But there's also another huge impediment to eating healthy – costs. Everyone talks about adopting a Mediterranean diet, but that's easier said than done. Eating fresh fruits and vegetables every day is just not financially feasible for millions of Canadians. The pandemic put this goal out of reach for many, and costs have remained prohibitively high since. Statistics Canada says grocery costs have outpaced inflation across the country for nine straight months. Kids are demanding the same cereals that I loved growing up. Only now have I discovered it contains hydrogenated coconut, modified food starch and degerminated yellow corn flour among other things that are undoubtedly awful for you. But it's still flying off the shelves because kids love it, and busy, tired parents don't have the energy to try and convince their children to love Shreddies instead. It's going to take a brave, momentous effort to push back against a food industry making billions selling us food that isn't good for us. It should start, in this country at least, with a massive education campaign about the risks involved. Until we do, people will continue filling their shopping carts with items that cost less, but could ultimately shorten their lives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The daughter of Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado spoke of the country's fight for democracy as she accepted this year's Nobel Peace Prize in Norway on behalf of her mother, who was unable to attend the event. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate had been expected to attend Wednesday's acceptance ceremony in Oslo, in defiance of a decade-long travel ban placed on her. Organisers of the ceremony on Wednesday said Machado was “safe” and was expected to arrive in Oslo in the near future. They added that she had “done everything in her power to attend today's ceremony” but that “her journey involved extreme danger.” In an audio recording released by the Norwegian Nobel Institute before the ceremony, Machado, 58, said, “I am on my way to Oslo right now.” She thanked those who had “risked their lives” for her to travel to Norway. Machado received the peace prize in October for tirelessly promoting democratic rights in Venezuela and “for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,” the Norwegian Nobel Committee said. But Venezuela's government condemned the move, accusing her of encouraging violence and collaborating with foreign powers. Her daughter, Ana Corina Sosa Machado, 34, said the prize carried profound meaning, reminding the world that democracy is “essential” to peace. She spoke of her hope that Venezuela would make an “orderly transition” to democracy. “We will see grandmothers settle children on their laps to tell them stories not of distant forefathers, but of their own parents' courage.” “And more than anything, what we Venezuelans can offer the world is the lesson forged through this long and difficult journey: that to have democracy, we must be willing to fight for freedom,” she said. Venezuelan free-to-air TV channels did not show the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony. In 2002, she founded Súmate, a volunteer group that promotes political rights and monitors elections. In 2012, she founded the Vente Venezuela political party and movement. Her platform included an economic model based on a free market, private property and respect for the rule of law. Machado was among opposition figures in 2014 calling for a wave of protests against Maduro, who became president after Chávez's death. In response, the ruling party removed her from the National Assembly, accusing her of treason and later of plotting assassinations, which she denied. Last year, she attempted to run against Maduro in the country's presidential election, but her candidacy was voided by the regime. She then switched her support to the party of fellow opposition figure Edmundo González Urrutia. When government-aligned electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner, Venezuela's opposition forces cried foul, saying they had evidence to prove González had won. After US President Donald Trump returned to the White House in 2025, the US launched a major pressure campaign against Maduro, amassing more than a dozen warships and thousands of troops off Venezuela's Caribbean shores.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Deep skepticism has surrounded U.S. President Donald Trump's latest attempt to settle the Russia-Ukraine war. Ukraine, backed by Europe, has been clear that it is not prepared to accept terms that amount to surrender, while Russia has given no signal that it will back off its maximalist demands, which would end Ukraine's existence as a sovereign, independent state. That, skeptics argue, leaves no ground for serious negotiations. Russian President Vladimir Putin's evident refusal to make any substantive concessions at his talks with Trump's envoys on December 2 only reinforces their doubts. Nearly four years of brutal combat, in which neither side has achieved a strategic breakthrough, has created a paradoxical situation in which both countries lose the longer the war rages on. The best deal each side can achieve is available now, not in six months or later. Ukraine will not gain anything by waiting to negotiate from a hypothetical future position of strength; such a position will not come soon, if ever. Ukrainian leaders have already acknowledged that they cannot liberate by force all the territory Russia has seized. Nor will a stronger Ukraine incline Western countries to provide it with more formidable security guarantees. Western governments have already made it clear that they will not risk war with Russia to defend Ukraine. Instead of seeking a position of strength, Ukraine urgently needs to settle the conflict, which has devastated the country economically and demographically. Kyiv will find it increasingly difficult to man the frontlines and has yet to demonstrate that it can halt Russia's grinding advance. Each day the war continues, Ukraine's future looks bleaker. But it has paid a staggering price—more than one million dead or wounded—for marginal tactical gains. The forecast for this year and next hovers around one percent growth. Meanwhile, Russia has invested negligible sums in cutting-edge technologies. In short, it is mortgaging its future to sustain the conflict. Nor will it, simply to make Russia feel secure, easily abandon its ambition of joining NATO—the ultimate security guarantee—or cap its military capabilities at levels inadequate to deter future Russian aggression. Indeed, the contours of a final settlement are visible, even if both sides vigorously deny it: a cease-fire along the line of contact without either country formally recognizing the other's control of territory it considers its own; armed neutrality, or sufficient military capabilities to reliably defend one's territory, for Ukraine with the possibility of EU accession but not membership in NATO; and no further NATO expansion eastward into the former Soviet space. Such an outcome would enable Putin to declare victory and Zelensky to claim he had preserved what was most precious—Ukraine's sovereignty and independence as well as its European aspirations. It would also spare both countries the further depredations of continued warfare. But agreement on these terms can only be achieved in strictly confidential negotiations, in which the two belligerents can make the necessary compromises on sensitive issues as part of a broader peace agreement. Achieving this outcome will, however, require a concerted diplomatic effort that engages all parties to the conflict: Russia, Ukraine, and the United States, as well as Europe. But only one country can lead that effort: the United States. As it has already demonstrated, Washington can pressure Ukraine and Europe by threatening to cut essential assistance, including irreplaceable battlefield intelligence. It can also pressure Russia effectively, although not solely through sanctions or arms for Ukraine, which figure most prominently in public discussions. One cannot overstate the role the United States—and Trump personally—plays in validating Russia as a great power and Putin as a global leader. This matters all the more because Russia has struggled on the battlefield against what it (and most Western observers) assumed was a second- or third-tier military. Such a measure will help convince Putin that the United States will not relegate Russia to a secondary tier of interest once the war is resolved. Trump's new National Security Strategy makes clear that the administration no longer considers Russia a major threat, to the consternation of traditional U.S. allies. Washington has already promised normalization once the war is on a clear path toward resolution. That would give Putin confidence that the United States will continue to treat Russia as a serious player, commensurate with Moscow's own self-perception. Earlier this year, it initially embraced the idea of a quick resolution reached through direct talks with Trump, using Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff as a confidential conduit. With the diplomatic situation more complex and the talks narrowing to a few crucial issues, Russian leaders want to establish a more traditional negotiating process. They understand that presidential phone calls and long talks with Witkoff cannot do that, and presidential meetings produce lasting results only if lower-level officials work out the details in advance. That would entail creating expert working groups, which the Trump administration has hesitated to do. The Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov hinted at this approach after Putin's December 2 meeting with Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and occasional envoy. U.S.-Russian talks, Ushakov said, would continue between the presidents, presidential assistants, and other officials. The Kremlin, to be sure, was speaking only of bilateral contacts. But the Trump administration should expand this approach to include Ukrainians and Europeans. This broadened process would require a number of working groups that at a minimum would study territorial disputes, security guarantees, and cease-fire modalities. The composition of the groups would vary by topic: a U.S.-Russian working group could suffice for nuclear issues; Russians, Ukrainians, and Americans could address territorial issues; and Europeans would have to participate in discussions of security guarantees and broader matters of European security. The working groups would initially be tasked with reaching consensus on the elements of a settlement and developing sufficient detail on implementation so that the parties can sign a framework agreement and put a cease-fire in place. Even if working groups are established, the White House–Kremlin channel will be indispensable. It allegedly lacks the discipline, consistency, capacity, and patience to pursue a sustained diplomatic effort. And the U.S. national security apparatus has the expertise and skill needed to manage a complex diplomatic undertaking, if only the administration could find a way to reliably control its own bureaucracy, which it does not trust. But with one last effort, he could once again defy his critics and end a conflict others thought intractable.

MOSCOW, December 10. /TASS/. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will deliver a report on pressing issues of the country's foreign policy at a plenary meeting of the Federation Council on Wednesday morning.

According to Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, regular meetings with senators contribute to deepening coordination between the executive and legislative branches of government toward promoting Russia's foreign policy priorities.

Russia's top diplomat will present the country's key foreign policy priorities, focusing on the most pressing issues on the global agenda. He is expected to lay an emphasis on resolving the Ukraine crisis in light of the latest peace plan proposed by US President Donald Trump.

He will also speak about relations with the United States amid renewed bilateral dialogue and efforts to set new landmarks on security and strategic stability. The Russian foreign minister will perhaps comment on statements from a number of European politicians concerning "preparations for conflict with Russia" and the current state of relations with the European Union against the backdrop of increasingly militaristic rhetoric.

Also, Lavrov will speak about cooperation with friendly nations, BRICS and Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) allies, as well as the development of cooperation with the Global South. He may also address regional issues, including the situation in the Middle East, Transcaucasia and Central Asia.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Chinese Communist Party is threatening Canadian democracy by influencing politicians, business leaders, and community influencers, and suppressing those who speak out against China, says a former national director of the RCMP's proceeds-of-crime program. Clement told the audience that the CCP directs diaspora communities, cultural groups, and business chambers abroad, while monitoring, suppressing, and intimidating dissidents who speak out against China. The CCP's United Front Work Department works to shape narratives in Canadian society and overseas Chinese communities by co-opting elites, business leaders, community influencers, language schools, and media outlets, Clement said. When it comes to influencing Canada's politicians and elites, Clement said that the fact that several high-ranking Canadian politicians have worked at the Canada China Business Council—which he said is involved in suppressing Chinese dissidents in Canada—at the end of their careers indicates they have been influenced by elite capture. “In my view, by allowing the precursors to flow in, they're creating disruptive warfare, just like what happened during the Opium Wars,” he said. Dean Baxendale, CEO of the China Democracy Fund and Optimum Publishing International, also spoke at the forum, calling China's influence on Canada “warfare without combat.” The CCP is involved in a number of statecraft operations in Canada, including hybrid warfare, cyber espionage, illicit trade, organized crime, and transnational repression, Baxendale said. China also engages in financial warfare in Canada by targeting the economy through “debt traps” and using tariffs as an economic coercion strategy, Baxendale said. He added that China has significant influence operations targeting Canada's major ports to facilitate illicit trade practices. She also noted that the CCP uses transnational repression against groups like Shen Yun Performing Arts, a New York-based classical Chinese dance and music company that aims to revive China's pre-communist heritage and expose the ongoing human rights abuses in China. Meanwhile, she said, the CCP also weaponizes Western media through disinformation, which “demoralizes, sows fear, erodes trust, [and] disrupts decision-making.” Cheung said China's tactics aim to “undermine democratic sovereignty, rule of law, and civil liberties—values that we uphold” in Canada. International human rights lawyer David Matas told the forum audience he has encountered a number of different situations involving transnational repression in his work as a human rights lawyer. Matas also mentioned a case in 2004 where officials from the Chinese Consulate in Calgary were distributing anti-Falun Gong hate literature at a University of Alberta conference. He said he has also witnessed Beijing's suppression of media overseas, including certain U.S. media outlets shutting down any reporting on forced organ harvesting in China involving Falun Gong practitioners, Uyghurs, Tibetans, and Christians. Matas said he has experienced Beijing's transnational repression himself when visiting other countries such as Australia and Israel, including having events cancelled where he was expected to speak about China. Cheung raised concern about the “normalization” of the CCP using its tactics in Canada, and said Canadians need to engage in resistance by speaking out, forming alliances, telling their MPs about the issue, and signing petitions “so that politicians can act according to our conscience to protect our society.” He also said that Canadian society needs to improve its digital literacy, protect diaspora communities from coercion, and support transparent and secure democratic processes. If those who engage in transnational repression are not Canadians, they can be deported and banned entry into Canada, he added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canada's fertilizer giants risk becoming the target of a U.S. price-fixing investigation as the Trump administration tries to tackle high input prices and low profits on American farms. One Canadian company – Saskatchewan-based Nutrien Ltd. – is the largest global producer of potash. Potash is one of three fertilizers critical to all major agricultural operations and the U.S. depends on Canada for more than 80 per cent of its demand. Mr. Trump's accusations are misplaced, especially when it comes to potash, analysts and fertilizer industry associations say, but they tap into a real problem unfolding on the American farm. U.S. eyes high tariffs on Canadian fertilizer, subsidies for farmers On Monday, The White House announced US$12-billion in aid for farmers who have faced steep losses this year because of his administration's trade policy. These funds are unlikely to cover the total costs. They also will not address the problem of farm input costs – the largest of which is fertilizer – outstripping farm revenue. In 2025, China didn't buy U.S. soybeans until late October, months into harvest. Soybeans are one of the U.S.'s top agricultural exports, and China has historically been its largest market. Despite sales resuming at the end of October, total soybean sales to all destinations through early November were 40 per cent lower than the same period a year earlier, according to data from the United States Department of Agriculture. The “Farmer Bridge Assistance Program” announced Monday is intended to help farmers market this year's harvest and plan for next year's crop. But this won't cover US$15-billion in nationwide losses accrued from trade war, and mounting input costs. The three essential fertilizers are nitrogen, phosphate and potash. In 2021, China also imposed export restrictions on phosphate and cut shipments by 40 per cent. China supplies around 40 per cent of global processed phosphate. As a result of these low crop prices and high inputs, this year farmers across the U.S. are expected to lose on average US$150 per acre, with total nationwide losses eclipsing US$15-billion, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. The USDA also expects these costs to stay at elevated levels going into 2026. While more competition would be a good thing in the fertilizer sector, which is consolidated, price fixing is unlikely to be happening, said Josh Linville, vice-president of fertilizer at StoneX, a financial services company. Mr. Trump's focus on Canadian potash is also especially misplaced, he said. Potash has remained fairly stable over the past year. But nitrogen and phosphate would be a better focus for growth than potash, Ms. Nigh said. Potash is a rock mined from deposits thousands of metres under the ground. “We look at it as a North American market because, typically speaking, we get along quite well ... a place where we truly need to place investment and increased production, it's more on the phosphate side and nitrogen side.” Although potash is found worldwide, Canada was responsible for more than 30 per cent of global production in 2023. It is also home to the largest reserves with 1.1 billion tonnes. Saskatchewan sits atop high-quality potash deposits and has developed the mining infrastructure to exploit them.

Policy volatility in the form of tariffs and trade wars is also unlikely to drive investment, Ms. Nigh said. Expanding or building new fertilizer plants costs billions of dollars and can take years. These were good moves to bolster investment in fertilizer production, Ms. Nigh said, adding: Tariffs and accusations of price fixing are not. “There is an underlying desire for some additional self-sufficiency or buffer,” Ms. Nigh said.
