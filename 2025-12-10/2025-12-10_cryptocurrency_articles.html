                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin is trading near $92,000 after a stretch of uneven activity that began in late November, and the steadier tone around the largest asset has created a backdrop in which a small group of altcoins can advance without relying on abrupt, flow-driven bursts. Ethereum sits at the center of that shift as its performance often sets expectations for how much risk the market is willing to take. Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $3,330, up by about 7% over 24 hours, and the increase is supported by an improvement in both spot and derivatives participation, with deeper books and steadier bidding in ranges that had previously struggled to hold during last week's retreat. Activity across major venues indicates that traders who had reduced exposure during the November drawdown are gradually re-entering positions, not because sentiment has shifted dramatically, but because the asset's day-to-day usage and continued demand for block space provide a degree of stability even when the wider environment remains cautious. Monero (XMR) is trading near $404, up by roughly 12% in 24 hours, and the climb aligns with periods in which privacy-oriented tokens receive renewed attention from communities that maintain consistent usage regardless of broader sentiment shifts. Depth across several exchanges shows more orderly conditions than last week, with a distribution of bids that implies steady interest rather than isolated buying, which is notable because privacy assets often strengthen when markets search for tokens with established user bases and reliability rather than speculative catalysts. Mantle (MNT) is trading near $1.20, up by about 7% in 24 hours, supported by consistent throughput and engagement across the Layer 2 ecosystem that underpins its value. This behavior aligns with the tendency for infrastructure and scaling tokens to recover earlier than many smaller assets when sentiment begins to ease, because they rely on live activity and measurable network growth rather than short-term narrative swings. Bitcoin continues to anchor sentiment near $92,000, and most major tokens remain confined to narrow ranges while participants wait for clearer macro signals, steadier global liquidity conditions, and confirmation that the recent improvement does not fade with the next shift in funding or equities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ryan Li has long been steeped in the worlds of both AI and crypto. He started working with AI about ten years ago as an undergrad at UC Berkeley and has since built two crypto startups. That experience has led him to conclude that popular AI platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity give rise to far too many hallucinations about crypto—and that those errors can cost traders millions, if not billions, of dollars. That's why he cofounded Surf, an AI platform specialized for the world of crypto. “I think Surf is the best model for crypto, and we want to make sure people trust Surf instead of relying on hallucinations from other models.” It has more than 300,000 people using the platform and has generated more than a million search results, according to the company. He says that 80% of the platform's users are regular people who don't work in crypto, and the remaining 20% are from venture capital firms, exchanges, and other crypto-affiliated companies. The startup says that it has a couple of million dollars in revenue and hopes to reach $10 million by the end of 2026. Surf generates revenue by charging a subscription fee, with users paying $15 to $399 per month on different tiers of the service. Li views his startup's competition as mainstream AI models like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Grok. The company says that its platform performs four times better than ChatGPT and Grok on crypto tasks, based on benchmark testing it co-authored with Princeton University. While ChatGPT may be slightly faster, Surf had answers that were more specific to crypto and had more citations, based on a side-by-side comparison of the two platforms that Li shared with Fortune. “ChatGPT is a really good generalist, but it doesn't know the crypto industry enough,” Li said. “Surf is like that expert that worked in the industry for a long time by us training the model just for crypto.” FORTUNE may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SpaceX is working toward a stock-market listing that could value the company at around $1.5 trillion, making it the biggest public market offering by that metric, according to Bloomberg. If that happens, investors won't just be buying into rockets and satellites. They'll also be buying into a company that holds thousands of bitcoin and has already used dogecoin to fund a mission to the Moon. A Bloomberg report late Tuesday said the Elon Musk–run company is moving ahead with plans for an initial public offering that would seek to raise “significantly more than $30 billion,” targeting a valuation in the region of $1.5 trillion and a listing as soon as mid-to-late 2026. Musk's influence on dogecoin is well documented, from him posting memes that moved markets to SpaceX accepting the token for its DOGE-1 lunar mission. His companies were among the earliest institutional bitcoin adopters, with renewables tech company Tesla reporting over 11,000 BTC holdings on its balance sheet. A SpaceX IPO would give him fresh capital for Starlink expansion and chip-heavy space data centers, potentially broadening his influence in sectors that intersect with both AI and crypto infrastructure. Meanwhile, early data from prediction market Polymarket show growing confidence that SpaceX's valuation at IPO could exceed $1 trillion, with traders assigning a 67% probability that the market cap surpasses the benchmark as of early Wednesday. Trading volume surged 19% above weekly averages as XLM consolidated around critical $0.25 support level.

We know cryptocurrency is driven by incredible underlying technology, constantly pushing for faster transactions and more private, advanced blockchain setups. Today, the biggest challenge isn't building new tech; it's fixing confusing user experience, or UX. Accessibility is king, and history backs this up; it's why booking a taxi on your phone or sending cash instantly via a digital wallet feels so seamless. Crypto can't achieve true, widespread adoption until its apps shed the clunky design and feel just as intuitive and simple as those mainstream services. Even as crypto goes global, a massive user base finds blockchain apps confusing. It's not a niche problem: a 2024 Statista report confirms that over 40% of people avoid digital assets entirely because they cite “complexity.” This isn't about education; it's entirely about bad design. New users simply expect the smooth navigation, clear directions, and predictable setup they see in every other modern app. This creates an unhelpful divide between cutting-edge innovation and real accessibility for the public. Think about online banking apps, which use intuitive layouts to make financial management totally straightforward. Similarly, platforms ranging from casinos online to streaming services heavily prioritize quick feedback, responsiveness, and clarity. Crypto developers can draw several UX lessons from digital platforms that have already won user trust. Good platforms guide new users step-by-step, using visual cues or short tutorials. People naturally gravitate toward interfaces that resemble the apps they already use. By keeping buttons, navigation bars, and icons consistent with common digital norms, crypto apps can reduce the learning curve. Delays or confusing error messages can turn off new users fast. A 2023 Deloitte survey on app engagement showed that responsiveness and real-time feedback significantly increase user retention. Crypto wallets, in particular, can benefit from clearer transaction confirmations and transparent status updates. The tight balance between essential security and everyday simplicity is crypto's biggest UX headache. Smart apps are tackling this directly: Web3 wallets like Argent and Magic ease onboarding with simple social logins or multi-signature systems, simplifying control management without eliminating it. The real secret to good UX design in crypto is surprisingly simple: empathy. This understanding is the foundation for creating tools that are genuinely intuitive and automatically inclusive. Blockchain might have been born in a niche corner of the web, but it's rapidly evolving into a foundational technology for almost everything digital, from finance to supply chains to how we consume media.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Self's “Anti-CBDC Surveillance State” proposal would bar the Fed from testing, developing or launching any CBDC. “The House Rules Committee meets later TODAY to decide if it gets a floor vote,” he added. Notably, during the 2024 campaign, US President Donald Trump called CBDCs a “dangerous threat to freedom” and pledged never to allow a Fed-run digital dollar, once back in office. In 2025, trump singed an executive order intrusting federal agencies not to develop or promote a US CBDC. But since executive orders can be reversed by future administrations, Republican party lawmakers are pushing to lock an anti-CBDC stance through amendments to the NDAA. “Conservatives were promised that language banning a CBDC would be included in the must-pass NDAA,” said Self. They fear real-time tracking and potential blocking of transactions based on political or social behaviour. Some are even threatening to withdraw support from the defense bill itself unless leadership allows a floor vote on Self's amendment. While Anti-CBDC bill aims to permanently block any form of a US central bank digital currency, citing surveillance concerns, the CLARITY Act carries huge weight in the crypto world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All You Need to Know About HumidiFy | Credit: Hameem Sarwar HumidiFi just became one of the most talked-about launches on Solana, and for good reason. As the first-ever ICO on Jupiter , WET burst out of the gate with massive trading volume, rapid community growth, and an immediate move to all-time highs. But with launch hype still unfolding, traders now want to know: Is HumidiFi just getting started, or is the WET rally already topping out? HumidiFi is the liquidity engine of capital markets, bringing every market to trade on Solana. HumidiFi is a hybrid decentralized exchange and market maker, claiming to offer lower fees than centralized exchanges while maintaining full custody. For DTF, this has been a rocky yet ultimately successful first launch. Shout out to all the Weterans for coming on this journey with us. Shout out to our partners at @JupiterExchange  for working with us to implement some extremely wet anti-snipe features on their new DTF platform. Those who have staked JUP  have already made roughly three times their investment, and the community is bullish considering WET is the first Jupiter launchpad. It reached a new all-time high of $0.27 earlier today before falling. The price movement is contained inside an ascending parallel channel. If the WET price breaks out, it could surge to new highs quickly. HumidiFi's debut was one of the strongest launches in recent Solana history. As the first ICO on Jupiter, backed by community hype and early exchange listings, WET has already demonstrated its ability to attract significant demand. However, with the price still consolidating within a rising channel, the next breakout or rejection will determine whether WET enters its next explosive leg up or resets before continuing its upward trend. For now, one thing is clear: HumidiFi has captured the market's attention.</p>

One of Wall Street's biggest bitcoin cheerleaders has significantly dialed down his forecast for the crypto. The price target changes were largely spurred by bitcoin's recent sell-off, Kendrick, the global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, wrote in a note on Tuesday. The crypto is down around 27% from its peak in early October. He said that bitcoin treasuries — firms that buy and hold bitcoin on their balance sheets — likely won't support the price of the cryptocurrency going forward. "Price action has forced us to recalibrate our Bitcoin price forecasts," Kendrick wrote, adding that the firm believed bitcoin treasury buying had "run its course," though ETF inflows could pick up "periodically." It's been a rough year for bitcoin, which was rocked earlier in the year as markets reacted to tariffs, and has been weighed down by worries about higher inflation and fewer Fed rate cuts in 2026. Its latest decline has been brought on by a handful of bearish factors, like low liquidity in the market, a risk-off mood amid rate-cut uncertainty, and speculation that Strategy, the largest corporate buyer of bitcoin, could have to sell some of its token.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cardano's price rose 8.7% in the last 24 hours to $0.463. Leverage was cleared before the price stabilized at higher levels, according to Coinglass data, which shows concentrated long liquidations between $0.44 and $0.46.​ ADA is entering the FOMC window with less overhead pressure, as there were fewer liquidation bands above $0.48. The liquidation heatmap shows heavy long liquidations in two ranges around $3,350-$3,500 and $3,150-$3,250. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) traded at $92,618, up 2.5% from the previous day. Data from Coinglass shows that many leveraged long positions were wiped out near $93,500-$94,500, where the price struggled to rise. On Stocktwits, retail sentiment continued to be in the ‘neutral' territory over the past day, with ‘low' levels of chatter. Binance Coin (BNB) was trading at $890.97, up 0.5% over the past day. BNB retail sentiment remained ‘bullish' with message volumes at ‘neutral' on Stocktwits. For Ripple (XRP), there were dense long liquidations between $2.15 and $2.20, aligning with the intraday ceiling. XRP was trading at $2.08, up only 1% since Tuesday. Retail traders are now eyeing Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, which could provide clues on the direction of the monetary policy for 2026. Speculation is heavy on potential new liquidity measures such as balance sheet expansion or a restart of quantitative easing, which often supports a Bitcoin rebound.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real-world deployment is now visible across key use cases: tokenized deposits for 24/7 liquidity; instant cross-border settlement; shared trade finance ledgers; tokenized assets; and compliance-built-in identity frameworks. These advances can compress settlement times, enhance transparency and create programmable financial flows. As banks move pilots into live environments, the core design question is public versus private networks. Complete the form below for free, unlimited access to all our Data Studies, Trackers, and PYMNTS Intelligence reports. Please confirm your email to view all our Trackers. As the landscape shifts from proof of concept to production, blockchain technology is becoming a part of the connective tissue linking payments, deposits and markets—one component of a shared digital architecture that brings new efficiency while preserving the trust on which global finance depends. This Tracker explores where programmable finance is finding real-world traction, what leading institutions are building today, and what these advances mean for treasury, operations and risk leaders alike. But before we dig into the details, here's a little background for nontechnical readers. Think of it as a common ledger—kept in sync across institutions—where every entry is time-stamped, auditable and hard to alter retroactively. Permissioned blockchains limit access to vetted participants (banks, payment networks, corporates). Both support tokens and coins, which are digital representations of money, claims or assets that can move and settle in near real time. Why it matters: In banking, blockchains can potentially reduce manual reconciliations, shorten settlement windows and make money programmable. For risk and compliance teams, it could also mean greater traceability if designed accordingly. How to read this: Below, we organize today's institutional blockchain activity around five use cases your teams are prioritizing: tokenized deposits; cross-border payments; shared ledgers for supply chains; liquidity for assets, including fixed holdings such as real estate; and security and identity. We also address some of the challenges inherent in choosing between public and private blockchain networks. They're backed one-to-one by deposits, operate within existing regulatory frameworks and can be automated (for example, to sweep cash, release escrow or trigger conditional payouts). For corporate clients, they turn static balances into always-available working capital. J.P. Morgan has extended JPM Coin—its permissioned platform that lets clients transfer dollar deposits on a private blockchain—and announced plans for a USD deposit token to settle transactions on Coinbase's Base network. Together, these initiatives give institutions compliant, round-the-clock access to liquidity. Other institutions such as HSBC have also announced plans for tokenized deposits. In parallel, industry groups and consortia are exploring models such as the Regulated Liability Network (RLN) and participating in BIS-sponsored Project Agora—separate initiatives that aim to connect commercial-bank deposits, central-bank money and other regulated liabilities on shared ledgers to support instant settlement between trusted counterparties. In fact, Citi's “Real Time: 24/7 Finance in an Always-On World” article points to a new baseline: continuous liquidity that shifts treasury operations from reactive to predictive and data-driven. For decades, cross-border transfers moved along correspondent banking networks. In 2024, the bank's blockchain arm was rebranded as Kinexys to unite payments, tokenization and programmable-money capabilities. Citi likewise integrated Citi Token Services with 24/7 USD Clearing to support real-time payments between its clients and those of participating third-party institutions on a permissioned platform. Networks are adapting, too: Visa B2B Connect routes transactions directly between banks on blockchain, and Mastercard is piloting programmable payments for conditional settlement and instant clearing. Ripple expanded RippleNet to offer near-instant cross-border transfers using tokenized fiat and the XRP Ledger for liquidity bridging. Trade finance has been defined by paper, siloed information and post-fact reconciliation. Distributed ledgers potentially replace all that with a single source of truth that participants can rely on—reducing fraud risk and accelerating funding in jurisdictions where digital contracts are accepted by law. Among the initiatives leading this shift was Contour, founded by banks including Citi, HSBC and ING. It was acquired by FinTech firm Xalts in early 2025, with Xalts continuing its work in digitizing letters of credit (LCs) and related processes across the existing network. Tokenization is changing how institutions can issue, trade and hold assets. By representing ownership of securities, funds and even real estate on shared ledgers, banks can combine market liquidity with blockchain transparency for faster settlement, real-time ownership records and more granular control over transfers. BlackRock's BUIDL Fund—launched in March 2024—became the first tokenized U.S. Treasury fund for qualified investors on a public chain, enabling instant settlement and verifiable ownership. Across Europe, BNP Paribas and Société Générale are issuing tokenized funds under MiCA, the comprehensive European Union framework for governing digital assets, while the European Central Bank continues integration work in 2025. As digital assets enter mainstream banking, innovation and regulation are converging in software. The Monetary Authority of Singapore's Project Orchid tests programmable payments with built-in identity verification, and the United Kingdom's Project Rosalind—a Bank of England and Bank for International Settlements (BIS) collaboration—prototyped an application programming interface (API) framework that connected banks, FinTechs and merchants for secure CBDC payments. Many banks are also building shared know your customer (KYC) utilities to store verified credentials on permissioned networks—aligning compliance and privacy. Examples: Citi (RLN), JPM Coin, HSBC Cross-Border Payments: Instant settlement, lower FX/compliance costs, full traceability. Examples: Citi, J.P. Morgan, Ripple, Visa Trade Finance & Supply Chain: Faster documentation, reduced fraud, verifiable provenance. Examples: Contour/Xalts (Citi, HSBC, ING), Komgo Asset Tokenization & Custody: Fractional ownership, instant settlement, transparent reporting. Examples: BlackRock (BUIDL), Goldman Sachs, Citi + SDX Regulated Identity & Compliance: Built-in KYC/AML controls, secure data sharing, enhanced auditability. Examples: MAS CBDC Pilot, BoE Project Rosalind, IMF FinTech Note As blockchain shifts from experimentation to potential implementation in global finance, the question is no longer whether blockchain networks will shape money movement but how they will do so in a controlled, compliant and scalable way across borders, currencies and institutions. As volumes rise and real-world, scalable use cases emerge, the key design choice now sits at the foundation: whether to transact on public, permissionless networks or private, permissioned chains that replicate institutional controls. Public chains offer global reach—an advantage that can support tokenized deposits, cross-border transfers and real-time settlement. But they also introduce questions around risk exposure, liability, regulatory treatment, sanctions compliance and identity assurance, requiring banks to evaluate how they safeguard funds and verify counterparties in an open ecosystem. Yet they can face challenges, since scale, liquidity and network effects may develop more slowly when access is limited. These architectural questions are not roadblocks but design milestones. As institutions move further into rollout, policy frameworks will shape how fast the next wave of adoption unfolds. In practice, banks are advancing along two parallel blockchain tracks. But they raise material considerations: who holds liability when funds move across a public chain, how risk and AML controls are enforced, and how legal frameworks apply at scale. Private, permissioned networks give institutions confidence around identity, data control and transaction governance, aligning more naturally with existing regulatory expectations. Leading banks increasingly are looking to pursue selective interoperability, leveraging private networks for controlled flows and public chains for reach: a model that mirrors early internet adoption and positions blockchain as a shared financial infrastructure layer. The largest banks and payment networks are no longer testing—they're building. The next frontier is alignment: interoperability, standards and policies that connect private-sector innovation with public-sector oversight.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Keith Self Moves to 'Fix the Bill' With CBDC Ban Before Key Hearing Rep. Keith Self (R., Texas) on Tuesday filed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would bar a U.S. central-bank digital currency as the House Rules Committee prepares to decide whether it advances to a floor vote. "Promises were broken to include this language in the NDAA,” Self tweeted. It would also bar Federal Reserve banks from offering financial products directly to individuals or maintaining accounts on their behalf. The amendment also carves out exceptions for "dollar-denominated currency that is open, permissionless, and private," preserving privacy protections similar to those of physical cash. House GOP leaders unveiled the 3,086-page defense bill Sunday without the CBDC ban language that Speaker Mike Johnson had reportedly promised conservatives. Self told Fox Business that conservatives were promised, "an anti-Central Bank digital currency language, authored by Tom Emmer, the whip, would be in the NDAA." After reviewing the bill for several hours, he confirmed it wasn't included. Other Republicans raised the same concerns as Self, with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) noting that she supports crypto but will not support any system that lets the government cut off Americans' ability to control, buy, or sell with their own money. "CBDC inserts the government between you and your money then sets conditions on your access to it,” Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) tweeted on Tuesday. "The President's EO banning CBDC is great, but we need and were promised a law,” he added. In January, President Trump signed his first crypto-related executive order, which prohibits federal agencies from establishing, issuing, or promoting CBDCs in the U.S. or abroad, citing risks to financial stability, individual privacy, and national sovereignty. A House leadership aide told The Hill that efforts to include the CBDC ban "fell apart amid negotiations over the bipartisan housing package," adding that securing a deal on the digital currency restriction "was not something that was ultimately going to be acceptable to our members."
