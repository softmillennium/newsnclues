                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study in the Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior (JNEB), published by Elsevier, evaluated a 12-week home-delivered food and education program among adults in Northwest Arkansas. Participants received diabetes-appropriate grocery boxes along with diabetes self-management education materials in English, Spanish, or Marshallese. The intervention was designed and implemented by researchers at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Institute for Community Health Innovation (ICHI) using a community-engaged approach. After the program, participants' average hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a key marker of blood sugar control, decreased by 0.56 percentage points, a clinically meaningful improvement that lowers the risk of diabetes-related complications. While diet quality did not show significant change, researchers note that providing culturally relevant, in-language educational materials and removing transportation barriers ensured that 97% of participants received the full intended intervention dose. This study demonstrates the potential for home-delivered, medically tailored groceries to make measurable improvements in diabetes management for people experiencing food insecurity and facing transportation barriers. For many people with type 2 diabetes, reliable access to healthy food is not just a convenience-it's essential healthcare." The findings contribute to the growing field of Food Is Medicine (FIM) interventions, which connect nutrition access directly to chronic disease prevention and management. The authors emphasize that future research should explore which elements of such programs-food delivery, nutrition education, or both-most influence health outcomes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new statewide spatial analysis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) has uncovered significant disparities in Maryland's rural communities, offering a striking example of how healthcare accessibility is shaping health outcomes across the United States. More than 90% of larger hospitals are located in urban areas, leaving rural hospitals with fewer resources and very small operating margins. One of the biggest challenges is the shortage of doctors, nurses, and specialists trained in Alzheimer's and dementia care, who are concentrated in urban centers. As a result, patients in rural areas, many of whom are over 80 years old, often face the additional burden of traveling much longer distances to access the care they need. This research demonstrates that where a person lives can determine whether they receive timely diagnosis and care or whether they fall through the cracks. These results come amid ongoing funding challenges serious consequences for older and underserved populations. By identifying hospital accessibility, demographic factors, and comorbidities like diabetes ADRD patterns, the study provides evidence that could inform targeted policy interventions in clinics, hospitals, and outreach programs not just in Maryland, but across rural America. Underserved regions in eastern and western Maryland show high ADRD mortality rates despite low diagnosis rates, suggesting that many cases remain undiagnosed. Regional variations in these relationships were confirmed through spatial analysis, demonstrating that localized factors significantly influence ADRD outcomes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The models, which analyze blood for biomarkers through gene expression with RNA sequencing to detect ALS, also have the potential to predict disease severity - and how long a person might live with the neurodegenerative condition. Patients with ALS typically survive between two and four years after they're diagnosed. However, ALS is difficult for physicians to identify, especially early in the disease. Many early symptoms may overlap with other more common neurological problems. As a result, it can take over a year to get an official diagnosis, and patients may undergo unnecessary tests and procedures. Instead of identifying a single biomarker measure of ALS, Michigan Medicine researchers developed a gene classifier that detected several future disease biomarkers to expedite diagnosis. This tool, called a gene expression biomarker panel, is commonly used in oncology to diagnose breast cancer and classify tumor subtypes. Investigators found more than 2,500 unique genes that express differently in ALS compared to controls, many of which were linked to the immune system. "After testing our model on our own samples, as well as data from other groups, it performed better than any previous attempt at an ALS biomarker signature," said Yue Zhao, Ph.D., first author and research assistant professor in the U-M Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics. "Our results suggest a need for further investigation into this model as a tool to improve diagnostic accuracy and decrease diagnostic delay." Researchers later developed two more biomarker panels using different machine learning models to predict a person's ALS survival. This allowed them to better differentiate between shorter, intermediate and longer surviving cases. No other biomarker is clinically developed for ALS prognosis. However, past research has associated levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL), an indicator of neuronal damage, with ALS disease progression. The shortcoming with NfL, researchers note, is that levels are also elevated for other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis. "While there are several methods of scoring and scaling ALS, our method is unique in its diagnostic and prognostic potential," said co-author Stephen Goutman, M.D., M.S., director of the Pranger ALS Clinic, associate director of the ALS Center of Excellence, and Harriet Hiller Research Professor at U-M. Investigators leveraged the core genes to discover eight potential drugs that could have future therapeutic potential in ALS, after more research is completed. Some of those drugs, such as the antipsychotic trifluoperazine and the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib, have been previously linked to ALS research. Researchers say future studies are needed to validate these findings and drug targets before they can be applied to the clinical space. "Pursuing these important next steps has incredible potential to advance diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities in ALS that could ultimately improve clinical care," said Maureen A. Sartor, Ph.D., co-senior author and a professor of computational medicine and bioinformatics at U-M Medical School.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers from the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore (NUS Medicine), and NHG Health's Institute of Mental Health (IMH) have mapped how brain networks differ in individuals at Clinical High Risk (CHR) for psychosis, providing a new perspective on the mechanisms underlying the disease onset. Published in Molecular Psychiatry, the study utilized advanced neuroimaging methods to identify early, network-level changes in more than 3,000 individuals at varying levels of risk. The study – led by Dr. Siwei Liu, Senior Research Scientist, and Associate Professor Juan Helen Zhou, Director, both at the Centre for Translational Magnetic Resonance Research (TMR), NUS Medicine, and in collaboration with Associate Professor Jimmy Lee, Senior Consultant Psychiatrist and Clinician-Scientist at IMH – sought to determine how brain networks can reveal signs in young individuals with heightened clinical risk of developing psychosis. Using data from the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics by Meta-Analysis-Clinical High Risk (ENIGMA-CHR) working group, the team analysed brain scans from over 3,000 participants aged between 9.5 and 39.9 years across 31 global sites, including Singapore. The local data came from IMH's Longitudinal Youth-At-Risk Study (LYRIKS), which was initiated in 2008 and led by Assoc Prof Lee, to identify clinical, social, neuropsychological and biological risk factors unique to individuals at high risk of developing psychosis. The study compared the brain network patterns between young people at high risk for psychosis and healthy individuals, as well as between those who later developed psychosis and those who did not. Using graph theory-based network analysis, they mapped how different brain regions communicate structurally. Regional neighbours share both direct and indirect connections, supporting effective local processing. Even with minor damage in one region, neighbouring regions can still communicate through alternate paths. Efficient long-range communication means that even far-apart regions can exchange information quickly using only a few steps. Differences in frontal and temporal brain areas were also linked to whether an individual developed psychosis later in life and how severe their symptoms were, suggesting that brain network patterns may play an important role in the transition to psychosis. The findings also indicated that individuals at high risk for psychosis exhibited early disruptions in the organization of brain networks, despite showing only mild clinical symptoms. "Treating the brain as a complex network has allowed us to capture subtle but meaningful differences in communication pathways," said Dr Liu, first author of the paper. "These findings highlight the potential of brain imaging to detect early alterations and how early changes in network structure may contribute to the onset of psychotic symptoms." Dr Liu is also a Senior Research Scientist at the Centre for Sleep and Cognition, NUS Medicine. Assoc Prof Zhou, corresponding author of the paper, added, "This study underscores that psychosis is not a sudden event but a progressive process reflected in the brain's communication networks. Individuals at high clinical risk already show distinctive patterns of reduced integration and local efficiency. Understanding these patterns gives us an opportunity to identify at-risk individuals earlier and with greater precision. Assoc Prof Zhou is also a Principal Investigator at the Centre for Sleep and Cognition, NUS Medicine. This study represents a significant step forward in understanding the biological trajectory of psychosis. By examining nearly 3,000 young people across multiple sites, we now have robust evidence that brain network disruption follows predictable patterns years before clinical symptoms fully emerge. This isn't about finding a single faulty brain region, but understanding how the brain's systems gradually become less coordinated, which opens a crucial window for early intervention that we've never had before. Being able to identify possible onset of psychosis early would allow us to intervene before symptoms take hold, improve long-term outcomes and reduce the impact of psychosis on young people's lives." Associate Professor Jimmy Lee, Senior Consultant Psychiatrist and Clinician-Scientist at IMH Young people at high risk for psychosis often face social difficulties, additional mental health issues, and a lower quality of life, creating a significant burden on them. Preventive interventions could help ease this burden and possibly reduce the risk of progressing into fully developed psychosis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EpilepsyGTx, a biotechnology company focused on research and development of cutting-edge gene therapies to treat refractory epilepsy, today announced it has raised $33 million in a Series A financing to advance its lead program EPY201 through Phase 1/2a clinical trials. EPY201 is an adeno-associated viral (AAV) gene therapy designed to reduce neuronal hyperexcitability. EpilepsyGTx will also advance a pipeline of transformative gene therapies targeting refractory epilepsy and disorders of neuronal hyperexcitability with future financings. Focal epilepsy describes a group of disorders in which patients experience seizures that arise from a specific part of the brain. If seizures persist despite trials of at least two tolerated and appropriately chosen antiseizure medicines, epilepsy is deemed refractory. EPY201 offers the potential to eradicate seizures in patients with FRE with a single intervention, dramatically improving survival and quality of life. Our novel gene therapy EPY201 delivered directly to the seizure focus has the potential to stop seizures with a single, minimally invasive administration. In doing so, it will change the way refractory epilepsy has been treated for decades. We are proud to have the support of such high caliber investors as we progress into clinical trials." Federica Draghi, Managing Partner of XGEN Venture, added: "EpilepsyGTx is pioneering a novel, locally administered gene therapy approach designed to achieve targeted modulation of epileptogenic brain regions. We believe that localized gene delivery offers a powerful avenue for durable and disease-modifying interventions in severe neurological disorders and are excited to support the company as EPY201 progresses toward clinical evaluation." EpilepsyGTx previously raised $10 million in pre-seed and seed funding led by the UCL Technology Fund, managed by AlbionVC in collaboration with UCL Business, the commercialization company of UCL with participation from Zcube, the venture capital arm of Zambon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza has affected more than 184 million domestic poultry since 2022 and, since making the leap to dairy cattle in spring 2024, more than 1,000 milking cow herds. A new study led by Iowa State University researchers shows that the mammary glands of several other production animals – including pigs, sheep, goats, beef cattle and alpacas – are biologically suitable to harbor avian influenza, due to high levels of sialic acids. The main thing we wanted to understand in this study is whether there is potential for transmission among these other domestic mammals and humans, and it looks like there is." Sialic acid, a sugar molecule found on the surface of many types of animal cells, provides an influenza virus the microscopic docking station it needs to infect a host cell, an entry point for attaching and invading. A study by many of the same researchers last year found that dairy cattle udders have high levels of sialic acid, which helped explain why the H5N1 avian influenza outbreak was able to spread rapidly among dairy herds. Only a few sporadic cases of H5N1 infection have been reported in the animals examined in the new study, but those species aren't being tested on a widespread basis, said Dr. Todd Bell, professor of veterinary pathology and a study co-author. In dairy herds, H5N1 infections are causing sick cows to produce milk contaminated with the virus, prompting nationwide surveillance testing of raw cow milk samples by the USDA. Pasteurization kills influenza viruses, so store-bought milk is safe. But concerns about raw milk should extend to other mammalian livestock, Nelli said. "Some people do consume the raw milk of these other animals," he said. The presence of the virus in milk from infected cows has likely played a role in the H5N1 spreading and makes transmission to humans a bigger risk, Nelli said. "If a virus in livestock is being spread by respiratory infections, few humans will be in close enough contact to catch it. But milk is an entirely different situation because it's transported into communities," he said. All of the mammary gland tissues examined in the new study had sialic acid receptors preferred by both avian influenza and the seasonal influenza that circulates more readily among humans. The possibility of both types of viruses comingling and transmitting between different species heightens concerns about more dangerous adaptations emerging, Bell said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Downing several strong energy drinks every day may pose a serious stroke risk, doctors have warned in the journal BMJ Case Reports, after treating an otherwise fit and healthy man in his 50s with a daily 8-can habit and exceedingly high blood pressure. On admission to hospital his blood pressure was 254/150 mm Hg, which is regarded as extremely high. He was started on drugs to lower his blood pressure, and his systolic blood pressure-reflecting arterial pressure during the heart's pump action-fell to 170 mm Hg. But once back home, his blood pressure rose again and remained persistently high despite the ramping up of his drug treatment. He was asked to give up this daily habit, after which his blood pressure returned to normal and blood pressure lowering drugs were no longer needed. But he didn't regain full feeling on his left side. Commenting on the experience, he said: "I obviously wasn't aware of the dangers drinking energy drinks were causing to myself. (I) have been left with numbness (in my) left hand side hand and fingers, foot and toes even after 8 years." The report authors point out that the man's lack of awareness about the potential cardiovascular risks associated with heavy energy drink consumption is probably not surprising as they aren't generally thought of as a potential cardiovascular disease risk. "The year 2018 saw major UK supermarkets implement a voluntary ban on sales of [these drinks] to under 16s in a drive to tackle obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay, but less explored are the possible increased risks of [energy drinks] for cardiovascular disease, including ischaemic [restricted blood supply or blood clot] and hemorrhagic [bleed in the brain] strokes, particularly in younger demographics otherwise expected to have lower stroke risk," they emphasize. Energy drinks contain more than 150 mg of caffeine per litre and typically have a very high glucose-based sugar content and varying quantities of other chemicals, they highlight. "This declared amount is the 'pure caffeine', but other ingredients contain 'hidden caffeine'- for example, guarana is thought to contain caffeine at twice the concentration of a coffee bean. "The hypothesis is that the interaction of these other ingredients, including taurine, guarana, ginseng and glucuronolactone, potentiates the effects of caffeine heightening stroke [cardiovascular disease] risk through numerous mechanisms," they explain. "The average [energy drink] is said to contain around 80 mg of caffeine per 250 ml serving, compared with 30 mg in tea and 90 mg in coffee, but in some cases can contain up to 500 mg in a single serving," they point out. This report represents just one case, but the authors nevertheless conclude: "While the current evidence is not conclusive, given the accumulating literature, the high morbidity and mortality associated with stroke and [cardiovascular disease] and the well-documented adverse health effects of high-sugar drinks, we propose that increased regulation of [energy drink] sales and advertising campaigns (which are often targeted at younger ages) could be beneficial to the future cerebrovascular and cardiovascular health of our society."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sexual violence against children and intimate partner violence against women are two of the most devastating yet persistently underrecognized global health challenges and rank among the top risks for mortality and morbidity worldwide, according to research published in The Lancet today. The new analysis is part of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2023 study that provides refined prevalence estimates and reveals an attributable disease burden far greater than previously understood. These findings fundamentally challenge the persistent view of SVAC and IPV as primarily social or criminal justice issues and underscore their status as major public health priorities." Dr. Luisa Sorio Flor, lead author and assistant professor at IHME Researchers incorporated new evidence into the GBD 2023 study, showing SVAC and IPV are linked to a wider spectrum of health outcomes than previously recognized and resulting in significantly greater estimates of health loss. "By expanding the recognized adverse health outcomes linked to sexual and physical violence, we are deepening our understanding of a crisis that has remained in the shadows," said Dr. Flor. "The burden is staggering-and has been systematically overlooked in global health priorities." In 2023, over 1 billion people aged 15 and older were estimated to have experienced sexual assault during childhood, and 608 million girls and women in this age group have ever endured physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner. These risks were shown to be especially devasting for young and middle-aged individuals. Among women aged 15-49 years, IPV and SVAC ranked as the fourth and fifth leading risk factors for loss of healthy life globally, outranking many well-known threats such as high fasting plasma glucose or elevated blood pressure, and close in ranking to iron deficiency (ranked second), a longstanding focus of women's health interventions. "These findings make the case irrefutable: violence is not simply a social problem that occasionally impacts health, it is a leading cause of death and disability demanding comprehensive public health action." In the GBD high-income region, which includes countries in Europe, Latin America, North America, and Oceania, SVAC's contribution to health loss ranked fourth overall, comparable to the disease burden imposed by smoking (ranked fifth), a risk factor that has experienced substantial declines in recent decades as a result of comprehensive, evidence-based control measures, strong policy commitments, and coordinated global action. In 2023, SVAC was associated with 290,000 deaths worldwide, predominantly from suicide, HIV/AIDS, and type 2 diabetes. Substance use disorders were also significant, especially among males in high-income locations. Alarmingly, the authors estimated that nearly 30,000 women were killed by their partners in 2023 alone, highlighting an urgent need for enhanced protection for at-risk individuals. Of the eight health outcomes associated with IPV, anxiety and major depressive disorder were the largest contributors to this overall burden, measured in DALYs, for women across most world regions, except in sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV/AIDS was predominant. "Given the wide range of health conditions associated with SVAC and IPV, survivors will continue to require both immediate and long-term care from health systems worldwide," explained Dr. Flor. "Violence prevention is not enough: we must also identify, protect, rehabilitate, and support survivors, and the health sector is central to these efforts." The study highlights the fact that violence is preventable through effective interventions such as comprehensive legislation and enforcement, trauma-informed health care, school-based prevention, community engagement, economic empowerment, and coordinated action across sectors. "Rigorous data like this bring long-overdue clarity to the scale and consequences of violence experienced by women and children," says Dr. Anita Zaidi, Gender Equality President, Gates Foundation. "The evidence is unmistakable: these harms are far more pervasive and far more damaging to health than previously understood, and they demand immediate action from country leaders. Acting on it is essential to break cycles of trauma that carry forward for generations."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Doctors treating seriously ill patients in an emergency setting may want to give the sedative etomidate, rather than ketamine, while placing a breathing tube, according to a randomized trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The Randomized Trial of Sedative Choice for Intubation (RSI) is the first multicenter trial to demonstrate significant cardiovascular risks of high doses of ketamine (low blood pressure, arrhythmia), side effects that have not been well studied in the past. We know that patients receive treatments every day in hospitals around the world that have never been evaluated in a rigorous study and may be ineffective or even harmful." Jonathan Casey, MD, lead author, associate professor of Medicine, Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center "Studies like RSI are critically important to understand the treatments that patients are already receiving and to ensure that patients receive the treatments that will result in the best outcomes," he said. Casey co-led the trial with Matthew Semler, MD, MSCI, associate professor of Medicine in the Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at VUMC, along with a team of patients, clinicians and researchers from six cities across the U.S. "For more than 40 years, they've been administered to millions of critically ill adults each year. Yet, our RSI trial is the first large, multicenter trial to examine which of the two medicines results in best outcomes for patients. Going forward, many clinicians will choose to use etomidate rather than ketamine. These findings emphasize why more research must focus not just on the development of new drugs and devices, but also on understanding which treatments patients are already receiving produce the best outcomes," he said. Historically, etomidate was the more commonly used sedative, but it was found to impair production of cortisol, which raised concerns that it could increase the risk of death following intubation. Based on these concerns, some countries removed etomidate from the market. In many settings, ketamine replaced etomidate as the primary sedative during emergency tracheal intubation. The potential risks of ketamine were brought to public attention in 2023 when the drug was thought to be a cause of "Friends" actor Matthew Perry's death. For next steps, the researchers are evaluating the effect of sedative medications on long-term patient-centered outcomes like symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder at 12 months. They are also conducting the INSPIRE trial, evaluating the use of the neuromuscular relaxing medications that are given along with a sedative during emergency tracheal intubation to relax patient's muscles for breathing tube placement. "Whether the benefit of giving neuromuscular relaxing medication outweighs the risk remains unknown and is important to evaluate in a rigorous study," Casey said. Finally, VUMC is also leading a large, multicenter randomized trial (BREATHE) that seeks to understand whether using a smaller size of breathing tube can prevent injury to patients' vocal cords and long-term problems with breathing, speaking and swallowing.
