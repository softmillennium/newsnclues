                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brat Summer lives on at Sundance Film Festival, where Aidan Zamiri's The Moment starring Charli XCX will make its premiere. Following “a rising pop star [that] navigates the complexities of fame and industry pressure while preparing for her arena tour debut,” it imagines how Charli's blockbuster album era might have played out had she made different decisions. Directed by Edward Lovelace and James Hall, a logline for the film reads, “Now sober and set to release new music for the first time in over a decade, Courtney is ready to reveal her story.” More music history will be captured through the world premiere of Tamra Davis' documentary The Best Summer, an “all-access view inside an era-defining moment in music” with behind-the-scenes footage featuring Beastie Boys, Sonic Youth, Foo Fighters, Pavement, Rancid, Beck, The Amps, and Bikini Kill. Davis previously helmed 2010's Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child, and directed Britney Spears in Crossroads. The singer and songwriter Marianne Faithfull, who died earlier this year at age 78, will see her story captured in Broken English. The film from Jane Pollard and Iain Forsyth premiered at the Venice International Film Festival this summer, but will make its U.S. debut at Sundance. Broken English takes its title from Faithfull's 1979 New Wave comeback album. “Made with her full involvement, Broken English is an intimate and unflinching exploration of a fractured yet unbreakable life shaped by fame, creativity and relentless public scrutiny,” a description of the film reads. Broken English stars Tilda Swinton, George MacKay, Sophia Di Martino, Zawe Ashton, and Calvin Demba. Sundance 2026 will see director Joanna Natasegara make her documentary feature debut with The Disciple, which provides a look inside the making of Wu-Tang Clan's supposedly one-of-a-kind album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin. The film, which as of this September was still incomplete, according to The New Yorker, surfaces footage from a 1972 reunion of figures from the Harlem Renaissance, which gathered passionate and creative minds with nuanced and critical insights into race, politics, art, and more. Taylor Swift's Last Album Sparked Bizarre Accusations of Nazism. Stephen Colbert Urges Paramount to 'Uncancel One of Their Best Shows' Amid Warner Bidding War His wife, Louise Archambault Greaves, chipped away at the project until her death in 2023. Figures that appeared at Greaves's party, and made it into the film, include Eubie Blake, James Van Der Zee, Gerri Major, Jean Blackwell Hutson, Richard Bruce Nugent, and others. Also premiering at Sundance 2026 is Paralyzed by Hope: The Maria Bamford Story. “Blurring the line between performance and personal crisis, comedian Maria Bamford turns her mental health journey into material that's riotously funny and ultimately inspiring,” a description of the film reads. “What emerges is a portrait of an artist transforming vulnerability into creative strength through honesty.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Depp shared the news in an appearance to promote the project at Saudia Arabia's Red Sea Film Festival on Wednesday. Depp will produce alongside Stephen Deuters and Stephen Malit under his IN.2 Film banner, alongside Svetlana Dali, Grace Loh, Natalia Rogal, and Robert MacLean for Tribune Pictures. Exec producers include the late Michael Lang, Nevin Shalit, Andrew Fourman World Visions' Konstantin Elkin and Tribune Pictures' Michael Paletta. Awards Season Fires Up With Jennifer Lawrence, Sydney Sweeney, Russell Crowe & Cannes Grand Prix Winner 'Sentimental Value' - Specialty Preview 'Severance's Tramell Tillman & Ian McKellen Join Johnny Depp In 'Ebenezer: A Christmas Carol' The project reunites Depp with Dali, who exec produced the Depp-led, World Vision and Red Sea Film Foundation-backed Jeanne du Barry and Modì: Three Days on the Wing of Madness. Set between 1930s Moscow, where the devil returns with his talking cat to cause havoc amongst its corrupt citizens, and Jerusalem during the time of Pontius Pilate, the book tells a fantastical, satirical tale of love, artistic freedom and the eternal battle of good versus evil. A third intertwined story follows a struggling writer and his lover, Margarita, who is willing to do anything to save him from the totalitarian system. Depp was one of Hollywood's biggest and most in-demand stars until his extended legal battle with ex-wife Amber Heard, leading to a period in which he wasn't seen in studio movies. Most recently seen in international titles like Minamata and Jeanne du Barry, he's spoken about feeling “boycotted” by Hollywood in the wake of the saga with Heard and indicated that he might be done with the town. First, he wrapped production on Day Drinker, a Lionsgate action-thriller from Marc Webb that reteamed him with frequent co-star Penélope Cruz. More recently, he's signed on to star in Paramount's Ebenezer: A Christmas Carol, a retelling of the classic Charles Dickens story from director Ti West, on which we were first to report. Depp is represented by Jack Whigham at Range Media. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With the Sundance Film Festival heading to Boulder, CO, in 2027, it's leaving its Park City, Utah home of 44 years with nothing less than a bang and a lot of heart. But there will be a lot of laugh for next year's edition, the lineup for which was revealed Wednesday morning. The selection features a big footprint from comedy films including Olivia Wilde's The Invite, David Wain's Gail Daughtry and the Celebrity Sex Pass, Eleanor Wilson and Alex Huston Fischer's Wicker, Cathy Yan's The Gallerist, the John Wilson documentary The History of Concrete, Josephine Decker's Chasing Summer, Macon Blair's The Shitheads, Casper Kelly's Buddy, and a Judd Apatow and Neil Berkeley documentary about stand-up Maria Bamford. Major studios can't pump out comedies for the big screen, hence it's left to the independent filmmakers to fill the void. Tammie Rosen Dies: Sundance And Tribeca Communications Chief Was 49 Max Walker-Silverman's Sundance 2025 Breakout 'Rebuilding' Sells To Canada Ahead Of U.S. “Independent filmmakers are exploring comedy as a way to explore personal stories,” Eugene Hernandez, Director, Sundance Film Festival and Public Programming tells Deadline. Part of Sundance's goodbye to Park City include several restored festival classics and reunions (which are still being assembled), i.e. the ultimate 2x Oscar winner Little Miss Sunshine, Gregg Araki's Mysterious Skin, New Line comedy House Party, Lionsgate's original Saw, Ryan Fleck's Ryan Gosling-Anthony Mackie movie Half Nelson, and the late Lynn Shelton's Humpday to name a few. Coincidentally, there's a small nod to Utah itself before Sundance leaves town: the Abby Ellis directed documentary The Lake which has a logline that reads “an environmental nuclear bomb looms in Utah.” And, of course, it wouldn't be Sundance without hot political topics melting the snow, i.e. the Focus Features docu The A.I. Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist from Navalny filmmaker Daniel Roher; the American Doctor about three American medics — Palestinian, Jewish and Zoroastrian– and their work in Gaza; the Mexican border female drama The Huntress, and the docu Everybody to Kenmure Street which follows the dilemma of immigrant deportations in a small Scottish neighborhood. In addition to the huge 105 projects selected for their 2026 lineup, Sundance 2026 will pay homage not only to its longtime snowy mountain home, but also to its late founder Robert Redford who passed on Sept. 16 at 89 years old. As previously announced, Redford will be remembered on night 2 of the festival during its Gala Celebration. In addition, there's a screening of the 1969 Robert Redford movie Downhill Racer from director Michael Ritchie; a movie in which the former played a cocky U.S. team skier. It was a title close to Redford's indie soul. “Downhill Racer was a film he would talk about often at the Director's Brunch when he'd gather all the filmmakers from that year's festival, and talk to them about his difficulties in obtaining an independent vision and protecting the integrity of a project, which he produced in addition to starring in. It connected him with the filmmakers at each year's festival. We felt in all his extraordinary body of work, that was the film that was most connected to Sundance,” said John Nein, Sundance Film Festival Senior Programmer and Director of Strategic Initiatives. “The 2026 Sundance Film Festival will be a truly pivotal and memorable moment as we celebrate artists and their visionary works, honor our Sundance Institute founder, Robert Redford, and his transformative vision, and show our gratitude to Utah by commemorating our collective journey,” said Amanda Kelso, Sundance Institute Acting CEO. “We are eager to once again foster connection and creativity as we champion and share independent storytelling with audiences. This marks an especially defining year of coming together as a community to uplift independent film and the legacy of the Festival.” Added Hernandez, “The program broadly so perfectly embodies the spirit, the history and the vitality of what this festival has tried to bring to Park City and Salt Lake City and the state of Utah for the last 40-plus years. You see in the program some familiar names and faces, but also that 40% of the films are coming from first-time feature directors.” “The program for the 2026 Festival invites audiences to experience intimate character journeys, deeply human stories, and compelling explorations of stories from around the globe,” said Kim Yutani, Sundance Film Festival Director of Programming. “Each year, we have the privilege of introducing distinctive storytellers to audiences, and we are grateful to the artists who entrust us with their films at the start of the journey. The upcoming edition will be especially profound in introducing brand-new works while concurrently marking the significance of the many films we have been fortunate to present and gone on to have a long-lasting impact on independent film and culture.” Despite film festival markets being in a bit of funk lately, with sales occurring slower and closing outside events, more than 65% of the Sundance line-up is for up for sale. Hernandez says that figure is “consistent” with previous years. Two of the big sales last year included NEON's pick-up of the Dave Franco-Alison Brie horror movie Together and Netflix's high teens acquisition of the Joel Edgerton period drama Train Dreams, which is a buzzy title in this year's awards season mix. Aside from Focus Features' The A.I. Doc, those titles arriving to the festival with distribution attached include ESPN's Give Me the Ball! and The Brittney Griner Story in Premieres, Netflix's Queen of Chess in Premieres, Searchlight's In the Blink of an Eye in Premieres, NatGeo's Time and Water in Premieres, HBO Doc's When a Witness Recants in Premieres, A24's Nuisance Bear in U.S. Doc Competition, PBS American Masters' American Pachuco: The Legend of Luis Valdez in U.S. docs, A24's undertone in Next, ITVS' Jaripeo in Next, Black Bear's Tuner (which played TIFF) in Spotlight, and Amazon MGM Studios' Bait in episodic. The 2026 Sundance Film Festival program was curated from 16,201 submissions from 164 countries/territories, including 4,255 feature-length films.

Brooks built a successful film career writing and directing romantic dramedies, the kind of films for adults that Hollywood supposedly doesn't make anymore. Most of his work centers upon headstrong women in crisis — his two classic 1980s films, “Terms of Endearment” and “Broadcast News,” being prime examples — and Brooks takes seriously their struggles in life, work, and love, even when they're sources of humor. Comedy and pathos act as companions in his films; scenes often begin funny and end sad (or vice versa), partly to juice the writing with unpredictable tension, but also because those modes are rarely siloed in real life anyway. Brooks' most beloved films garnered acclaim because people could see themselves in his characters and their dramas. Related Stories Sundance Programmers Break Down a 2026 Lineup Filled with Comedies and Lots of Charli XCX Sundance Film Festival 2026 Lineup Includes New Films from Gregg Araki, Judd Apatow, Josephine Decker, Jay Duplass Of course, Brooks' worlds have better lighting, and an all-seeing author to provide a constant dialogue polish. His films were always stylized, featuring key performances heightened a few notches above naturalism, but Brooks took flight of reality with “How Do You Know,” his 2010 romantic comedy that flopped critically and commercially. I suspect that that film, which chronicles a love triangle between two professional athletes and a businessman indicted for stock fraud, threw people for a loop because its characters behaved less like real people and more like daffy archetypes from classic Hollywood, its milieu felt like an artificial construction instead of a convincing simulacrum of our world. Brooks' films were always influenced by the likes of Preston Sturges, Howard Hawks, and Ernest Lubitsch, but with “How Do You Know,” he embraced the farcicality of it all. Brooks cues the audience with storybook narration, delivered by Julie Kavner in her first on-screen role in nearly 20 years, that explains the film takes place during a time when “we all still liked each other.” Whether that introduction strikes you as impossibly naïve or a requisite leap of faith will determine if Ella McCay, both the film and the plucky protagonist, rings true. In classic Brooksian fashion, this simple succession plan becomes complicated by a potential scandal involving her social climber husband (Jack Lowden), the sudden return of her womanizing father (Woody Harrelson), and, well, Ella McCay's own stubbornly idealistic personality. Various relationships arrive at their endpoint and conflicts reach closure in similarly speedy fashion. (Albert Brooks does considerably better than Spike Fearn, for example.) Mackey does especially skillful work conveying the legibility of Ella's personal anxiety and political passion. The dramatic shorthand Brooks deploys in “Ella McCay” might seem jarring relative to modern Hollywood offerings. But there's an inevitable awkwardness watching present-day actors attempt to do the same. Still, most of them do fairly well with on-paper stock characters, either serviced by Brooks's direction or keen editing. Kumail Nanjiani plays an accommodating driver/sounding board in scenes that feel slightly sitcommy but are designed to recall similar scenes where heroes confide with their put-upon domestic help, e.g., butlers or doormen, from early Hollywood. In a daring, roughly five-minute scene, Ella's brother convinces his ex-girlfriend (Ayo Edibiri) to get back together with him after not seeing each other for 18 months. But Brooks's trust in his actors actually pays off dividends here, even if the writing feels forced. A strain of Frank Capra optimism runs through “Ella McCay” that will either wash as simplistic or charming. The scandal that threatens her career involves carving out time for a personal life. Some of these details would probably seem too Pollyannish for a fantasy like “The West Wing,” but they make sense in the fanciful world Brooks creates, which is one where people win even when they lose, and villains seem down to Earth even when their comeuppance doesn't. Brooks's years honing his craft writing prickly characters and witty repartee ensures that not all of this scans as mindless escapism. It goes without saying that some scenes are misjudged in terms of tone and length. Certain characters, particularly a rough-around-the-edges aunt played by Jamie Lee Curtis, feel like first-draft ideas that nevertheless persisted. However, what smooths out these bumps in the road is Brooks ability to still write an earnest speech or button a scene with a snarky rejoinder. Watching “Ella McCay” can sometimes feel like time travel, particularly for those vested in bygone eras of American filmmaking, but if you're capable of tuning into its wavelength, an old but worthwhile spirit can be found. 20th Century Studios will release “Ella McCay” in theaters on Friday, December 12.

Taylor Swift is celebrating the end of an era with the people who made it all possible.

On Tuesday in New York, the “Life of a Showgirl” songwriter held an intimate advance screening of the first two episodes of her upcoming six-episode Disney+ docuseries, “The End of an Era,” where she described her nearly two-year-long, 149-show Eras Tour as “a lifetime within my lifetime.”

Clad in a ribbed black turtleneck, pleated miniskirt and knee-high heeled boots, the woman of the hour addressed her guests before the projectors started rolling.

“There's a lot of magic and mystery that happens when something goes as well as this [tour] did,” Swift told the crowd, which included her Eras dancers, backup singers, choreographers, band members and styling team. (Packs of tissues were thoughtfully placed near their seats in anticipation of the doc's more emotional scenes.)

The superstar's family (parents Scott and Andrea Swift and brother Austin) were also at the special event, as were a few media friends including Gayle King, Robin Roberts and Hoda Kotb. Swift sat with her dancers during the screening, and stuck around afterward to personally greet everyone who attended.

The first two episodes of “The End of an Era,” which documents the making of the musician's record-smashing tour, will begin streaming on Disney+ starting Friday, Dec. 12 at 12 a.m. PT — one day before Swift's 36th birthday. 

The next two episodes will arrive the following Friday, Dec. 19, and the final two on Dec. 26.

Starting Dec. 12 at 12 a.m. PT, fans can also stream “Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The Final Show,” a concert film recorded at Swift's final Eras performance in Vancouver on Dec. 8, 2024.

Unlike “Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour,” the movie she released in 2023, this updated cut includes the “Tortured Poets Department” section of the show, which Swift added to her 3.5-hour set midway through her tour.

(Although she'll probably pull on something a little bit fancier for the 2026 Met Gala.) As announced Wednesday morning (Dec. 10), the pop superstar will helm the 2026 event alongside Oscar winner Nicole Kidman and tennis champion Venus Williams, with Vogue posting a video on Instagram set to Claude DeBussey's “Claire de Lune” displaying their names. The graphic of a white curtain drifting elegantly against a marble wall also spells out next year's Met theme: “Costume Art.” In addition to the chairs and theme, Vogue revealed on its website that Anthony Vaccarello and Zoë Kravitz will lead the 2026 Met Gala Host Committee, which so far includes members Sabrina Carpenter, LISA of BLACKPINK, Doja Cat, Gwendoline Christie, Alex Consani, Misty Copeland, Elizabeth Debicki, Lena Dunham, Paloma Elsesser, Chloe Malle, Sam Smith, Teyana Taylor, Lauren Wasser, Anna Weyant, A'ja Wilson and Yseult. That year, she matched the “Manus x Machina” theme in a beaded peach Givenchy Haute Couture gown. In 2014, Bey wore an elegant black design with netting draped over eyes for the “Charles James: Beyond Fashion” installment, and in 2013, she stunned in an intricate, black-and-gold gown with matching boots for “Punk: Chaos to Couture.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Billboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

It seems like they hardly know each other—despite a very funny Zoe Winters insisting otherwise while trying to get them to pose—and uncomfortable around each other. “We had a scene together that was driving me crazy. I was desperately looking for its meaning, writing pages and pages of textual analysis,” Pattinson said earlier this year (via The Independent). I shared my doubts with her, I spoke for two hours, and after a while, very calmly, she made me understand that the line just said what it meant to say, that there was no hidden meaning.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Nothing prepares you for this,” Bublé wrote on December 10 over a social media video of him as a child on the day of his First Communion, and then at the Vatican decades later, speaking to Pope Leo. In the caption of his December 10 post, Bublé wrote, “Trying to put this past weekend into words feels almost impossible. God has quietly remained at the center of everything I do and when I look back on my life and career, I can see his hand in all of it: in my family, my friends, everyone I've worked with, and in all of you.” On December 8, Bublé shared a carousel of photos from the special day, beginning with one of himself with his wife, Luisana Lopilato, and his parents at the Vatican, writing, “Standing before His Holiness, Pope Leo XIV, alongside my wife Lu, my parents and my friends was an experience beyond anything we could have dreamed of. To share a few moments with someone whose kindness, humility, and compassion have touched so many was truly unforgettable. Lopilato also posted about the experience on December 8, writing that “it was a moment full of emotion… but also full of pride. After returning to the U.S., Daly shared that Bublé invited him and his wife Siri to accompany his family to the Vatican, writing in an essay for NBC that he and Bublé “share not only the love of music, but also a deep Catholic faith.” It was without a doubt one of the best and most inspiring music events I've ever witnessed.” Daly and Bublé will be back in Los Angeles together on December 15 and 16 for the season 28 finale of “The Voice.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The band's co-founder issued a rare mea culpa after weighing in with his theories about what caused the former KISS guitarist's death at 74 in October. Gene Simmons has offered a mea culpa for his hurtful theory on what caused the death of his beloved late KISS bandmate guitarist Ace Frehley. The rare retraction from the bassist/singer known for his bombastic, no-filter statements came after Simmons, 76, ruffled some feathers by claiming that “bad decisions” caused Frehley's death at 74 in October. Falling down the stairs — I'm not a doctor — doesn't kill you. There may have been other issues, and it breaks my heart,” Simmons reportedly told The New York Post following Frehley's death, which was attributed to injuries suffered during a fall the month prior. Watch Danny Ocean Sing at the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony Honoring Venezuela's María Corina Machado In This Season of Giving, Mariah Carey Shares Throwback Clip From 1994 Manifesting a Potential Christmas Classic One Day: 'So Grateful' At the time, Simmons appeared to suggest that Frehley's death was possibly tied to the guitarist's long struggle with alcoholism, despite Ace reportedly being sober for more than 20 years before his death. But, upon reflection, and following some backlash from fans at what they deemed an unkind final gesture from the teetotaling bassist, Simmons respectfully walked back his earlier statements. “My hand to God I didn't intend to hurt Ace or his legacy but upon rereading my words, I see how it hurt everyone,” Simmons wrote. At the time of his death, Frehley's family issued a statement that read: “We are completely devastated and heartbroken. In his last moments, we were fortunate enough to have been able to surround him with loving, caring, peaceful words, thoughts, prayers and intentions as he left this earth. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band also remembered their founding guitarist, who they called the “essential and irreplaceable rock solider,” adding, “We are devastated by the passing of Ace Frehley. He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history. He is and will always be a part of KISS's legacy. Simmons issued his own personal post on X as well, writing, “Our hearts are broken. Sadder still, Ace didn't live long enough to be honored at the Kennedy Ctr Honors event in Dec. Frehley co-founded KISS with Simmons, singer/guitarist Paul Stanley and drummer Peter Criss, performing with the band from 1973-1982, before leaving for more than a decade, then returning in 1996 for a reunion tour through 2002. My hand to God i didn't intended to hurt Ace or his legacy but upon rereading my words, I see how it hurt everyone.

Like pretty much everything Fuller creates, be it Hannibal, American Gods, or Dead Like Me, Pushing Daisies has developed a strong cult following over the years, and speaking directly to them through a medium (in this case, ComicBook.com), Fuller says he “absolutely” wants to do another season. “We have a season three pitch, and the entire cast wants to come back, and we're hoping we get to return to them,” Fuller said. Pushing Daisies starred Pace as Ned, the head baker and proprietor of the Pie Hole. Can Lee Pace resurrect a TV show with the power of his touch? If so, why hasn't he done it for Halt And Catch Fire?

It's a rare moment of rest for a performer who doesn't, by his own admission, know how to not give everything 100 percent. Yungblud's spent much of this last year touring, and he'll spend much of 2026 doing the same. He released a full-length album, Idols, in June and recently teamed up with Aerosmith for a joint EP, One More Time, that was released in November. In between tours and album releases, Yungblud put on his second year of Bludfest, a U.K. music festival aimed at being accessible and inclusive for all fans. Craig Kallman to Leave Atlantic Records For New Role As Chief Music Officer at Warner Music (Exclusive) Diddy's Mom Joins His Lawyers, Biggie Smalls' Estate to Blast "Lies" in Docuseries The grueling schedule is impressive but presumably takes a toll on any performer. Days before this conversation, Yungblud announced to his fans on social media that he was canceling a handful of shows that remained in 2025 at the suggestion of his doctor. The rocker assures that overall he's doing OK. Idols has been a career-defining moment for the Doncaster, U.K., native — one of several throughout 2025. The album brought him two Grammy nominations in the best rock album and best rock song categories. His third Grammy nomination came from a moment that very well might've changed the course of his career: his live performance of Black Sabbath's “Changes” at the Back to the Beginning benefit concert, honoring the late Ozzy Osbourne and serving as his last show. “That was probably the moment — I think it was bubbling — but I think the world started paying attention after that,” Yungblud tells The Hollywood Reporter. The live performance, recorded for the upcoming concert film, Back To The Beginning: Ozzy's Final Bow, earned Yungblud and his fellow collaborators a nomination for best rock performance. It's a special nomination for many reasons; first, due to the fact that a live recording was nominated, and second, due to Yungblud's own personal relationship with his late idol, with whom he'd grown close with in recent years. Below, the British rocker speaks with THR about finally making the album he wanted to make with Idols, wrapping his head around scoring three Grammy nominations and how he's feeling after his health-related show cancellations. At the start of this year, I was filming a [music] video in the Bulgarian snow for “Hello Heaven, [Hello],” and now I'm sat here. It's been the craziest year of my life, so I think I'm just trying to catch it all. It's been wild to end the year with what looks like two No. 1 albums in the U.K. My first number one in America, three Grammy nominations and 400,000 tickets sold has just been like, whoa. What does it mean to get this recognition? What's cool about the Grammys is [it's] from your peers. I think in the past, the internet or music critics have had a lot to say about me. But when you get, I don't know, recognized or even noticed by your peers — the people who write music, produce music, play music — that's a cool thing. Any musician starts as a fan first, don't we? When you're a fan of other people's work, it's cool. This year, a lot of my heroes have kind of hit me up [told me they] really loved what [I] did. As a result of that, I really went away and wanted to make a piece of music and a body of work that would be such an adventure and would be so off the wall and so against the rules of modern music. I just wanted to take a risk, even if it was the end of my career. I think that's how rock music's supposed to be made. It's been amazing to arrive at this destination at the end of the biggest risk of my life. I had an idea, that I thought would be great, and to see people respond to it is really cool. Something has obviously shifted for you in terms of mainstream perception lately. Does it feel almost like a vindication knowing that this is the music you've been wanting to make, and it's working out? I think that's always the case isn't it? You watch any documentary of any great musician that you love and they go, “I finally did what I wanted, and it all worked.” It's so crazy. As artists, we go and do all this shit and experiment and listen to other people because every single great artist in every documentary tells us that they did that. Then they flip the switch, and it all worked. You've got to be running away from something to realize that you're running towards something also. I'm truly myself right now, so people can formulate a decision whether they like me or not. Some kind of mainstream recognition has come across me. I've heard you say in interviews that you don't get to pick how people perceive you, and that's something I ask nearly every artist I speak with. This album, it's been amazing and the music I'm about to make is going to be a continuation of what I just made. I think people have been deterring me from doing rock music for forever because it's not been around for years. It's not been around for 15 years minimum. I've got to make what my fucking soul wants to make, even if it is the end of my professional career, because I can't handle the fact that I am… It's the most frustrating thing in the world when you can't go the full way. You want to run the whole way. I'm sure it helps in terms of authenticity and creativity. If you make a fucking record from your soul and your heart and people hate it, you can't really do much about it. Yeah, man, it's like you fucking explode. He goes in his verse, “Yeah, I am from a fucking trailer and you did fuck my mom.” Then the guy has nothing to burn him on. He's just like, this is who I am. When you can kind of have the courage to do that, then nothing can burn because you've already laid it all on the table. To go back to the Grammys for a second, how are you feeling about the fact that “Changes” got a nomination? I assume that's a pretty special feeling for you at this moment in time. That was probably the moment — I think it was bubbling — but I think the world started paying attention after that. It's so amazing that it got nominated for rock performance, as actually the only live performance in the category. I think it's cool that something has got critically acclaimed for me, just telling the guy who got me into music and started everything for me that I love him. I knew it was magic, and I knew that we came together — it's such a crazy moment. Half of 'em were probably wondering why the fuck I was there, or some of them probably didn't like me. That concert brought six generations of rock fans together, and I think it was the first time people had something in common with me. Like, oh, fuck, man, [he] just likes Sabbath. I just tried to give it everything. It was the first moment that I've ever… I'm fucking riddled with ADHD, so when you're standing on stage with 20,000 people, you're like, oh look, there's a sign there and oh, there's a girl on her shoulders' there. You're seeing a million things in lights. It's like an ADHD person's fucking nightmare. It was the first time I've ever sung a piece of music to one person. In front of such a large audience too. I was like, I'm just going to really reach down to the depths of an incredible song and the depths of my very being and try to make something magic out of it. It was a moment in time that happened, and it could never have been the same again. You've been very open about your own mental health and your struggle with finding your own identity, which can be a bit of a taboo thing in rock. Why was it so important to you? Since the beginning of my career — I'm very bubbly and light, but I'm extremely dark inside my head. That is what captured a generation's imagination. The murmurs of school and the pressures of everything where you can't truly say how you feel, but then someone does it on the internet and another person does it on the internet and then it starts to become a normal thing. I think inevitably art is written about the world that we're living in. I just feel like it was needed. I'd watched Chris Cornell; I'd watched Chester [Bennington]; I'd watched Kurt Cobain and had watched Amy Winehouse, and how sad is it that a time wouldn't allow them to have an outlet to potentially talk about what was going on in their head. It's about 2018, 2019 when it started to be normal to be like, yo, I don't think I'm OK. Or be normal to be like, I need to take a break from touring for a second. I think it's so sad that those artists had to face that and be up against the mood of the world. It's the one thing I know that's real. In the same way that we sing about something that's tangibly so emotionally overwhelming, anxiety, depression and a feeling being overwhelmed and exhaustion is also that kind of thing. You're very busy with touring, and unfortunately, you had to cancel some shows at the end of the year. How do you take care of yourself in that way? I think the fundamentally cool thing about me and my fanbase is I am completely honest with them. I basically just went and had some tests done, and I'm showing early signs of exhaustion in my voice. My doctor, I've known him for a long time, since I've been very young, he's said it's finally to a place where I need to start taking this seriously. [I'm] not just a 17-year-old young punk anymore who can do a shot of whiskey and say fuck it. I want to be the best for my community. I have a big touring year next year, so I just made the decision that we were obviously going to play support to [Limp] Bizkit and [at] festivals. My doctor just [didn't] want [me] on planes and playing shows over two hours right now. He [said] if [I] want to write songs or want to kind of decompress and hit the studio, [he] said he'd have no issue with that.
