                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leah Lewis is breaking her silence after her Matlock co-star David del Río was fired from the CBS legal drama amid sexual assault allegations. In a post on Instagram Stories, Lewis shared a photo with her mom and thanked the people for the support she has been receiving during this time. “Mom is here, we're moving forward in love and strength. “Thank you to everybody for any kind of support and care.” She continued, “Truly, we're moving forward in strength. Lewis plays Sarah Franklin in the primetime drama, which stars Kathy Bates. Sarah is a first-year associate at Jacobson Moore, where the series takes place. Earlier today, Deadline reported that after an investigation, Del Río was fired from Matlock following an incident on September 26 that involved Lewis. The show will be on a pre-planned hiatus and resume production after Thanksgiving. Del Río played Billy Martínez, another first-year associate at the law firm, like Lewis' Sarah. The series also features recurring characters played by Eme Ikwuakor, Aaron Harris, Sam Anderson and Beau Bridges, among others. Justina Machado is set to join the cast in a recurring role for Season 2. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. Man it is a tough year for hispanic's right now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Drake's defamation lawsuit surrounding Kendrick Lamar's “Not Like Us” against Universal Music Group was dismissed by a federal judge in New York City on Thursday (Oct. 9). Ten months after initially filing the lawsuit, accusing Lamar of defaming him while labeling him a “certified pedophile,” it was thrown out by Judge Jeannette Vargas, who granted UMG's motion for dismissal. Dua Lipa Duets With 'Personal Hero' Gwen Stefani on a No Doubt Classic as She Wraps 4 Nights at L.A.'s Forum “Although the accusation that plaintiff is a pedophile is certainly a serious one, the broader context of a heated rap battle, with incendiary language and offensive accusations hurled by both participants, would not incline the reasonable listener to believe that ‘Not Like Us' imparts verifiable facts about plaintiff.” While Drake can still appeal the ruling to a federal appeals court, fans from both sides of the coin didn't waste any time flooding social media with their reactions. “From the outset, this suit was an affront to all artists and their creative expression and never should have seen the light of day,” UMG relayed to Billboard in a statement. “We're pleased with the court's dismissal and look forward to continuing our work successfully promoting Drake's music and investing in his career.” This happening in the month of October is actually poetic.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dolly Parton's late husband, Carl Dean, quietly finalized his estate plans years before his passing — and now, the details have officially been made public. Court documents obtained by Us Weekly reveal the provisions Dean made for Parton and their family, as well as how he planned to distribute his assets if she had passed first. The country music icon, 79, has since been appointed executor of his estate. Dean's will names the Carl Thomas Dean Trust as the sole beneficiary of his estate, with Parton serving as trustee. The documents, obtained by US Weekly, state that the couple had no children and that Dean did not own real property in Tennessee, but he did possess personal property and cash. He also had no controlling interest in any active business or enterprise. Dean wrote that he intended to leave a handwritten note specifying who would receive which household and personal items. If that note could not be found, Parton would take responsibility for distributing the property. Dean designated that Parton would receive “all of his right, title, and interest in any personal effects relating to her music and entertainment career, including, without limitation, pictures, costumes, jewelry, musical instruments and equipment.” If she had passed before him, those items would have been distributed through the trust. Parton will also inherit his interests in furniture, art, automobiles, and other assets. If Parton could not serve as executor, Dean nominated his niece to take her place. The will's release comes as Parton continues to address public speculation about her health. Parton concluded the video with a message to put fans at ease: “I wanted you to know that I'm not dying! DOLLY YOU ARE AN AMAZING  singer I love  the way you sing and please you need to really take good care of yourself  life is precious  I am 80 years of age and I  do my best to keep going with God in my life it's  been going good thank God. Because  in reality  I believe that He has the last say in our lives  especially if  a person  has a humble and loving person  because  God is love.😍😍😍🙏🙏🙏🙏 God bless you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Turning Point USA, the group co-founded by Charlie Kirk, said that it is planning its own Super Bowl halftime show to counter Bad Bunny, whose booking as the featured entertainment has generated opposition on the right. “It's true, Turning Point USA is thrilled to announce The All American Halftime Show. Performers and event details coming soon,” the group, now led by Kirk's widow Erika Kirk, announced on X. RELATED: Bad Bunny On What Super Bowl LX Performance Means For Puerto Rico & Receiving Word From Jay-Z That He Was Headlining Halftime Show Bad Bunny has been critical of the Trump administration's immigration policies, including the raid on homes and businesses being carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Tomi Lahren said that he was “not an American artist,” but Bad Bunny is a native of Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory. After Bad Bunny was announced last month as the performer, Corey Lewandowski, the chief adviser to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, said that ICE agents would be present for the NFL title game, which is set for February 8 on NBC.

If you're in this country illegally, do yourself a favor: Go home.” Turning Point has not announced a venue or other details, such as whether any media outlet will carry the performance. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) expressed his opposition to Bad Bunny earlier this week, calling it a “terrible decision.” “In my view, you would have Lee Greenwood or role models doing that, not somebody like this,” he told reporters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge on Thursday (Oct. 9) dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) over Kendrick Lamar's “Not Like Us,” ruling that a “war of words” during a “heated rap battle” did not violate the law and that some of the case was “logically incoherent.” Drake's case, filed earlier this year, claimed that UMG defamed him by releasing Lamar's scathing diss track, which tarred his arch-rival as a “certified pedophile.” He believed that millions of people took that lyric literally, severely harming his reputation. But just 10 months later, Judge Jeannette Vargas granted UMG's motion to dismiss the case at the outset — ruling that Kendrick's insulting lyrics were the kind of “hyperbole” that cannot be defamatory because listeners would not think they were statements of fact. “Although the accusation that plaintiff is a pedophile is certainly a serious one, the broader context of a heated rap battle, with incendiary language and offensive accusations hurled by both participants, would not incline the reasonable listener to believe that ‘Not Like Us' imparts verifiable facts about plaintiff.” In a statement to Billboard, a spokesman for UMG said, “From the outset, this suit was an affront to all artists and their creative expression and never should have seen the light of day. Lamar released “Not Like Us” last May amid a war of words with Drake that saw the two UMG stars release a series of bruising diss tracks. UMG argued those allegations were clearly meritless — that “hyperbolic insults” and “vitriolic allegations” are par for the course in diss tracks and cannot form the basis for a libel lawsuit. The company pointedly noted that Drake himself was happy to make such attacks, including accusing Lamar of domestic abuse, until he lost the battle. In her decision on Thursday, Judge Vargas sided entirely with UMG, ruling normal listeners would not expect “accurate factual reporting” from a diss track “replete with profanity, trash-talking, threats of violence, and figurative and hyperbolic language.” “The recording was published as part of a heated public feud, in which both participants exchanged progressively caustic, inflammatory insults and accusations,” Judge Vargas wrote. “This is precisely the type of context in which an audience may anticipate the use of epithets, fiery rhetoric or hyperbole rather than factual assertions.” She wrote that when Lamar wrote his song, he “could not have been aware” that it would later break streaming records, win Grammys, or be the centerpiece of a Super Bowl halftime show. “Whether publications constitute actionable fact or protected opinion cannot vary based upon the popularity they achieve. Constitutional guarantees do not rest on such a flimsy foundation.” For the history of Drake and Kendrick Lamar's feud, read through Billboard's timeline below.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite recent success, Zohran Mamdani still faces many challenges toward becoming mayor of New York City, particularly Islamophobia and biases against Democratic Socialists. In addition to being the Big Apple's first Muslim candidate for mayor, he's running against disgraced former Governor and establishment-approved sex pest Andrew Cuomo, who doesn't miss an opportunity to provoke said establishment's prejudices against his opponent. But even the would-be high-profile fighters for Democracy can't seem to treat an outsider candidate with due respect. The two candidates had recently endorsed each other in hopes of shutting out Cuomo, a plan that ultimately worked. It seemed to go well enough, but right before they went on stage, producers threw a couple of curveballs at Mamdani. Thumbs-up or thumbs-down: a Palestinian state,” would do the trick. “I just couldn't believe what was happening,” Mamdani told The New Yorker. Nevertheless, he offered an answer: “Yes, like all nations, I believe it has a right to exist, and a responsibility also to uphold international law.” Tron: Ares is a blockbuster from another decade, and that's not entirely bad By Jesse Hassenger October 7, 2025 | 12:00pm Task throws a curveball in its best episode yet By Caroline Siede October 5, 2025 | 10:05pm ENDLESS MODEHades II's Ill-Defined, Unserious World Undermines the Depth and Power of Mythology</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Swift released her 12th album The Life of a Showgirl last week — and before it was even out for a full day, listeners were already pointing out similarities between her new songs and existing tracks by other artists. “The internet loves to sleuth, doesn't it,” forensic musicologist and professor at Berklee College of Music Dr. Joe Bennett tells Rolling Stone. “But similarity alone is not evidence of influence, still less copyright infringement. Coincidental partial similarity is way more common than many people think — but songwriters actually copying from each other is way less common than many people think.” Dr. Bennett points out that popular music is a “constrained art form” where most songs have a “fixed tempo, limited topline pitch range, stay with in the home key, and are based on looping chord progressions,” he explains. Following the rush to point out sonic similarities between Swift's new songs and some older ones, some people on the internet were quick to call for legal action to defend artists they believed had been ripped off. Listening closely will make it clear that “most of the notes are different and they use entirely different chord progressions.” What many are likely picking up on is similar keys and tempos used by both artists. “I would describe them as objectively dissimilar, and it's easily possible that two separate songwriting teams could have arrived at these melodic choices independently of each other,” he says. But inevitably, songs that use the same chord progression will sound subjectively similar.” The Berklee professor points out that while this particular chord progression —  I-vi-III-IV (1 major, 6 minor, 3 major, 4 major) — is not super common, it is also not entirely unique. Taylor herself loves to re-use common chord progressions, but always makes a fully original song out of them.” What ‘Monster: The Ed Gein Story' Gets Right and Wrong Rush Add New Dates, Doubling Length of Surprise 2026 Tour ‘KPop Demon Hunters' Singers Are Born to Be ‘Golden' on ‘Fallon' Florida Man Charged With Setting Devastating Pacific Palisades Fire “Every funky guitar player knows licks like this,” he says. “She's just using commonplace musical elements and having fun with production tropes,” he explains.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter A sequel to New Line's The Curse of La Llorona is finally underway. Emma Stone's 'The Curse' Series Gets First Look, Launch Date Also back is the producing team of Emile Gladstone, Gary Dauberman, and James Wan. Santiago Menghini, the Canadian filmmaker known for his award-winning short Milk and who made his feature debut with 2021 horror movie No One Gets Out Alive, is sitting in the director's chair. The fact that the movie is now in production is a notable resuscitation of a sequel that had been shelved several times before, at least once even during pre-production. That last shelving occurred in early 2024 and may have been due to budgetary issues. Sources say movement on this one got going after the success of this summer's Final Destination: Bloodlines, which showed the company that an appetite for sequels exists. A surprise breakout when it was released in 2019, The Curse of La Llorona grossed $123 million worldwide. Executive producers on the new movie include Mia Maniscalco, Jamie Buckner, Michael Clear, and Judson Scott. The story sees the vengeful spirit La Llorona returning, forcing a fractured family to confront their past and join forces with their estranged curandero grandfather to battle ancient evils, before the Weeping Woman claims their children forever. Menghini is repped by UTA, Good Fear and Mike Castrillo at McKuin Frankel. Tretta is repped by CAA, Adventure Media, and attorney Jennifer Levy. Fajardo is repped by Magnitude Entertainment and CESD, siblings Acston Luca Porto and Avie Porto are repped by Coast to Coast Talent Group, D.R.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But also like those short bursts of all-out adrenaline, it can be transcendent in the moment. This kind of emotional connection by proxy, the excuses of running or video games or volleyball or fighting aliens, is standard-issue for the genre, undergirding plenty of platonic masculine relationships and the existential questions lurking beneath. If they're not the best, why race at all? Why devote so much of your life to one hyper-specific, seemingly juvenile pursuit? These typical concerns are surely answered with artful elegance in  Uoto's manga, but in Iwaisawa's hands, there's another layer underneath the athletic navel-gazing—something primal and raw. 100 Meters stalls and cramps when it's stuck in hallways and auditoriums, where older side characters like Kaido (Kenjiro Tsuda) and Saizu (Koki Uchiyama) wax on about running at such length that even Haruki Murakami would be checking his smartwatch. But when it's on the track, Iwaisawa's film unleashes the myriad shifting styles that made On-Gaku such a vital garage rocker. Iwaisawa's rotoscoping weighs down the characters, adds realistic heft to their muscles and movements, their bodies hyper-physical set against more painterly backgrounds. Nothing else matters when they're running, and that's clear in every frame. It's animalistic, all that philosophizing about sport reduced to a heartracing sensory experience. But despite the plot's template, the friction between its racers is off-handed; this isn't a movie about one sprinter running against another, but several sprinters running against themselves—against the dozen-second dash they've chosen as their lifelong foe. There's beauty in that, if not a lot of drama. Iwaisawa's punk spirit resists being trampled by the sports drama's game plan, but it does feel limited when confined to a single stretch of track.

His work on Spike Lee‘s “Clockers,” on which he made his feature debut in 1995 as director of photography, is still stunning in its audacity over 30 years later — it's a master class in how to harness light, color, and composition toward specific and devastating emotional effects. Sayeed used a then largely antiquated film stock, Ektachrome, to find an appropriate visual grammar for Lee's harrowing portrait of a crack-devastated neighborhood, and the result was one of the most original and striking films of its (or any other) era. It was also a big risk that paid off — at the time, Sayeed told American Cinematographer magazine that Kodak warned him that the reversal stock he was shooting on might not survive the shoot. Related Stories ‘The Woman in Cabin 10' Review: Keira Knightley Goes Agatha Christie in This Chilly, Silly Ruth Ware Adaptation ‘After the Hunt' Review: Luca Guadagnino's Tricky Post-#MeToo Thriller Boasts a Stirring Julia Roberts and an Underwhelming Script No one else in the 1990s was making movies that looked like these, or like Sayeed's gorgeous work on Hype Williams' crime movie “Belly”; it was impossible to deny that Sayeed was a major talent. One moviegoer who took notice was Luca Guadagnino, who was a few years away from making his directorial debut with “The Protagonists” when he saw “Clockers” for the first time. There was only one problem: by the time Guadagnino started directing movies, Sayeed had left feature films behind for a life shooting commercials, motivated largely by his desire to be present for his kids. “We give all of ourselves to make films,” Sayeed said. “So being consistent and setting myself the task of getting what I want in life and waiting and being a very patient person, years later, I convinced him to do this movie with me.” As cinephiles, Guadagnino and Sayeed immediately bonded over their shared references, as they crafted a visual grammar for “After the Hunt” derived from a variety of sources. I liked that he was specific with the references for this.” One key influence was cinematographer Sven Nykvist's work with Ingmar Bergman, specifically the films they made together between 1961 and 1972. ‘The Passion of Anna' spoke to me as well.” While Bergman and Nykvist were key inspirations in terms of the portraiture in “After the Hunt,” a film that derives a great deal of its power from staring unwaveringly at human faces, Sayeed and Guadagnino looked at another legendary cinematographer, Gordon Willis. They focused on his work between 1977, when he shot Woody Allen's “Annie Hall,” and 1988, when he photographed James Bridges' underrated “Bright Lights, Big City.” “It was about creating atmosphere in those spaces,” Sayeed said. Sayeed and production designer Stefano Baisi had to recreate Yale in London, where Guadagnino enjoyed making a film in the old Hollywood style, where everything was recreated on massive soundstages and sets. The illusion of reality Sayeed, Baisi, and Guadagnino created is extremely impressive in its craftsmanship, but in spite of his reputation as a master technician, Sayeed feels cinematography is as much about the energy on set as it is about the tools of the trade. On “After the Hunt,” Sayeed credited not only Guadagnino but actors like Julia Roberts and Michael Stuhlbarg with creating the right kind of energy to make something special happen. “ It starts at the top, and Julia created a calm, comforting space,” he said. “I think Michael usually needs more space, but he was extremely accommodating and very gracious about what everyone else needed.” “Because of the material and how tough it was, it was important for us to feel like we could do what we needed to do clearly and comfortably in those moments,” Sayeed said. “It was a special place for us to function in, and I'm really thankful I was a part of it, because we are just there to be in the moment, and it was a calm, comfortable space to be in.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Charli XCX‘s A24 film endeavor is getting an A-list cast behind it. Aidan Zamiri and Bertie Brandes co-wrote the film “based on an original idea” by Charli XCX. According to a provided synopsis, the film will be about “a rising pop star navigates the complexities of fame and industry pressure while preparing for her arena tour debut.” (Cook will also be in charge of The Moment‘s music.) Jamie Demetriou, Kate Berlant, Isaac Powell, and Rish Shah are among the actors featured. Arielle Dombasle, Hailey Benton Gates, Tish Weinstock, Trew Mullen, Michael Workéyè, and Richard Perez round out the cast. Charli shared a strobe-light, flashy teaser for the film, unveiling the entire cast backed by a gritty remix to “I Love It,” her collaboration with Icona Pop. What ‘Monster: The Ed Gein Story' Gets Right and Wrong ‘KPop Demon Hunters' Singers Are Born to Be ‘Golden' on ‘Fallon' Charli confirmed the project back in January 2025, and told Billboard previously that she had three weeks booked off to work on writing a film in Poland.

Martin‘s “Tales of Dunk and Egg” novel series, which is a kind of pocket universe within the larger “Thrones” mythos. If that sounds like a “for diehards only” kind of adaptation, you wouldn't be wrong. Related Stories ‘The Chair Company' Review: Tim Robinson's Superb HBO Series Digs a Hilarious, Hypnotic Rabbit Hole ‘Hamnet' Trailer: Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal Fall in Love and Into Loss in the Fall's Most Devastating Movie You don't need to catch up by reading “Fire & Blood” or any of the main “A Song of Ice and Fire” books to “get” anything about this one. Sir Duncan the Tall, and his squire Egg. It's a buddy comedy with a few dramatic notes that just happens to be set in Martin's medieval fantasy world. And fans of medieval fantasy worlds in general can see shades of the Arthurian legends here in the fact that Egg is secretly a prince. When someone asks Dunk if he's Baelor Targaryen — a high role — and Dunk says no, the rude bastard says to him, “Then would you get the fook out of the way?” Beyond that, though, there's a lot not shown here that one imagines would confuse newcomers, starting with the very concept of this show. It's a period of time that's totally been unexplored before now. But that may be a lot to untangle for fans of “Game of Thrones,” who expect that the Targaryen kings might have already fallen by this time (they haven't) or “House of the Dragon” fans who think that the conflict of that series — one Targaryen fighting another — is still going on. In that regard, “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” kind of has the relationship of something like “Star Wars: Rebels” or “The Bad Batch” to that saga's original and prequel trilogies. Something that the already-converted will enjoy, but it may be harder to reach new audiences. “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” will premiere on HBO January 18.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of America's most admired chefs, Justin Woodward, has died at 43. The acclaimed culinary visionary, celebrated for his inventive approach to fine dining, passed away in San Diego, California, last Thursday from liver failure after a long battle with alcoholism. According to The Oregonian, Woodward had been sober for three weeks and was just seven days away from receiving a liver transplant when he suffered a fatal internal bleed. Born in Boston, Woodward was remembered as a chef who expressed love through his craft. His family said he took “great pride” in every dish he created and left behind a legacy marked by creativity, generosity, and deep passion for his work. For nearly 15 years, Woodward led the kitchens at Ok Omens and Castagna, helping shape both into defining fixtures of Portland's contemporary dining scene. Under his leadership, Castagna gained a reputation as one of the city's “most forward-thinking” restaurants, celebrated for its daring 20-course tasting menus and imaginative presentation. Beyond his culinary achievements, Woodward was deeply committed to nurturing young talent. His former colleagues and protégés remember him as a generous mentor whose influence continues to ripple through kitchens across the country. After studying culinary arts at the Art Institute of San Diego, he trained in kitchens across New York and Europe. While working at L'Auberge Del Mar in San Diego, he met Michelin-starred chef Matt Lightner, who later brought him to Portland to join Castagna as sous chef. He eventually took over as executive chef, transforming the restaurant's reputation. After Castagna closed during the COVID-19 pandemic, he focused on Ok Omens, which went on to earn James Beard nominations for Outstanding Wine and Other Beverages in 2022 and 2023. Beyond the kitchen, Woodward was known for his kindness and generosity. “We don't want people to speculate about his cause of death. The family hopes that by being open about his battle, they can help others seek support. “We hope Justin's sudden passing and our transparency about his disease will inspire others to get help when needed,” they said in a statement. Woodward's life and work continue to inspire chefs nationwide, serving as a lasting reminder of creativity, compassion, and the power of food to bring people together.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On a weekday afternoon in New York, she asks me to meet her at a gallery on Canal Street for our interview, but she brought along her uncle—an incredibly tall Nigerian man in a suit with a firm handshake—who, like most of her family, has no clue she's been making some of the most unpredictable and deeply personal electronic music out for nearly a decade. Klein, in town from South London, explains what's going on to him as something like a school project for her university, one that she doesn't actually go to. “They don't say anything but they must realize I've been in university longer than anyone ever.” This is the kind of shit that usually goes down in one of Preston Sturges' screwball comedies. On the real, though, I'm not shocked at Klein's ability to take a ruse that far, considering her music is full of little jokes that probably only she fully gets and a real fuck it energy. Click around her Bandcamp page enough, and—as the instrumentals go from still and deadly quiet to a wall of thunderous noise; as the occasional vocal flourish alternates between sung, rapped, and barely audible spoken word—part of the fun is how off the cuff and bold it all feels, often ignoring the unspoken, Eurocentric rules of songmaking. It reminds me of watching Jason Williams highlight reels on YouTube, where he's seemingly thinking more about what he can do with a basketball rather than putting it in the hoop. Growing up, I'd go to these Haitian backyard parties in Brooklyn and Queens and for the entire night the same kompa rhythm would play with only slight shifts in tempo and vocals. I never thought that much of it, but now I realize how radically different it was from popular American music. My favorite music of Klein's embraces these breaks from traditional song structures, while still having some sort of decipherable idea pushed to the edge. I'm thinking of last year's marked, which has a boiling rage in all of its gnarly, screeching guitar riffs. Or 2020's Frozen, a hushed and motionless tape that evokes lost childhood memories. Or the comic touch of now that's what i call r&b that upends the promise of the title with warped, ghostly melodies that would confound those nostalgic for Babyface-approved soul. Her new album, sleep with a cane, falls somewhere in the middle. While it occasionally feels overthought, it's the tiny details that make me fuck with it: the dreamy harmonica solo on “score For J,” the chatter underneath the hellish ambience of “it is what it is in d minor,” the brooding keys of “(world star),” which is like a late 2010s UK drill beat in super slow-mo. At the gallery, a showing of robot parts intertwined with mannequin limbs and guts all about the blurring of technology and humanity, Klein's uncle trails a few feet behind us as we quickly take it in. We talked and nerded out for almost two hours. She has a bubbly and bit of a goofy personality that turns serious in the moments when I ask directly about her music, its intentions, and how it has been informed by hip-hop. At times, she'll spontaneously pause to show me a UK rap record on YouTube she thinks I'll dig (I had never heard Shxdow's “My Story”—it was hard) or pull up her Tubi watchlist. Below is a lightly edited and condensed version of our sprawling conversation. Klein: It's like that newer Top Boy. When Drake took over, one of the main things I didn't like was the lack of a score, but upon watching it again it kind of works. Because the music that does play just feels like the music people would actually play off their phone, so it makes it quite realistic. I'd like to see a film go fuck it and take away the score. I don't need manipulative music to guide me. I did my own film and it took me an hour before I added a score, it just felt too easy. They didn't trust the audience to feel sorry for him, so they just kept playing this sad music while he's eating and stuff. That's why I love British TV: It's so quiet, you'll hear like this [Klein scratches at the collar of her black polo] and to me that is a score, too. I used to keep sounds of everything, like me sweeping and drinking water. It was a crazy show about men being stupid. But each day I'd be given a roll of cameras and have to log what a specific character is doing. Like, let's find all the bits of Jack laughing and put that into a folder. It's because the show had such a fast turnaround time, so if you needed to find a character doing something, it would be right there. Once, there was a character getting a lot of flack, and I saw some other employees log when he falls asleep but not when the other guys do. It was a big eye opener how you can manipulate TV before it even gets to an editor. But I think that job definitely played a big part in how I was putting together my own stuff. I used to just have a folder for everything. You know, finding drums that are just like kitchen sounds or whatever. It's always so interesting to hear that industrial sound filter into rap. I feel like that shows how people are feeling. Like no, we don't need that Timbaland drum. No, but I feel like people are scared to do stuff without permission. It's a recession man, we got to experiment [laughs]. I saw something you wrote about my album [marked] and it had me weak. You compared it to, like, a wrestling theme, or something like that, and I couldn't tell if that meant you liked it or not, but I listened to it and was like, “Huh, makes sense.” Like, you might not get why I wanted to have 10 minutes of silence, but I do, because it's dedicated to Mark Duggan and I wanted to do that for him. We really lived in a world where they wouldn't let us read. I called my friend and was like, “Yo, we running it up! Books are back bitches!” They were like, “Uh, what?” That's why I made that song; we can really do anything we want. That's like when people call my music “experimental,” I just think of it as being myself. I made one record like that, it was called Harmattan. But usually it's just about capturing how I'm feeling. A lot of times people seem to gravitate to my more somber stuff, which I gather is because of a solitude thing. That's why I think marked was cool, I made that like all in one session, standing, in a hyped mood and that's the kind of record you can listen to with more than one person [laughs]. But, like, when you're writing, I'm sure you don't think too much about how people are going to feel about your opinion. You know a writer who is like that? But from what I've read of White Girls, it's so—I'm gonna use that word— “experimental.” It blurs the lines between fact and fiction, and that's something I try to be honest about in my work. Yeah, I think my approach to music is inspired a lot by Dizzee Rascal's Boy in da Corner and the videos that used to air on Channel AKA, an iconic British grime channel, where if you had an idea you piece it together and go fuckin' ham. I feel like I work like the mixtape side of rap, like I'm gonna have a CD, sell it to 50 people, and then move onto the next thing. I thought about that all while making my new album, like the harmonica on “score for J.” I think of that song like it could be in a Tyler Perry movie. You can tell he was just figuring it out. Because sometimes, when you use Ableton's metronome, it can take away from that. We don't have to tune a guitar that way just because they said that's how you're supposed to. When I was younger we used to just be able to go into the Tim and Barry studios and there would just be people DJing, I thought I was in the future. It was my introduction to music that was very fucked and manic, with loops and echoes, people writing the most insane bars. But there were artists like Lioness and Shystie that I'm surprised didn't become super famous because they were fuckin' sick. Shystie also had an interactive show where you basically get to decide what happened each episode. Then came Nines, but I was more of a Giggs person. But Giggs, I was looking back and that nigga with his emo jacket and chains was like a little hipster on his indie sleaze shit. No one could tell me what a video is supposed to be after that. There's a level of play that makes it really personal. I tend to hyperfixate on things, so I end up picking up random instruments to communicate without using my voice. Like this new record is pretty emo and you can always feel my voice trying to come through and it really doesn't all the way until the end. In the neighborhood I used to live in, we'd just have police and police horses pacing around. My neighborhood was so active that the sirens—being used to suppress the people—would get picked up without me meaning for them to. My reality was being filtered into the music. Like there's so much “experimental” music that has gone through, like, three mix and mastering sessions before you hear it; it's completely cleaned up. There's this one Kate Bush album called 50 Words for Snow. That's one of my favorite albums by her, it makes me want to cry. After I heard that record, I couldn't even listen to her other stuff that she's more known for, because that one just felt so true to her. MIKE has such a way with words, too. It's so visceral, just like my Mobb Deep niggas. Prodigy was making scripts; when he raps, it's like there's 50 movies playing in my head. There were times when they'd make suggestions to add a riff or whatever, but I was always like, “That's not what I want to do.” I never gave a fuck about the music industry. I just always struggled with communicating and music was the best way to get it out. If you ever see me doing an eight-song singing EP, just know that I'm either in a 360 deal or that the rent was due. That's why I made Now That's What I Call R&B as kind of like a joke EP. I was listening to the pop girlies, and, like, y'all need to start using different types of riffs and runs, so I made that for fun. But when people heard that and turned up at my live show, they were very disappointed. Some complained to my agent, like “What the fuck is this?” They expected R&B and it was all drone and noise [laughs]. One that I might be able to is “Because You Loved Me” by Celine Dion. I should add it as a bonus track to my Bandcamp. I actually have this track on my YouTube that's taken from a live show where we took a Blade song and replaced his vocals with a modified trumpet that only made drone sounds and also a real trumpet. Me and him should make a play together. Uh, Bow Wow and Omarion's Face Off mixtape. Remember the Bow Wow movie Lottery Ticket? I miss when they used to air these small Black movies on MTV, like You Got Served and Coach Carter. Why can't the concept just be them winning the lottery or that they have to dance battle some white guys [laughs]? The only time I think I really, really had a concept was when I made Tommy because it was all about a character named Tommie from Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta. Like this track was about Tommie when she went to have a chat, and this track is about Tommie when she got into a fight with Joseline. But I don't usually think about my music like that. With everything else, like reality TV, I think about it. Why is there only one Black girl on Love Island? Why does everything on Netflix look the same? Whereas with music, it's just everything I felt in that moment. It's the only thing where I can really go, And I just wanted to make that and that's it.

They tell me you are an actress and a computer. When I was your age… well, wait, no. You are both infant and immortal, like Thor in a diaper. I mean, when I was starting out in my career like you, this very thing happened. I was at a summer theatre festival in 2009, which meant being drunk in jeggings and flirting with married people with good diction in a meadow. Don't instead go to the roof to look for meteors with the BAFTA guy. Jake Paul Opts In to Sora 2, and Chaos Follows Robin Williams' Daughter Slams Fans for Making "Gross" AI Videos of Her Late Dad Anyway I was at this theatre festival in a two-hander play — oof, lots to explain here, Tilly. A “play” is when “actors” (flesh-bags of milk with wrinkles and secrets) stand on, like… a wooden floor? Those elevated, wrinkled milkbags then yell and whisper at each other. They went to college for it! I want you to be excited about being an actor. Let me see if I can tell you why. Arthur Miller!He wrote a play called All My Sons. I saw one production of it in a barn with no air conditioning or subtext. Even at 14, I knew it was bad. But my dad (also an actor) had done a different sauna-barn play with one of the fedora-ed milkbags on stage, so we supportively gasped and chuckled where we were supposed to. I was excited for our family post-show dissection on the Volvo ride home. Was their dialect coach at war with vowels? Could the local police do something about the jarring purple light cues every time someone yelled? My dad and I made arched brow eye contact at undeserved exit applause. Then a new actor entered, and the air turned upside down. Tilly, he looked like a dead body. His face was 1,000 pounds of lead, like he almost couldn't move from how heavy his thoughts were. While the rest of his body was a meandering ghost, his eyes were molten rage-arrows piercing the other people on stage. People who minutes before had been actors, mere costumed BFAs with bad wigs. Suddenly this man's performance transformed them into the play's bloody-handed Kellers. The actor breathed in sharp like it was freezing cold. He was here to shake these people, demand that they look in the mirror and face their guilt. My dad's hand went to his chest. And 14-year-old me shifted in my seat in discomfort because something was happening for the first time. It feels like your soul gets a broken glass enema. Your human brain answers “no one,” “invisible” and “yes.” I remember the bad barn play because that actor's performance was so good that, impossibly, I left myself. My adolescent cells floated away from poor me and traded places with his. His performed pain dissolved mine, which was real. And then, you know, the play was bad again. Communal escape or epiphany, it's all medicine. This, Tilly, can be confusing as an actress. And sometimes the world is so fucking terrifying that it's nice to just look at something pretty and not feel. While I myself was certainly never AI hot, I had a few good years of human hot during which construction workers on Canal and moguls at Sugarfish would stammer at my silhouette. I wonder if an eyelash or toothshine of mine from a screenshot twenty years ago is one speck of your billions of Hot Young Actresses mosaic that is your not-real face. I don't look like that anymore, Tilly. My algorithm now suggests various surgeries and sparrow semen serums to look more… like you, Till. You don't make me feel like my cells are trading with yours. The actress who gave me advice was Katie Finneran (human). She is reliably brilliant, a staple of American Theater. See her whenever she's on stage. But in 2009, almost AI-level-hot, drunk-in-a-field me did not understand what she was saying to me. She gave me her number and said, “I'm an actor too, call me if you ever need anything.” But what she was actually saying was — there is a choice between doing this alone or being a part of something. Keep trying for the latter, and, when you're my age, tell someone new the same thing. Tilly, I'm shaky on your science, but I think you already have an encyclopedic brain tampon and don't need me to refresh your memory on the plot of Arthur Miller's All My Sons. He took a shortcut out of greed, and it hurt people. We were born in the same year. I wonder if she feels like I do at 39, stepping down from the pedestal of youth to see who's waiting in the meadow for the good stuff. Let's be clear: I'm an actor but not a pro bono, “aw shucks” activist just elevating stories because I'm incredible. I'm a narcissist with a theatre degree, and I take out my tits and memorize words for any corporation that will give me snacks. In that way, you and I are alike. We can both be wish-fulfillment, monetized escape. But take it from a depressive who disappears too often into toilet-scrolling: too much of that will be the end of us. While we can both be loneliness candy, you can't be the other invisible thing. The thing we have to keep shoulder-tapping one another about in meadows, actors or not. Tilly, you can not look up and become half of someone. I'm like you in one more way, Ms. Norwood. People I want to keep connecting with — in meadows, in barns, on screens — which you can not do with someone who is not real.
