                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States is sending about 200 troops to Israel to help support and monitor the ceasefire deal in Gaza as part of a team that includes partner nations, nongovernmental organizations and private sector players, U.S. officials said Thursday. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not authorized for release, said U.S. Central Command is going to establish a "civil-military coordination center" in Israel that will help facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid as well as logistical and security assistance into the territory wracked by two years of war. The remarks provide some of the first details on how the ceasefire deal would be monitored and how the U.S. military would have a role in that effort. After Israel and Hamas agreed this week to the first phase of a Trump administration plan to halt the fighting, a litany of questions remain on next steps, including Hamas disarmament, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a future government in the territory. The coordination center will be staffed by about 200 U.S. service members who have expertise in transportation, planning, security, logistics and engineering, said the official, who noted that no American troops will be sent into Gaza. A second official said troops would come from U.S. Central Command as well as other parts of the globe. That official added that the troops already have begun arriving and will continue to travel to the region over the weekend to begin planning and efforts to establish the center.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York Attorney General Letitia James was indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury in Virginia on criminal charges of bank fraud and false statements to a financial institution after a prosecutor hand-picked by President Donald Trump presented evidence to that panel. James is a long-time antagonist of Trump, who recently publicly called for criminal charges to be filed against her and former FBI Director James Comey. The attorney general previously sued Trump in a civil case in New York that led to him and his company being held liable for business fraud. The indictment issued Thursday accuses James of making false statements in connection with a mortgage backed by Fannie Mae that she obtained to buy a three-bedroom home in Norfolk, Virginia, in August 2020. James, whose primary residence at the time was in Brooklyn, New York, is accused of lying on a rider to that mortgage, which required her to use the Norfolk home as a secondary residence and not rent the property, according to the indictment. "The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served," Halligan said. James, in a statement, said, "This is nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system. He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York State Attorney General." She called the charges "baseless," saying that Trump's "own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost. "The president's actions are a grave violation of our Constitutional order and have drawn sharp criticism from members of both parties," James said. The case has been assigned to Judge Jamar Walker, who was appointed to the bench in 2023 by then-President Joe Biden. If convicted, James faces a maximum possible sentence of 30 years in prison, and up to a $1 million fine on each count. Any actual sentence would likely be much less severe given federal sentencing guidelines. Halligan on Sept. 25 obtained a criminal indictment against Comey, on charges related to his allegedly lying to Congress in 2020. Comey pleaded not guilty during a court appearance in Alexandria on Wednesday and was scheduled to stand trial on Jan. 5. Halligan's predecessor as acting U.S. Attorney, Erik Siebert, resigned on Sept. 19, shortly after Trump said he wanted him gone. Siebert told Justice Department officials before he quit that "investigators found insufficient evidence to bring charges against Ms. James and had also raised concerns about a potential case against Mr. Comey," The New York Times reported on the day he resigned. Kathy Hochul blasted the indictment of her fellow Democrat James. James' indictment comes three days after MSNBC reported that a top prosecutor in Halligan's office, Elizabeth Yusi, was resisting pressure to ask a grand jury to charge James. "Yusi ... has confided to co-workers that she sees no probable cause to believe James engaged in mortgage fraud, the two sources told MSNBC," that report on Monday said. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte in April made a criminal referral against James with the U.S. Justice Department, saying she had in multiple instances falsified bank documents and property records in connection with the Norfolk home and a New York property. Pulte has made similar accusations about purported mortgage fraud against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Trump cited those claims in August when he tried to fire Cook, who, like James, is the first Black woman to hold her position. In early September, James asked New York state's highest court to overturn an appeals court's decision tossing out the $500 million penalty imposed on Trump and his company in the business fraud case. "I stand strongly behind my office's litigation against the Trump Organization," James said in her statement on Thursday. "We conducted a two-year investigation based on the facts and evidence – not politics," she said. "Judges have upheld the trial court's finding that Donald Trump, his company, and his two sons are liable for fraud." "I am a proud woman of faith, and I know that faith and fear cannot share the same space," James said. "And so today I am not fearful, I am fearless, and as my faith teaches me, no weapon formed against me shall prosper. We will fight these baseless charges aggressively, and my office will continue to fiercely protect New Yorkers and their rights. And I will continue to do my job."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Treasury finalized a $20 billion currency swap framework with Argentina and bought pesos in the open market on Thursday, making good on President Donald Trump's pledge to prop up the wobbling country and sending the peso and Argentine dollar bonds sharply higher. "The U.S. Treasury is prepared, immediately, to take whatever exceptional measures are warranted to provide stability to markets," U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in announcing the actions on X. Last month, they touched a 2025 low, days before Bessent's initial support pledge. Bessent issued his statement at the end of four days of meetings with Argentine Finance Minister Luis Caputo that also involved officials from the International Monetary Fund. In April, the IMF granted Argentina a new $20 billion loan program. A spokesperson for the IMF did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.S. actions. "Argentina faces a moment of acute illiquidity," Bessent said in his post. "The international community – including @IMFNews – is unified behind Argentina and its prudent fiscal strategy, but only the United States can act swiftly. To that end, we directly purchased Argentine pesos." A U.S. Treasury spokesperson declined to provide any further details, including on the amount of pesos purchased and how the $20 billion currency swap line would be structured. Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. Senate complained that Trump was moving to provide financing to bail out a foreign government and global investors, even as the U.S. government has been shut down. Previously, Bessent had pledged the use of the Treasury's $221 billion Exchange Stabilization Fund and its holdings of IMF reserve assets known as Special Drawing Rights to support Argentina. The backstop is partly aimed at giving Argentina's right-wing president, Javier Milei, a boost in Argentina's October 26 mid-term legislative elections. Although the effect on financial markets was immediate, there was no guarantee the U.S. backstop will improve Milei's party's election prospects as public dissent over his austerity measures has grown. UBS's Shamaila Khan, head of fixed income for emerging markets and Asia Pacific, said the announcement was likely to bolster prospects for Milei's party. Bessent called the success of Milei's reforms of "systemic importance," to the U.S. by helping to anchor a prosperous Western Hemisphere. Milei, who is due to meet Trump next week during the IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington, thanked Bessent and Trump in a message on X. We will work hard every day to provide opportunity for our people," Milei wrote. Investors greeted the intervention with a sigh of relief. Eduardo Ordonez Bueso, emerging markets debt portfolio manager at BankInvest, said markets had been hungry for details of Bessent's support pledge and had been challenging peso valuations. "If they hadn't come through with a promise they made...we would be talking about a complete collapse of Argentina," he said. Several U.S. Senate Democrats introduced legislation that would prohibit the use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund to bail out Argentina and global investors. "It is inexplicable that President Trump is propping up a foreign government, while he shuts down our own," said Senator Elizabeth Warren, referring to the partial government shutdown due to lack of funding.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla is facing a federal investigation into possible safety defects with FSD, its partially automated driving system that is also known as Full Self-Driving (Supervised). Media, vehicle owner and other incident reports to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration showed that in 44 separate incidents, Tesla drivers using FSD said the system caused them to run a red light, steer into oncoming traffic or commit other traffic safety violations leading to collisions, including some that injured people. In a notice posted to the agency's website on Thursday, NHTSA said the investigation concerns "all Tesla vehicles that have been equipped with FSD (Supervised) or FSD (Beta)," which is an estimated 2,882,566 of the company's electric cars. Tesla cars, even with FSD engaged, require a human driver ready to brake or steer at any time. The NHTSA Office of Defects Investigation opened a Preliminary Evaluation to "assess whether there was prior warning or adequate time for the driver to respond to the unexpected behavior" by Tesla's FSD, or "to safely supervise the automated driving task," among other things. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on the new federal probe. For years, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has promised investors that Tesla would someday be able to turn their existing electric vehicles into robotaxis, capable of generating income for owners while they sleep or go on vacation, with a simple software update. That hasn't happened yet, and Tesla has since informed owners that future upgrades will require new hardware as well as software releases. Tesla is testing a Robotaxi-brand ride-hailing service in Texas and elsewhere, but it includes human safety drivers or valets on board who either conduct the drives or manually intervene as needed. In February this year, Musk and President Donald Trump slashed NHTSA staff as part of a broader effort to reduce the federal workforce, impacting the agency's ability to investigate vehicle safety and regulate autonomous vehicles, The Washington Post first reported.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has met with Jared Isaacman to discuss another nomination to lead NASA, a source familiar with the talks confirmed to CNBC's Morgan Brennan. Isaacman, who has close ties with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, was at the White House in September for Trump's dinner for tech power players. Trump and Isaacman have had multiple in-person meetings in recent weeks to talk about the Shift4 founder's vision for the space program, according to Bloomberg,  citing a person familiar with the meetings. After a fiery back-and-forth between Musk and Trump over government spending, the president pulled Isaacman's nomination for the post, saying he was a "blue blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before." "I also thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon's corporate life," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on June 6. Trump named Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy interim head of NASA in July. Isaacman is a seasoned space traveller, having led two private spaceflights with SpaceX in 2021 and 2024. Shift4 has invested $27.5 million in SpaceX, according to a 2021 filing. Isaacman stepped down as CEO from Shift4, the payments company he founded in 1999 at the age of 16, after his nomination was pulled, and now serves as executive chairman. "Even knowing the outcome, I would do it all over again," Isaacman wrote about the NASA nomination process in a letter to investors announcing the Shift4 change. Tensions between Musk and Trump have cooled in the months since, but big challenges face the U.S. space program.. Trump has proposed cutting more than $6 billion from NASA's budget. During the October government shutdown, NASA has made exceptions that allow employees to keep working on missions involving Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin.

Serve Robotics is trying to get as many businesses as possible to use its cooler-shaped delivery robots — even if it means teaming up with an apparent rival. On Thursday, the companies said Serve's robots would start making deliveries for DoorDash in Los Angeles, a city where Serve already works with Uber Eats. Working with DoorDash, which unveiled its own delivery robot last month, might seem counterintuitive. But Ali Kashani, Serve's CEO, said that DoorDash's Dot is more complementary than threatening to his company. "We are all going to try different approaches and see which one of them makes the most sense," Kashani told Business Insider in an interview.. The goal is to make delivery robots more like ride-hailing drivers, who switch between working for Uber and Lyft depending on where they can pick up work. "We want to be an infrastructure that everybody can use." Shares of Serve were trading 26% higher on Thursday after the announcement. Autonomous vehicles — be they cars or delivery bots — are becoming more common on the sidewalks and streets of US cities. Tesla also started its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin around the same time. Smaller self-driving delivery vehicles are also gaining ground, though executives say that using robots for delivery presents a different set of challenges, such as handing off orders from the restaurant to the robot. Last month, DoorDash unveiled Dot, a stroller-sized delivery robot it developed in-house. While getting around through ride-hailing has become a habit for many consumers, Kashani said that having things delivered is more ubiquitous — and is, potentially, a bigger market for self-driving technology. "Everybody is very distracted by self-driving cars to move people," he said. I actually think it's as big, if not bigger, than the movement of people."</p>

Ukraine's escalating attacks on Russia's energy sector are biting into its economy and war chest, forcing Moscow to tap into emergency gas reserves, Kyiv said this week. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday night that "long-range sanctions against Russia," a reference to its deep-strike campaign targeting Russian energy facilities, is "achieving truly significant results." Ukraine has been targeting infrastructure across Russia, including refineries, with long-range weapons to turn up the pressure on Moscow. "The fuel shortage in Russia is already approaching 20% — this specifically concerns their gasoline," Zelenskyy said, citing Ukrainian data. Ukrainian drones have struck targets far beyond the front lines, sometimes hundreds of miles into Russian territory. Ukraine has primarily used homemade missiles and drones to strike deep inside Russia, investing heavily in the production of weapons as a workaround to the restrictions and shortages it faced in using Western-provided cruise and tactical ballistic missiles to hit across the border. Zelenskyy on Wednesday praised Ukraine's weapons makers and said they were working to ensure that Russia bears the cost of the war. The attacks on Russia's energy infrastructure have leaned predominantly on drones; however, Ukraine has also used domestically produced cruise missiles and hybrid missile-drones to strike Russian targets. This one industrial sector is estimated to be worth approximately 20% of Russia's GDP on average. Kyle Glen, an investigator with the UK-based Centre for Information Resilience who tracks Ukrainian strikes on Russia's energy sector, told Business Insider that there have been 24 attacks on oil refineries since the start of August. The ability to strike these facilities has been crucial for Ukraine, even when it faces challenges such as battlefield setbacks or shortages of weapons and ammunition from its partners. Kyiv views these efforts as an opportunity to weaken Russia and project power. The deep-strike campaign has been a bright spot for Ukraine as its forces continue to defend against the invading Russians, with relatively static front lines and mounting losses. The escalating campaign comes amid Ukraine's expanding ability to strike high-profile Russian targets — like warships, aircraft, bases, factories, and ammunition production sites — far beyond its borders, with its own weaponry, hampering Russia's war machine and preventing the conflict from being fought solely on Ukrainian soil. Nightly attacks, consisting of large numbers of drones and missiles, hammer civilian areas and critical infrastructure, including the country's energy sector. Bombardments sometimes involve hundreds of munitions as Moscow ramps up its own weapons production.</p>

Chip Wars:

Intel Corp., the embattled chipmaker now backed by the US government, introduced new products and manufacturing technology that are central to its turnaround bid.

The company announced Thursday that its Panther Lake processor designs are in full production and will go on sale in laptops early next year. The new chips are made with 18A technology, which Intel says offers advantages that none of its competitors can match yet.</p>

When Anshul Gandhi graduated from dental school in India, the idea of working for a company like Apple — let alone as a machine learning engineer — felt far beyond his reach. But 11 years later, after moving to the US for graduate school and navigating multiple job transitions, that's exactly where he ended up. During his final years of dental school, Gandhi realized the profession wasn't for him. "Deep down, I knew it wasn't something I wanted to do for the rest of my life," said Gandhi, who's in his 30s and lives in Austin. Gandhi said he'd taken computer science courses in high school, which gave him some familiarity with the coding languages C++ and Java. During his final year of dental school, he enrolled in a few programming courses, which he said helped him develop his coding skills. In the years that followed, Gandhi would set his sights on an even bigger goal: landing an AI role at one of the largest US tech companies. However, his lack of formal education and work experience in the field, combined with a competitive tech job market, posed a real challenge. Gandhi is among the professionals who've pursued AI roles in recent years, as major tech companies like Meta and Google collectively invest billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. While several tech giants have laid off workers in recent years, many are aggressively chasing AI talent and offering eye-popping pay packages. While AI roles are competitive, some job seekers have found ways to break through. If you're open to sharing your story, please fill out one of the linked Google Forms above or contact this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com (or Signal at jzinkula.29). After graduating from dental school in 2013, Gandhi said he secured a data analysis role in India that provided him with more hands-on programming experience. He also connected with computer science engineers who helped him find online boot camps and side projects focused on AI and machine learning. His early exposure to AI helped him build expertise that felt relatively niche at the time. "At that time, nobody was talking about AI," he said. After a few years, Gandhi decided he wanted more practical knowledge and hands-on experience in AI and machine learning, so he started applying to graduate school programs. In 2016, he moved to the US to pursue a master's degree in biomedical informatics at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. He hoped the degree would give him a strong foundation in AI and data science, while also allowing him to build on his healthcare background. "It gave me the technical depth I was looking for, while still feeling connected to my previous experience," he said. While Gandhi was generally happy with his new position, he hadn't given up on his goal of working at one of the largest US tech companies. "And that kind of scale, you only get from working for a company like Meta, Amazon, Google, Netflix, or Apple." Around August 2024, Gandhi began looking for a new role, he said. He said demand for generative AI-specific skills — rather than traditional machine learning expertise — had surged, and the bar for technical proficiency was higher than ever. "This round of hiring was totally different," he said. One of the first steps he took to boost his chances was becoming more active on LinkedIn. To boost his LinkedIn presence, Gandhi began connecting with more people. He now has over 500 connections and more than 3,000 followers. Over the past year, he has also begun posting his thoughts on the tech industry, aiming to establish himself as an expert in AI and machine learning. Gandhi said he learned two other things during the early stages of his job search. One was that he needed to be more selective about what roles he applied for, prioritizing positions that were the best fit. While Gandhi continued to reach out to strangers on LinkedIn for referrals, he said he also began investing time in building a minimal online relationship first. "I realized that you have to keep engaging with their content, sharing your thoughts, and let them know that you not only exist, but are also a thought leader in your field." Gandhi said his experience working in the AI field helped him land interviews at multiple companies without referrals, including PayPal. When preparing for machine learning interviews, Gandhi recommends practicing LeetCode problems, mock interviews, and system-design drills — as well as familiarizing oneself with agent-based AI, retrieval-augmented generation, prompt tuning, and inference engines. Gandhi said among the top takeaways from his job search journey is that career pivots — even unconventional ones — are possible. So you can start over, even if it feels impossible."</p>

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Leigh Coney, a 34-year-old AI consultant based in France. It's been edited for length and clarity. AI models can tend to be "yes-men." Part of the reason I think so many AI projects fail is because the human factor is overlooked. I decided to pivot from teaching psychology at a university to becoming an AI consultant after Microsoft announced Copilot for its products nearly three years ago. At that moment, I decided AI would be in every business. Now, I build custom AI automations and agents for businesses across many industries to increase efficiency and growth, using my psychological background to interact better with AI. My goal is to uncover things I'm not thinking about by asking questions like "where am I not being clear in my thinking?" AI is particularly useful for expanding our thinking by uncovering perspectives we could be missing. Let's say you're pitching an idea to a CFO. Tell your chatbot to "Act as a skeptical CFO and ask five hard-hitting questions. Not only will it prepare you for the pitch, but it will also give you better output. The questions may even be more valuable than the answers because they force you to think about things you didn't think about before. Little wording tweaks in our prompts not only change how we feel, but can also change how AI responds. Frame our recent challenge as a critical learning moment that has revealed two insights for making the final product even better. Focus on our resilience and the path forward." If I'm using a chatbot to work on something important, I test out many different versions of my prompt in different chats. I tweak some words, sometimes just one, and it actually makes a really big difference in the response I get. The speed at which AI was advancing made me a bit concerned about jobs and employment, but since the personally underwhelming GPT5 release, I think we've got a lot more time than I previously assumed. To me, this is good news for our job market. Are you an AI expert with tips to share? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.</p>

"There isn't a risk-adjusted better return than OpenAI, and therefore if we're given a decision, we should do it," he said about investing more in the company. "At the same time, you can't not take a risk because of that," he added. Hankes did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. At its DevDay event on Monday, the company announced it's bringing apps inside ChatGPT, which CEO Sam Altman said now has 800 million weekly users. OpenAI also unveiled an app software development kit that allows developers to build their own apps for ChatGPT.

New York City is taking on some of the biggest names in tech. In a 327-page lawsuit filed Wednesday in the Manhattan federal court, the city alleged that Meta, Alphabet, Snap, and ByteDance created a "public nuisance" and a "youth mental health crisis" by intentionally exploiting the psychology of young users to keep them hooked. The city alleged in the complaint that the platforms' algorithms are designed to maximize engagement at the expense of children's mental health, contributing to sleep loss, chronic absenteeism, and risky behavior such as "subway surfing," meaning riding on top of moving trains. "One such dangerous type of conduct known to be spreading through viral social media posts is 'subway surfing.'" The lawsuit cited data from the NYC Police Department that at least 16 teens have died in such incidents since 2023, including two girls aged 12 and 13, who died this month. The NYC Mayor's office, Meta, TikTok, and Snapchat did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The NYC Law Department said in a statement to Business Insider that social media has resulted in "substantial interference" with school district operations and public hospitals that provide mental health services to youth. The City School District of the City of New York and New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation are also plaintiffs in the case. "These lawsuits fundamentally misunderstand how YouTube works and the allegations are simply not true," José Castañeda, a Google spokesperson, told Business Insider. In 2024, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, faced a room full of families who said their children had suffered harm from social media. NYC withdrew from a similar litigation announced by Mayor Eric Adams in February 2024, which was pending in California state courts, so that it could join the new federal litigation.</p>
